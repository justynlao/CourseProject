Joel “Kobayashi” Embiid
When do they play the nuggets? Or the 76ers next? I'm curious how joel embiid or jokic will do against them.
"East front court is stacked but I definitely think he makes it. Here is a table of the players that I think are genuine contenders for an All-Star spot in the East front court, with the players I deem to current be a lock bolded. Sabonis is 90% of the way to being a lock and I'd be really surprised if he didn't make it at this stage.        |Player|Pos|Conf|Tm|G|PTS▼|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|3P|FG%|3P%|FT%| :--|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |**Kevin Durant**|F|E|BRK|16|30.9|7.4|5.6|0.8|1.4|2.9|0.520|0.447|0.873| |**Joel Embiid**|F|E|PHI|16|28.3|11.1|2.8|1.2|1.3|1.2|0.544|0.404|0.840| |**Giannis Antetokounmpo**|F|E|MIL|19|27.3|11.0|5.7|1.1|1.1|1.2|0.558|0.280|0.593| |**Jayson Tatum**|F|E|BOS|13|26.8|7.0|3.7|1.2|0.7|3.1|0.484|0.435|0.833| |Jerami Grant|F|E|DET|20|23.6|5.9|2.9|0.9|1.1|2.6|0.448|0.402|0.866| |Gordon Hayward|F|E|CHO|20|23.0|5.3|3.6|1.3|0.6|2.3|0.503|0.430|0.856| |Nikola Vučević|F|E|ORL|21|22.6|10.9|3.5|1.1|0.5|2.7|0.478|0.441|0.837| |Julius Randle|F|E|NYK|22|22.4|11.1|6.0|0.8|0.2|1.4|0.471|0.369|0.816| |Khris Middleton|F|E|MIL|20|21.2|6.4|6.0|1.1|0.2|2.7|0.517|0.458|0.922| |\**Domantas Sabonis**|F|E|IND|20|20.6|12.0|5.7|0.8|0.4|0.9|0.543|0.327|0.696| |Tobias Harris|F|E|PHI|18|20.3|7.0|2.7|0.9|1.0|2.2|0.514|0.464|0.833| |Bam Adebayo|F|E|MIA|18|20.1|9.3|5.3|0.8|0.9|0.1|0.588|0.400|0.860|"
"kyrie played 15 games this season so far. Joel Embiid, everyone has him as a lock, has played 16 games."
"No, I am not saying casual fans have no grasp of the sport, rather, I am saying that casual fans don't care about whether someone accidentally calls Landry Shamet ""Chris Chiozza"".   If the announcers are out here calling LeBron James ""Joel Embiid"" then sure it's an issue but Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza nobody cares."
"Tell me more about how average at best defender, 6’5” James harden is a bad matchup for Joel Embiid"
Well he lost so I guess his *substantial gap over Joel Embiid and thus Nikola Jokic remained unchanged.*
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are better than either Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Is that really a hot take?
"""You're eating everything I worked for.""  -Joel ""Blessed"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid is your new overlord.
"Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokić are two centers leading the MVP race so far, which is great for the league and from people saying that big men were becoming irrelevant"
"Wrong.  Top 10 in order and if you disagree you’re wrong.  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić"
Thanks! Just ordered a joel embiid one
The Sixers would vastly improve with CP3/Embiid.  Now that's a fucking deadly combo. I've always said this. Don't care about no James Harden or Beal to play with Joel. CP3 would take Embiid even a step further.
I’d fight Joel Embiid
"&gt;Like bruh he is the team’s offense, he can’t lock down the paint every possession too  Joel Embiid is Philly’s offense as well as our defensive anchor. This isn’t a knock on Jokic, he’s arguably the MVP front runner right now (not LeBron) and rightfully so.   He looks like he can actually keep pace with the flow of the game now and it’s amazing to see. His offense is tremendous, more than enough to warrant serious MVP consideration, but we can’t say he can’t play defense. He can. It just looks like he’s choosing offense over defense. Can’t totally fault him for that as you can tell by OP stats, but I think it means something, definitely when you have to get by Anthony Davis in a seven game series more likely than not to make the finals"
"If Jokic doesn't win this year it's a crime.  He's been the definition of ""does it all for his team and elevates them during the regular season"".  If he wasn't this good their record wouldn't be either.  You can say the same about LeBron of course but Jokic is doing it every way vs every team, every single night between scoring or stuffing the stat sheet.  This is a mega robbery if he doesn't win.  Personally wouldn't be surprised if LeBron gets it because we know this is the entertainment business disguised as basketball and everyone involved is an entertainer disguised as either an analyst or something else, but from a bball perspective Jokic is running away with MVP as it stands.  He just isn't recognizable, or marketable, and he plays in a meh market, and unfortunately, those things mean the most in basketball.  Jokic is gonna get robbed and only true fans will remember.  Him being second to Embiid is also name recognition although Joel is killing it."
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
"Joel Embiid has seemed to turn his biggest weakness into a strength. He used to panic when he got doubled, leading to a lot of turnovers. This year he always makes the right play. He even baits doubles just to make a play now. Now he’s even shooting the 3 at 40% on 2.9 per game. All of a sudden he is extremely efficient on an crazy usage rate on offense, while still being a premier defender in the league."
"Embiid isn’t just a better shot blocker, he’s just a far superior defender. Denver’s defense drastically improves when Jokic leaves the court, Philly’s defense gets worse when Joel isn’t there.  Also Jokic is having by far his best season scoring-wise, but he’s still averaging fewer points on worse efficiency than Embiid while playing 4 more minutes a game."
"**Most Dominant Player:** Joel Embiid  **Most Impactful Free Agent Signing:** Gordon Hayward  **Most Dangerous Lineup That Doesn’t Actually Play:** Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Serge Ibaka, Marcus Morris Sr.  **All-Around Strangest Development:** Andrew Wiggins becoming mini Mutombo  **Breakout Sidekick:** De’Andre Hunter  **Sunniest Bounce Back:** Mike Conley  **Most Concerning Start (That Actually Matters):** Josh Richardson"
"Yep I see it in a multitude of ways as to why they won’t make it, it’s the first season and that’s always when super teams are weakest as they have to develop chemistry on both sides of the ball that produce good basketball. Next defensively they’re awful and it’s not just numbers really, thinking about who they play on the floor it’s a scary thought that KD during crunch time might be their best defender on the perimeter is both not a good thing for their defense but also simultaneously KD as he’s going to be counted upon more and more on an Achilles tear which is never good. Next they have absolutely no rim protection and truly only have height off of DJ who’s not anywhere near being a good defender anymore and he’s the only one around 7 foot except KD that plays frequent minutes. After that my thought process is how the fuck are they even planning to play teams like the Bucks who have the Greek Freak finishing around Shaq levels around the rim all while drawing fouls on their one big DJ in the playoffs. (who not to mention cannot shoot FTs although I have no concerns on Offense so this a mute point.) And I don’t have the numbers on this from the first encounter but also this is a prediction I think the bucks team have the perfect matchups on defense who can slow down at least one of their big three stars so they won’t have enough scoring. Or just like the 76ers who have Joel Embiid who will draw fouls and drop 30 on DJ with his eyes clothes all while having defense that can stifle them even a bit will be enough. Every team they play will easily be able to drive to the rim at will with no resistance if they beat their man. I think this Nets team will make it next season but they just don’t have it this season to even make it out the East."
"Oh no! Stupid embiid he should have just played the game that he missed because of quarantine, he also should have been a real high IQ player like Jokic and not let LeBron push him mid air so he lands badly on his back. Jeez what a fuckin idiot that Joel is"
""" With Simmons without Embiid - -13.23 net rating"" that stood out more to me.  However, I think we should take everything with a grain of salt so far, especially this year when the schedule of strength and matchup is something we need to look heavily into.  Also there's just not enough data to make an conclusion based on these numbers.  &amp;#x200B;  We can expand adding Tobias Harris into the mix: and the data changes which you probably can't conclude anything except for the 76ers are damn good this year.

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  All these reasons just could be due to a change of coach, I think Simmons and Joel is fine, but I think with Tobias playing like he is now, Ben cannot produce max impact for his potential.  &amp;#x200B;  You can look at other figures from previous years - and including only the games that all 3 were playing.  2019-2020   [https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612755&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1627732,203954,202699&amp;OnlyCommonGames=true](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612755&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=1627732,203954,202699&amp;OnlyCommonGames=true)  2018-2019  [https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612755&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=202710,203954,1627732,202699&amp;OnlyCommonGames=true](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612755&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=202710,203954,1627732,202699&amp;OnlyCommonGames=true)  There's pretty consistent data that although Ben is still a net positive, there might be other options in the league that suit the 76ers at the moment, especially from a 'package' you can get for someone as talented as he."
"Lmao. Bro really only watches youtube highlights of each game. They haven't played the Jazz, Celtics, Warriors or Sixers since they traded Harden for their depth and interior defense. But sure I'm the idiot.   You are unable to see that the Nets team from before and the Nets team now are two different things because you only watch YouTube highlights.  Joel Embiid will literally dominate the Nets. They let Vuc seem like the second coming off Shaq. They lost to the worst team in the NBA,  barely beat the Hawks who don't have their entire roster healthy, barely beat the Heat one game who don't have Jimmy Butler or half their roster (Bam went off which is going to keep happening),  lost to the Cavs twice,  and barely beat Vuc.   Notice in almost every game, some body on the other team has a fucking career night. Its because they have NO DEFENSE. No NBA teams has won the final in the past decade without a top ten defense.   You better hope the Nets defense improves. Or else they are getting bounced early."
"I’m amazed how many of you guys (Sixer fans) are downplaying how well the team is constructed this season. The signs are there, this team is legit: - PF-sized ball-handler and a legit unicorn surrounded by three 3&amp;D-ish guys, - they have both an elite defender at the point of attack (Ben) and at the rim (Joel), - their best two players are also their two biggest players (important when teams try smallball lineups), - they can contain players that play bullyball from the perimeter with Ben and bullyball in the post with Joel,  - They’re still getting reps in for that high-post p&amp;r between Embiid and Simmons, but boy oh boy will that be dangerous in the playoffs."
"Very excited for Game 7 of the ECF where Philadelphia beats the Nets 251-249 on the back of an incredible 200 point game from Joel Embiid.  For real it's astounding how many points these guys are giving up. I hope they don't burn out Kyrie, Durant, and Harden by having them play so many minutes in all these games."
Why not both? ((Joel Embiid) sent with invisible ink).
"Barring injury, they’ll surely get out of the East. The offense has been good since Ben, Joel &amp; Tobias went back to their pre-Horford roles.   And their team defense is looking so good right now, they’re like the 2019 Raptors who kept winning despite Kawhi’s load management.   P/s: Embiid with good conditioning is a cheat code against teams still wanting to play smallball, i dont see any East team consistently containing him over 7 games anymore."
"Certain players get hurt a lot and people think it has to do with bad diet and training, joel embiid for instance has never played 70 games of an 82 game season and hes like 25"
"It’s kind of almost unfair that we not only have one DPOY caliber player, but THREE. Lmao. And we only had 2 of the 3 tonight without Embiid  But for real. Having Ben, Thybulle, and Joel on our team we are always gonna be an elite defense. I love it"
Sixers did a great job but this game was on Bjorkgren   You got Sabonis who’s tailor made to just shred a zone if you put him in the middle at the top of the key or FT line to facilitate offense. They didn’t do it at all  Instead it was just pick and roll with TJ or Brogdon. They could never hit Sabonis or Turner on the roll partly because Philly packed up the paint. Easy solution is to just get a shooter on the weak side and kick it out that way amongst other stuff you can do to capitalize on it. And they never did at all. Just the same shit every time embarrassing  Also Myles Turner wanted the Joel Embiid smoke but couldn’t even handle Dwight Howard without fouling out. Also not good
*Without Joel Embiid
[Myles Turner decided yesterday to announce he was ready to step up to the challenge of Joel Embiid and then a day later put up 9 points/5 rebounds and fouled out against Tony Bradley and 35 year old Dwight Howard.](https://twitter.com/dansbadtweets/status/1356065509880582147?s=19)
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
So you’re going to conveniently forgetting when Ben won us 16 games in a row without jo? Like how is a game with tony Bradley starting what you base your opinion off of? Or are you going by the other games this year when Ben was recovering from injury and our roster was wiped out by COVID? Like did you watch the playoffs last year and think wow a team with Joel Embiid as their best player is a perennial first round sweep? It’s really hard I know but try to use your brain and think about things that happened before this game
This might sound like Im hating on big honey but Jokic at #1 by far is just recent bias. His team started way off and is still far from the number 1 seed. Meanwhile Joel is posying up Shaq line numbers while playing 3 quarters.  Im not saying Embiid for MVP for as of now its definetly close while favouring the later
"Ben handles the ball, but the Embiid is the centerpiece of the offense, a huge portion of possessions are based around him working in the post and either scoring or passing to an open man.  Steals matter, but again, I prefer to look at stats that summarize overall defensive impact, and those clearly show Embiid is a far better defender  Also, that chart shows Joel at or above league average from the midrange everywhere except middle center, where he only took 41 shots"
"I am convinced this was written by Joel Embiid on his burner account, only thing that makes sense here"
"I'm looking at Embiid's shot chart from last year, [and he was not an efficient mid-range shooter at all.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=joel+embiid+shot+chart+2019-2020) I can't find stats for this year, so maybe that's changed? It's pretty silly to say that steals don't correlate well with defense. It's always been one of the most important factors in consideration for the DPOY and the league leader in steals wins it pretty often.  If Embiid runs the offense, what the hell is Ben Simmons for?"
"I mean if stats and the eye test and team records and efficiency in game can’t convince you, you might hold an irrational belief.  Your point about him not being considered great becaus he isn’t American or didn’t go to an American college is ridiculous.  Joel Embiid isn’t American bud.  Literally the most currently hyped up player in the NBA and the so called “future of the league” is also not American, and he didn’t even attend a school in the United States (Luka).  That same kid people were saying was an MVP candidate in his second season (If it hadnt been for their record he mightve had a serious chance).  If you’re going to come up with a counterargument, don’t make the dumbest and most inaccurate one possible.  You can say Embiid is not close to Jokic, but all metrics tell the averagely intelligent NBA fan that Embiid and Jokic are 1a and 1b.  Jokic is a great player and the 2nd best center in the league, but man does he get overhyped over the Bubble playoffs and his assist stats.  I’m not saying Jokic isn’t an MVP candidate, I’m just saying you have to be an actual smoothbrain to believe that there is any gap between Jokic and Embiid, let alone thinking Jokic would be the one who is ahead."
those guys make many people hate a great player in joel embiid just because of their ignorance
"Steals are not a good defensive metric. If you look at advanced defensive stats like 538's defensive raptor, Jokic is basically a net even defender, while Joel is a huge positive on defense.  Embiid plays off ball, the offense runs through him, and he can shoot from anywhere as well"
"Bro in on your side here, and think Jokic is the better player, but if he’s the best 5 in the league. Embiid is clearly number 2, and it’s very close. Number 3 not even on the same page, put some respect on Joel he’s been ballin lately"
"For his career I've compared Jokic to Ben Simmons on offense. I know that's gonna cause some alarm but stay with me here. *Before this season* people said he was better at offense than Embiid, but I legitimately couldn't see why. For his career to that point he scored slightly better than Simmons and assisted a little worse than Simmons. So I thought his offensive impact was about that level (which is really fucking high btw, it's just no one seems to care about points generated through assists when discussing Ben for some reason).   *This* season he is scoring *significantly higher* than his previous career high of 20ppg and he's raised his assists numbers up higher too. I think this version of Jokic is as impactful if not more than Joel Embiid and much more impactful than Simmons if he keeps up this torrid pace.   My only thing that I would say is people are acting like he was always this guy and her just was not. He was amazing, but this year he has taken a quantum leap in his scoring ability. Nuggets fans would always talk about his percentages like he could drop 25 a night if he decided too. My counter was that if he could he would. If Seth Curry could take as many threes as Steph Curry and keep his percentages he would. But this year not only is he scoring more he's doing so with greater efficiency and even more offensive responsibility."
"Embiid is better at being the best player on a team, Davis can slide into any team pretty easily. Who would I build around? Joel. Would I rather have him on the Lakers instead of Davis? Probably not"
My MVP favorites are:  1. Joel Embiid 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James
This is coming from a Sixers fan as you can obviously tell so let’s say the Lakers offered us Anthony Davis for Joel Embiid straight up I wouldn’t do it.
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić."
Kawhi Leonard deserves it more than Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokić.  Kevin Durant and LeBron James should be the favorites to win MVP though. Interesting that the top 3 MVP candidates are the 3 best players in the NBA (in order).
"I agree with you honestly, adding JJ would be awesome but I don’t see a reason to trade the number of assets it’d require to get him when we’ve been so hot with Seth filling essentially the same role. [see this](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2020/12/21/seth-curry-says-he-has-studied-old-sixers-film-of-jj-redick-joel-embiid/)"
"Joel embiid is a multi all defense selection, idk what you mean by that. Our aches funnel people to him"
"I think KAT is the player the most excuses are made for in the league. In isolation his game is fantastic, but this his what, 6th? Year in the league and he’s contributed to winning basketball once (I give him almost as much credit as Jimmy for that year, people say they fell from 3rd to 8th without jimmy, but they were like 3 games ahead, and missing your best player for 25 games does that. He also wasn’t worse than jimmy in those playoffs). But outside of that single year, when has he gotten enough shit done to be mentioned as a top 4 big in the league with Joel, Jokic and AD? His counting numbers are fantastic, but they just don’t win, and the wolves on paper never were as bad as they end up being. They lost a 17 point lead with like 2 minutes to go last year, which he played in. First time in 8500 of such instances. You think Embiid, Jokic or AD would’ve gotten a pass for that?"
Its like Joel Embiid fell off the Earth or something.
"I think Embiid and Smart are cool with each other even if they had fought before. I always see them helping each other up when they play and they give each other respect all the time after the game. Cool to see, Joel is a cool guy."
"I don't think he can make it with the amount of games he's missed.       These players should all make it before him for the final team:  |East|Pos|Team| :--|:--|:--| |Kyrie Irving|G|BRK|.   |Bradley Beal|G|WAS| |Kevin Durant|F|BRK| |Joel Embiid|F|PHI| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|MIL| |Trae Young|G|ATL| |James Harden|G|BRK| |Jayson Tatum|F|BOS| |Khris Middleton|F|MIL| |Domantans Sabonis|F|IND| |Zach LaVine|WC|CHI| |Jaylen Brown|WC|BOS|.        That's not even including other contenders like Bam, Vic, Randle, Hayward, Tobi, Brogdon and Sexton."
Lol I'll let the numbers talk. Joel is great defender but Jokic isn't bad and the numbers say so. There's an argument for MVP and you'd be stupid to say there isn't. Joel also gets hurt every 5 games and rests lmao come talk when Embiid can actually play a whole damn season.   It's easier in the east and the numbers say that too. People lie numbers don't.
Embiid is a probable MVP and has led the Sixers to heights AD never did as a Pelican. Gimme Joel
Joking was guarded by Zubac and Harrell lol. Why we acting like he dominated Joel Embiid or Rudy Gobert? Al Horford is so much better than Zubac.
"As a life long Philly fan and resident, everyone in this city and fan base love Joel with a burning passion. Ben is a different story. Embiid tho, we would tuck and roll into oncoming traffic for that man."
"Gasol is also an intelligent player with a lot of experience.  &amp;#x200B;  If you think about it he has had to deal with many different types of bigs in his career: Shaq (albeit post prime), Dwight, Cousins, Horford, Jokic, and Gobert. All of those players found success in very different ways. Plus, he had to guard power forwards like Dirk, KG, Duncan, Draymond, AD, Love, and Bosh.  &amp;#x200B;  There are people on that list who are better than Joel will ever be but none of them had his skills, speed, touch, and athleticism at his size. Gasol is smart enough to piece together what he learned from those experiences to know how to make life difficult for Embiid and he has the size to not allow him  to get straight up bullied either."
"It’s not as hard when the hard teams don’t play their good players lmao, this isn’t rocket science. Strength of schedule doesn’t include whether the Nets don’t play their two stars or Joel Embiid sitting."
Agree. The key is Embiid requiring every player to account for him at all times and allows other guys to feast even tho Joel will continue to get his no matter what you do.   The way to beat them is to out score them which unfortunately Brooklyn is capable of doing.

"\&gt; He could play like Shaq but he'd rather take low percentage sissy boy fadeaways   Shaq took a lot of fadeaways?  Kareem and Duncan took a lot of fadeaways?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvxnPWb0Fl0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvxnPWb0Fl0)  What made Shaq so scary was his size *combined* with his agility, footwork, and his ability to play over both shoulders.  By 2009 in Phoenix he was mostly doing fadeaways and hook shots because his agility was gone, and he still led the lead in FG%.  A Joel Embiid post-up including his mid-range game (out to \~11 feet) has a higher expected point value than a league-average 3-point shot.  It's fine.  He's a great mixture of everything you want from a big."
"When Simmons blow by someone to the hoop and forced centre come up to defend him. Ben will just passing it to Embiid, it's unstoppable and easy 2 points. Not only Joel and Ben, Harris has been playing well. Any team that try to defend Joel + Ben + Harris, it's often too much for teams because they are all 6'10+ players in a different position. Sixers will abuse on any mismatches, Harris vs Caruso on last play is the example for this."
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"Exactly. The irony is all of these talking heads keep saying he needs to get in the post more but the more he's in the post the more he's vulnerable to: offensive fouls usually from flops, ridiculously high amount of physical play allowed, double teams that come from blind spots causing turnovers, much more difficult passes overall. He's dominant in the post and still backs down more than anyone else but he has lessened that part of his game.   When he faces up: he can see the help and his shooters, he puts the big in a defensive position he is uncomfortable in, he goes from being allowed to have so much contact and force on him to basically being treated exactly like a perimeter player, meaning hands off and keep your distance while Joel sizes up this easy mid range J, and he can use his incredible quickness to go right by his defender because he is in a triple threat position.   This is a paradigm shift for Embiid. Similar to when James Harden stopped asking for screens (which often just brought a help defender to him) and started utilizing the step back instead to get his threes off."
"Embiid is not as dominant as Shaq in the paint. That's clear. One big factor in Shaq's favor is the rule changes making post play *much more difficult*.   However OP pointed out that their scoring numbers are similar and pointed to Embiid being a better shooter as the main reason why. I can agree with that.   But if we add another factor into the equation we can (in my opinion) see why Embiid closes the gap more than you'd expect just judging the two players. I think that while Shaq is definitely more dominant in the post than Embiid, Embiid *has a wider gap of dominance between him and the average defender he is facing.*  Shaq was the baddest man on the court, but he played in an era where good and even great centers were still very common. Embiid meanwhile, can sometimes play against teams with no true centers *by design*. Tonight for example the Timberwolves minus Towns (a player who has had very little success slowing Embiid down anyway) were left with one player with even close to the size necessary to even compete with Embiid; and he got in foul trouble very quickly.   It's a major benefit to Embiid that there are only a handful of centers in the league now that can even hope to anchor against him well enough for help to be effective. Marc Gasol, himself a throwback old school center, was one of these players for the longest time. Obviously Gobert is a dominant rim protector, but there aren't very many of these players.   Shaq didn't have to deal with rules designed against him for much of his career. And he also played in an era where the perimeter players didn't have so many rules in their favor, inherently making that style of play more efficient than post play. But he did have tougher competition in the paint.   So while I still think Shaq is the most dominant player of the modern era, and thus more dominant than Joel, if we add all these factors into the equation we start to see why Embiid has started to effect the game in a similar manner."
as a jazz fan whos currently not the biggest fan of shaq... joel embiid is no where near shaq level. Shaqs foot work and size and strength and speed were/are unmatched idk if you watched him much but the dude was literally unstoppable. joel embiid is good but not shaq good.
Jrich looked better on defense with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid on his team.
"You might need to rethink that statement. The sixers are looking really realllly nice. And imo I think they are currently better than the Bucks. Seriously, don't sleep on the Sixers.   Joel Embiid is killing it"
Joel Embiid
"I generally rate Jokic as the better offensive player just because of how consistently he effects every posession, but I've watched plenty of both this year and I think (so far) Embiid has been very close to Jokic offensively, especially while Embiid is shooting 40% from 3 (Jokic is at 33%) and scoring with overwhelming efficiency 67% TS. I think there will be some regression to the norm for Embiid with those shooting numbers which could give Jokic the edge offensively but for now this season I don't think theres much of a gap offensively. And defensively Joel is a DPOY candidate whereas Jokic is a neutral or negative in some situations.  Again, all this is so far and a lot can change (records/injuries/fluctuations in shooting etc) I just think that so far Joel has earned the distinction. I'm only talking about so far this year though so when comparing the players overall I have no qualms in people rating Jokic higher."
Joel Embiid is gonna put up like 70 tonight against the Miny Sota Timberwolves tn. Ed Davis is literally the only true big available

"Imagine Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, Dwight Howard, and Joel Embiid.  Fuck..."
No hate on the Joker. He’s been playing out of his mind and I’m sure he’s a “True Unicorn.” But can we take a moment to appreciate the lengths Bill Simmons is going to counter the LeMVP narrative? He did a 2 hour pod the other day where he praised nearly every other MVP contender as being a unique unicorn but asserted that LeBron is only tentatively a unicorn and that Davis is just a Kevin McHale knockoff. But we have never seen and will never see another player like Joel Embiid again for some reason. Now we are seeing regular Ringer bios coming for each other MVP contender.   I’m not even mad. The Ringer is like if one of us got our own sports website. I’m sure I’d be yelling at KOC to do 6 Alex Caruso articles a day and an expose on why Danny Ainge may have lost the Brooklyn trade once a week.  Having said all that - Joker is playing badass. It feels like he came into the season in playoff shape and has been setting the court on fire. True unicorn status confirmed.
"It does matters, I’m not disputing that. That’s actually the point I’m trying to make. The sixers are two different teams with and without Embiid. OP is alluding to the idea that somehow the eastern conference leading sixers are somehow comparable from the Suns (who are actually fairly solid) in terms of offensive and defensive ratings.   This just isn’t true. The sixers lost games without Joel, all of them actually (0-4). When he plays, we’re first in the East. That’s saying something. The Suns and sixers are not on the same level when both teams are at full health contrary to the point OP’s statistics make it sound like. That’s all I’m saying  Edit: and yeah Embiid hasn’t played every game but half of his DNP is from COVID protocol. You can fault him for built in rest and injuries, but holding COVID protocol against him just isn’t fair for any player at that"
Imagine going against a team that has prime Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid lol
Ummm did you mean to compare Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid?
Jamal Murray slaps Tim Hardaway Jr in the nuts: Ejected  LeBron James dangerously pushes Joel Embiid midair: Stays in the game
"I do think Joel is the MVP so far this season, but its not because of what LeBron HASN'T done, no, it's because of what Embiid HAS done."
"Yep, and its helped Tobi and Joel so much. And I think there is more to come from Ben as well. The defence is really nice too. Embiid can cover for Curry so well and Curry is actually a super smart defender who knows how to funnel players to Embiid/Howard. Also love the Dan Burke is always watching for little changes he can make especially to PnR coverage rather than being stubborn to the scheme like we were last year. I think Burke and Embiid communicate so well"
"I feel Like Lebron was expecting a lot more forward momentum from Embiid but Embiid pretty much jumped vertically, causing Lebron to push with too much force.   I wouldn't call it dirty, but it does seem to fit the flagrant 2 definition of ""excessive and unnecessary.""   Hell of a game. Glad Joel is okay."
"I think of it this way. Joel embiid is blatantly bigger and heavier than embiid, Joel looks like he was going up hard fke that dunk, and then just didn't. He went up super weak, trying to draw the foul, and almost hurt himself by creating contact and rolling with it."
"&gt; The likes of Jokic and Embiid are normmies and have seen the likes of them before.   Joel Embiid sixty years ago was a fella named Walt Bellamy.  Jokic forty years ago was a fella named Bill Walton.  Look those guys up, and many others.  &gt;This dude say Duncan was mediocre at best lmao.  I specifically said that he was a mediocre shooter beyond 3', and even provided you with the evidence supporting that.  If you are too stupid to understand such a simple point, I recommend that you just remain quiet, rather than flaunt your ignorance."
"&gt;If lebron was pushed around the chest area, he too would do the same thing as Joel.  I'm not going to spend all day arguing about this, but Lebron pushes Embiid in literally the exact same spot where Lebron gets pushed here by KG (the torso, slightly above the waist)."
"While I get that the play is dangerous. Let’s not forget that the refs, and the league take your foul history into consideration when making decisions about ejections and suspensions. Also let’s not forget that Embiid is known somewhat as a dirty player with all of the “hard fouls” that he commits. As for the “stare down” to be frank Joel talks a lot of shit, Russ hates him, Draymond doesn’t like him, Boogie doesn’t like him, Marcus Morris, etc... you get what you dish out. Do I agree with the flagrant foul? Yes, but I don’t agree with the “I lost respect for lebron” guys."
"No one's asking lebron to go fuckin diagnose joel embiid on the court. They're saying that a *You good bro?* from lebron would have been courteous, at the very least"
"LOL LeBron isn’t a doctor, why tf do you care about him checking up on Joel? LeBron haters pretending to be fans are hilarious 😂  Dude made a normal play and Embiid embellished the contact to sell the call. Bron haters really grasping at straws to get at him because their teams sure as shit not gonna beat them when it matters"
"Yeah honestly only player who does what he does at a higher level is Embiid, mainly because very similar defensive talents but Joel is much better on offense."
"I dunno, I crunched the numbers and I saw that the Nets do not have a Joel Embiid.   Ima go with the team with a Joel Embiid."
"He whines to the refs about every call and non call. He flagrantly fouled Embiid with a two handed shove while Joel was midair and could have injured him, but because its LeFranchise he wasn’t ejected from the game.  If you ask LeBron he’s never traveled in his career. He’s never pushed or elbowed someone. He’s never performed an illegal screen. Every single time a whistle is blown he screams at the refs to the point that you think he’s going to cry. He screams at his teammates when he’s frustrated. He screams at his coaches. He has a history of getting people traded and coaches fired. He is an emotional vagina."
Holy shit it’s like you guys can’t read. It literally lists the teams that I’m choosing the players from. I LITERALLY SAID EARLIER IN THIS SAME THREAD THAT JOEL EMBIID IS THE FRONTRUNNER FOR MVP.

Joel Embiid with one knee better than Ben Simmons with two confirmed. Simmons really needs to stop pretending him not being able to shoot is not a massive problem every time they get to the playoffs.
"I don’t think it was ever in the sixers hands was it? To answer your question, I mean, I enjoy watching those guys, I love having them on the team. Harden and embiid would be better than Simmons and embiid, obviously. And if they won the chip? Yeah I’d be happy. But I probably would’ve always thought ‘what if…’. Last year Simmons being out proved it wasn’t him holding us back, but this year? I don’t know. I don’t know what this year has proven. Ben and Joel haven’t been in the negative as a duo on the +/- yet, but what does that prove? Simmons being off the team would probably improve my mental health one way or the other haha"
Here's a telling stat for you:   Joel Embiid and Seth Curry are the only Sixers who made a FG in the 2nd half.  Joel is worn out cuz he has to carry the whole team for 4 quarters (on a torn meniscus). Seth can't even get his shots off without Embiid screening for him or passing out of a double. It's our only source of offense besides transition.
"They shouldve helped him on defense. They absolutely needed his shotmaking.  I think one of the problems was they used him too much as a ball handler. When the Hawks denied his shots, he doesnt really play make for others. Their offense was stagnant once Embiid and Seth werent scoring.   They repeated that double screen too much where nothing really happened with Simmons. Might as well just do a Seth Joel PnR if Simmons was gonna stare at the two."
What a flaming hypocrite you are  when your star player Joel embiid also hunts for fouls lmao
So why can Joel embiid be a superstar
"Embiid is on one knee, how about the other players besides curry score more than 6 points in the second half. Embiid and curry are the only reason we were in this game, they had over half our points and joel was a monster on D"
&gt;The problem is philly has no scorer who can force a switch and just body a useless defender.  I mean that's literally Joel Embiid.
He does it to prevent injury. But this is a pretty egregious (and dangerous) flop  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/05/10/joel-embiid-falls-down-a-lot-because-his-doctors-told-him-to/
"Top team or title contender doesn’t equal title favorite. There were the nets and lakers that were title favorites. And Clippers too since they upgraded their roster. Sixers were in the 2nd tier along with the bucks, heat, jazz etc. no one expected the sixers to be the favorite to win the title like they did the clippers.  Sixers are contenders every year cause they got Joel embiid. But Ben Simmons non development is holding them back from being an actual title favorites. And they’re showing that right now by sucking ass."
If you think Clint Capela is a better defender than Joel Embiid then you are trippin.  Embiid anchored the second best defense.
joel embiid and seth curry vs the world
"Man if you think Clint Capela is a better defensive player than Joel Embiid then you should test your piss.  Nate McMillan is great. But to think he turned Clint suddenly into an all-league defender is absurd, sir."
&gt;We would never be in a position to win without Joel.  Nobody is debating that. Youre arguing with yourself mate. Were saying for 2 games straight he has disappeared in the 4th. That is undeniable. Has the rest of the team also disappeared? 100%. But if embiid stayed consistent through the 4th you wouldve won the game easily.
"I disagree wholeheartedly, knowing he’s tried. The same way anyone can sing, anyone can shoot. It’s all about finding the right method. He is capable; we’ve seen him shoot threes. But he is [afraid to fail](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/sixers-ben-simmons-jump-shot-joel-embiid-brett-brown). He needs to get over it if they’re going to have any chance of winning a title."
"&gt; We would never be in a position to win without Joel.  I agree.  Does that change the fact that he choked those two free throws?  No, it doesn't.  Acknowledging that he choked doesn't mean he's trash or that he's he didn't have a great game.  &gt; Ben being shit at shooting is something that is consistent.  I also agree with this, and I think his free throw shooting is more problematic than whatever downfalls Embiid has.  However, just because Simmons has serious problems doesn't mean that Embiid doesn't have problems of his own.  I never said Embiid lost the game, I just said that he had his own share of problems in the game that contributed to losing.  One singular player is never to blame for losing a game."
"bucks by far. they havent been able to do shit against a hobbled nets team even though their core is healthy. fact of the matter is that joel Embiid is injured. bucks have been spoonfed 2 wins and even those looked shaky. their losses were disgusting. series might look close, but the bucks are a talented team shitting the bed.   bucks in 7"
"This is the second Hawks game in a row that I turned off a few minutes into the third quarter. I told myself there was no way they could do a repeat of game 4... but as you do I also decided to check back in the fourth quarter like I happened to do in game 4. Game 4 I started watching with about 2 minutes left in the 4th this game I started watching with about 6 minutes left because I was amazed that they got it down to 10 points... I know Joel embiid isn't one hundred percent but good God has someone on his team actually help him. This team disappears in the second half, and it's not to take anything away from the Atlanta Hawks but this shit is crazy"
"Docs Rivers said Ben Simmons is good at defense, and he found out in game 5 that defense brick 10 FTs out of 14 attempts. He is a good player, and can make an impact to a championship team. This current team does not maximize what Ben Simmons does well and hide his glaring weaknesses. What so great if he can defend, rebound, and pass but if other team can attack his weaknesses leave him to be the scorer and foul him to put him on FT line when he is on the floor. You can put him at the dunker spot and screen, but Joel Embiid operates there to be his best which mess with the spacing with Simmons. Seth Curry is only good shooting threat, and maybe hot Danny Green to provide space. If Simmons is not going to score by seeking it when opportunities present itself, shoot jumpers, and shoot poor FTs he is just a big man who needs to operate in paint who can handle the ball. To me if he is not going to be aggressive in seeking to score he needs to be in situations similar to Draymond Green in 2014-2016 team where he surrounded by 2 great shooters to provide space and player movements carrying offense load from perimeter."
"""Joel Embiid, you trash.  Tobias Harris, you trash.  Ben Simmons... Ben Simmons listen to me when I say this: You are trash"""
Joel Embiid looks like a fish outta water and you boys are whining about free throws? Lmao cmon son.
We would never be in a position to win without Joel. Ben being shit at shooting is something that is consistent. No Philly fan is going to shit on Embiid as much as you idiots here want them to.
PG - Tobias Harris  SG - Ben Simmons  SF - Joel Embiid  PF - Seth Curry  C - Furkan Korkmaz   Checks out to me.
yes his name is joel embiid
"I mean if they fully committed to Ben Simmons, they would have played him at Center, and put 4 wings/guards aka shooters/ball-handlers around him. He obviously can't operate in the halfcourt, but the only time they've ever had a team that complemented Simmons was during the stretch to end his rookie season when Embiid was hurt and they had guys like Bellinelli, Redick, Covington, Ilyasova, etc.   Instead, this is Joel Embiid's team because he is the better player of the two, however, a team built like they are is not committing to Ben Simmons.

Joel Embiid plays for the 76ers
Were the 76ers winning at the time? Lol.   I also said this in a sea of Joel hate so I'd say a lot of my upvotes are from Embiid fans.
He’s literally been the same player for 4 years (if not regressed) and the fit with Embiid is terrible. Should’ve S&amp;Td because I can’t see why Joel would wanna stick around to watch homeboy go 5-20 from FT next time
"I don’t think you can build a championship if your best player is Joel Embiid and your second best player is not an elite perimeter scorer.  This is not a shit on Embiid post, it is pointing out if you are banking on a center to do the things the lebron, KD, Kawhi types do, you will be disappointed."
You are a goddamn idiot if you think you can't build around Joel Embiid.
Aron Baynes is not Joel Embiid by any stretch of any imagination.
"Magic (on phone): “Hi Joel Embiid, this is Magic Johnson. I just wanted to let you know that you played badly. That isn’t good to do in the playoffs. You will lose if you do that. Have a good day.”"
[What do you think of Joel Embiid?](https://youtu.be/I7zYRquSfKM?t=12)
"curry’s good but you just can’t expect him to be THAT good every night. there’s just some guys out like shake, even matisse that don’t look completely comfortable at times.   my wife asked me who i’m rooting for and all i could say was “well, the hawks…and joel embiid.” he’s so fun to watch."
Maybe Joel Embiid can tell them to shut the fuck up too
Yooo wtf was that. Joel ben Simmons embiid
"I find it interesting zion gets so much shit for his weight, but his late game performance is fabulous  Meanwhile joel Embiid can barely walk in the fourth quarter"
"Joel ""Ben Simmons"" Embiid free throw"
my advice to Joel Embiid as he deals with a difficult knee injury - a good way to avoid stress on your ligaments is to avoid hurling yourself to the ground any time an opposing player comes near you! Just a thought
Paul George has had his title for worst playoff choker usurped by Joel Embiid and the 76ers.
"Joel Embiid: ""Trae Young is the best player in the world"""
"Hello Philly fans. We need to talk. Remember your attitude last night? What have we even done to you? You were clowning Giannis more than any other fanbase even though he had a good game, right after Joel went 0/12 in the 2nd half and lost his last game. THE AUDACITY.  And now this. You need to apologize or we'll start shitposting, asking if Capela is better than Embiid etc. Go ahead, I want 10 ""I'm sorry"" comments with a Sixers flair."
Has anyone made the Joel “Ben Simmons” Embiid in here yet
when joel embiid beat his chest down 20 after an and 1 i clowned him for having a shit mentality. and here he costs the sixers two games in a row. soft ass player. no mental strength LMFAO
Choking choker Joel Embiid to LA for NBA champion Kyle Kuzma. Who says no?

Joel Embiid is dog water in the clutch
Doc is gonna draw a play for Tobi or Embiid. Either Tobi takes a contested mid range or Joel goes foul hunting.
I agree with the no call… If anything it should be an offensive foul on Trae for violently running over Joel embiid
"Joel ""no-knees"" Embiid"
Imagine if the 76ers had other players on offense besides Seth Curry and Joel Embiid
"Capela plays in front of him and is usually a monster against centers not named Joel Embiid. He led the league in rebounding, top five blocks, and 6th in dpoty voting this year   Onyeka started his rookie season late w a foot injury and took a while to start learning the nba game. He’s got sick potential though, last game of the season we sat Capela and it was really fun watching Okongwu just murder the Rockets (granted it was the Rockets lol)"
"Joel Embiid is masking a lot of Ben Simmons’s shortcomings, especially on offense."
"Joel ""PatBev"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid is just an absolute beast. Overtakes Iverson now as best sixer I’ve watched in my lifetime I think
Curry throws an elbow to Bogi’s nose and it’s a foul on Bogi??? Embiid dives into Collin’s knee and it’s a common foul??? Hawks oughta start sending bench players to dive into *his* knee. Dangerous game to play when you’re barely walking Joel.
joel embiid may average more falls per game than AD lmao
And Joel Embiid.
"The difference between Joel Embiid and every other high level scorer in the NBA is not only is he capable of scoring 24 in a half, but he can be the defensive anchor on the other end and hold the other team to 40 points total in the first half. Ten in the paint.   Best two-way player in the world."
"I saw the quote as clint saying embiid got worn out, which was true last game but yeah lol joel feasting bad tn. Its nuts how good capela is against normal centers versus this. embiid just a freak"

Guys I think Joel Embiid might be better than Clint Capela. Just found out in this game thread
"Why yes, I *have* been having dark, dirty fantasies about what Joel Embiid will do if he goes up against Blake Griffin playing the 5, why do you ask?"
This is the Joel Embiid I know. Performance like this is why that guy is my favorite player.
Joel Embiid is looking to bounce back after a poor second half in game 4 and he has not disappointed.
there is no one that can guard Joel Embiid in the history of the universe
I love it when Joel Embiid remembers who the fuck he is
"“We were making his job tougher contesting everything,"" Capela said after the game in regards to Embiid. ""Making him work. Whenever you wear him out, everything becomes tougher for him. That’s how I knew it was a long series and when the fatigue comes in. . . It’s a different ballgame.  [Article with the quote](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/hawks-clint-capela-sixers-joel-embiid-figured-out)  Basically it’s weird to act like he’s “figured out” Embiid after one bad half (game 4), when Embiid has an injured knee and previously dropped 40 on his head."
Trae Young and Joel Embiid hospital duel. First one to avoid IV at halftime wins
"Kawhi and Kyrie suffered in-game injuries. So did Lebron, who wasn't load-managing (i.e. not worried about over-use) prior to his injury. Harden has a bad hamstring - he came into training camp in poor shape, part of trying to force a trade. Is anyone really surprised that this is lingering on for him?  You call me dense, but what exactly is your argument here?  NBA basketball comes with the risk of leg injuries. Kyrie came down on Giannis' foot and rolled his ankle. The same thing that happened to Donovan Mitchell. The same thing that happened to Ja Morant in the 2nd game of the season.  Kawhi bumped knees with Joe Ingles. Joel Embiid landed awkwardly.   These are natural basketball injuries. You cannot blame the schedule for them.  Yes, Jamal Murray hurt his ACL on a non-contact play, and AD seemed to have an over-use injury. They are two of the more injury-prone players in the league. I don't really think you should point to those two and say ""SEE, WE KNEW IT!"""
I'm hoping Embiid is motivated by not making 1st team All-NBA (I understand why) and Capella's comments after game 4. I want to see angry Joel tonight.
" Giannis just didn’t grow up playing enough basketball and it shows. Some will say but what about Joel Embiid who also played basketball late? But Embiid consciously modeled his game after Hakeem. In this series there’s a visible skill and basketball difference between Giannis and others like  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday. Giannis is truly a rim attacker, utilizing every bit of his physical gifts and strength. However he lacks that fluidity and handle to constantly create his own shot. He’s also not big enough ala prime Shaq to dominate a packed paint. So the shots defenses give him are the 3 point shot and 1 vs 1 mid range and those just aren’t his strengths. His free throws are atrocious too. I really hope Giannis can develop that outside stroke and dribbling. Lebron didn’t have much of a shot but he ended up doing shit like Lebronto.. hopefully Giannis can too"
"Say what you will about wiseman but the dude has serious flashes of talent. Incredible acrobatic layups that shows that he still has an all-nba ceiling. Well above your Hasheem Thabeets, Anthony Bennets, Kwame Browns.   &amp;#x200B;  He goes from straight from dunking on 6'5 teenagers to getting dunked on by Joel Embiid, playing in perhaps the most cognitively challenging offense in the NBA and being expected to play major minutes for a playoff team. you'd expect him to have some major trouble. The game is just too fast for him right now. Jordan poole was dogshit his rookie year and now he's playing closing minutes. When it's been another year I can pass judgement but right now? He's slightly behind schedule, destination unknown.  &amp;#x200B;  Just a side note, onyeka okongwu is currently playing 10 minutes a night for the Hawks. 3.8 points. Why aren't we calling him a bust already? 6th overall pick. If you gave wiseman 10 minutes a night and took all the pressure off of him in a simplified, heliocentric trae offense instead of making reads and playing with steph (while it can lead to incredible basketball, using steph's gravity is really fucking tough), he'd be doing just as well if not better."
"""  That they may end up in first essentially means his team is really good apart from him.  ""  As I said before, the Sixers are 0.500 without him. 9-9.   Every game above .500 is due to Joel Embiid.    Did you see in the discussion where they said  ""Unless it’s the performer without whom his team would fall the most in the standings, as determined by, uh, our imaginations."" ?  Well here we don't need to rely on imagination.  We have empirical data on the splits.  As for the rest of the discussion, no they they didn't all use the word consistency, and it's clear from the discussion that there are many different ways someone can be MVP worthy.  They also talk about defense and consistent BRILLIANCE, not the guy who played the most games:  ""Someone who can combine elite-level proficiency on both ends of the floor, who impacts the game in all facets and does it on a consistently brilliant basis while also lifting his tam up to the next level (or two or three), always resonates. """
"Give me one example of a player in the league today who has a similar play style to Karl Malone that is all star caliber. Giannis? No he’s faster, more athletic, better defensively, and a better passer.  Embiid? Joel is much better defensively and can get out to the 3 point line as well. Part of the reason his post ups are effective are because he’s a threat from anywhere.  Julius Randle? Can shoot the three and is also a better passer  Sabonis? Nope, can stretch the floor to shoot the 3... also a better passer  The dudes who are comparable are the Greg Monroe’s and Enes Kanter’s of the world, although Malone was better defensively than both of them.   I’m not saying these guys are better than Malone, because they aren’t, but he’s just not a good enough shooter or passer to be as valuable in today’s game as he was back in his day. It’s a pace and space league and he’s grit and grind. Not to mention that the game has changed in a way that his best asset, his strength, would depreciate."
Joel Embiid in shambles

"The first thing I would recommend is looking at the standings:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/standings](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings)  This will give you a good idea of the ""exciting teams"".  Next, i would check the National TV schedule for games with these top teams as they are typically going to be the most exciting games:  [https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule](https://www.espn.com/nba/schedule)  I would recommend watching the Philadelphia 76ers vs Dallas Mavericks game that is on ESPN on Monday April 12th.     These are two teams hoping to compete for a title this year. They also have two of the MVP candidates :       Joel Embiid (76ers) - he is the 7' center for PHI. In the past, centers were usually just big guys who would be there to lay in easy shots near the basket. Embiid is a good representation of the way the league is headed. He can shoot 3pointers, he can handle the ball well (most centers cant/wont). Hes all around a fun, exciting player to watch.       Luka Doncic (Mavericks) - Luka is one of the youngest stars in the NBA. He has been compared to LeBron James by some people (who is considered a Top 3 player all time).  \---       I would just watch the majority of this game keeping your eye on these two players. I would listen to the announcers who are sometimes pretty good at giving extra details you may not have noticed (like why something was a good or bad shot, etc.).       Most of all, watch the body language of both teams. See if one team looks bored or if one team seems to be having a ton of fun. Honestly nomentum is one of the core parts of NBA basketball in my opinion.            \---  After watching that, id recommend taking a look at this years All Star teams:  https://www.nba.com/2021-all-star-roster  Familairizing yourself with the big names in the league makes the games a lot more fun and easy to get into.  While you can definitely appreciate games between ""bad teams"" without stars, i think its a lot tougher for new fans to get into because theres not the same ""energy"" and excitement that star players bring"
Hey Joel Embiid didn't touch a basketball until he was 15
"I never said zion was a stretch 5...I said he was a front facing big, who also shoots 37% on three while averaging .6 a game (not .2,) I also said what's the point of including him if his team sucks, you are just pushing goal posts because you cant understand the basic argument that back facing post first players are a dying role, compared to the 80, 90s and 00s where it was one of the most important roles in the league.   Also here embiids shot chart because it seems like you are too lazy to look up evidence that refutes your (unsourced) claims.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-shot-chart-by-season  Thatd right, all his most efficient shots are in the mid range or actually the 3. Of course he is ALSO an elite finisher at the rim, due to his front facing style forcing opponents to play closer to him in the mid range"

"Why are you on about watching the game then just quoting FTA stats like I can’t get that shit from a BBref page?  Yeah, refs miss a lot of calls on Jokic. They miss a lot of calls on everyone. Jokic probably gets it worse than most but this incessant crying like two guys with wildly differing play styles should be getting anything resembling the same number of FTs is ridiculous. Do you also wonder why Tim Duncan never shot as many FTs as Giannis does? Why Kyrie Irving doesn’t get FTs like Harden?  A man whose game is built around a) backing people down from the high post and b) playmaking is not going to get to the line anywhere near as often as somebody who plays in the low post and face up, because they’re not in a position to be fouled while shooting in the first place. “Watching games” ^TM will tell you exactly why he’s nothing like Embiid at all when you wipe away your teary eyes and spend more time with your eyeballs on the screen watching your own team than searching up Joel Embiid’s FT rate."
"Yup. Same with those unwritten rookie rules like rookie ""shouldn't"" be an All-Star because he'll have his time, or that rookies don't get as much calls on fouls because they're rookies (Say Hi to A1 from Day 1). Or situations when someone bigger, stronger can get mauled and have through the whole game only 5 FTA, yet smaller guards like Trae or Lillard get touched on the perimeter and it's 3 free throws attempts.      The truth is that NBA is mainly a business, so they don't care that much about rules or staff like this. Take for example post-players. It's not that it suddenly became a worse offensive option. It's that most of younger players don't have the skillset to play back to basket and even when they do and have size advantage, they are getting called for offensive fouls while trying to secure the ball. This shit is crazy, that a player was learning things from older, great players and now this play is kind of illegal. That's why post-ups are nearly dead, because you can't go in unless you're Joel Embiid, but still he makes many fade-aways to counter this. The amount of plays where a big guy tries to use his size for advantage and is penalized for that is astounding..."
its incredibly ironic that someone played less games than joel and won a tightly contested race over him.  If Embiid won mvp over jokic this year people would lose their minds and never stop mentioning games missed.
"One specific type of play, the post up, is not the only way you can bang in the post.  And honestly that link just proves the point further, in this one specific type of play in the paint Embiid gets shooting fouls more than twice as often(21.6% to 10.5%) on basically identical possessions.  If your argument is that Joel gets more FTs because he bangs in the post, then posting the stats showing that the two players have nearly identical post ups and wildly different FT% on them really kills your point.    How about other post plays though?  Lets look at putbacks: Jokic has 3x Embiids putback field goal attempts (100 to 37), yet only 60 more pts because he gets FTs on putbacks at only 8%, compared to 33% for Embiid.  You gonna try to tell me that Embiid just bangs harder on putbacks too now right?  Embiid has literally twice the shooting fouls on putbacks as Joker, with 63 fewer shots."
"Uh, it's not clear, Embiid is much better on defense, but Jokic is much better on defense. The advanced metric lean Jokic's way, I believe by a fair margin. At the very least, it's not to the point where Embiid being better is factual, Joel is at best arguably better.  And the shooting disparity is big but not huge, I just don't know how you ever thought Joel was a better shooter..."
"Jokic has drawn 287 fouls in 51 games. For those that don't do math, that 5.6 fouls/game. For comparison, Joel Embiid has drawn 263 in 33 games, or 7.9 fouls/game. OP didn't include that context because they knew it detracted from their point.  Jokic has drawn 7.9 fouls per 100 posessions which is 8th most in the league, but on par with a player like KAT(7.9). For comparison, other physical players like Giannis or Joel Embiid, that number is up at 11+. More context OP omitted because they know it detracts from their point.  &gt;Jokic leads the league non-shooting fouls drawn per 100 possessions.  Cool. Call shooting fouls.  &gt;When Jokic draws shooting fouls, he gets fewer free throws out of them. Jokic converts a higher percentage of his shooting fouls into and-1  That has nothing to do with number of shooting fouls called, but OP hoped you wouldn't question their methods.  &gt;Jokic doesn't shoot tech free throws. It's a small difference, but it's there  Self-admitted, small difference.  Figures can't lie, but liars can figure."
"Not watching the game, what the fuck caused this FT disparity for anyone watching? I know Jimmy gets to the line a lot but 18 in 1 Q? That’s some Joel Embiid levels of ridiculous"
You’re taking Bam over Joel Embiid? Really? Joel Embiid is a complete freak. He’s basically unguardable.
"Because he’s Joel Embiid. If he wants to take the free throw, nobody’s gonna stop him. Also he’s an 85% free throw shooter."
"The rankings:   **DPOY:**  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Bam Adebayo  **MVP:**   1. Nikola Jokic 2. Damian Lillard 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Joel Embiid 5.

Christian Wood  **Coach of the year:**  1. Monty Williams 2. Quin Snyder 3. Mike Malone  If there's any specific questions about a ranking or omission, I can add that in the comments."
Jokic shoots from in the paint more often per game and at a higher percentage than Embiid.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/nikola-jokic-shot-chart  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=joel+embiid+shot+chart+2020-2021
"Yeah yeah Embiid is so hard to stop, that’s why he’s worse at scoring than Jokic from every distance. Have you never watched a nuggets game or are you just illiterate? If assists and FTs have such a strong inverse correlation, why are Harden, Doncic and Trae at the top of the leaderboards for both? They have almost no relationship, absolutely braindead take.    Nobody said he should be getting more FTs than Embiid. Just that the gap is inflated because they’re officiated at a different standard. Obviously Embiid is going to have more because he’s a flop-first player, but the current 12 vs 4.5 split is heavily skewed relative to how much they’re actually fouled.    Joel is elite in exactly two areas: exaggerating contact and getting injured. And there isn’t even evidence he’s stronger than Jokic, they’re about the same size and he’s shooting 9/29 against him in his career. Wouldn’t be surprised if Jokic is just as strong or stronger, he just doesn’t move as violently."
"Jokic takes a higher percentage of his shots within 10ft than Embiid does and averages more paint touches per game. He attempts 6.6 FG/game within 5ft of the basket and 4.1 from 5-9ft. Embiid attempts 5.3 FG/game within 5ft of the basket and just 2.8 from 5-9ft. Jokic has a higher FG% from both distances even at higher volume.    Those are the plays where most of the uncalled fouls are, and they’re shots he’s already taking. If it was about where he was positioned on the court, then he wouldn’t be taking more shots close to the basket than Embiid is. He’s already taking the ball to the hoop a ton, you’re acting like he just sits at the top of the arc and distributes the whole game which he simply doesn’t. When he moves to score he backs up to the basket, he takes a lower % of long 2s than Joel does. I’m not creating plays out of thin air, you clearly just don’t understand how Jokic plays and what his shot distribution looks like. These are shots he’s **ALREADY TAKING** and is fouled on, but it isn’t called, and they’re just recorded as missed shots. That has absolutely nothing to do with his assist volume."
Because that's only one part of his game and his overall efficiency is not as remarkable by comparison to some other players who also have large offensive roles.  Some examples:  Nikola Jokic: 26.3/10.9/8.7 on 64.7 TS%  Zion Williamson: 26.3/7.0/3.5 on 66.0 TS%  Steph Curry: 29.7/5.5/6.0 on 64.6 TS%  Joel Embiid: 29.9/11.2/3.2 on 64.7 TS%  Giannis: 28.8/11.4/6.2 on 63.1 TS%
"Tbh Joel Embiid’s first game, against OKC. I started getting more into basketball after hearing about The Process, and Embiid was more myth than man at that point. Truly an incredible feeling to go from Bigfoot videos of him jogging through the streets at night, and rumors of Hinkie telling someone at a bar “Joel Embiid is the real fucking deal.” to see him hitting that first turnaround J and blocking Westbrook at the rim."
Nets can't win. We have Joel Embiid and superstar Daniel Green
"Gobert hasn’t played in most games, he’s played in EVERY single game this season. Embiid has missed 18 games so far and will miss 4 more if he sits out back-to-backs. Not saying it should be Gobert, but he has a solid argument. The difference between the Jazz or the Sixers having the best record is Joel missing games and Gobert not missing games."
"That’s a fair argument but having watched them, Joel and Jokic defiantly do receive very different whistles on the same types of contact, even if Embiid does certain things differently. I’ve seen Jokic initiate contact like Embiid does many times in the paint but I’ve never seen him get the whistle for it, whereas Joel often gets it for really light, almost incidental contact that he initiates while driving."
"I think you could put Embiid at the '4', and basically just make him the weakside defender. Make Jokic hedge even harder on the PnR, and just direct them to Joel."
"Yes. I said Joel Embiid stays hurt so Sixers fans have a permanent excuse and I got banned from r/Sixers (and from r/Nuggets for two days btw, which is BS IMO but w/e). That is not an excuse for making light of a massacre, you dumbass."
"There's only one guy in the NBA statistically who actually can hang single teaming him anymore I think - Jokic. I'm not saying that ironically. The 6ers and Nuggets have played 11 times in their careers, Embiid has been healthy for 5 of them. SSS but Jokic has statistically gotten the better of him (slightly) and limited his effectiveness. Marc Gasol has probably aged out of that, as has Horford, and Dwight is on the same team as Joel. Those are the 3 other guys I think could really do it."
"Sorry, what do you disagree with?  Ben Simmons benefits tremendously from having an elite rim protector behind him.  Rim protection is still the most valuable part of defense. Embiid is an elite rim protector. Therefore Embiid is the most valuable defender on the team. The 76ers have other solid perimeter defenders but have nobody else who can do what Joel does.  Tobias Harris is incredibly underrated, he's playing at nearly an all NBA level.  Ben Simmons is tremendously overrated. He does one thing at an elite level and even then he has the backing of another player who is even better than he is. I'm not saying he's a certified bum, he's definitely a starter level player in the NBA but lets stop acting like any team with Ben Simmons leading the way would ever get out of the first round.  Did I tell a single lie? Instead of attacking me as a person, try actually watching the games. BTW; if you haven't been watching the NHL this year you should give it a chance, pretty entertaining product with much less red-ball."
"I respectfully disagree. While Ben Simmons is taking the toughest defensive matchups, he's sheltered by the elite rim protection of Embiid. Joel is the best defender on that team and Ben Simmons contributions everywhere else are so extremely limited. I think Tobias and Ben Simmons are the most underrated and overrated players in the league respectively."
"I mean Joel Embiid didn't even play tonight for the Hawks, what could they do?"
I’ve been stacking rookie cards of this kid cuz I think he’s gonna be a highlight reel until he injures Himself trying to dunk on Ben Simmons and Joel embiid
"I’m confused a bit by thus message. It’s not parallel here, and you’re misreading my tone. I’m not being defensive - its a serious fact that this thread is the postgame thread for Sixers-Celtics and there’s even a big discussion about Jokics free throws here. This is what I’m saying. It’s not even. Sixers fans aren’t all over Denver game threads talking about Embiid. Denver fans are all over here. And yeah, it’s colored by previous interactions by other fans, because the original complaint is about the behavior of Denver fans. That’s not really a groundbreaking point, it’s just the entire origin of what we’re talking about. “Yeah both sides are annoyed” is really not the case, when Embiids free throws aren’t brought up by Sixers fans in discussion places by Denver fans, they’re brought up by Denver fans there. Every post about Joel embiid that includes the words free throws has this conversation in it, and it’s really not relevant to what Sixers fans want to talk about in things like our own post game threads."
"&gt; What's the argument here? Just defense? Gobert is a minimal offensive threat that barely creates his own points. He's scoring 15ppg and happens to have the best shooting team in the league around him which helps a ridiculous amount with having free points near the basket.  Best defender in the league right now, by a wide margin.  I don't think too many people disagree with that, so that's all I'll say about that.  As far as offense, yeah he's pretty offensively limited and doesn't create his own points, but he DOES create points for the rest of the team.  He's an elite roll man which really helps our shooters get shots.  His gravity lures defenders into the paint, which leaves our shooters wide open.  People think he just stands there and waits for lobs, but he's extremely important to our offense.  Utah wouldn't be the 3 point shooting team it is without Gobert's gravity on the inside.  And of course, we can't forget that he leads the league in screen assists.  People get unreasonably mad at screen assists for some reason, though.    &gt; He's a perennial DPOY candidate, but got 40 dropped on him by Embiid, 35 then 47 dropped on him by Jokic, which I goes more to show that man-on-man the advantage goes to post scorers. Gobert is a game changer overall by anchoring the entire defense for sure, but I think top 10 requires way more than that.  I mean, if you just look at a box score, yeah, but when it was actually Gobert defending Embiid that game, Gobert did well.  According to [this article in the Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/joel-embiid-scared-76ers-rudy-gobert-20210304.html), over the last two seasons, Embiid has shot 19-for-48 (39.5%) with Gobert on the floor, and 12-for-35 (34.2%) when Gobert was the closest defender.  As for Jokic, he's just the MVP, lmao.  He's just straight up a bad matchup for Gobert, lmao.  No one else out there quite like him.  But yeah, a lot of advanced stats really like Gobert as well, such as NBA.com having him as the #1 among all starters in Net Rating, and [538's RAPTOR](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) having nothing but good things to say about him.    He's the best player on the best team in the league right now.  I don't think a team does as well as Utah is doing without at least one player in the top 10.  In a thread about hot takes, I figured this opinion was warranted."

It's weird.
"KAT when healthy, is better than Joel Embiid but him being on the Wolves makes it hard for people to realize."
"I think it would be closer than people realize, when he wants to score he is completely unstoppable in the paint. I remember him easily backing down prime DeAndre Jordan when he was like 21, and last night he was throwing around Jerami Grant like a ragdoll. He’s a lot stronger than people realize, I mean over the past 4 years Embiid is only shooting 9/29 (30%) against him per NBA tracking, largely because he’s one of the only guys strong enough that Joel can’t just push him around like Gobert or something."
"But Embiid is *factually* easier to stop on plays where he isn’t fouled (see FG% at every distance but 16ft-3pt), so that doesn’t add up. I’m not saying Jokic should be getting more calls than Joel, only that it should be closer, like 10 vs 8 (same as Jimmy Butler), not 12 vs 4.5 like it is now. And that if it were closer, the gap in “stopability” that already exists between them would only widen in Jokic’s favor. He’s already a considerably more impactful offensive player even with the foul discrepancy.     By equivalent whistles I mean equal definitions of what constitutes a foul, not an equal number of calls."
"Jokic actually attempts a higher % of his shots within 10ft than Embiid does. People act like Jokic and Embiid have super different play styles, but they really don’t when scoring. Their offensive shot distribution and style is more similar than almost any other pairing of players in the league, they’re both top 3 in post ups, and they have similar shooting splits.   FGA distribution by distance:  0-3ft: Embiid 21%, Jokic 24%  3-10ft: E 24% J 35%  10-16ft: E 24% J 15%  16-3pt: E 14% J 9%  3pt: E 17% J 19%  Jokic is one of the most physical and highest volume post players in the league. The biggest difference is that Embiid gets calls for running right into defenders and flailing his arms while Jokic prioritizes making shots over getting whistles. His problem is similar to that of LeBron and Kawhi (who also have very low FT rates relative to their FG% in the post)- he’s so strong that he barely flinches even when defenders make hard contact, but because he often doesn’t get the whistle even on clear fouls, his priority is to make the basket instead of selling the contact. You have to be really confident you’re going to get the call to cut into your chance of making the shot as much as Embiid often does (including just throwing the ball up in the air), and Jokic has good reason not to, so he plays through contact.    Typical Embiid play: https://m.imgur.com/a/CpYlLs1  Typical Jokic non-call: https://streamable.com/d42rck  Idk how you can watch them play and say Jokic isn’t physical lol, he goes straight at the hoop and actually fights through contact instead of jumping and flailing like Joel. Jokic is also just as strong as Embiid (or at least close), and stronger than almost everyone in the league if we’re. He’s just not as violent with his movements, but the pure strength is there."
"That also means that Jokic’s “real foul adjusted” FG% in the paint would be WAY higher than Embiid’s, since that a lot of Joel’s misses are wiped off with whistles (often weak whistles), and many of Jokic’s close misses are uncalled fouls. So, given that Jokic is already a better shooter than Joel in the paint and restricted area even with the call differential, the gap would be huge if they got equivalent whistles. So the idea that Embiid is “unstoppable” and Jokic isn’t is bs, Jokic is literally harder to stop"
Ben Simmons is a horrible fit with many superstars because he cannot do much of anything in the halfcourt offense. That is debilitating especially in the postseason. Ben Simmons best role would be like draymond. Slot him in as a pf next to a dame lillard or Steph curry. Meanwhile Trae young can pair up with any sg/sf/pf/c and it’s no issue. In fact he’s likely gonna make all those guys lives easier cause of his playmaking. Ben Simmons paired up with a big man like say Joel embiid is a big issue because ben Simmons has to hide in the dunkers spot whenever the game slows down cause he is useless on the perimeter. It is painful to watch that and see embiid have to post up against a guy and have another guy ready to help cause ben is so close to the rim. You are sleeping on how limited ben is in the playoffs.
"I only say the highlights of this one, but imagine having to go to war against Joel Embiid with...Luke Kornet and Tacko Fall."
"Criticism from a philly flair..  I love the regular season. Those who know (fans of contenders) are vastly outnumbered by those who don't (fans of pretenders)  You guys are like a zombie horde that just keep coming. It's not until playoffs when you get exposed do the herds thin out a bit.  Enjoy. Downvote me. Those who think Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are going to lead the Sixers over a Nets team with championship pedigree keep upvoting this guy. I'm doing a public service for you guys, keep smoking that hopium.  Just don't bet any money on the Sixers"
"The reason the Sixers are still a top seed is because the team was clearly still playoff caliber without Joel, that has literally nothing to do with Embiid"
"I for one want a game where Joel has zero free throws.   Just allow your average 2021 ""center"" to guard Embiid one on one. No help, no doubles, no fouling, just play as hard as you can and if he puts you under the rim or goes by you just let him have that one and try again next time. Don't try to get your hands on the ball when he's facing up either. Just let him comfortably take that mid range shot whenever he wants to take a break from murdering your center in the post.   Some brave coach should try this for one game. No help defense. Let's see if he scores more or fewer points."
"Joel Embiid gonna average more than 30 in the playoffs for sure, sixers championship run is going to be dependent on if Tobias Harris can perform like he has recently in the playoffs and how efficient Simmons is."
"This a terrible argument. If embiid was as good as a facilitator as jokic teams wouldn't collapse on him as much. Jokic vision and passing ability make it hard for defenses to leave their assignment without being punished immediately. Idk why you think joker would suffer if teams literally left their assignment and doubled him. He would eat that shit up all day. Dude is already averaging more assists than most guards. The reason teams double embiid is bc it's their best chance against him. The reason teams don't double jokic is bc it's their best chance against them. Not many are saying joel deserves less and joker deserves more. Not many are saying joker even deserves as many as embiid. Most are just saying he deserves more in general.   It's their style that creates the difference in fta. And not as much playstyle as it is how they handle being fouled. A ref will be more inclined to call a foul when a player falls, yells, embellishes a little (embiid type) vs a player who runs back up court, doesn't fall, or commits a dumb foul on the transition to talk with the ref (joker).   A ref sometimes won't call a foul if it doesn't impede the play. Every time Joel embiid is fouled he makes it a point to show that. Joker does not. If joker wants more calls he knows what he needs to do. He's just not willing to sacrifice his style."
"Why is it [annoying to point out factually true things?](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/tracking-post-ups/?sort=POST_TOUCHES&amp;dir=1). Jokic is third in post-ups lol. He leads in post touches. Yes, there’s a bit of a difference in that he passes out of the post more than Joel, but he still bangs in the post plenty - he’s third in the league!  So the thing that’s annoying for **us** is this constant narrative like the one in your post that claims he’s all finesse and doesn’t play any bully ball at all. The dude is big and strong! He bangs down low plenty! Just because embiid does it more doesn’t mean Jokic doesn’t do it at all.  I doubt you’ll find anyone who says Jokic deserves just as many FTs as embiid. But he currently gets 2.5 times fewer, which is an insane disparity given their play styles. It’s not like Jokic is Steph curry out in the perimeter shooting jump shots all day. He’s in the paint getting elbows and forearms to the face, scratches all over his triceps, shots to the gut etc.  I think you probably don’t watch as much Jokic play as you think you do. And that’s...Fine. Not everyone has time to watch everyone in the league. But it’s frustrating to hear people talk so...**definitively** about Jokic’s game when they clearly don’t watch him that often and are just repeating narratives about him."

"On an unrelated note to this post, I was just looking at your schedule this season, because we play y'all after the Rockets, and I haven't been too impressed. Y'all have beaten the somewhat bad teams and lost to a lot of the contenders. Imo, this is (a smaller) part of why Giannis isn't talked about as a top 3 MVP candidate this year by national media. This isn't shade btw but just an observation.   Y'all beat the 76ers without Joel Embiid and it took overtime to do it. It was a really great comeback but for a contender that raises concern. Great win over the Clippers by 5 in February but the rest is seemingly unimpressive. I'm curious to see how y'all fair in the playoffs. Personally, I think y'all are past being upset in the playoffs but as it currently stands, a Bucks-Heat first round matchup would be really interesting."

"The thing that’s annoying, and a negative contribution to discussion, is this notion that “Jokic bangs in the post just as much.” “Jokic is just as physical of a center.” Etc. The reason why it’s annoying is because Joel and Nikola have distinctly different play styles and the way embiid forces a defender into a foul through his dexterity and footwork leading to an unguardable position where a foul is necessary to prevent a bucket is an elite skill, and the notion that Jokic does that just as well minimizes Joel’s play style, but if anyone dared to suggest that Joel can do any of the unique things that Jokic does it would be met with derision that he could pass out of the post and create looks. (He can’t, not nearly at Jokic levels.) Joel has a very interesting and unique skill in the way he not only draws fouls but forces fouls, and that’s why he’s so good at getting them. Certainly Jokic deserves more free throws. That’s not Joel’s fault."
Embiid has simmons who is a black hole on offense and constantly forces 3 guys in the paint fouling joel... we have seen this year where 4 guys were defending joel lol... now imagine if joel had murray and the nuggets had ben simmons???????????? jokic would retire.
he cant be a point of comparison because he isnt anywhere near as physical.. Jokics point of comparison would be AD... Embiid lives in the paint and even though people think he shoots to many 3s plays small he has led the league last year etc at paint points... Joel is banging every game most of the game and that isnt jokic. Does jokic deserve more calls probably but using a guy that is the best player in the sport in the paint as a point of reference isnt smart.
"One reason for the discrepancy that isn't talked about enough is that teams send doubles way more often at Embiid. Of you don't double Embiid he will score on you pretty easily in the post. Meanwhile if you send a double at Jokic it's an assist waiting to happen. Joel makes the right pass and starts the chain, Jokic literally will just pass to the guy who is now streaking to the rim or wide open.   Doubles obviously lead to more fouls."
"Greg Oden, Yao Ming, Joel Embiid might disagree"
Joel Hans Embiid would never
"I'm saying its Jokic vs the refs, not Jokic vs Embiid. And Denver fans keep bitching about Joel when it has nothing to do with him, which is annoying"
"Embiid for MVP is back on the table, people!   Joel will have a serious case for it if he tears up the league ROS and Philly remains as a top seed in the East."
Dumb take bro. For whatever reason (I think its strength) Kanter does well against Joel. He also goes back at him on offense (not always successful) and hits the offensive boards so Embiid maybe has to work a bit harder than normal.
No order:  Allen Iverson  Joel Embiid  Jason Williams  Tracy McGrady  Damian Lillard  Brandon Roy  Chris Webber  HAKEEM  Shawn Kemp  Gary Payton
"Refs on Joel Embiid: “Walking to the line, he said, ‘I’m back.’ And I said ‘yeah I noticed’”"

Counter counterpoint: Joel Embiid
"Three finals in four years during a rebuild, better than loosing on purpose to rebuild and doing jack but ""jOeL eMbiId iS mVP"" so you have that I guess. At least one of your tanking picks worked out."
"The jokic fouls are his own problem. Don’t bring Embiid into this. Have you seen people try and guard him? If you’re 1 on 1 w Embiid this year, it’s just not going to end well for you point blank. Jokic is more finesse and Joel has been great at drawing fouls from the moment he played his first game"
Okay? But that is neither a slight on joel or means that joel should somehow get less fouls  Soke of the videos I've seen in this sub about foul no calls on jokic don't get called on embiid either   Joel gets some ticcy tack calls but will then get hacked and get nothing  Bitch about not getting calls all you want but it's not Joel's fault if anything him getting to the line so much is the bar for calling fouls
well know we know what happens when you start robert williams vs joel embiid
Attempting to defend Joel Embiid must be the most demoralizing thing for an opposing big man
The amount of salty Celtics fans in the game thread was almost as enjoyable was watching Joel Embiid play basketball.
Joel ‘James Harden’ Embiid
literally unreal that someone can make joel embiid look childishly small lmao
That’s the only reason I’m slightly worried about the sixers in the playoffs. Embiid looks like he is ready to be the leader that Jimmy taught him to be. But Harris and Simmons seem like they are the ones to lose focus.  Even worse...Rivers looks like he wouldn’t even help Joel he would also collapse.
Who watched the secret base video about the beef between Marcus Smart and Joel Embiid?
PG- Shephen Curry  SG- Luka  SF-Lebron  PF- Giannis  C- Joel Embiid  6th Man-Jokic  7th- Kawhi  8th- Dame Dolla  9th- KD  10th- Harden
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"Then i'll admit to having his game wrong, because I mostly saw his college and early NBA game as ""Joel Embiid but never figured it out"""
"You are describing Joel Embiid ""good footwork for a big guy"" quick. Not a ""runs the floor like a guard"" scouting report that Wiseman got, or ""dribbles like a guard"" scouting report that AD/KD got."
Joel embiid wrestled a lion in africa
Honestly I get why Joel does it. Big guys never get calls. Embiid finally figured out you need to sell the contact
"Please shut the fuck up. The kid is 20. Sure he’s not Lamelo, but don’t rag on him for being ineffective with only 40 games played and essential 0 college experience. He’s pretty much straight out of highschool. Just cause he’s not prime Joel Embiid doesn’t mean he’s a bust. 0 chance warriors trade their future. Pretty fucking sad how this sub hates on younger players."
That's true he got 42 on the Jazz without Embiid but the sixers lost. He is the most efficient and effective when he plays with Joel and shooters.
"No he does not lmao, he draws fouls more but he doesn’t get to the line from pump fakes. He gets there cause he’s a big man that nobody can guard. This isn’t a rule to combat big men like embiid, if it’s because of any sixer it is Seth curry, he does it more than joel"

Can anyone remind me when Joel Embiid was out with an injury?  Anyone?
That Rudy Gobert was a better center than Joel Embiid.  On offense.

"Did you really think this was a good point? If you swapped Young and Simmons, the Sixers would probably be better LMFAO. If you gave Trae Young a player as good as Joel Embiid and some of the other talent the Sixers have had, the Hawks would've already made the playoffs and this point would be even more ridiculous than it already is."
"I agree man. Like I  get it nuggets fans, he doesn’t get much calls but what’s more likely:   he’s just not as good at foul drawing  or  There is a league wide conspiracy to reduce Jokic FTA so he can average less points and not win MVP because he is a white person (not even kidding you this is what some people on r/Denvernuggets believe)   dude needs to go to a joel embiid foul drawing camp over the off-season"
"I get people want to support their fav player but Jokic does himself no favors on not getting to the FT line, *especially* compared to nuggets fan favorite Joel Embiid.   I’m prepared for the downvotes by the circlejerk but Everyone gets fouled in the paint and the best know how to draw fouls.   I will say that if Jokic has Embiids foul drawing skill he would undeniably be the most unstoppable player in the league."
"Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid"
And Joel Embiid vs whatever poor soul on the Nets is forced to guard him won’t end well for the Nets.   Aldridge? DAJ?
"Even ignoring the so called “tall tales,” wilt was still 7’1 with a 9’9 standing reach who could run a 10.6 100, do a 6’6 high jump, and bench 550. Those are all verifiable facts. It’s like if you gave Joel Embiid 95% of LeBron’s athleticism and 80% of his playmaking ability. Wilt would be a top 2 player in the league today even without a solid 3 pointer and it wouldn’t be particularly close"
"There’s no way Embiid is going to be in the running at the end of the year. Most an MVP has missed is 13% of the season (Iverson 2001) in the past 40 years, and Joel has already missed 25% of the total games this year. That number will only go up as he’ll likely have more off days like today."
"People act like Jokic and Embiid have super different play styles, but they really don’t when scoring.

well joel jumps more in one game than jokic jumps in a season  inb4 jokic plays more games per season than embiid played in career xd
"I’m worried for the playoffs. The regular season no longer matters for the Sixers. Embiid is a MVP caliber player and they can’t wait on Ben Simmons much longer. He is an elite defender and does many things well, but games like today show his biggest flaws. He looks straight up disinterested at times, and even though he’s not a scorer he should not be getting out scored by Mike Scott, Dwight Howard and Paul Reed in a game without Joel. This year’s playoffs will be very interesting."
"At one point in the game, sources said, Lonzo Ball turned to the Big Market GMs and screamed, ""You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me."" Ball left Steph Curry and Joel Embiid largely speechless. He dominated the Rockets in every way. Lonzo is back."
"Joel ""when I touch the ball it's a bucket or a foul"" Embiid"
I literally have no fucking idea. Does it matter if each Steph goes out for 20+ if Joel Embiid drops 100 on your head?
Joel Embiid watches this on repeat while daydreaming he is Jokič.
"I don't know what Sixers fans you've been talking to but more often than not we just hate ourselves. Sometimes we get good and a few of the more vocal idiots get uppity and start talking shit, but then we lose one game and the other 90% of our fanbase goes on r/sixers and starts shitting on the team/doc/mike scott/Ben/Tobias/Furkan/Embiid/Ownership/Mike scott some more, etc.  It's kinda miserable being a Sixers fan really. Joel makes it worth it for me though."
"Jokic and Embiid are both better and more valuable than Kat is, I’m sorry to say. They bring different things to the table at an elite level: Joel with the defense and post scoring and Jokic with the facilitation and playmaking. Towns is an all-time great shooting big and I love the guy but the problem is that that skillet isn’t super well-suited for a center."

"It’s been annoying the hell out of me when people say he’s only gonna be MVP because Embiid is hurt. I get that he’s not as much of a two way player as Joel, but the way he’s carrying the nuggets this season, especially without Murray, is legendary."
Joel Embiid has entered the chat.
"I mean Joel changed his diet, lost weight, and was probably in the best shape of his career. Just a freak accident because of the foul. But yeah any hypotheticals with injury are pretty nonsensical when it comes to both Embiid and Jokic in the mvp race."

"&gt; Switching into guards like Curry, Booker, Kyrie, etc. is still probably a bad idea because those guys are just unreal on the offensive end.  That applies to literally everyone in the league though.  Obviously you don't want him guarding guys like that all game long but he does *shockingly* well in short bursts.

Considering Embiid's talent that's an excellent game from Rudy.

Those games both guys excelled against defenders outside of Rudy.  What I don't get about you guys is instead of giving your guy props for good games you have to shit on the other player. Why not just appreciate that your boys had great games against an elite defender instead of acting like you did it against a scrub. It's a weird look in my opinion.
I am sick of this Embiid commercial. I don't give 2 shits about Joel Embiid.

Nikola 'Joel Embiid' Jokic
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
"wait you mean Grant Williams right? I assume Robert Williams will be starting. if by chance u mean Grant, I don't really see that working out. From what I've seen, he's really not that great of a player. Y'all definitely should try to avoid playing an undersized center rotation for yet another year especially considering you play in the conference with Joel Embiid, Giannis, and Bam all playing on top eastern conference teams... I think you guys need another real big (look how dwight howard has done wonders for the Sixers this year, a backup center that is essentially a starting quality big is extremely important for a successful team IMO). I think you guys should sign someone like Dwight Howard(although, as I Sixers fan, I hope we re-sign him), Javale McGee, Richaun Holmes, or Nerlens Noel"
oh boy imagine if joel embiid made the third team
"According to the Sixers website:  Embiid 7ft (280lb / 127kg) Simmons 6’11 (240lb / 109kg) Harris 6’8 (226lb / 103kg) Green 6’6 (215lb / 98kg) Korkmaz 6’7 (202lb / 92kg)  That is an enormous group of people.   I know reported heights and weights are often wrong, particularly for the biggest and smallest players, but it’s been pretty well confirmed that Simmons is 6’10 / 6’11. If you’ve ever seen Ben stand next to Joel he is at least 2/3 inches taller so he seems more like 7’2 +   Last years Sixers were even bigger, but had a terrible fit. Would also be interested to see the wingspan of the top teams but can’t be bothered to do the research right now."
"no.. the stat needs to be points off of missed 3s, period..... I am not against the 3s as a tool to be used to win basketball games..... I am an old head raised on big men in the post; I got it I'm old school... but I can appreciate the 3 as a weapon...  The over reliance on the 3-ball is just plain stupid and not good basketball in my book...... I think the Sixers winning the title this year will help to put a fork in a lot of ""truisms"" in basketball right now.  They have a generational big man in Joel Embiid... they have generational point guard in Ben Simmons... if they win the title they are going trash a whole lot of the current talk in the NBA..... I can't wait..."
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Embiid, especially if he gets to farm the wizards and nets interior defense. Just depends on how many minutes Joel is physically capable of playing"
"It would have been the exact same thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, there isn't a major schematic difference between Brett and Doc.  The only major changes are on defense with Embiid playing less drop coverage.    The main difference between the Sixers from last year to this year are spacing that Danny Green and Seth Curry provide that Al Horford and Josh Richardson do not.    If anything Butlers lack of consistent 3pt shooting would have led to the problems we had last season and the season prior.  Tobias wouldn't have space and opportunity to post up.  Joel would have very little space to manuever and harder double teams to face.  Ben would still stuck in the dunkers spot."
you can do this with everyone  embiid and simmons together are on a 70 win pace this year but ben missed like 10 games and joel 19  it is hard to take this regular season seriously theres barely any matchups where both teams are healthy
"Rob already is an athletic freak, is the thing. Man has a 40-inch vertical as a center, and his height isn't so much of an issue because he has the same wingspan as Joel Embiid. If anything, I'd be worried that giving him any more athleticism would tear his body apart, he's already so injury-prone.   ...6'6"" Marcus Smart is basically prime Draymond, though, so you might be onto something there."
"Yeah it’s all gonna come down to voter’s philosophy. If it was really about putting the best 5 players then for sure Embiid/Jokic both make it. But in reality there’s no difference in 1st vs 2nd team all-nba (or 3rd really) when it comes to supermax contract implications.  I’d say most voters put Joel at C just so they can put a F like Zion or Randle on 3rd team over having a 4th C like Bam, which is the way I’d go if I was a voter. There’s just way more depth at F than C"
Joel Embiid is my favorite basketball player. I am from Philadelphia and he plays for the local team. He is big and strong and he says funny jokes. I like him and all my friends like him. Go Embiid!

"I'm biased too, so I'm not going to argue with you on the calls.    But, the white people thing is actually something he said.     Here is the quote from Embiid:  ““So I’m chilling one night, and I go on YouTube, and I’m thinking I’m about to figure this shooting thing out.  “I go to the search box like….  “HOW TO SHOOT 3 POINTERS.  “Nah.  “HOW TO SHOOT GOOD FORM  “Nah.  “Then the light bulb went off, man. I typed in the magic words.  “WHITE PEOPLE SHOOTING 3 POINTERS.  “Listen, I know it’s a stereotype, but have you ever seen a normal, 30-year-old white guy shoot a three-pointer? That elbow is tucked, man. The knees are bent. The follow-through is perfect. Always. ...  “Those are the guys I learned from on YouTube. Just random people shooting threes with perfect form. … It was crazy, because getting some range changed my whole game. Teams couldn’t play off me anymore, and I started doing a lot better.”  [Source](https://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-joel-embiid-kobe-20180831-story.html)"
"What? Joel Embiid, Zion.."
Mitch coming back would be huge for the matchup   Ofc Embiid is going to get his points no matter who on the Knicks goes against him but 48 minutes of great post defense between Mitch and Nerlens would make it more of a struggle for Joel
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."

"It's absolutely nothing like saying that. Rose was great 10 years ago, LeBron was inarguably the best player on the planet in October. He has one injury and you people have the memory of a goldfish.  When Joel Embiid got hurt and wasn't playing, was Vucevic now a better player than Embiid?"
Slightly better midrange shooter lmao do you even watch. This is just a joel embiid hate post
"I mean I literally explains above.  Theres a baseline level of rebounding competence expected for 7 footers.  But as long as you meet that level no one cares .  If Joel embiid grabbed 14 boards per game vs 11 per game or whatever , no one cares, but with Westbrook people love to jerk off about his rebounding numbers .    Anyways, my point is for much of Brook lopez career, hes been below that baseline level of competence.   With the Nets he wasn't grabbing enough boards because he was too soft, its that simple"
"Yes. Joel Type Ii diabetes Embiid never rests, on or off the court.  What narrative would you like to try next?"
Joel Embiid was the runner up for Brogdon.....
Joel Embiid cause I'm a sixers fan
"This! They call any touch foul on the perimeter, but you can physically assault a player in the post and they won’t call shit unless your Joel embiid, then refs take turns to make calls for him"
And it produced Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons among other things contributing to the sixers current contention
"My All NBA Team Predictions:  1st Team: G - Stephen Curry G - Luka Doncic F - Giannis Antetokounmpo F - Kawhi Leonard C - Nikola Jokic  2nd Team: G - Damian Lillard G - Chris Paul F - Julius Randle F - Paul George C - Joel Embiid  3rd Team: G - Donovan Mitchell G - Kyrie Irving F - Zion Williamson F - Jayson Tatum C - Rudy Gobert  I think most people agree with the Center positions.   I didn't include Lebron, KD, Harden because KD will only have played 50% of the games (36), Harden only 61% (44/72) or 50 games in a normal season and that's assuming he plays 2 more games, and Lebron only 65.2% (47/72) or 54 games in a normal season assuming he plays the last 4 games.  It was tough picking the guards because Booker, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, and Bradley Beal are getting shafted."

I think that any system where Joel Embiid can decide that he’s award eligible as a guard and only as a guard is a bad system
"Wouldn’t it make sense that a team built around Curry that added KD would function better with the player they’ve drafted and traded around?   If you took Giannis out of the Bucks and slot in James Harden (a player of similar status) wouldn’t the team look at lot worse despite them being players of similar caliber?  Or hell if we really wanna go there, take out Luka from the Mavs and give them Embiid. That team is clearly worse than they’d be with Luka but that doesn’t mean as a player he’s better than Joel.   In the playoffs KD looked like the better player, clearly, in both title runs."
Bucks ain't sleep walking through shit with Joel Embiid still in the conference and Harden coming back
Obvious salient point is not so obvious to the oblivious community who thinks Embiid &gt; CP3 in the MVP race. Jokic I see the argument. JOEL? No way! Doc Rivers is what changed the Sixers...
"Joel ""Ryota Kise"" Embiid"
"Well he's the only guard in the top 20 blocks so I would imagine he counts as a guard in other metrics too, but this is the same league that is saying Joel Embiid also qualifies as a forward in addition to center for all NBA so it's possible things are just as fucked in the case of the all  defensive team"

Seriously tho, even Embiid said that he's trying to get to the playoffs healthy. The guys are just coasting the fuck out of games honestly, as far as they win 3 more and secure the first seed I am okay with this. Fresh Joel and hopefully playoff unlocked Tobias and Ben Simmons are going to be huge for the playoffs and they can warmup in the first round, and then second - we're getting the easy part of the bracket."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
Steph Curry is the Greatest Point Guard of All-Time.  Jokic shouldn't win MVP as he's not having as good of a season as Joel Embiid or Steph Curry.  LeBron is the GOAT (Not much of a hot take but still unpopular)  Luka is a losing player  Wilt Chamberlain is the Greatest Center of All-Time.
Because Joel Embiid is better and people refuse to admit it.
There was a post here the other day about how Embiid was eligible for both spots: https://www.libertyballers.com/2021/5/6/22423255/report-joel-embiid-is-eligible-for-first-team-all-nba-as-a-center-or-a-forward  But who knows if the votes are split between center and forward maybe he won't get enough
10 is nothing. Have you heard of James Harden? Or even Joel Embiid?

I was initially thinking Joel Embiid but yeah on second thought Ant probably takes the crown
And Joel Embiid
1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Kevin Durant  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Joel Embiid  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Luka Doncic  10. Damian Lillard  this is the objective list. you cannot disagree with me
"Embiid might be my favorite player not on my team. Guy can play like an old school big man with all the moves down low, but he can also play like a modern big stretching the floor on offense. All respect to Jokic but if I was putting together a team of today’s players I’d probably choose Joel as my center"
"Ok so it seems the frustration comes more from everyone else and how they officials give them fouls, then the actual guy getting hacked in the first place. Joel is just huge, you have to have a skilled bigman with great footwork to have a chance. Just like Jimmy can beat you with his strength or Harden with his mixture of stepbacks and floaters. It's really fucking difficult to guard those guys without fouling, and that seems to be an afterthought for you rather than the reason for their FT rate.  Embiid absolutely gets fouled enough times to have 10 fts a game, it's just not in the same sequences he actually gets the fouls called. Embiid's defenders also get away with things you'd see the backup C earn FT's for. The idea that it doesn't go both ways is a fundamental misunderstanding IMO.  I do watch football, and I know from Mourinho to Inzaghi to Getafe to Neymar people will always be upset when you sell fouls or play a style that's negative. What I don't understand is the basketball equivalent making so much of a difference a player or team can become unwatchable. Joel shoots 11 FT's a game when the whole 4 quarters is like 100 possessions. I just don't see how 5 shooting fouls ruins it THAT much for you when you can't run radically different systems in Basketball anyway"
"Curry, Doncic, Kawhi, Giannis, Embiid  Lillard, Harden, Lebron, Durant, Jokic  CP3, PG13, Jimmy, Zion, Gobert  Ik some might disagree with Embiid over Jokic. Jokic is my MVP because his makes health makes him more valuable than Joel, but on a minute to minute basis Embiid has had a better season and that’s the philosophy I use for my all nba"
"I was so confused at first, I was like Joel EMBIID?"
"Yeah this is how they officiate big men. There will be downvotes, but Embiid gets hacked all game and obviously the refs don't/can't call them all. Meanwhile a perimeter player gets breathed on too aggressively and it's two at the line. That's why it's so interesting watching Embiid. Because when he has his back to the basket there is so much contact allowed, but when he faces up the opposing center has his hands completely off of him afraid to make even the slightest contact or Joel will shoot and walk right to the line.   I hate the way they officiate big men. It's just not worth it to operate in the post unless your one or two people. Zion just drives but I guess he gets hacked too."
"Weird way to spell ""Joel Embiid"" but I'll take it."
You're going to have to explain your logic here.  Your current argument is that players are getting injured and missing games before they play the Sixers because of Joel Embiid
"You're a Lakers troll and that's ok.  But let's stay on topic, how many games has Joel Embiid missed in his career vs AD?"
"You could argue The Process was a success as soon as we drafted Ben after having drafted Embiid. You could argue it was a success after we got the top picks that it was designed to get.   Personally I would argue that as soon as it became clear the Ben and Joel were special, for me the first preseason game Joel played in, it was a success. The goal of every team is to win a title. But the goal of the Process specifically was to acquire as many picks as possible, high in the draft where game changing stars are found, and take as many swings there as possible to draft a superstar or superstars. We've already done that. It's up to the next step to actually win a title. This just puts us in a point we hadn't been since Iverson left: real contention."
Op you misspelled Joel Embiid in the title
They’re both eligible as centers and forwards  https://www.libertyballers.com/2021/5/6/22423255/report-joel-embiid-is-eligible-for-first-team-all-nba-as-a-center-or-a-forward
"&gt; doing more with less  Who exactly is an above average starter on the Nuggets now?  Draymond is at least as good as anybody on Denver.  Jokic deserves MVP, he's playing unbelievably while spacing the floor, defending well and contributing a ton with his passing despite not holding the ball a lot.  As for Steph, you don't win MVP on a .500 team.  It's clearly Jokic-Embiid 1-2 and then the rest of the field.  You can put Steph third but when you've got a dominant two-way player on a one seed (Joel) vs a dominant offensive player hoping to sneak into the playoffs it's a pretty easy call."
"The sentiment behind why he would be voted isn't crazy; the argument that Embiid is a forward is absolute unjustifiable nonsense.  If Joel Embiid is a forward Russell Westbrook is a center lol.  Either change the rules or vote by the rules, but don't break the rules just to get the intended result you want."
He thinks he is Joel Embiid
exactly.  The front office at that time was still Colangelo's leftovers though and it seems they were sent in to sabotage the process.  We could realistically have a core of Embiid/Simmons/Butler and then moving Simmons is much easier to swallow.  So Embiid and Butler with Harden is just a few missteps from happening.  The fact we are any good at all after management bungled everything post Hinkie is just a testament to Joel and Ben covering up our weaknesses.  Basically wasted 3 years doing nothing and then 2 years swinging for the fences haphazardly and still are likely to come out the other side as the #1 seed this year.  That is how well the process set us up.  Team still has massive problems because of those years neglecting guard/wing play but after last year im not sure anyone expected this.
"&gt; typical slacker  Ah yes, Joel Embiid is a slacker.  Guys been playing basketball less than a decade and is an MVP candidate and got there by being a slacker.  Do you have any self awareness? It just isn't possible for players to go 100% on offense and 100% on defense.  Have you never heard of teams trying to go at certain players on defense to tire them out for offense? Do you watch basketball"
Daryl Morey would rather stand in front of a speeding train than Joel Embiid confirmed.

Godzilla Joel Embiid is more powerful than Godzilla.
"Injuries are the main reason of concern, but for everybody.  I feel Joel is still improving a lot compared to the player he was just 1-2 years ago, so I can see him still getting better.  On the other side I feel Giannis is entering his prime because I'm skeptical about him getting much better than this.  I mean, unless he build a reliable shot this is the player we'll see at his peak and his peak will be him being like now, but more confident and smarter because of more experience.  Embiid tho really made improvements. His shot is not the same he had 1-2 years ago. He's deadly now and who knows, can even improve. That's why maybe he's not in his prime yet.  If injuries happens then it's not on the player and like in Blake Griffin case or even more in Rose's case, their prime will be a 1 year season, or even something that never existed as for Rose."
"\*ESPN\*  Daryl Morey calls Joel Embiid a THING, showing disrespect for him as a human being."
"Embiid is putting up Shaq stats. But, Shaq did that lazy 30/10 for 4-6 years. Embiid has done it for 30 games. That's the difference. Shaq played like Joel right now for like 8 years straight. It's crazy."

"Bruh imagine is Tatum and Brown got together, could be pretty cool. In all seriousness though I would love if somehow I could just slide Joel Embiid into a green uniform."
Giannis for sure. He was 19 years old his rookie year and doesn’t have a concerning history with injuries. The only one with an MVP and the only one with a DPOY.  Giannis also doesn’t have a positive correlation to winning his rookie year so you have the option to tank his first season. Just make sure you pick Embiid instead of Jabari Parker then boom. Now you’ve got both of them.  Second pick would be Davis. AD was a 19 year old rookie whereas Joel was 22 and needed severe minute restrictions right from the start. Davis’ career in whole looks better at this point. If I’m able to go full process in this scenario and plan to tank then maybe I go Embiid though.
"Fun fact, Joel Embiid is the first center to average 30 PPG since 1982"
"Game didnt feel right without  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Something about this allstar game, just felt... empty."
No Embiid  No KD  No wonder Joel said this is a Mickey Mouse All Star Game
If you can beat a team consisting of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid and then beat the MIL Bucks AND the GSW that’s a solid ass run
"Yes, the NBA held out Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid just so Zion Williamson could start. And his team was probably playing for him for the first few possessions because it's his first ASG."
Joel Embiid just called it a Mickey Mouse all star lmaoo    https://twitter.com/JoelEmbiid/status/1368739295901650945?s=20
I can't believe Adam Silver forced Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons to go get a haircut    😡
"Sixers, Bucks, Nets, Celtics, Heat, and Raptors have players who are talented, and will out execute Knicks players in playoffs with grindfest game Thibs going to coach his players. I know Thibs will be prepare, and will come up with game plan for his players to put them in position to succeed. Nets with KD, Harden, and Kyrie can have easy time with multiple actions they can run. Maybe Sixers if Joel Embiid be better playmaker in post, and Ben Simmons be scoring threat."
"Doesn't a big part of Jokic's scoring ability come from his superb playmaking/passing rendering double-teams too dangerous? What I am suggesting is that since Embiid and Jokic score with similar volume and efficiency, but Jokic effectively can't be doubled whereas Joel is basically ALWAYS doubled, then in the sense of the primary defender, Embiid would seem to clearly be the harder player to guard.  It's kind of like Kobe and LeBron back when they shared the league. LeBron might have been putting up better scoring numbers, but a lot of that came straight out of his playmaking - when asked who was harder to guard, everyone who played against them said Kobe."
[Joel “Do a 180” Embiid](https://youtu.be/kEgxlJFMoTg)
&gt; Even with Joel playing out of his mind the game still went to OT.  What's crazy is Embiid played really well but I don't think it was even near his best game of the season.  Stats wise he dominated but he really didn't play his best for half of the game and he still put up 40/19.   Embiid's not always gonna hit three's like that but similarly if the jazz don't shoot like 58% from 3 in regulation while the Sixers shot around 25% this game would be a lot different as well.  I would love to see a finals matchup between these teams because I love the way our teams matchup.  Mitchell vs Simmons and Gobert vs Embiid is great to watch.
"Its because of Joel ""do a 180"" Embiid"
"Yeah, Embiid has never whined about the officiating. lol  My 2 seconds of googling:  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25984963/joel-embiid-strong-words-refs-latest-76ers-loss-celtics/"
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"Uhhh I did not say it was a defensive split. It measures exactly what it says it does. The extra steps relay the stats in a different way paying attention to the number of possessions played and the minutes. So here’s an advanced stat that shows clearly that Jokic has a better combined offensive and defensive effect than Joel Embiid. But you wanna use your stat. That’s cool. But all this stat manipulation is to escape the VERY SIMPLE AND CLEAR FACT that Jokic averages 8.5 apg. He is a dominant playmaker. Embiid isn’t. It’s ok, man. Embiid is a better defensive player. You don’t have to jump through hoops when the answer is obvious. (Ya muffin.)"
omg you have to take into past accomplishments when deciding who is a better player. imagine if i asked you who is a better player joel embiid or lebron? would you pick embiid just because he's having a better season?
"Jokic is super nice don't get me wrong and his playmaking may give him an edge for sure as the assists stats aren't close, but Embiid is averaging more pts and rebs (barley) currently and their 3 pt % is almost dead even (which is incredibly surprising). Jokic is more efficient offensively, but I'd give Joel the nod defensively. So I think it's pretty close statistically."
"I definitely see your point, but that’s the defensive scheme the Jazz run. Gobert is much more valuable defending the paint than he is chasing Embiid around the perimeter. I absolutely give credit to Embiid for the way he played. He shot really well from outside, but those are the shots you want him taking. If he makes shots like he did last night you just have to tip your cap. Even with Joel playing out of his mind the game still went to OT. I’m not sure losing an overtime game to the MVP favorite invalidates the Jazz defensive scheme or what Gobert has been doing all year."
"Just sharing the stat line so everyone is aware it wasn’t just a downpour of 40 and 19 only on Gobert. That’s all. Not taking anything away from Joel here. Embiid is a stud and absolutely deserving of MVP this year.  Also...DPOY obviously isn’t decided by one or two games. As a season award, gotta increase your sample size and take all season games into account"
Joel Embiid or Giannis
Just here to remind everyone that Joel Embiid is still going to win MVP over this chump even after James got away with trying to end his season in the Lakers loss to Philly.  They're gonna have to delay space jam to maximize profits because there's no way for the league to explain away giving James MVP this season.
"You dont think it has anything to do with our improved spacing leading to more 1v1 opportunities for Joel Embiid, who simply cannot be defended 1v1 unless you hack him?"
"Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"
"Embiid always had the ability.  Just that this season he came into it IN SHAPE.   Before,  Joel would dominate for 3 quarters and fade in the 4th.  This season, he's in shape and stayed in shape....now he's performing at an all star level in the 4th &amp; in the clutch.     He's been an absolute monster this season and is easily the MVP so far.  I said at the beginning of the season that Dwight Howard's biggest contribution would be to influence Embiid to take his conditioning seriously,  because Howard is a physical freak.  Having a center on the squad that Embiid respects and can challenge him to be better has done wonders for his game and mentality."
Loved the article that you wrote about Joel embiid owning real estate in other centers heads. which star player owns the most real estate now
"Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist  Obviously Joel had an amazing game and bested Gobert, but I think it’s getting a little overblown. Gobert is still an amazing defender."
"For sure, there's a very strong case for Embiid, dude is playing at an MVP level at his own rite, I'd probably take 2021 Embiid over 8/10 of the last MVP's mvp season and I don't think I can point out a fault in his game this year, I'd be probably perfectly fine if he won.  And I'd like to preface MY personal criteria for MVP would be around the most impactful player regardless of record.   But the assists tell half the story but make the world of difference, the real thing we need to look at is shot creation.  Shot creation is a hard impact to measure individually but probably is the most valuable skills a team could have, usually running the team's offense, 9/10 of the last MVP has been some sort of shot creator because it is so impactful, but obviously Joel has not been asked or needs to shot create more for the 76ers to win.   Ben Taylor's have a good video I suggest people check out.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoLgSWA7n6g&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoLgSWA7n6g&amp;t)  Usually I always take these metrics with a grain of salt but when all advanced stats point to the same thing it's might be a sign- Jokic is leading the league in Winshares, winshares/48, BPM, Value over replacement player.  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/)  538's RAPTOR's impact metric put him as the clear favorite   [https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/](https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/)  BBall-index put's him at the top of wins added   I would make the point though, I feel Embiid might have the advantage on plug and play in any lineup, while Jokic although doesn't need it to be built around him, I think it unlocks a bit more of his potential  &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR both MVPs."

"Shocking take from a philly homer. There were garbage calls all night, and Joel Embiid is a classless punk. Let’s not pretend Gobert isn’t the DPOY because he had a couple bad games against the two top MVP candidates. There really isn’t a great argument for Embiid. I understand the urge for you Embiid fans to felate yourselves, but idk why you have to also pretend you look cool while doing it.  That being said, the jazz reaction to LOSING that game was pretty disappointing. Mitchel and Conley have so much character normally, it’s not a great look to complain about the officiating, even if there were some blatantly egregious calls downs the stretch. I think the final two minute report will back that up. I’m sure it won’t shut up the arrogant ass 76er fans, but it will provide a bit of solace for those of us who have been critical of officiating throughout the season for all teams."
Yeah that's what he's saying. What he's missing is the refs miss calls on Embiid too. I know that seems like a wild statement but I promise you you can find multiple calls a game that Joel was fouled and it wasn't called. And it's usually on stuff that was called in the same game. The refs just don't call every foul.   Embiid gets more foul calls because he gets fouled more than Jokic. But they both have fouls that are not called.
OP I'm curious as to why you think Joel Embiid gets calls that other centers don't get if it's not playstyle and skill? I'm genuinely asking.

Joel Embiid is a phenomenal basketball player and a tattle tale

"I'm getting extremely tired of this take that Jokic is a bad defender. Statistically he rates out as solid, above average, and your take about post defense is especially laughable - that's what he's arguably *best* at defensively. He's good in the post. He's good at positional defense and is almost always in the right spot. He's very good at hedging on PnR and recovering to his man, generally. He is tied for the league lead in total steals meaning he has active hands and plays passing lanes. His biggest weakness defensively is defending high screen and roll with a ball handler who has *elite* speed/quickness and pinpoint passing pair with a roll man who has truly *elite* athleticism. There's only really one team in the league who has a pairing like that right now - Atlanta with Capela and Trae Young. And at least part of that struggle is because Denver's defenders often get caught on picks and struggle to recover to their man, which leaves Jokic in the position of having to guard Young and Capela at the same time... which is impossible for all but the very best defenders in the NBA.  And for a bit of proof on Jokic's post defense, lets look at how he fares against Embiid, shall we? Since Embiid is one of the few players who still posts up quite often. They've played each other 5 times and here are their respective stat lines:   Embiid averages 19.8/11.2/3.2/1.2/2.2 with 5 turnovers and 4.6 fouls shooting 37.7/16.7/82.6 in 29.7 minutes per game.  Jokic averages 21.4/8.2/7.0/1.2/0.8 with 2.2 turnovers and 3.4 fouls shooting 48.8/25.0/83.3 in 31.9 minutes per game.  You also undersell how far ahead Jokic is as a playmaker/passer honestly. If Jokic is ""bbq chicken"" (which he isnt, for the most part), Joel is the same as a passer. His turnover rate is by far the highest of any player who scores 20 or more ppg, and right in line with his career average. He still struggles to make the right play passing out of double teams and doesnt often feel the double team coming well. Jokic conversely is one of the very best passers in the NBA, period. There are a couple players I'd put in the conversation with him, but it's a really, really short list."
"The good thing about playing great defensive centers is the teams are used to defending one on one in the post. And they may even somehow think they can *still do this* against Embiid.   It's painfully clear that there is not one player in the league that can guard Embiid one on one. Not anymore.   Gobert wasn't even bad on defense he was just outmatched. Embiid gave him every move he wanted.   Threes, post fadeaways, jab-step mid range shots, show and go, pump and drive, pick and roll, back to the basket drives, face-up drives, put backs, you name it Joel scored on Gobert with it. He also only had two turnovers and shot 50+% from the field and 40% from three to go along with elite defense especially late. Dude was an absolute monster.   Again there are no players that can guard Embiid one on one."
"Joel Embiid seems to have a superhuman ability to watch movements and then perform them flawlessly in a rapid amount of time and practice. From YouTubing white guys shooting, to Hakeem shakes and spins, to Harden sweeps and step backs. It’s amazing. There are rookies coming into the league that have played way more years of organized basketball than Joel has."
Embiid is the much better defender and he is doing this on a team with a PG who kils his spacing while lacking 3 point shooters tbh. They dont ever really win when joel sits.
"All I’m saying is that RAPTOR WAR is on the top of the site for a reason, it’s the main stat. When I’m talking about “all major advanced stats”, I mean the main umbrella ones, not the subcategories, eg it matters that Jokic is leading overall BPM but I’m not looking at OBPM and DBPM as if they’re different major stats. Jokic is leading Win Shares, Win Shares/48 (#7 all time), PER (#1 all time), VORP, BPM (#3 all time), I think for value conversations (MVP) the important stats are cumulative, because that’s how actual value works. What you’re proposing is more like using per-36 stats for a bench player instead of actual output. I also think one of the reasons Embiid’s rate stats are good is because he often plays at an effort level that is unsustainable over a full season, especially on defense- so if he were to play in a way that allowed  to stay on the court it’s unlikely that his rate-RAPTOR etc would be as high as they are, which is worth considering, he basically does the opposite of what Kawhi and LeBron do. But it’s not an “of course Jokic is going to lead it”, i’d argue that Jokic’s far better durability/physical toughness is the #1 reason he’s a better and more valuable player than Embiid. Joel has run out of gas in the playoffs every season of his career (shoots like 43% in the playoffs or something), that’s not a good thing."
"i want joel embiid to remake ""this is america"" music video if he wins mvp"
"In his entire life, Embiid has only played basketball for 10 1/2 years   4 of those years he was an NBA all star   1 of those years he's the leading MVP candidate   oh and 2 of those years dude was hurt.   Joel is a basketball savant."
"Yes because we all know that all the refs are a huge fan of Joel Embiid, and even the Sixers in general for that matter *sarcastically*. I’ve been a Donovan Mitchell fan since he was in college, and I like how he handled it in the post-game interview, but he can’t blame the refs for that loss. He shot shit from the field and flipped out when Embiid got pushed in the back by Rudy who didn’t even contest the ball. The refs are in neither of these teams favor and the game was over before Mitchell fouled out. I have so much respect for Donovan, and I know the refs are shit, but I wished could have handled it a little bit better."

Joel “Lebron James” Embiid out here playing and officiating. MVP
Joel Embiid is just Kevin Durant but also a DPOY change my mind
Joel embiid is fucking annoying omg
"Joel actively missed a shot in the closing minute of the fourth because he was trying to draw the contact and threw up a wild ball instead of going for an actual shot.There's more than just one example of this In this game alone. You need to pay more attention to your own players game and get your rose colored glasses checked because their prescription is bad.  Embiid consistently jumps into players just like three point shooters jump into defenders to get free throws. I think all of that garbage needs to be out the game I agreed with you on that for threes. That being said even with it being a stupid thing that refs call there was contact on those threes and they do reward that with free throws incorrectly in today's nba. All of that is still not what donovan is talking about, like I said the little cheap free throw crap is what the good players in the league do to get free throws because they know the refs call it. The frustrating thing for a player is to be hit hard out of the air on something that is a risk to your body and not get the call you think should be there. You also addressed only the flopping comment which is subjective and nothing else, you have no critical thinking skills and are just in here on bad faith for the hot take."
Was bad calls on both sides... Gobert knocked joel embiid down right infront of the ref causing him to fall out of bounds and lose the ball and the ref did nothing. Sixers got more calls because they live in the paint where is the jazz shot 44 3s. Officiating isnt going to get better across the league and silver isnt going to do anything about it much like the NFL etc.
Can Basketball survive Joel Embiid?
Do you even watch Joel Embiid play basketball?
"Rudy got caught with his left forearm shoved into Embiid as Embiid went airborne, that's a foul.  Joel lobbying for the T and the ¯\\\__(ツ)__/¯ lmao"
"I mean Joel sold it quite dramatically, but it was indeed a foul. I think the play a second before on Ben was an even more obvious foul though. So do they freak out as much if it's not Embiid and does Mitchell gets T'd up? I believe not."
"Exactly.  Man the fuck up and deal with the circumstances that you are dealt.  The sixers fought their way back in, and Joel took over like an MVP does.  Mitchell wanted to prove a point, as he and Embiid have gotten into it since his rookie year.    Hes gotta chill the fuck out."
"I definitely think Joel Embiid would fit that spot perfectly, stretch 5 and a great defensive presence."
I am blessed to watch Joel Embiid play basketball
"I seriously do not like Joel Embiid. I’m sure that’s unpopular, but wow do I just not enjoy him or his personality."
"Joel Embiid is going to win MVP/DPOY 2 of the next 3 years and then in January 2024 his efficiency will dip slightly and this sub will be 10,000 comments of ""told y'all Embiid was trash 😒"".  I can't wait."
"True,  it getting Ben Simmons clamped on you and Joel Embiid defending the rim on your drives is pretty tough going. He was clearly frustrated, be it the officiating or the suffocating defense, which led to him just tossing a few up and then losing his cool."
"Joel ""scared of Gobert and Myles Turner"" Embiid  back to back games on sonning them both lol.  Theyll do anything to disparage this man"
You are forbidden from hating on Joel Embiid today. Thank you for understanding
"Tobias Harris was one Joel Embiid three away from being crucified, now he should be deservedly getting praise lol"
"If you drop it to 35pts/10reb games, they both have 8. Joel is going to score more because that's the Sixers best gameplan. He is always going to get more offensive opportunities to score. Your team has a top 10 facilitator which takes a huge load off Embiid. Their games and roles aren't similar. Let's just enjoy the fact we got the two best centers in the game, while the rest of the league wishes they could bang with em. One thing is for certain, Rudy cant guard Embiid or Jokic if his life depended on it."
It's because Gobert is the best defender versus anyone not named Nikola Jokic or Joel Embiid when it comes to defensive metrics.

"First off, tragedy that this game wasn't televised. Two #1 seeds dueling and you don't flex this to national TV? I'm happy because I love Zu and Alaa, but that's ridiculous.  Secondly, I'll always find it extremely off-putting when a player, especially a star like Mitchell, gets two T's in overtime in an absolute dogfight of a game. Puts a sour note on the game for me. Yeah he's heated, his putting it all out there against an elite team, I really don't even care if he said he was gonna fuck the refs mother. Who cares? Let him yell. I'd rather that than complete apathy.   Third, Joel Embiid is just unbelievable. I know this is echoed a lot, but my god. Fucking running out to the three point line and burying a three at the end of regulation, finishing with 40/19, holy fucking shit. I would die for him. I'd die several times if I could if he asked.   Last, shoutout to Dwight Howard. That wasn't turning back the clock, that's a parallel universe. Amazing to not have to play Greg Monroe when Embiid gets a morsel of rest.  Finals preview?"

"There's a huge difference between what Jokic has been put through defensively and what Embiid has done in terms of defensive playoff resume  The series against the Celtics is the only time in a series Joel has had a DRTG above 108.4 (Wiz 21 in only 3 games coming off injury)  The breakdown was entirely our inability to rotate with Horford at the 4. Horford and Jo together posted a 133 DRTG, Embiid by himself was a 109 DRTG. Boston went mismatch hunting not attacking our PnR defence.  Joel has a playoff DRTG of 105 and without him in the playoffs Philly has had a 115 DRTG. He's statistically one of the most impactful playoff defenders of all time. Against Raptors in 19 we posted a 95.6 DRTG with him out there against the eventual champions, even against a scorching hot Kawhi who was spamming PnR against us.  Here's his playoff history and the opponents respective regular season ORTG  |Year|Team|Embiid DRTG|OPP ORTG|Diff| --:|:--|--:|--:|--:| |21|ATL|104.4|114.3|-9.9| |21|WAS|108.4|110.7|-2.3| |20|BOS|120.9|112.8|8.1| |19|TOR|95.4|112.6|-17.2| |19|BKN|87.7|108.9|-21.2| |18|BOS|101.1|106.8|-5.7| |18|MIA|93.9|106.2|-12.3|  His defensive impact in all situations simply can't be overstated. If you want to talk about his playoff offensive struggles that's a legitimate concern for me, but defensively he's beyond reproach, even against teams that ran 5 out against us."
"we are closer to a first round exit than a finals contender  theres no flow to the offense (even with Ben we never really had any flow), really suck at limited fast break offense, are hurt without Ben to defend the best players, and still lack any type of perimeter play maker shot maker.  If Ben came back and it was water under the bridge we still have a lot of problems but we have more problems without him.   The only dynamic players on the team that can do more than one thing are a 2nd year player in Tyrese Maxey (hot start but cant be sold on him yet) and Joel Embiid.  We have way too many one note players and still no guards/wings that can get their own shot at the end of a game.  It is too easy to swarm Embiid, he needs a release valve."
"Because Doc's preferred offensive attacks are pounding the ball in to Embiid (which hasn't been as effective this season) or pushing Tobias ISOs which are inefficient and don't create good looks for others. We don't emphasize PnR with a high energy PG or for Seth pulling up in 3s. We don't utilize DHOs in the same effective way Joel did with JJ Redick.   It's not just ""Blah, Doc sucks"" - Doc goes to the same shit and he is not quick to adjust anything."
Fuck Joel embiid for injuring suggs (no call of course btw)   That is all
"Looked like his issue was only with Morris.. even Jimmy later was getting at one of the assistant coaches and not  him..  Personally I'm fed up with the Jokić vs Embiid pick a side shit. I'm a sixers fan first and foremost but those two are my favorite players. Both so fun to watch. Only real rivalry between fan groups is because they both play center and were 1-2 in MVP race.   Maxey been a bit off but he has had such a nice streak going. Need Tobias to keep it up. Drummond been surprising me, a couple over-ambitious pass attempts aside thought he did well while Joel rested"
It's going to go 7 games for sure  My big fear is I can see CP3 trying to hog the ball too much to flex vs Steph and that may ruin the team if he doesn't do that we can pull it off.   One crucial advantage is Ayton is the perfect centre not named Joel Embiid vs the Warriors he can dismantle their small ball system while he's good enough to hold on his own defensively

"Joel Embiid scored 42 points yesterday, Steph had 0, does that make Embiid the best player in the league? See how dumb it looks when you overreact to a small sample size? Let’s maybe look at more than 20 games. No one’s saying Curry isn’t one of the best ever and is maybe the best in the league right now but to say it’s obvious or something makes you look dumb."
Joel Embiid
"OP misses the real point of the rules changes, and that was generally to stop outrageous fouls 20+ feet from the basket not give defenders a free pass to jump. In these clips of embiid he’s never launching himself in unnatural motions or angles. The defenders jump and joel makes a move towards the rim creating contact.   The new rules will always be emphasized beyond the 3 point line. Inside the paint and around the rim these are defensive fouls"
In a league that most free throw rate have cratered Joel is at his all time high.   The stats are the stats and embiid is getting calls no one else is getting
"First time I saw Embiid after watching a lot of Joker, I was shocked at the number of calls Joel got. Same plays were consistently called for embiid, while people get to chop a lot on joker's arms."
This is what I’ve always found funny about AD. He’s super efficient at the rim that even though he’s a terrible shooter his overall efficiency is still good (but not great for a big). He’d be a much more impactful player if on offense he played like a better version of Rudy Gobert than taking a bunch of crap midrange fadeaways. Fwiw this was also somewhat true of Joel Embiid prior to last year when he was hitting absolutely everything.
Both of your points are false. If Kawhi misses that shot it goes to overtime. And Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid were the first two options.

"This was probably one of the worst last possessions i've seen in a while. You have a 300 pound 7 footer who has 42 points, including going 16-21 in the FT line and Seth Curry, but the best shot you get is a contested three-pointer falling backwards by Embiid?  This is so laughably bad and probably the reason why Philadelphia won't do shit in the playoffs with or without Ben Simmons. Doc Rivers is just the worst, Joel Embiid thinks he is a guard in late game situations and they don't have a PG. Unreal how much talent they are wasting."

Joel “Harden” Embiid
"Joel ""despite the loss"" Embiid"
"we choked in the 4th, but the refs helped. how the fuck does joel embiid get 5 more FT attempts than our entire team? that was some bullshit. cant believe we won lmao"
    &gt; Has Joel Embiid
Unless you’re Marc Gasol vs Joel embiid
"I’ve been an irrational hater for a while because people told me he was better than Embiid for a long time even though he never wanted any smoke from Joel H2H, and I gotta say…  Reality slowly moving towards my biased, uninformed opinion feels phenomenal. Especially since it’s tanking the Lakers."
"He falls on purpose, to avoid injury. [Joel Embiid falls down a lot because his doctors told him to](https://sports.yahoo.com/joel-embiid-falls-down-lot-120043564.html)"
Joel Embiid on the list and he’s higher than Jokic
It did not feel like an accident because it was not an accident. He should have been ejected for shoving Joel Embiid midair last season.
The hype train started slowing down his last year at Kansas to be fair.  Seeing him next to an actual future superstar in Joel Embiid really flipped the script for a lot of people.
"The ""normal"" top 5 is something along the lines of  Steph Curry  Giannis  Jokic  KD  LeBron  now the guys that have the argument for being top 5  Kawhi  Joel  Harden  Luka  so it's probably 9 deep. I do not consider AD a guy that belongs in the top 5 conversation anymore. He just hasn't played well enough to justify it.   But basically Embiid if he's healthy and playing well is a top 5. Luka is a top 5 if he's just playing well but he's been slow to start. Kawhi when healthy and in the playoffs is arguably the best guy in the league. Harden has that top 5 potential, but it shifts depending on his shooting and other stuff.   Then beyond that comes the borderline top 10, Jimmy Butler, PG13, CP3, Dame Lillard, etc. basically guys that are good, maybe not #1 option good, or just have big holes in their game that need good complementary pieces to really win, at their best they're the 1b. guy."

"How can he be a better scorer, when he is worse at every aspect of scoring in comparison to Embiid. What scoring skills does AD exactly have? Embiid is so much better than AD at rebounding that your statement is not even funny, it's just sad. Joel averages an entire rebound more than AD over his career. He gets a higher percentage of his rebounds too. 20% to 16.5 percent is pretty significant. AD is a better overall defender, I will give you that but Embiid is a top 2 rim protector in the league and as everyone repeatedly points out, rim protection is ultimately the most important thing for Embiid's position"
Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers criticizing Ben Simmons is a big deal. That was very unpopular on r/Sixers....
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Joel embiid says hi
"&gt; Because that mutha***** is special. For real. Any time I text him, which we text plenty, FaceTime, phone calls. I always tell him, ‘Continue to show why you’re the best player in this league.’ Because I saw it. I saw it. He can do everything. Like, legit, he can do everything. He works and I respect it. He works. And then he’s in the house. He’s with his girlfriend. That’s how you become the best player, you’ve got to be obsessed with it. And he is. He is.      I think the bond just grew from there, because he would always ask questions. We’d always watch film together. And yeah, we’d be joking around a lot, too. But he wants to do right and when he does wrong and you tell him, he’ll be like, ‘Yeah, you’re right. You’re right.’ I was like, you know what, you’re a real mutha*****. When somebody tells you you’re wrong, you’re like, ‘Yeah.’ And thinking about it, you’re like, ‘OK, OK, I see what you’re talking about.’ If somebody tells me I’m wrong, I’m like, you could be right, or maybe I could’ve handled that better. Like, ‘Yeah, you’re probably right.’  [source](https://www.phillyvoice.com/jimmy-butler-joel-embiid-sixers-heat-nba-philadelphia-miami/)  But yes, go on with made up narratives"
i would like it if joel embiid played basketball for the sixers he's already missed half the season.  pretty coooooooool
76ers are better against the Warriors without Embiid.  Joel would have puked at halfcourt by now
The best center in the NBA is actually Joel embiid
"You can't seriously blame Embiid for saying ""I don't care about that man"" after months if Ben showing he doesn't give a shit about the team. He came back for money and then ignored his teammates. Joel did everything the org asked him to do to stay cival, when he's not exactly know for biting his tounge.  Stop making excuses for Ben Simmons. He can have mental health problems AND be a selfish narcissist."
"He's played in 70% of games the last 3 years. It's not that bad. Davis has played in 71%, KAT is at 67% and Joel Embiid is at 68%. Just the price of a modern big man in todays fast pace NBA it seems."
"The Sixers, for most of a season, started Ben Simmons, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid. Please don't ask us questions like this."
"I just think doc rivers and joel embiid are kind of self righteous dicks at times and they need some major culpability for how they threw Ben under the bus. Even though he fucked up, he still was guarding trae a ton, putting in a major defensive effort.  And they acted like he did nothing all series, and then did the whole change their tone after the fact..."
"right now? James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal,  Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, Karl Anthony Towns, arguably Demar Derozan"
i hope kyrie never plays basketball again  i also hope joel embiid doesn’t win shit in his career
Ben Simmons never plays another minute in the NBA and the Sixers have to rebuild again because they made Joel Embiid angry
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
That's literally Joel Embiid
Anthony Davis  Giannis Jokic  Jayson Tatum Zion if healthy (not lookin likely but still) Ja Morant  Joel Embiid  Lamelo Ball Anthony Edwards Deandre Ayton  Evan Mobley  Emoni Bates  Bronny Jr Victor Wembayana  These are just the standout talents of you told me they are going to be the best player in the world I can clearly see why   What is Luka’s why?
"Watch the 76ers in the bubble playoffs, it's always Joel embiid going 1 vs 5 with his teammates giving up. I always wondered why they got a free pass for giving up on the team    Also in the same playoffs , the rockets could have been up 2-0 or 3-1 vs the Lakers if only James harden showed up in the 4th quarters for game 2 and 4 and 5 for that manner too"
Joel Embiid = Todd MacCulloch. I think I'm doing this right.
Joel Embiid   Tyrese Maxey   Tobias Harris   Ben Simmons   Seth Curry   Danny Green   Mattisse Thybulle   Furkan Korkmaz
"No order, Lebron, KD, Kyrie, Paul George, Kawhi, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Giannis, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, AD on days when he feels like dominating. These are just guys that I enjoy watching who I think are top 10 when they’re playing at their best."
"I will always hate LeBrun after throwing Embiid to the ground during pre season on a dunk  LIKE THE PUNK BITCH LEBRON IS, MAKING JOEL LAND ON HIS BAD BACK"
I think I have witnessed LeBron being pushed like this more then 1000x times over the last 20 years. I haven't seen Livingston being dirty but I've seen Embiid doing the same to eather DeAndre Jordan or John Collins multiple times in single games. Why is this event with LeBron and Joel singled out so much?
"&gt;If a fight broke out every time someone got smacked in the face the league   We both know it wasn’t just a smack in the face. The dude got intentionally punched in the face and was profusely bleeding which then triggered a fight or flight response.   If he had been all sunshine and roses after getting hit that would’ve been more concerning than him trying to go after the guy that just clocked him.   We saw Jokic do the same thing to Morris when he made a dirty play on him, and I promise you if that Joel punch a few weeks ago had connected on Lonzo Ball we would’ve saw Joel Embiid get jumped on live television.   What’s not reasonable is the leagues’ leniency on dirty plays despite them claiming to want and avoid situations like this."
"I believe his generational comparisons were more reminiscent, at least to me, of Kentucky's John Wall, who was also regarded in a similar fashion but, in my opinion, was also a little overhyped.   We all knew about LeBron, but we also have to remember that with a healthy Joel Embiid, Wiggins is maybe not the first pick.  Wasn’t there like tell-signs at Kansas?  I can’t even remember."
Let’s ask Joel Embiid or Steph Curry if Lebron is not the type of player to do this.
"Literally any punch from any UFC fighter would probably hurt more than any NBA player other than like Joel Embiid, Jokic, those guys lol."
Joel embiid would disagree with this take
Sixers fans have known that since last year. Just ask Joel Embiid.
"James Johnson, Joel Embiid, Dwight Howard, Tyler Herro, Steven Adams"
Hahaha i think like 3 Lakers fans replied to me trying to persuade me that LeBron didn't aim for his face. He didn't mean to do ittt.  They're probably right. I think he was aiming for the throat. LeBron done something similar in the past when he pushed Embiid while he was midair for a dunk and Joel fell really bad. LeBron stared at him on the ground and walked away. Hes done shit like this. People just forget or think he didn't mean to do it. The King always get a passs
"As much as it pains me to say.  Joel Embiid.  Went from MVP level to average statistically, and has been out for a big part of the year so far.  He will almost certainly pick it up, but he was quite disappointing so far."
Shit for LeBron I think the sixers would offer Ben Simmons a couple of first-round draft picks and Joel Embiid desire to chase after Rihanna
You already know if Joel gets injured people going to post how they dont care about embiid etc. Gotta go the full circle.
&gt;Simmons hasn't even proved that he can be a #2 option  he is 2 time all star who has winning record even without Joel Embiid
"&gt; unless the Pistons unexpectedly decided to throw Cade Cunningham, this year's No. 1 overall pick, into the mix. Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  Lol, Morey is fucking delusional at this point."
Joel Embiid -esque
Morey must think he trading Joel Embiid. There is no way he actually believes that Ben is worth as much as Cade Cunningham AND Jerami Grant
"Joel Embiid, used to consider him a big mouth guy that cant back it up, cant manage his body with constant issues, also soft af and flops a lot, love to shoot mid range and 3s that dont go in. But the runner mvp season changed my mind"
"&gt;  Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  It's quite straight forward. Cade Cunningham is a maybe. On this like, Ja Morant would require a lottery protected 1st. Fox, probably an unprotected 1st.  Again, I can reason with not trading him for a bs package. But Cade for Simmons is a straight up yes, not a ""uhn, let me think here for a bit""."
That's not what he said to Rachel Nichols.  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/lebron-james-thought-long-and-hard-about-playing-sixers-ben-simmons-joel-embiid
"Do Philly fans struggle with reading comprehension?  &gt; unless the Pistons unexpectedly decided to throw Cade Cunningham, this year's No. 1 overall pick, into the mix. Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  It's the fact even if DET threw in Cade, Morey would consider it. It's fucking delusion at this point."
"&gt; Even then, the timeline Cunningham is on relative to Joel Embiid would make that a tough proposition for Philly to say yes to.  Your boy Neubuck needs to chill with Morey dick riding."

I went to a sixers warriors game in Philly in like 2017 or 2018. Joel Embiid and Steph Curry are both just not human. Warriors fans are so lucky that they have Steph man. Hes so impressive.
"Joel ""Neymar"" Embiid."
"Link below for the ""find a new slant"". Bryan Colangelo, metaphorically speaking, has a tiny, tiny penis.    https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz"
"Yeah I watch Philly games, Maxey is legit. Will be interesting to see how his numbers change once Joel is back. Just think Fox is better player now and match with Embiid timeline, however I understand the reluctancy to wait at least until the deadline."
Yeah... Those guys aren't Joel Embiid.
"yea, since embiid has been on the roster we basically havent had a single player (outside of jimmy for 30ish games) with a quick first step that is capable of beating guys off the dribble.  Drive and kick game has been basically nonexistant because of this and the pick and roll is a rare occurrence as well.    Even when Joel comes back he should have the ball A LOT, he keeps it moving and it helps all our shooters running the offense through him as he can get a defense off balance with his dribble drive game.  Running the offense through Tobi on the other hand is like being stuck in the mud everything stops forever and he won't give up the rock."
"Bro so much of what you said is madness that I'm not even sure I can cover it all but I'm still working so I guess I'll try:  In paragraph order:  1. Teams don't want to trade for him? Then don't.   2. Sixers title window is now? Embiid is 27 so yeah he's in his prime, but not exactly an old man and his major injuries were both before he even played his first game and since he finished growing haven't been a concern. But anyway adding the type a player(s) it seems we both agree that Ben would get right now is not gonna make the Sixers any better than they are right now. They were 8-2 before they got decimated by COVID and even if they don't finish top three or four they are definitely making the playoffs. By then Ben will have come back or his replacement will have. This isn't the NFL we got time. No team that started off slowly is panicking.   3. I agree. No idea why anyone would trade a top 30 player for Ben. I assume Daryl knows this too. Better than we do for sure. Doesn't change the price because again, *we do not have to trade Ben Simmons*.  4. Look, you seem like a smart person. I consider myself to be a smart person. But I promise you if you have thought of this possibility then Morey has as well. I know people think since he hasn't made the trade that he's some slack jawed idiot now but he knows the possible outcomes and has factored them in. Personally I don't think he's built that way but we'll see. I think he respects himself and his teammates too much for that. Not being on the court is a hell of a lot different than being on there sabotaging your team. That would be a terrible look for him personally.   5. Joel is smart enough to understand that Ben gives this team the best chance to win. Failing that we need someone on that level. Joel doesn't give a shot about role player or picks and prospects. We got enough role players we need a star. Ben is.   6. The owners gave Morey the authority to handle team affairs however he sees fit and I've heard no indication from insiders that that has changed. It's not like we're floundering out there without him, COVID is what's killing us right now.   7. Players want money. They want championships. They are not gonna pass on good opportunities because Rich and Ben decided to try to force a trade with four years left on a contract. I have zero concern about this."
What a fucking waste of Joel Embiid.
"it sounds like you're just getting defensive about your team instead of realizing the cold truth  how this gets worse:  \- All the teams around the league know they have the leverage right now, not Morey. Why would teams overpay or even adequately pay, for a distressed asset? Especially one that is shook mentally and has an attitude that Ben is displaying. What value would Ben actually bring to a different team and their own ambitions? You don't think this is a giant red flag for any team that cares about team chemistry or a team that is missing a crucial chess piece away from title contention?  \- Sixers title window is now. Who knows what the future will look like, but Embiid is not known for being an iron man. He gets injured a lot. You have Joel in his prime and Morey is playing a game of chicken holding out on trades. Sixers at full health without Simmons are not getting out of the East.   \- Per the Athletic article, Sixers have a list of about 30 of so desirable players they are willing to trade Ben for. Why would these other teams give up an asset that good for... Ben??? Why don't these other teams just trade amongst themselves for something better? Sixers will be lucky if they don't have to attach additional assets to Ben to move him.  \- Sure, Morey can just ""be comfortable with being uncomfortable"" for the rest of the 4 years on Ben's contract. Ben can just easily suit up and go through the motions to get his game paycheck. Or if he wants to get really petty, play crappy basketball and get benched anyways. That will really hurt the Sixers ambitions to compete for the title.  \- Joel is not going to forever support this approach by Morey. He knows his time is now, it's only a matter of when Joel's patience wears thin and he complains to management to actually DO SOMETHING to help him win now.  \- how long will the owner's patience be for this? Before he finally tells Morey to just get the deal done. Sure everything is okay now, but you have a wasted roster space in Ben... when you can actually be putting that roster space to good use to make the team more competitive for a title.  \- Other players and agents will make note of Morey's unwillingness to cooperate. The players make the league, Ben was once considered a star. Other stars will note how Morey is handling this situation by not agreeing to a star's trade demands. History has shown that when an NBA star wants to be traded, it is in the best interest of the team to trade him. Nothing good comes from the team holding out just to ""stick it"" to the player. The teams are at the mercy of the talent, which is how it should be because the talent is what makes the league a marketable product for consumption.  &amp;#x200B;  Get over yourself Morey and offload Ben for whatever you can, because it will only get worse."
"Well I guess Embiid won't win a championship woth the Sixers if this happens.  So doing this move hurt who? Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Simmoms because he continues in the drama either handling it badly or playing somewhere he doesn't like while his value plummets. Embiid because they are wasting his prime.  This only helps Morey and his ego. In the end, if he waits 1 or 2 years to move him, what value will he have left?  This move makes me sympathize with Ben. If only he came back, held his head down, played and just shoot 3s. He gets his paycheck and if Morey wants to play games he'll make him regret forcing him to play.  Cherry on top would be if Ben plays, the hold him and pay him for 2 years and he retires or something at the end."

"Anyone looking forward to Nikola Jokic and his team vs Joel Embiid and his team tonight? Nikola Jokic and his team are looking good, but I still think Stephen Curry and his team will finish first in the reg season"
"I look at it as Morey and Embiid trading an 8/10 lineup this season for what they *hope* is a 9/10 lineup next season (or maybe even a 9.5 or 10/10 the season after).   ...it's absolutely a risk. But I get why they think it's a good move. Anyone watching our games so far would immediately notice Joel...I don't want to say coasting, but clearly going out of his way to avoid putting himself in a position to risk injury."
"negotiated on the tennis court  https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/08/joel-embiid-and-daryl-morey-are-a-formidable-tennis-pairing.html  which is lowkey the actual issue with Ben(IMO).   he sees himself as the guy who they should cater to.  And if you look at the roster construct since he got here, Ben was. Embiid was Hinkie's crown jewel pick and the FO post Hinkie hated how much credit he got.  Colanglo took Ben, then his minions took over for him.    Then Morey got here and flipped it around and obviously favored Embiid."
"The NBA is one business, that's who you work for. It's like getting reassigned in a business which is pretty normal. Joel Embiid can't get traded to a Greek professional team, because he works for the NBA."
"Because like 99% of defense doesn't show up in the box score, but the box score is more or less all we have when it comes to stats.   If you're on the floor for 75 possession and get 3 steals but get toasted on the other 72 possessions, you're probably not helping the team.  If you're getting a bunch of easy defensive rebounds, you're probably not doing a whole lot to really secure the board. Luka grabs a lot of rebounds by virtue of... going for them. If he decided to try to leak out, there's a decent chance it wouldn't hurt team rebounding so much, but grabbing them and then launching a pass down court is pretty good, so he does it.  (This is not really to say he's stat padding. The Mavs aren't a great rebounding team.)  The flip side are guys who are really good at boxing out: Adams, the Lopez twins. These guys might not grab plenty of rebounds themselves, but they help the team's rebounding, so they're positives.  The other way we can look at it is by just looking at team results when the guy is on the floor, but that can depend on so much. Who's your backup? Who are you playing with? If I'm subbing in for Joel Embiid, then it probably doesn't matter how good of a defender I am, I'm gonna look bad. If I'm coming in alongside a bad sub for Joel Embiid, I'm really screwed. We can maybe correct for these things, but it'll take a long time and big sample.  Also, over a short sample, lineup data can get really funky because of just the streakiness of 3pt shooting. ""Wow this team full of kind of OK defenders is doing really well on D, what is it?"" Most of the time it's just teams shooting 25% from 3 for a short period."
Good thing Joel Embiid leads us.
"He's taller? Bro he plays a different position Lol, no kidding he's taller, and Joel Embiid is a taller Pat Bev with better D.  The funny part is Vic is actually shorter than the average NBA shooting guard, where Russ is ever so slightly taller than the average PG, so your point is completely off base. Let alone mentioning how different of play styles they have."
Someone that can keep up with Joel a bit. Jordan sucks and is always a net negative against Embiid.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201711130LAC.html  vs.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201811040BRK.html
"However, Brad Beal and Joel Embiid on the same team tho 👀"
hearing Joel Embiid is crying because his 2nd option will average 13 ppg in the playoffs
Liar. Your flair clearly says you're Joel Embiid.
"Please tell me how Joel Embiid is winning a championship in the East when KD, Harden and Kyrie are on a team together? Ben has regressed offensively this season and he is not the right partner for Joel. Philly should be ashamed that they’re wasting Embiids prime. They have to trade for Beal now or something like that."
"Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, two of the best defensive players in the league?"
They going to get exposed against Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid and Giannis about to feast on this team
Lol umm Joel Embiid going to average 60+ against that team. rofl They have no big men
"What does Joel ""do a 180"" Embiid have to do with this?"
"Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, AD, KAT, Sabonis, Bam,Porzingis.....we have so many elite bigs right now. The big man has absolutely evolved. We could realistically have a Center win MVP while leading the entire NBA in assists, but the big man is far from dead."
"At this stage in 2007, Dirk was on a 3-4 team he won MVP. Phoenix was 4-5 in 2006 to star the year. Cleveland was 4-3 in 2010. MVP rankings shouldn't be allowed until like 20 games in.  Because if we are being honest, Joel Embiid, CJ McCollum, Jaylen Brown or Gordon Hayward have been the most valuable players through 8-9 games. Anyone saying LeBron, Luka, Steph etc... are all projecting."
Joel Embiid gained 99 speed confirmed
"Sure, but look at where his misses are in the shot chart.  It completely explains my point.  Maybe if he would stop shooting 3s and mid-range shots, the game might not have been so close.   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-shot-chart-by-game"
"Joel ""Shaq + Dirk"" Embiid"
"MPJ had one redshirt season, and wasn't injured at all last year. He also isn't injured this year.  The kid is entering his 3rd year of professional basketball........  Joel Embiid? How many years without playing in his first seasons? And how it is going????  *People make some dumb, dumb statements.*"
Joel Embiid played in the 2018 playoffs
Funny enough this is the first thing I see today outside of Reddit.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2926696-start-bench-cut-br-ends-the-ad-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-debate
You clearly have not watched Joel Embiid this year.
Joel Embiid Good
"Joel ""do a 120"" Embiid"
"Except the Sixers were missing their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th scoring options behind Joel. The Sixers lost starters AND 2nd rotation guys, so it’s literally Embiid, an injured Simmons, Danny Green, and a bunch of dudes that under normal circumstances would come in for “garbage time” playing right now, so Embiid and Green did exactly what they needed to do to carry the team to a win."
"Embiid, win-loss record is a very significant factor that historically gets taken into account when voting for All-NBA teams.      Un-realted topic too but Joel Embiid is currently averaging 27/12/3 on 54% shooting from the field. When Karl Malone infamously 'robbed' Jordan of the 1997 MVP he averaged 27/10/5 on 55% shooting. Really puts into perspective how impressive that peak performance was."
One of the best games I’ve seen Joel Embiid play. Just absolutely dominant. When he took over there was nothing the heat could do
"Scene: Summer, 2020. Embiid and Harden stand on opposite sides of a closed door. They both open their fortune cookies and read aloud together ""A journey soon begins, its prize reflected in another's eyes. When what you see is what you lack, then selfless love will change you back."" And from that day forward, Joel became an MVP candidate and James downed 4 milkshakes every morning for breakfast."
"Yeah I mean they should adjust n just play there best d on Rudy, it’s not like he’s Joel Embiid , an offensive powerhouse ."
"Hey, hey, hey let’s be far to Ben here. He *also* stands in the dunker spot when Embiid is isoing in the post because he can’t shoot so his man gets an easy double onto Joel."
"Marc has the knowledge and physical ability to stop him from scoring. Joel Embiid is young, hasn't mastered offense yet."
" Maybe but embiid is still better. Even if they have equal offensive nights, Joel is naturally a more impactful defender. Theres not really an argument for jimmy- Joel is the better offensive and the better defensive player."
"Joel ""1980 Game 6 Magic"" Embiid"
"More like Joel ""Magic"" Embiid.  7 ft point guard. My man ran the half court offense in the second half of the game."

"Kevin Durant: in contact tracing for 5 days because he was with an unknown person who is positive  Bradley Beal: in contact tracing because he chatted with Tatum after the game  Joel Embiid: rubbed his hands on face after dapping up Seth Curry, sat next to him on the bench, shared a locker room with him, not in contact tracing   &gt;just going by the standards they set up bro"
"Honestly, this is rich coming from a team that employs Joel “swing my arm up randomly to draw a foul” Embiid.  Also, that’s not a bad thing. If you can abuse a rule to help your team win, do it. You don’t extra special brownie points for being an idealist. Fuck that."

\#allstarszn! It's time. I think the East All-Stars right now should/would be (in no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kyrie Irving * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Kevin Durant * Seth Curry * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Jaylen Brown * Jayson Tatum * Julius Randle
"Be Joel Embiid, talk the best trash, never win when it matters."
"You were being rude the entire time sir, ergo you are the hypocrite. You’re in this thread just to insult Sixers fans, I’m just here to look at the funny shit people say. If an hour and a FUCKING HALF is too long when reddit threads typically have discussion going for nearly a day then I don’t know what to say. If you’re not allowed to comment an hour after something in a forum then I don’t think anyone is really allowed to say anything. Lol you’re reading this. Joel Embiid has a history of injuries and if his back is sore then I would say it’s very likely he has a back injury. If he wasn’t injured then he would play, and if he was just sore but not injured he would likely play a few minutes, but not the 30-40 plus needed because he would be number 8 available. Also, Embiid was in close contact with Curry anyway, so he shouldn’t have been cleared to play. That’s the entire issue that people have; the league arbitrarily decided the Sixers need to play despite not having enough players available while postponing other games like Miami’s. Don’t be an asshole, even if it is against a division rival, especially if you’re going to beat them in the playoffs."
With only 8 active guys and 4 being rookies it’s still pretty absurd to have to play games. Ben isn’t playing tomorrow bc of his knee and didn’t even travel so he was really hurt. Plus none of the “close contacts” can play for like 7 days I think. The whole thing is stupid though bc the entire team is a close contact whenever there’s a positive. One of our reporters clipped a pet where Seth dapped up Embiid and Joel then wiped sweat off his face and touched his mouth area and yet he wasn’t considered a close contact? And he also was sitting next to Seth unmasked prior to him being removed from the bench when the results were confirmed
Not better than Steph IMO. There are levels to this. Curry's game is absolutely perfected. Joel looks much better this season especially passing out of the double teams but he needs to show consistency throughout the season with the low turnovers and high FG%. Steph is carrying the Dubs literally and figuratively. Sixers have Seth and Tobias in amazing form and that has been helping Embiid a lot.
"Mike Scott was forced to suit up because Ben and Joel claimed “injuries” right before the game. That was the Sixers call.  If Mike Scott hadn’t suited up, the Sixers would have forfeited - unless they could prove that Embiid and Simmons had real injuries. Otherwise teams would just be claiming injuries to get postponements all season."
"Giannis in the long run, right now Embiid but jokic has a chance to take it if he plays extremely well and depending on how Joel keeps up."
"How about if you ask KAT, a young, healthy, athletic basketball, who makes even more than Anthony Edwards, what would he say? Would he say yes, despite all of the loss and suffering he has faced? What about Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, who has a newborn son. Oh wait the both of them sat. Postponing the game still gets the NBA players their game checks. Just at a later date. Which is fine, they are making plenty to hold themselves over. You’re being ridiculous, frankly. And your perception of money is clearly different than mine."
"Kevin Durant: shut down for 7 days after being in close contact with an unknown positive person, despite testing negative himself  Joel Embiid (and Ben Simmons): literally on video rubbing his hands on his face after a high five with Seth Curry who is positive, also tests negative, but available to play?"
"I think y’all have no idea how contact tracing and close contacts are actually determined. Jayson Tatum was just ruled out for two weeks, the NBA isn’t pulling strings so Joel Embiid is cleared to play."
"Seth is out b/c covid. I believe the other 2 are out for general rest reasons. Joel was recently in the close contact group but was cleared from it so hes at least able to dress. Whether Embiid should be cleared or not is another question, he was sitting next to Seth on the bench during the 1st quarter before people knew Curry had covid"
Don’t forget other comparisons from that draft lol.   Joel Embiid was next Olajuwon and Aaron Gordon was the next Blake Griffin.   One of the more overhyped draft classes haha
I’m questioning how Danny Green isn’t cleared but Joel Embiid is.   Joel shook hands with Curry and immediately touched his face afterward on Wednesday. It’s on camera. That’s a huge “close contact” exposure — I can’t think of a single expert that would clear a close contact exposure like that.   Meanwhile there would at least be an explanation for allowing Danny Green to play since there are medical experts that think he would be immune and clear him to play.
Lmfao. Sixers are saying fuck you to the league.   Absolute joke. Seth Curry was fucking positive on the bench on national television. He traveled with the entire team that day while positive with Covid. We already have a staff member test positive. Joel Embiid physically touched Seth on the bench and then wiped his face twice.   I get fans don't want unfair circumstances regarding postponements. But the precedent was set with Houston and this is a worse situation.   Absolute clown show.
"[[Woj] The Sixers have been talking to Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons about their availability to play today, but in this case, the hard part for the franchise will be that no injury had been shared with the league's basketball operations department, sources tell ESPN.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1347970322872594438?s=20)"

"Looks like we are getting [Joel Embiid, Danny Green and Paul Reed,](https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/1347950129396019200) back but that still only gets us to 9 players. lol"
"No one said that about Joel Embiid. He’s from Africa. Some counties keep better records than others. The Congo is notorious for not being one of those countries.   When there are several million dollars at stake for a player being a few years different in age, with no real way of proving if someone is falsifying their birthday, it’s not “total bullshit” to question the validity of a player’s claimed age."
Joel Embiid is averaging 24.8/11.8/3.3 in 32 mins of play on splits of 52.5/45.8/83.3... 76ers are 7-2 (best record in NBA) and he’s playing defense at a very high level. Philly looks different so far.   Harden has been crucified and has only won ONE MVP for doing pretty much the same shit that Steph is doing rn. If Bron couldn’t win in 2018 because his team wasn’t winning enough there’s no way Steph is gonna win.
"how is joel ahead of steph lmao  joel is 16th in ppg and steph is 2nd, steph's the solo offensive star on his team, embiid is teamed with a bunch of them, joel's got rebounds but steph has assists.  and it's not even 10 games into the season yet."
Ask Joel Embiid

Joel Embiid really did not want to play tonight it seems. He doesn’t seem like his head is in the game at all. That might apply to the entire team actually.
"https://twitter.com/SixersLegion/status/1314568377097236480  &gt;This morning Joel Embiid lost his dog, Klaus Hinkie De Paula Embiid, due to internal bleeding from elevator doors closing on him late last night.   &gt;Prayers out to Joel &amp; Anne, that’s a tragic way to lose a pet."
Yes if they can do the following  1. Joel Embiid stays healthy  2. Ben Simmons cancels out one of the Jays 3. Seth Curry/Tobias Harris can play at 80% of their current levels.
"Or Joel ""WebEmbiid"" Embiid"
"They banned me for saying that Joel Embiid needed to go back to Africa, even though I explained that I'm not saying that in a racist way. I said it because he's from Cameroon, which is in Africa. If I were bashing Ben Simmons, I'd say he needs to take his ass back to Australia."

"Joel Embiid is 7'0"" &amp; 280 lbs.     No matter how ""light"" LeBron pushes him, that's a LOT of weight falling down onto the ground and onto one's back. Considering that Embiid is a bigman, that could have easily been a lot scarier and trying to downplay it is being willfully ignorant."
"I get that it’s a flagrant and he deserved it. But I mean, what would your reaction be if you had Joel Embiid flying at you in a split second? Mine would be to push my arms out to brace for contact. There wasn’t a load up to his push or anything showing it was more than a natural reaction. A dangerous play, but y’all go too far. You’re just mad at the result, guys don’t normally fall that hard but Embiid is fucking huge."
"That’s like saying “Lebron pushed Joel Embiid in front of a car. Embiid got hurt by the car, not Lebron”  If Lebron doesn’t push him that doesn’t happen and he dunks it and lands on his feet."
"Sixers winning this game wasn’t a surprise. An absolute elite team and anybody who disagrees haven’t been watching much Sixers basketball this season. Embiid is top two for the MVP (so far) this season and he’s not two. Ben is playing elite defense and getting his teammates involved in all aspects of the game, even without shooting jumpers (as a Sixers fan it makes me mad he hasn’t expanded his game, so slander can be made here) but if slander is made, at least acknowledge how valuable he is in other areas of the game as well. Tobias is playing arguably his best career basketball. Seth Curry is lights out and shooting career highs. Shake Milton is a 6MOTY candidate, if not front runner. Dwight Howard is adding a much needed spark in the absence of Joel when he is on the bench.   And last but not least, our commander Doc Rivers is the much needed coaching expertise our young core needed. Sixers by an absolute million and I’ll see you guys in the finals.  Edit; Sixers are an elite team barring any major injuries to Ben Simmons or worse, Joel Embiid, since he is the heart and soul of this squad."
The free throw numbers make something in me want to curl up and die because they're literal free fucking points and you shouldn't *have* to be LeBron James or Joel Embiid to make them at a reasonable rate...   But beyond that it was a very entertaining game.
"Eh, if LeBron sits out every team he's been on has been historically worse, even this team. It's close  I'd argue we're arguably worse without LeBron out there than you guys minus just Joel, even with the acquisitions we made this offseason to combat that  Nothing to take away from Embiid, as he's definitely an MVP frontrunner, but I think you could make the case for LeBron just over him if we're goin off this argument"
Joel Embiid is the offspring of KingKong &amp; Godzilla
Embiid loves playing with Joel.
"At least you can understand how this happened mentally. She's talking about Embiid so the name Joel is just in her head as she says Simmons' name. We can absolutely all relate to this kind of flub.  Marv, on the other hand, likes to pull names out of thin air, mixing up people who aren't on the same team, confusing people who look nothing alike, and playing loosy-goosy with the actual distance of a 3 point line."
Joel Embiid flops way too much for the biggest and strongest person on the court.
Embiid loves playing with Joel Simmons
"""Embiid says he loves playing with Joel Simmons"". Doris started drinking early."
Did Dorris just say Embiid said he loves playing with Joel Simmons this year
Embiid loves playing with Joel Simmons?!?!?

"Can someone fucking explain to me why Joel Embiid is allowed to sit in the cool down area without a mask looong after he's been subbed out? Like I get a few minutes without it on, but when it's the entire fucking game...? How is the NBA okay with this?"

Joel Embiid really tried to foul bait Caruso. Imagine doing that when you have 150+ pounds on him lol  Just back him up
Oh yeah lol 300lbs Joel Embiid got flattened by Talen Horton Tucker well played

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."
Joel embiid legit is unstoppable if he’s shooting like this from the line
Joel Embiid is the best basketball player in the league
Marc will hold Embiid to 25/13 and I will be extremely happy. Joel is playing like a whole new player this year
"That’s great to hear, those intangibles are honestly a big reason we won it all last year. I hope Ben and Joel soak up as much as they can from him, he’s really seen it all. I know Embiid was already a really good defender, but so you think Dwight has been able to help him grow even more there?"
"We definitely love having him. I don't usually preach ""intangibles"" but he clearly brings so many: ben and Joel actually BOTH respect and admire him enough for him to be a mentor to them, the bench energy he brings on and off the court, overall super positive attitude, the championship experience, the career he's had and the wisdom he can provide for ben and especially embiid to make the best of their careers. Just so much to love about him with our guys. It's still so crazy how much he's matured and I'm all here for it."
"It is a hot take lol. Especially when you have Joel Embiid over him. Steph, Kawhi, KD, Lebron, and maybe even harden I understand. But Embiid? I’m jus trying to not shit on op but both you and I know this list isn’t accurate"
"As a Laker fan who also considers Joel Embiid as my favorite player right now, I’m all for it.   I think we take them in 5 or 6 games, but the sixers look REALLY good this season. I can’t put a finger on why, but their roster construction feels way better than the Bucks’. Also the threat of Miami is still here, and I honestly have them over the Bucks too."
"as a fellow sixers fan, this is the right take. Embiid has the paint locked down. Better than giannis or AD but switchability is just too important nowadays. Though Joel is a smart defender. He knows his limits and his strengths and defends accordingly"

"I would classify Joel as our dominant presence and number one scoring option, but Ben is definitely the engine.  He decides the pacing, facilitates the shooting, usually calls the plays, and sets the defensive tone.  In fact, I'd say he's the engine, the navigation system, *and* the transmission.  Embiid is the turbo charger, the 4-wheel drive, and both bumpers, hahaha!"
Exactly what I was thinking if you have Jeff Green covering Embiid for a series Joel gonna average 50

1)  Single covering embiid is insanity  2)  No one in the league hates missing free throws the way Joel hates missing free throws.  its hilarious
i think to save time once the opposing team is in the penalty they should automatically be assessed a foul against the center every 3rd possession and joel embiid should shoot two fts

"I don’t want to make the wrong trade with Ben but I honestly want a win-win trade for us and him. He deserves to play four-out. Which, they are capable of but you don’t see them do much, right now Dwight is subbing in for Embiid. But if we get Bjelica as a small-ball 5 Ben should play 39 mpg so we can see him demolish folks. Remember 17-18 when Joel was injured and we won 16 in a row playing four out?"
"In the East the clear favorite is Joel Embiid. The 76ers have the best record in the East, he's making a legit case for being the DPOTY, and without him the 76ers just look bad. Also, stat wise he has them.  In the West it's LeBron James. It's the same old story with LeBron the only difference is that he's playing some good defense this year which helps his case. Also, the Lakers have the best record in the NBA.  So, who's the current MVP front runner? Well, it's LeBron. Best record, playing great both on offense and defense, and with Anthony Davis being quite lackluster by his standards, Lebron is carrying this Lakers team this year. Also, LeBron's impact is proven time and time again."
"Awesome to see Joel and Ben’s relationship develop.. I was a Brett Brown guy throughout the process years but it’s clear that Doc has elevated this team to a new level and it’s nice to see him listen to his guys. This really stuck out to me:   &gt;”Rivers said that when Simmons got going down the stretch, it was actually Embiid who advocated to for the team to run more pick-and-rolls to keep Ben rolling”  https://twitter.com/kyleneubeck/status/1352822125330112512?s=21"
It's not even trash talk when his team wasn't involved.  It was clowning.    How would you feel if Mo Bamba made fun of Joel Embiid for getting eliminated in the playoffs?
I hope Joel Embiid doesn’t cry when the Brooklyn Nets sweep him in the playoffs. Back to back sweeps wouldn’t be ideal.   The next 3-5 years are Brooklyns.

"i think  Joel Embiid  played amazing so far this season. If he keeps it up, maybe there is some MVP talk."
Joel “James Harden” Embiid
"In 2017, the only rookie that looked like they had star potential was a Joel Embiid that only played 31 games due to injury.  Malcolm Brogdon won Rookie of the Year averaging 10 points and 4 assists per game."
"No. DPOY isn't just about counting stats and one fucking game isn't going to suddenly catapult him into contention. Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and Anthony Davis are the front runners and I don't see Capela breaking into the top 4, let alone top 3 for the award."
r/NBA doesn't wanna see Joel Embiid being the best center in the league
"Lol yup, per ESPN play-by-play  2.4		Kemba Walker lost ball turnover (Joel Embiid steals)	110 - 122	 0.0		End of the 4th Quarter	110 - 122"
"Last year I told people that not only has Ben (two years younger than Joel) not hit his prime, but neither has Embiid. I was met with.....let's call it doubt.   I will just say it again. No matter how much external pressure is being put on the Sixers duo, *they are also young stars*. They are not in their early to mid thirties. We don't have to be trying like hell to win now at the cost of the future. They aren't even close to done playing and getting better."
"So is Joel Embiid. Wish the game was closer, that would’ve been a hell of a duel today."
I love Joel Embiid.
"Joel ""James ""Trae Young"" Harden"" Embiid"
"Joel ""James ""Trae Young"" Harden"" Embiid"

Joel Embiid
"Also, have you considered Joel Embiid?"
"to be honest I felt the same way for a while, but after seeing embiid do well in the clutch time and time again I've been convinced that he's capable if he works on some things. his passing 100% needs to improve out of the double, I think he's improved this season but to be honest actually having targets to pass to definitely helps that. I think joel this season also has taken another step, his jumpers are on another level right now.  in terms of other guys I think shake has improved a lot, I honestly believe he's on his way to being the guard that can score on all 3 levels that we've needed desperately. hopefully he keeps getting better and works his way into the starting lineup. guess only time will tell."
[see embiid for it being a rivalry ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2801298-joel-embiid-on-celtics-its-not-a-rivalry-they-always-kick-our-ass)
"The difference is that Embiid is consistently being fouled, minus the swing move that definitely is a Harden play. He's just strong enough that he doesn't get the call unless he plays it up. He learned that and adapted.     A Celtics beat writer [reviewed](https://theathletic.com/2338267/2021/01/22/a-celtics-fans-guide-to-being-mad-about-joel-embiid-free-throw-machine/)  last game and found one foul incorrectly called in Embiid's favor and four that were not called."
  My Celtics have decided the only way to stop Joel Embiid is to just beat his ass
"Can you elaborate on why? He was fouled on that possession.  Your own beat writer [reviewed](https://theathletic.com/2338267/2021/01/22/a-celtics-fans-guide-to-being-mad-about-joel-embiid-free-throw-machine/) the match on Wednesday and found that Embiid received one foul call that was incorrect in his favor and four that were incorrectly *not* called.  Are you upset that Embiid didn't receive an additional net of 3 trips to the line? Yeah, me too."
It was a travel hahah. But if you wanna pull teeth we could go back to Joel Embiid a second foul that Kemba jumped backwards into.
"Joel ""Foul Ming"" Embiid"
"They do this shit with Embiid too, but provide no actual pointers.  “Joel needs to dominate EVERY GAME!”  Great point Shaq and Charles!!!  They watch one Sixers game a month."
1) Joel Embiid   2) Marcus Smart  3) Doc Rivers
"They all got off on the huge high from criticizing Joel Embiid last year and having him react the way he did, essentially saying “those guys are right, and I respect them and their opinions enough to do something about it” that now they just think they gonna do that to everyone and be viewed as the big bro that pushed the young guys to be better. Instead, they come off as haters because they don’t even give real criticism, just “I don’t think you’ve got it” or “it seems like he’s only giving [insert arbitrary percentage] out there.” Who is that helping? The world is crazy. Show some love and give encouragement. These dudes aren’t just playing basketball. They’re trying to lead their peers in a time of turmoil that so many of those old heads ignored because they were making their dollar. It’s wild, to me."
And I thought the T-Wolves fan randomly getting angry at me for saying Joel Embiid was better than Jokic would be the weirdest r/NBA thing to happen to me.
"Hes a more ferocious stronger Joel embiid. No jumper and bad FT but better paint scorer and in his prime a better paint defender. No question he would easily be best big, super dominant"
"First of all, Rudy isn't even close to Shaq's level. Secondly, Shaq would be a better version of Joel Embiid if he played right now. People say Duncan is better than Shaq and honestly it's hard to argue against that, but Shaq in my eyes was always better than him or at least more dominant offensively. Even if Duncan won more championships"
pretend Joel Embiid had about 40 pounds extra muscle and parked his ass in the paint like he should.  That's Shaq on an off-night.
"Shaq is this way when he gets into a beef with this season's flavor of the month big man.   The only guy to ever talk back is Joel Embiid and he also acts humble too so Shaq doesn't go that hard because he likes him.   But Embiid, Howard, Cousins, McGee he's talked a ton of shit about them to their faces and carried on stupid ass beefs.   I'd rather have Gary Payton's version of talking shit, or Baron Davis, or even Chris Webber's enthusiasm. But Shaq can be funny when he's in a good mood."
"It's not the same and you know it.  Gobert is a traditional center. He guards Joel Embiid. He guards Anthony Davis. He guards Jokic. He guards the other elite centers. He's not an athletic freak that can guard multiple positions like Giannis.   Giannis has the build to guard guys like Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler. He's one of the very few guys that can legitimately guard any position. That's so incredibly valuable as demonstrated by the way the Lakers used Davis last year but for some reason, maybe it's coaching idk, Giannis is often not put on these guys in the biggest moments of games.   Jimmy Butler was killing them in must-win games and he never took that assignment, even though he has the wingspan and body to do it. You don't see a problem with that?"
Guards will be James harden starter Kyrie irving Zach lavine Bradly beal starter Trae Young  Forwards  Greek freak starter Kevin Durant starter D.  Saboins Kris Middleton Jayson Tatum  Centers Joel embiid Gucci mane Vuc
Doesn’t have strong fundamentals lmao. Have you ever seen Joel Embiid play basketball?
"Here are their 5 losses @ Cle (no Joel + 2nd of back-to-back) @ brk (no curry + 2nd of back-to-back) vs Den (Covid only 7 players mostly g-leaguers) @ atl (no Simmons, curry, Harris, etc) @ mem (no embiid)"
Volleyball: Joel Embiid
I once saw Joel embiid get sent flying in a collision with Edmond Sumner. Who is a skinny young guard on the pacers.  Its crazy that Sumner is so strong
"Joel. His two way ability puts him over the top for me. As much as Dame can light up the scoresheet, if his shot isn't falling he can't contribute in other ways like Embiid."
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
"Ben will not be a shooter (not this year and most likely not ever), he is not a primary scoring option that is not nor will it ever be his game.  He is a defensive player who is also an exceptional playmaker, able to raise the offensive ratings of lineups he is a part of without scoring in volume with the ability to take it to the rim if you give him an open lane.   Joel Embiid is obviously the best player on the roster, and if he is not 100% then the Sixers have 0 chance to win, just the way it is.  Joel's health and conditioning is not only the most important factor, but is make or break in terms of their prospects."
"No biggie man, I was being intentionally annoying because it's the postgame thread.  I didn't envy the job Theis had last night. I don't think he's big or strong enough to effectively deal with Embiid once he gets deep in the post without leaving room for Joel to earn a call, and now that we have actual shooters and Jo learned how to pass, he was left one-on-one way more than in the past. Seems like it probably sucks!  That Kemba one was so egregious! Matisse had his entire arm along Kemba's for like two full steps on the way to the basket."
Obviously those types of players aren't often available. But they could *try*. They shouldn't go down without a fight.   They could've tried to get Harden. Or back-channeled for Giannis. CP3 was available. Maybe Paul George suddenly grew up as a Warriors fan. Maybe Joel Embiid is tired of playing next to Kangaroo Kidd-Gilchrist. Lowry is an expiring contract.
"My honest opinion?   The Sixers are a contending team, deserving of the number one seed. I have watched every game they have played and am fairly comfortable taking the Sixers, and in particular Embiid, in a seven game series against anyone.   Having said that, it's hard to compare against these teams, because either the Nets were missing key players when they played the Sixers, or the Sixers were missing key players when they played the Bucks.   I think our defense is stifling when they are locked in, and I think neither team has anyone who can stop Embiid one on one. So while KD and Harden and Kyrie will hit shots at an elite level, our shooters can too if they are left open because you have to double Embiid.   Would I be shocked if the Nets just outshoot us in a series? Absolutely not. But we can defend them well and as good as they are they are not immune to good defense, we have seen them struggle at times and they should get dominated on the boards.   As for the Bucks, I don't know if they still play the defense where they pack the paint and leave shooters open but we have had success against that. Giannis will be very disruptive because he can help off of Ben and still get back to Ben and not many other players can do that. Still if anyone can slow down Giannis it's Embiid. But I wouldn't be shocked if they won either. They have played well all year, all of these yes really.   The Sixers are not being respected which is fine, but I will have to see someone beat this Joel Embiid four times out of seven to believe it can be done. And this time we'll have homecourt advantage, unlike against the Raptors."
Seriously. Let's at least wait until the actually have to defend someone. Or have to deal with someone like Joel Embiid.
"Joel Embiid, he moving into top 3 territory IMO"
Hunter will lock up Harris not worried about that at all and I am not worried about Simmons driving into Capela. I am worried about Joel Embiid putting up 60

"Embiid always destroys him, usually ends up with Joel scoring like 35 and drummond fouling out"
It is time for Morey to trade Ben. I feel like Embiid is ready now. Do the trade and go get Kawhi/PG13 or Beal to play with Joel.
So is Joel embiid and every other 76er. Good luck getting smacked the hell out of if y’all make it to the 2nd round lmfao
You don't have to put much effort into slowing down Ben Simmons. Tobias Harris is the Sixers' second best scorer. The Nets are just gonna torch them. Joel Embiid post-ups aren't gonna beat the Nets lmao.

"On/off isn't perfect, but it's not worthless. It's just another data point. It's not ""worthless"". Same with one year RAPM. Using data from other seasons will reduce noise and increase reliability, but at the cost of accuracy. Besides, Embiid beats him in all the multi-year RAPM studies. Obviously, Jokic has improved this season, but so has Embiid, so using data from other seasons isn't going to be perfect. Regardless, none of these hybrid +/- numbers  going to capture the defensive gap. I agree that Jokic would have a strong case even if Joel was fully healthy."

"Bucks fans deserve this one 100%. Too high of expectations last year with Giannis winning a back to back MVP and his point guard being Eric Bledsoe. Now that everyone seems to count them out and having Jrue, they're dangerous. They'd pose a good fight against the Nets, more then Ben ""help I can't shoot"" Simmons, Joel ""damn I'm always hurt"" Embiid and the 76ers."
Imagine this sixers starting lineup:  Ben Simmons  Seth Curry  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  Would be unbeatable
Just because he consistently does shitty things on the court  and you expect those things from him doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be criticized for it. If he can’t get a good look over a guy who is 7-8 inches shorter than him thats a legitimate problem. He should get stronger so he doesn’t need to take fade away jumpers over shooting guards. He doesn’t need to be Joel Embiid to have respectable post moves against shorter guys to at least not shoot 18 foot fadeaways over Reggie Jackson. His inability to get quality looks over shorter guys isn’t something that’s totally out of his control.
I'm just saying that team record isn't the only argument and embiid being a significantly better defender is another argument for him being mvp. Again embiid will probably be 2nd team all defense and jokic won't sniff an all defensive team. It honestly is a fairly large gap in their defensive skill. Embiid is top 2 defensive center in the league and jokic might not even be top 10. With that being said I think jokic is very deserving and joel simply had an unfortunate injury that cost him a legitimate race.
"I don't like our chances but I like them better than against the Bucks and Nets, even as unstoppable as Joel Embiid is."
"“So in Kigali, there were scouts in the stands from around the globe, poised to find the next Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid or Pascal Siakim.”  Hmmm, one of these is not like the other…  Great story, though."
"Kawhi has been riding his defensive reputation for a long time now. He’s still incredible one on one but he routinely falls asleep off ball, makes poor defensive reads, and generally plays with pretty low effort on the defensive end these days.  Even in Toronto we would actually hide him a lot during the playoff run. He was guarding JJ Reddick down the stretch against the Sixers, when the other 4 guys were Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and Joel Embiid.  I really don’t think he has it in him to be a stopper for an entire game"
"The nba 100% never reports weights correctly. Look at the ufc heavyweight champion, Francis Ngannou. Last fight he had, he weighed in at 264, 1 pound below the limit. Looking on Google, Joel Embiid is reported as 280 pounds.   Look at a picture of the two side by side. You're telling me Joel is 7+ inches taller, almost equally as built, and only 10-15 pounds heavier than Ngannou? Get out of here. I think you can realistically add 20 pounds to every reported weight from the nba."

Lebron did the same exact play on Joel embiid earlier this season.
"Joel ""Do a 180"" Embiid"
"LeBron did worse to Joel Embiid this season and wasn't even given a flagrant, yall are too soft. Not a chance he gets suspended"
lebron did much worse to joel embiid just saying
"I mean I'm high on Bam too, dude is just having a bad series who knows why, but really, above Joel Embiid?"
"Honestly after the playoffs last year I don't think it's crazy to say Bam is better than Joel. Obviously after a season where the Heat have shit the bed over and over again and Embiid is a MVP candidate, it seems silly. But can we shit on them for not being time travelers?"
And joel embiid
Joel embiid on Davis Harris on lebron and Ben can easily score on Lakers point guards
"Bam has not a single season better than Joel's worst season. It's not hindsight. Joel was DEMONSTRABLY better and you didn't need this season to slap your forehead and go ""oh yeah. Joel Embiid is really great"". And only a magical playoff run skewed perspective for bam."
Uh Joel embiid why is this a question? Lol
"It's definitely ben Simmons lol, can't wait for the nets to sweep the fraud sixers and for Joel embiid to go to Miami"
@Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid would talk the refs into giving that fan a technical
Never underestimate Joel Embiid
"I don’t want to make this a “rim protector vs perimeter defender” argument, but a “What can Rudy do defensively vs what can Ben Simmons do Defensively” argument. Even if you have Gobert as the best rim protector in the league, you can ask Jakob Poeltl, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and some other rim protecting bigs to do what Gobert does and they would be able to do a good enough job doing it (not on the level that Gobert can). My point is that centers that protect the paint, play in drop coverage and contest shots at the rim are more common than guys that can guard all 5 positions like Ben Simmons can. There isn’t anything that guys like him and Draymond can’t do defensively and that defensive profile is extremely rare"
Imagine having a guy like Joel Embiid on your team then act like a dumbass causing you to never see him and his team live at your home arena ever again. Fucking idiot
"Joel Embiid is a better defender than Gobert when he wants to be. Gobert doesn't have great help defense, unlike Simmons who has Embiid and Green or Thybulle at times. It is a tough call...Thybulle is the best defender in the NBA though so it doesn't matter much"
"I'm biased so I'm obviously gonna take the Sixers. But at the very least I like that matchup a lot better than I do the Nets.   Put Embiid on Giannis, Ben on Middleton, Harris on Lopez, and Green on Holiday. That's a tough defense to score against. Although those are good offensive players in Milwaukee so it's not like it'd be easy.   On the other side the Bucks (like most teams) have no one that can guard Embiid one on one. So you either get cooked at Embiid's leisure, or double and give up wide open threes. Ben guarded by Giannis will honestly be the toughest matchup for Ben in the entire playoffs no matter how far he gets. He is faster than Giannis, but not fast enough to matter that often especially with Giannis' length at the rim. He won't be able to bully Giannis at all. And Giannis will be able to help off of him and double Joel and do a better-than-most job at recovering when the ball goes to Ben.   But that's if they play defense the way I think they should and not the way they do. Usually they pack the paint and let shooters have what they will. If they do this then we will shoot very well and Embiid will still score a bunch facing up."
"I mean I guess if instead of putting Joel Embiid, Danny Green, Seth Curry, and Tobias Harris (all great shooters) we just put five Ben Simmons' out there."
"I'm not talking about career fwiw, I know Luka is the choice there. But Luka hasn't nearly established himself as a generational talent at this point imo.  Let's see him make it out of the west (or at least round one) before we start with that talk.    As for Embiid's duds [Gasol is his kryptonite](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marc-gasol-is-joel-embiids-kryptonite/), by far the most effective Joel stopper in the league, and the sixers were still +89 in that series with Embiid on the floor and -107 with him off it.  Horford is #2 on that list among big minutes opposition so Embiid has really had a rough slate of opponents at the position.  Add the sixers spacing issues and Luka's potential redundancy in that most teams already have a lead ball-handler and for a game tomorrow I think most teams, especially the really good ones, would benefit more from adding Embiid."

Oh man king troll Joel Embiid vs Knicks fans would be DELICIOUS
Embiid eats regular junk food not premium shit so it in fact doesn't help you at all that a guy with the 100 million dollar contract eats whatever  https://www.sportscasting.com/76ers-star-joel-embiid-used-to-have-the-worst-junk-food-filled-diet/

"Joel Embiid: ""Thank you ☺️"""
"Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples, a wide butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Joel Embiid. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Cameroon. So I have one question. Why are you here? -Dirk Nowitzki"

Joel “power bottom” Embiid
Im sorry Joel Embiid is just a 3rd string center in the NBA at 18 years old. So he is the back up back up
Joel Embiid says otherwise
"Joel ""The Kyle Lowry of Centers"" Embiid"
"&gt;You want to talk shit, talk shit. It's alright, but next game it's going to be tougher  Airplane Joel Embiid agrees"
Phily and bucks are both super scary.   If we had more time/cohesion Id feel a lot better.   Bucks match up scary well w us defensively.   Joel Embiid is the Nets kryptonite.   Its not an easy road to the finals by any means.
"Beverley can be a good defender and still be mismatched with Luka, especially in small ball situations where there's no center in the lineup to play help. Joel Embiid would absolutely destroy Jrue Holiday 1v1 but that doesn't mean Holiday is a bad defender."
&gt; You gotta do a 180   What does Joel Embiid have to do with this?
Joel Embiid.
"Joel ""do a 180"" embiid"
"Per [NBA.com](https://NBA.com):  &amp;#x200B;  Embiid: 28.5 ppg in 31.1 mpg  &amp;#x200B;  Jokic: 26.4 ppg in 34.6 mpg  &amp;#x200B;  It's obvious that efficient scoring + high minutes &gt; efficient scoring + lower minutes, and I'm on-board that Jokic is amazing on offense (better than Joel).  My issue is when people say that Embiid isn't ""anywhere close"" to Jokic when he's actually, quite literally, the better scorer.    (and before a bunch of randos decide to downvote me: I also understand that assists are a thing, playmaking is a thing, and their roles on offense are totally different.)"
Joel Embiid played volleyball
"&gt;Shaq is the funny one with the old fashioned takes  lol, people laugh AT Shaq not with him, like when he legitimately thought Phoenix was closer than the moon. That ain't no intentional joke. Shaq's best moments on the show have been him laughing at Chuck's jokes.   I've also yet to hear Shaq give any decent basketball analysis. It's usually something really generic and poorly worded like ""Joel Embiid needs 30 points and 10 rebounds if Sixers want to win"". Anyone can give that surface level basketball take. Shaq just gets paid millions to do it on TV."
"Are you really trying to compare Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid to Bam Adebayo? They are tier 1 players, Adebayo ain’t. It’s obvious that they will get criticized more."
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
There's no fucking way Joel Embiid could do that
Did LeBron not load manage? Did Kawhi not load manage? Were Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving’s injuires not contact injuries? Did Harden not take 15% of the season off to go to the club?  Jaylen Brown hurt is hand. Anthony Davis always picks up injuries. Joel Embiid always picks up injuries.   Injuries are a reality.
The 76ers haven't swept them can't be that absurd. They beat the Knicks it can't be that absurd. Joel embiid is only shooting 45% from the floor. Use Stats to prove me wrong
collins is 23 in his 4th season and tobias harris is 28 is his 8th season and he is only a slightly better player. Speaking of Joel Embiid you know how many games he has missed due to injury?
The ratings are going to tank if the best players are getting hurt. Lebron out the first round is not good for ratings. Kyrie and harden out is not good for ratings. Joel embiid meniscus tear keeping him out and limiting his play is bad for ratings. Kawhi being out... this is just fucked. Long term view needs to be evaluated for the future.
What makes you say that lol. Ben Simmons is wasting whatever prime Joel Embiid has left.
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
Joel Embiid will be the last man standing. As expected.
"He's a late bloomer not only as a star but as a basketball player, and he doesn't seem to get past it. But so is Joel Embiid, and look how much his skillset evolved in the last 4 years"
"Ah yes, everyone knows my 1st team All-NBA ballot was Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, CP3, and Donte DiVencenzo"
"https://www.nba.com/news/nba-tells-teams-rules-will-be-relaxed-for-vaccinated-persons   &gt;The contact tracing part of the new rules will be a major benefit. Being flagged by contact tracing has been an issue for many players this season including Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, both of whom had to miss the All-Star Game and the start of the season’s second half because a barber that they visited tested positive — but they did not. Had they been fully vaccinated, they would not have had to miss any time even after being around someone who tested positive for COVID-19."
"If healthy yes, nobody is beating them:   Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid"
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
"Joel Embiid is the biggest character in the nba I don't know how you don't include him  Blake Griffin is funny and a good actor, irrelevant that he is past his prime"
"The first names that come to mind are Jabari Parker, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Joel Embiid"
*Breaking: Joel Embiid has explosive diarrhea*
"Yeah Duncan was no where nearly as bad as Giannis at Free Throw shooting. He’s basically a career 70% FT shooter, that’s actually good for a big man. But you are absolutely correct, people don’t realize how vital this is but LeBron came into the league with an acceptable jumper it just was inconsistent. Another aspect that gets looked over with LeBron is that he came into the league 245 pounds so he already somewhat of a grown man body (I know it’s crazy calling 6’8 245 “somewhat” of a grown man body but look at him now lol), Giannis came in at 190, never really developed a jumper &amp; then added A LOT of muscle mass quickly which is why he has no fluidity in his jumper &amp; he looks like he gears up to shoot. The perimeter dreams have to go &amp; he needs to go see Hakeem &amp; Tim Duncan every summer into he has their footwork &amp; bag completely down. Also he’s so foolish for saying he doesn’t wanna work with other players in the summer, bruh you need it lmaooo Joel Embiid could teach him something."
"Bad luck and dumb sellection process, mate. As both Joker and Embiid are regarded and voted in as Cs, you are obligated to put the league MVP in the 1st team. Unfortunately, that leaves Joel for 2nd team..."
"Turner is definitely switchable and Joel embiid is really the only one who completely dominates Turner.  Even if all he did was rim protect and wasn’t a good shooter, that’s still extremely valuable for the Pacers. Turner’s lead the league in blocks for a while, and his presence in the paint goes beyond just his blocks. The amount of times a guard will go into the paint and turn away because Turner is in there is extremely valuable.  And to say levert isn’t a better playmaker and shit creator than Gordon Hayward is just flat out wrong."
" ""Giannis, you are larger, faster, and stronger than everyone on the planet except for maybe Joel Embiid. If you shoot another jumper, I will have Bobby Portis immediately punch your brother on the bench.""  ""Everyone else, if you spend more than 3 second standing around the three point line without setting a screen for someone else, I will sign your sibling, put them on the bench, and then have Bobby Portis punch them."""
"Why is Giannis playing like he’s Joel Embiid or KD rather than Russel Westbrook  Does he not know yet that he’s long Westbrook?  Actually, Westbrook still doesn’t know that he’s Westbrook. Hmm."
"You have a good point about Embiid still playing but let's be clear, DeAndre Hunter and Joel Embiid aren't the same impact. Hunter is much closer to say, Matisse Thybulle. Embiid being limited is a much bigger impact than Hunter not playing at all.  But, to be clear, that doesn't take anything away from the Hawks' two wins or make the rest of the series mean any less. They are playing great. Some teams are always more banged up than others this time of year. It's life. No one takes anything from the Raptors in 2019 or the Warriors in 2015 because multiple opponents were not 100%."
Just a tribute to his favorite foul baiter Joel Embiid
"No doubt, same thing why Joel Embiid sometimes shoot from the outside, so Simmons can drive inside"
"At one point on MyCareer on 2k I had me (SG), Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis lmao"
Yea why's Joel Embiid there then?
27 people really voted Joel Embiid 1st Team as a **forward** lmao. Embiid hasn't played PF for a single second in his career.
what about Joel Embiid tho?
"I just don’t understand how anyone can still defend this, like both him and embiid been in the league for how long and the excuses keep piling up, the process might be a failure sometime in the future if Ben doesn’t learn how to shoot/be a great score and if Joel stays soft and injury prone."
"He doesn't have to go vegetarian like Chris Paul he just needs to stop eating Big Macs on the bench. I put him in the same dietary category as Nikola jokic before this last 18 months,  a diet that isn't good for anybody but particularly not a professional athlete. Cases of Snickers or bags of Big Macs are not snack foods, if you got Joel embiid to stop snacking on the  things other people consider meals then he probably loses some weight but really not that much.  He would get better results from just cardio training because really his problem is stamina not weight"
"&gt;	Did he have Joel Embiid next to him to score for him? Or Tobias Harris averaging over 20?  You’re not getting the point which is that Embiid had an off night (and he’s injured) while ben had 10 **shot attempts**, made half of em and fucked up crucial free throws.   He’s a poor man’s Draymond green but a lot worse"
"You see what the Sixers are not when Embiid is going, but when he's not playing at an all-NBA level. Trae Young has a great career ahead of him and the Hawks are a fun story, but Philly still should have won last night even with Joel having one of his worst games ever. Simmons just can't produce scores unless it's via wide-open dunk."
"Joel ""foul merchant"" Embiid"
"The odds of the Nets Winning and KD being finals MVP being the exact same seems very odd to me.  If Kyrie is out James Harden will be handling most of the playmaking and will have to play amazing for the Nets to win. If you think KD is more likely that's fine but Harden is a very legit candidate as well.    They are treating KD as as much of a clear favorite for his teams FMVP as they are Kawhi, Embiid and Giannis. It's a lot easier for me to imagine what a James Harden FMVP looks like than PG, Khris or Joel considering he will almost certainly be creating more offense than KD through points and assists.   Implied Odds:  Nets Win: 21%  KD MVP: 18%"
So why did you talk down to that person when he said Joel Embiid was hurt?
Did he have Joel Embiid next to him to score for him? Or Tobias Harris averaging over 20?
"Yeah I agree for Tobi and Horford, but Ben was gonna get the max either way. And since he's a draft pick we have his bird rights, so really doesn't matter how much he makes from our perspective. I doubt Embiid cares either lol. At some point 32 mil and 36 mil doesn't make a difference. Joel is getting paid the normal max, he reaches all the games played thresholds I believe."
I think it’s cuz he mainly shot jumpers but it’s hard to get to the rim when Adams and Zion are on the court. I’d say he was definitely the most skilled playmaker on the team and he’d probably benefit with the spacing Joel Embiid provides as well
"Clint Capela On Joel Embiid: ""Whenever you ~~wear him out~~ tear his meniscus, everything becomes tougher for him. When the ~~fatigue comes in~~ meniscus gets torn, it's a different ballgame."""
"Sixers superstar Joel Embiid is still playing yet this series is tied 2-2. The Hawks best defensive player Deandre Hunter is OUT for the rest of the season. Literally no pundits, experts or analyst mention this crucial point. The Hawks are hobbled yet somehow the series is tied 2-2 with the so called untouchable Sixers..."
"Joel Embiid on game 4 loss: ""There's no excuses, I got to be better"""
Joel Embiid is also 10 years away too depending where his injuries take him. He is hilarious too.
"The problem is that his offensive arsenal when he doesn''t have the ball is pretty lackluster too, he is super athletic and has good touch, but that's pretty much it.  As a side note, i know that OP didn't intend this, but LeBron could've literally had Joel Embiid, when he left Cleveland in 2018 he could've joined the Sixers and it was on the board for a while, he just chose L.A, which even though he won a championship there, i will always think it was a mistake.  LeBron, Simmons and Embiid would've trounced Kawhi and the Raptors in 2019."
"most want to win down the line  1. Atlanta Hawks 2. Los Angeles Clippers 3. Philadelphia 76ers 4. Milwaukee Bucks 5. Phoenix Suns 6. Brooklyn Nets 7. Utah Jazz  From the Southeast, then it's basically by players, I enjoy Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid/Tobias Harris more than the others."
Y’all Hawks fans are acting like y’all can’t be real with yourselves. Embiid went 0-7 in the third missing layups and simple midrange shots that he makes 50+ % of. He was laboring and walking slow asf prior to last night he dropped 40s and 30s on Capela. Don’t kid yourself like he can guard him. It’s talking shit because you wait until you think things are in your favor. Where were the Words after he hit you with 40/39 back to back? Exactly! Dude missed layups and dunks when he saw Joel coming scary ass.
"Dude the hawks have been getting destroyed all series with no calls.  Even last night then called some bs on embiid. You breath on joel, foul!  I just wanna see it called the same for both teams every game."
"its not really that sixers shot poorly outside of joel embiid. its more like the entire offense really on joel embiid to be dominant down low, so if he cant even make a field goal, then the whole offense is out of funk. its not like hawks found some way to miraculously shut down the most dominant big man in the league that has abused every other defense he has played. that was him playing with an injured and then getting worn down after getting knocked down to the ground time and time again in the 3rd. he was exhausted at that point and doc did nothing to save him. as for you saying the hawks shooting is as good as it can be, that can easily be attributed to sixers perimeter defense. simmons and tisse both made all defensive teams for a reason and they disrupt any around the 3pt line. even trae young has had his fair share of woes with them this series."
"you ever see Joel Embiid play, he's in the series too. how about you...OPEN your eyes :)"
"If anyone remembers the movie Anger Management, a guy in a sixers jersey was listening to the game and when a sixer missed I wanna say a layup, he was screaming what I was screaming when Joel missed that layup. ""YOU GOTTA DUNK THAT SHIT!!""  WHAT WAS EMBIID DOING THIS WHOLE GAME?!"
Joel “missalot” embiid
Is this the dunk that Joel Embiid was referring to when he stopped in the press conference?

2 Offensive Superstars &gt; 1 Offensive Superstar  imo.  Embiid + Trae will be filthy. Joel has never played with a really good PG in a P&amp;R situation.  Embiid + Trae + Bogi &gt; Embiid + Ben + Tobi  Obviously Sixers dwarfs Hawks in terms of defence but Embiid himself is the most important part of the defence so put him on the Hawks and they improve in that regard too.
Joel Embiid and Trae Young would like to have a word with you

"I’m not salty about the series or Joel embiid. The salt is there, but it’s more so on the entire league full of bitch ass “entertainers” worried more about the refs than the actual sport being played. Trae does it. Lou does it. Shit it’s part of the league, and it’s the worst part of the league. But never in my life have I seen someone pander to the refs more than 7’3 Joel embiid, and yea, while my 6’1 point guard takes all the shit from everybody in the league, being the face of “foul baiting”, it’s gunna crystallize some fuckin salt."
"You know who has a meniscus tear? Deandre hunter. Joel embiid doesn’t get the injury pass for his performance today if he’s averaging 36.5 minutes and 20 shots a game. I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole injury thing is just a way to get better treatment from refs. Idc I’ll take the downvotes, Joel embiid is playing at full strength and just SHIT THE BED. WWE ass dude."

"The problem is that it doesn't selectively apply to any year, but is a recurring theme, so it needs to be discounted. There have been major injuries changing the playoff landscape in most recent years.   * 2020 Lakers - Bam, Jimmy, and Dragic all get injured in the first half of game 1.  * 2019 Raptors - Kevin Durant plays 12 minutes in the finals before his Achilles explodes. Klay Thompson misses time an eventually loses his ACL in game 6. Joel Embiid also has a mysterious illness in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. * 2018 Warriors - Chris Paul's hamstring explodes in the Western Conference finals. * 2017 Warriors - The Warriors zaza Kawhi after getting blownout in game 1 of the WCF. * 2016 Cavs - Draymond gets suspended for caressing LeBron's testicle zone and Andrew Bogut breaks his leg. * 2015 Warriors - Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in game 1 of the finals and Kelly Olynyk breaks Kevin Love's shoulder. * 2014 Spurs - Our last real champions."
"I agree but this sub will tell you Embiid is better because he can shoot and Giannis has ""no bag"" yet he has outscored Kevin Durant in 3/4 games while grabbing 11 rebounds and playing insane defense. Giannis is a better player then Joel and it isn't close imo. He may be less skilled offensively but his a better all around player"

"That is interesting since you have a post in r/eagles. How weird that you're a fan of one Philly sports team, stanning for Joel Embiid but have no skin in the game for the 76ers. Almost seems like bullshit!"
"Joel Embiid couldn't get any lift on his shots in the second half. He's playing through an injury, and his teammates didn't help him enough to win game four in Atlanta."
"Welp, Clint Capela dunked on Joel Embiid in the playoffs.  Time to start ""EMBIID GETS PLAYED OFF THE COURT IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!"" slander?"
Joel Embiid was fantastic for the Hawks.

Hot take: player struggles to defend some of the best eve players in his position.   Up next: why does myles turner struggle so much with Joel embiid
"In all fairness, they had picked Joel Embiid that draft."
"If you played that series 100 times, the Sixers would have won it 90 times.  The Sixers choked away games by missing point blank shots that they make 90% of the time.  For example, the Sixers dominated Game 4, but in the second half they blew a 17 point lead, Joel Embiid went 0-12, missing several layups and point blank shots.  And that doesn't include all the missed free throws (and not just from Simmons).  Same thing in Game 5 when they blew a 26 point lead and didn't score in the final 6 minutes of the game.  The Hawks got lucky for the Sixers to play so badly.  The Hawks didn't win that series anywhere near as much as the Sixers lost it.    And the Sixers match up far better against the Bucks than the Hawks did.  The Bucks simply aren't going to be able to bully the Sixers in the paint like they did the Hawks."
"KD never looked like a 7 footer to me, merely he was the honest man over a field of liars.  For example Cousins is 6' 9"" (a visibly undersized C when it comes to height), so no wonder that KD is taller (over 6' 9"" but slightly lest than 6' 10"")  As for Giannis he has an inch over Durant, so that would make him a bit below 6' 11"". He is no true 7 footer neither, then again true 7 footers are rare even in the NBA. Joel Embiid for example was measured as 6' 11.75"".  If even him is not a true 7 footer I don't think many are. Prolly the two Dallas Bigs, I can't think of any other."
"I don’t have any of my own to speak of, but my dad insists that Joel Embiid is the second coming of Willis Reed and he dismisses stretch fives as “Robert Horry types”."
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
"&gt; Obviously, when Joel (Embiid) got hurt, that was the game that we ended up winning. And we felt like we should have won the next game, but they just wanted it a little bit more than we did. And Joel didn’t even play that game. But at the same time we kind of exposed the move of fouling Ben (Simmons), putting him on the line a few times. Granted, I think in our series he actually made a few. So, we had to go away from that instead of just giving away free points. But they were two totally different series, two totally different teams. Ben was more or less aggressive in our series, the first couple games, and then it kind of died down and trickled down from there. Atlanta was a good team, too. They played hard. They have a lot of young pieces over there who are really versatile. They’re not just a one-dimensional team. It was very tough. Joel had to do a lot."
In the number of dirty plays? No.  In the potential severity? Yes.  Two prime examples that I’ve seen in this thread: His push on Shaun Livingston in the finals and his push on Joel Embiid earlier this year.
I mean he's not Brook Lopez or Joel Embiid. He's pretty strong but doesn't have that huge base that some centers do. Thats why I called him fairly skinny not incredibly skinny.
"But when Lebron pushes Embiid out of the air to injure him because Joel was beating him in the MVP race, nobody says anything"
Their teams love them and their are plenty of other international players in the NBA who love them. Again it’s like we are trying to perpetuate a narrative where only American players opinions matter. These guys won MVP and DPOY and the league has influence in the ability for these players to win. Don’t forget Joel Embiid was a front runner for MVP another international player.
Not to mention Joel Embiid and Seth Curry 🤷‍♂️
2018 Joel in the mask still played 30+ minutes a game in the playoffs. What the Cavs needed and GS didn’t have was a big man. JaVale McGee isn’t stopping 10% Embiid. And 10% Embiid is still a dominant force at the rim.
Just confirming if you mean this year's Joel Embiid and not 2018 Joel.
Joel Embiid wins that series for the Cavs. No one on Golden State would have been able to guard him and his rim protecting would allow the Cavs to guard the 3 point line a little tighter. Just my opinion.
"Joel embiid and lillard definitely sound pretty interesting to watch!  Then again, a rock would be better than simmons at this point"
Dame isn’t moving to Philadelphia for Ben Fucking Simmons. Just like Joel Embiid isn’t going to Portland for CJ Fucking McCollum.
"Joel Embiid sees triple teams all the time, what is this?"
Joel Embiid
"&gt; those two along with a solid supporting cast can do it in the East.                No they can't, not against a fully healthy Nets. And if you want to talk injury prone and the unlikelihood of the Nets being healthy, just look at Joel. Tell me, who would you bet your house on - KD+Harden+Kyrie or Embiid+Dame+Tobias? Nets have the two best players out of that six and the Sixers have easily the worst. Nets in four."
"Yeah, superstar duo Joel Embiid and Shake Milton"
"Dame isn't dumb, there's no point in requesting a trade to a team in a slightly better situation than Portland, if you are going to leave, leave to somewhere that's actually much better.  Put Dame with Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris or with Steph and Klay and that's a superteam."
Joel Embiid and Damian Lillard has a nice ring to it
"Everyone not named Joel for me.   Maxey, Thybulle, milton, could throw in korkmaz as a sign and trade if they wanted (sixers have his bird rights).   I suspect any trade would end up being a 3 or 4 team deal with a ton of dudes getting moved, though.   But yea, anyone not named embiid and all future picks are on the table for Lillard.   We saw this last post season that philly's title hopes are tied entirely to Embiid's prime (which if we're being honest is a narrow window).   Prime lillard + prime embiid is probably the best pairing we can hope for."
Joel embiid
Joel Embiid and Isaiah Joe
Healthy Joel Embiid is the best player in the NBA.
"Joel embiid, maybe Tobias Harris."
Joel Embiid. Please fuck.
Joel Embiid
"Okay, it could be stupid, but Joel Embiid factually cried when they lost to the Raptors. So it’s not incorrect. And it’s kind of funny seeing a grown ass man cry over a basketball game, you got to admit. I’m sorry you’re so sensitive about this"
"I mean without Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris, the Sixers are lucky to get the 6 or 7 seed"
He has not played next to KAT         Edit: TIL the “stretchiest” 5 in the league is paint dominant Joel embiid
"He has Joel Embiid. There’s not many centers that shoot better than him, and Joel was more than willing to stay on the perimeter at times and Ben still couldn’t capitalize."
"Joel/Dame/Tobi/Seth is an ECF favorite, and Embiid is the perfect guy to put with dame. Fantastic defense, can score 30-40 but doesn’t have to, top top 8-12 players that would complement each other great."
"My friend saying we should've drafted Dante Exam over Joel Embiid on draft night  My roommates dad saying three months ago we should keep Ben Simmons and trade Embiid  ESPN ranking Bam Adebayo over Joel Embiid less than a year ago  Paul Pierce saying he was a better perimeter shooter than Klay Thompson is  On r/sixers last off-season I was downvoted for saying Devin Booker is better than Ben Simmons. Their reasoning for why Ben is better was literally just that he plays defense  My GFs brother, a Mavericks fan, saying at the time of trade that they got the better player in the Josh Richardson/Seth Curry trade  My friend draft night saying that Luka Doncic was gonna bust"
My friend thought we should trade joel embiid for Jordan Clarkson at one point
Joel Embiid hadn't even touched a basketball at that age.
"I personally disagree with the only 1 non shooter philosophy in the modern league. Teams have become so good at rotating that often teams can't move the ball fast enough in the playoffs to take advantage of help defence. Smart cutting and interior playmaking can counter this (in theory).  Ideally teams would run 4 out with two pure shooters, 1 finishing big, and one all round player (shooting/passing/slashing) but thats just not realistic these days and most teams are going to have holes, especially if they want to be competitive on both ends.  While I wouldn't want to see Simmons/Noel share the court for 48 minutes (asking wayyyy to much of Dame), I think - providing Simmons recaptures some playmaking/slashing form - it can work very effectively in spurts.  I can't find the breakdown someone in our sub did, but last year when Ben was first starting to be used consistently as a roll man, he was very good at it and always made great decisions, as well as getting some easy baskets.  The ringer did a solid breakdown on it https://www.theringer.com/2019/5/9/18537564/play-ben-simmons-at-center-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid  but it doesn't have the video breakdown that our sub did."
Two years of chip contending and still have Joel Embiid afterwards when Lowry/Demar decline &gt;&gt;&gt; a bunch of second round exits
"I really think separating from Joel Embiid may help out Ben Simmons mental game. No hate to Joel, he is definitely one of the top big men in the game today and his leader ship is apparent especially with the rookies. But something tells me that Simmons needs someone with a different leadership style and someone to set an example to get him back on track"
"It's worse than that.  Joel Embiid - genuine superstar, one of the best players in the league - is sick of covering for the weaknesses of the cowardly little bitch Ben Simmons.  There is a significant risk, if Ben stays on the team, that Embiid will demand a trade to go play with Jimmy Buckets in Miami.  Therefore, lowballing teams prepared to pay Ben Simmons salary could have disasterous implications for Philly."
Aight he wasn't seen as the next goat lets chill lol  Joel Embiid was more hyped talent wise but his injury concerns derailed that
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
Is he really a good offensive player tho?  Fox aint exactly Steph Curry from deep but atleast you can play him in the final minutes of a game 7  That lack of even effort to shoot should immediately disqualify Ben from being a good offensive player but the assists are also incredibly overrated. They're all from transition passes to Joel Embiid or wide open shooters that really anyone can make. You never see him do much in a half court setting in terms of playmaking
&gt; Excluding Joel Embiid and Giannis
Christ how hard is it to understand the Sixers are not trying to build a team for the future. They have Joel Embiid a top 5 player in his prime RIGHT NOW. We don’t have the luxury to wait on picks to convey 3/4/5 years in the future. The kings package would be great if we were trying to blow it up and rebuild but that’s not what we are doing. I swear people see picks and assume that’s great. We are trying to win now not after embiids prime is over.
Joel Embiid: we lost the game when simmons passed up that dunk  Doc Rivers: I don’t think Ben Simmons can be a starter on a championship contender  Darryl Morey: one all star please!
"&gt;	Drafting Okafor over Porzingis, when you already just drafted Embiid?  This is super revisionist history. At the time they weren’t sure if Joel would be healthy. Came out of college hurt, had surgery missed his rookie season, then got hurt right before the next season too and missed the whole thing. He missed two and a half years of basketball and has said he considered just giving up on basketball."
"&gt; Plus the human body just isn't designed to be that big.  This is a really weird take and I'm not saying that it's wrong or right. I don't know. But his body is his body. When you say ""the human body isn't meant to be that big"" its like you're saying a humans body doesn't adapt to that particular humans size. For example, Joel Embiid doesn't wear a size 9 shoe. His hands aren't the size of the hands of a person that is 5'10. Everything on his body is proportionate to his size so what does it mean when people say ""the human body isn't meant to be that size""? Just seems kind of innacurate to me. The human body is meant to be whatever size it is."
I don’t see the point of getting a bunch of picks (unless you flip them.) Joel Embiid is 27 - this is their window right now.
This is a huge stretch. That team had Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler and Tobias. Ben Simmons was a non factor on the court when it really mattered
Joel Embiid.
Everyone though that he was a forward. Then Brett Brown announced that he was going to be a point guard a few months after the draft.   https://www.libertyballers.com/2016/12/1/13810168/brett-brown-ben-simmons-sixers-point-guard-return-from-injury-joel-embiid

"Giannis absolutely earns his free throws, but bruh embiid do be floppy over every little thing. The James harden of centers (from a James harden and Joel embiid fan)"
"Firstly, you don't know me or anybody else on here. You don't think doctors, lawyers, firefighters log on to reddit to let off some steam? Or you just think that athletes by default work harder than everybody else?  Secondly, I'm not looking down on anybody, I'm just stating an opinion.  No doubt Steven Adams works incredibly hard. That has nothing to do with the discussion here. I'm not talking about hard work, I'm talking about assertiveness.  Be honest, do you really think that Steven Adams has achieved everything that he could've been in the NBA? You don't think that if he had've had a different approach to his role that he could've had a different career trajectory?  What about Ben Simmons then? Is he doing absolutely everything in his power to be the best version of himself that he can be? I sure don't think so, and apparently Doc Rivers, Joel Embiid, Danny Green and Daryl Morey agree with me.  But maybe those guys don't realise the amount of work it takes either, and we're all just being unfair to these guys and looking down on them."
[In the words of the great Joel Embiid](https://imgur.com/gallery/YUmV4Hr)  USA 🇺🇸 🦅 🇺🇸 USA
Matches the eyes test. Suns need to get on the Marc Gasol-Joel embiid plan and match their minutes up completely. Giannis is playing extremely well off ball tho so it’s not a perfect solution but anything else is prob just not gonna work
Bubble was that singular Joel Embiid ad and the same damn State Farm ads this playoffs. The ones that are funny and quirky the first time and get progressively more annoying the more times you have to hear them.
And they did it without famous Nigerians Steve Nash and Joel Embiid!
I’m shocked people can’t see how Lowry would elevate the play of everyone on the 76ers and are arguing for a one dimensional shooter.   Seth is a nice piece but Kyle Lowry elevates the game of everyone around him. I don’t think ppl understand how well he would fit alongside Joel Embiid.

It was worse than Joel Embiid and Joel sat out 10 games
"The crazy thing about Robert Williams aside from being an advanced stats darling, or his stellar passing especially throwing lobs to others, ability to change the trajectory of almost anyone's shot, and change the time continuum. He's consistently one of the best shot blockers in the game.  He's ranked 9th in the league with 91 blocks per game.  This was something I'm always in awe of, because I was looking at his statistics on BBall-Reference two days ago, and he's ahead of players like Embiid, Giannis, and Jarrett Allen. All players well known for their defensive capabilities/weakside or shot blocking help.  And he's done this in 985 minutes.  |1. Rudy Gobert|2187 MPG|190 blocks| |:-|:-|:-| |2.

"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."

"Luka ""For sure"" Doncic.  Joel ""Like I said"" Embiid.  Devin ""Preparation meets opportunity"" Booker."
"This trade all comes down to the angle you're going for.  IMO the most valuable of the 4 players for the long term is Mitchell.  Embiid clearly the best of the 4 right now, but the thought of having to pay 29-33 year old Joel Embiid a supermax contract makes me cringe.  Quite frankly I don't really know why either team would want to do this.  Gobert is offensively limited but that's way less of an issue at the Center spot than Simmons at the PG.  And really, the Jazz were right there this year - they just ran out of gas in the postseason - it happens.  Meanwhile the Sixers need to trade Simmons, but why Embiid?  They can make their team better right now while building around Embiid as all the pieces are there except Simmons/PG.  The right deal this offseason for Simmons makes them legit contenders instantly."
"If I’m considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D’Angelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I’m not forgetting anyone"
Ben Simmons = instant Joel Embiid double team
"Wilt Chamberlain  Basically a faster, stronger Joel Embiid growing up with modern nutrition, coaching, and weight training."
Joel Embiid is about as smart as a cup of dog sperm so even if it was possible he wouldn’t know.
"I can give you other examples then that are more comparable, like KAT is a more efficient scorer than Shaq, which again means jackshit, Joel Embiid is also more efficient than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, can you notice the trend?  Looking at efficiency while ignoring how the rules have changed, how analytics have impacted the sport  and how much easier it is to play offense today is disingenuous AND ignorant.  Which is why saying that player X is more efficient than player Y when they didn't play in the same timeframe or had similar roles within an offense is the most useless piece of information one can give."
&gt; He lost the team well before the beginning of the year two seasons ago.      These quotes are from May 2019:   https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-stars-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-jimmy-butler-defend-brett-brown-job-security-rumors-swirl/
"Joel Embiid. The footwork, defense, and soft touch. Then also his ability to play on the fans emotions. A complete show."
"Man, in raw talent, that Kansas freshman class had Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid. It’s a shame that Joel couldn’t stay healthy. Wiggins came in as the consensus #1 player, but by the end, every Kansas fan knew Embiid was the better talent, which pretty much meant he was the most talented player in the country. Honestly not surprised that he’s this good today. He came in with no hype compared to Wiggins and just blew everyone away."
"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz  ""It's a normal collar, find a new slant."" Lmaooo"
"He isn't the only player who shoots layups exclusively.      Some notable players he's more efficient than (by TS): John Collins, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, etc. Note that TS also accounts for the efficiency of 3s and FTs."
"You guys won 2 games in the finals and all you are thinking about is CP3 statpadding? Man, I hope he stats pad for our team in the finals. I dont care if he literally doesnt pass to Joel Embiid if that gets us the dub."
"A guy who's played seen more prison time than court time recently, a backup PG, and some FRPs to pair with the corpse of Joel Embiid in 5 years"
You are 100% talking out of your ass. No one has ever even suggested that to be the case. Fultz/Simmons/Embiid was the big 3 and I don’t know how you can watch this team play and think that the player Fultz was supposed to be (25ppg 3 level scorer) wouldn’t fit with Joel and Ben.
Remember when hyperathletic scoring wing Andrew Wiggins was drafted before Joel Embiid? This is literally the 2014 draft all over again. Do not pass up on Mobley.
"Joel Embiid: ""First time?"""
"Not All-Star or All-NBA, but Shaq was picked to be on the NBA 50th Anniversary team in 1996. At the time he was a 24 year old 4x All-Star, 1x All-NBA Second Team, 2x All-NBA Third Team, 0x MVP, 0x Champion.   Draw whatever conclusion you'd like but that's just about where Joel Embiid is in his career now."
"His fight with the injury bug will not improve with age. Embiids lengthy history of injuries:  1.

Bone bruise in his left knee, missed 10 games, and wasn't 100% in the playoffs, 2021.   All of these problems have occurred in his 20s. I don't think your boy has what it takes to go the distance and his history would leave any rational person to agree. Are you so delusional to think this will improve as he continues to age? Even the biggest homer isn't that fucking stupid."
"1) Collangelo was gone by the time Jimmy Butler was on the team, that was Brett Brown/Elton Brand. The same duo that traded Richaun Homes for nothing. The fact that you don’t know this tells me you don’t follow the Sixers very closely, if at all   2) Holding one of Okafor and Nerlens made sense because Embiid was hurt. One of them, ideally Nerlens would have (and still is honestly) a great backup for Joel.   3) Once again, Hinkie was removed before he was even able to trade either of those guys. He also did a stellar job trading MCW and other players from the Sixers during the process, so saying he couldn’t shape a quality team is a stretch. He found great players like Covington, Grant, and Wood that wouldn’t have had a shot on any other team and now those guys, along with a few others, are still in the NBA today.   Hinkie was a great GM. He also worked with Daryl Morey on the Rockets, another great GM."
Dude we lost a game to the goddamn wizards when Embiid sat. THE WIZARDS  Obviously im not trying to imply Joel=Giannis but we are seriously down bad for years to come in the possibility that we’re ever without the man
"A few things have happened here I think.  LeBron and Steph are the most popular players in the league **and it's not even close**. Those two getting knocked out in the first round and not even making the playoffs respectively is big.  The various injuries have definitely created the perception among casual fans that these two teams don't ""deserve to be here"" and that they aren't the two best teams in the league. Say what you want about only playing who's in front of you, injuries being part of the game, some of those injuries being predictable, etc. but that's definitely the perception.  There's a lack of a villain. There are a lot of ""feel good stories"" whether it's CP3, Giannis, or even Booker/Ayton in their first playoffs, but no true polarizing player/team that people tune in to root against.  People can complain about the NBA failing to ""market the stars"" or whatever but some of it is just a style of play thing. Who's the real ""flashy"" star in these Finals? Even someone like Joel Embiid who certainly isn't the most well known by the casual fans is a fairly expressive player, compared to guys like Giannis or Ayton."

"he's shooting 13.5% from three. Whether you like him or not, you can't deny the fact that he literally cannot shoot a three to save his life. Even I, a casual basketball player, can shoot better than that shit. He had ONE ALL-NBA selection, you're acting like he's a top 10 player now because of that. He's not a superstar player, he's only made it TWICE to the playoffs leading a team (swept both times) and got carried to another, only to lose in the first round AGAIN. He's only had TWO all-star selections, and they were only in the early seasons of his NBA career.  The audacity for him to call out Joel Embiid even though he's significantly worse than him says a lot about how arrogant he is, what a fucking clown.  The fact that you're still defensive about the fact that Drummond is a negative and a fake all-star is saying a lot about the type of fan that you are. Despite all this, do you still wish to defend Drummond? I can bring up all kinds of statistics to back my own opinion up, while you stick with ""BuT hE hAd TwO aLl-StAr SeLeCtIoNs AnD aN aLl-NbA sElEcTiOn!!!!1111!1!""."
"honestly, to a point, same goes for Embiid but no one wants to mention him in the same light. he averaged almost the same FTAs in the playoffs as prime Hack a Shaq lmao I've never seen a man that big get called for such ticky tack fouls in my life. as far as I'm concerned get all of that bullshit out of the game, whether it's Harden, Joel, Trae, CP3, or whoever."
That Draymond Green is ass and that Ben Simmons is better than Joel Embiid. Really bought into the “triple single” crap and severely overvalued Ben being able to play multiple position
"There's no such thing as ""Prime Embiid Years"" if your MVP caliber big man is having severe ankle soreness. Rest the dude 2 or 3 weeks, eat some losses, let your ego take a hit. The 76ers are going to make the playoffs, have some faith that this will work for a while if Joel needs to get healthy."
 &gt;He didn't have an injury prone label at that time.  This is complete revisionist history.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2014/6/19/5824534/joel-emblid-injury-foot-nba-draft-2014-analysis  https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/tall-players-like-joel-embiid-are-more-prone-to-injury/amp/  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/joel-embiid/
"[Joel Embiid Back Injury Puts Kansas and NBA on Notice](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1988212-joel-embiid-back-injury-puts-kansas-and-nba-on-notice)  &gt;The knee injury is a mild sprain, thought to be the MCL. While this isn't serious in the long term, any knee injury for a big man is amplified. Think Greg Oden or Andrew Bynum on the bad end, but the forces due to the long levers are just tougher to deal with, especially if they start a cycle of problems.   &gt;   &gt;So far, there's no indication of that.   &gt;   &gt;However, Embiid is also dealing with a stress fracture in his lower back, according to both Yahoo! Sports' Jeff Eisenberg and medical sources, which is going to be much more concerning in both the short and long term. The injury is believed to be in the lumbar spine (the lower back)."
"For real. Since 2010, the number 3 has been:  Derrick Favors Enes Kanter Bradley Beal Otto Porter Jr Joel Embiid Jahlil Okafor Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Luka Doncic RJ Barrett LaMelo Ball Evan Mobley  And Harden went 3 in 2009.   In total, that's 5 all stars, 3 developing players, 3 good role players, and one bust. That's a great return."
Kyrie  Michael Beasley  Joel Embiid   And then let Brad Stevens try to moderate all that
Anthony Davis 3P%: .301  Joel Embiid 3P%: .330
"Joel embiid missed almost 2 years straight with a foot injury, but that hasn’t returned."
Saddiq Bey has more rebounds in 100 minutes than Joel Embiid has in 119 minutes.
"This is the worst case scenario. 6ers drag this out for far too long trying to improve their team with a distressed asset and it gets to the point where Embiid is fed up over a wasted year in his prime. I could see it happening, although it’s unlikely. Joel clearly doesn’t like what Ben is doing, so why would he do it himself?"
"&gt; Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  Rudy Gobert is top 1 lol"
"- Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  - Kyle Kyzma is top 5 in RPG (rebounds per game), higher than his former teammate Anthony Davis.   - Kevin Porter Jr. is averaging 6.3 turnovers per game to start the season, by far the league leader in this category."
"A fellow Sixers fan who isn't insulting me because I'm not on the hate Simmons train. \*handshake emoji\*  But yeah, its been ridiculous. People want Simmons to start chucking when they should really want Simmons focusing on getting to the line. If my man actually commits to more than half of the drives he takes,  he would finish better and he'd be getting to the line more often and get more reps. His usual FT is around 60% but its not usually as bad as it was in the playoffs this year. He needs to up his confidence. Simmons passing up on the open dunk was all we needed to confirm that he has legitimate confidence issues, which is weird because he CAN come across as smug if you haven't really watched him. Been watching him since his 'rookie' year, he's very sure in the things he's good at but when it comes to anything else he's so hesitant.  If Simmons becomes a legitimate offensive threat, we're looking at a potential top 15 player paired with Embiid. Fact is his passing and vision is elite. His handle is good. His man defense is elite and he has gotten better at handling the ship on that end. If he can focus on finishing at the rim and work on hitting his free throws, his ability to playmake, especially in the half court will improve. Simmons is on the cusp of reaching another level. That his floor is this high without being able to shoot or finish well in today's league is something organizations are aware of. Of course he'll have suitors who'd wanna take a chance on him. And heavens forbid this man actually learns how to shoot, we aren't looking at a top 15 player - we're looking at top 10, period. A true 2 way offensive threat with the ability to playmake. Incredibly rare player type currently.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then when Joel and Doc made their comments, even more people were saying that was wrong. Win as a team lose as a team, number one rule especially when talking to the media.  &amp;#x200B;  Yup. They said nothing wrong, technically speaking BUT they said too fucking much and this is what people don't realize. Fluff answers would have sufficed. And Embiid needs to fucking realize that if he wants to take a true leadership role. Candor has its own price to pay. Look at Dame and McCollum for example. You don't see either of them assigning responsibility to each other or anyone else on the team despite their shortcomings (to be fair, Trailblazers don't have much expectations). They just say the usual PR answers and keep it at that. If they do, its always and ONLY to themselves. All the details are left for the locker room and thats what Embiid failed to do.  Like I said, they weren't even wrong but their comments let the flood gates open wide. Its a prime example why players just say boring shit; its way too easy for the media to run away with a sound bite.  I've said too much at this point but I appreciate the compliment bro. Its nice to actually talk to someone about this topic and treat it with the nuance it deserves."
Having to watch Joel Embiid roll around every five minutes and dive into Collins’s legs has made me hate the dude. Also has the fake tough guy attitude
"&gt; Joel is a better shooter  Last year he had a random hot shooting season. He's not a good shooter historically.  &gt; better finisher  Incorrect. Embiid's %s in the paint aren't nearly as good as AD's.  &gt; better inside scorer  literally the same thing  &gt; better post scorer  marginally.  &gt; most importantly better at abusing mismatches  yeah cos his team does this magical thing called ""punishing post help with weakside action"". Not that I'd expect you to be able to tell.   &gt; better passer  Factually wrong. They're equally weak as passer but AD at least doesn't turn the ball over.  &gt; Joel never had a competent pg to run a PnR with  Bro even SIXERS fans have told me he's not good in the PnR while AD is one of the best ever. He's much more mobile, is a much much better lob threat, has better hands and is much better at finishing with momentum.  &gt; if you asked whats deadlier a Harden AD PnR or Harden Embiid PnR everyone would say theyd rather Embiid  If anyone says that they shouldn't be allowed to watch NBA games anymore. Altho I doubt they'd care because they clearly mustn't ever watch any to think that.  &gt; Joel is a significally better rim protector  Nobody is a significantly better rim protector than AD except maybe Gobert. AD's led the league in blocks 3 times, this year so far he's 1st in blocks and 151st in fouls."
"Joel is a better shooter, better finisher, better inside scorer better passer better post scorer and most importantly better at abusing mismatches instead of settling for weakass terrible jumpshot unlike AD. actually anything that involves offense Joel is better at.  except arguably PnR but even then its hard to say because Joel never had a competent pg to run a PnR with. but if you asked whats deadlier a Harden AD PnR or Harden Embiid PnR everyone would say theyd rather Embiid for a reason.   and yea AD is better at defending PnR but Joel is a significally better rim protector."
"Embiid was not better than AD the last 2 seasons. The year the lakers won the championship Ad was first team all nba, first team all defense, 2nd in DPOY and lead the playoffs in scoring. Embiid has only been better than him 1 season. And the 76ers were the #1 seed in the east so please don’t act like Joel didn’t have help. On top of all that I never said anything about all time ranking cuz AD is clearly higher. I’m talking about recently bias"
yeah AD was always viewed as being in the tier above Embiid. Joel was in the Same section but AD was argued as being between 2-6.
Joel Embiid?
"Yep, and meanwhile he's not nearly as injury prone as a bunch of other superstars are. Look at the number of missed regular season games over the last 5 seasons before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  Why is AD the one who's considered the most injury prone?"
"Legit everything humanly possible. Joel Embiid in his first year would have been better than him, I am talking about the first year he sat out because of injuries.  - Defence and Rebounding non existent, my grandma could do better and shes been dead for 5 years now.  - Couldn't catch any passes at all  - Passes he did catch he couldn't make a shot even if he was 2 ft in front of the rim. I kid you not there was a game where he missed two wide open layups.  - And anything else youd never want your centre to do he did"
"Joel Embiid has played less than 270 regular season games since 2014, guess he must be overrated too."
"Homer pick plug for Joel Embiid, I know he can come across to opposing fans as kind of annoying sometimes but it's hard to look at him and think he's not genuinely having a fuckin blast while he's playing"
"How did you forget Joel ""The Process"" Embiid"
I dunno maybe without Joel the Sixers will start moving and not wait for Embiid to do all the work.
"""Joel Embiid looks tired""    And water is wet."
Joel Embiid woke up feeling DANGEROUS🥶🥶🥶  0 Bens interacted with 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️  0-5 from the field 👋👋👋  3 TOs 😡😡😡  5 Flops 😤😤😤
"Who’s better, Khem Birch or Joel Embiid?"
"Sixers offense has been a complete disaster to begin the season. Only thing that kept them afloat was some unsustainable 3pt shooting.  Literally dead last in the NBA in pace, almost last in shots at the rim, Embiid is the only player on the team shooting FTs, just zero good passers on the team. Joel misses a month and this is a lottery team"
"Death, taxes and Joel Embiid getting the foul call"
Joel Embiid to New York LETS GOOOOOO
Joel Embiid was a bust who turns to Greg Oden by the fourth quarter.
He’s got [Embid on a poster](https://www.eurohoops.net/en/nba-news/770896/domantas-sabonis-puts-joel-embiid-on-a-poster/) before.
Joel Embiid
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
people are finally coming around to my long held belief that Ben Simmons is a MASSIVE bust.   also Joel Embiid will never win a championship as the best or second best player on his team.
"There are only 9 players in the league on supermaxes: Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, John Wall, and Rudy Gobert."
Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid will have something to say about that 😤🤫
Chris Paul and Joel Embiid
"I don't think he has had poor conditioning for quite some time. For his career he averages 30 mpg. That's where I want him to be. And tbh, he is skilled enough to be useful beyond age 33. He might still be very good and get injured *less* when he loses some of his athleticism.   Personally his athleticism gets him into trouble imo. Take Jokic for example, skilled big man that can pass at a generational level for his size while still scoring from all three levels. He isn't a good defender but he does his best to protect the rim. But the two injuries Joel had last year of any consequence were when he was making a play that Jokic can't and would never even attempt. One was a highlight reel dunk where he got very high and was moving very fast and unfortunately got bumped on the way to the rim. The second was a chasedown block that Jokic absolutely would have never even tried.   That's how Embiid gets into trouble. Most of the time it's what makes him great, but I wish he would be a bit more judicious in trying these things. And there doesn't seem to be any indication that he will slow down even with a sore knee."
no my jewish grandmother totally views adolf hitler &amp; joel embiid in the same way bro ✊
"Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid and Karl-Anthony Towns"
Until the Sixers trade Joel Embiid for Joe Ingles.

Joel do a 180 embiid
"I love Chuck, but he’s just an old head that’s mad his time in the league was 30 years too early. Basketball is like any job. You gotta take what you can get. If you can leverage a better situation for yourself because if your talent, where’s the harm in that?   I think the thing that’s bad for the league is great players being stuck in a bad situation because of things outside of their control. I don’t want to see an All Star caliber player stuck on a team where they cannot thrive. And I’m not just talking Simmons, I mean anyone.  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid were always a bad fit. Even if they got along well and enjoyed playing together, they just don’t make sense together. So for Philly to throw Simmons under the bus after watching their coach do absolutely nothing to try to make the necessary tweaks you need to make in a playoff series is absolutely absurd. Ben is not a perfect player, but nobody is. The fact that he cannot shoot should not be the issue it is when you consider that half the guys in the league can’t shoot. He more than makes up for it in other ways. Dude gives you close to 20 a game while being a great playmaker for his teammates and being one of the most versatile defenders in the league. It’s wild."
"""Look, if he died, I'd be Shaq and wouldn't give a shit. You walk onto the same court as Embiid, you're taking your life into your hands. And I swear to God, if that nobody looks at Joel again, I'm going to go down there myself."""
"Lol and by this logic, neither Joel Embiid, D'Angelo Russell, or CJ McCollum would be in the league"

"""wherever Joel plays its his house""   Embiid immediately gets balls stolen from him by Giddey.  Lmao."
Joel Embiid has an IQ around 80. I guess this announcer does too.
"And got bulldozed by a player twice his weight as well. It baffles me that Embiid went for that block, knowing he would have to practically jump into him to get it. Seems really irresponsible from Joel, he should know better. Seems like all that pent up frustration from the Ben Simmons drama is showing on him."
You sure you’ve been watching Joel Embiid?
"All he had to say was, ""Man I hope Joel didn't get hurt, a young buck like Giddey can eat a hit like that, but an old man like Embiid might need life alert"" then we would've laughed and he gets the same point across ________ But I guess that was just too easy and non-controversial"

Joel Embiid looks like he ate two Josh Giddey's. Giddey is so skinny compared to him.
Did you see Embiid patting Giddey on the head afterwards?  Would Joel do that to Bron or Steph?  Giddey gonna remember the disrespect.  Save the head pays for your fav nephew.

"Trae Young, Joel Embiid, and Jimmy Butler are almost there too"
This coming from the dude who also says Joel Embiid is overrated lol what a clown this little kid is.
"If he trades for scraps, he might waste more than a year of Embiid. Everyone wants an answer to this problem so bad they don’t care what the answer is.  If he takes scraps, it’s very unlikely he can spin that into a bigger catch. What star is acquirable with picks? The sixers have a well rounded team but they aren’t oozing role players, they kind of have to hang onto the guys they got. Grabbing picks and a few duds for Ben then requires giving up more in the second phase of trading  Why do that when you can just wait and trade Ben for a star. It’s just regular season right now, Joel and Tobias can hold down the fort until the trade deadline."
My favorite Simmons stat was that in the loss to the Raptors (Kawhi shot) a couple years ago Embiid had more 3PA (6) than Ben had FGA (5).  Joel having to shoot 3’s is ok if Ben is going 15/22 with 14 FTs because he’s getting to the rack so much.  It’s an absurd stat and I’ve been 100% out on that pairing working out ever since.
"It was a weak season for roty but it was nowhere near controversial, at least not to me.  Embiid only played 31 games out of 82. He also really wasn't a rookie, he missed not only one (Blake griffin/Ben Simmons) but two seasons because of injury and everyone else in the draft class was extremely raw at that point.  Even though Joel was the better player, Brogdon was consistent and put up solid numbers for the Bucks."
Joel Embiid for sure
"Well it helps that he's an elite shooter. For instance, very few people can guard Joel Embiid but his shot is not as reliable as KD's although he's getting there."
Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid.
"Joel is legit one of the few people that has to give 100% on defense AND offense. Even on offense he has to fight against double teams and handle the ball bc Ben can't do shit at half court.  Edit:  Embiid in G7 had 11/2/2/0/0 with 2 turnovers on 56/33/ (Had no FTs) in the fourth. He scored almost half of our 4th quarter points. FYI, he outscored anyone on the floor in the 4th. Also had the best efficiency out of everyone on the floor besides Gallinari but he only took 3 shots tbf.  Did all that on a torn meniscus, and HE could have doen more? Bro foh."
"Candace Parker was packing her bags Wednesday afternoon, prepping for an early evening flight out of Chicago to her home in Los Angeles. She was wrapping up a memorable, whirlwind few days. On Sunday Parker, who grew up in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Ill., led the Chicago Sky to the franchise’s first-ever WNBA championship; the Sky defeated the Phoenix Mercury 80-74, to win the WNBA Finals 3-1. Parker, 35, had spent her entire 13-year WNBA career with the Los Angeles Sparks before signing with her hometown team in February, with the goal of bringing a title to Chicago. She delivered—and then got to unwind a little. Parker pulled up to the drive-thru at Portillo’s, a favorite Chicago-based hot dog joint, for a jumbo chili cheese dog and fish sandwich on Sunday night. The team was feted at a championship parade and pep rally on Tuesday; Barack Obama called to congratulate Parker and her teammates afterward. Now, real-life beckoned. Following the parade, Parker dropped off her daughter Lailaa, who just started seventh grade, at the airport Tuesday. Though she signed with Chicago, Parker kept her home in Los Angeles, and Lailaa still goes to school there. “She looked at me and like, you have one day to get back,” Parker says. Thus, she was furiously packing on Wednesday, to be back in time to take Lailaa to class on Thursday morning. “So that’s the life of a mom that just won a WNBA championship,” Parker says. Parker’s used to the busy motherhood balancing act: Lailaa was born in 2009, after Parker’s rookie season in Los Angeles, when she won both the WNBA Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards, to go along with an Olympic gold medal that summer in Beijing. Parker, a two-time high school national player of the year who became the first female to win the dunk contest at the McDonald’s All-American Game, is a six-time WNBA All-Star, and two-time WNBA MVP; she clinched her second WNBA title, to go along with her two Olympic golds (not to mention the back-to-back NCAA titles she won in 2007 and 2008 at the University of Tennessee). Her full-circle, heart-warming title for the Windy City comes at an opportune time for the WNBA, which enjoyed a banner 25th season and is growing in popularity, thanks to players like Parker. As an analyst for the NBA’s widely watched programs—she’ll be back at work, fresh off the title, early next week, as the 2021-2022 NBA season tipped off on Tuesday night—Parker’s work is now familiar to a wider swath of sports fans. Due to her on-court excellence and her conversational, analytic on-air presence, Parker’s emerged as one of the most influential figures in her sport. Read more: Candace Parker on Voting Rights In an interview during a brief packing break on Wednesday, Parker put on her analyst cap to break down what this second WNBA title means for her career. “You can mess around and do stuff one time, and people can doubt it,” Parker says. “But if you do something twice, it’s not by accident. So I’ve said, from the time I was at Tennessee, in order for my name to be mentioned with the greatest players at Tennessee, I have to win twice. So I do think this was a legacy-defining moment.” One that was so much sweeter—and memorable—since she won in Chicago. “I just remember watching ‘Bron [LeBron James] when he won in Cleveland,” says Parker. James, who’s from Akron, Ohio, returned to the Cavaliers from Miami in 2014 and led his team a title two years later, ending Cleveland’s 52-year championship drought. “Just the emotion and how it hit him. And I don’t think it was until yesterday when I realized, ‘man, I went home and we won.’ I don’t know if I fully grasped what all of this means.” The Sky finished just 16-16 in the regular season and entered the playoffs as a sixth seed; Parker had injured her ankle earlier in the season and missed eight games; Chicago finished 1-7 during that stretch. “I went out to LA and really thought I got Hollywood,” Parker says. “And couldn’t, you know, be gritty and play defense and rebound and all those things we did this year. It was so hard. That’s why I love it so much.” WNBA boom Parker’s buzzy Finals win followed some key victories for the WNBA this season. Google signed on as a sponsor. The league inked a multi-year deal with Amazon Prime Video to become the first women’s pro sports league streamed on the service. On WNBAStore.com, the league’s regular-season merchandise sales jumped 50% over the prior year, a record growth. The Sky has sold more merchandise on Fanatics than any prior WNBA champion, according to the Sports Business Journal. Regular season viewership was up 51% over last year; it was the league’s most-viewed season for national TV partners in 13 years. The Finals series between the Sky and Mercury drew an average of 548,000 viewers, up 23% from a year ago; these were the most-viewed WNBA playoffs since 2014. June 2009 -10 Questions for Candace Parker 0 seconds of 4 minutes, 49 secondsVolume 0% Changing societal attitudes are driving this growth, says Parker. “We’re filled with a league that people before were scared of,” says Parker. “Like, women should be in this place. I don’t fit that. I’ve never fit that. I don’t want to fit that. I don’t want my daughter to think she has to fit that.” As people grow more attuned to the benefits of diversity, the WNBA will remain well-positioned to expand. “Companies, and actually consumers, are demanding that they are represented by women,” says Parker. “We are a league that is the majority of the minority in this world. I say that in the sense of race, sexuality, gender, all of that. So we’re what all companies want and need.” Tokyo Olympics: Sue Bird 0 seconds of 2 minutes, 56 secondsVolume 0% Back to work Parker will now turn her attention to the NBA; in March, a TNT clip of Parker explaining to Shaquille O’Neal the nuances of playing defense in the modern NBA—where nearly every player on the court, no matter his size, can make a long-range shot—went viral. “Candace Parker Schools Shaquille O’Neal” read one typical headline. Such banter with Shaq, says Parker, happens all the time. “That’s how it is back in the green room,” Parker says. “When we’re watching television, me and D-Wade [Dwyane Wade] are trying to explain to Shaq something. We’re arguing with his viewpoint. ‘Well, when I used to do this.’ Like, Shaq, you were seven feet. Literally, all you had to do was throw the ball down to you and you score. Other people aren’t like that. It’s hilarious and I love him.” She’s been tracking the two biggest storylines entering the 2021-2022 season: the refusal of Brooklyn Nets superstar Kyrie Irving to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, and Ben Simmons’ standoff with the Philadelphia 76ers. Under New York City law, Irving can’t play in Brooklyn’s home games unless he receives the vaccine: the Nets have essentially benched Irving until he complies. “I do believe we are honestly at a point now where, as Chuck [Charles Barkley] said, you do get vaccines for others,” says Parker, who is vaccinated. “I don’t fault the Brooklyn Nets at all. We want you here, but you can’t be here partially. It’s all or nothing when you’re trying to win a championship.” Read more: Nike Stays Silent On Kyrie Irving’s Anti-Vaccine Stance Parker’s more sympathetic toward Simmons. After Philadelphia lost in the playoffs to Atlanta last year, Sixers teammate Joel Embiid called Simmons out for passing up a shot in Game 7 of that second-round series; Simmons’ coach, Doc Rivers, said, “I don’t know the answer to that” when asked, after Game 7, if Simmons could be a point guard on a championship team. “I’m big on keeping internal difficulties internal,” says Parker. “So to hear your coach say that, how do you recover from that?” Simmons held out of training camp and was kicked out of practice this week for refusing to engage; the three-time All-Star was suspended for Philadelphia’s season opener on Wednesday. “I was young once, and it’s very hard to tolerate and handle an organization that doesn’t have your back,” says Parker. “There are not many people in that situation that would handle it at 20-whatever years old professionally. I just think that it’s done. It’s a divorce that needs to happen.” She’ll start opining in the NBA TV studio on Monday. But what Parker really wants to do is lounge on a Mexican beach. “I love the balancing act,” Parker says of her multiple high-profile gigs. “It does get a little bit tiring, just because there’s so much emotion and energy that goes into winning a championship. You just have that crash. But I’ll get it together.” Mexico can wait. If a basketball is bouncing these days, Candace Parker will be there."
Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid.  His prime is being wasted.
"I disagree, look at the actions of Embiid. Before Ben addressed the team, Joel was at the point of saying he doesn't want to talk about Ben and wasn't holding back his views any more.  After the chat, Joel actively starts supporting Ben again. If he didn't believe it, Joel would have said nothing. I think Ben laid bare everything and the team can see how and why he is really struggling, which is why they are actually speaking out and why Joel supposedly gave him a hug."
Not yet but I believe this is how Joel embiid will turn out
Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid 🤢
Kevin Garnett. Joel Embiid has the potential of ending up dangerously high on the list.
"She's awful a lot of times.  She's sexualizing the players in ways that would never be ok for a male. She is constantly touching players in courtside interviews, commenting on the ”big and beautiful body of Joel Embiid.” None of this shit would be acceptable for a male reporter or commenter.  I know she is there speaking and representing the female demographic, but even as such she is extremely out of date and her whole vibe tone deaf for what is happening today. Sexualizing sports is very much over and Doris should get the cold shoulder.  It's very easy to spot this too: every time Doris asks ”is it ok to say this?” the answer is clearly no. No, Doris, it's not ok."

""He does whatever he wants. That's not my job. ... I'm only focused on trying to make the team better, win some games, play hard every night, and try to lead the guys that we have here, and I'm sure they feel the same way because our chemistry has been excellent despite everything that's been happening for the last few months. So like I said, I don't really care."""
"Blake is a cheap ass who flails. He pulled Maxey's Jersey and they called the foul on the six foot guy guarding the 6'9 PF. He was acting on the Embiid elbow.   Harden and KD got calls. They even got fouls against them ignored. The push off for Harden on Maxey immediately comes to mind.  If they called Joel fairly, he'd have way more free throws. They gave KD the rip through move but won't call it for Embiid."

‪Joel Embiid is the girl thatbtrash talked her ex to all her friends and now she has to tell them all she's taking him back. ‬
"Sure, Joel Embiid didn't have a perfect series against the Hawks, but he averaged 30.4/12.7/3.9 on a torn meniscus in that series, and he works to correct the things he isn't good at. He also called himself out after that series, not just Simmons.  The frustration with Ben isn't just due to game 7 either. It was more like the cherry on top of Ben Simmons not improving his offensive game at all in 4 years, using his brother as his shooting coach, etc.  Mark Jackson/ESPN can fuck off with this everybody is equally to blame bullshit. Everyone carries some blame, but some carry a lot more than others."

"Yeah no, see Joel Embiid.   You're probably the only KP apologist on planet earth, I love seeing the ""you don't understand basketball"" line from someone who doesn't know wtf they are talking about lol."
Let me ask you this if you see a spoiled child do you blame the kid alone or do you put some of it on the parents? I think the 76ers  deserves some blame for pampering him as long as they did. I think Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid deserve some blame for their comments. I think Ben Simmons deserves blame for a complete lack of professionalism. I want to believe Ben but who knows. I just hope if it’s really mental health issues that he seeks out and gets the help he needs.
"The best lineup I can think of:   PG: **Trae Young** - lacks the size to be a SG  SG: **Bradley Beal** - too small to be a SF, can't run point  SF: **Gordon Hayward** - most SFs are pretty versatile but Hayward is one of the few who can't really slide to SG or PF, despite having a range of skills  PF: **Julius Randle** - prototypical PF; too slow to be a SF, lacks the skills or height to be a C   C: **Joel Embiid** - you pair him next to any other true center, you're going to have a bad time.   So yeah that's a damn good team that sweeps their way to a championship."
"The sixers didn’t just blame him this narrative is stupid and being repeated over and over again until it’s true. Similar to the Ben had his cellphone in his pocket during practice lie. They defended him all year and then rightfully put him in as part of the blame as to why they lost. Joel blamed himself, Ben, and even Tobias. The only ones who get a pass in that series really are Joel, Maxey, Curry. But even Embiid was bad down the stretch (primarily cause Ben and Tobias couldn’t help him after doing lots of carrying). The media has gone crazy with this narrative, even Daryl Morey has done nothing but believe in Ben Simmons and his value. The only guy he realistically tried to trade him for was James Harden who he loves like a son at this point."
"Injured guard Shake Milton yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Furkan Korkmaz gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Tyrese Maxey yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Simmons hit the locker room door, current NBA great Joel Embiid hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Well Joel Embiid said the front office picked ben over jimmy and he said it this week into a press microphone
I don’t care about this man - Joel Embiid

Since 2018 :   Giannis Antetokounmpo averaged 36.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists.   Joel Embiid averaged 25.8 points, 13.6 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Nikola Jokic averaged 24.7 points, 12.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists.   Anthony Davis averaged 24.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks.   Karl-Anthony Towns averaged 23.4 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Zion Williamson averaged 24.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists."
"I need the Pistons to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Sixers. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close. Fuck Embiid and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first. Fuck the Process. Fuck Sam Hinkie. It's not adorable to be utter shit for several years by choice. It's pathetic. Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games. Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Joel ""69% conditioning"" Embiid. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional. But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""RoCo"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Ben Simmons is LeBron 2.0 and Embiid is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot. Fuck the Sixers, Fuck Embiid, Fuck Sam Hinkie, Fuck the Process. Also FTP."
"How are you telling me it’s factually incorrect when you don’t even have access to the stats?  And win shares, BPM etc are extremely outdated  stats. Jokic apparently had a higher peak than Shaq by several standard deviations. Paul George is apparently better than Kobe. I just don’t think harden was as good as Kd in the playoffs, kds defense on tatum, scoring and efficiency were a lot better.   And here’s an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"
"Strictly speaking to skill level and productivity/efficiency on the court i believe that Luka Doncic was the best player in the league that year. The team was stopable, but luka was unstoppable. It can be argued that season that Joel embiid and nikola jokic were better. I might add there isn’t much to argue. They both played MVP caliber seasons. The numbers aren’t particularly there state wise but thats why there is a valid argument."
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."
JJ Redick    PG - Luka Doncic   SG - Vince Carter   SF -  Jimmy Butler   PF - Zion Williamson   C - Dwight Howard    BENCH   PG - Chris Paul   SG - Jrue Holiday   SF - Brandon Ingram   PF - Rashard Lewis   C - Joel Embiid
Also beat a magic team that clearly didn’t deserve to be in the playoffs and went up against a philly team in which Joel Embiid had problems with his stomach or something.  Then beat a warriors team with an injured Klay and KD.
"Joel Embiid   Also, I love Tatum, but him and Book should not be here, PG and Jimmy Butler should be here instead, due to their superior experience and IQ."
Joel embiid  Both elite rim defenders and great mid range jumpers. Also both are injury prone.

"He's (JoeL) also developed quite a nice dream shake (if you can call it that). It'll be hard for Gasol to defend against a faster, more agile Embiid going into the new season"
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
Ben Simmons vs Joel Embiid. After whenever/wherever Simmons gets traded
Its honestly crazy how good Gasol is versus Embiid considering how dominant Joel is in almost every other matchup
"I remember reading this a few years back (and if you watch older footage of Giannis, including some pre-draft footage, you’ll hear Adetokunbo more), but I also recall something about Embiid along the same lines, which is weird because he’s not Greek  Ring any bells? I think someone said his name was translated phonetically and, if they did to him what was done to Giannis, we’d be calling him Joel Embiint."
"Simmons has absolutely no reason to show up. Him holding out into the regular season until a trade gets done is best for his camp. Morey isn't going to have $30 million attached to a player who refuses to report to the team when the team needs to win now or risk pissing off Joel Embiid. If Simmons shows up, he'll never get traded because of Morey's unrealistic trade demands."
"Supposedly Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka used this to their advantage when guarding Joel Embiid during their 2019 playoff run.  &gt; Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand.  https://twitter.com/ROSGO21/status/1128011415435059200"
"Yeah, but he's on a max contract.  You can have two maxes and a supermax, plus filler.  If you're paying Ben Simmons a max, you need rim protection, half court offense and shooting out of your max and supermax.  Philly couldn't do it with Joel Embiid, the best big man in the game.  Nope, signing Ben Simmons says 'We're happy to scrape into the playoffs and get bounced in five games'."
"&gt;in which we overpaid for a player whom we will only have so many good years left of.  Did you forget you have Joel Embiid, a center with glass bones?"
Joel Embiid being an mvp candidate in the nba while also going 30-0 in fut weekend league
"please stop, Joel Embiid is not as good as Giannis as a scorer. the man he’s had 2 years even being at elite level offensively. he had like a below 55% TS in multiple playoff series as a Center."
I just want to make sure; We're talking about Joel Embiid?
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
Philly has to be in win now mode. No one knows how much longer Joel has in this league with his injury history. Philly is the favorite in the East with Lillard in my opinion because if they face Brooklyn Embiid without having to leave the post is going to score 40 a night on Brooklyn's big men.
"&gt;True but Joel was playing injured throughout the postseason as well  Did it matter though? His flaws (turnovers and lack of playmaking, as well as consistent defense when the offensive burden increases) were basically the same, and so were his strengths (he still dominated scoring wise). Props to him for playing through injury, but he was playing at a level where a ""healthy"" Embiid wouldn't be much different for Philly than ""injured"" Embiid. Sort of like if we lost to the Suns, no one would say if Giannis was healthy, we would win the Suns series because he was still dominant regardless of injury and him being healthy would not change the outcome. In fact he was better after the injury"
&gt; who gives a damn if he can’t shoot.      Joel Embiid
"I didn't say it wasn't a skill or that it's a bad thing.  It's just a different ability (and one that jokic + a good system helps with).       Looking at raw % without taking into account the type of shots is lazy and useless.  E.g."" Joel Embiid is a better shooter (37%) than Doncic (35%)"""
This is like Joel Embiid saying when healthy he’s the best player in the league
Over 50% of KATs shots come from within 10 feet of the basket   That’s more than Joel Embiid
"I mean I just call that karma for pushing then MVP front runner Joel Embiid to the ground injuring him, then walking away."
"I went to the KU-Duke game in Chicago in 2013 and all the hype was for Andrew Wiggins vs Jabari Parker. Joel Embiid came off the bench that game. But as the season went on the hype started shifting from Wiggins to Embiid. Particularly after Joel started flashing some low-post moves. I remember Fran Fraschilla being hyped after Embiid's ""Dream Shake.""   So I think Embiid always had pretty good footwork, probably from playing volleyball and soccer growing up. And that combined with being big and strong and naturally talented led to him quickly developing as a basketball player. The scary thing with Embiid is that he's still making huge strides in his improvement as a player. His mid-range improvement last season was pretty remarkable. He just needs to stay healthy."
Ain't nobody taking Kat or vooch over Embiid as a whole tho. Maybe Jokic but I'd still take the athleticism of Joel.
"What is with people and glorifying low volume three point shooters? That's a very minimal part of his game. If Joel Embiid is shooting 5 threes in a game, that's a win for the defence."

Regardless of Tommy's intent his comment was rooted in classic racism about Africa. When Joel Embiid found himself getting interviewed by people with racist/ignorant questions about Africa he lied and made up stories about fighting a lion to earn his manhood... Because only a ignorant or racist idiot would believe that about a guy who grew up in middle class and Cameroon with parents who work for the government 😂
"This was the origin of Joel ""do a 180"" Embiid."
Joel “PHILLY GOOSE” EMBIID
Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are two all nba players
"I seem to remember looking at it a year or so ago and AD and Embiid were basically the same from midrange (and close to AD’s numbers this year). Was a massive improvement from Joel this last year, idk if it’ll continue"
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn’t even close y’all got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven’t seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
Joel Embiid has led his team to the playoffs every year he has been healthy. AD only has done that twice. I’m not knocking AD for  getting beat by the Warriors I’m more or less talking about leading his team during regular success to  get into the playoffs. Obviously the playoffs is more built around the star talent that you have all I’m saying he should of had more than 2 playoff appearances while being with the Pelicans for as talented as he is
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense— some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange— I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
"No, Embiid has been on confrontation course from day 1 in the league. No surprise that besides a lot of fans you also create a lot of haters. He's calling himself Troell. Well trolls are mostly not really liked. That's why people don't like him. He made to many 'enemies' in the league. Of course people who are down with guys like Westbrook, Mitchell, Towns or Drummond (lol) won't fuck with Joel. He likes it that way, I guess."
"Thank god you've got Ben Simmons anchoring your defense with such notable liabilities as *Danny Green*, *Tobias Harris*, *Matisse Thybulle*, and horrible defensive center *Joel Embiid*. Without Simmons those guys would be lost on the defensive end."
"&gt;Think you could argue that those three guys combined would provide more value in the playoffs than Simmons.  Yeah I dont think that at all, I think that's genuinely a delusional statement.  First of all Prince is the definition of a replacement player, posting a grand total of 0.1 VORP over his 5 seasons in the NBA. I watched him for both the Hawks and Nets - genuinely one of the most frustrating players to ever watch (/u/Bigbadbuck knows.) You can get and Vanderbilt's value for 2 minimum value contract guys without having to pay $13m/yr for Taurean Prince. They are human TPEs to deliver the 3 picks.  Patrick Beverly literally does nothing better than Simmons other than spot up shoot while being way older and could decline at any point. He probably does still have value to the Sixers but in no way is what is essentially a Bev + picks for Simmons trade be fair considering picks from like 2028 (which if the Wolves are sending 3, it has to start in 2024) help Joel Embiid or is seen as a win."
Inb4 KAT slide tackled Joel Embiid in the knee
"Joel Embiid is better right now, but Sengun’s going to finish with a better legacy.  Sengun’s an apex predator. He’s dominating the competition right now and that’s with a terrible team. He looks at opposing players in the eyes and says: “This is my ball game, you’re witnessing greatness”.  He doesn’t have the jump-out-of-the-gym athleticism like LeBron or Jordan, but his fundamentals and Basketball IQ are off the charts. Very few players came into the league like this, Nikola Jokic comes to mind.  He’s going to be a problem for a long time"
Lol this is you coping.  If you keep Simmons the 2nd round is gonna be as far as Joel Embiid ever goes  The East is much better next season
"Which of those players do people like less than Joel Embiid?  Between Raptors, Celtics, Nuggets, Hawks &amp; Wolves fans Embiid gets a fair amount of hate.  Jokic is probably the most loved star on here after Doncic, and Lillard and Giannis are pretty close behind"
"&gt;2017: five-year, $148 million maximum contract  &gt;Wojnarowski reports that Philadelphia's financial protections only come in to play if Embiid misses at least 25 games or plays less 1,650 minutes in a single season due to injuries to his foot or back, parts of the body that Embiid has already struggled with. If Embiid misses time with a ""new"" injury, such as one to his knee or shoulder, the financial provisions do not apply.    &gt;If, however, Embiid does miss more than 25 games or play less than 1,650 with a recurring injury, the 76ers can cut him and save money. If they cut him after the 2018-19 season (the first year the new contract goes into affect), Embiid will earn a total of $84.2 million (all figures per Wojnarowski); if they cut him after the 2019-20 season, he'll earn $98.2 million of the original deal; if he's cut after the 2020-21 season, Embiid will earn $113.3 million; and if he's cut after the 2021-22 season, he will earn $129.4 million. The contract expires after the 2022-23 season.   https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/11/joel-embiid-max-contract-injury-provisions"
Ben and Joel can be professional but it’s still a bad team environment especially when the coach and embiid threw him under the bus. The sixers aren’t good enough to overcome less than ideal team chemistry  and win a championship.   Ben and Joel can look great in the regular season but simmons is just not a good playoff player and Philly with simmons as their number 2 are just extremely limited and that’s just another second round exit waiting to happen. If simmons sucks again in the playoffs you won’t be able to flip him for dame or Fox or even cj next year. I just don’t think it helps philly to keep Ben Simmons if they want to win a championship. Embiid doesn’t have forever so they should make a win now move   I would personally try to trade simmons and assets for Fox if the kings would do that
"Joel Embiid played a little over 26 hours of basketball this season, with that much tape on just one player in just one sport what would your suggestion be on how they should better spend their time so you can get the hot takes you agree with?"
"[Here](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/joel-embiid-supemax-contract-extension-sixers-nba-daryl-morey-sixers-front-office), he has a player option"
"Especially for Joel Embiid. I have faith that he’ll remain  mostly healthy for a few more years but the man’s career has always felt like a time bomb. If I liked where I was at and had a history of injuries, I’d sure as hell secure the bag too"
Joel Embiid is dead now

Joel Embiid.
I love Joel Embiid
"&gt;Andre Drummond  Going to have to respectfully disagree on that one, though it's a common refrain.   If anything, I always thought Andre was super fortunate to be playing in today's NBA, where the paint is emptier than it's ever been and where teams play spread small ball, allowing him some of the most unobstructed rebounding lanes in post-merger history.   Moreover, in the age of the spread pick-and-roll, that dude's been able to average over 16 points per game despite having one of the worst offensive skills sets I've ever seen out of an all-star center... ever. Guy just gets to feast one point blank alley-oops and tip-ins (often from on the aforementioned pick-and-roll).   Andre Drummond in the 1990's or prior is in trouble. Suddenly he's not just warding off Myles Turner for his rebounds, he's dealing with Antonio Davis &amp; Dale Davis, not to mention a rebound-hungry Otis Thorpe and Jerome Williams on his own side, all crammed into the paint at once, vying for that rock.   And without the prevalence of the spread pick-and-roll, I'm not really sure how that dude's scoring in the 90's or prior because no team in their right mind would give that dude more than a couple of post touches per game. And instead of running into a Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid a few times a year, it's not hard to imagine Andre getting very lost among the shuffle of Shaq, David, Hakeem, Patrick, Rik, Rony, Vlade, and Dikembe."
"Seems like you're misunderstanding me.   Philly has 27 year old Joel Embiid. It doesn't matter if Lillard is top 10 or top 30, that team is gonna be good enough to make the picks bad."
"Tobias Harris turned down 4/80 from the Clippers and basically said, ""fuck you, either pay me or trade me/let me go.""  &gt;According to David Aldridge of NBA.com, Harris turned down an $80 million contract extension from the Clippers in ""amicable discussions."" That means he will play the one remaining season on his current contract and then be eligible for a significant max deal next offseason. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787367-nba-rumors-tobias-harris-rejects-80-million-contract-extension-from-clippers  Then he gets traded to the 76ers, and they immediately re-signed him for 5/180.  LOL  &gt;The Sixers will retain free agent Tobias Harris on a five year, $180 million contract, a source confirmed to PhillyVoice on Sunday evening. It is a small discount underneath the max, but not much of one, and Harris will be paid handsomely to play alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons for years to come.  https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-free-agency-tobias-harris-sixers-philadelphia-76ers-sign-five-year-180-million-contract/"
"Tbh Brett Brown was doing a great job in this series.  He basically got the sixers the 2-1 lead after they got blown out in game 1 from his matchup and timeout pattern changes.  Game 1 Butler and Harris got fkn bbq chickened by Kawhi and Pascal all game, from then he was the first coach to implement the Center on Siakam and forward on Gasol.   His sub patterns of pulling Embiid early too caused alot of issues for the raps since Nurse was being stubborn and not handcuffing Gasol's minutes to Embiid's.  Joel feasted on ibaka all series."
"Joel Embiid.  Not in terms of skills, just in terms of career impact. He's only played like 260 regular season games, and he's never made it out of the second round in the East.  He's a great post scorer, but isn't a good facilitator from the post in the clutch and is less efficient than people think."
"What would be the best starting 5 in the NBA with all players  I know I want Steph, Giannis at the 4, Joel Embiid at the 5. But I’m not really sure where to go from there."
I'll play along because I too am bored.  Bold players are my starting 5.  **PG Stephen Curry (2009; All-Star)**  **SG James Harden (2009; All-Star)**  **SF Kawhi Leonard (2011; All-Star)**  **PF Kevin Durant (2007; All-Star)**  **C Nikola Jokic (2014; All-Star)**  PG Chris Paul (2005; All-Star)  SG Klay Thompson (2011; All-Star)  PF Anthony Davis (2012; All-Star)  C Joel Embiid (2014; All-Star)  PG/SG Jamal Murray (2016)  PG Ja Morant (2019)  SF Jeff Green (2007)  C Clint Capela (2014)  SG J.J.

Luka-Bradley Beal-Jaylen Brown-Jayson Tatum-Joel Embiid with RJ Barrett-Otto Porter- and Enes Kanter off the bench.
He is also very long. I’m convinced he has a short head. Like look at his shoulder height then look at his neck and head. His standing reach is only 1.5 inches smaller then Joel embiid and his wingspan is the same but Joel embiid is listed 3” taller.

Jumping on a Joel Embiid 3 point attempt
"Still one of the most over exaggerated plays of the season. Yes it was a flagrant type of play, but people pretend LeBron literally tried to kills Embiid lol. Joel being injury prone is the only reason people are up in arms over this play.."
Ahh my b. Idk I guess I just don’t see it if he’s the center of your offense. I think he’d be better in a slightly lesser role as like the number two to Joel Embiid where they just let him cook but if he’s off Joel takes over. I’m not sure that Cleveland wants to trade him so it’ll be interesting to see if he becomes a better facilitator.
You want to tell me that Joel Embiid couldn’t play with guys like…Darius Miles back in the early 2000s. But past prime Larry Bird would’ve no issues chasing guys like LeBron. Ok then.
Has Joel embiid ever done that ? Every team he’s been on that’s made the playoffs has been pretty good. Joel has also never been past the second round same as AD before lebron
"AD is more efficient offensively and is a better defender in the playoffs where it matters. AD is actually the best playoff defender in the league.   Joel is a bit better floor raiser now, but AD is a much better ceiling raiser. He doesn't get locked up in the playoffs half the time, shoot like shit from the field in 4th quarters (Embiid went 0-12 in Game 4) and doesn't get beat in the P&amp;R like Embiid does.   And Joel has had a better team in an easier conference than AD has had in NOLA. Joel has gone as far in the playoffs as AD has (2nd round) while facing easier competition (AD ran into the Warriors every time) while AD's teams were always hurt."

"It’s great for bench players and borderline starters, bc it puts them on equal footing to see how they stack up if they all played the same minutes. I don’t think it’s useful at all for an MVP candidate. The more time a star spends on the bench, the more time he’s relying on his teammates to get the job done for him. Any potential HoFer should be judged on per game stats, not per 36.   Except for this one of course, because I think Joel Embiid is the world’s greatest human and this fits my narrative"
"I think it's hard to make the case that injuries hold Kawhi Leonard out of the top tier (and honestly Joel Embiid as well) but keep LeBron in there. He is going to be 37 coming off an injury that 100% looked like it hampered him. And the media narrative that he was playing as well as anyone before he got hurt is BS. If his name were anything other than LeBron James he would not be in tier 1. And I hate that we have gotten to that point with him, but it is the truth."
I raise you one Joel Embiid

"That's a long-winded way of saying that his history clearly demonstrates that overreacting to that one series would be dumb.   Similarly, acting like a 25-year-old 3x All-Star, 1x All-NBA 3rd team, 2x All-Defensive 1st team, DPOY runner up, who was just the #2 on the number 1 seed in the East and who helped them maintain that despite Joel Embiid missing 21 games, is suddenly some mediocre player because of a bad playoff series is dumb."
"&gt;Lol the playmaker is Joel Embiid. The offense runs through Embiid, not Simmons.   &gt;funny how people here on this thread don’t seem to know this even though everyone literally makes fun of his offense on r/nba.   Yes it makes complete sense that your basketball knowledge is shaped by what r/NBA thinks.    &gt;The bigger loss from Simmons is on defense. His offense won’t be a loss whatsoever. &gt;  I genuinely wish I was as confident as you are."
"Lol the playmaker is Joel Embiid. The offense runs through Embiid, not Simmons. I guarantee you Thybulle plays more mins this season if Simmons is out. They need to replace Simmons defense more than his offense…funny how people here on this thread don’t seem to know this even though everyone literally makes fun of his offense on r/nba.   The bigger loss from Simmons is on defense. His offense won’t be a loss whatsoever.  Who do you think gets all of Simmons minutes? Maxey? Maxey isn’t randomly going to just go from 10 mins -&gt; 40 mins. Someone else gets some of those mins and Thybulle will be the one, along with possibly Reed even if they go big."
"&gt; Plus giving Horford that huge deal when they could have used it on a point guard  yeah, Brogdon was on the table and they chose to go with an insurance clause for Embiid's injury proneness rather than the smart option....they essentially said Horford was there because Embiid is always injured and they needed a backup plan in case Joel went down"
"&gt; Embiid was the sole reason for losing a winnable game and was atrocious in multiple 4qts but he gets a pass imo because he was injured                     Why does Joel Embiid get a pass? Because he was injured? You mean the guy that is always freakin injured gets a pass for being injured yet again? Was it heroic that he played on a torn meniscus? Yeah, absolutely. Was it amazing that he averaged 30 a game on that knee? For sure. But the underlying fact remains he was injured again. This dude just can't stay healthy and that's a huge factor in a team's quest for success....you can't win if your best player is on the bench or playing hurt. Without the injury Joel probably averages 35 a game and the series is over 4-1. Nobody gives Porzingis a pass for being injured half the time, they're just annoyed as hell that he is....Joel shouldn't get a pass either."

Joel Embiid will lead the Sixers to the NBA finals with or without Ben Simmons on the roster
Simmons the only cat that can make people question Embiid in terms of fit lmao  Y’all sow how good Jimmy Buckets and Joel were
"Lol I dont know why you people keep saying this. He wasn't thrown under the Bus. in the exact same quote that people keep using to justify this argument, Joel Embiid blames himself for his many turnovers. So if he threw Ben under the Bus then he jumped in there with him.  As for Doc, he was simply asked ""Can Ben be a PG for a Championship Team"". Doc said the most rationale answer which was ""*I dont know*"". Which is true, WE DONT KNOW. He's never Won a Championship as a PG."
"Rewatch the series, and you'll see two names show up throughout for their 4th quarter disappearing act. Joel Embiid gets a pass, and even shockingly applauded for hanging Simmons out to dry, when in fact without Ben there all eyes would be on him."
"&gt;  Ben gets the most attention because nephews watch highlights and wank off to Ben Simmons hate porn.  You're missing a big piece of the difference between Ben and Doc/Joel/Harris. Whether the latter 3 made a lot of mistakes or not, they were trying their best to win. Ben draws so much criticism because he hurt his team by refusing to shoot, something that's entirely within his control.   He had one (1!) 4th quarter FG attempt over the last 6 games of the series (plus a whopping 2 in game 1). He took 14 shots total in the last 3 games of the series (even Ben Wallace averaged 6 shots per game in his playoffs career). Simmons passed out of dunking on Trae in crunch time of game 7. All of those are completely unacceptable for your #3 scored. And when you put it all together, it's a completely different situation than Doc, Embiid, and Harris. Those guys tried and made mistakes, maybe too many. But at least they went down swinging. But Simmons was seemingly afraid to even try."
"i don't coddle Ben.  I want him gone.  I also want Doc gone.   Doc for being a shitty playoff coach.  Ben for being a shitty playoff player.   They'd be fine if we didn't also have an MVP level star in his prime, but we do so we need to do everything we can to surround him with the right guy.   And this is exactly what Doc said.   We all knew what he was saying.   &gt;MURPHY: Do you think Ben Simmons can still be a point guard for a championship team like the one you guys want to become?  &gt;RIVERS: I don't know that question or the answer to that right now. You know, so I don't know the answer to that.  https://www.phillyvoice.com/doc-rivers-ben-simmons-first-take-stephen-a-smith-interview-latest-trade-rumors-joel-embiid/#:~:text=MURPHY%3A%20Do%20you,answer%20to%20that."
Philly has nothing that would come close to Zions value not named Joel Embiid
&gt;Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  19 ppg for the series right on line with his season averages. Nobody’s saying a player can’t have a bad game.   &gt;Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Joel Embiid averaged 30 ppg over 7 games.   &gt;Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Curry - 21 ppg on **78.8 TS%**  Huerter - 13.1 ppg on 57.9 TS%  Just factually wrong. Curry’s offensive production heavily outweighed his defensive shortcomings.
"Tobias harris was like 8/24 game 7 and 2/11 in game 5 at home  Joel embiid went scoreless in a second half in game 4 at the worst time.  Seth curry was giving up every point he scored to Kevin Huerter.  Losing a series is a team effort. And yeah Ben was awful, and Embiid was a monster playing through a real injury, but Ben was crucified"
Joel Embiid.  My last inkling of hope and my entire mental well being is tied to him
"The issue is though is there never a guarantee that Ben can slow those guys down in a playoff series. People like Durant or Bron at their current ages have pretty much dominated any one on one matchups they have had.   Also as great as Ben has been on a player like Harden or Trae Young, what still gets lost is Embiids help defense. Just the fact that Ben is able to shade those player is more proof that Embiid and him still have to go hand in hand. We saw multiple times where Ben was able to funnel Trae into Embiid and force a tough floater.   No defender is consistently able to stay in front of their guy, or get around every screen. Especially not to the level of rim protectors protecting the rim. Ben would get scored on a lot more if Enes Kanter was at the rim instead of Joel."
I actually like the fit it’s like what philly was trying to do when they signed al horford but he couldn’t be on the court at the same time as embiid but dray and joel would fit better
"&gt; Your reasons for Kawhi are weak sauce. They lost to Jokic's Denver Nuggets (3-1 lead blown) 2 years ago. He won the chip 3 seasons ago now. Doesn't matter how good of a 2 way player you are if you are literally made of glass. (Also applies to Joel Embiid.)  Not really weak sauce when he was the far better player in the playoffs this year… not to mention I already said we’re assuming health which you didn’t read  &gt; Like Curry, Jokic didn't have a healthy team. The Nuggets' second best guard (Austin Rivers) was waived halfway through the season by the Knicks whose guard play was subpar in the playoffs.  Lol they lost Murray in April, his team is far superior and it’s not even a discussion   &gt; Jokic was on the court and played more games at a higher level than both Bron and AD in the last season. Jokic was better than both of them in every standard and advanced metric, including the defensive ones.  Yes and those advanced stats took a dive in the second round when they played an actual good team, once again, last time all 3 of those guys were actually healthy was in the bubble and they both outplayed Jokic   At the end of the day, there’s no chance I’m putting someone who’s never come close to winning championship over a list of 5 players who have been the best players on championship/s winning teams. And it’s not like Jokic will be coming anywhere close to a title this year either. He’ll never win a title as long as his teams defense is as abysmal as it is when he’s on the court. The Nuggets had the 2nd worst defensive rating out of every team in the playoffs when he played."
"Yeah idgaf which team you cheer for. Being a pacers fan doesn’t automatically make your opinion more valid. It is ironic though because you guys literally started two centers for the past two seasons and finished 14th and 6th in defensive rating, so it clearly isn’t a hard and fast rule like you’re acting it is. You’re acting like it’s some crazy phenomenon that an elite rim protector can make up for poor perimeter defenders when that’s literally what they’re there for. Center is considered the most important defensive position *because* they essentially “guard” the whole team from the most efficient shot in basketball. It’s why Rudy Gobert can play with shit tier defenders for 82 games and still *at least* drag them to an above average defence.   &gt;But this lineup would immediately be the worst defense in the NBA.  This is a gross exaggeration made more so because you dislike being disagreed with than it having any merit. You might as well have added “and it’s not even close” at the end. It’s impossible for a team playing Joel Embiid (assuming health, obviously) to be the worst defence in the NBA."
"&gt;Tobi would be guarding wings. He's getting absolutely cooked by everyone he'd be on.   He’s not exactly stellar at guarding forwards either. The opposing team’s best wing will primarily be guarded by either Thybulle or DG. That’s more than enough to build a functional defence.   &gt;And KP is going to guard a forward? He'll be doing circles.   Agree with that, but it’s something they can live with.  &gt;Joel is a fine defender but he can't guard his man plus two other guys that easily blew by their defender AND contribute on offense.  I disagree. I think Embiid can do those things.  &gt;This lineup is something that works in 2k but absolutely not in real life.  If you point out (and exaggerate) only the negatives while refusing to look at any positives this can be said for most hypothetical trades."
"Your reasons for Kawhi are weak sauce. They lost to Jokic's Denver Nuggets (3-1 lead blown) 2 years ago. He won the chip 3 seasons ago now. Doesn't matter how good of a 2 way player you are if you are literally made of glass. (Also applies to Joel Embiid.)  &amp;#x200B;  Like Curry, Jokic didn't have a healthy team.

Jokic was better than both of them in every standard and advanced metric, including the defensive ones.  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis and KD are the only ones who should be over Jokic. Put some respect on that man's name. He has elevated his game and his team in both the playoffs and the regular season."
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
I don't recall the Suns missing 2 of their 3 best players or the Bucks being the beneficiary of a cap spike enabling them to steal away Joel Embiid from the 76ers.
"Jokic was never that guy early on in his career, he'd have games where he took single digit shots, but the coaches and his teammates were always pushing him to be more aggressive. What confuses the matter more is that you have Joel Embiid on the team, so you're able to hide that lack of aggression even more.  Not disagreeing that it's on Ben, but in a different situation it could have turned out better. Early on I think Brett Brown just coddled his players way too much and the whole ""trust the process"" seemed like an excuse to actually hold players accountable."
"I mean in the most technical sense you guys did.  But that's only because while talented, he's such a limited player with such glaring flaws and an unwillingness to improve that building around him would have 99.9% likely mean trading Joel.  And Joel is 10x the player that Simmons is, so really it's more that Philly failed Embiid by keeping Simmons around for this long, which also didn't help Simmons much.  I think the BC era is what really fucked it since the guy clearly seemed hellbent on positioning Simmons over Embiid since Simmons was a Hinkie guy (as if BC actually did anything to get Simmons other than get hired to the team with the #1 pick lmao).  TL;DR: Fuck BC and fuck Adam Silver for forcing him on you guys."
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."

Basically to be fair.   Joel Embiid with Bill Russel.   Is a game over.   10 fingers 11 rings.   With Joel’s size and offensive weapons (and hopefully Bill’s healthier playoff runs haha)
"If Joel Embiid were to age the same way Scottie Pippen has, he'd look like Greg Oden."
im at the point now where i think there are forces holding the sixers back that go beyond personnel and management. all i'll say is this:  Ben Simmons: Nike  Markelle Fultz: Nike  Joel Embiid: UA
"Ohh ohh do Joel ""0/12"" Embiid next!"
I mean yeah because they have ducking Joel Embiid lol. The best and most unstoppable center in the league when healthy. Him and Joel would be crazy together especially considering the shooters and defense they have on that team now. It would be insane. We’re a top team in the East now but Bam has a lot of growing to do before he’s any where near Embiids level. And thats if he gets any where near there. Thank god Philly chose Simmons over him though. Know what they say about hindsight huh?
"Ben will be at his best on a non contender that isn’t on national tv. You talking about this Hawks series…  “For the third time in four years, the 76ers' season ended in the Eastern Conference semifinals. They haven’t advanced to the conference finals since 2001.   Simmons finished Game 7 with just five points. He finished the playoffs a putrid 25-for-73 from the free-throw line, the worst rate in NBA postseason history. In 56 fourth-quarter minutes across seven games against the Hawks, he took a total of three shots.”  https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid"
"Dray is more valuable than this:   “For the third time in four years, the 76ers' season ended in the Eastern Conference semifinals. They haven’t advanced to the conference finals since 2001.   Simmons finished Game 7 with just five points. He finished the playoffs a putrid 25-for-73 from the free-throw line, the worst rate in NBA postseason history. In 56 fourth-quarter minutes across seven games against the Hawks, he took a total of three shots.”  https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid"
"The problem is 100% Simmons. Embiid shot 38% from 3 this year. Idk what Center youd rather have on the court with Ben. Joel-Ben lineups have been are some of the best in the NBA every year, the defense is elite. But against good defensive teams that dont allow Ben to get out in transition and with max defensive effort in the playoffs Simmons becomes a zero on offense. And he knows it so he didnt even try to score for himself."
Pascal only shoots 30% on 5 attempts and is 28% from the corner. Joel is a better shooter but attempts less and still only shoots at 32%. Both bigs games revolves around sizing up and Siakam has a worse post game than Embiid. Add in Tobias and Thybulle not being good 3 point shooters too and the court becomes smaller than it already was.
"No it doesn't. Ben and Joel PnR can give opponents a lot of stress, it that's shooting aside, Ben is not generally aggressive enough with cuts. Siakam just shoots 30% from 3 and 28% from the corner. He's also not as quick with the step like Joel and he has very little back-to-the-basket game. It doesn't benefit the Sixers other than having insurance for when Embiid gets injured."
That Jimmy-Embiid duo would’ve been disgusting once Joel hit his mvp level potential. Unfortunate that it only lasted one year.
His team blamed him? What are you on about only joel embiid said that it was the turnin point of the game after he didnt dunk it and also held himself responsible for turning the ball over with last few minutes left. Thats not throwing a player under the bus means. That mean being responsible for your mistakes just like embiid did for himself.
"I really think Pat Bev in general is underrated, but there’s just no way he would start over Maxey.  Even if we assume they stay the same production wise, which they wont, Rese is just gonna be better this year, and age is gonna catch up to Pat Bev, their production is roughly the same, with Tyrese being a better playmaker and scorer, and Pat Bev being a significantly better defender, it just doesn’t make sense to start Pat Bev for the Sixers.  Not only is Maxey a better fit for the starters where his floor spacing and playmaking open up things for Embiid, Pat Bev is a better fit for the bench who don’t have defensive contributors like Joel and to a lesser extent Danny Green.  Like I can appreciate your sales pitch, but it’s just not true from any perspective that isn’t the Sixers should let the Wolves rob them."
i don't get it. ben simmons is in a good team (with joel embiid) and can be title contenders for years to come. why throw this all away?
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."
"Yo, you heard of that guy named Joel Embiid? He's decent at this whole rebounding thing"
"Personally, I don't see a big enough gap between the Heat/Celtics of the league and the Sixers to say one has a window and the other doesn't. We were the #1 seed last year, Joel runner up for MVP. I would bet on both those teams winning it all before the sixers, I just don't see the gap given we have a player as good as Joel.  Trying to step back and be realistic, every team that's a step below the Nets/Bucks/Lakers have a slim to none shot anyway and need a ton of stuff to break their way. Nuggest have no Murray and need MPJ to be an absolute star to get to the finals. Jimmy and Lowry need to stay healthy, Celtics need to settle into their new era and have Tatum/Brown step up as superstar players, Jazz need to figure out how to beat the best teams in the west and maximize Gobert. To me, even the Mavs/Jazz have a shot at it, and if they do the sixers do as well. If you can walk into the playoffs with the best player in most series, you should invest in that.  Beyond all that, you have to realize you're suggesting we should trade Embiid and go rebuild if we truly had our window closed when Jimmy left. Otherwise we're just wasting time."
&gt;Warriors owner Joe Lacob said in reference to a “Defensive Player of the Year candidate in Philadelphia”   Maybe he was talking about 3x All-Defense team member Joel Embiid /s
"The problem with thinking like that is teams can get better faster than you think.  For example, the *first* player shopped in The Process was the final piece in the Bucks' championship winning team, who is also the player who would best compliment Joel Embiid right now - Jrue Holiday.  The future comes at you faster than you think, and crippling your team by paying a max to a non-shooting player who may not be able to finish a game is a mistake."
"What kinda squad do you think it would take to beat this team? This is what I’d choose.       PG Kobe Bryant     SG Michael Jordan     SF Kawhi Leonard     PF Lebron James     C Joel Embiid      Allow me to explain. I think that Kobe and Jordan would be a defensive terror in their primes. Kobe was picking up guards full court when he played with Shaq and he was also given point guard duties and did a good job. Having Kobe committed to running the point while also being able to chase Steph would be fun. And Steph wouldn’t be able to guard Kobe. Jordan and Kawhi could probably both switch back and forth from Klay and KD. Lebron can hang with Giannis. And though I understand Embiid is no Shaq, he’s still really skilled, has size, and also the right type of attitude to go against Shaq. He won’t wanna get punked."
"49-23 isn't that great, the Warriors missed the playoffs with 48 wins once.  Neither point is relevant to whether or not Joel Embiid playing like an MVP (for 51/82 games) makes them a championship contender."
"Heck no. Joel Embiid still exists on that team, and he alone can carry a team, assuming no injuries."
Embiid understands that Morey is waiting to get the best deal.  Joel wants the best deal too so he has more around him.
I'd immediately dump the Sixers after well over 30 years of active fandom to follow Embiid at this point. Cheer for the Process 2.0 (Copying the Thunder and dare them to Colangelo us again) and hope for a future while enjoying Joel dominating fools.
"Get very Lucky. Let's face it they arent winning the chip with joel embid unless one of the two things happen:  1. Great FA signing (they cant sign a max player)+their other players (like Matisse or Shake) develop well 2. Ben Simmons gets traded for an all star.   And the most important thing that is a must:  Star Players get injured or fall off. I dont think a core of Dame/Beal and Embiid can win the title without injuries like last year.    Eitherway I dont see beal/dame being traded for simmons when Beal can just join the celtics and I dont think Portland wants Simmons unless you add a shit ton of picks plus Matisse.  Since I cant see these things happening, all I can say (to the 76ers) is have fun with doing The Process again."
because the Sixers have a prime Joel Embiid who they need to build around and they can't waste any seasons especially with his injury history. if Embiid was younger or had a cleaner injury history this wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue imo
"They're not hypothetical trades, with Dary Morey as our GM trades will happen. The team dynamic will change, including a possible coaching change if Doc Rivers disappoints next season. My main point is that you're evaluating the next few years as if our team cannot change, and in the NBA now that's a miscalculation.  I get the general point that we may not be able to build a better team with how our cap sheet looks, but you're talking about a team who has a literal top 5 player at age 27, locked into the best years of his career. That is a window, no matter how you slice it. Suns went from fighting for the 8th seed to making the finals in a single season. People called the Bucks done after losing to Miami. Stars are what win you titles or keep those hopes alive, and as long as we have a decent team and Joel Embiid I think our window will be open. I just didn't understand the certainty of the OP"
&gt;This has Joel Embiid written all over it.  Why? 6ers are the team currently REFUSING to trade its star.  OKC has a track record of helping trade away stars. Could also be someplace like CHO or ORL.
Ben Simmons sucks and I hope he sits for the remainder of his contract and ends his career.   Fuck him and his entitlement. Joel Embiid didnt even know how to play basketball until recently but worked his ass off through multiple injuries to become the best big man in the league.   Ben Simmons is a spoiled little bitch who thinks he’s better than he actually is. Blows my mind that someone who still literally doesn’t EVER shoot would have the audacity to do this.
"Carmelo ruined Linsanity because he would not adjust to the playstyle that worked way better.   Simmons is the best defender in the world I'd take him if I was a contending team.  Charles Barkley was way better than Malone Barkley just didn't have the same luck.  Lakers will at best reach the 2nd round this year, I thi k LeBron is past his best (Wouldn't suprise me if he's great it's just a feeling), the vets are not a good fit, melo and russ will irritate the fuck out of lebron and ad.  Joel Embiid will win mvp this year.  Max Kellerman has made us under rate iggy, he was great, all time clutch and is now seen as a meme"
"Lets not forget that Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid ALSO make 30 mil + a year on that team. I really like Ben Simmons and fuck all the hate. Where were they?"
"These people are all fucking idiots.  Ben Simmons didn't cause Joel Embiid to play like shit in multiple second halfs in that series. Ben Simmons didn't cause Doc Rivers to become the shittiest coach in the league. Ben Simmons didn't set fire to Trae Young.  It's become a meme at this point. Philly fans are happy to play along, because it lets them absolve their savior Joel of any blame, and the organization is happy to play along because then none of them have any consequences.  It's such a joke, and Philly is such a toxic team."
"He's not on Draymond's level as far as decision making goes. He doesn't have the ""chemistry"" Draymond brings to a team. He doesn't have the experience Draymond brings. He's just not on that level, especially as far as the ""hard to quantify and/or explain"" (often called ""intangibles"") Draymond brings.  One of those ""hard to explain / quantify"" things is the difference in ""threat to shoot"" or ""threat to beat us"" between Ben and Draymond. Ben is zero threat to even shoot and if he throws one up once from outside once in a while he's been so bad for so long you make him ""prove it"", because the chances of him ""beating you"" just aren't very good.  I mean you can seriously say ""let's key on everyone else, collapse hard on Embiid and make him work for everything all game long and if Ben can beat us, good for Ben"". You drop off him. You can ""hide"" a weak(er) defender on him. You can dare him to beat you ... If you try that shit on Draymond you'll get wrecked, because he will find a way to exploit you even if that requires him to shoot the f'ing ball.  Reality is Ben was given home court advantage with Joel Embiid (nigh unstoppable on the block) and Seth Curry (always in the race for highest 3 percentage in the league) and couldn't figure out how to beat the ""We're basically all 3 or 4 years out of college"" Atlanta Hawks in a 7 game series 🤷🏻‍♂️ ... That's not an ""omfg we need him on our team"" resume piece."
"""The Process"" is just Joel Embiid at this point.  No one can say the original ""process"" had any chance to play out after Hinke was forced out and Jerry Colangelo's failson was installed by the NBA. Then Elton Brand had his chance. Now it's Morey. There hasn't been an opportunity for any GM's vision to be realized because no GM has stayed for more than 3 years."
Yeah Joel Embiid definitely strikes me as the type of guy who would want to sit out after [this kind of post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSrkyrJAXTn/?utm_medium=copy_link). Joel has said he wants to retire in Philly multiple times.
Your superstar is Joel Embiid lol  Simmons is still a star. You can hate him all you want but the guy is still an allstar caliber player.
"It’s taking two 10 second, out of context sound bites from two separate post game interviews and protrays those clips as the only negative thing either Doc or Joel said. Honestly, Joel was much harsher on their effort and game plan than he was of Simmons and Doc’s presser was just flat out bad but acting like what he said about Ben was the most inflammatory statement is a mischaracterization, imo.   Plus, as someone who has said Simmons needs another ball handler alongside him like a Patty Mills type player if you truly want him as a primary ball handler on your team, saying “I don’t know if Simmons can be a PG on a championship team” is just expressing a view that most Sixers fans already believe. Even pairing Simmons and McCollum or Brogdon would work, but having him share the court with Embiid and Harris just exposes his weakness in the half court even more so than if there was another capable PG on the roster."
"You may see it that way, but do you think Embiid would be ok with that?  ""Hey Joel, you're getting older and getting a longer and longer injury history as the years go by, but sit tight for 4 years while we wait out this Ben situation."""
Our star is Joel Embiid lol
"If I was Embiid I would be done with the franchise too, all Morey has done this offseason is squander the value of the 2nd best player on the team and signed Andre Drummond as a backup center. Plus Doc Rivers is still the head coach despite another incredible playoff collapse. Honestly Joel should just be done with the floundering franchise and demand a trade to south beach."
Joel Embiid once scored 0 points
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"It’s not the same as match fixing, because the players and the coaches(managers in football) are trying their hardest to win.  It’s the team ownership/front office etc that’s trying to lose by trading their good players for not so good ones. Because in the nba where a losing team gets a higher chance to pick players earlier in the upcoming crop of players who want to enter the league, there’s an incentive to lose for teams aren’t very good in the first place because one or two great players can make a team great for at least 4-5 years which is the automatic length of a rookie contract that’s picked earlier, not even mentioning that after said rookie contract a player is what’s called a restricted free agent, which means the team has the right of first refusal and has the option to match whatever offer a great player receives on the open market and retain said player.  So you see teams that aren’t realistically vying for a playoff spot or a championship has better incentive to lose than to win. What’s 2-3 years of sucking to the potential 10 years of having one or two great players on your team from the draft, who can then attract more good players to players and then contend for a championship  The NBA front office does not want to acknowledge this really. This is called tanking and the nba commissioner for example when he hears the word he corrects the report by saying “actually it’s retooling while staying competitive” which everyone knows is BS. And for the case of the 76ers the General Manager who was overseeing what was eventually dubbed “The Process” which is just tanking, got fired because pressure from the league front office and other teams. You see Philadelphia is a big market but not a lot of people were watching them when they were being terrible on purpose and the other teams were sick of losing revenue/ draft picks to a team that was blatantly trying to be bad even more openly and worse than other teams have done before. Although in the end I’m kind of worked out in that the 76ers eventually got a Great player in Joel Embiid and a really good player in Ben Simmons because they were tanking. Because of that eventually the guy who engineered it but then got fired sort of became a folk hero in Philadelphia. His name was Sam Hinkie and he died for our sins"

"I don’t really see how Giannis is up there. He’s great in his role but he mainly just sits on the corner man and gets defensive rebound and provides occasional secondary rim protection if Brook can’t just sit at the rim  I would take Bam, Joel Embiid and maybe Simmons over Giannis"
Joel Embiid
"Babyface will be Curry, or an outside chance it's Jalen Green.  Heel in the actual sense will be the Nets as a team, but the fun-to-hate, goofy, wrestling-style, ""I will most definitely be smiling if I get to take a picture with them after the game"" heel role firmly belongs to Trae Young and Joel Embiid. Last year people realized that those two guys are too good to disrespect and incredibly fun to root against."
Which PG would be worse in their current team situation with Joel Embiid? Probably just Steph?
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
"I do hope we get to see Giannis Vs Embiid in a 7 game series at some point, their match-ups are spectacular to watch. I remember to Philly Fans on Twitter saying that Joel will remember this and will get his revenge in the play-offs and we were 1 game away from seeing it in the Conference Finals, would have been great."

Don’t forget the Celtics have probably the only player capable of guarding Joel embiid. Hopefully he’s not to old now
The Celtics are going to be top 3 this season if they stay healthy. They also have the only person in the league that can guard Joel embiid. But he might be too old now
"i.e.; the Sixers would be better trading Simmons for picks or solid role players around Joel and try to sign someone in FA or make a trade at the deadline, Wall and Simmons are both not worth what their contracts eat up when you have a first option as good as Embiid and youre trying to buikd a championship roster around him."
"Probably not but it's not crazy. The issue is his timeline vs Embiid. He's not really a winning player yet (Ben is in the reg season at least, despite his faults). It's a bit like the proposed Fox or a Halliburton trades. They are good young players but aren't going to be good enough quick enough for Joel."

"I have to believe Embiid is not under 3 bills. As someone who is from a family of large men with similar body types, I can say with confidence there’s no way he’s not 300 atleast. If I had to guess I’m saying 315. It’d be different if Joel was one of those chicken legged 7 footers, but he’s put together well. And a legit 7 ft too, not all these guys are as big as they say they are, but that’s well documented on this sub so I don’t mean to beat a dead horse there."

"If we're working brain breaking mathematical conditional statements, Kendrick Perkins in Philly with Joel Embiid would be better than Ben Simmons in Philly with Joel Embiid.  A chilli dog in Philly with Joel Embiid would be better than Ben Simmons in Philly with Joel Embiid."
"This is why it's so damn funny when people talk like Embiid would have a chance against Shaq in his prime. Not only was Shaq a whole Hoops heavier than Joel, but Shaq was just as agile. Embiid would have had problems with David Robinson. Shaq is a whole other monster to fcuk wit."
"PG: Shai Gilgeous Alexander  SG: Paul George (allstar)  SF:  Kevin Durant (superstar)  PF: Jayson Tatum (allstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  \---  Bench PG: Fred Vanvleet  Bench SG: Mikal Bridges  Bench SF: OG Anunoby  Bench PF: Robert Covington  Bench C: Myles Turner  \---  Third string: Marcus Smart  Third string: Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;  I think starting lineup is basically impossible to guard. Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
Joel Embiid
"Clone Joel Embiid. God, why didn't we think of that!"
Joel Embiid is better by himself then with any of those 2
"lol Wall is not a capable defender anymore if he ever was one. And if you want Matisse to start the offense with Wall will be terrible. Wall is completely washed at this point. He came off like two years of not playing NBA basketball, he has had more and worse injuries than Embiid, he's a terrible shooter, he's old and his contract is one of the worst in the league.   And Joel can definitely handle anchoring the defense and being the number one option but only in the playoffs. None of the moves the Sixers make for better players matters if he gets a significant injury"
Personally I think Joel Embiid is better in Philly with Joel Embiid than John Wall in Philly with Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons in Philly with Joel Embiid
"Bron is an all time flopper, just like Manu. Also ask Joel Embiid about how dirty he is."
"I'd put him a hair above Steph right now, but behind Jokic. He's just on another freakin' level. I wouldn't pick Embiid because his team is fucking stacked and is still not THAT much better than Portland or Denver.   Shit, we beat Philly twice without CJ or Nurk. One of those games we didn't even fucking have Dame OR RoCo either. Denver just beat Philly in January as well.   I think Simmons is just as vital to that team as Joel. Without one or the other, they are probably middle of the pack or worse. Definitely gotta take into consideration how much more forgiving the east is. I think the Sixers will actually end up third or fourth the way Brooklyn, Miami, and Milwaukee are playing. It's only a matter of time."
"I'm a big fan of defense (you can check my posting history) so if anyone's gonna win MVP not named Joel Embiid, I rather give it to LeBron with the way he has been commanding the Lakers defense even without their most valuable defensive player."
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
"If embiid didn’t get hurt: Jokic embiid giannis in that order, only real considerations imo. Since embiid went down giannis is going to pass him on my list. It’s still anybody’s award between the top 3, Joel had huge narrative before his injury so maybe the voters will show mercy if he comes back just as strong who knows."
"It sort of is. His hook-shot is one of the 20 best in the league or so. He doesn’t get a lot of chances to use it since, you know, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris."
"“There is no point in...”  Lol yeah there is. I just gave you my point. You paying attention?  I said the dude that dominated in the playoffs last year is better IN MY OPINION. You don’t have to cape up for Embiid I’m not about to get into a debate w you. You can think Joel is better I won’t stop you, bud."
"Some famously injury prone players would be Blake, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, AD, Cousins and Kristaps. Some others would be Bagley, Kevin Love, Marcus Smart, Gallinari, and Aaron Gordon."
Brown thought he was Joel Embiid on that play and try to take it to Rudy... bad idea.
Joel Embiid has already laid claim to tall harden
"If we all played Joel Embiid to save our lives,  do you think his bone would hold him back?"
Wait until I tell you about Joel Embiid.
Team has DPOY and Joel Embiid but somehow aren't the best defense in the NBA. Something isn't adding up.
First off Embiid and Kawhi aren’t even comparable. Kawhi has shown he can play 70+ games in a season on multiple occasions. Joel embiid has NEVER done this. Second if jokic is so bad defensively how come he’s made it farther in the postseason than embiid in the TOUGER conference with LESS surrounding help?
"Someone that has the athleticism and verticality to be able to catch lobs and finish dunks, at the 5 meaning as a Center (positions are numbered 1 through 5). A good example is if you look at the sixers, our main 5s/centers are Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard. Embiid’s obviously amazing, but he’s not much of a lob threat. He doesn’t get up in the air super quickly, he’s quick on his feet moving around but he’s not jumping out of the gym on a consistent basis. Dwight has a far more limited skillset, but he’s a terrific lob threat. He has a huge “catch radius” meaning he has a lot of range for where passers can put the ball on an alley oop, it doesn’t need to be perfectly placed.   LaMelo is an incredible passer, and plays extremely well at a fast pace and in transition, and having a center who is a true lob threat (compared to Cody Zeller and Bismarck Biyombo who are not), would benefit both players a lot."
"76ers had: Ben Simmoms (6'10), Jimmy Butler (6'7), Tobias Harris (6'8), Al Hordford (6'9), Joel Embiid (7'1)"
"I’d argue its even more valuable given the fact that the worst defense to win this century was like 11th in drating. Just having Embiid guarantees you a defense in the upper half of the league. However, the most valuable difference between the two is durability.  If I get Embiid 70 or more games a year then give me him if not then give me Jokic because hes a fucking bear and doesnt miss nearly as many games a season as Joel does."
"Plenty of us like Embiid a lot (I like Ben a tiny bit more but Embiid is a workhorse). Bringing up a known Embiid-hater's past comments about Joel in a thread which has nothing to do with him will obviously accomplish nothing but inciting conflict. Sorry that this guy gives Jokic fans a bad look, but you did nothing but fan the flames commenting like you did :/"
Joel Embiid is actually 27 years old. Today is his birthday. Jokic is also 26 years old as well.

Joel “the conclusion” Embiid?  Joel “endgame” Embiid?
Yeah a trip is an automatic foul in the NBA and the players know it. It’s why Joel Embiid spends more time each game laying down than standing up.
ahh yes.. that was the reason we lost. Joel Embiid and not the minutes he was off the court https://i.gyazo.com/9d02a20ee25c38050a901f2671e57644.png
"The Celtics 2 best players are top 3 picks, the Pelicans have 2 all-star caliber players who were both top 3 picks, 1 on their own accord and 1 through trading AD (yeah it’s called rebuilding, do your Googles), Donovan Mitchell was a lottery pick, Devin Booker was a lottery pick, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were lottery picks, Bam Adebayo was a lottery pick."
"I mean the team had an ORTG of 96 when Embiid was on the court: https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-76ers-vs-raptors.html  That’s really bad. The point is that Joel has a track record for poor shooting in the playoffs, in all three trips he has been pretty atrocious the field. He’s got career shooting splits of 43.7/28.6/78.6 in the playoffs, that is legit awful for a star. Bottom line is Joel just isn’t a top 10 player until he can play more than 80% of a season and avoid a major dropoff in the playoffs as he’s had every time he’s reached them. That 2019 team was stacked and led by a player who carried another team to the finals the next year, he wasn’t even the best player on that team in the playoffs and they still lost the series."
I dont understand your point. You excuse Joel Embiid averaging 18/9 on 53 TS% because he got outplayed by Kawhi?
"Joel embiid exists, so does jokic, so does fucking giannis whos averaged 29 14 n 6 on 56% lol. God damn that dude is nuts"
Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid
"I still don’t get why they drafted Fultz after he missed every shot during his workout. Should have swerved hard and taken Tatum.  Booker is less realistic of a timeline change.   Even if you don’t change any draft picks, if you just prevent them from their stupid trades, they could probably have a Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Mikal Bridges, and Joel Embiid starting lineup."
"&gt; MVP is based for just the regular season so we shouldn’t take the playoffs into consideration.  While I agree, that's just not how it typically works.  &gt; It feels like Giannis is having the best season of his career and especially with Joel Embiid getting injured, Giannis has to start bumping up on the list.  Team record weighs heavily in the discussion.  Third in the east won't do it."
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"Yes, I would hope Joel Embiid is a mix of Embiid."
"No. Joel is a mix between Embiid, Shaq, and Olajuwon."
Joel embiid plays closer to Joel embiid
Yes. His name is Joel Embiid.
"The US is so segregated and the Americans who are on Reddit are so heavily skewed to white middle class or professional class that I knew I would get downvoted because I doubt most Americans on the NBA subreddit have any real context for just how difficult it is to live in high poverty communities in the US, and that it comes with many unique struggles due to its ties to a very particular system of racism that is relatively unique in its continuing impact to the present day (something as simple as redlining in the past continuing to ensure Black homeowners do not get to grow wealth today compared to their white counterparts, for instance) and they also lack the context of the true scale of violence in high poverty communities in the US due to the lack of resources.  I work and live in high poverty communities in the US and have family from high poverty communities in another country. I see the comparison everyday and it's not pretty for the US, but American middle class people are so bought into this colonialist view of the world - most Americans aren't as bad as Trump, but there are reasons why he called a bunch of countries shitholes and people think Joel Embiid rode lions to school. We are a dumb AF country in recognizing what the rest of the world looks like and we have an overinflated sense of our own country."
Oh naw embiid real life just became Unguardable this hence why he’s in mvp convos which he’s never been in before and without Ben in the playoffs Joel got swept in the playoffs.
"Joel embiid should also be a DPOY candidate, next year thybulle once he gets more minutes."
"So by your logic, are we ready to crown Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid the #1 and #2 spot in the league just because they’ve had statistically better seasons? You know better than this"
I think he would've had a similar impact to someone like Joel Embiid.
Paul pierce is a shill for big joel embiid!
"Joel embiid is currently +5000 odds to win DPOY.  If anyone from the sixers gets it, it will be simmons.  Embiid is gonna end up missing 15+ games, he’s not gonna win any awards."
"Because they are. If you think Joel Embiid suddenly became better than Michael Jordan from mid-range, you're an idiot."
Soon... Joel Embiid are inevitable...
okay I agree with your comment but saying he's insanely good at almost every offensive aspect doesn't sound right when he literally cannot shoot and shooting has become the largest focal point of offense in the modern nba.    you have Joel embiid mvp big man taking and making a lot more 3s than Simmons does.
Definitely Joel Embiid. Though he would be a highly injury prone Center that couldn’t stay on the court and would be out of the league soon.  Was only somewhat wrong.
Yes. Joel Embiid is not a good shooter
"1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry   5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetounkounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Damian Lillard   9. Luka Doncic   10. Joel Embiid   11.

His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
"ESPN:  Sixers win once again proves that Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons can't play together, is it time Joel Embiid demands a trade and forces his way to the juggernaut Knicks to join with Devin Booker for the playoff push?"
"how many of these guys would you start Deandre Jordan over?  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Clint Capela  Nikola Vucevic  Christian Wood  Jarrett Allen  Karl-Anthony Towns  Montrezl Harrell  Rudy Gobert  Enes Kanter  Kristaps Porzingis  Bam Adebayo  Jonas Valanciunas  Richaun Holmes  Deandre Ayton  Steven Adams  Jakob Poeltl  Daniel Theis  Al Horford  Brook Lopez  Serge Ibaka  Mason Plumlee  Myles Turner  Wendell Carter Jr.  Moritz Wagner  James Wiseman  Cody Zeller  Nerlens Noel  Aron Baynes  I count 6 ***at most***.  That's if your low on Wiseman, and I would probably take Wendell Carter Jr. over him."
"Joel Embiid.   Makes basketball fun to watch, plays for the Sixers and is built for Philly"
Just this year. (Not counting tonight yet)  Both Ben and Joel: DefRtg: 106.30  Neither: 107.51  Just Embiid: 112.33  Just Simmons: 117.06
"ESPN headline tomorrow:  ""Should the Sixers trade Joel Embiid?"""
ESPN: Is Joel Embiid holding the Sixers back?
Embiid is a mix of Joel and Jokic.
no embiid no problem? would be wild if sixers maintain 1 seed while Joel is out
"my unfortunately the injury basically ends the first team C race for Embiid, but my (obv biased) take is that it opens the door for Simmons to play his way into 3rd team G if he keeps us afloat while Joel is out, similar to how he closed out the year a few seasons ago leading the 15 game win streak heading into the playoffs while Embiid was out.    obv he hasn't got the case right now, but an aggressive offensive stretch combined with a DPOY caliber year he's already having, and I think his case would be as good as kyrie/Paul/beal"
Lmao team sport dude. They had Greg Monroe backing up embiid and he still took the raptors to 7 games. He had the highest plus minus in the series and was +10 in game 7 with 45/48 minutes played. They were +90 with Joel on the court
"the only reason people would pick Jokic is that Joel has injury problems every single season. Just and only because of this.  An healthy Joel would be impossible to trade.   Even during draft time, Wiggins went #1 only because Joel was injured and everybody said that an healthy Embiid would've been the easiest #1 pick decision ever."
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."
"I don;t think the issue is with his opinion being incorrect  It's more like -- joel just sustained a gruesome injury in front of you, why are you now immediately shitting on another player in a pretty provocative tone  Like it's one thing to be like ""I wonder if the Sixers will be able to step up in Embiid's absence, praise embiid, than honestly say you think they won't be able to despite having ben""  it's another to be like ""mans is overrated"""
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.

"I think we could get into an extended playoff series with Boston, but Milwaukee and Joel Embiid sort of have our number. Also, the top teams in the east all have playoff hardened vets while we are pretty inexperienced.  I'm not expecting this particular Hawks team to win a playoff series, but I do expect them to go out there and not rollover. The playoff experience will be invaluable."
"And you are arguing he has “never” been snubbed. Yet you make the case it can be argued in that year. It’s an individual reward not a team reward, people are saying this year harden could be mvp and he’s playing with possibly better players than dwade and bosh in kyrie and kevin DOOOOOOOORANT. He might win this year but Joel embiid was def favorites until unfortunate injury . 🧐"

Philadelphia Clippers:   PG: Ben Simmons SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard PF:Tobias Harris C: Joel Embiid
"Lmao, it’s absolutely based in reality because Embiid already missed 7 games. Missing 9/72 games is a ton in a shortened season when Jokic has played every night AND has better impact numbers than Joel."
“Joel Embiid has been diagnosed with a left shoulder bruise and a fear of failure.”
PG: Ben Simmons SG: Mattese Thybold SF: Tobias Harris PF: Al Horford C: Joel Embiid  Nah that’s fine /s
"&gt;  Ayton is that he really can't create offense for himself so he is limited to those rim-runner, cleanup guy looks.  Which is crazy because in college he was a 20/11 guy on 65% TS which compares favorably to any 1 and done center ever including Joel Embiid and Greg Oden."
Absolutely they can. It's the reason why Gobert (who played 20 more games and 800 more minutes) made the All-NBA 3rd team in place of Joel Embiid.
joel. but if embiid is out for a while and the 76ers fall to like the 4 seed then someone else might be the favourite

Joel Embiid is the one man that can save us. Maybe Giannis too.
"The biggest part of it is that Embiid gets fouled more than the other guys, hence less FGs. That's why Joel gets more ppp from the post than Jokic, while Jokic has a better FG% there.  Shot equivalents would be much better to look at with pretty much every kind of shot.  As for doubles, my feeling from watching them is that Jokic gets doubled more often than Joel, but I don't think these numbers are available to the public."
Just going to point out that Dwight won most of these accolades including the 3 straight DPOY’s and 5 straight All-NBA 1st teams with the Orlando Magic. Dwight left the Magic when he was 26 years old.  Joel Embiid turns 27 in a few days. AD just turned 28 and Jokic just turned 26.  I don’t think any of these guys are likely passing peak Dwight and with longevity they’ve all got a ways to go.
"The East has no shot man, Kyrie and Harden are already farming those fools without quite literally the 2nd best player in the league. You could argue that it would shift the way the team play when such a big player cameback, but KD is the player that can fit seamlessly in any situation.  I like Philadelphia and Embiid, but Joel ain't KD and pairing him up with Harden and Kyrie is just 120 points waiting to happen every night. I'm honestly praying that Giannis can figure it out in the postseason and that whomever comes out of the West can compete."

Also, it’s not like embiid doesn’t play with guys like korkmaz, curry, Milton, Scott and Maxey. Just like embiid plays with a couple a really good defenders, so does bam with butler and iggy.    &gt;Miami has a better fg% against and a better 3pt% against than Philly. And gives up less free throws. So the defense that gives up less % of makes, less % of 3s made, and puts their opponent on the line less is somehow worse according to you?   How dumb are you? It’s because Miami gives up way more 3s than the sixers. The sixers don’t give up many threes with embiid because they don’t have to help off of shooters because he can command the paint on his own. You do understand that 3 is worth more than 2 right? You genuinely seemed to have a hard time figuring out something that’s stupidly simple. Let me really dumb it down to your level. If team A gives up 100 2 point shots and the opponent makes 50% they allow 100 points over those 100 shots. If team B gives up 100 3 point shots and the opponent makes 40% they allow 120 points over the same amount of shots. Even though they have a whopping 10% better dfg%, they gave up a staggering 20 more points over the 100 possessions.   &gt;And I wanna reiterate that all of this is happening while Joel Embiid is an A+ defender and Ben Simmons is arguably the runner up for DPOY right now?  Yep, and if you go by clutch time, last 5 minutes in the a 5 point game, they have the best defensive rating in the league.   &gt;Get real, bro. Even using your preferred method looks excellent for Bam.   And another hilariously ignorant statement by your dumbass. Miami literally has a better defensive rating without bam on the court vs on the court. [(source)](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612748/onoffcourt-advanced/). The same is obviously not true for embiid. Like every year, the sixers are better defensively with him on the court vs off it."
"Miami is 8th. Philly is 4th. They're separated by .010, which is nothing -- yet Philly has not one, but TWO supposed DPOY candidates on it? And doesn't employ 7 of the bottom 25 defenders in the NBA?  Miami has a better fg% against and a better 3pt% against than Philly. And gives up less free throws. So the defense that gives up less % of makes, less % of 3s made, and puts their opponent on the line less is somehow worse according to you? And I wanna reiterate that all of this is happening while Joel Embiid is an A+ defender and Ben Simmons is arguably the runner up for DPOY right now?  Get real, bro. Even using your preferred method looks excellent for Bam."
"A healthy Sixers team seem to be the most fit to eliminate the Nets.  A lot of their inside scoring would be limited by having Joel hold the fort and Ben and Thybulle causing mayhem on the perimeter.   Joel can also hang with smaller players even if he gets dragged out away from the paint. Danny and Dwight are also solid defenders. Tobias is above average.   Nets also don't have any guy to even bother Embiid.   With that said, Nets have a 70% chance to win it all. Only ways Nets might lose are injuries to core players, they choke or suffer some 0-27 typa shit. Or a combination of any"
Embiid...Shocked no-one is saying this.     Not only does Joel do it..alot. But if he gets the other teams only good big in foul trouble he will feast for the rest of the gae.
First Tom Brady and now Joel Embiid huh  I must admit my first instinct is to defend the Sixers here
"Pompey hunt-and-pecking the ""Why does Joel Embiid hide behind Tony Bradley?"" article as we speak."
- Joel “Do a 180” Embiid
"Counterpoints: Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Damian Lillard"
"I just played a game in MyLeague between the Suns and 76ers.  DeAndre Ayton was called for the 3-sec violation but it was legit....I just forgot to move him while I watched the Sixers move the ball around.  But on the very next possession, Joel Embiid stood with both feet in the key and didn't move until he got the rebound, a good 12 seconds.  THAT I see all the time, and not just Embiid."
"Yes KAT and Joel Embiid last year, Kobe getting rocked, Garnett getting rocked, etc..."

It's rare in the NBA to have real beef outside the court nowadays.
"Partly also because people know KAT can easily be an MVP candidate if he’s more locked in. Case in point Joel Embiid, dude has seemingly ditch his troll mode on the court and look at what he has become this season"
"with Joel out, ball movement becomes much more important for that team, which is something he excels at - there is a reason the 76ers did very well while Embiid was out, Simmons doesn't have to score more to impact the team"
Joel Embiid came into the Zoom room? Probably violates Covid precautions.
Joel Embiid stopping KAT on a dime is a dangerous situation. Way too much energy being exchanged there
I remember an old coworker of mine tried to say Hassan Whiteside was MUCH better than Embiid and that Joel would be out of the league in 2 years due to injuries when Whiteside was still on the Heat
"I mean look I watch Embiid and I see how he plays. How he takes advantage of his speed advantage and his size advantage. How he uses his strength. Also how so many teams play him. The doubles are constant and that means more turnovers and more fouls. It's high risk high reward but it's better than getting bullied in the post.   I imagine double teaming someone who passes like Jokic isn't the smartest move. Although occasionally people double Ben in the post for some reason so idk maybe it does happen. But my point is Joel plays through a lot of contact. The crazy thing is Sixers fans, and coaches, and Joel himself knows that he gets fouled more than is called. But the refs can't call everything. Or at least choose not to.   Jokic reminds me of Tobias Harris. He drives a lot, shoots a ton of mid-range shots, but rarely goes to the line. Meanwhile Jimmy Butler lives at the line. Harris just avoids contact more than goes through it with strength. And he is shooting an amazing percentage so it's not like he's not doing well getting to his spots and shooting around contests. But he just is never gonna be a guy who goes to the line a bunch.  I watch Jokic games. But not nearly as many as you. But when I do watch him, I don't see him *driving* to the rim and laying it up through contact. I see him shooting jumpers and hook shots in the post. He has amazing touch and skill and uses that to score. I'm sure calls are missed on him, and I'm sure he gets some non-shooting calls as well. The bottom line is he has his own style of play that is working well. He's figured it out. And he is the frontrunner for MVP (and if they get the three seed, it's his) because of it."
“THAT IS A DISGUSTING ACT BY JOEL EMBIID”
"Shot distribution is not the same as playstyles. And if you're saying he's just as strong as Joel I'm not sure we can have a serious discussion. And of course, you say Embiid flops when he drives. Sure man why not. If you watch them both play and somehow think they play the same style then idk what to tell you."
"That’s not why your getting downvoted, it’s because you’re attributing it to “play styles” when their shot distribution is almost the same, Jokic actually has a higher percentage of his shots with 10ft of the basket as Joel and is just as strong. The difference is that Embiid prioritizes flopping over making baskets when he drives and is rewarded for ir"
me yesterday: Why has Joel Embiid thrusted so hard?
"Yea you live with KD taking mid rangers all game long because it will be crazy inefficient in terms of the full dataset of shots taken over the course of the game.  Ben won’t change the shots KD takes, but he will absolutely erase most of what harden does.  You have Joel as everyone’s help and you use Ben and Thybulle to shut down Irving and Harden.    Then on offense one of Harden/Harris HAS to be on Tobi/Ben in the low post, as well as no one on the nets can gaurd Embiid.  No matter what the sixers will get a good look on almost every possession.  People really like to overlook how good of a player Ben is in the low post and he legitimately brutalizes smaller mismatches for easy buckets until your PF has to gaurd him.  Which in turn makes it so now Harris has a size advantage on the SF/SG that now has to gaurd him in the low/high post, and if you double they have the shooting now to make you pay.  The sixers offense is honestly as unstoppable as it gets right now, they just don’t score as much as other teams because the way they play slows the game down."
&gt;Does anyone know other crazy positive +/- stats in which a player played an overwhelming percentage of a loss ?  Joel Embiid game 7 of the ECSF's.

happens when you go all out 100 percent of every game on BOTH SIDES OF THE FLOOR... Kat takes 50 percent of the game off and decides to guard danny green over joel because foul trouble from embiid lmfao.
"The Nets literally measured him 6' 10"" He was measured 6' 9.5"" in the combine measurements IIRC. He is barely taller than a 6' 9.5"" guy in his 80s: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfOGvzhWkAEqc-I.jpg  This is not how 7 footers look like  True 7 footers, even 6' 11"" guys are incredibly rare. In fact KG is one of them (a true 6' 11"") and people were calling him a liar (of his height). In fact he was the only honest man among a field of liars.  For some reason NBA players like to put an inch or two on their true height.  Again true 7 footers are incredibly rare. For example Joel Embiid is not a true 7 footer. You need to be taller even than him to be a true (measured from head to toe) one."
"Embiid routinely dominates KAT, so what does that say about him?    Plus, Joel is a multiple time All Star, multiple DPOY candidate and an MVP candidate.   Not bad for a ""soft"" center.   Maybe Towns should take lessons."

in terms of the top 4 centers... Joel/AD/Jokic/Towns... He is probably 2nd in terms of passing behind jokic. Embiid has come a long way but he could be better at it and will.
dunk was nasty good on embiid trying to nut up and block it over bitching out. That being said wolves fans and fans in general think towns scored 39 on joel when joel dominated towns and towns was covering green most of the game because joel put his ass in foul trouble  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=1626157&amp;VsPlayerID=203954](https://www.nba.com/stats/vs/advanced/#!?PlayerID=1626157&amp;VsPlayerID=203954)  &amp;#x200B;  check the stats.
"When everyone is healthy it is remarkably easy for the Sixers to get Harris mismatches in the post against significantly smaller players. Due in large part to the presence of Ben and Joel.   That being said, he was giving Kawhi and George buckets in the post. Seems like the only thing that has slowed him down this season is doubling. And that only *just* started happening the last few games before Embiid returned and obviously is not a thing anyone can or will do if Embiid is out there."
"That's Joel ""Do A 180"" Embiid to you, sir."
"People act like they have super different play styles, but they really don’t when scoring. Their offensive shot distribution and style is more similar than almost any other pairing of players in the league. Jokic actually takes a higher percentage of his shots within 10ft than Joel does, they’re both top 3 in post ups, and they have similar shooting splits.   FGA distribution by distance:  0-3ft: Embiid 20%, Jokic 23%  3-10ft: E 25% J 34%  10-16ft: E 24% J 15%  16-3pt: E 15% J 9%  3pt: E 16% J 19%  Jokic is one of the most physical and highest volume post players in the league. The biggest difference is that Embiid gets calls for running right into defenders and flailing his arms while Jokic prioritizes making shots over getting whistles.   Typical Embiid play: https://m.imgur.com/a/CpYlLs1  Typical Jokic non-call: https://streamable.com/d42rck"

"I swear you guys just see what you want to see, do you not see KAT gets crossed up? He moves with the ball to Joel's right, Joel crosses back to the left and then as Embiid initiates the gather KATs momentum goes towards Joel, literally a textbook blocking foul"
"No, I don't believe Joel Embiid is a cat. I could be wrong though."
Joel “Hingle McCringleberry” Embiid
"Joel ""The Narrative"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid out 4-6 weeks
"They have different playstyles. Joel knows either a double team or a foul is the only way anyone is stopping him and (the important part, here) he's smart enough to exploit the everloving shit out of that fact.  Jokic is thinking about a pass first and he's a savant at it. Embiid didn't really figure out (or didn't have the roster til now) to pass out of necessity when doubled until this season."
"u/sim888 in the playoffs or something, if someone shits on Embiid or talks shit I need them photoshopped onto KAT dunking on Joel lol"
"Nobody is arguing that Jokic should get more. The argument is that he shouldn’t be getting *less than half as many*. It’s not like Joel is at 10 and Jokic is at 8 or something, we’re talking 11.5 vs 4.7. Jokic is barely getting more than Schroeder lol, and that’s while he’s literally harder to stop than Embiid in the paint and restricted area."
Joel averaged 30/12 last playoffs. He just had zero help. If we have Bubble Playoffs Embiid then we're in pretty good shape.

"&gt;The way some people on here talk about jokic, you'd think he's by far and away the best center in the NBA. Like I'd take him over Embiid, but the gap is super small.  Obviously it depends on the team, but for right now with LBJ on the team, ill take Joel all day."
"I hate Joel Embiid so much, but, well...  (I actually don't hate him unless he's playing us.)"
"My guy Joel Embiid went from Russell Westbrook to Kevin Durant in terms of percentages, th doubt is warranted"
"They’re one Andrew Wiggins plus 7 picks for Joel Embiid trade away from competing, which is to say it’s not gonna happen and I think Steph knows that"
"Nah, Curry is gonna join his brother and fellow Under Armor representative Joel Embiid in Philly next season. He just texted me this information 10 minutes ago."
"Embiid was 2 years removed from playing any competitive basketball and dominated per minute coming off a foot injury on a trash team with barely any starting caliber players facing double teams. If Embiid put up rookie Wiseman numbers his rookie season, that's a win for him.  Joel was a better prospect than Wiseman. I am not expecting Wiseman to dominate, I am expecting him to show an NBA starting C skill. Mitchell Robinson was in a similar situation as Wiseman and balled out.  Is he a good rebounder, is he a good finisher. He's a legit 7 footer and he can't box out. He's a legit 7 footer and he isn't an impressive finisher.   Like, can Wiseman be prime Tyson Chandler as a rookie? All he has to do is finish plays and screen and box out. He can't do that right now and I am sure that's all he is expected to do for 18 to 24 mins.  Wiseman isn't expected to do much on the Warriors."
"The top 5 nba draft picks from from 2012-2016 (to weed out players who are still on rookie deals)  * 2012:  AD at 1, Brad Beal at 3, to be fair then Dame at 6. AD and Dame were All Stars quickly, but Beal didn't make an All-Star team until 2018 * 2013: Victor Oladipo made one all star game. A famously pretty bad draft,, though * 2014: Joel Embiid is a slam dunk. Meanwhile people are still waiting to see if Aaron Gordon figures it out, and it's taken Andrew Wiggins 6 years to (maybe) become a good player.  * 2015: KAT, DLo, Zinger all took a while and there are still big questions surrounding all of them.  * 2016: Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, and Jaylen Brown all look to be good players but have also all had weird paths to get where they are now.    My point in all of that even top 5 picks are rarely immediately good. It usually takes a couple of seasons to really know what you have, especially when they're entering the league at 18 years old."
a team like the nets could defininitely use him imo. They should also use if to defend joel embiid. They'll get very good results!
"Aight, so half of this is just straight BS, and the other half is iffy at best, so let's just leave it instead. Let's celebrate our monster bigs instead.  *But*, let's just adress the most ridiculous parts first.  Joel Embiid is clearly the single best defender on the Sixers, and clearly better than all the ones you mention except for Gobert. Simmons is getting DPOY hype because he's so good and versatile for his position, and he had a hard time getting DPOY traction earlier in the season because of how he is still not the best defender on the team.  And I'm not sure I should need to tell you this, but free throws are not an inconsistent way of scoring, especially not when you're a big player mostly earning them through hard contact. The current foul baiting problems are partly because of how consistent FTs are. If you're 2/10 from the floor and 15/15 from the line, you are objectively having an efficient game. I'm sure you know that shooting many FTs is a great way to bump up your efficiency, as in your true shooting and not FG%, which is just a wildly misleading stat to use in this case (and in most cases). And yes, having one other player on your entire team shoot better than 5% below league average TS% won't help your stats nor your turnovers (and it is also the reason you're getting triple teamed, not because you're bad at scoring). But passing has been a previous problem for Embiid."
If Thon Makur is international then add Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons to the list.  Thon Makur moved to the states in 8th grade and has been playing ever since.
Joel Embiid when he got in that fight with KAT. He posted some comments on KATs status and deleted them and took a screenshot literally seconds after posting them so it looked like KAT got sensitive and deleted joels comments. He got caught quickly

"Since Joel Embiid has been sidelined, Ben's shooting 45% from the field and 53% from the FT line.  In their recent 6 game roadtrip, he only shot 41% from the field and averaged 5 apg.  Tobias, Green and Shake have been better than Ben since Jo got sidelined."
"Embiid faces up too. But your main point is correct, Embiid knows how to draw fouls posting up or facing the basket.  When Embiid faces the basket and a defender drops his arms, JoJo immediately does a rip through for a foul call.  People complain that it's cheap, but than they complain when they're guys don't get calls. Joel especially when he posts up, if he puts a couple fouls on his defender first it helps him take less abuse."
"We do actually watch Embiid.  Jokic shoots *more* inside shots *and more* midrange shots than Embiid - this isn't about an imbalance in playing styles.  Per NBA.com shooting split stats for the current season:  Shots from 0-5 feet: Jokic 206/311, Joel 110/116  Shots from 5-9 feet: Jokic 119/197, Joel 34/86  Shots from 10-14 feet: Jokic 48/108, Joel 53/114  Shots from 15-19 feet: Jokic 50/90, Joel 46/85  So no, it's not how the game is called on all big men. It might be that is how the game is called for all big men when they are playing down low, but that doesn't change the fact that Jokic is clearly not getting calls that Embiid is getting in the mid range.  And Jokic obviously flops, so it's not like he isn't selling it like Embiid."

"Made him look like Joel Embiid on defense and Nikola Jokic on offense lmao, dude just worked us in the post and whenever we sent a weakass double he found his shooter/cutter immediately. I don't doubt he'll be good for the Nets but I'm very curious to see how he looks with Harden back against teams actually somewhat prepared to play defense."
"My guy if Joel lost his quickness I think Brook is his closest resemblance. Both of them are drop coverage bigs (Embiid can step out, but hasn’t) in the playoffs"
By that logic Joel Embiid should never be double teamed
"Jokic is not in the same tier as Lillard, AD and Embiid holistically. He’s better than Dame and AD just generally and Joel gets hurt every year"
Joel Embiid is on your team lol. Stfu
"I’ll give you Jokic over Embiid tbh, Joel needs to prove himself in the playoffs, but did you see what Luka did vs the clippers in his first playoff series? He averaged 31/10/9 on 60% TS and hit a buzzer beater. While AD averaged 28/10/4 while anchoring the defense to win a title. You can argue LeBron was the best player on that team but they were definitely 1A/1B."
"Next up: ""Joel Embiid tonight had 0 points Harden MVP"""
"It’s not a flaw, and it’s the kind of thing that can change with more visibility. People acting like it’s just because of his playstyle are the problem. Like when people say he gets fouled less than Embiid because Embiid is harder to stop in the paint, even though Jokic literally has a higher FG% in the paint and restricted area than Joel. He is objectively more unstoppable than Embiid (even when 25%+ of his misses aren’t wiped away with a whistle), but people act like it’s bc he isn’t physical enough lol."
Joel Embiid       ...said nobody ever
Joel Embiid moves pretty well.
"Well before 3/30 his odds were +950 which I would say is definitely not in the running. Now at +550 he is about as likely to win as Joel Embiid, who is injured lol.  Sounds a lot like you don't understand."
"Who, Joel Embiid? Lol"
"he drafted Joel Embiid and put them into position to draft Ben Simmons  did a ton of smaller shit along the margins (amassing future picks, taking a chance on and starting the development some legit future players like Covington and Grant) but the first point is the whole picture  he put the team in position to have 2 star level players in 3 years of management, that’s all you can ask"
&gt;Who isn't a raptor killer this season?  Joel embiid
*[PHI] Joel Embiid*
"&gt; He adds that, for both tweets, all proceeds will go to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the same organization to which he sends his Cameo proceeds. He has hinted at this before, too, when he tagged the now-deleted Tokenized Tweets in a hilarious picture he snapped of Joel Embiid."
Was curious about clutch minutes. This is the list:  1. Damian Lillard - 135 (77.7% TS) 2. Zach LaVine - 116 (58.4% TS) 3. De'Aaron Fox - 106 (56.9% TS) 4. James Harden - 98 (69.8% TS) 5. Nikola Jokic - 94 (59.2% TS) 6. Chris Paul - 87 (59.0% TS) 7. Jerami Grant - 83 (57.2% TS) 8. Joel Embiid - 80 (65.3% TS) 9. DeMar DeRozan - 74 (61.0% TS) 10. LeBron James - 74 (55.6% TS)
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
"Bucks gotta be my pick.  - Draft Joel Embiid in 2014 (over Jabari Parker)  - Draft Domantas Sabonis in 2016 (over Thon Maker)  - Draft Norman Powell and OG Anunoby (with the picks they traded for Greivis Vazquez)  - Hold onto Malcolm Brogdon (instead of letting him go to the Pacers)  That's a lineup of: Brogdon / Middleton / Anunoby / Antetokounmpo / Embiid, which Powell &amp; Sabonis off the bench."

Rudy gobert is a top 5 defender in the league no argument  Your saying he’s not one because he can’t guard the top bigs well who tf can Anthony Davis can’t guard Joel Embiid so I guess he isn’t a good defender   Basically what I’m saying when your going against a superstar or elite scorers it’s a team effort on defense   also Rudy not just a shot blocker he’s actually the best rim protector in the league and rim protecting is not all about getting blocks there’s more to it   And who the hell keep coming up with the stupid that gobert is useless out the paint he’s still a average perimeter defender
So do Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis
Turns out he was the best indeed only Joel Embiid being arguably better at is very arguable.
"Yeah, Joel averages 63% of a season and has never played even 80%. They were drafted in the same year but Jokic has played 5,854 more minutes. It would be one thing is Embiid just had one or two freak injuries like Hayward or PG, but he’s literally gotten hurt every season of his career. That’s a big issue."
"If Joel had a choice he would've gone back the next game after the injury. He already sonned Myles and Gobert, the top 2 DPOY candidates, if he wanted to duck any duels it would've been those two. The Jokic and Embiid brawl will be firepower and playmaking vs defense and post-domination.   Happy Cake day."
Joel Embiid   7’0 280 lbs 37 inch vert  Trae Young   6’1 180 lbs can’t dunk
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
Burr vs Joel Embiid. The people demand it
Yeah do you have anything to say about why he gets fouled more off ball than other players?  Like do you think when dudes are fighting for position against Joel Embiid they don't hold him?  That's just part of basketball when you're a dominant offensive player and Steph gets treated like a superstar 90% of the time by the officials exactly like you would expect.
Here are a couple reasons:  1. Lebron James and Anthony Davis 2. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George 3. Kevin Durant and James Harden 4. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid
"Simmons' career record without Embiid is 33-31. In a vacuum that is not a playoff team in the West but is in the East.   However, that is taking the best player off the team, if you would hypothetically replace Joel with an average to slightly above average starting center like Valenciunas or Myles Turner and it isn't crazy to assume he would take a team to the playoffs as the best player.   Simmons, Tucker, Wood, Gordon, Wall can absolutely make the playoffs in the West."
"Probably an unpopular take to my fellow Sixer fans. I'm okay with Jokic getting the MVP. He's the closest to Joel anyway plus missing a bunch of games really doesn't help Joel's case. But you're right, this is unless the Nuggets suddenly start collapsing while Embiid getting back and carrying his team to wins."
"Most dominant paint force since shaq, Joel embiid has entered the chat"
"they couldn't build a championship team paying james harden $35m but they're going to do it paying $35m to ben simmons  get real, not everyone has joel embiid"
"Good, yeah. Elite? I don't know about that. I think of Rudy Gobert or Joel Embiid when I hear elite rim protector."
Comparing Bill Russell to Wilt Chamberlain is like comparing Draymond Green to Joel Embiid. We all know Joel Embiid is better.
"Hard to say when it comes to Tony Bradley since they were teammates, but Celtics (and by extension Theis) have not been able to stop Embiid https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-stats-by-game-against-celtics. Giannis has fared well against the Celtics too. https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-stats-vs-boston-celtics"
Should the Sixers take Joel Embiid if they already have Nerlens Noel?
Joel Embiid is being forced to do a face-turn despite being one of the NBA's best heels.
"Of course he wouldn't turn shit around, he's an old ass Aldridge not Joel Embiid, let the man be 😂"
"Joel Embiid. Absolutely dominant close to the basket, but can score from anywhere. His shot is the wettest I’ve ever seen from a guy his size.  Obviously I’m biased, but it really looks like he’s playing a different game out there sometimes. Like he’s in a separate weight class from the rest of the NBA."
"I think it's silly that most other fans shrugged off them getting KD, Kyrie and Harden, but now they need to be broken up because they signed Blake and LA, but LA definitely won't be 'useless' either.   He's a bench piece. He gives you 6 fouls and a threat from the midrange and 3 point. People keep saying 'How are they going to stop Embiid or Giannis?' as if anybody is going to stop those two. They aren't. Rudy Gobert took his best shot at being an Embiid stopper and Joel wiped his ass with Rudy's family portrait. That's not the play you make.  Instead you focus on being the most overwhelming force you can possibly be. If Giannis or Embiid go off for 85 points a night 4x in a series, well...hats off to you.  But the Nets should not fall into the trap that they're going to stop those guys."

"C'mon man, Embiid got bodied by Adams in their recent matchup, right in the middle of his insane stretch. Shaq would have absolutely no problem with Joel, he'd be dunking on him all game....the only issue he would have is Joel's range, but that's all Joel would be doing, shooting mid range and threes cause he aint getting into the paint with LA prime Shaq."

Not really lol. The man can drop 30 on 14 shots if he wanted. And not the Joel Embiid or James Harden method either.  No one can guard him
Is Joel Embiid screwed then?
Joel Embiid long term booking
Jason Tatum age 23 games played 278 Joel Embiid age 27 games played 250
&gt;Joel Embiid nearly won his rookie year playing 34 out of 82 games.  No. He literally didn't.  Brogdon got 414 points.  Saric got 266 points.  Embiid finished with 177 points.  Stop being delusional.
Do you not realize that games played matters way less  for ROY? Joel Embiid nearly won his rookie year playing 34 out of 82 games. Stop it.
"&gt;It’s really not lol. The MVP isn’t determined by who has the most player of the week awards, or who has the most star of the night awards (since years are made out of weeks, and weeks are made out of days).  It’s a cumulative and all encompassing award. Meaning not all “months” are weighted equally.   Why do y’all keep making this argument? The criteria for these awards are completely different. Joel Embiid played 34 games his rookie year and nearly won the award missing 60% of the season because he was that good. Games player matters way less for ROY. I know u want your guy to win but using the games played argument as if this is the MVP award is not doing anything for this particular award when the difference in quality of play is this stark."
"As a big Embiid fan, I can't see any rational argument for Joel getting the MVP over Jokic.  Jokic has *much* higher offensive participation due to &gt;2X Embiid's assists, hasn't missed a single game, and has overall just been incredibly consistent."
"Once you get in with the general stuff in the nba, id recommend watching even games that seem boring. For example i like the sixers and Joel embiid and i watch every game, even the ones that seem lame like vs the rockets beecause you'll really see how the defense and offense get effected by good vs bad teams."
"&gt; I)  The subtle magic of Stephen Curry  How do you get open when all five defenders are focused on you? We know the common methods. Curry can roast his guy one-on-one, leveraging the threat of the most accurate jumper in league history. He can use a screen from Draymond Green, rumbling into open space more often now with James Wiseman injured -- and the Warriors playing more with Green at center.  Those two make such magic together. What they have is really why we follow basketball. It is what every player searches for, but few find: a hoops soulmate who amplifies your game, sees the floor through your eyes, and reads your intentions the moment you do. Some of their greatest mutual highlights are the product of improvisation -- tweaking some tried-and-true action at the last second because of something only they visualize.  But one of my favorite Steph-isms, on full brilliant display during this incandescent month, is the game of hide-and-seek Curry plays in the chaos of transition.  He seems disinterested, casual. Then he stops and turns his back to the rim. What? Is he setting a back screen? It looks that way. That's not it, though. Curry spies Alex Len loitering near the paint -- far from his man (Kevon Looney). What Curry is really doing is waiting for Looney. Once Looney arrives, Curry slips behind him.  Curry sprints diagonally, and right into Jayson Tatum. As he makes contact, Curry motions for Andrew Wiggins to pop out -- as if that's the plan. Nope. Wiggins cuts to the rim, and both defenders follow him. Green finishes the con job with a glance at Wiggins before shoveling to Curry.  Curry is one of one. The league has never seen this level of on-ball potency and off-ball relentlessness in the same player. Most churning off-ball rovers run around the way they do because they can't do much with the ball. They need to catch it at the right angle, with the right amount of space, to get their shots off. Curry can contort himself into a triple from anywhere, anytime. There are no boundaries to his creativity.  That is so calculated. Curry goes right around that first Green pick. Green is open. The pass is there. But Curry senses that by reversing course, he can drag Davis Bertans a few extra feet from Kent Bazemore -- and craft an easier shot.  Curry probably isn't winning MVP if the Warriors finish around .500, but he has planted himself in the conversation. As of now, I would guess the three names to appear on the most ballots would be Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, and Curry.  But Curry's magnificent season is more important for what it portends. He has reestablished himself as a first-team All-NBA-level player. He is already something beyond a franchise icon. Golden State owes Curry an honest effort at chasing championships over the next three seasons.  The biggest question in the league -- the one the Warriors must ask themselves each day -- is how close they are with Green, Curry, and Klay Thompson returning from two devastating injuries, and their current supporting cast. The answer depends in part on external variables: Who might rise and fall in the West? But factoring in age-related decline for all three stars and rust for Thompson, the safest assumption is the Warriors need something else to pop.  It might not have to be something huge -- the addition of another star via some megatrade that would involve one or both of Wiseman and the shiny Minnesota Timberwolves pick Golden State owns. It could be internal growth from a couple of key guys, including Wiseman making a huge leap soon.  Regardless: This Curry -- this destroyer -- demands prioritizing the immediate future."

Just stop it bro. Before Joel went down with the bone bruise it was pretty much a consensus that he was playing the best ball in the league.   Only r/nba would pretend like Jokic was better the whole season when he *literally* only passed Embiid once he went down with injury
"No way. First, the only similarities between Embiid, Jokic, and Ming is that they're tall. That's where the similarities end. Joel Embiid would absolutely DOMINATE Yao Ming in today's NBA and so would Jokic. Players like Yao Ming struggle just to see time on the floor in today's NBA. You either need to be 1) be able to hit mid-range shots at a high clip or hit 3's, or 2) be a really versatile defender and be able to at least not get embarrassed picking up someone on the perimeter. Yao Ming wasn't good at either one of those things. In some ways, Dwight Howard is one of the last traditional bigs in the league but even he had to basically abandon what made him a force in the NBA to extend his career. Today, bigs need to be more like Joel Embiid or KAT than they do Yao Ming. Even Shaq would have to adjust in today's NBA despite what he will tell you. Just ask Roy Hibbert. From the ECF to out of the league in less than 5 years without a single major injury attributing to his early departure. The way players utilize the pick and roll, and the number of bigs that actually participate in the pick-and-pop.. it would just be devastating for someone like Yao Ming. He ain't built for this."
Ironically they’re better as a pair. Embiid opens the floor for Simmons and they can’t put a center on Ben if Joel is on the block. Likewise Ben always knows how to get it to Joel for entry passes and on defense they’re incredible together
"Jokic is literally allowing fewer points per possession vs the PnR than Embiid this year (https://twitter.com/danemoorenba/status/1379905554248765443?s=21) and was last year as well, he’s a better PnR defender than Embiid and has been ever since he stopped dropping. Joel did get shredded pretty badly by CP3 and Curry in the PnR, he was dropping too far and giving them way too much space, they got a lot of easy buckets from it.     Also no, Jokic’s defense really hasn’t gotten exploited in the playoffs. AD scored less and less efficiently against him in the WCF than against Bam in the Finals, and we held the Clippers to less than 100ppg on average the last 4 games. If Jokic was getting exploited the Nuggets wouldn’t be one 4OT game from back to back WCF appearances in a much harder Western conference, including beating the preseason title favorites last year in the Clippers.   And the answer is that you hard double Embiid in the post, where he remains an absolute liability on offense. The Sixers have just a 97.7 ORTG when Joel is hard doubled in the post this year which is terrible, especially for a team whose offense is so reliant on his post scoring, and when they basically become a 4v5 when Simmons doesn’t have the ball, making him even easier to double.    It’s legit hilarious you’d use the “you guys need to realize this is the regular season” line when Jokic has been in a completely different tier than Embiid in the playoffs thus far in their careers. Embiid has a heavily lopsided assist/to ratio and is a career 43% shooter in the playoffs, and has been exploited extensively on offense because he’s a ball stopper with arguably the worst court vision of any NBA superstar- like last year where he averaged 3x more TOs than assists on poor shooting splits, or against Toronto where he wasn’t even the best player on his own team and still put up only 17.6/8.7/3 with 28 TOs and putrid 37/34/84 shooting splits (never shooting better than 50% in a game). Only one of these players is a chronic underperformer in the playoffs (with causation) thus far, and it isn’t Jokic."
Joel The Reacher Embiid
"I just want to know who KP is better or more talented  than Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic, Mitchell, Gobert, Booker, CP3."
I don't even think he is too tall and lanky for the low post. If he just had a KG/Joel Embiid type shimmy fade away it would be unstoppable. For some reason though he just tries to face up every time and it makes getting clean looks off more difficult.
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
"&gt;Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic. These are the players at the top of my head that are all better than KP  Mitchell, Gobert, Paul, Booker, KAT"
"Lebron, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph, AD, Dame, Joel Embiid, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Luka, Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Bradley Beal, Russ, Lavine, Vucevic. These are the players at the top of my head that are all better than KP"
"facts. I'm a Celtics fan and there's a reason y'all are 3-0 against us on the year, and that reason is Joel fucking embiid."
Bobby Portis Jr. has a stronger MVP argument than Joel Embiid.
"I agree Steph shouldn't win MVP, it's Jokic's to lose. Given all the injuries to everyone else, I might even go as far to say it should be unanimous. However, I do think Steph should at least be a (distant) top 3 candidate along with Giannis or Joel Embiid.   And fwiw I thought Kawhi should have won MVP because his team won like 61 games that year (behind only the Warriors). But Russ, Harden, Kawhi were the clear top 3 candidates and I had no problem with any of them."
"yes narratives must be followed. joel embiid has missed a lot of games. jokic hasnt missed any.   stop being suggestive. just say what you want to say.   its all bs anyway  hate this beat around the bush suggesting implanting narratives into peoples heads  influencing bullshit.   say what youre saying, speak up"
"Joel ""polar bear"" Embiid"
It feels like it's the Bucks vs Joel Embiid. Nobody other than Joel is really doing anything today.
"Joel Embiid, Ed Reed, Rasheed Wallace  Don't matter to me, Orlando in 4"
The thing is that Joel Embiid takes a ton of jumpers lmao. Half of his field goal attempts come from beyond 10 feet.
"&gt;its not like Jokic is only the front runner because of time missed.   Joel was ahead of Jokic for weeks leading up to his bone bruise. So yes, Jokic is only the front runner because of time missed. Joel's injury is literally the point in which he overtook Embiid and its the only reason he still has the lead  &gt;This is so far from the truth   Bill Walton won MVP in '78 playing 71% of the games (58/82)"
Joel Embiid is going to sit on our court I'm calling it now and I'm ready for it
"Does Jokic really deserve MVP when it's an open secret that Joel would be in the lead if he missed just 5 less games?  I find it strange that people are disqualifying Joel Embiid from the MVP discussion, when there is precedent for winning the award playing ~75% of the games"
"Well Joel Embiid just said shaq's comments affected his improvement, and he's pretty close with Joel Embiid, so it might be true"
"Bro I literally never mentioned Jokic. Jokic is winning the MVP idk why people who clearly want him to do the thing he is going to do are so upset. It's a mere formality at this point. LeBron and Embiid have missed too many games, same with Harden.   Jokic fans should be happy for his award and excited for the playoffs. If Embiid hadn't missed any games and everyone else had, I would be happy for Joel that he was gonna win the award. Not salty all day about other players hyping themselves up. I bet Jokic doesn't care that Steph and Embiid think they're the MVP."
"There's not one season in their careers where Jokic has scored like Embiid. Joel Embiid averages 25 ppg in his career, Jokic averages 18 ppg. Saying he could just decide to score more is like me saying Embiid could just decide to pass more and get more assists.   If you think Jokic is a ""much better offensive player"" because of his scoring and passing then I assume you think he's a better offensive player than Steph Curry? Because Steph is scoring one point more than Embiid but Jokic is almost averaging three more assists per game than Curry."
"Steph: I'm the MVP  r/nba: what a guy every top player should think like this 😍  Embiid: I'm the MVP  r/nba: lmao what a dumbass go fuck yourself  I didn't even care about the MVP race when Joel was in front but come on guys, really living up to this subs reputation here"
"26 points to 30 points is not miniscule. That's four more points. Which is a hell of a lot at that level. Bradley Beal leads the NBA at 31 ppg, if Joel scored four more ppg he'd average 34 ppg and would which is James Harden MVP territory.   You can say Jokic is more valuable on offense due to his role as primary facilitator in the Nuggets offense. But there's no need to act like Jokic scores at the same rate as Embiid, either throughout their careers or this season.   Also as I'm going to start doing whenever replying to a Nuggets fan about Jokic, this is a friendly reminder that Jokic will win the MVP and there's nothing anyone else can do about it. Congratulations."
"KD has won rings and had playoff success   What has Joel Embiid actually accomplished?  Even Herro got to the Finals 🤣  Don’t put KD and Embiid in the same sentence boy, Embiid should stay humble"
If you are Kyle Kuzma or Tyler Herro - you should be humble. If you are Joel Embiid or Kevin Durant or anybody of this caliber - you shouldn't.
"If your MVP:  -Played less games than LeBron James, who's been injured for a month  -Can't hit full court buzzer beaters (Jokic def would've hit that SMH LeEmbiid)  -Has a better supporting cast than almost every other MVP candidate  -Went through a Mickey Mouse rebuild   Your MVP is Joel Embiid"
Joel Embiid if he could consistently shoot full court one handed 3’s

"That's actually untrue (as Zion, Mike Conley and others with some clutch games under their belt).   Plus there are player way more impactful, but as usual fans/mediocre media personnel, just watch on raw stats... look at the Net Rating or the TS% or even the PIE (not a great stats in general). Dame Lillard and Joel Embiid are beast out there."
"&gt; There is a grand canyon sized gap between Popovich and those 2 coaches.   At the end of the day, it is about the players and buying into the system and that is exactly what you have in these situations.  &gt;It had 3 hall of famers  3 slightly washed HoF'ers and 1 future HoF. I just got through watching Joel Embiid dominate the Suns. When I watched him, Joel Embiid was doing Joel Embiid things to the Suns like a superstar. It isn't like you had Tim Duncan doing superstar things that playoff and winning. You had a great team play great winning ball making every possession on both sides of the ball count and that is exactly what you have with the Suns and Jazz this year.   &gt; great depth  Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson have been pretty damn great. The Suns Cam Johnson and Cam Payne have been pretty damn great. In terms of [net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench&amp;sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1), the Suns have the highest net rating bench in the league while the Utah Jazz are also in the top 5 at number 4. Both of these teams have excellent depth.  &gt;They haven't yet earned that status.  That is the whole point of trying to predict things. It is easy to say someone is a championship player after they are Champion. Everyone can say who is the championship team after the season and the post season is over.   &gt;Regular season is nice  Regular season is the best predictor of post season.  &gt;they need to both prove they can get out of the 1st and 2nd round first.  Great, ya ok lets talk about which team won after they won then. The 2020 Lakers are a Championship team. Bold statement, I know."
"Come on dude, you are probably the laziest bitch the world has ever seen.  The most important thing in Basketball is being tall, you at least could have made it overseas.  Giannis Antetokounmpo is a soccer reject who started to play Basketball at the age of 13 in a country with 0 Basketball infrastructure and look where he is.  Joel Embiid started to play at the age of 15 in Africa, a continent with even less Basketball infrastructure than Greece and look where he is.  You are just extremely lazy."
Joel Embiid 0/0 ZERO points in two meetings. Absolutely clamped him!
"*In the 2021 NFL Draft, the Philadelphia Eagles select Joel Embiid, Quarterback*"
Chris Paul in my opinion has been the front runner for mvp these last 3 seasons. Getting to fifth on all time assists is a bonus. It will go to Jokic though and I guess that's the 2nd best choice. Jokic has made the Nuggets a playoff contender. I just hope it doesn't go to Joel Embiid.
Joel “despite the loss” Embiid
"I honestly couldn't be more satisfied with a loss. Down Simmons, Tobi, and Seth, fight for 48 minutes and barely lose to one of the best teams in the league at full strength. Matisse put on a defensive clinic vs. Booker, Hill started picking it up towards the end, can't be too upset.   I am so glad Joel Embiid plays for the Sixers."
Joel Embiid is the new favorite for the Eagles starting QB.
"I figured someone would mention spacing, that’s what Curry and Klay are for. Dray may not be a wing threat anymore and the paint would be too packed but again that’s why you have the two greatest 3pt shooters of all time, plus Joel Embiid. Replacing Simmons with DG would fix it but I’m still certain spacing wouldn’t be an issue with that starting 5"
Buddy I love Embiid. I'll just let you have this one because you put a lot of effort into it. Go Joel.
Yup that's the Joel Embiid experience
Embiid can't just use his strength all the time against guys like Ayton who are built like brick shit houses. Where's that dream shake Joel? Get some finesse game going
In the words of r/nba  Joel Embiid  Posts like young Shaq  Shoots like old Dirk  Dreamy footwork like Hakeem  Rings like Barkley
"I love Joel Embiid. He's yet to prove he can play &gt;75% of a season, despite his youth. He's unlikely going to be a dominating superstar at 30."
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"Whether you hate it or not, Embiid is one of the greatest centers of the modern-day NBA. I agree with Kerr; Joel is a unique player; his only downside is that he is an injury-prone player, which will give him only a handful of years left to compete in his prime."
My time to shine!  Joel Embiid is pretty good at basketball
"And he, as a 6'3 guard, totally shut down 7 footers  Joel Embiid and KAT, as well as AD, so thoroughly that they posted 0/0/0 lines. What a monster"
"Joel Embiid is pretty good at basketball, I have to say, as an avid basketball watcher myself"
Embiid gets to the free throw line more (per 100 possessions) than any modern player.  |Rk|Player|FTA| |-:|:-|-:| |1|Joel Embiid|14.2| |2|Shaquille ONeal|13.9| |3|Karl Malone|12.7| |4|James Harden|12.5| |5|Dwight Howard|12.4| |6|Corey Maggette|12.4| |7|David Robinson|12.3| |8|Alonzo Mourning|11.9| |9|Leon Powe|11.7| |10|DeMarcus Cousins|11.4| |11|Allen Iverson|11.3| |12|Dwyane Wade|10.9| |13|Charles Barkley|10.8| |14|Kobe Bryant|10.7| |15|LeBron James|10.7|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 4/21/2021.
"Speaking of players who are “touted as one of the best players yet can’t even play a full season,” Joel Embiid has entered the chat"
"Are Shaq and Wilt playing currently in this era which is way different than the 90s? Like I said just take the easy example. Wilt played 48 mins a game when he was playing (and 40+ constantly). Just because “he’s Wilt”, there is NO WAY any coach would allow that to happen in today’s game. They don’t even allow LBJ to do that. So saying “he’s Wilt” is meaningless when trying to put him in the modern game, which is my point.   There are only two great Cs that teams are building 100% squarely around and that’s Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. As I said, he would only average that many if he had Jokic like skills where he could also play on the perimeter/shoot 3s/pass facing the basket. In Embiid’s case, he could never average that many since the ball is in Ben Simmons’ hands too much. For someone like KAT, they have a ton of younger players like DLo or Ant that get the ball too much."
Do we consider defence in an MVP candidate—I think we do. A two game difference in games played is pretty much a wash. Kyrie is below Embiid in the MVP conversation because Joel is an excellent defender.
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19. Bam Adebayo 20. Donovan Mitchell  21. Kyrie Irving 22. Ben Simmons 23. Rudy Gobert  24.  Jamal Murray  25. Zion Williamson  26. Trae Young  27. Zach LaVine 28. Russell Westbrook  29. Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"It is easily for embiid, but I'm not sure about offensively. I'd still give the nod to Joel but , despite not being as good of a scorer, cousins was a far superior passer and post possessions that run through him would lead to more open shots than embiid. I think the lack of shooting the pels diminished both AD and boogies value. But yeah Embiid easily"
"After The nets sweep the lakers in the finals for the next 2 years, I want KD to move to Milwaukee with Joel embiid and do it again just to see lebron fans seethe again at how a guy who is a “bottom end top 10 player” keeps beating bron."
playoff god joel embiid
"As of today, Nikola Jokic has played 760 more minutes than Joel Embiid"
"I love how all of a sudden Embiid is eligible again and Lebron still isnt, even tho Lebrons still played more games this year than Joel."

nope... Joel actually does it both ways.. Jokic tonight with those stat line didnt face half as many double or triple teams as joel tonight and joel played a better opponent... Imagine if joel only face 1v1s what he would do daily all while just ignoring the defensive end like jokic...  Jokic is damn good but he isnt on embiid/curry/durant or lebrons level sorry
He's nimble too.  You'd think he'd be immobile with his size but he can get around the court well enough to be able to make plays that guys his size normally wouldn't be able to make.  I made an argument a few weeks ago that we should wait for the playoffs to see who is going to be more effective but I think at this point it would be disrespectful to not have Jokic above Embiid.  Jokic might not have the same 2-way ability as Joel but in an age where offense is so important I have to give the edge to the Joker.
Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  James Harden  LeBron James  Luka Doncic  Damian Lillard  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard
"Tonight's games and performances from Embiid, Curry, and Jokic drastically hinder Embiid's MVP chances imo.  All we've been hearing from Embiid these past few weeks is how he should be MVP due to his consistent dominance and the Sixers being top seed in the east.  Tonight, the short-handed Sixers played the short-handed Warriors and Steph out-MVP'd Embiid.  Joel disappeared down the stretch because he had trouble with double teams and getting into his spots.  Embiid also did an interview on ESPN with Stephan A before the game tonight and said he should be MVP because ""When Shaq won MVP in 2000 he averaged 29 and 11 and those are my numbers right now"".  Well Shaq averaged 33 points, 15.8 rebs, and 3.4 blocks against Dikembe Mutombo in the 2001 NBA finals.  In the 1995 Finals against Hakeem he averaged 28 points, 12.5 rebs, 6.3 asts, and 2.5 blocks.  But Embiid cant figure out how to score on Kevon Looney or a 6'7 Draymond?  If a post-prime Marc Gasol is your kryptonite you can't compare yourself to Shaq.  Meanwhile Jokic, who also has a short-handed team, dropped 47 points, 15 rebs, and 8 asts in a close OT win on the same night.  This is the kind of stuff that sticks in voter's minds.  Doesn't help that Embiid played on national TV tonight too."
"And Jokic has won 4/5 most recent Philly-Denver matchups, ask Joel why he missed 3 of those. Certainly not Jokic’s fault he can’t stay on the court. And Embiid is shooting 31% vs Jokic in his career, far from dominant.   You’re using a h2h record that includes games where Jokic wasn’t even a starter btw."
"He's already like a billion times better than MC fuckin W lol,  and injuries are a risk for absolutely every player. Joel Embiid got maxed. Simmons got maxed.   Who else replaces 22/10 on elite of the elite efficiency with room to improve?  And go scope some Aaron Gordon to nuggets threads, it gets talked about a ton"
"Embiid dropping on the pick and roll is the reason they lost. Curry dribbled into 3 open (by Curry standards) threes in the last 5 minutes simply because Embiid was planted in the paint on that high pick and roll.  I don't care if you're Joel Embiid or prime Shaq. If you can't get on that pick and roll and stop Curry from dribbling into a three, then you can't be on the court against him. There's no amount of post dominance that can make up for a guy who hits over 50% on off-the-dribble threes 28 feet from the basket.   Curry breaks basketball. You simply cannot guard him like you do any other guard in the history of the NBA."
Looney did pretty great on D against Embiid as well. Imagine Joel going for 40+ tonight if they had Wiseman on him at any point.
"Why are you so afraid of real +- and would rather use an estimated? Because that doesn't fir your narrative maybe? Because Joel is almost doubling jokics, while averaging more points in 3 less minutes? How about opponet fg%? Blocks?steals? I find it adorable how you ignore the thousands of stats embiid is DOMINANT in and use and estimated stat lmao."
"&gt; Lmaoooo 4.8 def raptor vs .7 def raptor?  But the O-RAPTOR gap is even bigger  &gt; Steph curry is ahead of Joel in epm.... so his defensive gap must be pretty small compared to Joel too huh? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Sure, Curry &gt; Embiid seems plausible. I don't have a strong position either way.   &gt; Do you even remember the argument you made?  My original argument was that LaMelo could be ROY despite missing games. Then you brought up Jokic vs. Embiid, which I don't think is a comparable situation because Jokic and Embiid are pretty close when healthy (and I'd personally take Jokic over healthy Embiid). When healthy, no one was close to LaMelo."
I thoroughly enjoyed that battle between the leading 2021 NBA MVP candidate and Joel Embiid! But fr Steph is on another planet right now
"Biggest Joel Embiid fan here -&gt; give Curry the MVP, give him his flowers man."
I think out all the leagues the most secure is the NBA. They have an incredible globalized market.m with their top 3 MVP candidates all from different countries. They also have one of the youngest demographics amongst viewership and the sport itself is incredibly tantalizing. There will be no greater sporting experience than watching Joel Embiid do the shit in person that you and I can only do in video games.
"Bill Walton won MVP when he missed 29% of the season, beating out George Gervin who played in all 82 games that year!!!   Joel Embiid is absolutely the engine for the Sixers. It's frankly absurd for you to say that he ""is most definitely not the engine in that team."""
"Embiid has missed 25% of the season already, numbers are historic for both of them, you would think playing every single game and carrying the team on your back with multiple key players hurt and his other superstar playing hurt most of the season would get you the definite edge.  it was close before , like I said with Joel having the edge but after 18 games missed yea no contest there.  Also jokic might be the first big man ever to average a triple double which is just absolutely bananas, Joel is most definitely not the engine in that team, if jokic goes down the nuggets will be much worse than the sixers would be with Joel down.  Also I mentioned hate because people media and lots of fans seem to have something against the guy for whatever reason, acting like he’s the mvp purely because of other injuries when before it was pretty clear it was embiid first, him second in a very cool close race. I hate the fact that embiid got injured this was supposed to be one of the most exciting mvp races , what a shame."
Lol Joel Embiid alone is not gonna be enough to beat such a powerhouse Nets team. Your second best scorer is Tobias Harris and your second best overall player would be the fourth best player on the Nets.
I mean I'm not suggesting that he did amazing against Embiid but the first half DJ held Joel to 6/16 shooting which wasn't great. Joel did much better in the second half (7/13) but DJ didn't play as much then.
"~~The Romans~~ Adam Silver crucified our savior, ~~Jesus Christ~~ Sam Hinkie but ~~Christians~~ Joel Embiid conquered ~~the Romans~~ Adam Silver in ~~Jesus'~~ Sam's memory through the power of ~~religion~~ the one seed."
"The braids scare the voters. They'd rather have the Rocky Mountain Doughboy or Joel ""Z-Bo With Defense"" Embiid win.  (But also, Jokic and Embiid are bonkers and both deserve it so much this year)"
"My man, I used your own insult against you. Don’t come at me about name calling.   I have no idea what you’re so mad about. Joel Embiid did a nice thing. Writers who write about Embiid and the Sixers wrote about him doing a nice thing. And here you are doing ... what exactly?"
It's probably gonna be Joel Embiid since the Sixers will likely finish first in the East. Denver is unlikely to finish higher than fourth given Murray's injury and how far back they are from third (2.5 games).
"39 points.   It was on pretty bad efficiency but it was because no one on offense wanted to lift a finger to help Joel. But watching the game, Embiid was much better held down by double-teaming him with Claxton and Johnson. Those two hustled their asses off while DJ couldn’t get a hand up to contest a jumper."
"😹😹😹😹😹 how about we just tax people more so Joel doesn't have to donate to charity to feed and clothe and house homeless people!!!!!  Also it's funny the hate im getting on this, next time you donate $15 from your paycheck to a charity let's tell ESPN and I'm sure they'll write an article about you  It's not like I'm saying anything bad about Joel, I like Embiid, it's good that he donated money. I'm criticising the press for hopping on his dick when it's just a drop in the bucket. god we are fucking dense aren't we?  It's literally the equivalent of most people on this sub sending in a donation for $15 bucks and the press sucks his dick clean. That is what I am talking about"
I say run with it. You guys look great with that mid size combo guard archetype with Seth. And I think CJ is probably a better defender than Seth anyways. As long as you have Ben and Joel you’ll have a monstrous defense so get a guy that just gets buckets  Turning Seth/other assets into CJ McCollum (who can play make sometimes) is the perfect guy next to Ben and Embiid.
"I’ve watched a ton of them. Try making a coherent argument  Try reading the article you posted which says Joel Embiid is one of the most complete players, and frequently raves about Jokic and his ability to post up."
"I'll leave you with this ESPN article from this morning titled, *Joel Embiid has become one of the NBA's most COMPLETE superstars* (I don't have an Insider subscription but watch the video for a taste of Embiid's dominant skillset): https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31394301/joel-embiid-become-one-nba-most-complete-superstars"
"I hope not. I don't believe he should win it this season. He's only been playing great in the latter half of the season, and he does a lot of illegal moves that don't get called. It's Joel Embiid who deserves it this year."
If Joel Embiid was a baseball player he would play for the Dodgers
"Love this, I'll let you post it if you want when we get to the Sixers. Same goes for anyone who wants to post a lineup for their team.  Joel Embiid should hit third though"
Okay I'll give you that. I'd kill for Joel to be able to pass like Jokic when he gets doubled but are we looking at MVP as best overall player or best offensive player? I just think Embiid being an elite defender makes up some of the offensive gap. Point is moot cause Embiid missed too many games though.

A great playmaker with subpar shooting and bad defense can raise a floor really well but if you put him on a team with a couple of great playmakers already he doesn't help the team as much. he can come off the bench and contribute but not to the same extent.  It depends on the team that is looking for a ceiling raiser and what they lack. but every team could use an Anthony Davis/Joel Embiid.
Don't pretend there wasn't a lot of this right before they hired Doc: [https://thesixersense.com/2020/09/21/philadelphia-76ers-why-trade-joel-embiid/](https://thesixersense.com/2020/09/21/philadelphia-76ers-why-trade-joel-embiid/)
"Less than two months after his 27th birthday, Joel Embiid looks like one of the most important players in professional basketball. He's more confident than ever for one reason: He has become one of the most complete superstars in the game.  As Embiid enters his prime, he's the centerpiece on both ends of the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers, who have become a legitimate threat to win it all.  No center has won the MVP award since Shaquille O'Neal in 1999-2000 for the Los Angeles Lakers. That drought should end this year, with both Embiid and Nikola Jokic making strong cases and reminding us that big men still matter. Not only does Embiid rank third in the league in scoring this season, but he also anchors one of the best defenses in the league, a key claim that Jokic cannot make.  Entering Thursday, the Sixers have the best record in the East, and Embiid is the biggest reason for that. Consider this:   In the 1,457 minutes he's been on the court this season, Philadelphia has a monstrous net rating of plus-12.0.  In the 1,693 minutes he's been on the bench this season, Philadelphia has a net rating of minus-0.3.  Embiid has had a breakout season, and while his place in the MVP race might dominate podcast conversations, that's just a distraction -- the real story here is Embiid and the new-look 76ers appear to be evolving into one of the most sustainable contenders in the NBA.  The arrivals of Daryl Morey and Doc Rivers signified the beginning of a new era in Philadelphia. Together, they've overhauled the vibes around Embiid and Ben Simmons. Morey quickly traded Al Horford and added good shooters like Seth Curry and Danny Green, while Rivers refreshed the actions and the rotations.  The result has been a more cohesive, more spacey ecosystem, which has cleared out the clutter and enabled Embiid to do what he does best. He's scoring more than ever, and he's doing so at a more efficient clip than we've ever seen from him. He's on pace to set career highs in both 2-point shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. When you look at his shot chart from this season, you can see he's filling it up from all over the place.  Embiid is both more active and more efficient as a jump shooter than ever. He has both attempted and made more jumpers than anyone else on the Sixers. He's taking more than 15 jumpers per 100 possessions, up from 13.6 last season, and he's making more than 40% of them for the first time in his career.  Coming into this season, he'd struggled to achieve average 3-point shooting efficiency despite being gifted wide-open looks by defenses that dared him to shoot. But this season, Embiid has converted 36.8% of his 3.1 3-point tries per game.  That's a massive development because defenses now must honor his long-range game, which opens up other opportunities for him and his teammates elsewhere.  The bigger development has come inside the arc, where Embiid now shows off a feathery touch on midrange shots. He's attempting 11.4 non-paint 2s per 100, the highest such number among the 83 players who have tried at least 100 midrangers this season. Oh, and he's making them, too, converting 43.6% of his non-paint 2s this season. That's not only the highest such mark of his career by far, but it also changes the math on how teams must defend him away from the rim.  While his outside shooting has developed, it's his nightly performances on the low block that provide us all a reminder of the virtues of a style of play mostly left for dead in recent years. For decades, big post-up centers like Embiid dominated the NBA, but post play rapidly declined as the NBA fell in love with 3-point shots, motion offenses and faster-paced action. Post -ups happen more than 50% less frequently than they did just eight years ago.  Since the league added its player tracking system in 2013-14, post-up activity has cratered. That season, NBA teams posted up over 16.35 times per 100 possessions. This season, that figure is 8.17 times per 100.  But that staggering trend does not apply in Philly or in Denver, where the league's top two MVP candidates just happen to be dominating the league via old-school post play.  Get this: Embiid is posting up as an individual more per game than 27 other teams are collectively! Only the Lakers and Nuggets as teams are posting up more than he does.  Jokic isn't far behind, posting up more than 24 teams.  Just like the folks who have made us recently reconsider our stances on mom jeans, Embiid and Jokic are making post play cool again.  Embiid ranks first in the league, posting up 19.3 times per 100 possessions. Jokic ranks fourth, posting up 13.7 times per 100. And out of 19 players who have posted up at least 200 times this season, Jokic ranks first in efficiency, Embiid ranks second.  It's remarkable that the league's top two MVP candidates are both centers who are revising the conventional wisdom of the past 10 years: Centers were supposed to be endangered species; post play was supposed to be dying out.  Embiid is the only player in the league scoring double digits per game on post plays, and his MVP campaign is also a demonstration that the old Mikan-Russell-Chamberlain-Jabbar dance ain't dead just yet.  The pace-and-space era and the 3-point revolution have reformed the ways NBA front offices value the skills of frontcourt talent. The ability to thrive in the post on offense and defense used to be paramount. Now it isn't, and scouting reports for big men now examine their abilities to guard multiple positions, shoot from 25 feet, run the floor, grab rebounds, protect the rim, and serve up dribble-handoffs to the guards and wings they share the floor with.  As a result, the players attempting to stop the post actions of Embiid and Jokic might not be as common or as equipped to defend these actions in years past.  Just as post offense is a lost art, so is post defense. That is great news for Embiid, who is on the right side of his prime, one of the most imposing post players this league has seen in decades and still getting better. Embiid and Jokic would have thrived in any era, but in the context of the modern NBA, in which strength and size are less prioritized, there is a mouse in the house more than ever before.  As a defender himself, Embiid provides the Sixers with quite the opposite. As a 280-pound 7-footer with a 7-foot, 6-inch wingspan, he's among the league's biggest and best defenders.  The Sixers rank second in defensive efficiency in the NBA this season, giving up just 106.8 points per 100. While they decorate the defensive end with an imposing fleet of willing, savvy and sizable defenders, they play their best defense when both Simmons and Embiid are on the floor. Simmons is one of the world's most talented perimeter defenders. The combination of his point guard instincts, his defensive will and his own physical prowess make him a solid Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Meanwhile, Embiid is both an elite rim protector and rebounder.  The numbers are staggering.  Philadelphia is 32-6 in games in which Embiid and Simmons have played, a 69-win pace in a full 82-game season. In the 1,066 minutes in which they've shared the floor, Philadelphia's net rating is an absurd plus-16.2. That's the highest such mark among any two-man combo in the Eastern Conference (minimum 1,000 minutes played), and it has a lot to do with getting stops; with Embiid and Simmons on the floor, Philly's defensive rating is an eye-popping 102.2. If these guys can stay healthy, Philly's crunch-time lineups will be two-way nightmares for anyone.  At 27, it's impossible to watch Embiid and not think of former GM Sam Hinkie, and the early days of Embiid's pro career. It didn't look good. How many players miss two entire seasons of play before eventually turning into franchise players? Not many, but that's exactly how Embiid's arc began in Philly, which makes what he's doing right now even more impressive.  Along with Jokic, Embiid is making centers great again, but along with Simmons, he's also further validating the radical team-building process Hinkie designed eight years ago. No matter what happens from here on out, Embiid's eventual legacy will be tied to that polarizing tanking experiment.  No center has won the NBA MVP since Shaq did so in 1999-2000. That's about to change. Centers are relevant again, but that's not all. Basketball in Philadelphia is relevant, too. And even though Embiid might come up short on the MVP vote this season, it would be foolish to label this regular season anything short of a triumph. As a player, he has yet to reach his ceiling, but he has driven himself into the MVP conversation, and in the process, he has taken the 76ers from a punchline to the top of the Eastern Conference.  That was the plan all along."
Joel Embiid has literally never played a single minute at forward in his career lol
"[Kobes 2007-2008 shot chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kobe-mvp-shot-chart)  [Embiid’s current year shot chart](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=joel+embiid+shot+chart+2020-2021)  Kobe shot from way more locations and also created his own shot way more often than Embiid does. If versatility is your measurement than Kobe was able to create his own shot more often and from more locations on the court.  I’m not saying Embiid isn’t versatile, or isn’t having a great year. He is playing like an MVP. But if you are saying he is the most versatile offensive player ever, well there are players shooting better percentages this season on the court with a bigger shot distribution than Embiid."

Agreed. It will definitely be interesting to see if Joel “best player in the East” Embiid is healthy enough to bring us the championship.
This Joel Embiid fella is pretty good at basketball eh?
"Shaq: “Here‘a my top NBA players... #1, my man, LeBron James. Wish I helped him win in Cleveland, but he’s helping my Lakers win big. #2, my man, Anthony Davis. Big fella, feasting on BBQ chicken like yours truly. #3... Giannis... what can I say? Big fella like yours truly... #4... here’s what I’m gonna say, Joel Embiid has gotta step it up if he wants to win a championship... rings, Erneh... and the fact is when guys like KD and Giannis are in the East, you gotta fight harder and play in the paint... what team is Kevin Love on again? Anyways, that’s my list, I think my man, Anthony Davis could go back-to-back this year, unlike you, Chuck... who never even had one back, much less than two!... Dame’s pretty good, also... not as good as me, though.”"

"I like the way you think. But Joel Embiid is on another level, and no one is taking FMVP from him if we win the finals."
"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."

I chuckled when they flashed the East’s big 3’s and for Philly it was: Joel Embiid - Ben “I scored 5 points last game” Simmons and... I think Tobias Harris? Sure will go with that.   Good luck in the post season!
"As someone who loves Embiid, no. Simmons is the best defender on the team. I think Joel has more upside as a defender based on his size/ability/position, and when he really tries he can be the best defender on the floor. But Simmons gives a more consistent effort defensively night-in and night-out. Which makes sense, because the team relies a lot on Embiid for offense.  Also Thybulle's closeouts are amazing."

"Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle"
"If you get your height from your legs + are skinny you just look taller. Not to mention a 7'5 wingspan. Kd is barely taller than lebron in pics of them together.  Also, Embiid got posted at 7', seems to tower over kd in any pic they are in together.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2733943-joel-embiid-says-hes-better-than-mj-in-kevin-durant-burnertwitter-joke  And in this pic kd is wearing sneakers and Embiid loafers lmao. So the barefoot gap would be even bigger."
"I think the Bucks are in the Suns/Jazz/Sixers tier, but the thing I like about them is that they’re clearly extremely self-aware and introspective about their past playoff issues and have been very deliberately using the whole offseason+regular season as a lab for working on fixing those problems. That’s a natural response to them having such high expectations the previous two seasons and then getting a ton of scrutiny when they didn’t meet them. The reason I’m skeptical of the Sixers is that I think they have really similar issues (no coincidence- as both of them have non-shooting primary ballhandlers that really struggle in the slower paced, more deliberate playoff halfcourt offenses), but the Sixers are much less often criticized for their playoff performance, because they got swept without Simmons last year and in 2019 they lost to the eventual champs on a buzzer beater, even though the best Sixers player on that team was Jimmy and Embiid struggled mightily on offense (17.6/8.7/3 with 28TOs and 37/34/84 shooting splits). But, the expectations weren’t there, and it seems like they aren’t really self-aware about it- it really comes off like they think they’ll just be able to “dominate” in the playoffs without doing much to fix their flaws. Namely, how to prevent offensive stagnation when reliant on post scoring from a player who still really struggles with doubles- Sixers have a 97.7 ORTG when Joel is hard doubled in the post, and how to prevent the offense from turning into a functional 4v5 when Ben doesn’t have the ball, which makes it really easy for teams to double Embiid. They also have an insane amount of defensive talent, great shooters, and a lot of talent that *might* just be able to overwhelm a porous East, but I’m just not really sold, and wouldn’t be surprised at all if Ben and Embiid get thrown way out of rhythm when they realize they can’t just run thru teams when they’re gameplanned against.    Nets are hard to rate- they should be in the top tier but I just can’t shake the feeling that they’re not going to have it all together, and at this point it’s no guarantee they’ll magically all be healthy in the playoffs when they haven’t been all season. After seeing how the clippers collapsed last year, largely because of insufficient chemistry and rust, I wouldn’t be surprised if the Nets run into trouble too. Again though, the East is pretty weak and all 3 top teams have major flaws, so they might be fine."
"&gt;Different coach  The only coach in NBA history who's blown three 3-1 series leads.  &gt;a different Joel Embiid  But is he different enough? Defenses can be more physical in the playoffs, and Embiid's preferred drop-coverage defensive scheme is less effective. It's still fair to wonder whether he is in good enough shape to impact both ends while logging big minutes.   &gt;I hope we get the chance  Agreed!"

Legit “Joel” Embiid
"[League data shows the player injury rate this season is down about 6%, even though several marquee players — including LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, James Harden and most recently Jamal Murray — have dealt with injuries in recent weeks.](https://www.nba.com/news/nba-says-injury-rate-down-slightly-from-normal)"

"Thybulle is great but gets bench minutes. Embiid rarely plays alongside him. I'm not going to deny Ben's perimeter defense, but there's a reason why the defense has always been great with Embiid, even before Simmons turned into the wing defender he is now.   Capela maybe, but he doesn't have the mobility of Joel. Myles, just like Clint, can chase blocks, but they don't quite deter shots like Embiid. Turner too especially is BBQ chicken in the post, even if that's an afterthought in most matchups."
"On the other hand, Joel Embiid. Even so, Ben Simmons."
Joel Embiid in utter shambles
Jaylen Brown is averaging 33 ppg when Tatum is not playing this season. Using career highs is stupid as shit. I guess Tatum is a much better offensive force than Joel Embiid and Kevin Durant because his career high is more than both. Saying that Jaylen is subpar on defense is legitimately stupid. He’s one of the best on-ball defenders in the league and takes the toughest matchup each night. His off-ball D is slightly above average.
"https://www.nba.com/news/nba-tells-teams-rules-will-be-relaxed-for-vaccinated-persons  The contact tracing part of the new rules will be a major benefit. Being flagged by contact tracing has been an issue for many players this season including Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, both of whom had to miss the All-Star Game and the start of the season’s second half because a barber that they visited tested positive — but they did not. Had they been fully vaccinated, they would not have had to miss any time even after being around someone who tested positive for COVID-19."
"Obviously not. But the mentality at the time was that Okafor was Embiid insurance, considering Joel had still yet to touch an NBA floor. Looking at the 2015 draft, it's a lot of role players, and then Booker at 13. Porzingis was picked after Okafor, but looking at the situation now, is he really better fit with Embiid and Simmons then Harris is?"
"He’s not in contention for best C, he’s pretty clearly the best center right now. AD is a PF and he’s going to finish above Embiid in all-NBA voting for the 3rd straight season, is in a completely different tier than him in the playoffs, and Joel is shooting 31% (9/29) against him in his career so doesn’t even match up well.   Boogie did well but Jokic is really good at baiting off-ball fouls and I think it’s hard to picture that going away."
"No he doesn’t lol. The only thing Wood has on Capela is scoring and unless you’re Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, or Nikola Jokic, teams are far better off with strong defensive bigs."
Same dude thinks Joel Embiid isn’t a stretch 5 either. This list is pretty much BS.
Steph definitely on the court. I'm gonna say Joel Embiid and Giannis for their personalities during interviews and being able to have fun on and off the court. We really need that in this world especially during these shitty times.
Andrew Wiggins is shooting 38% from 3 this year. Julius Randle is shooting 42%. Joel Embiid is shooting 37%. Stop it.
How the hell are you going to miss Joel embiid with that flair?
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
Joel Embiid (ROFL) listed out for Sunday.
"I'm sorry man but that's just not what opinions and facts are. Facts can be proven, opinions can't, they can only be supported with facts. I can say Jokic is better than Mike Scott and that's not a fact it can't be. It's an opinion I support with facts like the difference between their ppg, apg, mpg, etc. The Earth being flat isn't an opinion. It's a lie. The Earth is round and that can be proven with science and video.   For instance you're saying that him saying Embiid is the MVP is him saying Embiid is a lot better than Jokic. That's your interpretation of his opinion. That is basically your opinion of his opinion. But I'm not sure he would say that even though that's the conclusion you came to. I don't think Tim Legler, Shaq, RJ, Windy, Rachel Nichols, etc. all think Joel has been *much* better than Jokic yet they all think Joel is the MVP. They all have their different reasons for believing what they believe.  For most voters it comes down to how much does Embiid's missed time hurt him. Most actual voters have made it clear it basically DQs him from the award. That's how they chose to vote. But if someone went the other way I don't think it's automatically a slight to Jokic. They both have had MVP calibur seasons."

"how? this will be Jokic vs Embiid in a close MVP voting imo.  And just because Lebron was put down missing more than 20 games, because at some point it was Embiid, Lebron and Jokic.  I think Joker will win, but it will be close to Joel."
"This 100%. Joel is my favorite player but jokic deserves it straight up. If Joel didn't miss any games, it's a way easier conversation to convince someone embiid but not now at all. Mvp is a lock now"
"Simply put, embiid in an equal offensive player who dominates his matchups every night while being a top 5 defender. Joel would beat jokic 10 out of 10 times 1v1. Jokic is a great passer who is a BAD rim protecter at the center position."
Wasnt Joel embiid +100 against the raptors?
"https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/10/9/16450238/joel-embiid-76ers-max-contract-extension-injury-history  Just look at the comments on this lol, cold takes all over"
"The Nuggets have been between 16th and 10th in DRTG the past 3 seasons (12th this year) which is fine. And they’ve been fine in the playoffs- you can’t really look at overall playoff team stats in a vacuum like that because there is a ton of noise, and teams only play against a few different teams- I mean Simmons has only played against 4 teams in the playoffs, that’s not gonna tell you a lot of you’re just looking at the raw team numbers.    Let’s look at how the Sixers have faired in the playoffs with this pairing:  2018: slapped around in the second round, gentleman’s sweep  2019: carried offensively by Jimmy Butler (no longer on team), Embiid was absolute dog water on offense vs Toronto, and Simmons had the lowest USG% of the starting lineup, with Butler averaging more assists AND fewer turnovers than him. Sixers lose in the 2nd round again.  2020: Non-competitive sweep, Ben doesn’t play, Joel is mediocre at best despite averaging 30ppg.    That’s not a lot to show.... and again, he was the 5th option in 2019, and you no longer have Jimmy. If you want to win a title with those guys as your two stars he needs to be able to do more than hide as a 5th option, we’ll see if it works this year. But his non-spacing ability is almost certainly part of why Embiid has been so awful on offense in the playoffs thus far.   The nuggets held the Clippers to less than 100ppg average over the last 4 games of that series last season, arguably as good a team as the Sixers have ever faced in the playoffs. And the Sixers play in a far less competitive conference."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"Wilt was one step below a Greek god. He was like one of those Greek mythological heroes that was born from a mortal woman that Zeus banged. It’s impossible to really convey how good he was.   He was one of the first professional athletes with a modern training program and it really showed. He was the fastest player in the NBA in his era, probably the strongest in NBA history. If he had access to a state of the art training center, dietitians, played AAU during summers, and had the modern level of skill development, you’re looking at a guy who would make Joel Embiid look like Jerome James.   It’s unfortunate that his prime was during the run of the greatest dynasty the NBA has ever seen, because he easily wins 4-5 more championships without those Celtics teams in the way. His 76ers team and Bob Petitt’s Hawks were the only two to beat those teams in the playoffs."
"In Game 7, Joel Embiid played 45:12 and had a +/- of +10. Greg Monroe played 1:41 and was -9."
"Ok so I wasn't clear. I should have said ""decide to shoot"" not ""decide to be a shooter."" He absolutely cannot decide to just be a good shooter, that's the stupid shit that most of the haters think. That hard work, prayers and vitamins automatically make someone good at something.   Secondly, he does not destroy spacing. Watch a Sixers game when Ben is on the court with Embiid. Or just look at some YT videos or Athletic articles. Ben provides value this season off ball or we wouldn't be winning. Joel certainly wouldn't be scoring almost 30 a night.   Lastly yeah I 100% disagree about your rim protection comment. Yeah you can help Jokic with a shot blocking four but ultimately it's up to the center to protect the rim. When Davis doesn't want to protect the rim and be a center (which is most times) they don't bring a PF in for him, the bring a center in and make him a PF and he's great at help defense, but he's still not the one that protects the rim."
Joel embiid
there is no argument in which he is more important than top 2 MVP candidate joel Embiid
"He is not a scorer and certainly not a shooter. He's in his fourth year and going to his third playoffs. And yes he was the fifth scoring option on that team that played Toronto. Asking him to be a scorer is like asking why Mitchell can't make passes like Ben. I'm sure they both work on the things they aren't good at.   Also look man, we can agree to disagree but please don't try and tell me that by and large this sub doesn't straight up hate Ben Simmons. They talk about this dude more than ANY OTHER NON SUPERSTAR IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE. Every fucking day there's a myriad of Ben Simmons posts.   There are so many young players that are terrible on defense and terrible playmakers or rebounders but because he's a terrible shooter he gets so much criticism. He could score 20+ ppg on worse efficiency if he was the top or second option. But he's not. Joel is followed by Harris. Then the next best option is usually the guy receiving the Ben Simmons pass. That's what he was saying his role isn't to be a volume scorer. Some players need to do that even at worse efficiency because their team needs it. The Sixers don't need Ben taking mid range shots while Embiid is on the court. They simply don't.   And his mindset is fine and please don't get me started on the Sixers ""playoff reputation."" People crown and kill players in the playoffs way too quickly. Dude has been in the playoffs as a rookie and a sophomore he got bounced in the second round of both. That's not terrible at all, and he's not holding shit back, he's helping us reach our ceiling. People act like he and Jo should have won a title by now *he has gone to the playoffs twice* he's not playoff anything. Neither are some of these dudes people like to slurp because they went off for a couple of series in the bubble. Unless a dude has been in the league for way more time than these young guys please don't tell me about how they perform well or poorly in the playoffs."
"One of the main reasons I love basketball is because of the diversity in body types of players. Like, Steph is at least as good as Joel Embiid, even though if you saw Joel Embiid in your daily life, it would be like looking at a demigod. If you take that away, what's the point?"
&gt; How did Joel Embiid emerge out of all the craziness into an mvp caliber player in this environment?  Because he embraces and enjoys chaos. It's the perfect environment for him.
"He's a point guard, shouldn't he focus on running the offense rather than just scoring as much as possible?   Embiid said  “He’s got to be aggressive,” and “He’s got to make guys on the other team guard him""  I agree with that but that's not just scoring. You can be aggressive and just force the defense to respect you.   “I want him to be aggressive, but I think you think of aggressiveness as him aggressively scoring,” Sixers head coach Doc Rivers said. “I think him aggressive with him getting into the paint, creating plays. He can have an aggressive game for me where he doesn’t shoot a lot, but he was aggressive and he used his speed. That’s what we want.” -[Source](https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/joel-embiid-ben-simmons-relationship-sixers-playoff-chances-20210411.html) for quotes"
"BREAKING NEWS:  Windhurts reports that the Kicks are trying to lure Lebraawwn James, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, and Zion Willionson to try and and form the greatest  posse of all time!!  Unfortunately they already have one of the worst owners in all of sports.  Brought to you by a salty Nuggets fan."
"Everyone has a role to play and I'm playing mine is not the same as him saying he's a role player and I feel like you know that. Joel Embiid says he has a role to play on this team, on offense and defense. So is he saying he's just a role player too?   I would keep going but again I know you and most people on here know what Ben is saying and are being intentionally disingenuous."
"Kawhi&gt;Jimmy ofc, but Embiid was the best player for Philly in that series. Peep the on/off. Jimmy was good, no doubt, but the team bled points whenever Joel sat."
"How did the Sixers end up drafting all the crazy people? First they get Fultz, who forgot how to play basketball and thought he was a turkey, and then they have Simmons who clearly has some type of three point phobia that has spread into a general scoring phobia.   How did Joel Embiid emerge out of all the craziness into an mvp caliber player in this environment?"
"clarkson  3.1 WS  0.8 BPM 1.0 VORP  41.8FG% 54.4% TS (league average is 57.1) ​17/4/2  , terrible defender and black hole on offense while shooting way below league average  ingles 6.2 WS  4.2 bpm, 2.4 VORP 50.8% fg, 70.0% TS (#1 in NBA) 12/4/4 ,  above average defender and best shooter in the NBA by %   so by just about all metrics, ingles is not just a little better, but they should not be discussed in the same sentence, as it is the equivalent of calling Kwame Brown better than Joel Embiid"
"&gt;	This is such a weird take. Embiid and Thybulle are both top 10 defenders in the league so you choosing them over Simmons is hardly an insult.   Is it weird because it doesn’t fit your narrative? Or you simply don’t like it? Either way, simmons is not too 10 by any impact metric *that is correlated to defensive impact*.   &gt;	Thybulle doesn’t play enough and Simmons is better than Joel  Thybulle does what Ben does on the perimeter but better in limited minutes. And embiid protects the interior which ben does **not**. Only ESPN clowns would think a switchable guard has more defensive impact than a rim protecting center in his physical prime."
This is such a weird take. Embiid and Thybulle are both top 10 defenders in the league so you choosing them over Simmons is hardly an insult. And you’re just doing it to exaggerate your point. Thybulle doesn’t play enough and Simmons is better than Joel
"Embiid should be throwing every shot attempt in the paint the fuck out of play. Dikembe Mutombo looks more motivated for Geico commercials than Joel does on D sometimes tbh. Not judging as he carries the team single handedly scoring and is the MVP imo, but for his size he should consistently assert a tad more dominance in the paint on D."
Surely. Most likely will read as “Joel Embiid is MVP!”
Or the stats are just wrong. You think Chris Paul is doubled more than Joel Embiid?

"This is your daily reminder that the Sixers have a losing record in games without Embiid this season.   As of today I'd probably still give Jokic the MVP, but let's not pretend the Sixers would be anywhere near 1st place if not for Joel Embiid."
"Fun fact, [Embiid has the highest PP36 of any player with at least 5000 minutes played](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-pts-per-36-minutes-by-a-nba-player-over-a-career-with-5000-pts)  That’s all time btw, not just active players. He has a higher PP36 than MJ lol  Though if you drop the requirement to 2500 minutes Zion inches out Joel"
"I knew, and anyone paying attention knew Joel Embiid would be a perennial all star from his first game.  Yes he was injured but different story than Wiseman.  I can’t tell you one defining skill that Wiseman has that elevates him from the Jarrett Allen’s of the league."
"&gt; Oh, wow. There’s an argument to be made that arguably the greatest basketball player ever, might be better than another all time great?! I’m shocked. Kareem also had one of the most indefensible shots in NBA History.  OP mentioned legacy's. I stand by what I said and I don't think Hakeem stacks up to Kareem when many people rate Hakeem higher.  &gt;Talking shit about Olajuwon’s offensive game without having ever seen him play is hilarious.  How many full games did you watch of the 80's or 90's rockets?   &gt;And you’re completely ignoring the fact that he is one of the greatest defenders ever.  I said his offense is overrated. I think this years Joel Embiid or Jokic is better offense than any year of Hakeem.   &gt;Your methodology for picking an “Overrated” player was, who didn’t score that much or on insane efficiency that is super highly rated?  My metholdology was recognizing that many people rate Hakeem over Kareem and telling people why I disagree and why the numbers don't stack up but I will admit I didn't watch the entire resume of guys from 3 decades ago."

"Suns &gt; Sixers. They might be inexperienced but they have a much higher BBIQ leader in CP3 and a game that translates way better to the playoffs because neither of their primary scorers is hyper-vulnerable to doubles and they’re good at scoring at all 3 levels, especially tough midrange shots that are really common in the playoffs. The Sixers still have some unresolved playoff questions with the Simmons-Joel core, especially Joel’s vulnerability to doubles (Philly has a 97.7 ORTG when he’s hard doubled in the post this year which is really bad, esp with how reliant their offense is on his post scoring), and how they keep the offense from becoming a 4v5 when Ben doesn’t have the ball, which just makes it that much easier for teams to double Embiid. Probably at least one of Tobias/Green is gonna have to be hot for them, and both of those guys are risky streaky."
"Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell, Matisse Thybulle, Dario Saric, Joel Embiid"
"As a nuggets fan, if Joel Embiid played the full season it would be a very, very tough decision for MVP. Big respect to the 76er. He's amazing to watch."
"In the 2019 ECSF between the Sixers and the Raptors, through 7 games Joel Embiid averaged 17.6 ppg on 37% FG.   In comparison, throughout the regular season Joel Embiid averaged 27.5 ppg on 48% shooting.  Looks to me he was stopped."
How was working out with Joel Embiid?????
"Wiseman is 4 games removed at the beginning of the season from playing HS basketball and here I thought he would best the likes of Anthony Davis, Clint Capela, and Joel Embiid.  Silly me."
"Why are you using seeding when he has the same record as Joel Embiid while in a much tougher conference, with a worse supporting cast? 26/11/8 on better efficiency than Joel while playing more games, the MVP Case is shut. Embiid has no chance."
"A one dimensional game is a problem for normal players, but when someone is scoring at all-time rates at all-time efficiency, this doesn't apply to them. Shaq absolutely dominated in playoffs down low, and he didn't start winning finals until relatively later in his career. I don't care how much the game has changed since then, if Shaq played today he would still dominate just as much.  Another thing to think about is what would actually happen if Zion started taking more 3's. What would be a reasonable goal? Right now Zion shoots 3's 0.5 times per game at a rate of 30%. Giannis shoots 3.6 attempts per game and shoots at 30% this season. If you watch Bucks games you'll see that these are basically never contested. Would this change if Zion could shoot a few threes per game at above league average rate? We already have an example of a dominant paint player who does this right now, Joel Embiid. He shoots 3.1 attempts per game at 37.5%. That's pretty good! But does this change how defenses guard him? Not at all, he only is contested on 20% of his 3's. Defenses would much rather let him do this than destroy them in the paint. We have no reason to believe this would be any different for Zion. You really have to consider how elite Zion is at scoring the way he is doing it already.  Again it obviously wouldn't hurt Zion to develop a 3 point shot, but his time would be much better spent on improving as a playmaker and as a defender."
"So is Embiid. Not being able to stop Joel isn’t a Nets problem, no one can stop the dude lol."
Steph Curry   Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic
"I get the logic, but I think the only reason it works is because the Wolves are bad. I feel really strongly that if KAT had a better team around him, more people would realize how valuable a guy like him is on offense. First of all, KAT doesn't primarily shoot 3s. 2019 was the only year in his career where he has attempted more than 5 threes a game. His scoring breakdown is like 4-5ppg from free throws, 12-14ppg from less than 10 feet, and then the rest (5-7ppg) from jump shots.  Now, you could still definitely counter with the point that KAT still spends a lot of his time on the perimeter, because a lot of his scoring in the paint comes from drives. But I still don't buy the argument that its a bad thing.  1. Foul drawing. KAT is still top 20 every year in FTA  2. Pretty much everyone has recognized now that post scoring is one of the least efficient ways to score. Guys like Vernon Carey from Duke drop to the second round of the draft even though he was dominant as an 18 year old, because he does most of his scoring in the post (and wasn't a great defender). It's just not as valuable as having a guy that can shoot the 3. Joel Embiid is the exception to the rule. He is perhaps the most dominant post scorer of the last 10 years and so he gets the big green light. But the jury is still somewhat out on how much value his post scoring actually provides because he has had way more talent around him than KAT and the 76ers still haven't really done anything. Now it's not his fault that his playstyle clashes with Ben Simmons a little bit, and they would probably be better on offense with more of a shooter like Mitchell or Booker, etc. but I also think its likely that Ben Simmons looks way better next to KAT's spacing.  3. Your and Chuck's argument just completely ignore the effect that a shooting big has on the defense. It pulls the opponent's rim protector away from the rim and makes it so much easier to drive to the rim, move off ball, etc.  4. I will give you that it does mean you are getting fewer offensive rebounds, but I will trade that any day for opening up the paint more. There are a lot of coaches these days that tell players not to hunt for offensive rebounds anyway because if you don't get it the opposing team has the advantage. KAT at the 3p line means he can be one of the first back and slow down fast breaks."
"Yes it does. In the league now that version of Steph gets a max, and nobody bats an eye. Joel Embiid played 94 games in his first 4 years and the 76ers happily backed up the brinks truck to his house."
Joel Embiid for MVP.
"I'm not sure when that pic is from or if there's something going on with depth perception, but here's him standing next to LeBron and is [clearly taller.](https://www.libertyballers.com/2016/8/31/12734146/ben-simmons-workout-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-offseason-nba-draft) here's him next to [embiid as well who is legit 7ft without shoes.](https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2017/10/12/16459648/nba-playoff-contenders-philadelphia-poised-to-finally-compete-joel-embiid-ben-simmons)"
"I'm not disparaging anyone lmao. It's a fact that the Sixers are 10 times less the team without Joel Embiid. It's the same as the Warriors missing Curry or the Nuggets missing Jokic. It's still a win, yes, but no one cares that your team beat the Warriors without Curry. lol"
You're not a fan of Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons?
"No Joel Embiid, literally the MVP frontrunner."
"Gee, I don’t know how long you’ve used the internet, but uh, there’s this thing called ‘trolling’. It’s where you try to bait people into having a negative response by saying or doing something controversial. Joel ‘Troel’ Embiid is well known for trolling people. I would also like to point out that what you linked me was clearly Twitter."
"Players who are top 20 in both qualified PPG and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Zach LaVine. That’s it."
"&gt; he wanted was for players not to get mocked and / or black-balled because they want a trade out of somewhere  &gt;  he just wants a bit more consideration for players who demand trades  Nah, they can get fucked IMO. Disloyal doubchebags who don't respect their words and their signatures should definitely be blackballed and mocked.   &gt; have the same energy when teams sit players in preparation to trade players  I will have the same energy is a team refuses to pay a player while sitting him out. Until then, nah, he doesn't have a point.  &gt; It really isn’t that much to ask for.  He's essentially asking for people to look after the interests of players and not the interests of the teams? Why? I'm a fan of the Philadelphia 76ers, not of Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons.   He's literally asking us to go against our own interests, and the imbeciles above are cheering him on, lmao."
"LeBron will not win MVP.   Not only does the team need to reach the top seed the majority of the time to win MVP, in the past 5 seasons the MVP was #1 in PER. Also the last 10 MVP out of the past 12 seasons, the MVP was #1 in PER (only Curry #3 in '15, and Rose #9 in 2011), however, Curry and Rose's team led the entire NBA in wins that year.    Lebron James is currently #17 in PER being 7 full points behind #1 Joel Embiid. Joel Embiid and Lebron James have the same odds of winning MVP based on Vegas bookmakers at +1000. Embiid is a far better pick than Lebron.   The last time a person won with a PER ranking worse than the top 10, was Steve Nash both in 2005 and 2006 (PER 17 and PER 14)."
We’ll have Joel Embiid back. So there will be a much lesser need for Ben Abdul jabbar. Most of his points are always gonna come with layups and free throws anyway.  It he does shoot the mini sky hook at a good percentage whether you wanna laugh at me or not. He just doesn’t shoot them often. Tonight they hit in the first three. Didn’t in the last. But we needed him to stay aggressive so we’ll take it.
"He was absolutely dominant on that high P&amp;R tonight, if you played him in the Draymond Green role and surrounded him with shooters he would be brilliant. Big guys can't keep up with him, smalls get bullied in the post.  Somewhat ironically if you surrounded Joel Embiid with shooters he'd be brilliant too."
"You have had our number though for the past couple seasons. As much as I like Conley, missing Embiid tips the scales heavily towards us. Joel is such a nightmare match up, and I’m hoping we get to see both teams healthy on the 3rd."
&gt;a whiny little bitch for such a big dude  Joel Embiid is 7 feet tall
"Ben Simmons very good  Tobias Harris also pretty good  Joel Embiid injured  Rest of Sixers not good   Sixers lose  In all seriousness, whenever Ben or Tobi didn’t have the ball I was in pain, meanwhile Jazz are really good man and Conley is out rn, hopefully both teams are full strength for round 2"
Joel Embiid missed. Jordan Clarkson wet.
Mike”not anywhere close to Joel Embiid”Conley
Maybe because there’s a difference between mike Conley and Joel embiid. Conley’s more comparable to us missing shake Milton
"Myles never thrives against Embiid, but, specially this year, stopping Joel is almost impossible."
Is Joel Embiid...Joel Embad?
That’s why he purposely sat out games against Jokic and now Gobert after multiple games of playing in between?  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/why-ben-simmons-joel-embiid-miss-sixers-vs-nuggets
Joel Embiid? More like Joel No-need. Sixers are doing great anyway.
"he **literally** dodged the nuggets game a month ago with ""back soreness""  https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/76ers-joel-embiid-out-due-to-back-tightness/  delusional"
And sadly this is why Embiid is not the leader in the MVP race. He is so dominant but availability is also a part of a players value. Award would be cool and all but I just hope we have a healthy Joel Embiid for the playoffs
"lmao this is the same excuse he used to dodge jokic  https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/76ers-joel-embiid-out-due-to-back-tightness/  and before you sixers flairs start lying about him being out for ""covid protocols"" (LMAO)  &gt; Superstars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have both been listed as out for Saturday afternoon's contest with the Denver Nuggets as the teams get set to take the floor. Their reasoning for being out has nothing to do with COVID. “Yeah, but it has nothing to do with it, they're just not playing,” said coach Doc Rivers."
Is Embiid out? (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/nba/76ers/.amp/news/sixers-doc-rivers-joel-embiid-play-jazz)[this was posted] just an hour ago.
"So excited for this game.     In 5 career games against Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid has averaged just 20.5 PPG on 40% shooting from the field. He's also fouled at an average of 5 times per game with 2.8 of those fouls by Embiid on Gobert.      However Joel is having a career year offensively and Gobert a career year defensively so we could see something different. Either way it should be a red hot contest."
Dude played as a small ball center for two years straight.  Every other night it was Anthony Davis or Nikola Jokic or Joel Embiid.
"Context matters here. He’s playing like he’s Joel Embiid. He’s more like Deandre Jordan. Except instead of having Chris Paul he’s had Reggie Jackson and Sexton who have objectively been two of the worst passing starting PGs in recent history. At the peak in Detroit he shot 65% around the rim. I think if he’s paired with a good passing PG and sticks to screening/cutting/crashing the glass he’ll be a way more efficient ~15 PPG scorer than what he is now. He can’t finish post ups, layups, ISO’s (anything that requires touch) but he’s a fantastic lob finished when he just needs to dunk and not finish off the dribble. I think he’d be a great pairing for a PG like Lamelo who would flourish as a lob passer with an athletic freak at the 5.   The Cavs started the season pretty well when Drummond was engaged. He’s been a centerpiece of (crappy) playoff teams. He’s just an average center getting paid as an all nba one, but average would be an upgrade for a few teams."

"I was planning on doing an entire player profile because I was thinking about making the video about whether or not the Raptors should trade for him, but I figured it'd take too long and that the trade would be coming sooner rather than later.   I only did a cursory analysis of his defence before dropping the idea, but the one thing that stuck out to me was that he is far too lumbering and slow to be effective on the perimeter. He gets blown by so easily by guards and even some bigger wings. He can't switch, either.   His best defensive asset is his rim protection. He's been terrible this season in that department but I don't think it's fair to focus only on that. Historically, he hasn't been as good as he theoretically should be. Elite rim protectors like Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid not only force misses when players actually get to the rim, but they also deter players from attacking the rim altogether. Over the last few seasons those guys have cut down opponent shots at the rim bv 5 or 6% and saw a corresponding increase in opponent floaters and mid-range shots. Drummond doesn't seem to have nearly the same deterrent effect."
He thinks he is Joel Embiid
"Aw, that's cute. Bragging about being top of the conference after 25 games.  Who swept your ass last year? Your beloved Joel Embiid is 1-8 in the playoffs against us."
"That's literally my point lol. Wilt was drastically more athletic than his competition in that era. Much more akin to sticking a modern day freak athlete against college competition than today's NBA. Most NBA players during Wilt's era couldn't even dunk and many players had off-season jobs. Guys smoked in the locker rooms during halftime. This was a whole different time. Wilt's statistics were very impressive but they have to be taken with several grains of salt. If you took modern day Joel Embiid or Anthony Davis, made everyone an inch shorter and 25 pounds lighter, made it so most players couldn't dunk and were slower, then bumped the skill level down to college tier, THEN added an extra 60 possessions per game, and played him 48 minutes, they could average 50 ppg too. Context is everything."
"It really depends who you actually count as “center” I’m guessing AD isn’t one for this comparison. Embiid, Joel, Gobert, KP, KAT, Bam, Drummond, Vucevic, then it gets murky."
Sixers look the best out of all the east teams but I cant see them winning it. They need a perimeter scorer that can just get a bucket they still struggle on the road and have struggled to best good teams also think they are too dependent on Joel embiid
Joel Embiid is very close to satisfying him.
"I strongly believe that the foul cap needs to be either modified or eliminated entirely.  There's no need to kick people out at 6 fouls. It's not an effective way of preventing dirty play, and it unfairly handicaps guys who have physical two-way games, especially in the playoffs.   If a player is putting other guys at risk, give him flagrants and kick him out. If he's not, just let the other team keep shooting FT's all day long. It's really dumb that Joel Embiid can get kicked out at 6 fouls after playing 40+ minutes, while the opposing team that has 3 bigs rack up 4 fouls each doesn't get punished."
So basically all the stat guys on this subreddit think that Rudy Gobert and Joel Embiid should be the only two guys in the DPOY voting because ORTG overvalues rim-protecting centers. Got it.

"Players in top 20 in scoring and TS%:  Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Paul George, Zach LaVine.  that’s it. Insane how disrespected he is"
Joel embiid has Andre drummonds number
"We already do. Maybe not positionally, but whenever Portis is on the court with Giannis, Giannis becomes the primary rim protector and hangs around the painted area. I would love one year to play Giannis at the 5, but right now on his athletic prime, his help defense is what’s most impactful and Brook allows (allowed) us to do that, it’s just underutilizing Giannis to make him play the Joel Embiid role when he can be a mix between a great rim protector and a Lebron lite flying around the court contesting shots"

Joel “Patrick Ewing” Embiid
"That's Joel ""Do two 180s"" Embiid to you."
"I think it's foolish to say strength has nothing to do with those mechanics. It's basic physics, the taller, longer, and stronger you are the more potential energy you have available. You've got valid points, there's definitely more focus on shooting today, even though centers are still the worst free throw shooters by %, there's exceptions like Joel Embiid who shoots at about an 80% clip. But I'm saying a reason for lebron's ""inconsistent form"" is the fucking power that man has. https://youtu.be/xWT0EWiVQPE  I mean, just look at this shit, try to palm a basketball and throw it this distance, you can't and nobody you know can. I'd bet there's only about a dozen current nba players who could.  It's not the only reason for sure, mentality and nerves play into it, pressure, etc. But it's a part of the pie and to say that a player's strength has nothing to do with their ability to shoot the ball at a standstill isn't valid"
"Also look at the top three from last year, you mean to tell me Joel Embiid is the most efficient player in the league? The big that shoots too many threes ?🤣"
"Yup and skilled too. Like Embiid can't shoot in the mid-range like Durant, but when his defender is a center afraid to go near him and Joel gets to basically check the wind before he takes an easy mid-range jumper, then he kind of shoots in the mid-range like Durant lol."
"He'd be just as good. Shaq was basically 7'1 Zion. He was a much more complete player than people realize in terms of passing and playing defense. Obviously he couldn't shoot free throws but with his style of play it barely mattered. Joel is kind've touching peak Shaq scoring around the rim and posting up but the league is different. I think he'd be even better today.  So in 2001, the league is was just way bigger. Every team carried 3 legitimate hulkish centers and 3 legitimate bruising power forwards who almost all would be playing center today. Even small forwards back then would be playing some center today. So in 2001 Shaq shot an absurd 79% at the rim inside 3 feet. He was just unstoppable that year and it wasn't fair. Hack a Shaq was never about fouling Shaq on shots because it didn't matter he was dunking on you, his touch around the basket was elite and he was strong enough to absorb any and all contact and make his shots. He was also an elite passing bigmen something he doesn't get credit for, the only center that surpassed him in the league in that regard was Divac. Hack a Shaq was about fouling him before he shot the ball not even giving him a chance to back you down and dunk on him, you couldn't hack shaq on his shots he was just a force of nature.   So Embiid is much more skilled than Shaq, I think Embiid is going to be in the best big ever convo by the time it's all said and done. But Embiid for as good as he is has had trouble against Gasols smarts, strength, and quick feet. Gasol is literally the only center in basketball strong enough and good enough to compete with Joel. I don't think Shaq would have any problem man handling Gasol forreal. You couldn't run Shaq off the floor in 2001 either, he was fucking fast.   I had the bitter sweet pleasure of being at game 5 in 2001 when the Lakers won the chip. Like I'll never forget Matt Geiger coming in soley to foul the shit out of Shaq and basically trying to instigate a fight. He fouled out in 10 mins. We sent shaq to to the line 19 times, he went 9/19 and still scored 29 pts. Lol he was absurd. I remember he swatted a Tyrone Hill shot into like the 10th row half court."
"Has to be Id guess right?  PG - Joker  SG - AD  SF - Giannis  PF - Embiid  C - Rudy  I guess just have Rudy and Joel down low, Giannis to drive to open it up for an AD mid/3 point shot lol"
"I think Joel Embiid should be the front runner tbh, also Steph Curry should be leading the rest as well. Steph Curry is averaging 30 ppg. Also you can't forget about James, ??????."

"A lot of their success is based on unsustainable play from Joel Embiid. I can't believe people are falling for the ""Sixers are real contenders!"" shit yet again. At the end of the day, either Tobias Harris or Seth Curry is their second best half court threats and that's not enough."
Joel embiid is the best two way player in the nba
"Look, I want Lebron to win MVP. With all my heart. But unless warriors are a top 4 seed, it’s going to be Lebron or Embiid for MVP if they’re both healthy. Maybe give Joel the edge just because he’s insanely good and in his prime."
last year??  I don’t think steph deserves MVP at all even if they make it as an 8 seed btw. He’s amazing and fun as hell to watch but Joel Embiid and Jokic have just been so dominant this year.   If it goes to anyone other than them(assuming they both keep this pace &amp; the nuggets stop being average) it would continue become a pretty pointless award after Lebron got snubbed last year.

"&gt; The only people who think Embiid is the front runner are /r/nba users.  This is just not correct, and the people who determine the MVP are also morons some times and are sucking up to Bron. I love LeBron, he's my favorite non-Sixer, but make an argument other than ""media like bron""  Joel is putting up 29 per game on great efficiency and playing elite defense. When he's out, we kinda suck, when he's in, we're elite."
"joel ""do a 180"" embiid"
Joel “Politics” Embiid
Didn’t know I needed Rodney Hood guarding Joel Embiid until I saw it.  I think I’m a masochist
When I am under pressure at work I google image Joel Embiid and get motivated
"AD has missed 5 games and has been underperforming for the 21 games he played so far. Joel has missed 5 games while Tobias has been balling out, Ben looks better defensively while dropping a bit in PPG. LeBron hasn't missed a single game and has put in 300 more minutes than Embiid. He's literally had to carry more. Sixers minus Embiid have been better than Lakers minus Bron.  Lakers still have the better record in the harder conference."
"I was watching an interview a few years back at at an SI event. This one model, I couldn't get me eyes off her. She was a straight up dime.  2 years later, Joel marries and impregnates her.  So, Embiid is a Chad. He took the love of my life."
"Joel Embiid, weird and an example of how times have changed, but there's a nostalgic familiarity around their styles that helps you understand them"
This game should’ve been on TNT instead of the Sixers-Blazers  Steph Curry is a lot more fun and exciting to watch than Hospital Blazers vs  Joel Embiid/Simmons
I too think Joel Embiid is MVP
"The argument against him would be someone with potentially a better record and/or stats, such as Joel Embiid. The other argument would be the same reason why Durant and Curry never won MVP next to each other."
"Man... I just don't understand fans... I really don't. Every year, this ""fan voting"" is losing more and more credibility and probably is going negative in that category.   Im going to list some of my notable gripes with this list:  Kyrie having too many votes(Dude played like half their games)  Klay shouldn't be on the list  How is Trae still this low(Last year, had a worst team record and this year Hawks are a playoff team)  Still don't understand why Alex Caruso made the list  Joel Embiid but no Ben Simmons?   &amp;#x200B;  Glad it's only 50% but seriously needs to be lower... Fan voting is absolute troll nowadays."
Other than playing every game in a condensed schedule (would not recommend and obviously out of the players control a lot this year) there is nothing more Joel can do. He is scoring more points in fewer minutes and drastically better true shooting percentage. Not to mention he's probably playing like a top two defender this season.   LeBron is far more likely to play better than Embiid is honestly. Embiid isn't going to raise his TS% from 67% to 70+%. The award is already LeBron's unless the Lakers fall off. And with Anthony Davis and LeBron James I don't see that happening.
"Agreed. It’s proof how important Joel is. 17-3 when he plays, 1-4 when he doesn’t. That’s another big point for Embiid"
"Worse record in games actually played, on essentially the same schedule, and Joel is putting up better numbers.  I’ll agree Lebron is in 2nd or 3rd depending on how much you care about record, but Embiid is clearly the front runner."
"Alfred Joel ""Embiid"" Horford Reynoso"
"I’m putting him below Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Nikola Jokic, Bam Adebayo, KAT, Gobert"
"Yeah I don't get the salty comments here, just because majority of the votes are for LeBron doesn't mean it's not close between him and Joel so far.  It could be 70% votes for LeBron for now but majority of those weighed 52-48 LeBron vs. Embiid   And the last 6 games have really made a strong case for LeBron especially the fucking OTs that added 4 years to LeBron's body"
"Mavs instantly become the villains' of the NBA like Iceland in Mighty Ducks 2.  LeBron pledges to win the title for America, and comes out dressed like Apollo Creed in the Western Conference Finals. Luka breaks both of LeBron's legs in a freak dunking accident. Cuban laughs with his special guest Xi Jinping as everyone in America cries in shock. When asked for comment, Luka says [""If he dies, he dies.""](https://youtu.be/EiTYwecY41c)  Now Joel Embiid must rise to the challenge and defeat the evil Mavs."

Joel Embiid with a MONSTER 35 point game with 17/17 from the FT line.
- Donovan Mitchell has averaged 20.7 PPG on 35.4% shooting in his 7 game career vs Simmons.       - Joel Embiid has averaged 20.6 PPG on 40.5% shooting in his career 5 game career vs Gobert.       --      Whichever star can change that trend tonight probably does enough to lead their team to victory.
For some weird reason Joel Embiid shows up in the image for this thread on Reddit’s mobile app.

Then I'm assuming all the players are playing at the rate they are now, more or less.   -Jokic will not win from the fifth seed. Whether he should or not isn't what's being asked. He won't be considered a serious contender.   -Nets players won't be considered either. James Harden and KD and Kyrie, there's just too much talent there to give one of them the award for doing what most people expect them too.   -Giannis will not win the award. Again, maybe he should? But the voters won't consider it giving him the award for his dominance season. They will consider it giving him MVP three years in a row. That's not happening under any but the most extreme circumstances. And even then it's not very likely.   It's between LeBron and Embiid imo. Both the three seed. Embiid dominating in stats but LeBron has the narrative and support of the voters. If the Sixers were second seed it would be easily Embiid but that's not the question posed. I honestly think they'd give it to LeBron since everyone has something against them. He will also probably play more games than Embiid and that will be used against Joel. The only way Embiid wins is if he finishes with 30+ ppg, the first center doing so since Moses Malone."
Its ROTY frontrunner Joel Embiid and I couldn’t agree more!
"Yeah I didn’t mean it as a slight to Joel. They have pretty similar shot selection, both bang in the post a lot and draw a lot of contact. But for some reason Embiid gets the benefit of the doubt, and Jokic doesn’t. Honestly I think it’s just because Jokic is a big goofy motherfucker who looks uncoordinated haha."
"[Life is sweeter for NBA All-Star Joel Embiid, who is happy to put 'bust' label to rest](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/life-is-sweeter-for-nba-all-star-joel-embiid-who-is-happy-to-put-bust-label-to-rest/amp/)  - CBS Sports 2018"
"yea + in previous years ben/embiid minutes were split so 76ers had great minutes when Ben was on the bench and Joel was playing with bench vs other teams bench (and this year in 115 mins with Tobias+bench 76ers def rating is at 95.0, probably  fluke)"
"Just ask Joel ""Do a 180"" Embiid"
"That's a joke of a call. Reminds me of when Pascal Siakam got a flagrant for [intentionally tripping Embiid](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/03/raptors-pascal-siakam-flagrant-foul-tripping-sixers-joel-embiid-video) two years ago. And if anything, Booker's foul here was more egregious since he used his hands. Makes no sense to call that a common foul."
"Genuinely this is the first time I've seen people meme on him like that, most people just clown on him for not being able to stop Joel Embiid (like there's any center in the east that can do that right now lol)"
"James Johnson. dudes a blackbelt and legitimately already looks like an inmate.  Tyler Johnson also already looks like an inmate.  basically the 2017 Miami Heat. inmates  Shaq, KG, Lance, Stephenson, Joel Embiid, Kyrie, Jokic could all be good character roles. (for some reason i picture Jokic wearing a beanie that is entirely way to small for his head in the movie)  ugh im lost on the Adam Sandler role. i picked a lot of modern nba players.. so i guess i want to say Lillard(?) for that role. idk"
Joel “Despite the Win” Embiid
"Jokic! He’s more constant and consistent. Embiid is too damn emotional and violate plus the pettiness too. Joel more be more athletic but jokic is the more skilled ( shooting , passing , game iq etc)."
The disrespect to Joel Embiid...
"LOL why?  Philly have the best record in the est with his 2nd best scorer out for 5 games, and Harris is having 20ppg on basically 50/40/90 shooting splits.  Embiid too missed 6 games and Simmons missed 5.  They're still up there despite this, mostly because of Joel."
I️ once saw Joel run 5 straight pick n pops at the top of the key. No one else touched the ball. I️ wish I️ was exaggerating. At some point that’s Brett Browns fault...  Look at the diversity of different areas he’s shot from this year. That’s not a coincidence. 19-20’ was solid. 18-19’ was atrocious. 20-21’ has been the best  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-shot-chart-by-season

"Like, I know it's a thing that Joel Embiid used to drink multiple milkshakes after games, but I kind of get it. He's an outlier even for the NBA, but it's kind of wild to think about how much some of these guys must have to eat to not just straight lose 20 pounds during a season.   The nutritionist mentions it in the article too that sometimes some candy or something can help get the calories in, but I would guess that a lot of NBA players aren't too concerned about the snickers bar."
"&gt;It's not even a question that he is a max contract player, he is an all nba all defense perennial all star, and every single gm would give him the max if they had the chance.  bad ones, yes they would. why od you think morey was trying to unload him for harden?  &gt;The last time Ben was in the playoffs they were 4 bounce shot away from beating the champs.  because they had jimmy fuckkng butler and Joel embiid lol"
"&gt; Damn that’s a lot of nonsense you replied with  Whatever you say man  &gt;Again, Embiid is great no doubt, but he isn’t even playing much defense this season because he’s had to focus on being sometimes our sole offensive option on a given night.  That's not true because morey properly identified the weaknesses of the Sixers and fixed it. Ben is barely the third best defensive player not he team behind thybulle and Joel.   &gt;Yes that statement is based on what happens on the court.  The problem is you don't back up anything you are syaing/, you realize this right? According to RAPTOR, PIPM, RPM, RAPM (requires 250 games), guess who leads ben ''''''''DPOY''''''' Simmons sizably by every single metric? Joel embiid  &gt;He sometimes only guards them for one half then chills because it’s the regular season and we usually win these games without him going crazy for two halves (think load management defensively)   You two discussed this together?  &gt;His versatility and perimeter defense is unmatched by anyone in the league  Lol get this through your head: rim protection trumps being able to switch on the perimeter and guard a pick n roll (which results with Joel doing the actual heavy lifting).  &gt;no ones even close to what he can do  Sixers fans have to be absolutely delusional to believe this, right?. Anyways, there are many players that do what ben does (covington, draymond, kahwi when his offensive load is smaller). I would be made as well if my star point guard couldn't make a shot outside the paint then I might get defensive over it and lie about his defense to justify it in my mind. Actually I wouldn't' do that because im not a moron"
"\&gt;Name me aside of Kawhi, Simmons and Draymond green another player who can guard 5 positions.  Herein lies your problem: you're conflating defense with ''''guarding''''? What does that mean? Is it quantifiable? Or are things like rim protection the most important thing? Clearly the latter.   FYI: this season in 300 mins without Joel guess what ben's net rating is? -9 and his defensive rating is 117. really horrible for someone who is supposedly the best defensive player in the league  \&gt;Embiid is a great defender and I would have put him at the place of Myles Turner but Simmons deserves that #1 spot  No embiid is a defensive juggernaut he's not just 'great' he is anchoring an incredible defense."
"I mean we're 1-6 without Embiid, but also the dude is our entire offense as well as most of our defensive scheme so it's hard to really compare.  Joel and Ben complement each other super well on defense so it helps Ben knowing he has backup if he loses his guy.    I think Ben is the most impactful 1-4 defender in the league probably but it's so hard to compete for DPOY when centers are the one defending the actual rim lol"
"If you just watch these 4 different players you'd know the difference.  Trae at a point was doing this flopping shit on every jump shot, every drive. There's multiple points where he's lost games due to looking for calls instead of just looking to make a shot.  There's also shit like [this](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/02/10/0022000384/631/9f95c252-04e0-21df-f8a8-bb427672d715_1280x720.mp4). This is not the type of shit you should pull at clutch time. Due to him doing this the Mavs got a fast break and his team had to foul.  Lloyd Pierce is also not the coach of Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and James Harden."
*Joel “roll out of bed and get a 30/10” Embiid has entered the chat*
"Did you watch tape of Ayton outside of youtube highlights? If you went by stats and athleticism he was a 20/11 guy with 65% TS which is spectacular and more than any other 1 and done center that I can think of including Greg Oden and Joel Embiid. Also with his 7 foot height and 7'6"" wingspan to go with his [hops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeBhoVeFhT4) he arguably had a more elite combo of height/length/athleticism than any center since Shaq and more than Dwight Howard."
Do you consider Joel Embiid to be black?
philly is what? yeah they want to suck the ownership's dick now but the philly media is anything but supportive.   this dude is the franchise's mouthpiece  https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-sixers-joel-embiid-utah-jazz-20210215.html
"&gt;He'd make it hard enough to where Embiid wouldn't be putting up the statistically impossible shooting numbers he's putting up now in the playoffs  There's no evidence for that right now; Joel had 42 points on 13/22 FG, 2/3 from 3pt, and 14/16 FT. I will concede that the number of free throws Joel gets will go down slightly in the playoffs, but his offensive efficiency was not hampered at all by Allen (6ast : 3tov as well for what that's worth). The reason we lost that game was that literally everyone except Jo and Ben shit the bed simultaneously"

I like how they start the article by saying MVP is a two man race between Joel Embiid and James Harden.   And then a couple paragraphs down they call Durant the Nets best player.
"Total homer take here as well but something I just thought was interesting since Zach’s ppg almost cost him off this list. Is the dude gets no foul calls. Especially as someone who drives a ton.  Per basketball reference of free throws attempted per game out of every player in the NBA:  1.Joel Embiid at 11.7  2. Giannis at 10.56  5. Beal at 8.14  9. Dame Dollar at 7.53  23. Steph at 5.53  28. Lavine 5.29  While it may not seem like a ton, Zach gets his buckets at the rim way more then Curry and gets very little calls. Those extra 2-3 ppg from free throws put him as a top scorer in the league.  Again no real analysis here towards the post other than comparing to these players, but Zach finished at the rim just as much as anyone and isnt getting recognized even as much as he should because he’s getting no calls.  Edit: mobile formatting sux nuts."
"Hes too tall, someone like Joel Embiid or Steve Curry deserves it more"
"See, it's easy to say that when your team is has had the likes of Allen Iverson &amp; currently Joel Embiid playing on your roster, but when your franchise has become pretty much a living meme among, not only the league, but across sports....you learn to take the victories where you get them.     Especially when the media has made it a mission to stir up a lot of the controversy and drama that surrounds the team."
"When you have Joel Embiid on the team, how could you not expect them on there"
"Iirc it was a Jeopardy question that asked what his nickname was, and the contestant answered ""Do a 180"" rather than ""The Process"", which was the correct answer. Embiid then changed his Twitter name to Joel ""Do a 180"" Embiid."
"We could also put the factors from lasts nights game in to play, the mavs had nothing to help him with and they would double him at points due to him being the only threat, you also have Joel embiid to help with that shit so pick and rolls are incredibly difficult. If lebron fucking James is backing away from the rim when gobert is there you got to respect it"
"Uh yeah you had a choice. The 2 teams that cover Embiid the best in my opinion are the Raptors and Celtics with small lineups. They mastered the art of doubling from every angle or faking those doubles and it confuses Joel often, trying to guard Joel 1on1 with any big is gonna be trouble most of the time."
this isn't true: Joel Embiid currently is averaging 28.9 pts per 36 minutes in his career (236 games)
"It’s a mix of both. He had a great start to the season, and it was a real breath of fresh air for sixers fans to not see our leads immediately evaporate when Joel sits. He provides solid rim protection, rebounding, and interior defense that we’ve never really had behind Joel before.   That said, he then hit a bit of a skid. He played pretty poorly for a month and we were getting at most 15 mins a night with him. Part of that is he’s older and foul prone, and it’s hard for him to stay on the floor for long periods of time. Part of it is he’s not a great fit with the hybrid bench unit Doc seems to favor, where Ben runs with the Shake/Tisse/Howard+ one of Korkmaz or Mike Scott (both of whom have been in and out of the lineup with injuries).   There’s not enough shooting in those bench lineups, which lead to offensive stagnation and some rough games for Dwight where he was fouling too much.  He is basically the same as last year, an impact player who due to age and play style is very matchup dependent.   So really, both things are true. He’s the best backup we’ve had for Embiid, and he has games and matchups where he dominates and we love to have him. At the same time, having one more option at the five spot, particularly someone who can stretch the floor for those Ben+Tisse lineups, would also be a huge benefit to our bench production."

"Same. I got told earlier today that Jokic was a better scorer than Embiid because of what he did in last year's playoffs. Nevermind that we have hundreds of games in the regular season that tells us Embiid is a significantly better scorer, no let's throw all that away and focus on a sample size of a few series in the bubble. And let's also act like Joel didn't average 30 in the Boston series with no point guard.   And yeah too many people are talking about this man's playoffs like it's Playoff Kawhi or Playoff LeBron."
"Doncic has never scored more than 19 points against the sixers, Ben and Joel are his kryptonite lol  kinda sad the mavs didnt do a better opposition as I wanted Embiid to do some numbers in the 4th instead of finishing 5/20 lol"
"He's better than Embiid and whoever else you have. More versatile than Joel, does great on elite offensive talent."
I’ll say it. Joel Embiid flops sometimes.
"Why are you laughing? At yourself maybe? Watch the sixers consistently. Embiid can be a better defender but only quarters at a time, Ben plays hard all game... On the other teams best player. The sixers defense when no one is injured or out due to covid OR If you just looked at Ben and Joel lineups you will see they are a top defense in the league smh. How do people seriously use team stats this season when things are so jagged?"
"""Joel Embiid would have to take a large leap at age 27 to becoming arguably the best player in the league (unlikely)"" this didn't hold up ;-)"
"“However, Haynes reports that the Lakers reportedly never gave a formal offer to Howard, and instead, they had a “deal concept.” He was then forced to delete the tweet.  Then, while waiting to hear back from the Lakers to see if he had an official offer to accept, Howard accepted a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. He will now play with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons this season.”   [if you want more info here’s a link just summarizing the whole situation ](https://www.sportscasting.com/dwight-howard-lets-everyone-know-what-happened-between-him-and-the-lakers/?amp)"
The disparity in hate for foul drawing between Harden vs Embiid is.... interesting. Joel is scoring like 30% of his points from FTs
Ben should be the current leader but it’s also extremely bogus that embiid isn’t on the list at all. Ben and Joel combined multiple times on Luka PNR to shut them down
Imagine being Luka and you’re getting double teamed by Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid and you’re best option to pass to is Boban Marjonavic.
"Classic Joel Embiid, too short to get a board against the opposing center"
"very nice of zlatan to defend embiid, but joel doesnt mind if people speak about him."
"Joel adds something new to his arsenal every time he plays with someone like a freaking anime character. With Lowry, Embiid will be taking charges every other possession by next season"
"I mean I think you're overall point about it being a negligible difference versus Lebron and his teammates is true, but you're undermining your own point by only comparing Seth's career % to Embiid's season %. Especially when we can easily access both and just paint an objective picture.  **Career:**  Seth Curry - 85%  Joel Embiid - 80%   **This Season:**  Seth Curry - 94%  Joel Embiid - 85%"
"Holy fuck these nerds think Mike fucking Conley is as impactful as Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid because a stat told them to.  Joel Embiid is an MVP candidate carrying his team to first in the East and somehow Mike Conley is on par with him? What reaction do you think you would garner from say, the NBA on TNT crew if you said that Mike Conley is ""as impactful"" as that list becuase RAPTOR said so."
Probably. But who knows what Joel Embiid looks like in 3 years. Who knows how good our supporting pieces are.   People shit on the Celtics for hoarding assets and not pulling triggers. I don’t wanna be like that. I want to go all in and win a championship
"He's from Philly, if he's asking to be traded here there will be an understanding he'll re-sign. Tyrese Maxey is a bit of a project and Joel Embiid is a superstar in his prime. Timetable matters here."
"Yeah nah bro. 2 seasons ago Embiid put up fucking 27/14/4, this aint a one season thing Joel will forever be better"
Just cause he had a good game that does not mean that he was not best player on the floor. It’s clearly Joel Embiid and Rudy Gobert.
I am yet to see Ben Simmons put a resume together to prove that he’s an all-star player. He has not been in any big moments on his career and is shadowed by Joel Embiid.
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"We might not win the finals but I know damn well  Joel and Ben own your franchise. Embiid averages 31, 9, 5 vs the lakers and Ben 17, 9, 8. So whatever at least we’re rent free in your head."
We just battled Joel Embiid and we’re making our game against Miami a close game. Playing back to backs is part of being an nba player tf u mean “give them a break”
Dude they were claiming that Joel Embiid was a lazy defender.  Claiming that they were better then Brooklyn and the Sixers at .500.  Moaning and high pitched on any spin move by Pascal.  Watch a full game and you will have them muted.
"Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic own advanced metrics, but the ~~LeBron James~~ Media narrative is pushed down people's throats. FTFY"
"Joel Hans ""Politics"" ""Troel"" Embiid"
As a true non-ESPN watcher I got the sense Joel Embiid was recieving the universal media hype. But then again if they want anyone to pay attention they talk about LeBron and maybe Steph. I might give ESPN a watch outside the games. Does the team on The Jump say he's MVP?
"What?? Why Harden? Joel Embiid is unstoppable right now, and Harden is on a stacked offensive team. Gtfo.."

Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Dedicated to Joel Embiid
"Shaq: I dont want to talk about Joel, I want to talk about Embiid"
"I disagree. Embiid can space the floor and is dominant in the paint. His rim protection is elite which allows even great perimeter defenders like Ben the opportunity to play even more aggressively. Jokic and Ben would have overlapping skillsets to me. They score similarly in their careers, assist similarly and both provide offenses for their team. Can't go wrong with those two obviously but Joel being a higher level scorer than Jokic is more what Ben needs to compliment his game rather than another high level passer from the center position."
"dont have lineup data rn, but from [last season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=ben+simmons+stats+without+joel+embiid+in+2019-20)  without embiid, simmons has more space to drive. his scoring game improves, he has upped points with higher efficiency"
"People constantly do this after every Sixers game like our two best players aren't Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. We constantly attack the rim. I've seen every Sixers game this season and trust me they let a lot of calls that are normally called for Embiid go, especially on the perimeter, these last two games.   Downvote me all you guys want it's the truth. My point was the refs were swallowing the whistle the entire two game series and them missing the Simmons foul didn't surprise me in the least because they have been very reluctant to call fouls. This notion that the fouls have to be even is misguided. The teams rarely play the same and rarely get fouled the same amount."

Makes no sense considering we had Pascal at C and they have Joel fucking Embiid on the court. Of course they are going to get more FT attempts they outmatch us in size and physicality by a long shot.
"Nope, Luka went from overhyped MVP bookie preseason to the most underrated top 5/10 player in the league.  ---  BPM  1. Jokic 11.1 2. Embiid 8.7 3. Luka 7.6 4. Giannis 7.5 5. Curry 7.4 6.

"No offense to Philly fans, Joel Embiid is my pick for MVP, and y'all are having an incredible season...     # ... BUT HOW DID BEN SIMMONS MAKE IT..."
Jokic needs to invest earlier and more often in the refs. Embiid makes sure he gets workin in that ref's ear 2nd quarter at the absolute LATEST 😂   Disclaimer: I recognize how good of a player Joel Embiid is and agree that he is the current frontrunner for MVP but let's go Jokic
  Because Joel Embiid
"&gt;no one on the team was able to step up  Idk about that one, chief.  Since nobody outside of Ben and Joel showed up for the game on the 21st, you could make that argument for that game.   In tonight’s game Furk and Tobias showed up, and Danny played good defence on Fred all night.   Not disagreeing on Embiid being the MVP front runner, but let’s call a spade a spade here."
https://sports.yahoo.com/joel-embiid-falls-down-lot-120043564.html  Here’s an article explaining it and you can still disagree if you want it doesn’t bother me at all lol
LeBron: “here Joel you can have the MVP”  Embiid: “nah fam I’m good”
"Kind of reminds me a bit of Joel Embiid when he was a rookie, out here joking around and having fun."
Joel “Do a 180” Embiid
"For one, Joel Embiid isn't from Europe, he's Cameroonian. Next, you bring up soccer and completely ignore how ridiculously common it is for stars to ask for transfers there. Sure, fans are unhappy but very few top players care enough to stay put in bad teams anyway. Finally, neither Jokic, Giannis nor Vucevic played for a Euroleague champion, none of them played for Real Madrid. I'm not saying that that Doncic will surely ask for a trade if things don't go according to plan. But if you don't acknowledge that someone who's played for the kings of Europe and won titles as their best player at age 18 might be more open to asking for a trade from the get go than other players who aren't as used to dominating every tournament they play in, you're blissfully unaware of just how little top European clubs and leagues care about parity."
"Well if we’re talking about European sport culture we might as well talk about soccer, and i don’t think it’s apples to oranges because they view teams and levels of play differently. In terms of European/foreign stars in the NBA, i haven’t seen a pattern of them demanding they leave when things don’t go well. Nikola jokic isn’t asking to leave, giannis isn’t ring chasing even tho his team has failed (by their standards) the last 3 years, Joel embiid screaming trust the process at every turn. Hell, nikola vucevic chilling down in Orlando and look at them. I don’t think it’s really a trend, no evidence for it."
Joel Embiid has never made a conference final in a weak conference... how can you compare him to any top 5 player in the league yet
Also helps that the Joker carried his team to a WCF appearance while Embiid flamed out in the 1st round looking out of shape in a sweep by the Celtics.  If the roles were reversed Joel would get much more attention.
"It is, but Joel's gravity can not be understated. Our only loss was without Joel this season, and it's clear because we basically run our entire offensive scheme through him: pass to Jo, if it's a one-on-one, let him feast, if they double him, he passes out, and we hockey pass the ball around to find the open shooter.   Joel isn't necessarily passing to the guy who will shoot directly (so not showing up as assists or in the stat sheet), but his gravity is creating amazingly open looks that are allowing guys like seth curry to have a career year so far with better 3P% then most players regular FG%. Almost all our 3s are wide open shots when Joel is on the floor it's incredible.   So he doesn't have the same direct passing ability Jokic has, his gravity is essentially creating just as many easier buckets even though they won't show up in his stats as assists. He doesn't get stat assists but the eye test shows that any time he passes out of double team, he may not be the last to pass before the ball finds the open man, but he is the reason we got a man open to begin with.   Combine with defensive prowess and pretty close offensive numbers, as well as better team record so far and me being a homer, I'm so far putting Embiid a bit above Jokic this year (and homer may I be, I had Jokic over Embiid last year)."
"2014 in hindsight turned to be such a dud class, the ONLY lottery pick that turned into an All-Star 6 years on was Joel Embiid (who missed his first 2 seasons). The other All-Star in that class was some fat Serbian kid taken in the 2nd round.  The best player not named Embiid taken in the lottery is either one of Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine, TJ Warren or Julius Randle.   The rest have been varying degrees of underwhelming (Wiggins, Gordon, Payton, McDermott), ruined by injuries (Parker, Exum) or straight-up out of the league (Stauskas, Vonleh)"
"Joel is actually averaging more points than Jokic. Obviously playmaking is far and away in Jokics favor with assists, but Seth and Tobias are obviously taking huge steps offensively because the gravity Embiid is creating. The same way that you argue Jokics defense is closer to Embiid than people think is funnily enough one that could be made for Embiid offensively to Jokic.  Love both of them though! Cant wait for the upcoming duel."
"Joel has always been pretty solid defensively, and yes it's a small sample size, but coming into tonight Embiid was only trailing Drummond in defensive rating.  Simmons and Tobias Harris are/were 3rd and 4th, respectively."
"On this day, January 6, 2021 Joel Embiid gained a nephew."
"Embiid is a dominant scorer that's always drawn a lot of attention inside but he's definitely improved at running fast breaks, shooting, and passing this season. Maybe I'm just getting too excited, but I think we're watching a breakout season from Joel."
I like playing with Joel Embiid
"I’m obviously a Sixers fan, but man, that look in Beal’s eyes as he took the FTs crushed me. That felt like a gut punch.  Fire Scott Brooks, Washington. Do the right damn thing.  Meanwhile, Joel Embiid 2021 MVP?"
I do not like playing against Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid good.
"Joel ""Trae Young"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid is big and strong
"More like whoever plays better the last couple of games. Jokic had one of the best playoff performances in the league but apparently now this sub thinks Joel Embiid is better because he beat the mighty NBA powerhouses of the Knicks, the Cavs, the Hornets and the Wizards."
Imagine reffing a game featuring Joel Embiid and giving somebody else a warning for flopping.
"Joel embiid is easily the best player on the sixers, and has leagues better impact then Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons is a good defender, and transition passer, and play maker. Unfortunately, with his inability to shoot, he limits himself and his team. He will never be able to be the best player in a series as long as he can’t shoot, and Embiid is on his team. Be realistic and stop being braindead"
"bias ass refs lol, joel embiid literally fell from lamelo ball and gordon hayward touching him these past two games  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRqBHBDj7L8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRqBHBDj7L8)"
Joel embiid is better than jokic
"Joel Embiid. His post possessions were insanely efficient last season despite playing next to Ben ""same spacing effect as Timofey Mozgov"" Simmons."
"Davis performed nearly as well in the playoffs. he was the second best player in the entire playoffs, and its not an isolated thing. he was dominant in the postseason on the pelicans as well. the fact of the matter is its much easier to build a championship team around davis than it is jokic.   Any team will require at least two stars on it. there are a plethora of ball dominant stars in the league. There arent many stars who can play the defensive big role while also providing great isolation scoring and pnr partnership. The next closest would be joel embiid but hes not as versatile as davis defensively and hes not as good of a shooter either.   Davis is a seamless fit alongside basically every star, while jokic is not because of average defense."
Joel Embiid and being a winning basketball player.
Former sixers GM had a burner twitter where he said some funny shit    https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz
"the real test is coming up, joel embiid."
"I personally don't see it as a huge difference. We switch it a little more, are more aggressive in PnR coverage and like I said Joel is a step or two forward, but the principles are the same. The largest difference I've noticed has been in more help defense and a willingness to scramble a little more rather than being so worried about giving up 3's.  It's still drop coverage, just with more variability mixed in. Joel is anchored in the paint protecting the rim, Dwight runs the same role for the backup unit. Joel is not going out onto the perimeter, his habits will naturally keep him stationed in the middle. https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/sixers-defense-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-doc-rivers-dan-burke-nba  Like, our defense is good because of Joel and Ben. I don't think Doc has brought some kind of defensive revolution and unlocked our team that was held back before."
"For me, it's gotta be this: [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2745707-joel-embiid-shouts-out-jalen-rose-after-saying-hes-81-percent-healthy](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2745707-joel-embiid-shouts-out-jalen-rose-after-saying-hes-81-percent-healthy)"
"Yeah, and clearly LeBron didn't trust either of those teams to get it done.   Joel Embiid can't even stay healthy or stay in shape. Simmons can't shoot. And they had no one to trade to get someone of Davis' caliber.   Houston, after they gave CP3 that terrible deal, had very little flexibility.   I don't think LeBron came because he thought he could win with Ingram and Lonzo. You don't generally win titles with guys that young in the NBA. I do think that LeBron knew that the Lakers had a good chance to get a star via free agency to supplement Ingram and the young guys or trade the young guys for a star were one to become available. And that's exactly what they did as soon as Davis wanted out of New Orleans.  That's not even mentioning that LeBron saw the flexibility the Lakers had to keep adding on after getting a star. He didn't want to get trapped like he was in Cleveland."
"Sticking with my pick for Ben Simmons as MIP. I truly believe the new roster will allow him to play the best version of himself as a point forward. Also, Joel Embiid DPOY?"
"I’m not saying that Drummond is some bum, but I’ve watched every matchup of Drummond vs Embiid, and it is much more clear than the stats indicate which player has the edge in the matchup. Now duh Embiid will be the better player in most head-to-heads with other centers, but Embiid loves playing against Drummond because historically Embiid can frustrate Drummond, like, a lot. Drummond has fouled out and received techs in games against Embiid, which he feeds on and in turn serves as fuel for the Sixers in general.  I’m not saying it WOULD have happened in their last game, but history points to Embiid getting the better of Drummond not just on the court but in the mental game.  (Also in a lot of those games I distinctly remember Drummond’s coach trying to get him as much time on the court without Joel as possible)"
"""Through 7 games, Myles Turner is defending a league-leading 10.3 shots at the rim and holding opponents to a league-best 43.1% on those attempts.  1. Myles Turner - 43.2% on 10.3 DFGA 2. Ivica Zubac - 47.4% on 5.4  3. Rudy Gobert - 48.9% on 7.8 4. Joel Embiid - 49% on 8.2""   - from https://twitter.com/iPacersblog/status/1346537083544940544  Another helpful stat in evaluating Myles is the Pacers being 4th in OPP FG% inside of 5ft. Point is, Myles is currently playing Rudy Gobert level defense while being a legitimate 3pt threat on offense. It is early, so I understand hesitating before putting him top 10 for centers league wide. But if this trend continues, he could end up being one of the best value contracts in the league, especially in light of the albatross contract Gobert just signed."
"Embiid, Simmons, Curry, Milton, Maxey, Thybulle, and I guess Dwight.  Harris has been playing great but if someone wants to take that max contract, I'm not gonna stop them.  You could convince me either way for Dwight/Danny, but I think having a serviceable backup for Joel is most important."
MVP: Paul George MIP: Christian Wood ROTY: LaMelo Ball DPOY: Joel Embiid FINALS: Lakers/Bucks Champs: Lakers FMVP: LeBron
"If this is your honest argument (and I don't agree with it), I don't even see how you could conversely argue Haslem is still in the league. He played 4 games last season, and hasn't played one this year yet, and I wouldn't at all be surprised if that doesn't happen at all this year.  Joel Embiid didn't enter the league in October 2016.  That's just not how it works."
"The sport will fellate big men who draw fouls and go so far as to encourage ""getting down low to draw fouls and slow down the game""  Why people moan about guards adopting a strategy big men have been using for decades is beyond me. Kobe amd Jordan were great at drawing fouls (rip through me, jumping into contact, post ups, etc.) Guys like Harden and Trae have learned how to draw contact with a more perimeter oriented game.  It's the same strategy on different parts of the floor. If Joel Embiid was drawing the same number of fouls it would 100% be something he would be praised for"
Joel Embiid  Jaylen Brown (prolly a stretch)  Wiseman (but my heart says P rabbit)  Embiid  Lebron  Lakers vs Nets  Nets
"Curry ALREADY works better with Joel in the post than JJ ever did. JJ mostly utilized dribble handoffs, wipe open and transition 3s. Curry/Embiid 2 man game is as hard to guard as any 2 man, we will start to see a lot of weak side help, which was always the bane of Embiid anyway."
“Jokic beat kawhi” kawhi was certainly no match for that ferocious Denver defense lead by the stone wall Jokic holding kawhi to less than 15 pts in game 7. Where as Swiss cheese defender Joel Embiid let kawhi walk all over him for a quick 39 pts in their game 7. The kawhi in 2019 was awful and the sixers just couldn’t stop him whereas the kawhi in 2020 was just world beating and yet Jokic somehow still managed to completely shut him down.....righhhht yea sure
Benjamin Simmons and Joel Embiid still haven't lost to the Knicks and Hornets
"Even fucking Ala getting in on the ""now they play the right way.""   It is absolutely a testament to the talent of Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid we even made the playoffs with Clown Coach."
"Ben Simmons, Donavan Mitchell, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid."
Ben Simmons   JJ reddick   Jimmy butler   Tobias Harris   Joel Embiid
Having Harden between Joel Embiid and Jayson Tatum seems like a crime.
"We're really looking at the reg season? Jokic in the last two playoffs averaged 25.1ppg on 59.6 TS% and 24.4ppg on 61.4 TS%, with a sample size of 14 and 19 games respectively. Embiid in his last two playoffs averaged 20.2ppg on 55.9 TS% and 30ppg on 60 TS%. Just saying, Jokic averages more PPG for his playoff career.. You're free to argue Embiid &gt; Jokic, which I could maybe agree with assuming Embiid's passing out of doubles sticks and he stays at a DPOY level. But they're not really close on offense. Embiid just outscores Jokic in the reg season, but during the playoffs, he scores less efficiently and is a far worse passer. So, what's your excuse for Embiid averaging less PPG and on less efficiency?  And yeah, Joel has been better at passing out of doubles this year, but I'd like to see him do it for longer, and do it in the playoffs. Unlike a substantial part of r/NBA, I don't believe in declaring players as changed until they've managed to do something for quite some time. On the flip side, guys who have consistently been good get a break."
"Embiid has twice as many 40 point games in his career as Jokic. Jo also averages more ppg this year and for his career, in fact his ppg for his career is higher than Jokic has ever averaged in a single year. Jokic has slightly better shooting splits this year and for his career but Joel does it on higher volume and gets to the line a lot more. As for passing out of doubles, I guess you haven't watched the 6ers at all this year bc anyone with eyes can see he's much improved. Jokic is also tied for the league lead in turnovers per game so far."
Joel embiid is literally nothing like Shaq.
Joel Embiid is doing those numbers and Wilt was far more talented. So no.
Joel embiid is my pick this year.
He had nowhere to go but up. His only meaningful contribution to Philadelphia was Joel Embiid mask memes.
The only Shaq versus current center matchup I’d want to see is Shaq vs Joel Embiid.  Shaq would bully his way on offense but then Embiid would have Shaq fouling out with his Hakeem moves
"These are not my predictions but simply my picks right now, two weeks into the season.  MVP: James Harden (37! ppg)  DPOY: idk...Joel Embiid maybe  ROTY: Tyrese Haliburton...although I think LaMelo pulls ahead by the end of the season  6MOY: Terrence Ross  MIP: Christian Wood. Jaylen might be slightly better this year but Wood made a bigger jump from last year.  COTY: Monty Williams"
"May i ask how it feels...  How it feels deep down all that emotional investment into the 76ers , joel embiid , ben simmons wont ever win a championship in philly? Like it must suck every day and night knowing that. Knowing that Your point guard cant shoot to save his life."
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
If Ainge ends up with Joel Embiid I’ll start shitting out gold bars and I’ll mail them to you.
"In the championship run he was getting guarded by Jonathon Isaac, Joel Embiid  / Ben Simmons, Giannis and Draymond Green.  People act like he never saw a double in 2018-19 and Kawhi somehow made his shots super easy. In 2018-19 he would run hard in transition, but he also had a great touch around the rim, had an amazing shot from the corner, could rebound aggressively and could call his own number in the post. He had ball fakes, spin moves, up and unders and had such a great feel for the glass that anytime the ball would touch the glass it was going in.  I'm not saying he's not getting any more defensive attention, but that's like, 15-20% max of what's the issue. He's still getting open corner looks from three, his role change shouldn't suddenly change the result of those"
"All just my opinion ... but they can’t win it all because they just aren’t good enough, with or without Kemba. Ainge needs to turn some of those assets into Joel Embiid or James Harden or something like that."

Joel embiid averaged 36 games per season his first six seasons compared to 75 games for AD
Embiid half shoving and moving LaMelo Ball down low looks hilarious. Make you realize how massive Joel is.
"Wow you’re smarter than most people on this subreddit.  Kawhi Leonard is top 3 though. In what world are Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Joel Embiid better than Kyrie Irving?  Decent list, but not perfect."
I doubt Joel Embiid has a decade long prime. He's already 26 and will be 27 in a few months. How long are you going to wait for Ben to become a league average FT shooter and attempt shots beyond 10ft from the basket with any degree of regularity.  If James Harden is stoppable I don't know what to call Ben Simmons. Pretty sure Harden and Embiid can work fine together as they foul out opposing lineups like clockwork.
"The disrespect to Joel ""Do a 180"" Embiid"
"Good lord, Joel Embiid is averaging better than 25/12 on 64% true shooting and elite defense.   I mean, the recipe for a championship these days is a top 7 player, another all star or two and shooting. It’s a big if, but the ceiling of Embiid/Simmons/Harris/Curry/Green/Thybulle/Milton is a real thing"
"For all those saying Joel Embiid, come back when he can play more than 64 games in a season. Don’t get me wrong, his stats are pretty good, actually really good, but when he can play(not start, just play) more games, like KAT, Jokic, Bam, and he’ll even Brook and Robin Lopez, then he’ll be the best in the league by a loooooonnnnnggg shot. Until then I’m still going to say Joel Embiid."
"I don’t know, but that Denver “Big 3” isn’t winning anything.  First of all.... they play in Denver.  Nikola Jokić is a very overrated player. I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, or Joel Embiid than Nikola Jokić. It’s close with Trae Young.   Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. might never be all stars in their career too. Kind of embarrassing to call them a big 3 when these two players are a tier below borderline all stars. They are garbage defensively too.  The only reason they beat the Clippers is because of Doc Rivers and the bubble. Nuggets were pretenders before the season began if you actually watched NBA games."
Embiid is the clear pick in terms of size and skill The only concerns is that Joel is so injury prone that he’ll be a DNP by the 3rd game after receiving 6 of Shaq’s drop step elbows.
"Centers are a little shaky defending the three, I think Ben would have to be a bit better than Joel from three to get defenders to stick to him him and bite on the pump fake like they do for embiid."
Probably Steven Adams or Joel Embiid
"Gobert. He doesn’t get to show it off much in today’s league, but Rudy is an unbelievably good post defender. Embiid is the closest approximation to Shaq in today’s league and he’s struggled mightily against Gobert (IIRC H2H Joel has shot 42% against Rudy). Jokic has found success from midrange and 3 against Rudy but more or less abandons the post game. It would come down to officiating, but I firmly believe Gobert could more than hold his own defending Shaq, and certainly more than any other center in today’s league."
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
Why the disrespect for Joel Embiid and KAT?
That's not the reason at all. The only reason we are possibly looking at trading simmons is that embiid has a shorter window. He turns 27 this year and is injuryprone. Itd be stupid to pair simmons and harden not only because simmons is worse than embiid but also because harden is even older than joel so that wouldn't help our window or drastically improve our chances.

You want Joel Embiid to dunk a basketball inside you?
And yet Joel Embiid keeps forgetting how to basketball against 'em.
"Even if he doesnt play at that high of a level I still think he will have better career than many. Having Jonas Valanciunas on steroids career is no shame it will pick you up some all star spots, one or two all nba teams(if some of the star centers have off year but i dont think he will be better than Embiid /Jokic). That will mean he would be top 5 center in era(if big boys keep ballin) of Jokic, Joel, Bam, Rudy, Vucevic(maybe exiting his prime) and Robin Lopez. Like in 80s and 90s you had Ewing, Hakeem, Admiral, Shaq and then you had Dikembe with 3 all nba teams, Zo with 2, Parish 2 and so on and Idk but I think all of them are hall of fame. Position is stacked"
"No awards show according to the ESPN article  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31479904/nikola-jokic-stephen-curry-joel-embiid-named-finalists-nba-mvp-award  &gt;The NBA is reverting to its longtime tradition this year and announcing the various award winners during the playoffs, as opposed to the recently created end-of-season awards show. The league did the same thing during its bubble at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, last year."
Joel embiid about to be 5th man of the year on this squad.
"Not the OP, but I do, yes.  Because Embiid does the same thing.   Don't take my word for it : https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/05/10/joel-embiid-falls-down-a-lot-because-his-doctors-told-him-to/"
"&gt; He goes 1st ahead of Joel Embiid because centers are seen as less important than wings in the league.   Also cause Embiid was injured, lol."
"&gt; Centers are not allowed to use their physicality to impact the game like they use to and you can't even breath on guards without getting a foul called.  You realize Joel Embiid had the highest free throw rate in history this year, right?  Dude shot 11 free throws a game playing 31mpg lol."
"I think they're gonna be willing to put in more money, you find the next Joel Embiid it should pay for the investment. These guys have never been as worth more as they are now with the way celebrity culture is."
"Right, and I totally get that the guys missing for Atlanta arent nothing but there’s also consideration for the idea that you have to expect a certain level of injury over the course of a season you’re never gonna have your full rotation go the full 82. Comparing their game log to Miami’s, Indy’s, or Boston’s (or even Brooklyn’s or Philly’s) you have Jaylen Brown, Kemba, Marcus Smart, Jimmy, Kendrick Nunn, Goran Dragic, Myles Turner, Malcolm Brogdon, Kyrie, KD, and Joel Embiid all miss  20% of the season (15 games) or more. That’s a lot of important guys from the East’s playoff picture and that’s not even mentioning what’s gonna happen next year when Toronto retools because that’s gonna be another set of stubborn motherfuckers if they don’t tear it down (which they 100% shouldn’t they have Nurse, FVV, and Siakam)  Props to McMillan and I think he’s earned an extension in Atlanta, I just don’t wanna see this team rest on their laurels by saying “hey, we broke in to the 5 seed” because when you put it into context against the rest of the East it’s a pretty tight arms race up for the end of the “contending in the East” tier"
"**Post Up is only one type of post scoring**.  That is not a measurement of all post scoring.    Let’s start with your 3 year lie.   &gt; But for the past 3 years Joel and Giannis has left him in the dust.  Towns came back and played through a wrist injury in a cast this year.  He then got Covid and played through recovering from lung breathing issues after having 7 family members die including his mother.  We are going to use the 3 years of his before this one.   The [3 years before](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/townska01.html#2018-2020-sum:per_game) this one Towns took 4.7 3PA a game out of 16.0 FGAs a game and had a .635 TS%.  That’s a .615 TS% on 3s and a .643 TS% on 2s.  Embiid had a .606 TS% in the last 3 years compared to Towns .635 TS%.   [In that time Towns](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/townska01.html#2018-2020-sum:shooting) took 56.5% of his shots within 10 feet (high post or low post) compared to [Embiid taking 49.1% of his shots](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html#2019-2021-sum:advanced) within 10 feet.    Here’s the big difference     Towns had a .728 FG% 0-3 feet to Embiid’s .730 FG% from 3, but Towns is much better at getting that shot.  Towns takes 32% of his FGA from 0-3 feet while Embiid only takes 28.1% of his shots that close because Embiid can’t create his shot at the rim as consistently as Towns can.    Embiid is better at post ups, Towns is better at post scoring.  I don’t care how you parse post scoring, Towns can face up Embiid or anyone else and drive and dunk on them better than anyone.  He has more versatility in his post scoring.   The Wolves have a winning record with Towns and D’Lo on the floor together and went 10-7 in Towns last 17 games.  We are doing just fine on winning and will do even better when Beasley is back as well and we have a solid starting PF.    And you are now less ignorant because you understand the difference between post up and post scoring."
"I mean true we cant assume he'd be worse or better than draymond  But I think its fair to assume hes probably worse than Danny Green, Seth Curry, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid right?  Becauze those are the guys whos shots he'd be taking"
"Homer pick, but Joel Embiid is the best two-way player in the NBA right now. Unstoppable on one end, amazing paint protection while not being able to be hunted relentlessly in pick and rolls on the other."
Joel Embiid. Looks great defensively and his midrange game is automatic like AD's last playoffs. Man is locked in right now and he's genuinely unguardable. Appeared comfortable navigating double teams as well.
Joel Embiid
"&gt; Towns was injured when we sucked. We didn’t suck in the 2nd half when Towns was healthy. &gt;’Lo, Beasley, and Ant were better offensively than your backcourt after Towns came back from injury. McDaniels shot 36.4% from 3 at SF/PF and only Vanderbilt at PF couldn’t shoot in our starting lineup.  &gt;The Wolves were a much better team after Towns came back from injury.  You were an abysmal 17-31 when he came back, but go off.  [For all that cherry picking it still doesn't translate to Ws](https://www.landofbasketball.com/games_between/joel_embiid_vs_karl_anthony_towns.htm), goddamn Tony Snell just made the 50/50/100 club but at least he's in the playoffs.    Sure, Towns IS better than Embiid as far as career percentages go, almost as if Embiid didn't play his first 2 seasons but you know good for KAT. [But for the past 3 years Joel and Giannis has left him in the dust](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/playtype-post-up/?SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=POSS_PCT&amp;dir=1). Give it time and that will change sooner rather than later.  With all these stats you want to incorporate, just a simple eye-test really. When was Towns ever in serious MVP discussion? When people talk about a post-scorer, does KAT ever get mentioned even? If you want more stats, All-NBA he had 1 as third team back in 18-19, Joel has double already and in a higher spot, same goes for All-Star but as a starter on all 4 instead of bench warmer.   KAT has peaked in 18-19 and you're not ready to have that conversation yet boyo. Every scapegoat KAT and the wolves franchise/fans have used are doing way better now, Jimmy, Wiggins, Thibs, Taj, Lavine and when you're over the honeymoon phase you'll ship Ant for some dumb reason yet again, like a bonafide stan.  Maybe your center should focus on efficient winning, ever thought of that."
"I don't really understand this take. He's not Joel Embiid or Pau Gasol. He's more like Dirk but with great defense and hops.   Dirk never played deep in the post back to the basket hitting shimmies and shakes. But he killed you from 8-10 feet.   Davis did just that last year, shooting ridiculously from Mid Range.   But he can also run the Pick and Roll and dunk on guys or get ally oops.   He does have good touch around the rim IF he gets into position but that's the thing everyone rightfully gets so mad about. He occasionally plays like he's 5""10 not 6""10 and gets literally zero rebounds.   Then some days he's like prime Dwight on the offensive boards PLUS he has a soft touch or dunks on guys.   I really think after LeBron hangs em up the Lakers should trade Davis because even after all this time he has not developed the attitude that's required to solo-carry a franchise like the Lakers and Laker fans are going to kill him for it."
"I'm Joel Embiid, yes"
"The 3rd foul on Embiid, Len jumped in the air and fell on his face next to Joel. Horrible call that made Doc sit Joel for 7 minutes remaining in the first half. One of a  few questionable calls today."
"Harden is just about tied with Luka, while Dame rounds out my Top Ten.  Book is right around that range, too.  1. LeBron James 1. Stephen Curry 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. Kevin Durant 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Luka Dončić 1. James Harden 1. Nikola Jokić 1. Joel Embiid 1. Damian Lillard"
Hey beyond the arc means from three. I think you mean from the line. Also you guys just dont have GROWN MEN to defend Embiid. Joel has the ADULT SOUL of a FATHER that these LITTLE BOYS can't comprehend
"the Robin Lopez isos can be ugly but with a Scott Brooks' half court offense generally speaking it's been the best play for weeks now lol  &gt; Among NBA players with at least 100 post-ups this season, Lopez has been the most efficient, according to Synergy Sports. More than Vucevic. More than Joel Embiid. More than Nikola Jokic. Entering play Sunday, the Wizards were scoring 122.9 points per 100 possessions on plays that end in his shots, turnovers or passes out of the post, putting him well atop the league.  ^^ From 4/26 Athletic [article](https://theathletic.com/2542845/2021/04/26/the-hookman-mild-mannered-robin-lopez-has-become-a-wizards-low-post-superhero/)"
Half the assists were dimes to moving spot up shots.  He doesn’t get assists for dumping it to Embiid often because Joel takes so much time working downlow before shooting.
Joel embiid and doc rivers do not go well In big games lol
"Wizards can score and they had tons of covid shit early. Their second half of the season is better than an 8th seed. That being said, the foul bullshit and not using embiid half the game is definitely making this closer than it should be. Joel is +21 in 28 mins"
"The Philadelphia 76ers are good when Joel Embiid is on the court, it turns out"
"I would have thought Joel Embiid would be feasting today, but Washington's frontcourt seems to be keeping up on both sides of the ball."
Joel Embiid the DPOY 😂
"1st seed sixers vs 8 (bottom of playoff) seed Wizards  Joel Embiid, the starting Sixer center who has been m questionable foul trouble, was a front runner for MVP this season before an injury and is now solidly 2nd and won’t win it   Enjoy the game, brother. Basketball is very fun to watch cus there’s so few players and you can get to really know their play"
Remember [that time](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theathletic.com/2338267/2021/01/22/a-celtics-fans-guide-to-being-mad-about-joel-embiid-free-throw-machine/%3famp) that a Celtics beat writer reviewed every foul called on Jo and determined he should have received more than he did?
I like Simmons but the only way the Sixers are ever going to win a title with Embiid as the center piece is to trade Ben for a star wing that can be paired with Joel  Ben is a good option to trade because he's so valuable and teams would be actually willing to give up something to get him
"Tobias ""Joel Embiid"" Harris"
Congrats to Alex Len on becoming the new Joel Embiid
When u study for Joel Embiid but got J. Cole on the test
"If I saw a sign saying ""Welcome to Comcast Country"" I'm pulling a Joel Embiid and doing a 180."
"am i tripping or did marv albert just say ""joel embiid played by danny green"", while joel embiid was posting up alex len. lol"
“Looks like Shaq in ‘01 against Dikembe” is something no human should say when Joel Embiid backs down Alex Len
"Perchance throwing Len at Embiid first to use up Len's 6 fouls is a better option than throwing your best option on him from tip-off, no? If Gafford can't not foul he's gonna be sitting down in 10 minutes going up against Joel ""Sweep the arms!"" Embiid."
Hurr during I'm going to throw Alex len at Joel Embiid because I'm incompetent hurr durr
I assure you that being a “big body” is not “all that matters” when your defensive assignment is Joel Embiid.
"&gt; he got gentleman swept by the same team Embiid just took to 7 games in the previous round(context matters)  So, after I showed you how Embiid was clearly worse against the Raptors than Giannis, your response still includes ""**Embiid** took them to 7.""  Not the Sixers, Embiid. Yep, that sub-20 PPG on sub-40% shooting for a big man first option is what took the Raptors to seven games, because apparently basketball is no longer a team sport, and reality no longer matters.  Not like, you know, one team might have had Jimmy Butler as their ""third star"" that year, while the other team had to try to rely on Eric ""literally forgets how to play basketball the moment the regular season ends"" Bledsoe.  Nope, clearly the difference in the length of the series against Toronto must have been Joel Embiid doing so much better than Giannis (even though, again, I already showed he definitely wasn't even close.)"
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he’s around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I’m missing who you rate over Nurk?"
"What? The problem with having a center as your best player is usually that they're simply not good enough offensively (e.g. Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid). Jokic *is* good enough. His defence is the problem."
"There may be at least somewhat of an argument vs. Harden, but I personally would need to see Embiid lead a team on a deep playoff run first, he’s yet to really do anything in the playoffs. I know Harden hasn’t had ultimate success there either but the West is much tougher and he’s also been consistently great for longer than Embiid.  As for Durant, there is zero evidence that Joel Embiid is a better player than Kevin Durant. Zero. It’s hardly even a discussion yet, and very well may never be. This is one of the greatest all-time talents the league has ever seen."
Jimmy G gets removed from the quarterback position and takes his place as a villain in the world by tossing Joel Embiid at a herd of wildebeests. That’s some real misplaced anger at Robert Kraft and the 49ers
If Luka gave that power to Joel Embiid.. :(
"It's a long shot, but he absolutely has the physical tools. Dude has the same wingspan as Joel Embiid and a 40-inch vert."
Captain hook &gt; Joel Embiid
"Dwight confirms Joel Embiid was “a little Simba” in the regular season, believes he should start over Embiid"
"I respect your opinion but definitely disagree. Sure it would be better for college hoops if A-list players still wanted to play 4 years, but I think the sport is still intriguing and fun to watch even with a couple of the big powers (Duke and Kentucky primarily) being 1&amp;Done factories. I would certainly disagree that the NCAA hasn’t been “relevant” in decades, I’d say as recently as 2019 with Zion the NCAA was immensely relevant. Duke was all over SportsCenter and everywhere else. Plenty of good college teams are still built on the backs of numerous 4-year players. This year’s champ, Baylor, was an absolutely incredible squad that shot over 40% from deep *as a team* and featured 6 upperclassmen among their most prominent ~8 players, and no freshmen. I personally am a Kansas fan and though we’ve sent some 1&amp;Dones to the league (Josh Selby, Xavier Henry, Ben McLemore, Andrew Wiggins, Joel Embiid, Kelly Oubre, Josh Jackson come to mind), most of our actual best players over that time frame have been 3-4 year guys like Sherron Collins, Cole Aldrich, Thomas Robinson, Tyshawn Taylor, Perry Ellis, Devonte’ Graham, and Frank Mason. Idk, it probably helps that I grew up a fan of a blue blood, but I love college hoops. I think if anything, what threatens the quality of the sport long-term is the newly relaxed transfer rules. I also have a hard time knocking them though because the kids deserve flexibility, but that will definitely threaten team continuity more than the 1&amp;Done trend."
"Could always join the 76ers ragefest, we especially hate LeBron right now because his crybaby ass intentionally injured Joel Embiid over getting posterized and that's the injury that derailed his MVP campaign."
"Flagrant doesn't require a windup. Its usually always a flagrant if there is a windup.  I feel like you have issue with understanding simple logic like this, which is concerning if you actually graduated with a STEM degree.  &gt; Unnecessary contact would be LeBron James two-hand shoving Joel Embiid in mid-air.  But two hands to the face, knocking LeBron off-balance mid-air, with no play on the ball is ok? I'll remind you intent to make a play on the ball and making a play on the ball are two different things, and intent is again not required for a flagrant."
"I agree it's not an argument. That's why it wasn't ruled a flagrant foul. Draymond made a snap decision to prevent James from getting an easy layup/dunk and there happened to be contact on the head. There was no wind-up or shove. No, Green wasn't completely vertical, but when someone is coming into you the body's natural tendency is to curl forward. It's unfortunate that there was contact to James head but it wasn't a flagrant.  Unnecessary contact would be LeBron James two-hand shoving Joel Embiid in mid-air."
"If you think that Westbrook, Lillard, or Kyrie are anywhere near better, ESPECIALLY Westbrook, than Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, or Giannis Antetokounmpo than you do not understand the sport of basketball. Westbrook rn is barely a top 30 player, let alone top 5. Idk if you are living in 2017 or just favor star guards but its blasphemous to even think Westbrook is a third of a player Jokic is."

He’s an Offensive 4 and a defensive rim protector/drop back. I’ve watched Porziņģis for 4 years his fit/position isn’t as clear as someone like Joel Embiid who is 100% center.

"BREAKING: Lil' Stevie Adams speaks out as a Philadelphia court decides neither of his parents, [Joel Embiid &amp; Russell Westbrook](https://nothingbutnylon.com/joel-embiid-russell-westbrook-steven-adams/), who have been in the midst of a nasty divorce for four years, will have custody of the child.  You want in-depth, hard-hitting, child-exploiting journalism, and Raymond Tortuga delivers it [time and time again](https://nothingbutnylon.com/topic/satire/)."
Depends on if Joel embiid shows up. Look at how bad the rest of the team played last year when they lost in the 1st round. He was the only one showing some effort while the rest of the team gave up
"James Harden and Joel embiid,    Russell Westbrook/giannis"
Joel Embiid 2021
"He wasn't relegated to being the fourth option. He was the fourth option because the first three were:  Joel Embiid  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  I am obviously a huge Ben fan but I want all of those players taking shots before Ben unless it's in transition or there is a mismatch in the post.   I am not worried because I watch every Sixers game and have seen the difference between how he's used this season and last. Idk if it's Ben being more willing to do the little things or just Docs coaching and schemes but he has been incredibly useful on offense, while shooting less frequently than ever.   So if we lose to the Bucks or Nets or whatever I am almost certainly not gonna blame the guy that averages (at least not only him) 14-15ppg for averaging 10-12ppg. If he's turning the ball over or getting roasted on the other end, or not pushing the pace then that's one thing. That's what he does for this team. But him not being a jumpshooter doesn't matter to the current iteration of the Sixers. They know he can't and that's why it isn't important for him to score in our offense.   The example you used is really my point exactly. The Bucks depended on MVP Giannis to score 25+ a game. He is their superstar number one option. His deficiencies caused him to not score efficiently or at his normal numbers. That hurt the team. Simmons isn't our primary or secondary scorer, he's our primary facilitator. He needs to be able to do that and a lack of a jumper is not likely to hinder that ability since it hasn't all season. The regular season does matter I'm sorry it does. It's not the playoffs but it is important.   And I know you might want to say that his limitations will hurt Embiid, but trust me they won't. Doc knows how to use Ben to make Embiid's life easier and he's been doing so all year. The playoffs won't change the fact that you can't just leave Ben wide open in the dunker's spot or when he cuts to the rim.   So no, I'm not worried about that. I have concerns, but not that Ben won't be able to score enough for us to win, because that's not typically how we win anyway."
"That would probably be the first game all season that that's happened. There is no way any team, even the ones with good defenses or the the ones that double Embiid well (those aren't the same defenses lol) can force Ben to shoot more than Embiid. Absolutely no path to make that happen.   The only way that would happen is if you double Embiid when he's facing up with Ben's man, and then when Ben cuts to the basket you literally just don't guard him or send anyone. You just hope he misses a wide open dunk for some reason. Then Ben will shoot more than Embiid but he'd also have like 45 points so is it really worth it?   If you send a man to cover Ben diving to the basket then Joel passes to the man he vacated and then they are in a scramble and eventually it's a wife open three usually from the corner or a drive right past a closeout to the rim. Ben doesn't even need to touch the ball for this to happen, just cut. And he's been doing it all season long.   But I want to reiterate, short of having six or seven men on the court, there's no way a team is able to force Ben to shoot more than Joel. He doesn't even shoot more than Harris."
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
ima be honest it depends on what aspect of the game youre talking about.  Scoring Joel is better in a lot of advanced statistics.  Defense Joel is better in every single statistic.  Efficiency Jokic is better.  Rebounding and Physicality stats Embiid wins out.  Im not a Jokic hater and im fine with him winning MVP so dont take my homerism to serious eventho i believe when both are playing you want Embiid on your team.

"Tell me lol. Look at this statement from Zach Lowe from this year ROY against 2016-2017 ROY.

"Presumably Jokic-Steph-Joel, as great as Embiid was he still sat out nearly a third of the season."
JOEL EMBIID?!?!?!
"Gobert. No doubt. Who says he can't guard 1-5? This man literally guards an entire team just by being in the paint. Basketball is a team sport and with Utah's scheme of funnelling guards and wings to Gobert just shows how important this man is to what they do.   Some guards and wings don't even attack the rim like they usually do when they Gobert is in the paint. His presence alone can stifle the offense of any team.  Sure, Simmons can keep up with wings and bigs, but having a guy like Joel Embiid as his last line of defense hurts his case."
Shaq has literally claimed that Embiid is more talented than he was at his peak. Dude loves Joel
A Joel embiid who's pissed off he didn't get mvp
Yeah if I’m Russell Westbrook I want to have to play against Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on defense instead of Kyrie Irving and Blake Griffin
Great game! Your prize is Joel Embiid
"No awards show according to the ESPN article  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31479904/nikola-jokic-stephen-curry-joel-embiid-named-finalists-nba-mvp-award  &gt;The NBA is reverting to its longtime tradition this year and announcing the various award winners during the playoffs, as opposed to the recently created end-of-season awards show.

"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
"I imagine every team. The most roster turnover I've seen was from the Process 76ers and they still had Thaddeus Young &gt; MCW &gt; Joel Embiid, that I can think of off the top of my head."
"sites great, but I got a bug connecting Moses Malone to Joel Embiid  https://imgur.com/a/ZkCrZQ7 these are two different Mark Joneses lol"
Joel Embiid 29.5  John Collins 4.1  Giannis 27.5  Jrue 26.1  Doncic 8  $95.2M
Let me run   Steph- 43  ANT-9.7  Luka- 8  Tatum- 9.8  Joel Embiid- 29.5
"Bruh in 10-20 years I doubt anyone will still use that against him unless he gets a job on Inside the NBA and Joel Embiid, who seems to be a lock for Inside after he retires, always clowns on KD during the show for the superteams he’s been on. Other than that I don’t see that being used against him forvever."
I don’t know if him getting more gassed playing the 5 is actually true against certain teams like the warriors. It’s not like Joel embiid or nikola jokic is on the other side this game and either way he would probably still be guarding Draymond (either because Draymond is the 5 or because they put the the power forward on looney).
Lebron is great but it is painful to watch how biased the officiating is in his favour in meaningful games.  He can straight up shoulder charge guys driving into the lane and on the other end will flop egregiously and draw charges.  Not to mention the constant sidebar discussions he has with the refs and getting away with incredibly dangerous plays like his pushes on Shaun Livingston and Joel Embiid.
difference between that and the embiid play is draymond was trying to make a play on the ball.  Lebron just pushed joel in the mid section
"No, I didnt get into the nitty gritty. What is that like 25MM per season....for a BIG WHO CANT SHOOT 3s, stretch the floor or even have much of a midrange game? This isn't 1990 or 2000, of which that portion of the cap is warranted. Allen is a good big, a starter, but not a superstar. He's like a younger, harder working version of Deandre Jordan, imo you dont give 25MM to that type of player the way the league is trending. You give that money to a Joel Embiid type player who is elite defensively/offensively, and who can stretch the floor"
"Jimmy was not more important than Joel Embiid in any series ever. You mentioned Embiid struggling against *double teams* in your previous post, which in itself would indicate that Embiid was the Raptor's focal point. Of our offense and our defense. When he wasn't on the court we couldn't defend shit and couldn't score.   Jimmy had a couple great games in that Raptors series but so did Jamal Murray against the Clippers in the bubble. But that does not mean Jokic was not the most important player on that Nuggets team last season."
&gt;People value games played very highly for these awards for some reason.  Is Joel Embiid your MVP?
"You don't think Joel Embiid would be a better fit lmao come on now. We are saying ideal, not ""economically a solid fit"". Looney is very good in his role, not saying otherwise."
"Man I thought he could've won it. I know this is the rookie ladder, whatever. Lamelo missed 21 games. You know who else missed that amount of time? Joel Embiid. But he isn't gonna win mvp because of time played. Idk why the same logic doesn't apply here, especially with how ants played"
&gt; Forward: Joel Embiid      w8 wtf lmao

"dude i would feel way worse about losing in the second round to new york or atlanta (assuming we’re fully healthy) than the kawhi shot or last year. the kawhi shot would be different if we had been up 1, but given it was tied, i still think we’d lose in OT. team was running on fumes by the end and kawhi was superhuman. last year as soon as ben got hurt we lost whatever small chance we previously had of beating a team in the first round  if embiid is health this year and we can’t beat the knicks or hawks with home court advantage we’ve gotta basically tear it apart around Joel"
I’m not sure whether I want the wizards to just put me out of my misery on Thursday because I don’t know if I want to watch Alex Len attempt to play defense on Joel Embiid for 4 games
Honestly it was only 3 years of tanking because Joel got hurt. Had Embiid played the year he was drafted the team would have been a lot better and more exciting to go see.
wild joel embiid as a forward sighting
1. Nikola Jokić 2. Joel Embiid 3. Giannis Antetokounmpo 4. Steph Curry  5. Cp3/Julius Randle
"Lmfao ""losing culture,"" what are you 50? It's funny how that losing culture stopped as soon as Joel Embiid, two way superstar, started playing games for us 🤔"
It isn’t that bad... if Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons weren’t already on the team...
"Giannis, Joel Embiid, Steph Curry   Gobert, Chris Paul  Can all have a case for 1 1st place vote or MVP."
"Some of the moves they got tons of shit for at the time look great in retrospect, like trading Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Willams while they were still positive assets. Hell, they got flak for ""drafting an injured player"" in Joel Embiid."
"here, if you were to Google “simmons embiid  fit” you’ll find tons of articles responding to those takes.   [here’s a vice article ](https://www.vice.com/en/article/439jap/the-problem-with-ben-simmons-and-joel-embiid-in-one-play) just for good measure"
You mean like Joel Embiid (who played) and let me check... Uh Danny Green?
"Joel ""don't compare me to Ayton because I play defense"" Embiid in shambles."
Joel Embiid
Reminds me of Joel Embiid windmilling neighborhood kids  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSGcp9MmsOY
"I hear you going hard for your mans, but Ayton isn’t carrying the team night after night like Joel or joker.  Joker was his entire team and they won a playoff series on him balling out every night.  Embiid starts 2/3 of the sixers possessions.  Ayton is awesome, but he isn’t a focal point superstar the way those guys are even if he’s really really great."
No  What tells you that KAT is a better offensive player than Embiid? Joel averaged 28/10 on a 1st seed. KAT averaged 24/10 on a 13th seed  Embiid is miles ahead of him defensively too
Between him and [John Collins’ shirt](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/21/john-collins-wears-shirt-of-him-dunking-on-joel-embiid-to-press-conference/amp/) the league is going in the right direction fashion wise
"Facts, lookin like Joel Embiid with that quote"
Lmfaooo blatche was playing like Joel fucking Embiid next to the og Philippine team though
A public example is Joel Embiid. He got called out by Shaq last year I think and was told he had to be more dominant especially in the paint and Embiid owned up to it and he had an MVP caliber season this season and more than likely would’ve won MVP if he didn’t miss so many games. Probably the best example in recent memory.
You guys should tank to draft a player like... Joel Embiid?
Annual second lottery... Winner gets to pick the rule change... It'd be wild!  Oh that was the year all shooting fouls we're 3 free throws and Joel Embiid averaged 44 points.  That was the year you couldn't foul out and drives to the paint got frightening.  That was the year we played first team to 115 wins.  That was the year they had the 4 point spot and it didn't matter cuz nobody used it lol.
"He absolutely improved it this season [(relevant Fivethirtyeight article)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joel-embiid-changed-his-offseason-conditioning-now-hes-playing-like-an-mvp/), which is part of why he was an early MVP contender before the injuries took him out for the remainder of the season.  It's just that with conditioning in particular if you're nursing an injury/playing on an injury it really messes up a lot of what you work for."
Imagine Tobias Harris having a higher salary than Joel Embiid.
"Sixers fans immediately after they lost to the Hawks - ""all we need is a league average point guard to replace Simmons!""                                     One, Simmons helps you win in the regular season, that's already proven. High seeding helps you avoid difficult matchups in the post season. Simply removing Simmons from the equation won't change anything, you're being ousted in the first round....you know, like what happened last season when Ben missed the playoffs entirely even though Joel averaged 30+ for the series....the team still got swept. As much as the Simmons hate commentary will get you karma, it still misses the point of his value.                  You need to get something much more than a league average point guard. Who is that anyway? Schroeder? Would he move the needle enough to get the team a championship? No a chance in hell. What they're also ignoring and what is truly the elephant in the room for the franchise, something none of their fans want to admit, is Embiid's long and constant injury history. What happens when he's on the bench recovering from his latest ailment? Who is going to step up? You think Tobi + 'league average PG' is going to get you wins when Joel isn't playing? Again, no chance in hell.             What they really need is another superstar to help take the load off Embiid and carry the team when he's off the floor, because he's going to be off the floor *a lot,* as he has been his entire career. So the least you want is Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum aint gonna be that guy, but in reality you're looking for another top ten player and the only way you're getting that is if someone demands a trade because after the Hawks series nobody is going to consider a Simmons centric trade for their franchise player. They will hang up very quickly but not before laughing very loudly in your ear.             Going back to Beal, you honestly thing the Wizards are going to want to pair Simmons with Westbrook? That could be the most ill fitting All Star pairing in the entire league. Washington are going to want a lot more than just Ben, they will demand young talent in the form of a Maxey or Thybulle. Sixers will balk at that. But at least an Embiid-Beal pairing would give them a much better chance of competing for championships though would you even put them above the Bucks? A healthy Nets team is going to obliterate them....and that's without knowing what changes the Nets will be making next season, what holes they are going to try and fill. Honestly, this was *the* best chance for the Sixers to go all the way, it's almost comical how many obstacles were removed from their path - Lakers and Nets being the biggest ones, both taken out of the equation...but they blew it and may never have a chance again given the Nets might just be at the beginning of a multi year dynasty."
"If your center is called Joel Embiid, sure  There are a lot more that goes into backing someone down in the post than just size/height.   We've already seen examples like Tingus Pingis being 7'3 but can't back anyone down for shit, or Gobert who is 7'1 but has no moves at all on the post to punish the Clippers putting 6'8 Batum on him"
"If we’re talking strictly injuries? Maybe Greg oden, penny hardaway, or even Joel embiid.  If work ethic and shit mattered? Kobe hands down lol"
Like what Joel Embiid does. Granted Joel isn't afraid to shoot or dunk or fear getting fouled
Unless you pull a Joel embiid and just dive at his knees I’d say no

What about if they made moves for this starting 5:  PG: Damian Lillard  SG: James Harden  SF: Lebron James  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Joel Embiid  Would this be a good team?
"I absolutely agree. I’m a baseball fan and umps miss calls but the thing is there’s *consistency*.  Umpires are actually scored both on if the ball was technically a strike *and* if thats how they’ve been calling it all game (“established zone”).  People fuck up but when the LEague has just decided as a while that Trae Young and Joel Embiid will get certain calls that wont happen if that person’s name isn’t Trae Young or Embiid, or that if you’re large you’re just allowed to be mauled (shocker the game has become a smaller player based league) its fucking asinine and is one of the things that makes it hard for me to become a hardcore NBA fan.  Calls get missed in the NFL, but i guarantee that if you show the same play to a bunch of refs, 90% of the time it will always be the same. NBA you could show a play and not tell the refs what was called and they might have a 50-50 chance of making the same call as on the floor."
"Michael Carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Evan Turner, Joel Embiid....   God this team's drafting was not great under Hinkie."
Deandre Ayton &gt; Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid 🔥
"I’m not sold on anybody on your roster not named Joel embiid. Ben Simmons is done dude, stick a fork in him, are you old enough to remember nick Anderson my nephew. Go back and look at those missed free throws and look how it affected his career after. Simmons is junk at this point. You guys rolled out to money for Tobias Harris and sometimes he looks good but he’s not gonna crack more than 20 pt avg the rest of his career. Nobody wants to play for Daryl morrey after that fiasco in Houston anymore.  You had a Chance at James harden but wanted to keep Simmons? Why hasn’t shake Milton blown up yet btw. Isn’t he suppose to be your best player off to bench.  Dude I’m sorry to tell you but embiid ain’t sticking around, he’s gonna leave just watch.   Best thing to do is trade Simmons and parts for CJ from Portland"
"Everything is not getting blown up in philly. There will be changes made no doubt but if you think that coming off a number 1 seed in the east, with a president in his first year, a coach in his first year, I top 5 player, and multiple all stars, they're going to go from being the #1 seed to blowing it up, you do not know basketball. Yes it was a disappointing season but from your viewpoint, Brooklyn should blow it up, Denver should blow it up, and almost every team outside of the final 4 should blow it up. This isn't 2k son. I am living in reality, you just are a reactionist that have no clue what you are talking about. There will be some changes around him but Joel Embiid will be the starting center of the Philadelphia 76ers opening day of the 2021-22 season."
"I was so relieved when the Bucks drafted Jabari Parker over Joel Embiid. I was sure Embiid would always be limited by injuries, and knew Parker would shine."
Saying Hassan Whiteside was better than Joel Embiid
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"He gives up a couple of inches and like 40ish pounds to most NBA centers which isn't terrible, sure, but its bound to tire him out and make things harder for him on the glass especially if he has to guard a joel embiid. Also, the 5 makes it harder for him to switch, as KD would be his only teammate with the height or length to keep up with other centers on rolls to the rim. If you don't want to call him a liability that's fine but his biggest strength is guarding all positions, at the 5 guarding all of them becomes tricky, so it limits his biggest defensive strength."
I just won the finals on philly as a shooting guard (5 min quarters cus fuck playing for more than 15 min imo) but on like 15 min I put up 40 pts on 56% shooting and joel embiid got finals mvp for scoring 10 and 9 a game. ????????  i hate 2k and I only had 4 1000vc offers from garbage teams.  pain
"I read ""Sixers star Joel Embiid breaks"" and said to myself ""oh fuck what happened this time"""
"""Sixers star Joel Embiid breaks..."""
"Right on. I think most 180 pound small starting guards have high stamina; it’s just that we see Trae with the ball in his hands so much that we tend to think he’s superhuman.   Also, he’s not a huge “sweater” like Patrick Ewing or Joel Embiid where we see sweat glistening off their foreheads 5 minutes in to a game. Haha"
"Well, that's the paradox of guarding Trae Young and why they run a pnr heavy offense. They want you to hedge the screen or switch the screen. They want the mismatched defenders on Young &amp; Capela.   Trae Young is as good of a player in the pnr as I've ever seen, always seems to make the right decision with the lob/floater and he's too good of a shooter to go under screens.  I think a fully healthy Embiid + a less offensively burdened Embiid which allows him to exert more effort on defense would've helped. Joel wasn't really contesting the lob as much as he can and it was probably a combination of having to carry the whole offensive load and his meniscus. But if you can't defend the lob against them it's bbq chicken"
"Well you forgot a key fact that Runner up MVP Joel Embiid was playing with a torn meniscus, while having a shitty series for his standards. And kawhi statistically had one of the greatest playoff series of all time. The sixers had Ben Simmons who averaged 10 fucking points while Clippers had PG who averaged 24/9/6."
The Hawks literally just beat runner up MVP Joel Embiid - the first team in the East. Beating weak ass Knicks is irrelevant.
"&gt;Teams have been using the Chicago pre-draft camp to gauge the Sixers' interest in trade packages, sources said, although Philadelphia remains reluctant to break up the tandem of Joel Embiid and Simmons without maximizing a return and exhausting all possibilities to improve Simmons' offense, sources said."
"The Raptors maybe. I mean,   1) To start they lost to the Magic, who then went back to being the Magic(no offense) with Vucevic, Fournier, and Ross all dipping below 38%.   2) Then Joel Embiid was battling injuries in the second round, capped off by arguably the luckiest shot of the playoffs.   3) Giannis had them down 2-0, and then Kawhi said “hell nah” and led them to 4 straight wins.   4) They also had real luck with getting Nick Nurse over Dwayne Casey, as well as Danny Green and trading for Marc Gasol after Memphis held on to him for too long."
Ok and Joel Embiid is hurt as well
My sauces tell me Joel Embiid will welcome Russ with open arms.
"Shaqtin: Here’s Joel Embiid still trying to PROCESS this pass attempt.  Shaq, I see what you did there."
"I don’t know, man. The Hawks don’t have the defensive personnel to stop ~~Julius Randle~~ ~~Joel Embiid~~ Giannis, and the ~~Knicks~~ ~~Sixers~~ Bucks have a lot of long defenders that will slow down Trae’s scoring and take away his passing lanes. Trae Young will get targeted on the defensive end and there’s just no way that the Hawks can score enough to make up for that. The Hawks should be proud that they made the ~~playoffs~~ ~~second round~~ conference finals after such a bad start to the season but this is as far as they’ll get"
"As a long suffering Hawks fan this series makes me so happy, even if we lose. So long as we don't get embarrassed and Trae goes off and wins a couple I'll be on cloud 9.  Of course, I said the same thing at the beginning of the Sixers series and by Game 7 I had a Joel Embiid voodoo doll."
Yeah that season only netted us Joel embiid (pretty big addition IMO). Also turned the Pelicans pick (from jrue trade) into Dario saric and getting our pick back from the magic. But sure dude your plan would have been better and pleased the basketball gods by building “the right way”
"Take all 3 of those guys, add in Dame and Joel Embiid and you have a true contender."
"The sixers didn’t lose because they took the best player in every draft.  They lost because they had 2 number 1 overall picks, 2 number 3 overall picks And came out with embiid, a borderline all star who can’t run a playoff offense, and 2 busts.   The process failed because of their shit scouting and player development. Not because of their philosophy.  If they took kristaps, brown, jamal, Fox tatum with those picks (really any number 2 other than Ben Simmons) to pair with Joel, they are probably on their way to the finals rn."
"Harder to find a good center than a good perimeter player.  &gt;unless you have a generational prospect like Joel Embiid.  Mobley isn't far off this. He's as good of a defensive big prospect as I've seen coming out of college, has elite mobility, and has great touch.   He could legitimately become a more mobile Gobert with an offensive game."
"Just to add on, he is not maybe the most versatile defender in the NBA, he actually is. BBall Index Defensive Versatility has him first this season in versatility + second highest for the stat, with his percentage guarding each position being as close to even as you can probably get, for reference they were;  &gt; PG: 21.1% &gt; SG: 17.8% &gt; SF: 18.4% &gt; PF: 27.1% &gt; C: 15.6%  A legit 1 through 5 defender who can defend your teams best defender to great success whether it be Luka through to Embiid.  &gt; Joel Embiid:  9/33 (27%) – 51% for the season &gt; Giannis Antetokounmpo:  27/54 (50%) – 58% for the season &gt; Damian Lillard:  15/37 (40%) – 44% for the season &gt; Luka Doncic:  4/11 (36%) – 48% for the season  OG should legit be in the DPOY conversation he is that good on D, forget about all-defence which he got robbed of last year because apparently we had too many good defenders (weird how that didn't apply to the Sixers this year or Bucks last year) or this year (not enough team success which is the opposite reason he was robbed last year)."
"I'm sorry but Joel Embiid wasn't shooting 3s early in his career either. Shooting can be developed with time, unless you are Ben Simmons of course."
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
"The year is 2030.  NBA Finals, game 7 in Philadelphia.  Joel Embiid has led his team to a win with a monster 42/15 and 4 blocks.  Confetti rains down as Embiid gleams with joy, his first championship.   He hoists the Larry O'Brien trophy and bellows, ""This one's for you Sac-Town!!!""  Kings 113 - 76ers 99.  Process successful."
"They already are in contention   They as the #1 seed who fell flat in their face because they lack someone with CJ skill set but are in contention as is.   And with him would keep or elevate their chances   You really try to focus on the exact minutae of words as opposed to the spirit of them.   CJ takes bad midrange shots. CJ doesn’t put Philly over the top.   Both supposed facts by you are categorically false. Yes the latter you can’t prove, no one can. But if you examine what the sixers need at CJs position, he is a fit. Which btw pushes them beyond contention. The purpose of team building is to develop fits.  For instance... Rudy gobert was exposed in part because his perimeter defenders are turnstiles. They don’t fit or mesh well together.  Also scheme, Rudy was going up against one of the best 3 pt shooting teams. No adjustments were made to have him guard anything but the corner man.   Joel Embiid and Ben don’t fit. Ben clogs the paint. Joel can’t effectively overcome Simmons shortcomings despite getting better at the perimeter.  Embiid can cover CJs shortcomings however. And CJs strengths play into embiids."
"Yeah, let's trade away our top-5 player who doesn't want out for a bunch of picks. Maybe one of those picks will turn into a Joel Embiid.  Simmons will get traded first. He still has value despite this terrible playoffs"
"Cavs will even have Evan mobley or Jalen Greene at #3. Personally I think J. Green has potential to be next Kobe type talent. Shot 37% 3pt w crazy step backs and hes got mad hops and 1st step. ? About Def end and his skinny frame but hes 6 ft 6in 180 lbs. He can put on 20 lbs of muscle over next 2 yrs. Hes only 19 yrs old. Hes still growing. Evan Mobley is best big in class and compared to AD. Hes gonna be a beast. He needs to fill out his body too. Put on muscle. But he can develop a 3 pt shot and better footwork in post. His def is there already.  I believe Hou takes Jalen Green at #2 bc they got Christian Wood who has a similar game.   If that indeed happens. CLE needs to keep that pick and run it to commissioner with no hesitation. Truth is bigs arent coveted as much in this modern NBA. U see mobley being a better Jaren Jackson jr in mem and potential to be like AD in lal.   CLE would then have D Garland, C Sexton, I Okorro, E Mobley, and J Allen. As potential starting 5. Mobley could play the 5 when teams go small. He showed great Def vs smalls in ncaa and closing out on 3 pters.   Evan Mobley at #3 is a steal and I think CLE will stay put if Houston doesn't take Mobley bs they got C wood.  Ppl see upside of Jalen Green as next superstar. When u watch him on tape u see hes best OFF player and mad hops. His hops are Z lavine like and got quick 1st step. The ? Is Defense motor and putting on more muscle.  He shot 37% from 3pt land on hard step back type shots. Guy is a highlight film. Hes got pogo stick hops. Its scary.  Bc hes got step back 3 already and his game is evolving.  He needs to work on passing and facilitating. If Hou picks E mobley #2 , CLE would draft J Green and possibly  look to move sexton. Maybe pkg him w K Love could land CLE a superstar. If CLE just stays put. They could have D GARLAND.. C Sexton.. Jalen Green.. Isaac Okoro.. L Nance Jr.. and J..Allen..   If they cant get Sexton to take less than Max then you trade him this year along w K Love.  Ben Simmons could be in play. Adding K love and C Sexton to Joel embiid could work for both teams.   Playing Ben Simmons at #4 using him as a pick n roller. Rather than ball handling.. simmons can guard 1 - 5 and switch. D GARLAND, J GREEN, I OKORO, B. SIMMONS, J. ALLEN WOULD BE DYNAMITE. WITH L NANCE JR AND CEEDI AND T PRINCE ..   I think CLE is going to have alot of options now...  And staying put and taking whoever falls im their lap may be their best move. Unless they.trade up to go get cade cunninham. If Det aint sold on.#1 or like J green or J suggs or mobley better.. they could trade down..   Look at Fultz and Tatum from a few years ago..   Alot of options CLE is going to have!!   Lucky we lost that coin toss to OKC lol."
"&gt;	Anytime the Warriors were in trouble, they force fed Durant in the playoffs.   Ya especially when in 2016 Curry with a fucked knee cooked Durant alive head to head in their respective primes while Durant was saddled with an all time creator in Westbrook. They force fed Durant “in 2016” so much that he averaged a turnover per assist while shooting a paltry 54 TS%.   Then Durant proceeded to **join** the team that just won 73 games after losing to lebron in. But let’s get back to your narrative that the warriors fed Durant the ball during the playoffs. Well, you certainly don’t mean **creation** or **playmaking** because by touches, passes completed, dribbles per possession, Durant was third behind Curry and Draymond. Why? Because he turns the ball over as much as joel embiid when asked to be the primary ball handler.   &gt;	Durants like the 2nd best postseason scorer In League history.  Lmfao once he joined a 73 win team with the league mvp after getting role player defensive attention he somehow fulfilled this criteria for you?   &gt;	I don’t care that Kd got 2 open dunks in the  You don’t care about context? Well, if we don’t need context then you’d likely agree that Giannis just outdueled Durant head to head with a shit coach and shooters. No context needed.  Those “”””open dunks”””” are backed by Curry’s juggernaut offensive abilities found in every single advanced stat imaginable. You think Durant really was able to take his OKC days (being a turnover machine and shooting awfully) and then he joins a 73 team and he somehow develops the ability to score 10% points higher?  You’re in denial bro"
"Every non-homer: Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid can't work together  Sixers front office/coaching: Yes they can  [They can't, entire Sixers front office gets shaken up and coaching replaced]  Every non-homer: Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid cannot work together.  New Sixers management: Yes they can, just watch.  [They can't, again.]  New Sixers management: Well this is embarrassing.  The worst part is any casual fan was able to see this yet it eludes the Sixers organization."
"I've been seeing a disturbing amount of Sixers fans online ask if a Lillard-Simmons trade would be possible.     To answer your question, no, absolutely not. That would be like if we offered you CJ McCollum for Joel Embiid.      Y'all can't just trash the guy calling him a garbage and useless player then just expect to trade him for one of the best point guards in the NBA lmao."
"&gt; Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid and Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic -- right on his heels.  So Jokic was right behind him and Jokic’s 2nd half of the season was more impressive than his 1st half.  Not to mention, that ranking is subjective and not a true representation of NBA voters. It was something ESPN put together to imitate the MVP voting.  Not to mention their was multiple points prior to embiids injury where Jokic had better odds."
"Exactly. Gobert is an excellent player in his element but if you match him up against a guy who is 6’7 and has three point range, that guy hurts him more than the other way around. There’s a reason Joel Embiid or Nicola Jokic don’t get played off the court in playoff games, but Gobert does and Zubac should."
"even joel embiid publicly blamed him for the loss, if he doesn't care something is truly wrong with him"

Imagine Joel Embiid catching the ball at the top of the paint and having 3 guys perfectly spaced around the court like Ayton did there. Watching that honestly makes me feel ill. It's like the Suns play on a court that's twice as big as the Sixers did this year
"Yeah, comparing Kidd and Simmons as shooters is like comparing Joel Embiid and DeAndre Jordan.   Kidd was shooting 3-5 threes per game and hitting them at between 30% and 37% for most of his 20s. Also, other than his first 3 seasons, he was around 80% from the line."
"I think the Embiid thing is way overblown, they asked him what the turning point of the game was and he answered with the honest answer and didn't explicitly throw Ben under the bus. Obviously Joel is also upset and tired after that game so he isn't going to carefully check everything he says  Doc on the other hand was inexplicable, you don't do that to one of your own players. Even if you're lying out of your ass and everyone knows it you still have to speak with confidence about your guys. I was really shocked to see him say that frankly"
Joel Embiid isn’t Wayne Gretzky.
Yea let’s celebrate Trae young for foul baiting but shit on Joel embiid for it fun
"&gt;  Ben is the shitty line up. You have to play him because that's what the organization dictates.....that's what the fan base (up until recently) dictates. What's Doc supposed to do? Not play/start Ben take the entire crowd of it and possibly make it awkward for the team?  Yes! He's not Joel Embiid. Lue did it with the cavs. Benching kyrie is not as crazy as benching LeBron. Come on dude. It's about making it through the game first and winning the games.   &gt;If we are being honest Ben shouldn't have been on the floor for 36 mins last game, he should have been on floor 20-25 max because that the kind of production he puts out.  I agree with that. I don't see him as that kinda  of player. I see ben for what he is, a solid defensive guy who's a good playmaker. It jsut sucks he has a fat contract. Otherwise, I'd like to see him with Kawhi and PG.  &gt; But that's not what people really want because that would just become another excuse to use.   I disagree with this dude. I'm sorry, but I think its a silly notion to say the coaches and the organization are pandering to fans instead of winning playoff games. There's A LOT AT STAKE. You don't think you could rationalize with the owner, if we want to win this game, or even this series, we have to bench simmons or a key player in a game? What do you think the owner would say? They would say Abso-fucking-lutely! There's literally millions and probably billions riding on this.   &gt;I think Doc did the right thing exposing Ben so the team can move on.  you're entitled to your opinon. When doc has another player in his place and doc fails again, I'm curious to see what you will say then."
Here’s a really good [article](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid) that sums up some of the mental problems that Ben Simmons has and why some believe he won’t ever gain a jumper or accept a different role until he changes his mindset
"Joel Embiid earned the right to be pissed. Dude poured his heart and soul into this series on a meniscus injury. Logged his highest minutes total ever in a series, logged his most efficient scoring playoff run with 51/39/83 shooting splits. If the Sixers were starting an average conventional point in this series they win in 5.   Doc was a piece of slime."
Joel Embiid: are you going to do your job?  Ben Simmons: no.
"This article makes it seem more like Ben was being coddled by his internal group, whereas the Sixers gave him pretty specific instructions on what to work on. https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid"
James harden and Joel embiid in shambles
Joel showed the hell up. Having Lowry to space the floor and let Embiid dominate inside even more would really have wrecked whatever the Hawks wanted to do defensively. Especially with how great Seth Curry and Tobias Harris (minus game 5 and 7)
"It much more easier to build around the Jay's, then it is with Embiid/Simmons (You can build a team around Joel, but not with Simmons there)"
One guy was a master of transition offense and the other plays with Joel Embiid. It's fucking ridiculous that Simmons isn't on a team that runs the break
"This guy confused Allen Iverson with Joel Embiid, yikes."
Joel Embiid in shambles if you want to talk about Trae
"Joel embiid, Seth Curry , thybulle, maxey, korkmaz  yeah that's cool the problem is you got Max trash brother twins on the salary cap"
"ah yes 25 or 26 teams would love ben simmons, a max contract guy with no shooting ability or mental fortitude to change his game, and joel embiid, who while good, is often injured and just played on a slightly torn meniscus"
“76ers situation” is just Joel Embiid. Everything else is kinda in the way. That being said I’d love to have Joel Embiid.
"I think you should just accept that there is no improving with him. [Even LSU's beat writer had a scouting report pre-draft](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-76ers/not-worthy-no-1-lsu-reporter-details-concerns-ben-simmons ) that just matches what we see of him today.  &gt;""To me, he's more of a specialist player and a complementary player than someone who can really take over a team,"" Guilbeau said. ""He's not a strong, inside player like a brute. A physical player. And he also does not shoot from the outside, which is amazing, but he's a great passer and a great scorer.""  &gt;Complementary player? Can't take over a team? Say what?  &gt;""I don't think he should be the first pick,"" Guilbeau said. ""I can see him being a high first-round pick. It depends on the team he's going to. Do they have enough of the other parts of the team where he can be a facilitator and a complementary player?  &gt;""He would have to go to a team where he can flourish as a complementary player, a team that has a very good center.""  &gt;The Sixers are loaded in the front court with Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel and potentially Joel Embiid. But a first overall pick is not supposed to be a complementary player.  &gt;""I think you could develop him to be as good as he could be, but not be that type of star,"" Guilbeau said. ""It's kind of strange to me. Before he ever played he was supposed to be the greatest player, and I just never saw it. I covered great players here like Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson, and he just didn't change a team like those guys did."""
"Why does he have to be stronger and more athletic? It’s this kind of delusional thinking that leads to people arguing about how they played against milkmen and electricians.  I understand they were very good for their time, but Joel Embiid is Joel Freakin Embiid. You know what Joel Embiid would have done to Jerry west and Ron Baker?"
"Yes, but Ben alone hasn't wasted Embiid's prime. The Sixers have always had a long laundry list of issues hampering their ability to win, from bad coaching, to suspect roster management, to underperforming players.  2019 was the strongest version of this Sixers team and these were Embiid's point totals against the Raptors in that fateful second round:  G1: 16 PTS, .278 FG%   G2: 12 PTS, .287 FG%   G3: 33 PTS, .600 FG% (infamous airplane celly game)   G4: 11 PTS, .287 FG%   G5: 13 PTS, .500 FG%   G6: 17 PTS, .357 FG%   G7: 21 PTS, .333 FG%  He's one of the most dominant big men we've seen in this era and the only time he scored more than 21 points in that series, he showboated so much he likely just motivated his opponents and the opposing team's fans further.  I've literally never seen the Raptors go into a game against the Sixers where I felt any fear of either Ben Simmons or Joel Embiid. For how genetically and physically gifted as they are, *both* have historically underperformed and *both* are at fault for contributing towards the Sixers woes since the process began."
"&gt;Nobody is talking how Joel Embiid made 4 for 20 in Game 4, or missed 2 critical free throws at the end of Game 5, its all Ben Simmons  Dude what? People aren't talking about that because Embid dominated and carried the 76's pretty much every other game. Nobody is criticizing that because they watched the games and can see how good Embid was and how bad Simons was.    When you're losing games by a few points and one of your star players is going 4-20 every game, and refusing open dunks in crunch time of game 7, its understandable why people would blame him and not the dude scoring 40"
Does Joel Embiid play the part of Little John in this analogy?
"Oh, we knew about Joel Embiid. It wasn’t like he didn’t exist."
https://sports.yahoo.com/doc-rivers-joel-embiid-raise-doubts-about-their-confidence-in-ben-simmons-after-game-7-loss-045651369.html  I am not.
Here you go. In the second section: https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid
"Joel Embiid after every playoff loss: ""I've got to work harder and come back stronger.""     Ben Simmons after every playoff loss: ""I am who I am."""
"We need more of this. As a Chicago Bears fan in the midst of the double doink we were all mad at Cody Parkey, but every teammate stood up for him on social media. Coach did the same in postgame interview.  Hawks chipped away at the Sixers' thumbscrews, and they couldn't adapt after the shake up. Nobody is talking how Joel Embiid made 4 for 20 in Game 4, or missed 2 critical free throws at the end of Game 5, its all Ben Simmons. Its on the fans to hold the team and players accountable for being good, but teammates and coaches should never resort to scapegoating, regardless if he was by far their weakest point."
"Don't tell Sixers fans that, they will just put their hands over their ears and shout 'lalalala I can't hear you!!'             Embiid has the biggest pass on that sub, he could have averaged 2ppg this last series and all the blame would still be thrown at Simmons. The guy is an incredibly injury prone big who has literally spent more than half his career injured on the bench. They are deluded if they think they can rely on him to bring them a championship because he literally gets injured every damn year and was of course injured with a torn freakin meniscus against Atlanta and was at long odds to finish the post season if they did somehow make the Finals. But again, Joel is immune to any criticism on that sub, it's crazy..."
"Wilt was an athletic freak of nature. Dude not only played basketball but also did track and field in college. By all eyewitness accounts, he was also ridiculously, cartoonishly strong. I don't know about his injury history, but in a modern setting, his comp would probably be that of a stronger, more athletic Joel Embiid."
Jimmy Butler led his team to the finals yet no one is saying he's better that Joel Embiid. Jason Tatum led his team to ECF yet no one is saying he's better than Anthony Davis who has no playoff success that time.
"if simmons was a fringe starter or a role player  if simmons was playing poorly due to injury  if simmons was on the record working on a single aspect of his game  if simmons wasn’t on the record literally saying “appreciate what I do” when asked if he’ll ever develop a jump shot  if simmons didn’t just sign a MAX to do “what he does”  even if simmons just started jacking up the open 3’s teams give him and went 1/15  …this wouldn’t be happening. he went first overall, to the toughest city in sports, played for a max contract, and immediately stopped trying to improve his game in any way. wrecking not only the 76ers’ immediate future, but that of one of the best players in the league in Joel Embiid.  it’s childish and embarrassing and deserves criticism as much as anything in sports, no?"
Really fascinating to see Joel play MVP caliber for one game and run out of juice a couple days into a trip. Philly's playoff run may be dependent on Simmons becoming a shooter because I definitely don't see Embiid playing at a top level for 16 games.
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
you don't even have to look that far from the sixers lmao joel embiid is shooting 84% on about 10 FTA a game.
**Guys averaging 20+ppg on 65%+ TS:**        Kevin Durant - 31.3 PPG on 66.9% TS            Joel Embiid - 26.4 PPG on 66.3% TS            Nikola Jokic - 25.1 PPG on 65.8% TS                      Paul George - 24.4 PPG on 68.5% TS                    That's insane efficiency. KD in particular is pretty jaw-dropping.
"It's the only way that big men get calls in the league. Getting calls is important for him because if he didn't, every loser critic would be commenting ""WhY wOuLd yOu pUT yOUR BodY aT RIsK? DoES he wAnT a ShOrTeNeD CaREeR? He'S InJuRy pRoNe!!!1""  Embiid is smart, he knows his limitations and he sees that sometimes the path of least resistance is the best option.    Side note, he gets into player's heads, a trademark of the classic center position. Theis hit Joel in the face three times out of frustration trying to get rebounds and there weren't calls. The centers that traditionally do well vs Joel are the ones that don't break mentally.   As for the ""great centers of the past,"" they largely couldn't shoot a napkin into a trash can from a foot away, there's a reason they didn't call attention to free throws, there's a reason they wouldn't shoot from further than 4 feet away. And their opinions are worth just as much as any redditor on the matter, who the fuck cares what they think on the matter? They don't get to delegitimize someone's current-day prowess because it doesn't fit the mold for their past performance.    And Smart isn't just a fined-by-the-NBA-for-flopping-do-badly flopper, he's a dirty player. Always some stink that he gets to add in close games. Always wants some form of attention. He's either hitting people in the groin or getting clear path fouls or getting T's or flagrants. Embiid plays through contact to get to the line. Smart plays for contact to harm the other players."
Don't you ever besmirch Billy Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid is a pleasure to see this season.  He seems to be back at his best.
"Right but don’t you think that it’s unfair for Clippers fans (who have dealt with months of nonstop jokes after the 3-1 meltdown) that they seemingly can’t celebrate or be happy for regular season success? I see so many Paul George comments about the great season he’s having flooded with “wait until Playoff P shows up”, but nobody else really gets the same treatment except for Giannis (for example a guy like Joel Embiid is receiving praise for his performance thus far). Everyone loves to bring up that embarrassing 50 point loss the Clippers had to the Mavs after Christmas, but then say “regular season doesn’t matter” after they have a big win."
ESPN: Does Ben Simmons hate Joel Embiid? Simmons is single-handedly tanking Embiid's chances at MVP.
Joel gets free throws because guys can't guard him one on one. Also bigs aren't used to defending other bigs facing them up. Guys get their hands on him like he's backing them down in the post and he just swipes his hands through their arm and walks to the line. It's a clear foul.   There just aren't many centers that can guard Embiid one on one consistently without fouling.
"Yeah, Marc has always sonned Joel. Happened before 2018, happened after 2018.           Marc is strong and he reads footwork and opponent’s game really well. Embiid can’t get to his spots and just throws the ball to the rim to get bailed out with a foul. Embiid’s Gasol problem isn’t a fluke."
It happens when Danny Theis and T-Thomp get neutered by the great Joel Embiid. They had no answer for him but to hack him.
Joel Embiid 100% flops a ton. To be called out by Marcus Smart who also flops a ton is hysterical.   Both know how to take advantage of who is guarding them and how to draw contact. It’s frustrating for opposing fans but important in game settings.
"Joel embiid is just a taller, more talented, sexier Marcus smart."
"Yeah that's my argument when people bring up Joel when I complain about flopping. I'm against the guys who flop around the 3pt line rather than attempt to make a solid shot (LeVert, Dinwiddie, Harden, Smart, to name a few). Guys like Embiid get legitimately beat up, and refs absolutely don't call enough fouls on post ups or in the paint relative to the contact that goes on there"
"4th Nov 2019 last play of the game jokic flops on embiid to give Joel an offensive foul and seal the game  21st January 2020 jokic flops on harden to get a free throw, it's embarrassing look it up   There's 2 within 2 minutes of research  Shut up you're wrong"
"It does, as does Brad's 27-11 record vs the 76ers.  Also [this nice little clip:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS3gVGLLp7M) Joel Embiid on 76ers-Celtics rivalry: 'This is not a rivalry like JJ Redick said... They always kick our ass'"
Have you tried having Joel Embiid on your team? It's really helpful.
Just like the Celtics just ate all 84 inches of Joel Embiid.
Imagine Sixers fans having Joel Embiid on their team and thinking other teams are wrong for complaining about fouls.
Embiid had 42 in 32 minutes. Not great obviously because no Tatum but Joel dominated like he’s been doing all year.
Joel Embiid a foul call? Well I never...
*gasp* Joel Embiid has never initiated contact in his life.
Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid
Embiid is the only player called Joel Embiid to ever score a point in the NBA  That's my MVP
Joel Embiid has already attempted more 3s this season than Ben Simmons has in his whole career.
You literally root for Joel Embiid
Ok? Embiid shouldn’t do that move either. Shits whack.    Whataboutism in an r/nba game thread is stupid. “What about Joel he did it”. Great. Who cares it’s a lame move to do when you get locked up and have to take a fadeaway jumper or you shoot a contested 3 over a rookie
"This is a fun game to watch. The Celtics are making tough shots, and Joel Embiid is playing like an MVP."
"IDK how the center on the pistons is, but he was looking like Joel Embiid out there.  Contract year Drummond is here. Old manJordan don't stand a chance."
Look at the vote breakdown during those years.    KD finished around 7-9 each year.    Players like John Wall Paul George Joel Embiid Jokic and Damian Lillard all finished above him. And he finished slightly above Demar DeRozan.
"Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Jerry West and Rick Barry all come to mind. Good shooters, good passers, those guys were phenomenal, they would excel in any form of basketball in any decade, but would be even better now.   Magic Johnson would be akin to Russell Westbrook, only 6'9. He'd be a menace in today's game and compared to Zion and Lebron with his athletic abilities, size and skill.   Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic would've been even more frightening in 90s Isoball era. Nikola Jokic especially, it takes a whole team to stop his passing and shooting.   Shaquille O' Neal in todays game would score 45 points a game. Early 90s Shaq, before he ate/lifted to be so heavy was a damn freak. And there wouldn't be anyone who could stop it.   And finally AD, put that guy in any era of basketball, and he's amazing. But late 70s ball? he'd be equal to Walton, Moses, Kareem, McAdoo, Lanier and be on teams whose sole business would be to let him unleash havoc on D."
"I totally buy that Ingram is serious about improving and that JJ's praise is legit, honestly think he'll be a perennial all-star.  That being said I gotta point out that as long as JJ has been around, he hasn't really played with guys particularly known for their hardcore commitment or study of the game. In his career the other stars he played with were Dwight, Blake Griffin and a young Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons, so when he says Ingram watches more film than any of his non-Chris Paul teammates it *might* not be such a big deal."
Joel Embiid
Yessir. I knew instantly this kid was legit when I watched the highlights of him dropping 32 on Embiid and Horford’s head at the end of last season.   Of course the Pistons lose because I mean they just aren’t good but Wood showed tf out and even rejected Joel 2x on face up plays
"Yes, that’s valid. However, these stats that I was referring to took the last 3 seasons into account, iirc. Embiid will get volume stats, but they do a pretty good job defending him. However, kanter was a valuable piece there. We’ll have to see how Thompson does as a replacement.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-joel-embiid-posts-up-the-celtics-are-ready/amp/"
"Oh you don’t see how a guy with a three-year career that never attempted a single shot within five feet of the arc would have an issue adapting? Embiid’s average shot distance is &gt;4x Oden’s. Not everyone can magically find range. Greg would be Steven Adams, not fucking Joel Embiid who is just shy of 40% from deep on the year. What even is this discussion jfc..."
Nephews don't remember the Blazers losing a Markelle Fultz and Joel Embiid-esque duo to career ending injuries.
* LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Joel Embiid  Throw in some shooters and it's over.  If you want to throw in Durant then you'll have to swap out James.
“And what a night Joel Embiid. 41 points and 18 rebounds. 76ers 119 Nets 143. Nets take the series 4-1”
"Joel Embiid, also Jack Sikma if you want spacing"
ESPN later today:  “An Eastern Conference Assistant GM confirms that both Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid have been asked about in trade talks”.
"man Shamet's career is so tragic, dude has been trade bait 3 times now as a rookie. Yes he's literally gotten to play with Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant and James Harden but mother of god the dude is treated like livestock"
imagine ranking Khris Middleton ahead of Joel Embiid
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal
"In the words of Joel Embiid ""it's not a rivalry they always kick our ass"""
Joel Embiid.
Rookie thought he was gonna get by Marc Gasol lmao that man held Joel Embiid to 0 points in a game last year.
"They arent capped at all. If you have Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, all you need to do is surround them with shooters and thats a fantastic team. The issue in Philly has never been Joel or Ben, its always been the terrible coaching staff and supporting cast around them. Bens gonna get traded at some point in the next few years and look like a stud and everyone is gonna be doing the pikachu face wondering where its been all along, when the answer is Phillys front office has been notoriously garbo for years. Its like people havent learned from Jimmy Butler or JJ Reddick both saying how much of a dumpster fire management and the coaching staff in Philly were."
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
Gobert. I feel like Joel Embiid deserves the center spot this year.
"I'd give all that up for Harden, full stop. He's an MVP candidate and you're trading a guy who might never reach that level, a rookie who had one good game under extenuating circumstances, and some picks that lose value in the near term because James Harden and Joel Embiid are on your team for at least two seasons, if not more."
"I think the 76ers would have been better going by O’Connor’s report  James Harden/Shake Milton/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Seth Curry, Thybulle and Dwight Howard off the bench  I don’t see how you stop them"
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned

My current favorite (Joel Embiid) is already more liked than my All-Timer (Wilt). Wilt is the most disrespected player of all time. Joel can never be as great. No one can.
In what world is Joel Embiid Called JE
"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard’s BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo’s two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks’ high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
For players all currently in the league I can think of   Jrue Holiday  Justise Winslow  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid
Embiid and Simmons primes is very interesting question. Joel is putting big numbers as is. I cant see it going up much further. And Simmons is how many years in the league and still no shot. I don't see that changing as well. I'm definitely subscribing just to see how that team unfolds.
He will not be All NBA this season if he doesn't step it up is more the point. There have been recent pieces [written on the subject](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/15/22232686/sixers-shooters-ben-simmons-joel-embiid).  His ppg is down to 12 and his fg% is about 50. That won't get you all NBA nowadays and hurts their chances to win it all.
Joel Embiid
"Oh ok, are we playing wrong answers only? Joel Embiid"
"I don’t need some nerd stat to know the truth.   I’ve watched 90% of the Pistons games since like 1993. I’ve seen everything with Drummond. From my television, in person and on every single stat sheet.   Most Detroit fans rip him to shreds. I don’t. I like him.   He fills up a stat sheet unlike most we’ve ever seen at his position, but so much of it’s empty. He gets destroyed by most elite centers, or even pretty good ones, not just Joel Embiid.   He’s looked great so far this year. I’m happy for him. I really feel like he’s putting the work in.   Defensive Win Shares? That Pistons team wasn’t winning shit. I watched loss after loss. I watched Drummond get his numbers and often have little impact on the defensive end, which explains some of the lack of winning.   He has not been a Top 15 defensive player at any point in his career, prior to this season. He’s just not. He gets counting stats, but that doesn’t mean he’s elite defensively.   Again, I don’t want to rip on Andre. I like him and I actually think he got a bad rap and was unfairly casted in Detroit, however, don’t be ridiculous.   I’m proudly holding up my 2043 2nd round pick we received back for him in a trade. Clearly, lots of value around the league."
Giannis and Kenyon Martin  Joel Embiid and Jason Richardson
the one thing embiid of joel did better than em ;)
"They have zero defense against joel embiid &amp; ben simmons as well though, its an interesting matchup"
The team with James Harden and Joel Embiid plus an elite defense
"I think it’s a very interesting question. Based purely on basketball, Harden is an obvious upgrade 1 for 1 over any other player on the Sixers. But there are a few worries I would have trading for him:  Facilitation - Embiid needs shooters. Everyone knows that. Seth Curry is already proving how good Embiid and shooters can make each other. But I don’t think Embiid needs a black hole who always has the ball. I’m not saying I wouldn’t be floored to add Harden to this team, but I do question whether he would bring as much out of Joel as the Curry/Green combo has so far. Losing Ben would yet again expose us as a team without a top tier ball handler. I guess Shake or Tyrese could fill that role in coming years, but not during a potential 2021 playoff run.  Personality - we all know Harden loves his strip clubs and parties. He’s also proving to be outspoken and occasionally controversial during his departure from Houston. He also has historic hiccups with staying in game shape. I think all of these things could have the potential to aggravate or influence Joel in a negative way. Joel has also been the leader of this team for 5+ years now. A player like Harden coming in with more talent and that personality could be rough   Conclusion: I wouldn’t say no to James Harden on my favorite team, but I think there’s reason enough to believe he might not be the perfect fit he was touted as, and I think the sixers are fine the way they are"
"Imagine if someone said ""Tell Joel Embiid '*click click* anansi zulu timbuktu.'"" Dude would be out of a job before he finished his sentence."
COTY - Nate Bjorkgren  MIP - Christian Wood  6MOTY - Chris Boucher   ROTY - Tyrese Haliburton   DPOY - Joel Embiid   MVP - I have no clue rn  Philly trades for Kyle Lowry and make it to the Finals but lose to the Lakers in 6 games.
"Imagine Ernie telling the same “jokes” about Loul Deng being from Cameroon... or Joel Embiid being from Ethiopia... or Serge Ibaka being Cuban... or Bol Bol coming from Kenya. But really if Shaq were a comedian this kind of humor probably wouldn’t be questioned, heck, it’s barely even questioned as it is."
"That's true. The way he drags Joel Embiid through the mud whenever he gets the chance is super dumb, he sees Joel can be as dominant as him so when he has a bad game he reminds everybody that Shaq never had a bad game and keeps Joel lower in everybody's opinion."
"Joel is the current MVP, but its still early.  IMO Embiid hasn't shown that he can stay healthy long enough to win MVP, so he shouldn't be the favorite at this point.  LeBron is probably the favorite to MVP, though if Embiid continues his production while not missing too many games, he should win it."
Ohh you must mean Future Joel Embiid
"After the game last night, I’m kind of low on Embiid MVP. I think he has a strong narrative, but his team is *so good*. Sixers are absolutely bananas. There’s no clear cut “star” (I mean Simmons, but his lack of scoring helps Joel) besides him, but the role players are really insanely good.  Consequently... I am *high* on a Jokic MVP season. They need a top 3, maybe top 4 record and he’ll probably get it. The narrative is helped by Grant tearing it up for the Pistons and Murray setting expectations way too high so it seems like he’s regressed."
"Duncan Robinson, Danny green and Joel embiid"
"I've always been hesitant to say that Shaq didn't reach his potential since he wasn't in the best shape in the regular season. The fact is human bodies are not meant to be the size of Shaq and its even more rare that a body his size was that explosive and athletic. Shaq gets very defensive about this and responds ""you don't know my body like I do"" when Chuck makes fun of him for it.   If in an ideal world Shaq could have been in playoff shape 365 days a year for 10 years he would have had 10 titles and 10 MVPs. But if you look at the careers of big NBA guys like Yao or even more recently Embiid you see they are always plagued with injuries. It took Joel something like 3 years with the financial resources of an NBA franchise to get his body to a point where he could play most games in a season. He still gets full body massages before games to help ease his back issues.   Its not reasonable to assume that Shaq could go 100% for a full regular season and postseason run and it would have no negative consequences. We even see this with Westbrook where he would lose steam late in the playoffs and he is the definition of an athletic dynamo.   Shaq and the Lakers had some postseason runs where they came up short before the 3-peat. Maybe Shaq felt like he just didn't have the energy late in the postseason when he needed it most and thought the best way to combat that was to play himself in shape during the regular season knowing he had Kobe there to keep them at a high seed."

"I need the Pistons to win so badly tonight. I hate the fucking Sixers. In fact they're my least favorite team in the NBA right now and it's not even close.  Fuck Embiid and his trashtalking ass. Shut the fuck Up and go accomplish something first.  Fuck the Process. Fuck Sam Hinkie. It's not adorable to be utter shit for several years by choice. It's pathetic.  Most of all FUCK THE MEDIA for all the attention they spend on these loosers despite them not even trying to win fucking games.  Fuck the Media for celebrating every tweet of Joel ""69% conditioning"" Embiid. I was so happy when I saw Jalen Rose told that punk to shut his mouth and act like a professional.  But most of all Fuck them for crowning their asses before they've done anything. At this point ""RoCo"" (what a stupid nickname) is the wet dream of half the NBA writers across the League. Ben Simmons is LeBron 2.0 and Embiid is basically Shaq with a 3 point shot.  Fuck the Sixers, Fuck Embiid, Fuck Sam Hinkie, Fuck the Process. Also FTP.  EDIT: LOL I see a lot of Sixers fans coming over here acting like fucking childs. Let me just say this:  I have more respect for the 2008 Detroit Lions than for the 2015/16 Sixers as the Lions at least tried to win a game."
i just drank a whole bottle of wine and i love joel embiid ama
"From all the reports though Joel knows the deal. He’s super tight with Morey and they play tennis together and stuff so he knows their plan is to trade him once they get a viable offer, so that’s why the deadline will be the first major time for a trade. If jo got fed up enough and said he’s done dealing with it, then I think Morey would have to concede but part of the plan has always been having Embiid in the know so as long as we’re at least in the playoffs by the deadline and don’t go completely off the rails (which would only happen if Jo missed a month or two) I think it should be okay on that front."
[Breaking News] Sixers meeting with Simmons was “intense” and “at one point Joel Embiid was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned
"&gt;Ben Simmons spoke to Doc Rivers, Joel Embiid and entire 76ers team today and accepted everyone needs to take responsibility  ""Look, we're all trying to find the guy who did this."""
"Sources: Ben Simmons spoke to Doc Rivers, Joel Embiid and entire 76ers team today and accepted everyone needs to take responsibility, including himself — but Simmons informed them all that he’s not mentally ready to play yet and needs time. 10:54 AM · Oct 22, 2021·Twitter for iPhone  Lol"
"His stats don’t tell that story. His 3pt percentage has been about the same except for one year and his attempts has been the same. He always shot 3s and worked from the 3 point line and it wasn’t for Ben. A majority of his 3s are from the top of the Key and the Rest of his point lead are on the blocks and the elbows, how does that help Ben because if he’s at the top of the key where is Ben? And where is Ben during all these post ups which have gone up through the years. https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-shot-chart-by-season"
"There should be bets on the content of the next Shams tweet about Ben Simmons that says notjhing.  I'll go with: *[Charania] Ben Simmons ate lunch with the rest of the Sixers team at the facility, and sat 10 feet from Joel Embiid. They both ate fries. There's still no timetable for his return, but sources say the Sixers wil serve fries again tomorrow.*"
C’mon now even 76ers players themselves (not named Joel Embiid) are saying he was thrown under a bus. Matisse Thybulle said those exact words on camera in JJ Redick’s podcast.

"This assumes that everything will stay the same as it is right now. Trading Ben right now doesn't increase your chances of winning. Keeping Ben doesn't increase your chances of winning. Neither option helps, but keeping him leaves your options open. If you trade him for scraps, that's it. You have scraps. If you keep him, maybe around the trade deadline a team thinks they need an elite defender, transition passer and playmaker. Then you get more than scraps.  The team chemistry won't take a hit because Ben has already done all the damage he can do. The fans are from Philly, they're down to make Ben suffer no matter the cost.  If Joel Embiid tells you to trade Ben, you trade Ben for scraps but until that happens Morey has nothing to lose by keeping him."
"Well first you’re defending a guy that ignored the entire team and organization all summer and passed up open dunks because he was scared of going to the line. Second, no one threw him under the bus lol embiid and doc talked about him for about 15 seconds each in a 10 minute post game interview and people act like they spent the whole summer calling him soft. Both doc and embiid had critical words for Ben but they also blamed themselves for the loss and Sixers fans have also been critical of doc all summer for his bad rotations in that series. Joel had been particularly positive about Ben up until he got tossed from practice where the situation is now clearly untenable and none of that by the way is an excuse for how Simmons is acting and no one has to walk back their words because he’s just proving everyone right, he’s soft and a coward"

Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don’t result in superstars is flat out wrong."
Joel Embiid finished 2nd in MVP voting and got 2nd team all NBA. I think that point is relevant. All NBA finishes do need to be looked at in context
So yea embiid is better right ? You can’t say Dwight is better than Embiid because his defense unless Joel embiid is a defensive liability ? which he’s not Joel’s a great defender in his own right.
It’s like this Joel offensively can do everything you need him to. Imo he’s 10 better in offense then Dwight. And you can’t hack-a-Embiid because he’s a great Ft shooter and he’s a great post passer unlike Dwight. Now defensively it’s hard to judge because Prime Dwight didn't play in this type of basketball with that spacing and teams back then wasn't asking Dwight to switch onto perimeter players so i wouldn't know how to judge that( he'd probably be decent at it ig. Plus embiid dominates with point who hurts his spacing and makes him work harder to score. Imagine Joel on them Orlando teams he would put 30 a night with the same type of defense as Dwight. imo
"Joel isn't better than Prime Dwight. Dwight was the best defensive player in the league for like 4 years STRAIGHT and took a bad Orlando team to the Finals. Joel Embiid has had a TON of talent around him the past few years and hasn't accomplished anything.  I like Embiid's game, though. He's very good. I don't think he projects to match Dwight, and to be honest, I don't think any big in today's game does. Giannis is probably the best comparison to Prime Dwight offensively, but he's nowhere near Dwight defensively."
&gt;List of players Anthony Davis is competing with for All NBA Center positions:  &gt; &gt; &gt;- Joel Embiid &gt; &gt;- Nikola Jokic  So only the top 2 MVP vote getters last year for only one spot? That's it? How underwhelming 🙄  You could maybe say it was due to weak competition if he wasn't also getting multiple top 5 finishes in the MVP voting (Pierce never even got one of those). That means the voters had him as a top 5 player in the league that year either way.
"List of players Paul Pierce was competing with for All NBA Forward position:   - LeBron James  - Tim Duncan  - Dirk Nowitzki   - Kevin Garnett  - Tracy McGrady  - Chris Webber   - Carmelo Anthony    List of players Anthony Davis is competing with for All NBA Center positions:    - Joel Embiid  - Nikola Jokic      That pretty much sums up the difference in All NBA selections right there for ya   Everything besides that is pretty self evident. More All Star appearances, FMVP, could actually consistently carry a team to the playoffs etc"
Joel Embiid is a beast on defense and he guards the rim so therefore he is a better defender
"Morey is known to have created a strong relationship with Embiid and Joel literally said the exact same sentiment less than a week ago, Embiid has bought into Morey’s plan."
I wasn’t aware that Joel Embiid could afford to wait years to have teammates that will help him compete. Morey is gonna waste his incredibly short window just so he can play “my dick is bigger” against Simmons
Joel Embiid is not leaving Philadelphia man.
"It was definitely more than just 3 years.    2013: Nerlens Noel - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2014: Joel Embiid - Injured, Missed first two seasons  2015: Jahlil Okafor - Not Injured, Mega bust  2016: Ben Simmons - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2017: Markelle Fultz - Injured, Missed 68 games in Rookie year  2018: Zhaire Smith - Injured/Near death allergic reaction, Missed 76 games in Rookie year and only played 13 total career games"
Philly fans gonna turn on him fast when they miss the playoffs because Ben isn’t there to help save them while Embiid misses games. He may have fallen apart in the playoffs last year but you still gotta make the tournament to start with and he absolutely is part of the reason the Sixers make it with Joel down for almost 30 games a season on average.
Imagine hearing this as Joel Embiid lol
"I think they could definitely win with just Joel, even just getting role players would be better than what looks like what’s gonna happen with Ben. Maxey + Embiid is looking like what they wanted with Ben anyways. But if Ben just straight up retires and they get nothing?"
And Joel Embiid is sick of the Philly front office sticking their thumbs up their asses and also wants out
"Let me explain from the top:  1. A must win game in the ECS between the Hawks and Sixers; where Ben ""The Socialite"" Simmons has a chance to layup the ball. Unfortunately, he was against DPOY candidate Trae Young. So Simmons passed the ball over to Matisse Thybulle, who got fouled and and made one freethrow. The momentum is lost and the Sixers lose. 2. During the interview, frustations build up in the coach Doc ""blows leads"" Rivers and Joel ""The Process"" Embiid. They end up throwing the over coddled socialite under the bus for the loss.  3. After an entire offseason of heckling, the young socialite demands a trade which unfortunately, the Sixers couldn't find. So Simmons sits out the camp saying he won't ever play a game for the Sixers. And ongoing drama.  Tried making it dramatic and soap-opera like. Hope this helps."
"- Ben Simmons goes on the court and starts shooting 3s from 60 feet completely sabotaging the game.  - It's half time, Ben Simmons is in the locker room  - Ben Simmons sees Joel Embiid speed walking straight towards him from across the room, he looks pissed.  You are Ben Simmons, what do you do?"

"It's funny how the narrative how shifted around Embiid and Simmons. Simmons for years was the 6ers bed rock. Always available. Always ready. Always a team-first guy. Joel on the other hand was consistently out of shape, his effort on the floor was inconsistent, and he wasn't a team-first guy at all (as evidenced by his own admission recently).  So much changes in 2 years"

Joel Embiid 2: Electric Boogaloo
"It's not a bad one [actually think the best odds of any of these is Harden +2000](https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/2022-nba-mvp-betting-odds-luka-doncic-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic) though, no Kyrie  and Durant inevitably missing time means I think there's a path to which enough voters for him. I actually bet on the Jazz U at 53.5 wins for this yr, I think expectations are probably too high"
Your GM is being really fucking stupid. Imagine letting Ben Simmons waste away on your team with Joel Embiid in his prime. This is worse than if you traded him for a few good role players
"My name is Joel Embiid. For five years I was stranded on rebuilding team with only one goal - an 6NBA championship. Now I will fulfill Sam Hinkie's dying wish - to use the list of names he left me and bring down those who are poisoning the 76ers. To do this, I must become someone else. I must become something else."
"His attitude is just superb. He's both open to criticism and great at critiquing without offending. There really are very few PEOPLE who are willing to put their ego aside and also able to shepherd people to be able to do the same. Doesn't matter what field we work in, we should all aspire to be like Joel Embiid."
"In the 20&gt; sample size? Probably not the best sample size, bud. Once again, where are we going here? What's the point you're trying to make? Ben Simmons is more valuable than Joel Embiid? Because buddy that's an atrocious take."
I don’t think it’s “playing” all of our beat/local reporters have said the same thing that Morey has laid out his plan clearly to Embiid and they both understand this situation will get uglier before it gets better. No one knows what’ll happen if there is no deal by the deadline but talk of a strained relationship with Joel and the front office right now is nonsense.
About as close as Ben Simmons got with Joel Embiid to help him out.
With Joel Embiid? Lol ok
"He should go full Kendall Roy.  ""The organization wants me to tell you that I am remorseful for my actions. That I intend to attend practice, play in games, and help the Sixers compete for a championship. But that would be deflecting blame for Joel Embiid, WHO'S A REAL BITCH."""
"He isn't practicing or working to get better at the thing the team needs him to do, the same thing that the team has needed him to do for years so that he can stop being a gigantic liability in the playoffs. Joel Embiid has come back every year and been significantly better than the last, each summer working on a weakness in his game. Ben has gotten a bit better defensively and has gotten significantly worse offensively. He is not trying to get better at the thing the team needs from him which also happens to be the most fundamental aspect of basketball"
"""Joel Embiid on last night’s team dinner:""  Bruh please this is too much, we makin drama out of dinner"
"I mean, maybe? I just watched Embiid run point pretty effectively last night.  You're arguing a pretty extreme example though. I could roll out ""oh yeah, would replacing Joel Embiid in that 5 center lineup with Frank Jackson actually make that team better?"". But this is a ridiculous thought experiment.  Generally speaking NBA teams focus on talent and figure out fit later. That's how superteams are built, that's how teams draft, that's been the focus of the collective intelligence of the entire NBA for multiple decades now. They all value talent over fit.  But yeah, I'm sure you know better. BuT wHaT iF yOu HaD 5 CeNteRs"
C: Joel Embiid C: Jason Kelce C: JT Realmuto C: Claude Giroux  can any other city compete
"A) His accolades are very countable lol  B) Yes, it's on Philly for signing him, and Philly wants him to keep playing. Half his team tried to fly out to see him and convince him to play,  I don't see a point in there.  C) Joel Embiid literally criticized him THIS WEEK. And that's saying A LOT, considering it's kind of an unwritten rule not to bash your teammates publicly."
"The relationship between Ben Simmons and the 76ers is done.  No one bothered trying to get Simmons to improve his FT when he wasn't doing it himself..... obviously a huge red flag....not sure if 76ers ever offered him to go to a sports psychologist...Doc could have just lied and said ""yeah it's possible"" and instead went ""I don't know"".....Joel pretty much called out Ben Simmons chickening out on that dunk....then Ben Simmons refused to speak with 76ers Front Office....what's worse he refused to meet with his teammates which is a big no no....front office is understandable cause they are just viewed as the suits...but your teammates are viewed among players as the in the trenches fellow workers...and then I think Embiid pretty much nail in the coffin when he said that situation is straight up disrespectful...now doc throws him out of practice and now Embiid says this..he may at best be worth one maybe two first rounders buts thats it."
Wow! Hear that guys? I’m just like Joel Embiid! Maybe I can make the NBA too :’)
wtf Joel Embiid is my favorite player now
"Joel Embiid is on the team, relax. Drummond is getting 15 minutes in a playoff game at most if Embiid is healthy."
"Simmons has had everything handed to him by being a Generational Prospect. Embiid had to work for everything, people thought Embiid was a Huge Bust and a Fat Shirley Temple addicted Broken Foot waste of a pick.  Simmons was Coddled by the Media/Team and given passes for his inability to shoot.  It's why Philly is Ride of Die with Joel and he is the King Of Philly."
"Ben Taylor (of thinking basketball) went on Jackson Frank's (sixers writer) podcast and discussed this in detail: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-build-a-title-contender-around-joel-embiid/id1567435681?i=1000533232605  Taylor argues that embiid is the type of guy you can build a championship level defense around, but his lack of playmaking makes him not good enough to be the best player in a championship level offense."
"Let me as honest as I can.   If Ben Simmons has an issue with his shooting. The Sixers have tried to help him. He refused the help. If Ben Simmons has an issue with his mental state. They have attempted to help him there too. He's clearly not getting the help he needs.   Ben has had Brett Brown publicly pleading for him to shoot more. That coach was made a scapegoat and fired. Ben Simmons didn't like not having the ball in his hands. So the Sixers self sabotaged their chance at signing a player WAY better than Ben Simmons in Jimmy Butler.   The Sixers best player, Joel Embiid, expanded his game to allow Ben more space to operate in the paint. Ben tried to paint Joel as the problem.  The Sixers have repeatedly made moves that hurt Embiid and bolster Simmons. Even today, our lack of true point guards is due to the ball needing to be in Ben's hands.   I want to like Ben Simmons, I need to like him because the dude could be an all time great if he pulled his head out of his ass. I want him to be an all time great on the Sixers and win championships.   His actions have made him a joke. His refusal to take personal responsibility for his own short comings in his professional career that he is paid EXORBINANT amounts of money is beyond silly."

"Mitigating Joel Embiid on a good night is extremely hard. If you know how to do so, there are 29 teams that would love to hear it. I've been critical of the JV signing, but if your deal-breaker for a new signing is ""can't guard Embiid"" then you're being way too picky."
He wouldn't have signed with a team who's starting center is Joel Embiid if he wasn't ok with it I would think.
"embiid wasnt even really working him, he took mostly jump shots.  Jonas had more inside looks than Joel."
Joel “Did a 180” Embiid
Allow me to introduce you to Joel Embiid
"Is it bad that, as a Sixer's fan, I'm on Ben Simmons's side? Not because he's *right*, I think he's being a baby now and Rich Paul is giving him terrible advice, but because the Sixer's Organization and Fans just will buck no criticism of how miserable a franchise they run and support.  Like, when Fultz mentally cratered and had to be traded, you can chalk that up to him as a problem. But when it happens *twice?* There's something foul in the organization.  What has Joel Embiid done to act so high and mighty? He's either been too hurt or too out of shape to carry this team in the playoffs and after a *horrific* 8 turnover performance, runs to throw his teammate under the bus.  And Rivers is so obnoxious in how he tried to snake his way out of his postgame comments. Dude, you talk shit about a player and burned that bridge and hurt his trade value to boot. Own it. You're the equivilant of a high school QB cruising on a victory 10+ years ago.  And lest we forget Toby having the worst contract in the NBA. Highway robbery for how little he does.  At the end of the day, Sixers fan's decided to declare Ben the ultimate enemy because of one meme-able play where someone threw the ball to someone who was open. There are no heroes in this story, just villains of various degrees of annoying. And it is *damning* that Ben Simmons, even after this week, is the least annoying of the bunch."
What? Are we talking about the same Joel Embiid that shot 38% from 3 last season and was almost as efficient prime kobe from the midrange?
Running out at Joel Embiid at the 3 point line is not the solution to that
"Without Ben no first line for a ""wall"" , Embiid is a great rim protector but that's not enough against Giannis , he will get his no matter what and so will Joel."
"He did but Historically Embiid isn't great on Giannis, Ben is a better Giannis defender than Joel for example also Doc Rivers is the sixers coach."
"[Link to his ""full profile""](https://www.forbes.com/profile/ben-simmons/?list=30under30-sports&amp;sh=14bcc5b175df)  scrolling down to related articles:  [76ers Suspend Ben Simmons For ‘Detrimental Conduct’; Joel Embiid Says It’s ‘Not Our Job’ To ‘Babysit Somebody’](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2021/10/19/philadelphia-76ers-suspend-ben-simmons-one-game-for-detrimental-conduct-joel-embiid-says-its-not-our-job-to-babysit-somebody/?sh=6e1d68f53b6a)"
"Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Domantas Sabonis.  Arguably Clint Capela and Nik Vucevic."
The anti-Joel Embiid.  Lebron actively babysits his teammates.
That's why I'll never hate Joel Embiid even though I am not remotely a 6ers fan. Dude talks shit regardless of the score and I respect that.
"With all due respect, do you think it makes sense to inflict this level of chaos on your team for likely the 25th-30th pick in the draft? You clearly are okay with a CJ for Simmons swap - was that not on the table earlier this year? The longer this goes the less leverage Morey has right? Given that other GMs know he HAS to make a deal at the deadline.  Is it so hard to admit that a GM may have made a mistake?   &gt; But the deal cannot put us two steps back when we have an MVP Joel Embiid who just signed on for additional years.  No deal = two steps back. Taking a deal = one step back. Embiid cannot shoulder the load of an entire team alone for a season and expect a playoff run. But yes, I guess we'll see if Morey can swing for a player better than CJ."
"It’s devoid of context to say that Embiid has played 2 seasons longer than Ben. Embiid didn’t even play til like the back half of the 2017 season, and Ben got drafted that offseason. And really? You’re attempting to ask what Embiid has done that Simmons hasn’t? Aside from the fact that he has more All NBA teams than Ben, more All Defensive teams, and more MVP recognition, he’s also a better scorer, rebounder, shooter, and arguably even a better defender by nature of the position. The only thing Ben does better than him is pass and dribble. You may not think that an “almost MVP” and a few 2nd teams aren’t indicative of Embiid being better because of the nature of the position, then just look at their stats. Nearly every advanced metric paints Embiid as the massively better player than Simmons. Saying that it would be better to build around Simmons instead of Embiid since the latter is more injury prone is stupid as though the difference is huge. Since their redshirt seasons, Ben has only played 15 more regular season games that Embiid, and they’ve played as many playoff games as each other. Ben isn’t exactly an iron man these days. Add in that Joel actually shows up in the playoffs, it’s evident who’s the better player to build around."
"+- is shorthand for plus minus. it is a stat that is used to measure the point differential when they are on the court. so while Westbrook was on the court the lakers scored 25 less points than the Warriors.  this is generally regarded as a bad stat for measuring individual value except for in very large sample sizes (1+ year) because it can be influenced so much by other players on the court, I.e if the 76ers lose to the Celtics  by 30 and Joel Embiid plays every minute and plays at his usual MVP level he would have a +- of -30. If Jabari Parker also plays all 48 minutes he would have a +- of 30, despite being a much worse player, his +- would be misleadingly inflated by his team playing well. it is useful in large sample sizes as a rough indicator of him much value a player provides to his team, such as Tim duncan having one of the highest career +- ratings ever, because he consistently helped his team be better than the other team."
"Joel Embiid had a 37, 39 and 40 point game against the Hawks on one knee and then still dropped 31 points in game 7.      Bob didn't take a single shot in the fourth quarter of four straight playoff games. When Ben's terrible work ethic and play gets called out after he does nothing at all to support his teammates on the court its fair game."
"Enjoy the Lions! If you get a spare moment between watching Jared Goff and having to watch Jared Goff, take a look at some of those lineups that were run in those Sixers games after Milton was injured! Enjoy your time off, Mr. Simmons! And if you manage to find out what Joel Embiid has accomplished that Ben hasn’t, besides the numerous listed achievements that I referred to that he has, please let me know!    Enjoy your day!"
"Lmao dude you’re gonna go with David Thorpe doing a guest spot on the Ricky as your smoking gun of why embiid is a bad teammate? Cmon man. Did you even listen to that pod or did you just Google search “Joel embiid bad teammate,” click the first Philly sports radio link that popped up, and share it here? I mean come on, seriously.    It’s also very nice that you asked “what has Joel done that Ben hasn’t?”, saw I mentioned that he’s been #2 in MVP voting, and said “Well, Joel won’t win anyway.” That’s not the question - it’s “what has Joel accomplished that Ben hasn’t?” He’s been #2 in MVP voting. He’s a drastically, dramatically better player, is what he’s accomplished.    And your worst argument of all is that it would be like being mad that Joel can’t play point guard. I take that to mean that you didn’t watch Sixers preseason - when on the floor without Maxey, *Joel was initiating the offense in the half court, and took the ball across half court on inbounds. He was functionally the point guard*, because Ben Simmons fucked off because his agent thought he could get him 35 million dollars without showing up to work. A lot of guys get thrown under the bus. Mirotic got punched in the fucking face  and got busted up by Portis and kept showing up to work until he got traded. There’s no possible way you can try to delude yourself into thinking Joel Embiid is in the wrong for the situation, and there’s even fewer ways that you can convince yourself that Ben Simmons being an enormous baby is evidence that Joel Embiid is a selfish player like you claim"
"&gt;When Joel was turning the ball over left and right before he improved at passing out of double teams Ben never minded saying that we lost games because we turned the ball over too much,  Show me where Ben directly put his teammates on the spot for bad play because that's exactly what Embiid did by calling 1 play the turning point of a game. As a PG mentioning turnovers that's Ben shouldering blame too. And Embiid has always been the selfish, attention seeking player. All of the antics, constantly in the media and now he's shit talking a teammate. What has Ben said negative about any teammates? O and here's someone in the know that has said Embiid is not a great teammate. https://www.audacy.com/94wip/sports/76-ers/nba-mentor-analyst-says-joel-embiid-is-not-a-great-teammate  &gt;Doc’s quote after the elimination game was foolish  And that's just what has been said publicly. Imagine what is said behind closed doors. Like I said the post game interviews were just the last straw.  &gt;2nd in MVP voting? 3x All-NBA 2nd team? A game high of more 3s than Ben Simmons has made in his entire career  Embiid is always going to be in the discussion for MVP but likely never win it because he can't stay healthy. Ben is a 3x all-star, 2x all-defensive first team, and the best wing defender in the league that can also guard bigs. He's also playing with a great offensive talent that does not fit his game and that's normally not a problem for organizations to figure out and rectify but the 76ers don't want to admit they got it wrong trading Butler instead of him. He's not a jump shooter so you Philly fans being pissed about something he's not is like being mad that Embiid can't play PG. It's irrational, stupid, and just another possible reason why he wants out. Yall can't be happy with the player he is and complain about what he isn't. That affects a player's confidence because they're still human beings. And it's obvious from reports the organization is not fully behind Ben and likely bitter they traded Butler and he made it to a Finals appearance.  Cut ties and move on instead of acting like a bitter girlfriend."
Joel web embiid
We lost a game.  You're going to lose your #1 pick who was your 2nd best pickup out of years and years of tanking and it's basically amounted to Joel Embiid and role players because you drafted so terribly with all your other lottery picks.   We can handle the Westbrook slander and some regular season losses lol
"I think not winning DPOY fucked over Simmons big time.  Probably is extremely disgruntled with his role on team and having to take a backseat in his pursuit to develop a Lebron playstyle.  Good defense is always a bonus but I thought he wanted to play like that, no?  His role on Philly during the ""championship run"" does not contribute to this and he's taken a backseat to Joel Embiid.  IDC if he can't shoot 3's or make free throws, he needs to GTFO of Philly.  It's a terrible situation for him and his growth.  They needed to trade him for Harden and resign Butler.  Woulda been so good lmao  Simmons' role on Philly is toxic as fuck to him.  Most fans should realize his free throws % will increase if his usage increases."
"Lemme take a crack at writing the opening, but it might sound pretty similar to their moment on kawaiis shot:  2019 was a big year for the NBA's eastern conference. LeBron had dominated the conference for almost a decade, having taken his team to the Finals from 2011-2018. However, in the summer of 2019, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference, making the title of Eastern Conference Champion suddenly available to teams that didnt have a LeBron James on the roster for the first time in eight years.   One of the teams with the best shot at that title, and a shot at the 2019 NBA championship? The Philidalphia 76ers.   Two of the men who led them in 2019 were home picked. Grabbed with the number 3 and 1 pick in 2014 and 2016 respectively by General Manager Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were a lethal, towering duo (slap player stickers on here). While the league was spared initially as Embiid sat out his first two years with a foot injury, his dominant, physical game brought back memories of transcedent big men of yore, and when Simmons debuted after his own year spent recovering from foot injury, it took him just four games to notch his first triple double. His dazzling passes and imposing drives drew comparissons to Magic Johnson and Lebron James, and Philidalphia fans everwhere salivated at the prospect of this duo leading their long suffering city to glory.   Then in 2018, with Lebron James and his Eastern Conference Champion hogging ways off in the West, 76ers management pulled the trigger. Recent #1 pick Markelle Fultz was swapped for Clippers star Tobias Harris, and a disgruntled Jimmy Butler was aquired from the Timberwolves after he politely and calmly asked for a trade, coach Brett Brown had perhaps the most lethal starting five in the East, winning 10 of their last 15 games to go into the playoffs determined to complete the Process and bring glory to the City of Brotherly Love.   Through the first round of the playoffs, it looked like they would do just that, finishing off the Brooklyn Nets in a gentlemans sweep 4-1, blowing them out in 3 of their 4 wins by double digits or more.   They went up 2-1 in the second round against the Raptors, before losing a tight game 4 where Philly had chances to take the lead down the stretch. They would get blown out in game 5, but showed life in game 6 where a balanced attack by all four of Phillys stars helped force a decisive game 7.  While game 7 was in Toronto, the 76ers definitely brought the spirit of Philidalphia with them north of the border, with all four stars once again scoring in the double digits, though Toronto's superstar acquisition in Kawhi Leonard went absolutely supernova to keep the game tied down the stetch, with Toronto having only 4.2 seconds on the likely last posession of the game.   Still, with the most dominant big man in the game in Embiid, a lethal closer in Jimmy, a steady distributing hand in Simmons, and a lethal terrtiary gunner in Harris, and a somewhat hobbled Toronto roster, the 76ers liked their chances in OT. All they had to do was get a stop and-   (Clip of kawhis shot)   Oh no. Who knew a basketball could bounce that many times and still go in?   And just like that, the fruit that was so carefully nurtured by Sam Hinkie from the manure of the early and mid 2010s Sixers rotted on the vine, then all the vermin in Philly descended and tore the fruit to pieces. And probably pooped on it some more.   Collapse music."
"Embiid clowned him today, I don't thing Joel gives a fuck he can carry this team without Simmons."
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/01/14/report-rockets-owner-tilman-fertitta-was-adamant-about-not-trading-james-harden-to-76ers/  I agree there are conflicting reports, but I wouldn't think the GM who just obsessed over Harden for a decade would draw the line in the sand over Maxey. He has always been a superstars first mindset. Chris Haynes and Tim MacMahon are reliable and said Tillman just didn't want to send him to Philly. We were deep into talks, that's true though. But not fair to criticize them for ""missing out"" on Harden when it's unclear exactly what happened.  &gt;He's reeking HAVOC right now  He's on a 4 year contract. I get the uncomfort, I get it commands headlines but if we can just win basketball games it really won't matter to the level you think. I'd probably take the CJ swap but right now, in October, Portlands asks for picks from us and I'd rather just wait.  &gt;It is the easy route, because you're literally doing nothing. Procrastination is the definition of both easy and stupid.  Not fair at all. I've laid out exactly why trading him in December/January/February is a valid line of thinking and the best option for us long term. Morey has been a GM for 15+ years he's not dumb.  I'm not expecting the world in return for Ben, and neither would our front office. But the deal cannot put us two steps back when we have an MVP Joel Embiid who just signed on for additional years. Nobody wants Ben, and right now I'd rather wait till more players are available for a 3 team deal. Our leverage went to 0 when he shot 33% in the playoffs and got exposed. I really don't see the situation as you do, but when he's traded we'll find out who was right"
I like that Joel Embiid just speaks from the heart. No sugarcoating or beating around the bush. Just tells you how it is straight up.
Joel Embiid eat your heart out
"Joel just signed his extension and shopped Ben as early as for Harden last year, Sixers already chose Embiid"
Plot twist! Simmons doesn't play the sixers start the year 3-15 And Embid askes for a trade. Simmons ends up as an excellent partner for Bradley Beal and averages a triple double before proceeding to shoot 22% from the free-throw line in the playoffs as the sixers lose to the Joel embiid wizards. Simmons spends 2022 to 2023 in a body cast after being beaten up by sixer fans. The most chaotic time line!
MVP: Joel Embiid  DPOY: Anthony Davis  ROY: Jalen Green  6MOY: Tyler Herro  MIP: Terrence Mann  COY: Chris Finch
"He gets benched, then misteriously disappears after an altercation in the locker room with Joel Embiid..."
Chase Utley   Brian Dawkins   Charles Barkley   Bryce Harper   Joel Embiid    They’re perfect matches for this city
Joel embiid is tired of trusting the process
"Which most people don't understand. They quickly point to Ben's ""lack of skills"" as the problem when very easily Doc and Embiid could have kept quiet and hopes he improves the next year.   Now you got SAS talking about how Ben did this to himself because he's a poor 3 and FT shooter despite the fact he's great defensively and has amazing court IQ. No the Sixers did this to themselves by not keeping the issues in house.   At least with AD there was no ill will by either party making the transition between request and trade painless. With Ben all he is doing is staying quiet and keeping to himself till he gets moved while the Sixers are have actively put out hit pieces against him to try and make him the bad guy (and it seems to have worked). Now they want him back cause no one will confirm to their ridiculous trade demands and are getting mad that he isn't putting in the effort when he shows up.   I've said this before, this is 80% on Phily and 20% on Ben cause the only thing he has done wrong is what sparked Doc and Joel to say what they did in that conference"
Joel Embiid gets 100 million tik tok followers by waking up every morning and determining if he has bones or not.   Doc Rivers decides to do a middle part and start a rap/dance career.
"The Andre Drummond effect. Bro has no true competitive bone or desire to get better. Basketball is a means to an end for him. He wants to be just good enough to make a fuck ton of money to continue being a “young socialite”. It’s crazy because just Ben’s pure talent and size is enough for him to be one of the best defenders in the league combined with just a knack for playmaking. It’s really a shame. If he had a Joel Embiid or Giannis work ethic, there is zero reason why he couldn’t be a top 5 player."
"This article seems to agree with you...  **Is Deandre Ayton worth the max?**  Only four true centers in the NBA are making the max: Rudy Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic. Include part-time centers like Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo and the list still remains very exclusive. These are MVPs, Defensive Players of the Year, NBA champions, and NBA All-Stars we're talking about here. Thus far, Ayton has not crossed any of these thresholds.  The going rate for centers in that next lower tier down is substantially lower. Clint Capela and Myles Turner are both making less than $20 million this season, and they were meaningfully better regular-season players than Ayton last year. Capela finished sixth in Defensive Player of the Year voting and Turner finished ninth. Ayton didn't receive a single vote. Capela out-scored and out-rebounded Ayton in the regular season.  Of course, Ayton has only played  three seasons, and while his pre-draft pedigree alone shouldn't guarantee him a max contract, it does suggest more room for improvement than a typical 23-year-old NBA player would have. That upside was visible in the postseason, when Ayton grew into the sort of elite play-finisher and defensive anchor Capela was all season for the Hawks. If Phoenix believes he can maintain that form, he's immediately worth more than Capela.  The top group of centers encompasses players who are either elite shot-creators (Jokic and Towns), elite defenders (Gobert and Adebayo) or, in the rare cases of Davis and Embiid, players who are elite in both areas. Ayton might one day enter either or both of those groups, and there might be teams willing to pay him on the hope that he does. For now, he's a tier below."
"Just getting sit down interviews with Hinkie, Colangelo, Morey, Brown, Rivers, Simmons and Embiid and hearing all of their respective viewpoints on the situation would be monumentally interesting.  Hot take, it would be better than the last dance, especially if the Sixers ever win a title with Joel."
"&gt;* Doc and Joel both made comments after G7 that Simmons presumably took offense to.  I don't think we need to do any presuming. The most quoted comments were:  &gt;Asked if Simmons, the No. 1 overall pick in 2016 NBA Draft, was capable of being the point guard on a championship-level team, Rivers said, “I don’t know the answer to that.”  Rivers doesn't back him.   &gt;Asked afterward about the turning point, Embiid replied, “I’ll be honest – the turning point was just we had an open shot and we made one free throw and missed the other.""  Embiid explicitly blames the game 7 loss on one specific Simmons' play."
"&gt; Throwing Ben under the bus following an emotional playoff loss, with Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid not backing Ben up publicly created this situation.  If you think this situation started then, you have not been paying close attention to the Sixers for the last few years.  This issue goes as far back as Jimmy Butler and Colangelo."
"Ben Simmons plays point guard for the 76ers, but he can't shoot. In the playoffs, he's very limited in a half-court offense because he doesn't provide spacing. In last year's playoffs, he also shot 34% free throws. By the Hawks series, he was visibly passive on offense and hesitant to get to the foul line. That culminated in the 6'10"" [Simmons passing up a dunk over the 6'1"" Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EHA4UhYuQY) in a crucial situation, instead passing the ball.  That led to Embiid in a [post-game interview](https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/sixers-joel-embiid-doesnt-regret-postgame-comments-ben-simmons) saying, ""I'll be honest, I thought the turning point was when. . . I don't know how to say it,"" Embiid said back in June. ""I thought the turning point was when we had an open shot, made one free throw, and missed the other, then they came down and scored.""  More critically, Doc Rivers [in his post-game interview](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10006302-76ers-doc-rivers-i-dont-know-if-ben-simmons-can-play-pg-on-championship-team) said he didn't know if Simmons could be PG on a championship team.  Over the off-season, Simmons reportedly didn't plan on returning to the team and wanted to get traded away. The Sixers tried to trade him, but GM Morey was hoping to get a big package in return, and no other team was willing to give it to him. Simmons then threatened to sit out the season and forego his salary. [Several Sixers teammates wanted to meet with him during the offseason](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/09/27/danny-green-says-76ers-players-wanted-to-meet-with-simmons-on-a-personal-level/), but he turned them away.  However, after missing 2 weeks of training camp, he suddenly reported in, [presumably because he missed out on $1MM in salary](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/ben-simmons-reports-philadelphia-76ers-sources/story?id=80529998). Since he's showed up to camp, he's been isolated and seemingly disinterested in practice. Yesterday, he reportedly was seen practicing with his [cell phone in his pocket](https://sports.yahoo.com/ben-simmons-practices-with-cellphone-in-pocket-skips-team-huddle-212615443.html), though it's been disputed what was actually in his pocket. Today, [he got kicked out of practice for not wanting to participate](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32430529/philadelphia-76ers-suspend-ben-simmons-their-season-opener).  Today also gave birth to this potential Charania copypasta: [Doc Rivers asked Ben Simmons to join a defensive drill today. Simmons refused. Rivers asked again. Simmons said no again. Rivers then told Simmons he should go home, and Simmons dropped the ball and left.](https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1450506494127054854).  People are thus concluding that he clearly still wants out, is not interested in playing basketball in Philadelphia, and is only there to collect paychecks. However, [Morey and the Sixers FO still don't want to trade him unless they can get a good return](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1450521608326565890), so there is no end in sight for the drama."
"Sure, i guess looking at a situation with nuance now means you are someone's burner.  This isn't complicated buddy, they were all at fault for losing that series aginast the Hawks, from Doc to all the players (minus Seth Curry), but the organization/coaches/players all blamed Ben for literally NO reason.  Joel Embiid went to the media and literally said that he felt the turning point of Game 7 was when they had a layup, but ended up with a FT. Ben Simmons should've responded saying that he felt that the turning point of the game was when his center almost had a triple double with turnovers and his 200 million small forward shot 8-24 from the field.  They all shit the bed, but blamed one guy for it and now are shocked that this guy doesn't respect them anymore, wtf. Whatever, he is going to get traded, the Sixers will be worse because they won't get equal value and will end up as a perpetual second round team."
[Starring Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons](https://i.imgur.com/0TEeCr1.jpeg)
"I mean I want him to play like he did early in game 7, where Luka was doubled and found Boban who gave it up to KP cutting inside for two easy dunks. After that, he stayed at the perimeter and just kept shooting semi-contested 3s. You know how many times I’ve seen Embiid do a slow ass pump fake at 3, then drive inside and either slam it or eurostep for an and1. Just saying KP could easily be driving more and finding better ways to play when his shot isn’t falling. Not arguing for him to post up like Joel or AD or Jokic but you’re a 7’3” monster who’s stopping you from yamming it down with a head of steam?"
If Embiid misses game or is generally not healthy the hawks could easily do it. Sixers are incredibly reliant on Joel
Who is more important? Joel embiid or Ben Simmons?
"Yep. There will always be more injuries with KP. You're crossing your fingers for half a stretch of games where he is healthy and back in his groove.   Embiid too, but Embiid has improved his balance a lot. But that's also because Joel plays way more recklessly than a 7'1, 300 lb guy has any right too. Kristaps does almost nothing physically punishing and still breaks down."

"&gt; This is the correct forum to address Reddit's distain for black coaches, players, GMs, black anything.  Reddit's disdain for black coaches, players, GMs, black anything. You really can't be serious can you? Fucking Reddit hates black people now lmao? On one of the most liberal progressive subs?  How do you go through life with this victimhood mentality. No guys like Curry aren't absolutely adored on here. Joel Embiid isn't loved. People don't love Giannis. DeRozan &amp; Lowry aren't loved on here. Lebron doesn't get a million upvotes when he badmouths Trump.  Jesus christ.   You just make shit up. Like living in an alternate reality. The only racist is you."
"Ur high. Embiid is probably the most dominant center since Dwight got hurt. He’s getting better pretty much every year. At the worst he’s in that Patrick Ewing tier of players in that he’s an all time great who is one of the most iconic players of his generation.  He’s completely unguardable and can overpower literally anyone. Dame is great, but I’m not trading Joel for him."
TIER ONE  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  TIER TWO  5. James Harden  6. Luka Doncic  7. Giannis Atentokounmpo  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
"Where would you put him? Honestly, its hard. I think Giannis is a better player, but Luka is more dynamic obviously at least offensively. Joel Embiid had an mvp type year.   AD, is he better than AD? Maybe he's more top 10 than 5/6. I don't know I'm just saying I don't think he's better than KD lol."
"Simmons played almost all his minutes with Joel Embiid who is the best player in the series and a MVP finalist. Using +\- in this context is so ridiculous man. If Ben was better the Sixers win the game, straight up. You don’t have to use + - as a crutch.  The fact that you’re even attempting to argue Simmons over Trae here, totally unprompted, is wild."
I got 2 words for you Trae Young and Joel Embiid must see TV.
"Individuals don't win championships. Teams do. So as long as he's playing the role designed for him and the team as a whole, everyone can take their ratings and shove em. We don't hear what his coaches tell him. For all we know he's been told to focus on his defense and ignore his shot game because we have two of the best 3 pt shooters in the league starting for us with a generational talent Joel Embiid in front of them. There is a bigger picture here that all these Simmons haters gleefully ignore.   That said, mechanics. He needs to work on his shot mechanics. Weather he's been shown and ignores the teaching or is unable to perform is a different discussion entirely."
Getting defended by Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons with Joel Embiid at the rim versus Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith with no reliable rim protector.
"And embiid has?  And look who Dame has around him, compared to Joel"
Will trade bruno Fernando for Joel Embiid. Will throw in Solomon Hill and a 2nd to be nice...
You have Joel Embiid lol
Nobody is talking about it but Joel Embiid was in pretty bad pain by the end of that game. Dude still played very well but you have to wonder how he’ll hold up throughout the series
This is crazy. The game would be tied if Joel Embiid did not commit to that clear-pass sequence 10 seconds earlier...
"Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls children of all ages degeneration X proudly brings to you the tag team champions of the process, Joel “do a 180” Embiid and Ben Simmons"
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
76ers just played Joel Embiid on a torn meniscus for 38 minutes in a home playoff loss. I'll take it.
"Best outcome for Atlanta. Embiid with big minutes, running up and down, going constantly to the ground.  Wouldn't be surprised if Joel is too banged up to play game 2."
"Joel Embiid status was uncertain and he still dominated. Sixers will bounce back, play better defense. This Young Hawks team almost self-destructed in the end."
Ever since the airplane shit during Raptors/Sixers I just love watching Joel Embiid lose.
"lmao that's flagrant on Joel.    Embiid, Doc Rivera and Simmons chokes in the playoffs yet again"
Joel Embiid is +10 lmao
Triple H looks like a little person next to Joel Embiid.
"It’s a travesty that Ben Simmons reputation as a lockdown defender overshadows Joel Embiid, whose clearly their best defender."
Fans of Joel Embiid shouldn’t be complaining about foul baiting
"Joel ""Foul Merchant"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid is my least favorite player
Joel embiid is too large to flop like this
LMAO Joel Embiid is a foul baiting bitch and ya'll mother fuckers have the gall to say Trae is
"They gotta make it real dramatic. Simmons and Harris are having a worried discussion on the court, Simmons cries out ""But we can't do it without Joel!"". And then a massive tank bursts through the building, and Embiid pokes his head out of the top looking like th Terminator, sunnies on, leather jacket, smoking a cigar. He takes the cigar out of his mouth, and says ""You called?"". Then he just shoots Trae Young with the tank and its series over."
"I know Okongwu is getting worked by Embiid, but I'm so stoked for him to get this experience under his belt.  Playing Joel Embiid in the playoffs is not something you can emulate in practice."
"I think the 76ers should bring it Joel Embiid and have him bust his ass every possession to get back into this game, it's definitely in their best interest to do so"
"If we're asking if it's good or bad for Joel Embiid, any way you slice this, it's bad. I suspect if they're letting him return, it's just a small tear on the outer horn of the lateral meniscus. So, with patience and physio / sports rehabilitation there is a chance it can heal without surgical intervention.  In saying that, there is potential for the tear to deepen into the meniscus. At that point, you're looking at partial meniscectomy, which is removing the damaged piece of the meniscus. This is the surgery that Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Wade, Westbrook all had. The issue is that if/when you remove the meniscus instead of preserving it with sutures, the knee becomes a little compromised. There is the risk of bone-on-bone damage and osteoarthritis progression, there is the chance of subtle gait changes or valgus alignment and lastly, because the meniscus acts as something of a doorstopper for the joint, there is also the increased risk of ligament damage. But Jimmy, Wade, Russ all had this surgery and didn't have ligament injuries after the fact.  The 76ers and Embiid are doing a calculated dice roll. Best case scenario, he plays through this, the injury isn't aggravated, and he's able to rehabilitate the injury without surgical intervention. Worst case scenario he further aggravates the injury and needs to shut it down for surgical intervention to preserve as much meniscus as possible."
Good thing the Sixers are starting Joel Embiid over Joelle Embeed then.
Joel “Sigourney Weaver” Embiid
“Time to play the game” - Triple H aka Joel Embiid
Marc Gasol/Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid and Al Horford
"They were a sub .500 team when Embiid didn’t play this year. 10-11 record without Embiid. For those at ohh other starts sat too that’s BS as well. When all four of Curry,Harris,Simmons,Green started without Embiid the Sixers were 5-8. They are not nearly as good without Joel just facts"
I said “what’s up big fella” to Joel Embiid in NYC two years ago. Or three. Can’t remember. It was the year Kawhi eliminated him. He nodded back. Honestly my social anxiety keeps me from filming or asking for a pic haha
"Joel ""Greg Oden"" Embiid"
"Nobody, dude is just playing Dr Reddit. [This](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/nbcsports/knee-meniscus-tear-sports-medicine-joel-embiid/2835100/) is a good rundown of Embiid's injury....lots of ifs &amp; buts essentially."
If Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot gets a ring before Joel Embiid I'm gonna cut my own head off with a chainsaw
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2935956-lebron-james-passes-joel-embiid-as-mvp-betting-favorite-after-76ers-cs-injury  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lhwybc/lebron_vs_embiid_statistical_comparison/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/li2z1d/why_is_lebron_1_on_many_mvp_lists_as_opposed_to/  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/li5kyk/so_why_isnt_joel_embiid_frontrunner_for_mvp/  It was clearly 1A/1B with Embiid and LeBron, with Jokic at 3rd. A lot of people thought Jokic deserved to be the favourite, but he was never there until LeBron got hurt and the Nuggets improved their record."
"I think Embiid/Dame has a damn good chance of staying healthy. As it is, too much of the offense ends with Embiid on the ball.   With Dame on the perimeter, it unclogs the paint, giving Joel more room, less hard contact, and less chance of getting injured."
"If Joel is at 70% there's no way he's going to be able to effectively handle being put in the constant PNRs that we will assuredly be putting him in, so unless the plan is to just take him off capela altogether which opens up a new set of problems I'm just not really sure.   Maybe he plays though it fine or the injury just isn't as serious as we've all been lead to believe, also very possible, but only a 70% embiid seems like it'd cause some serious issues for the 76ers"
What if you threw in the 2021 Nets with Joel Embiid?
"Going through the old game threads! Enjoy it, you have a great team. Anyway I did not like it at all since Embiid was so vulnerable. Most of my concern was for Joel to be fine at that time. While just as dangerous, it was not as intentional or flagrant though. This was a clear intent to injure flagrant 2. Like something out of the WWE.  There's a lot about LeBron I don't always love, but was I even talking up LeBron or something?  Look DBook can ball, he's amazing. He's also a petty little bitch when things aren't going his way. Both things can be true"
Joel Embiid is the king of staying healthy in the playoffs
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
"Would teams want him? Of course, but he'd have to demand a trade.   Dame if you're reading this, playing next to Joel Embiid would make your life a lot easier"
"Even with load management, Kawhi actually played more games this year than fellow top 10 players:  -Joel Embiid  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  -James Harden  Not trying to say these players aren't great either, but the narrative that Kawhi doesn't even play the regular season is false too"
"This year really does feel like the changing of the guard in the NBA a little bit, if the Mavs close this out the remaining 8 teams will be led by their stars of:  Donovan Mitchell/Rudy Gobert (never made Finals)  Devin Booker/CP3 (never made Finals)  Nikola Jokic (never made Finals)  Luka Doncic (never made Finals)  Joel Embiid/Ben Simmons (never made Finals)  Giannis (never made Finals)  Trae Young (never made Finals)  and then KD who has won Finals/Harden who's never been  Other than the Nets it's allll fresh blood from a superstars perspective. And same from an organization perspective for the most part. Exciting times!"
1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Luka Doncic 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Joel Embiid 5. Ja Morant 6. Trae Young 7. Devin Booker 8. Zion Williamson 9. Bronny James 10. Zaire Wade
"So the issue here is contracts and age, I'm not trading Tatum for somebody that's an expiring and they need be young enough to give the Celtics a chance to give them assets, since they'd lose more than Tatum in these trades.  Giannis has a ton of years left in his contract and is still young.  Luka doesn't have a ton of years left, but he'd be a RFA and nobody signs the QO, so I don't think it matters here. The moment he signs the extension, he's number 1 in the Trade Value ranking.  Jokic and Embiid are the same, I just forgot about Joel lol, they just have two years left, which concerns me, especially after the Kyrie fiasco, but yeah, these are the 4.  Steph, Kawhi and AD are all FA this season, so nothing there, LeBron is 36.  Harden isn't old but I think he'll decline the PO, so he'd be an expiring next season."
"The theory, in regards to day to day, is that he has had this for awhile and that the tear is so minor that it wouldn't be noticeable until a proper MRI happened. Kyle Neubeck [interviewed](https://www.phillyvoice.com/joel-embiid-torn-meniscus-injury-expert-doctor-medical-analysis-return-path-forward/) a local specialist who goes into more detail about all of it. While I do recognize the obvious potential for homer delusion here, it isn't out of the question for it to be true."
[Gives me flashbacks to Joel Embiid](https://youtu.be/UXcSPV29Pik)
"I think part of it is that Embiid has come a long way in that department, whereas AD has mainly stayed the same. There used to be reports of Embiid having a terrible diet, and he received a lot of criticism for generally not doing what he needs to do to stay on the court. So basically it seems Embiid went from [bad ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportscasting.com/76ers-star-joel-embiid-used-to-have-the-worst-junk-food-filled-diet/%3famp) to okay, whereas AD has always been at an okay level when it comes to physiological maintenance. So I think Embiids improvement leads to less criticism, even though he simply improved from bad to okay(so realistically he should be criticized all the same as AD, since you could argue they’re at about the same level in terms of general maintenance). You know what I mean?"
"They wouldn't dare to simply use Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan and Nick Claxton to guard him, and we're getting robbed of Joel Embiid potentially killing all three men. maybe we'll see Jokic show them why they need a center."
It’s a bad take period. Jokic averaged 26.4 10.8 and 8.3 assts. Joel averaged 28.5 10.6 and 2.8. I think those 6 assists a game safely place him above Embiid. Not to mention Murray’s injury. It’s just ridiculous for anyone to try undercut Jokic’s season. There are more numbers to support Jokic as well but it’s just super obvious who the MVP is this season.
"These Hawks fans really feeling themselves rn. They're about to run into Joel ""reality"" Embiid."
Its Joel Embiid. Hate to break it to you but hes day to day everyday.
JOEL EMBIID
"I could definitely see it being a competitive 6-7 game series going either way without Embiid, but Hawks in 5 is pretty spicy. This team even without Embiid is still much better than the Knicks, we still kept the 1 seed even when Joel went down for that big stretch during the middle of the year.  If we have Embiid, we will probably win in 4 or 5."
yes with joel embiid
"I'm with Shaq.  If the 76ers don't have Joel Embiid for the series, Trae Young takes it in 5."
Daaaaamn I’m liking this respect from the TNT crew right now “Hawks in 5” without Joel Embiid.   Probably means we’re gonna lose in 4 of course.
"Hear me out, Lakers sign Curry, Joel Embiid and Kevin Durant in the off season. Now that's a team Lebron could lead to a championship....."
"2011 happened, the series vs Dwight happened, Vs Prime Ben Wallace happened, Vs Joel Embiid Happened, 2021 vs Ayton Happened"
"1. Sorry I didn't mean high volume currently, I meant he would need to in our system around Ben and Jo 2. He was during the playoffs for sure, but this season he was the lead man on the Heat and got absolutely crushed. My issue is that creators like that can be streaky and that's fine, but if we're running an offense through Joel Embiid, you need to be able to score outside of the paint at a high clip more consistently than not, because otherwise we lose all momentum. If you took Jimmy + Seth and an elite 4 who can shoot at 42%, I'd like Butler. But that's the issue, you need a 4 who can shoot lights out or you're donezo.  Replacing Green with Butler straight up, IMO, increases our ceiling but lowers our floor, Green's threes this season have been back-breakers for opposing teams making a comeback."
"DeAndre Ayton is not worth the same money as Luka Doncic or Trae Young, sorry. He's performing well against a garbage Lakers front-court. In reality his offense is abysmal and his defense/rebounding is marginally above average.  Joel Embiid has offense. KAT has offense. Ayton is not even close."
I always think about Bill Laimbeer trying to defend Joel Embiid. No chance
"If Embiid stays healthy for the series, Atlanta will have a hell of a time trying to get the screens to work for Trae. Embiid is such a versatile defender, switches onto Young won't burn him. And he is someone Capela has to stay active on, Capela was basically a blocking and rebounding pylon during the Knicks series.   Taj Gibson and Nerlens Noel is a far cry from Dwight Howard and Joel Embiid. Atlanta need a HUGE boost from secondary point production to pull ahead in the series. Philly will not run out of good guards to throw against Young. I wanna say that Collins and Hunter will have to step up offensively, maybe get Bogdan some good looks from 3 and hopefully Lou will pulls out 6MOTY caliber performances in this series."
Because Ben steps up when Joel is out? I can’t hype Ben’s performance without wanting to trade Embiid?
"It's a problem that seems pretty unique to the NBA. Like nobody complained about a Tampa Bay vs Kansas City super bowl, but it seems like the NBA is obsessed with large markets. I think it comes down to the fact that your average NBA consumer knows who Lebron, Curry, KD, etc. are and as a result are more likely to tune in, but might not be as interested in like Donovan Mitchell vs Joel Embiid"
"One is the best defender in the league, the other is Joel Embiid"
"That’s more basketball iq. You can have a high basketball iq without being a playmaker e.g. KD, Klay or even Joel embiid. Wouldn’t call them playmakers but they know the mismatch and know what play to make whether it’s the extra pass or going up to score. They aren’t the ones who create/make the play but they can continue the play."
Trae Young is like a slightly meaner Joel Embiid.
"Anybody saying this didn’t watch the series that closely because he was not the reason they lost. The reason they lost was because of defense, poor 3 point shooting, and going against arguably the best Center in Joel Embiid. He had a good series, the game that dragged down his efficiency numbers to a really bad level was a game that they won. They played 5 games this series and I would say Russ played well in at least games 3,4, and 5 and I would argue he played fine in game 1 as well. He was good for 60-80% of the games this series. These grand declarations after a 5 game series are stupid. People didn’t do them with Jimmy Butler and they shouldn’t do it with Russ. Keep your takes consistent."
If karma is real Joel Embiid will be ready to go for game 1 lol
"This is why I'll never regard him as a top 5 player, unfortunately. He easily has the ability, but ability don't mean shit if you're not on the court.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  CP3. Blake Griffin. McGrady. Grant Hill. Brandon Roy. Joel Embiid a newcomer to that list."
Wizards fans you’ll always have that game 4 win against NO Joel Embiid. Cherish.
I can’t believe the basketball gods took Joel Embiid trolling the hawks next round away from me
yeah. i don’t get the premise of this post.    what’s the point of experimenting with a team that’s “built around ben simmons” when joel embiid is always going to be on the team — assuming he stays reasonably happy?   i just don’t understand this type of thought process lol.
Joel Embiid's potential is much higher than ADs.   AD is great but Embiid is going to be one of the NBAs biggest what if stories. Dude is an absolute monster when healthy
Joel Embiid who? We have Tyrese Maxey
How realistic is it that Joel Embiid is able to return this postseason and when would that be??
It was about how they got injured. Saying Joel Embiid is more important to his team than James Wiseman isn't a big shocking secret.
"Joel ""Casual Outfit"" Embiid"
Joel 'street clothes' Embiid
&gt; Matisse Thybulle starts for Joel Embiid. Sixers going small with Ben Simmons at center.  &gt; Could certainly see some zone and/or a lot of switching with that group.[&gt;](https://twitter.com/rich_hofmann/status/1400220110397263874?s=20)  Curious about that.
Invest in cybernetic technology and build Joel Embiid into the cyborg he was destined to be.
Joel Embiid expected to miss 2-3 weeks after being within 300 miles of the injury
"Joel ""Street Clothes"" Embiid"
Joel tore his meniscus on his other knee four years ago.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2699501-joel-embiid-reportedly-very-likely-to-undergo-surgery-on-meniscus-tear-in-knee
Close. It should be:  1) Kevin Durant 2) James Harden 3) Steph Curry 4) Joel Embiid 5) Giannis Antetokounmpo
"Aged like milk my dear casual nephew   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard"
"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
"Giannis reminds me of Embiid with his love for 3s. There was a time when Joel put way too many up too. Your coach has to get on you about that shit, Brown was getting a lot of shit too when he couldn't get his star player to stop shooting 3s. Regardless, they've had problems for a minute, long before Giannis was shooting this badly in the postseason."
"And we would not care, we would be talking about the fact that Joel Embiid has a ring for decades."
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
"i don't agree though, because you can't get fmvp when the other team wins, therefore Joel Embiid would win it"
"Shaq was bigger and stronger, yes. But Embiid is in better shape than Shaq was which enables him to be a more effective defender against spread offenses.  I don’t think you realize that saying “Shaq only plays defense in the postseason” is a flaw of Shaq relative to Joel.   Shaq was a 50% free throw shooter. Embiid is an 80% free throw shooter. They draw a similar amount of fouls. That kinda matters. It also matters that Embiid is, again, shooting like Dirk from mid range and above league average from three. He can co-exist fine with Ben Simmons because of this shooting ability. Shaq is more restricted in who he can play with to maximize his value and it’s not a coincidence that his most successful runs came next to a dynamic scoring *and* playmaking guard such as Kobe, Wade and Penny.  Saying that Embiid only looks so good because nobody can match him is idiotic. He’s just good."
"Embiid has a rather ridiculous foul drawing rate, so uh I think Shaq would have his issues on the other end as well.  Shaq can punish anybody, yeah. This version of Joel can too. Again - he’s shooting like Dirk from mid range and hitting free throws at a higher clip than most guards. This isn’t something you can guard."
Joel Embiid is the fucking man.
"He would be amazing. This is why I think it is wrong when people say the bigman is dead. The bigman was dead for a while just because there wasn't any good bigmen in the league. If Dwight Howard didn't exist, people would have been saying the bigman is dead in the late 2000's after Yao Ming injury. The bigman got good again when good bigmen entered the league like Joel Embiid, Giannis, Jokic, Gobert, and Bam."
"Here's the TLDR:  Embiid is 27. In his entire life, he has only played basketball of *any* kind for about 10 1/2 years.  4 of those years he was an NBA all star  1 of those years he's the leading MVP candidate  oh and 2 of those years dude was hurt.  Joel is a basketball savant."
Joel Embiid could hit me in the face with a shovel and I’d apologize. I love this man so much
Chivalry 2 needs a Joel Embiid-sized character model
[https://projects.theplayerstribune.com/joel-embiid-the-only-way-is-through/p/1](https://projects.theplayerstribune.com/joel-embiid-the-only-way-is-through/p/1)  &amp;#x200B;  This one is really good too.
"I'm 28, for context.   I haven't had as much fun rooting for any singular Philadelphia athlete in my lifetime since Brian Dawkins. Joel Embiid is an absolute treasure"
I honestly highly doubt it. I think he's going to be a good player but an MVP candidate? As a non playmaking big? In this day and age? Gonna be really hard. He's essentially gotta turn into Joel Embiid
"Yes, LeBron James literally attempted to paralyze Joel Embiid."
"I think a Sixers / Jazz finals would be the best fun for nearly everyone from a fan's standpoint.  ROY runner up Donovan Mitchell can do his best to try and score on DPOY runner up ROY winner Ben Simmons, while also DPOY Rudy Gobert can get his shot to slow down MVP runner up Joel Embiid.     Plenty of fun storylines all around."
Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris come close. Tobias only had 19 points in game 2 against the Wizards where he only played 23 minutes because the Sixers won by 25 and Joel got hurt in 4 of the Wizards series.
I domt really think so. There's not a center that Embiid will not abuse 1 on 1. It's the help coverage and the drop sets that defenses use that determines how well Embiid is guarded.   Brook isn't a bad defender at all but he will need a lot of help. Gianns will come over to help and we will swing the ball around and shoot the open shot. If we miss open 3s and floaters for the series we will go home and we will be okay with that. We aren't really worried about Joel minus injury concerns with his knee.

Embiid is 27 I thought? so yeah very close but they would be a tad younger than ben and joel.
Joel Embiid is pretty cool so that'd be fun
"We have all our picks. But yeah, we need a vet to help against guys like Embiid. Rob Williams just can not stop any Embiid face up. I’m hoping GMs note how good Kemba was the last 10ish games of the season and against the Wizards before the bone bruise that bothered him against the Nets. To contend with the Big 3 teams in the East the Celtics need that Kemba role filled and a second big who has solid matchups. I think most people would agree if Brown played the Celtics would have beat most of the non Big 3 teams in the East. That healthy Nets team was clowning the Bucks and before injuries, looked like a clean sweep. Not rooting for the Sixers, but I respect what they have done this year and have a few guys on their team I like to see do well. Plus if the Bucks lose, I wouldn’t be surprised if Joel averaged 50 against the Nets."
"Is Jokic really top 3? I know he won MVP, but is he really better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Joel Embiid, and Luka Doncic? I know I will get downvoted to hell for calling this out, but come on."
I was thinking more about the opportunity it might give our lord and savior Joel Hans Embiid time to rest the knee since this has to go at least 6 now. Don't really care which of the 2 we get in the ECF either one won't be easy.
This post reminds me of when Marc Gasol was a Joel Embiid stopper.   https://np.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/bjupmk/joel_embiid_points_per_100_possessions_while/
"Embiid is just an enormous matchup nightmare for the Nets. Of course, their guys are matchup nightmares for any team. But Joel getting 35-15 a night would be a real possibility."
"except for the mvp part, i completely agree with everything else, he's a great rim protector and he IS the jazz' defensive system, but he's not an amazing 1v1 defender aganist skilled and strong centers like embiid and joker (whereas gasol for example was an excellent 1v1 defender on joel)"
"OP said Embiid owns Giannis. We have no post season play between the two to compare so we must compare during the regular season. Not only does Giannis own the 76ers like no other team in the NBA, Joel consistently sucks playing against Milwaukee. I never said this would happen in the playoffs, I'm just refuting OP's ridiculous statement."
No he doesn't lmao.  Giannis has had only one bad game against the Sixers in the past 4 years. He abuses the Sixers.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/giannis-antetokounmpo-regular-season-game-stats-vs-76ers-last-3-seasons  Joel on the other hand ... yikes.  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-last-6-game-stats-vs-bucks
Quit acting like joel embiid isnt an oscar nominee
"All flop team:  C - Joel Embiid, PF - Lebron James, SF - James Harden, SG - Marcus Smart, PG - Trae Young, 6th Man - Kyle Lowry. Team goes 16-0 in the playoffs."
Aron Baynes has one single positive attribute to his play: He can slow down Joel Embiid. A contending team may trade/pick up Baynes just to have a reliable Embiid stopper on their roster.
"Embiid is hitting 49% of his mid range jumpers, 37% of his threes and shooting 86% from the line. More about all time level skill than era influence as Dwights main issues would persist even today.  You’re seeing in the Hawks series that traditional centers or not dont matter with Joel. He’s just become unguardable in a 1on1 situation now that his mid range jumper has become a legitimate counter move. How do you stop a guy shooting like Dirk from mid and causing problems like Shaq on the block? You kinda don’t. Capela is about as effective as wet tissue paper against him and this is a good defensive center.  Now, I’d agree that Dwight is better defensively. Certainly a lot more versatile as well. But when we’re talking about one of best offensive stretches ever for a big ego is also really good defensively himself I think he outclasses Dwight who was limited as a 1on1 creator."
"Sure - Dwight leading a finals team doesn’t make him better than players who haven’t. That should be common sense. Dwight did not face a team on par with the 19 Raptors or current Nets en route to the finals either.  Next, Embiid is in the middle of his peak season. You don’t know how it ends. What you do know is Dwight has never been as dominant as Joel is ‘21."
Yet the Sixers are 0-2 against the Suns this season.   Joel “Empty Stats” Embiid has a nice ring to it.
Joel Embiid.
"Yeah, but is Joel Embiid more valuable on the Bulls than Zach Lavine plus X player (joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Aaron Gordon, Tim Hardaway) is on the Bulls"
"This is a really easy fallacy to fall into because core stats aren't as scalable as impact metrics, but ultimately even if Zach is paid like a high end 6 man/ 3 and D Starter instead of an all star, the major all-NBA players in the league typically have impacts that are even higher than their max contracts (hence why the max exists, so there isn't a speculation war over if Lebron is worth 50 million or 70 million etc and you dont have a star surrounded by 10 PJ Tuckers).  Zach is on a relatively cheap contract but you have to pair that cheapness with oppurtunity cost of not having a higher paid but bonafide star. So if Joel Embiid makes $30 million and Zach makes 18 Million, the question youre asking is with Zach plus whichever player you can buy for $12 million = Joel Embiid. So is Zach Lavine plus Jae Crowder or plus Spencer Dinwiddie or plus Joe Harris better than Joel Embiid (no, but the Zach + Joe Harris seems close). Ultimately, no matter how much else you can buy due to Zachs cheaper contract, it will never equal 1 Joel Embiid, or Jokic, or Giannis or Harden or Lebron because their impact is scalable.  Also the impact metrics are still out on Levine as a primary ball handler and as a defender. This year was a revelation just shooting wise and the contract he gets will make this one look cheap, but, simultaneously, the contract he gets will over pay him for his impact"
This is why I think we have the best shot at the Nets. We have the defensive personnel to slow down their big 3 and they have basically 0 answer whatsoever for Joel Embiid
Joel Big Guy flopping Embiid and Ben can't shoot Simmons.
Joel Embiid makes Ngannou look small  https://youtu.be/o8BZX36eNp0
"his wife and possibly bryan colangelo himself operated a number of twitter accounts that was leaking private team information in petty arguments online.  It was very obvious they did not like the star player Embiid and trashed him along with Hinkie, they leaked medical details about a failed physical, and theres all kinds of meme tweets involving large collars and medium sized ladders.  It is a ridiculous rabbit hole to jump through.  One of them pretended to be a gay disabled parking attendant that knew Bryan Colangelo and said hello to him every day.  It's insanity.  This was all going on at the same time Fultz forgot how to shoot so the Sixers are just insanely bizarre.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz  this is the article that broke the story  after this all came out embiid tweeted at one of the burners claiming that Hinkie was a way better GM.  Its got so many layers."
they'd be getting those open looks regardless. joel Embiid

"Simmons is elite at literally everything except shooting past like 4 feet from the rim. His shooting isn’t *non-existent*, it just isn’t good so he doesn’t do it much. That makes him super polarizing - he’s SO good at literally everything else on the court, but there’s no denying his job and his team’s job is so much harder when he’s not a threat to score outside of around the rim.   To make it even more complex, he’s still young and is the number 2 option on his team behind Joel Embiid. When the team’s number 2 option isn’t a threat to score from anywhere else on the court except around the rim, then that means all the other teammates have to be lights out shooters."

1. Joel Embiid  2. Ben Simmons  3. Robert Covington  4. Dario Saric  5. TJ McConnell
"What about dame? If you sign dame for the vet min as a ring chase, then you can trade kuzma for Joel embiid. With the size of AD’s labia, you need a true center. Then get KD as a 6th man and your good 👍"
"interesting...  I think your second round seems right to me, but that means:  \- Suns have LeBron and Jokic  \- Clippers have Luka and I think Gobert (over Ja)  \- Sixers have Beal and Trae (over Randle)  \- Nets have Tatum and Giannis  I say the Suns and Nets win. So my WCF champ would be the suns:  C Nikola Jokic  PF LeBron James  SF Kawhi Leonard  SG Devin Booker  PG Chris Paul  vs the ECF Champ, the Nets  C Joel Embiid  PF Giannis Antetokounmpo  SF Kevin Durant  SG James Harden  PG Kyrie Irving  6th man: Jayson Tatum  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Suns actually win with their playmaking, but thats a clash of the titans - especially with the the front court scoring and back court defense of the Nets."
"The two biggest differences that catapulted the Sixers from the second tier in the East to the top was 1. Embiid learning to handle and pass out of doubles/triples and 2. His teammates knocking down shots.  Go back just a couple years and the real big difference is Joel couldn’t handle the pressure of the double teams and would constantly turn the ball over and when he did pass out of it Dario, Covington, etc weren’t consistent enough to make teams pay.  I’m trying not to look past the Hawks but I really hope they let KD and Ben go at it next round and don’t call ticky tack shit."
Joel “jokić” Embiid
The Joel Embiid method
Embiid and jokic offensively is clearly level  Embiid vs jokic defensively isn't even close  If Joel doesn't get hurt he gets the MVP award
Joel Embiid is the best basketball player on the planet.
Whose having a harder time: Joel Embiid getting to the rim or a mosquito getting to Trae’s scalp?
I love Joel Embiid. My MVP.
One team has Joel Embiid. The other team has Khris Middleton. As a huge fan of Middleton's game this still seems like an important distinction.
"This one time I was in Philly for work, you know. I was sitting on some bench in some ruff part of Philly eating a Cheese Steak in full Celtics gear. Outta nowhere these two dudes decided to mug me. They whipped out some small wooden club calling it a ""shelaylay"". The one dude some 7' behemoth takes the ""shelaylay"" from his tiny friend, and I mean tiny guy, I'm 5'10 and I look like this Andre the Giant dude next to him. Anyway, they start clubbing me. The tall guy clubs me in the head and I'm bleeding BAD. My left eye is covered in blood and I can't see shit. I'm hurtin BAD and these guys are asking me to hand over my wallet and other valuables. I'm pleading for my life tryin not to die, and outta nowhere, who helps me? Joel Embiid. He palms the head of each of the comically sized would-be duo and conks their heads together, knocking them out. Embiid reaches his hand out towards me like he was gunna help me. He begins to pull me up then outta nowhere he sucker punches me and says ""Drop the confetti now!"""
Joel Embiid is four years older than everyone thinks
I like both Joel Embiid and Trae Young.

I hate Trae Young just a tiny bit more than I hate Joel Embiid  I'm a Knicks fan by birth
"Joul-baiter  Joel ""Hans-off-me"" Embiid   Workshopping some ideas here, but it's tough..."
Says the guy with Joel Embiid on his team?
*puts on wig and lipstick and heads to the 76ers locker room*  Looks like its up to me to win this for Atlanta.  *Joel Embiid out for second half with strained groin*
"But all Cs have hands all over them in the post, only one of them gets calls all the time. Non-Embiid bigs are officiated really differently from perimeter players, the difference is Joel gets a perimeter player whistle because he sells like a perimeter player"
Unlike Joel Embiid who gets 10 fta per game?

lmao this dude joel embiid
"embiid would defend him bettwr than most cause he is huge and athletic too but shaq would still score at his usual rate (maybe a bit less efficient than vs the average center)   and embiid would pick Up fouls quickly so the matchup wouldnt be a good idea full game  on the other half, embiid pick and pop and drives would hurt shaq drop coverage defense  shaq cannot just leave embiid open cause Joel is actually a great shooter, that would make him a less effective defender than defneding the rim or post 1vs 1  overall both would score a los, but shaq would do more amd force embiid to foul him more  however embiid would be the better defender of the tal  overall shaq still comes ahead"
"It doesn’t mean it’s holding him back. Is Luka held back by his emotions? Is Joel Embiid? Is Jokic? No. They’re all capable of displaying emotion and still being top-tier players. There’s like literally two guys in the league who don’t display emotion, and it’s Kawhi Leonard and Kendrick Nunn lmao."
He’s buried next to Joel Embiid.
Peak Shaq was easily the most dominant player I've ever seen. [This](https://youtu.be/F5BgYiegnm8) is what Shaq did to the DPOY Dikembe Mutombo in the 01 Finals. Shaq was ruthless and would absolutely destroy Joel Embiid
Joel Hans Embiid
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
"I think the Sixers match up pretty well without Harden playing. Ben guards KD, Thybulle guards Kyrie, plus Embiid in the middle with Danny Green as a help defender. That’s about a solid a matchup defensively you can have for the Nets.  Offensively - do the nets have anyone that can guard Joel?"
"And that was one of the things that Embiid apparently didn't like about Lue. [X's and O's and the fact that he was a ""Simmons guy"" because of the Rich Paul connection.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2923618-report-joel-embiid-opposed-ty-lue-as-76ers-hc-over-ben-simmons-ties-xs-os)"
"Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard are all better so no. I would say Jokic is better too. Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic have a great argument too."
Now do Joel Embiid. His are probably just as bad if not worse.
"This is hard because of the 1st team SF line up....I wanted to put LeBron, but then there's KD.

We literally have Embiid in Philly… If dame wants to play with Joel he could just demand a trade to Philly….
"That may be true, but the chances of AD getting injured on some play in the playoffs is very high.  He's probably more injury prone than Joel Embiid (who really would have been another Greg Oden if he had come into the league even 5 years earlier)."
"&gt;Matisse Thybulle- 2021. A bench player for the Philadelphia 76ers that already Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, he was good but not really All-Defense. He played only 20 mpg.   He literally might have been the best defensive player on the sixers roster"
That last sentence is the main point to me. You can mimic their production easier than any other player so unless it's Joel embiid or joker or kat the money isn't worth it. Constant 4 year rookie deals at center will help better
Joel Embiid with the 11’ wingspan
"&gt; Matisse Thybulle- 2021. A bench player for the Philadelphia 76ers that already Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, he was good but not really All-Defense. He played only 20 mpg.   NO"
"&gt;Matisse Thybulle- 2021. A bench player for the Philadelphia 76ers that already Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, he was good but not really All-Defense. He played only 20 mpg.  Anyone who watch Thybulle for those 20min knows how special he is on defense. Pat Bev 2020 is worse than him"

"He played through that meniscus injury against Atlanta. Dude wasn’t at 100% which he confirmed himself but still was the biggest thread on the floor. I mean when Capela fouled out most of the time Atlanta was fucked pretty hard. Okongwu though was not unplayable in the matchup which was huge for the Hawks.    Anyways, I think we have never seen Philly with healthy Embiid and a performing squad around him except in 2019 - which you said yourself was decided by 1 shot. And Joel got better since then.     I think a championship is not likely in the next couple years and this year was pretty much their best chance looking at the competition which will only get better the next couple years (Upcoming stars improve further, Nets next year hopefully healthy, MIL still MIL, …) but just by the pure talent that Embiid has plus his work ethic and willingness to improve, I wouldn’t rule out their chances."
"Dame Lillard has more years on his contract than Joel Embiid.  And if Sixers management show they are loyal to Ben Simmons and refuse to get rid of him, well, then they've made a decision about who to build the team around, right ?"
"Idk, he hasn't lived up to being #4 but this thing is a crap shoot. 2013 was Anthony Bennett/Victor Oladipo/Otto Porter/Cody Zeller. 2014 was Andrew Wiggins/Jabari Parker/Joel Embiid/Aaron Gordon. Alex Len and Dante Exum were the #5s those years. You obviously hope to get a franchise-altering guy in the top 10 (especially top 4), but really you're praying to avoid a bust. An above average role player historically isn't bad for a Top-10 pick."
"Philadelphia is promising to pay Ben Simmons around $140m over the next four years.  Any team that takes over his contract also needs to pay this.  At the same time, Philly arent trying very hard to actually trade him, and indeed are making offers that other teams are making public so people can laugh at them.  The question we should be asking is 'Does what Philly is doing to Joel Embiid justify him acting like Harden and forcing a trade ?'"

Interesting that you didn’t mention drafting Joel Embiid. That was a home run.   Dario Saric was also in the same draft and he was used to trade for Jimmy Butler.
"The league was unhappy with Sam Hinkie running the Sixers in the ""Trust the Process"" era, so they leaned on the Sixers to hire Jerry Colangelo as a consultant.

"All he said was that Beal would have better odds of winning a chip with Joel Embiid than the Wizards.   You can’t really argue with that, odds that Wizards win a chip in the next 5 years are about as good as the odds of Dan Snyder selling the WFT"

"Daryl Morey texted Joel Embiid after the third or fourth team he called with, ""We're trading Ben."" Then, after the ninth team hung up laughing, Morey texted Embiid: ""Gonna get so much."" After the Sixers failed to make a trade, Morey texted a big-brain emoji."
Toronto should counter offer with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid for a stick of bubblegum and the contents of [this mystery box.](https://youtu.be/XsNIFD7TxwU)
I would re do 5-9 to be:   .5. Wiggins  .6. Kyrie Irving  .7. Cade Cunningham  .8. Joel Embiid  .9. Jabari Parker  and then maybe raise Mobley a little but other than that I think your list is solid.
"Soo, what am I missing here? What’s so good about that offer from GSW side? Two future 1s, that will be pick 27 or later? Andrew Wiggins? Two lottery picks this year that don’t do shit to help Joel Embiid?   What are we doing here?"
"Shamet has played for four different teams in his first four years.  He has played with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Devin Booker, and possibly Chris Paul."
"If you need that kind of talent around him, how good is Ben actually? Even aggressive, freight-train, no-Embiid Ben averaged 15.5/8/6.6 (https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=ben+simmons+stats+without+joel+embiid+game+log+2020-21).   16 games isn't a giant sample size, but that indicates he's at about the same level of production as his career averages. That Utah game sticks in the memory, but he only had 4 games over 20 pts in those Embiid-less games, with 3 in the single digits."
"Unless this ""package that included Simmons"" also included Joel Embiid, all the other FOs are going to get really insulted by Morey treating them like they're stupid."
"And they were horrible on purpose for 3 years after getting Joel and got Okafor, Simmons, and Fultz   and nobody but Embiid is on the team from that train fire"
Can you imagine if Joel Embiid was the one being traded?
"First off, you can have this conversation without being an asshole. Second, you're discrediting the role players and secondary stars in the league by acting like their skills aren't important- they are still among the best basketball talents in the world. Any bench point guard in the NBA is gonna be a vastly superior ballhandler to Embiid, way better at chasing guards around the perimeter and over screens, and most are much better shooters and passers. Those are all really important basketball skills, and you need someone on the floor who can do those things or you'll get wrecked. A team of 15 Joel Embiids would be great on the glass and at defending the rim, but the offense would be all post-ups with no spacing (a horrible combination) and the defense would give up easy threes to guards running off screens every time down the floor. Does that sound like a title team to you?"
Joel Embiid should demand a trade right now. 76ers have no chance of making the ECF with Simmons and Doc Rivers
5’10 white dude so joel embiid
"Absolutely. The Sixers ended up with Joel Embiid. Simple as that. And with him, they'll be contending for a decade."
"Simmons for Butler  Simmons is friends with Bam Adebayo through discord, and that gives Miami a longer window to try to build some type of contender as Simmons is more in line age wise with Bam and Herro. It’s unlikely Miami can build a team to beat the Nets, so it’s best to move on.  For Butler he gets to more seriously compete for a championship with his friend Joel Embiid with some nice shooters around them."
"&gt;“Do we think this group can make it out of the East?” If the answer is no then you should certainly try to re-tool the team.  But what if the answer is ""no"" for the new theoretical team after a trade? Then why bother doing the trade?  Ben is 25 and under team control until 2025 (which takes us through Embiid's age 31 season). I know the relationship PhDs here on /r/nba insist that the relationship between him and the Sixers is over, but that's a call that Daryl Morey has much more of a window into than we do. If the goal is to have the best possible team around Joel Embiid through his prime, the answer very well might be to keep Ben if they aren't seeing enough good deals.  The ship has sailed on correcting past mistakes (like the clearing out of assets done by Colangelo and Brand). The current roster around Embiid is what it is, and if the hypothetical version of the Sixers after a trade isn't better for producing a title during Embiid's prime, then there's no point in doing it. And I don't think trading Ben for a non-star and a small package of picks that also can't get a star will improve the Sixers' title chances."
1) Kevin Durant 2) Giannis 3) Lebron James 4) Steph Curry 5) James Harden 6) Luka Doncic 7) Nikola Jokic 8) Damian Lillard 9) Anthony Davis 10) Joel Embiid
That was the wrap on them for the past few seasons because they never had a closer on the team. Joel Embiid became that person (hence 2nd in MVP voting) this year
"I’m really glad that Joel Embiid will finally get a chance to play with proper floor spacing. He is an amazing player, he has worked so damn hard on his game, and you can see how emotionally invested he is.   Without Mona Lisa trying to run the dribble dribble offense this year, Philly has a GREAT chance to win a title."
"The problem with this is that Embiid is done with Simmons.  If Philly keep Simmons, there's a terrible risk of Joel not signing his extension."
"Say Simmons ends up going to Portland for CJ McCollum and, I don't know, two firsts?   Philly them have those two picks, their own 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 first round picks (2025 to OKC), and young pieces in Thybulle, Maxey and Milton, along with salary matcher in Tobias Harris, to send to, for example, Washington to get Beal.  CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal and Joel Embiid is probably a better championship base than Simmons, Harris and Embiid."
Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid were absolutely and completely correct to say what they did about Ben Simmons.  Their answers were 100% kosher.  And they both know that a championship team is one that does not have Ben Simmons on it.
"Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers fucked the situation up by publicly handing Ben Simmons ass to him.  Like, smooth moves guys. If he's traded, your team probably got less back because you helped tank his value. And if he isn't traded, now you have to play with a guy you publicly blamed for your playoff series loss for another season."
I see your idea but that's a major downgrade considering The age difference between Simmons on those two guys.  Besides with your best player in Joel embiid . You wouldn't want a mid-range shooter like DeMar  You'd want to give Joelle as much space as possible
"No, Ben Simmons is still coasting on the max you guys gave him, when he promised he'd learn how to shoot and make free throws.  But. If Simmons became a 60% free throw shooter and developed a running floater and a few post moves, would you pay him a supermax at Philly, knowing that means you can't give one to Joel Embiid ?  Of course you fucking wouldn't, and neither would any sane GM.  If Simmons improves - and he hasnt since he entered the league - he's worth a max contract. Which is what he's being paid now.  Enjoy him staying in Philly, or saying goodbye to actual assets !"
"Run. It. Back. Forever.   Simmons was mvp for the hawks in the postseason. I don't think they pull it off without Simmons.  Putting another year of wear on embiid, getting to play against Simmons for at least another year... Yes. Bad for Joel but so so so nice for the rest of the east.   Please run it back."
Give Ingram a shitty Eastern conference and Joel Embiid and he might change that. If Simmons was a great piece that helped your team truly win then you wouldn't be trading him. Simmons currently isn't worth his contract and the interest around him is about teams (like mine) hoping they can push him to develop his offensive game.
"Knicks  Frank Ntilikina for Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Thybulle"
"If I'm Joel embiid and all we get for Simmons is fucking draft picks after how many years of ""trust the process"" no way am I staying in philly"
thats cause of Joel Embiid being so dominant. Simmons wasn't doing anything of use
The offer Philly asked for Spurs must surely have thought it was for Joel Embiid
Yeah but wouldn't it be fun to see Jimmy Buckets play in Philadelphia alongside Joel Embiid? I could only imagine what that would look like
Bam is not Joel Embiid and Herro is not JJ Reddick
"That team needs to be a top 3 seed for that guy to win MVP. In the East, I think most people agree that unless some serious injuries to occur the Bucks, 76ers or the Nets are going to be the top 3 seeds. The only real wildcard is the 76ers with Ben Simmons trade possibilities and Joel Embiid injury history. So, there’s one potential spot open, and the most likely team is the Hawks sneaking in. So, Trae Young can be that dark horse MVP in the East.  In the West it’s more interesting and the most likely dark horse MVP is coming from there. I think there are a couple of candidates like Devin Booker who could get a lot of serious consideration if the Suns finish as the Nr. 1 team; Paul George if the Clippers end as a top 3 seed without Kawhi.  And there are the “Are they really a dark horse if everyone knows them?” In Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. I think if the Lakers finish as a top 3 seed and we see Anthony Davis putting monster numbers without LeBron and carrying the team you could see a lot of buzz for MVP. Damian Lillard if he stays with the Blazers and they are a top 3 seed you could see a lot narrative in his favour for staying with the Blazers, being loyal and deserving MVP for guiding his team from the 6th seed to the 3rd seed in the Wild Wild West."
"Look, that Toronto offer of FVV, OG and a future first isn't sexy but I think it's one of the best that the 76ers will get.  For all of Ben's faults offensively, he does two massively important things for the team: playmaking and guarding the opponent's best player.   The issue with trading Ben is that his value isn't enough to get a single star (or stars) that can do both of those effectively. Especially if they were able to get the hail-mary of Damian Lillard, they're still going to have a giant hole at small forward that can't be replaced easily.  Neither FVV or OG are stars, but they're definitely above-average starters who together provide the playmaking and defense that Ben provides. Hopefully together they provide more of an offensive punch than Ben does currently. I think Seth Curry would be traded since a backcourt with him and FVV is a little suspect.  But, a lineup of FVV/Thybulle/OG/Tobias/Embiid is nasty and would allow you to maximize Embiid. There's obviously a concern of not having a true second star next to Joel but I think we're all past the point of expecting that Simmons will get you another one in return.   I'm a little confused on why Toronto would try for this trade but if they're able to draft Suggs to replace FVV at the point then you're good to go."
"Trae wasn't eliminated in an early round. Also generally stars are those who get the most calls partly because they're the ones who actually have the ball.  So you can't compare 225 players because there usage is radically different.  So if you look at players and their rankings. there nothing about Trae FTA from others that stands out. So the particular criticism of Trae foul-baiting is more a meme with no substance. because literally 90% of stars are foul baiting.     So in the post season FTA  1. Joel Embiid 9.9 2.

Joel Embiid would get some Hakeem Olajuwon ceiling projections and he's the closest thing we have to a modernized Dream.
"The Bucks are well positioned in my opinion, but there are some teams that they'll need to look out for just in the East alone.  The Nets are the obvious ones next year, but KD, Kyrie *and* Harden all have player options in the next off-season I believe. The 76ers may have had a problem with Ben Simmons, but Joel Embiid is the real deal.  If they figure out what they are doing with Ben and Joel stays healthy (the biggest if for Philly), you have a rival for a while.  Then the West is what it always is, a bloodbath."
Hot take: Trae Young and Joel Embiid take a step back this year in production. More so Young than Embiid though
"Players do it all the time  Joel Embiid- ""The Process""  Anthony Davis- ""Fear the Brow""  Jeremy Lin- ""Linsanity""  Kevin Durant- ""Durantula""  Pat Riley- ""Threepeat""  Shits definitely got a corny feel to it. But it makes total sense. And even if they don't feel like directly making money from it themselves they can license out the term for others to use in merchandise sales."
"Nice of you to talk about Nerlens Noel in such high regard, but I think you forgot about Joel Embiid"
So what? Chris bosh scored 0 points in a game 7. Joel Embiid scored 0 points against the raptors in 2019. Its just one bad game
Point center Joel hanz embiid
"In Morey delusional mind he would have the 4th pick as well,                                                so in lala land his starting 5 would be...  Jalen Suggs, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid."
Joel Embiid would get triple teamed in the post
"OG is definitely a better all round defender, long overdue for an all defensive selection although there always seems to be something random impacting his selection be it injury or media profile preferring more famous guys. I'm not arguing otherwise. I would say that i'd much prefer Thybulle to guard 1s and 2s over screens when the center is in drop coverage. Yes this is a very specific set of circumstances but its very common to see drop coverage these days and guys who can get over those screens and get back to the the guards are extremely valuable. OG is a very good screen navigator for a guy as big as he is but there are certain limitations to his body type, the same going for guys like Lebron and Kawhi these days. Amazing players for switch all schemes though.  &gt;If you read the second part of that sentence. You’d see that I said the next 50 is much more skewed to bench players. That’s around 35  I still don't really get this. Thybulle guarded the primary ball handler most of the time he was on the court, except for very specific matchups (Dame/Luka/Russ/Donovan) where Thybulle was either not playing or Philly had very specific schemes for those players which warranted the use of Ben in those matchups (for what its worth Clarkson was always more of a threat vs the 6ers than Donovan).  The Sixers played plenty of  games without Simmons (14), and those were the games where people really got to see the most out of Thybulle. Conditioning has never been an issue with him, its only his offence that limits his minutes (and foul trouble in his first year), he had plenty of games with +30 minutes played and never struggled with the load.  Joel was really good defensively this year but we also played a scheme that lets guards run wild quite a bit, Phoenix had a huge mix of coverages that were usually a lot more aggressive on ball, be it with or without Aayton. You also may want to check your facts. [Aayton was definitely closing in the majority of games](https://go.nba.com/air3).  I really don't understand what you're trying to prove here. Thybulle played amazing defence vs a whole range of guards, from all stars to bench spark plugs. He was also a wizard in the passing lanes and put had jump shooters fearing him because he can pop out of nowhere and block shots when players least expected it. The success of Philly's drop coverage schemes hinged on Dwight and Embiid not having to hedge high because Simmons/Thybulle both were fanstastic POA defenders.  Defensive teams are weird to pick because there's only 10 spots for 30 teams and realistically most teams have a few people contributing to make them successful on that end, not just 1 guy (sorry Rudy). It's very rare that 2 guards make it from one team, especially since we had multiple contributors, but its not impossible, and Matisse was clearly deserving of consideration. Whether or not he should have made it is open for debate but it wasn't some legacy selection like Kobe used to get, he's a legitimate all defensive caliber guy playing in an era thats made it harder and harder to guard aggressively through screens like he has to do. Dejounte Murray made the team playing 21 minutes a game in 2018 *because he was an outstanding defender* and Matisse just happens to fit that same mould."
"&gt;20/50s of thybulle’s most guarded players by playing time were not starters  So you're saying he mostly guarded starters...  As well as primary bench ball handlers like Burks/Clarkson/TJ  &gt; Thybulles 10 longest assignments were...  There's an availability issue here. Philly is in the East, there's less quality guards in the east.  Don't really see what the point of comparing him to OG is when OG is a forward and Thybulle is a guard. Thybulle can't guard Randle, but OG would struggle vs a guy like Fox.  &gt; I’m not impressed by someone who comes out to play defence on second tier players for only 20 minutes a game when you have two DPOY level players sharing the court  Completely gross exaggeration. Matisse played 712 minutes this year without Ben or Joel, and Philly was still elite on that end (105 DRTG).  The hardest job in the modern NBA is guarding elite ball handlers while in drop coverage. Thybulle does that better than anyone save for Jrue Holiday, and Jrue was the deserving first team guard. Philly played a scheme that demanded elite point of attack defence, or it would have crumbled like it did last year. This year thanks to Thybulle and Ben's improvements, Philly was 2nd in defence, and as opposed to normal it wasn't Embiid doing the heavy lifting.  As I mentioned I would have had no problem with Bridges making the team, but you may want to compare the %s of how those star players shot against Bridges and against Thybulle. Thybulle absolutely destroyed some of the best scoring guards in the league (Lavine 20%, Fox 36%, Booker 27%, Beal 30%), whereas Bridges who also had an elite caliber defensive center alongside him, was simply not as effective."
Elfrid Payton   Markelle Fultz   TJ McConnell   Ben Simmons   Joel Embiid
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
"&gt;How much do you think Lowry is worth at 35 years old demanding a 3/90 contract?   Lowry's worth is really dependent on the team. To a team like the Clippers, he has quite a bit of value. To a team like the Cavs, maybe not.   For the Sixers, I honestly thought he was an excellent value for you guys. He was no guarantee of a chip, but he absolutely would have helped increase the *odds* of winning one. Put it this way, did the Bucks or their fans honestly think Jrue Holiday would have been the difference maker to win a chip. I suspect most would say no. But they all would have agreed that Holiday was an upgrade and would have helped increase the possibility of winning one.   &gt;Joel is 27  And Embiid is injury prone. And he was having an MVP season. You and I will differ on this, I'm sure, but I dont think Embiids prime will last that long. Hence it made sense to me to go all in when the odds looked good.  &gt;we didn't need to give up the farm and ruin all of our flexibility for a fucking 35 year old literally looking for his last payday  And the funny thing about this is that, if you honestly believe that Embiid is young and has a long future ahead of you, why *not* take the risk? Lowry performs realy well and you make the ECF or Finals. With luck even win it all. He performs decently and you guys have an asset to trade. He doesn't perform at all and you buy him out or he becomes an expiring that can be traded. It was hardly a situation of messing up the salary really badly. I never got what the hesitation was."
Thats a package for joel embiid not the guy who won't dunk the ball when wide open
"Hindsight is always 20/20 but people never really think about the time. You can’t say Joel Embiid was the better pick back then so context actually does matter.   No one would’ve picked Giannis first back in 2013, the raptors tried to trade up a bit but he wasn’t the caliber the top picked guys were supposed to be."
"This is what happens when you're a sharp shooter who played with prime Dwight Howard, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, and Joel Embiid"
It’s not even a feels thing. They literally did lol. Joel embiid called him out the game they got eliminated and basically said it was his fault they lost lol. Not exactly something you want to here *publicly* from a team mate.
This is the Joel Embiid-Rihanna debacle all over again
Joel Embiid is not winning DPOY lmao
"It is a big deal, the Pistons’ situation is just not comparable to the 76ers’.  Pistons aren’t competing for a championship anytime soon and and pretty much have Cade for the next 8 years regardless.  The 76ers have a prime Joel Embiid with 2 years left under contract on a deal that was less favorable than the one Ben Simmons signed (Joel wasn’t given the same escalators for making the rookies supermax like Ben).  The Sixers have every reason to be in win now mode."
Joel Embiid
"He’s Bahamian and has played with their team in FIBA  Joel Embiid has never played for his national team. Technically, he could get American citizenship and join Team USA"
"In other news, water is wet and Joel Embiid has tits"
Yea he’s not a vocal leader that’s why I didn’t include him. I forgot Joel Embiid he fits the description as well
Joel Embiid is probably the best center in the league (Jokic could be argued over him) and he was developed almost entirely in the American system.
"I hate TS so much. While yes trae went from 58.9% TS in the regular season to 53.9 TS% vs Philly a 5% difference in the playoffs does not mean shit. Joel Embiid went from 63 TS% in the regular season to 58 TS% vs Atlanta, does that mean that  Clint Capela was locking up embiid because he had a 5 TS% difference???  Also even if his efficiency was worse Trae went from averaging 9.4 assists on 4.1 turnovers to 10.9 assists on 3.6 turnovers so his playmaking got better even if his efficiency was done  Ben didnt do shit"
"Full text of tweet:   Kings‘ **Richaun Holmes** sits down with Stadium: Emerging as a starting C after being drafted behind Joel Embiid and others in Philly “These were starting centers...I feel like I’m competing against them off rip”, free agency **(Hornets, Mavs expected to pursue, per sources)**, more."
Didn't know Joel Embiid wasn't the best player on the team
"How I started really getting into NBA was following college stars into their NBA career and expanding my taste from there.   For you, along with the other suggestions, I would say to pick a player to follow. I don't know what kind of player would appeal to you but I can give some recommendations.  (I am going to preface this by saying most players I list are on the younger side so you can build  a fan relationship without the dread of impending retirement)   * Luka Doncic - Dallas Mavericks - Young guard who is lighting up the NBA. Very likeable personality and fun to watch. Not as flashy as others but still very entertaining to watch. [Luka Highlights](https://youtu.be/aJBl7RMDlVo) * Trae Young - Atlanta Hawks - Another young guard that is coming into his own. Trash talker, can be flashy on the court, absolutely awesome to watch him play and interact with the fans. [Trae Young Highlights](https://youtu.be/l4Cwaj351aM)[Trae Young v New York Knicks Fans](https://youtu.be/gXPhb1HthNk) * Zion Williamson - New Orleans Pelicans - Freak. He is just an athletic Freak my guy. If he can stay healthy, he is a dominant force and plays the game physically. [Zion Highlights](https://youtu.be/j3RPnA4pvKw) * Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers - Center. Big and strong dude that plays a whole lot of Defense. Sort of troll sometimes, especially if someone calls him out. ex: Andre Drummond [Joel Highlights](https://youtu.be/hxuiQrvKETs)  The NBA is stacked with talent and the youth of the league is fantastic. If you are wanting a current great that I didnt list, you cannot go wrong with Giannis, Lebron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, or a multitude of others.   If you want to go the opposite route and choose a team first, I would recommend choosing the closest franchise to yourself. It is a whole other experience being able to attend the home games from time to time. If that's not your jam, then I would choose one of the ""younger"" teams so you can watch them grow and compete. Ex: Memphis Grizzlies, Oklahoma City Thunder, New Orleans Pelicans.   If you do not want to cement your choice on team or player, watch the games, highlights, play the video games, get involved somehow to give yourself an interest. I would highly recommend checking out the highlights of some of the greats from the past generations and comparing them to todays game.   Whatever you decide to do, don't take the toxicity you receive from others too seriously. There is no problem with throwing your interest into a popular player or cheering for the Lakers, if that is what you like. Basketball is game and being a fan is about enjoying the product. Remember that."
1. Kevin Durant  2. (Would be Kawhi Leonard but he injured) Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Luka Doncic  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Joel Embiid  8. LeBron James  9. Jayson Tatum  10. Anthony Davis
"Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons is from the pre 3pt line era, has no idea what it is."
"He’s not any of those things anymore. That’s like saying D-Rose is the superstar of the Knicks lmao. Joel Embiid can lead you guys to a title but you need a great second option, Tobias is a 3rd option and Ben can’t be a second. You need to find somebody else."
Joel Embiid does a lot of good things for his community
Joel Embiid is really good at flopping
"Morey came in and shipped Horford and Richardson as soon as he could, and we're already looking to move Ben less than a year after he got here. He seems pretty unattached to everyone on the roster not named Joel Embiid so...  And I'd hope he stays greedy if what he's ""missing out"" on is Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley or a Malcom Brogdon deal lol"
"Fox is the franchise, so in terms of relative meaningfulness to our respective teams, it’d be like us demanding “the inclusion of Joel Embiid” in a trade lmfao"
Embiid has shown no discontent at all at this point in time. He understands the best value the team would get is to not trade him for peanuts. Joel would rather have a better team and play with Ben for a few months this year than wallow in mediocrity with role players. This isn’t a Dame situation where the team can only get worse.
"Hawks were the only team to beat Milwaukee in Milwaukee. They were the 1 in 10-1.  The entire series flipped because Trae got hurt. But if the Hawks don't play the Bucks it is unlikely the same set of circumstances unfold where Trae steps on a refs foot, it's such a random event that it probably only happened in this one scenario versus Bucks for whatever reason it happened.  But a healthy Hawks beat an injured Nets. And they would beat a healthy Suns.    The same way they obliterated the knicks and defeated the Top Seeded 76ers who had an MVP level guy in Joel Embiid and Seth Curry shooting 55 percent from three on high volume. Plus 76ers D was lockdown they were better than Suns.   Also I am not a Hawks fan I am a Lakers fan but just calling things fairly from what I saw"
"That’s true. I think he can train doing cuts and curls and get back to the old Klay, if not pretty close. Because he’s following a predetermined path. Whereas defense involves so much reactive movement. As for not being able to rely on open 3’s, I think attacking closeouts can also be matter of timing. Joel Embiid has a glacial pump fake but it still works for getting into the paint. Kyle Anderson can get a defender closing out on him into the air and successfully drive to the basket. Klay will need to adapt."
"Joel Embiid from time to time behaves like this too. He used to do the Rocky run around Philly at 3AM, no security/entourage. I'm sure you've seen the random game at the park he joined in on as well.  &amp;nbsp;  Strangely enough, even though KD's grown up in America and has been famous since HS/college, at times he seems to not act like a megastar as well. The whole social media thing is one thing, but I also remember him doing stuff like asking random OKC residents on Twitter if anyone's running a flag football game and actually showing up"
"Joel embiid, ben simmons and jimmy butler"
"&gt;	Impact metrics do paint him in a positive light.   Slight positive to neutral. Really all world defense coming from someone who has never protected the paint or interior, right?   &gt;	And during the playoffs, the impact metrics painted him typically on the same level, if not just better, than Curry during their tenure together.  Curry led the post season in 2015, 2017, and 2019 augmented plus minus, where was Durant? Oh right, his efficiency plummets 8 percentage points once Curry left the floor and averaged a **turnover per assist**  He doesn’t protect the rim, he turns the ball over more than joel embiid when asked to create and his efficiency craters when an all time guard isn’t doing the offensive lifting for him"
Joel Embiid was top 3 what? If you saying top 3 in mvp voting then he was rightfully so
He's in Tier 2A along with Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.
"That's what makes Hinkie such an enigma. He had some amazing draft picks and undrafted free agent signings, but also let a lot of them go so I don't know how much credit to give him.   If you run The Process over again 100 times, I wonder in how many scenarios they would be NBA champions by this point. So many things have gone wrong and yet just getting Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has them competing."
"&gt;	That's right - Durant is not on the same level - he's the much better player than Curry.   Is that why he lost to Curry head to head and joined his team right after Curry beat him with a fucked knee?  &gt;	Alpha KD physically made beta Steph his bitch and took over the reigns at GSW,   What a weird way to describe Durant not even seeing **third** in time with the ball, dribbles per possession, passes completed behind Curry and Draymond. Why didn’t Kerr trust Durant to initiate the offense deep into the post season? Oh because Durant turns the ball over as much as joel embiid when asked to create. Some “””””alpha””””.   Funnily enough for you, the alpha player you think Durant is pulled the weakest move in all of sports history by joining the team that kicked his ass a few months prior. He joined a 73 win team lmao"
He isn’t available in both regular season and post season. Maybe if he was able to play more during the season instead of 2nd they get first in the East. Those regular season games where he isn’t available also count as important moments missed. Not just playoffs.   50/40/90 would be more impressive if he did it over the course of an actual full season. However he didn’t because he was injured and the shortened season. So numbers get skewed into his favor due to just having a lower sample size. One mediocre game takes him out of that group of people. Joel Embiid was essentially on pace to do something similar while averaging a double double and the difference between him getting MVP and not was simply because of the fact he was injured. So injuries come into affect when evaluating other players don’t know why Kyrie gets to dodge the bullet here too.    Westbrook took a dumpster fire and transformed and elevated the team to a higher level. They had no right making playoffs and it was strictly because of Westbrook. The Nets were winning without Kyrie. They had KD and Harden who are far more important to the team than him.   All I’m saying is that Kyrie shouldn’t get an extension YET. Let him play an actual entire season (70+ games)and see how he does then pay him after. I just don’t think he is worth it simply because he is so injury prone not even due to skill.
"Yeah I think Ben Simmons is a great defender but he doesn't deserve to be in DPOY talks at all. I think Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, and Joel Embiid are all noticeably more impactful defenders than him."
&gt;having the build of a less fat Joel Embiid  So... not like Embiid at all then?
"Joel Embiid was a +9.3 per 100 possessions in the Sixers Hawks series, and a +16 per 100 through both rounds. How spacing was around Joel was not a problem- the Sixers already did extremely well when he was on the floor!"
"He doesn't have all the tools. His court awareness is non-existent, he has stone hands, his lateral quickness isn't great, he isn't particularly skilled and on top of that he wants to play like Kevin Durant while having the build of a less fat Joel Embiid."
"Imagine telling Embiid that you’re trading the guy who can guard the other teams best player and who lives to pass Joel the ball, for a guy who is a bottom 5 defender in the NBA and will take his shots away."
"The horror risk, for Philly, is that the star that wants out is the actual superstar they have - Embiid.  Unlike Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid is not on a long term contract."
Very very good. Joel Embiid caliber basically (maybe a small step down realistically). If China didn't run him into the ground and gave him his off-seasons to rest he could have had at least 4 or 5 more years of dominance.
If Joel is completely healthy going into this year's playoffs how is sixers ceiling not as high?  It looked pretty good until the injury caught up with  him: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nobody-told-joel-embiid-that-centers-dont-dominate-the-nba-anymore/
"Sixers fans are like “take literally everyone not named Joel Embiid and every pick we can legally trade. pick swaps. also you can beat me up as a sweetener”  and Knicks fans are like “LOOK if it comes down to it, I GUESS we can give up Frank”"
"Ben to Dame is as to CJ is to Embiid  Does anyone think CJ, plus our two young players and picks is gonna work for Joel? No? Ya this is the same.   Not offended but you this is also sort of a joke thread here. No one is getting Embiid right now"

"Dude if the Sixers can't even outbid the Knicks, they're going to seriously risk a Joel Embiid trade demand somewhere else within the next year.    And for what it's worth, it seems that the Knicks maybe need just one guy like Dame in place for the next unhappy star player to look their way."
as opposed to perennially healthy ironman Joel Embiid 🙄
"The creators of that list did a [""4-years-later"" podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-25-best-players-in-the-nba-in-2025/id1513185617?i=1000501914533) in December 2020 where they discuss the old list and make a new one for 2025.  Spoiler warning: the 2025 list is in the description of the pod. It's also posted below:  &gt;! Here's our list for posterity's sake, along with their ages as of Jan. 1, 2025.!&lt;  1. &gt;!Luka Doncic (25)!&lt; 2. &gt;!Trae Young (26)!&lt; 3. &gt;!Giannis Antetokounmpo (30)!&lt; 4. &gt;!Anthony Davis (31)!&lt; 5. &gt;!Zion Williamson (24)!&lt; 6. &gt;!Jayson Tatum (26)!&lt; 7. &gt;!Jamal Murray (27)!&lt; 8. &gt;!Nikola Jokic (29)!&lt; 9. &gt;!LeBron James (40)!&lt; 10. &gt;!Kawhi Leonard (33)!&lt; 11. &gt;!Cade Cunningham (23)!&lt; 12. &gt;!James Wiseman (23)!&lt; 13. &gt;!Karl-Anthony Towns (29)!&lt; 14. &gt;!Devin Booker (28)!&lt; 15. &gt;!Kevin Durant (36)!&lt; 16. &gt;!Joel Embiid (30)!&lt; 17. &gt;!Ben Simmons (28)!&lt; 18. &gt;!Stephen Curry (36)!&lt; 19. &gt;!Bam Adebayo (27)!&lt; 20. &gt;!Jimmy Butler (35)!&lt; 21. &gt;!Michael Porter Jr. (26)!&lt; 22. &gt;!Donovan Mitchell (28)!&lt; 23. &gt;!Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (26)!&lt; 24. &gt;!Damian Lillard (34)!&lt; 25. &gt;!Jaren Jackson Jr. (25) !&lt;"
"Wilt and Russell were both absolute athletic freaks that would dominate in any era.  Russell was a bigger, stronger, faster, and more explosive Draymond Green. You could drop him on any team in any year and he would be the best defender in the league by wide margin.  Wilt was a taller/faster/more agile Joel Embiid without the injury problems. There is no year in the history of the league where Wilt would not have been a top five player.   Look the wilt chamberlain archive on YouTube, he has a ton of great footage of guys from that era."
Turkish Joel Embiid.
Jared Dudley was only ever valuable bc he tries to get guys ejected. Look at the Embiid one. Joel just walks away bc he knows he’s a clown.
"It's interesting how quickly Dennis Schröder tanked his value, on paper he should easily be able to get a contract worth 15-20mil. Even Lakers fans were expecting him to get offered something bigger than the initial 84/4. Now he's got 1 offer for a MLE.   People are going to overblow his 0 pt game out of proportion, I mean Joel Embiid was held to a 0 pt game 2 years ago and he's in MVP discussion. It feels like his tanking value is almost entirely from his poor attitude.   Whatever it is I'm glad he's getting shafted. Sad reality is the dude borderline crippled someone in Atlanta and got barely any flack from it, but demanding a big salary was enough to trigger Lakers fans"
I get that but it’s easy to get bunnies to Joel Embiid. Anthony Edwards figured out last year that passing to KAT = spacing for him and assists.
Westbrook was far and away the least efficient player to score 20+ PPG last year:  |Rk|Player|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|22.2|.509| |2|Pascal Siakam|21.4|.547| |3|Jerami Grant|22.3|.556| |4|Nikola Vucevic|23.4|.560| |5|Malcolm Brogdon|21.2|.561| |6|DeAaron Fox|25.2|.565| |7|Julius Randle|24.1|.567| |8|Donovan Mitchell|26.4|.569| |9|Collin Sexton|24.3|.573| |10|Terry Rozier|20.4|.575| |11|Jayson Tatum|26.4|.576| |12|Brandon Ingram|23.8|.584| |13|Jaylen Brown|24.7|.586| |14|Devin Booker|25.6|.587| |15|Luka Doncic|27.7|.587| |16|Khris Middleton|20.4|.588| |17|Trae Young|25.3|.589| |18|DeMar DeRozan|21.6|.591| |19|Bradley Beal|31.3|.593| |20|Paul George|23.3|.598| |21|Domantas Sabonis|20.3|.601| |22|Jimmy Butler|21.5|.607| |23|Kyrie Irving|26.9|.614| |24|Kawhi Leonard|24.8|.622| |25|Damian Lillard|28.8|.623| |26|Giannis Antetokounmpo|28.1|.633| |27|Zach LaVine|27.4|.634| |28|Joel Embiid|28.5|.636| |29|Nikola Jokic|26.4|.647| |30|Zion Williamson|27.0|.649| |31|Stephen Curry|32.0|.655|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/psl_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021.
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
" I've literally not heard one person say they think Kyrie is done and the Nets shouldnt extend him. Not one. I assume other players with multiple surgeries on a body part are also washed right? Michael Porter, Jr, Joel Embiid??  The fact that every single one of your comments is getting downvoted may suggested that this is not the default position you think it is..."
"It's a toss up honestly and I can see why you would pick Duncan and KG. For the sake of it, I'll give an argument for Giannis.  First off, [the league today has a massive drop off in the amount of post play in todays league compared to Duncan/KG's era](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/12/2/20991249/post-up-dead-nba-brooklyn-nets-joel-embiid). In the 2000 playoffs (23 games), [Shaq alone attempted 400+ post up plays](https://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1291923). Just to put this into perspective, Embiid has the most post up plays per game this last year in the league and in 51 games, he's only attempted about 311 post up plays. We know how the league was in the late 90's and early 2000's, there were many more centers around the league posting up.  So, with that said, this naturally will give players like Giannis less opportunities to block people who are trying to back them down. Giannis is much more mobile than Timmy and is better at stealing the ball than Timmy. Giannis can be compared to KG a little bit easier because both have lateral quickness that allowed them to steal the ball, protect the wing and move in to protect the rim but I'm still going to give it up to Giannis due to the lesser amount of post plays in todays generation.  I would project players like Giannis, Embiid, and Gobert to have 25-50% more blocks a game if there were as many posts ups now as there were back in 2000. Giannis would have more BPG over KG but still a considerable amount below Duncan since Timmy actually played the C more often in his career than KG and Giannis. Even tho KG plays C more than Giannis, I believe Giannis is more athletic which would make him more capable of blocking players that would post him up.  So, if you want to believe the data presented, I believe it's a toss-up. If not, than I wouldn't blame you for picking KG and Duncan over Giannis defensively, but I'll just say that neither KG or Duncan were as much of a threat nor were they as consistent as Giannis on the offensive end, who currently does more than they do offensively on less minutes per game than them."
"Embiid is as close to olajuwon as the NBA has right now, but he has a long way to go before this is a fair comparison. Joel is a better shooter from distance and a slightly better free throw shooter, but in every other metric, Hakeem dominates."
"""The Athletic: Insiders say that, for the Trailblazers, it's less about improving the roster and more about trading for Joel Embiid."""
"Started with 15, had a scolarship for Montverde with 16. Unreal. Is Joel Embiid the biggest basketball talent ever?"
"I think it's a testament to Hakeem's ability when the only big who has come close to replicating it is Joel Embiid, and to a much lesser extent."
This is only partially true. They still allowed teams to self-report heights and there was no independent verification. It’s why Joel Embiid was officially listed at 6’11.5” by the Sixers but was still consistently taller than other guys listed at 7’.
"Every single guy you listed has a reason for developing one later, most of them grew up or played in a League where big guys weren't supposed to take 3s and then it became popular to do.  Joel Embiid however started playing basketball later into his life than most NBA players so it makes sense that the 3 point was developed later for him.  For reference Joel Embiid started playing ball at 15, Sengun was mvp of the Turkish bball league at 18.  While I say all of this I'm not saying he still couldn't develop a 3.  Just that we shouldn't automatically assume every single player can develop one just because some old school big developed them when it became normal"
If you think Joel Embiid is anything less than a generational talent you’re a bigger clown than I thought
Andre Drummond Vs Joel Embiid
"And you know what's funny? Haven't we seen a ton of good offensive bigs just suddenly extend their range to the 3 point line halfway through their career? Marc Gasol, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Al Horford, all these dudes started out shooting only last-second heaves but were solid in the midrange, then they stepped back one summer and naturally added a 35% J to their arsenal.  I'm certainly not saying Sengun is going to start making 3+ a game, but it seems like one of those things I'd be less worried about if I were a GM."
"Seth Curry(45% 3pt), Danny Green(40% 3pt), Tobias Harris(39% 3pt), Joel Embiid(38% 3pt).  When Green got hurt in the playoffs they replaced him with Korkmaz(37.5% 3pt)  The 76ers had pretty much as perfect of a roster construction as you could ever hope to put around Simmons in the NBA without moving him to Center."
"if it were embiid he'd make it his nickname  Joel ""Socialite"" Embiid  gotta own it"
So they want to trade Joel Embiid and pair Dame D.O.L.L.A. with the Socialite?
"CJ, Nurk, and a first for Embiid. See you soon in Portland Joel!"
"&gt;Holding Simmons is precisely how you piss off Embiid  Morey was hanging out with him [less than a week ago](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/08/joel-embiid-and-daryl-morey-are-a-formidable-tennis-pairing.html), plus Embiid has been spending a lot of time in the team facilities this offseason. I'd assume Embiid is on board with whatever the plan is."
"He [clearly](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/08/joel-embiid-and-daryl-morey-are-a-formidable-tennis-pairing.html) gets along with Morey pretty well, I'm they've talked about the situation. Getting Ben off the team doesn't necessarily help, getting a star player helps, that's my view on it."
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
I would say Embiid is better than Gobert because he Joel can do 90% what he does at the rim but can defend away from the basket much better than Gobert
Damn so Joel Embiid is going to demand a trade
"that was also weird, but you steered it into a completely different conversation, why not talk about joel embiid at that point"

"Lol, ya'll are worse the TWolves fans. The Nuggets gave up fewer points per game in the restricted area and paint in general in both the playoffs and the regular season than the Sixers did this year.   On the other side of the court, one is a career below league average live-ball (rEFG %) scorer in both regular season + playoffs (even worse as a Center) and a turnover machine who often falls apart late in games and the other is one of the most efficient scorers in all of basketball and one of, if not, the best playmaker currently in the league.  This past season, Jokic made more 2pt FG per game on better efficiency, more 3pt FG per game on better efficiency, is a better FT shooter, averaged fewer turnovers, more offensive rebounds, and completely blew Embiid out of the water in terms of assists. One is among the best offensive players in all of basketball, and the other is thoroughly overrated.  Not to mention, Jokic has only missed 20 career games and Joel Embiid's best season ever in term of health he missed 18.  He has missed more games than he has played for his career. There's a reason Joel Embiid has been behind Jokic in All-NBA, GM Surveys, and MVP voting for 3 consecutive years - and it sure as shit isn't media preference."
"This is actually the stupidest conversation I’ve had today.    Ben Simmons has played as the 2nd option to an All-World talent in Joel Embiid, and has done jack shit in the playoffs despite having contending teams built around him.    Lebron was putting up 28/8/8 with absolute ass teams around him, and he was dragging those teams kicking and screaming to the Finals.    &gt;	2x all defensive first team in 4 seasons? yeah such a scrub trade him for scraps  All defensive means exactly jack shit in the playoffs.  Especially when he can’t even stay on the floor in big moments.    And they can’t trade him for scraps.  They tried and failed."
James Harden   Reggie Miller   LeBron James   Dennis Rodman   Joel Embiid
"Difference AD lost to an all time great team in the Warriors, whereas Joel and his number 1 seeded team lost to a Hawks team people were questioning they would even make the playoffs at the beginning of the season.  If you switch AD and Embiid, Lakers would have lost in the bubble or had a harder route. They needed his unparalleled switch 1-5 ability. Guys like Dame, Jamal, Harden would feast in drop coverages."
Idk man  Best young center-Joel Embiid  Best young power forward- AD Best young small forward- tatum/Ingram  Best young shooting guard-Devin Booker Best young PG- trae young  Of course luka is better then trae and there's an argument between Joel and Jokic. Giannis is pretty close with AD.
"Rudy ""Joel Embiid"" Gobert"
It's a good thing Joel Embiid isn't French.
"No shit everybody would prefer Dame over CJ, the fact remains that unless you’re willing to trade Joel, you don’t have the assets to get Dame.   Morey plays hardball with Simmons, why the fuck not play hardball right back?  See what I’m saying? Your game theory works when you’re biased and want Philly to win, but loses standing when reality hits.   Nothing you have sans Embiid is worth Dame, nothing."
"WCF, Warriors v Lakers. He holds Lebron to 40 points and GSW Warriors go on to lose to a 76ers team led by Dame Lillard and Joel Embiid"

Counting on Joel “made of glass” Embiid to get hurt?
"&gt; while greeting the new free agents  yeah, with a look of contempt on his face lol                &gt;  front office sat there 2 summers ago and decided to build around Ben Simmons instead of Joel Embiid/Jimmy               damn, you people make stuff up more than the media heads you always give crap to for making stuff up. How the hell is signing Al Horford to be Joel's backup because of his long injury history 'building around Simmons and not Joel'? They also signed Al because he was thought to be somewhat of a nemesis for Joel. Also, signing Tobias to a massively oversized contract rather than sign Jimmy had nothing to do with Simmons. Ben deserves a lot of criticism, absolutely, but people left right and centre are just making stuff up because they know it will get them karma"
thank you for clarifying.  I was genuinely concerned that Joel Embiid and Andre Drummond would be laying out bricks at their local construction site.
"Joel ""WebMD"" Embiid"
"I already wrote a long spiel about this else where so I’ll just paste it here. I think Philly is a bad fit for him because even though embiid can hit 3’s, that isn’t his primary game. And that’s not even the biggest reason, the biggest reason for me is that there is nothing he can contribute off ball due to the type of player Joel is. If he played with a dynamic perimeter threat who’s bread and butter is as a pnr handler Simmons would immediately become 1000x more useful on offense. Because he could contribute by setting good screen, rolling, and either finishing or playmaking off the short roll a la draymond. Embiid doesn’t want a screen he wants space to work in the post.   Anyway here’s the spiel:  &gt; No the bad fit was the sixers creating a roster where Ben is supposed to be the point guard. You can understand why they tried it early on in his career but it’s now proven not to work. The problem with the sixers is that even though tobias and Joel can shoot, they still do a fuck ton of their work inside the arc. And bens presence is a negative when he’s not involved in the action because he’s killing the spacing. Both tobias and Joel are most comfortable in the mid and high post. They both want to take their man 1 on 1 and don’t need a screen they just need you out the way. So he can’t do anything to contribute to the team when off the ball with the sixers roster basically.   &gt;Where as if you deploy him with an elite perimeter threat in a draymond green role he can provide immense value without the ball in his hands by screening and cutting.   &gt;Also another reason Philly is a bad fit for him is because Joel such a dominant defender. His defense would be so much more valuable to a team that actually needs it. Like hypothetically if a cj + stuff for Ben trade happened. He would be transformative for their defense whereas in Philly he’s just the cherry on top."
What kind of sick person ignores phones called from Joel Embiid?
"getting run over by joel fucking embiid and living to tell the tale, you’re a legend"
"Just as much, if not more, than Ben Simmons had he been on a team without Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris. Plus, hE mAdE aN AlLsTaR TeAm really falls flat when you look at all-star representation based on market size."
"Exactly this. I don’t understand this threw his teammate under the bus shit for Joel. He was asked what he thought the turning point was, and he listed a specific sequence of events - the missed open shot, Trae sinking a three, and then Embiid turning the ball over. And he’s exactly right. Any one of those events on their own wouldn’t have been terrible, but put together it absolutely sucked all the hope out of the stadium.  If he singled out Ben then I would agree, but that’s not what happened. Doc on the other hand...sheesh."
"Joel playing tennis with Morey in Philly. Working out in Philly. Ben chilling out. Doing his own thing with his people somewhere else.   Like dude, after what happened in the playoffs, and skipping out playing for Australia for the nth time saying he's gonna be working on his game, he should be going lowkey. Ben has never gone through any of the Sixers offseason/ development plan for him. He's always chosen to do his own thing.   It's no wonder Philly hate Ben now and love Embiid."
"Okay, all that may be true, but the only person that was a true teammate to Ben when he really needed the guys around him to build him back up was Dwight. So again, if you're gonna sever the tie, fine, trade him and get on with it. But this whole reaching out to see what's going on, wtf is that? Joel Embiid knows what's going on because he was part of it, along with Glenn, and the front office who all either piled on, or stood by. It is what it is. I'm not saying Ben should stay in Philly, or he didn't deserve some of the criticism levied at him, I'm just saying the relationship is where it is and Philly sort of intimated they were looking to trade him, so okay. Keep that same energy from a month ago and get on with it because it's clear to me there's no way you can go back to the time before at this point."
Lol embiid said he thought him passing up an easy 2 was the turning point of the game. Of Ben thinks he's wrong then he can shove it. Dude played on a torn meniscus to have his healthy best player turn into a coward again. Joel can say whatever he wants
"Joel Embiid and Andre Drummond are like Shaq and Zo, but Joel is both Shaq and Zo"
Joel Embiid is also staying with the Sixers. Why would you expect Ben to show up for an organization that is clearly trying to get rid of him?
"we didn’t really lol, it literally has prevented us from being a championship team  let Butler leave, signed 2 massive albatross contracts in his place, a massive massive swing. still a good team and fringe contender purely by the grace of god (Joel Embiid)"
It’s crazy how people think Lillard is some superstar that will push you over the edge. I’d rather ride it out with Embiid and Simmons by actually getting them some help. The problem isn’t Ben or Joel it’s the fact that the rest roster is trash
"Ridiculous. Embiid literally changed his game and developed 3 point range to improve his fit with Simmons and this dude won’t even take layups in the very paint that he can’t be away from due to his negative range. Joel has defended him at every turn, it should be zero issue that he expressed some frustration with a series defining play."
"This is why Ben Simmons is a loser.  Joel Embiid is at the Sixers working out, getting in shape, and improving his game, while greeting the new free agents and rookies.  Jimmy Butler, who Simmons and his daddy Brett Brown ran out of town, has spent the summer recruiting to build up his organization.   It is insane that Brett Brown and the Colangelo influenced front office sat there 2 summers ago and decided to build around Ben Simmons instead of Joel Embiid/Jimmy."
"Embiid has been trolling Drummond and calling him soft for years. They had a little ""feud"" where Embiid basically owned his ass.  [This article covers it pretty well](https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/nba-free-agency-sixers-andre-drummond-signing-digs-his-joel-embiid-beef)"
"Exactly, Slovenia has the assets to make a trade.    Could they get Joel Embiid for a couple of thousand of kids? If Australia decides to rebuild Ben Simmons may also be on the market for the rights to your 2025 babys and the right to swap 2026 babies."
Bold of you to assume Joel Embiid won't just chuck him to the furthest team he can throw Ben at.
"&gt;joel embiid scored more points per game with better fg% and 3p%  You're leaving out loads of context here: Embiid's game is predicates upon drawing fouls around the rim. Of course his FG% will be higher when he's constantly getting FTs at the line. Furthermore that difference is 2% on a season that AD was in the dumps in terms of shooting. Secondly, AD was constantly sitting out or playing injured for most of the season on top of having a bad start.  &gt;potential means nothing they're all in their primes at this point lol  As you said both are in their primes. Davis, as we've seen in the Bubble, displayed a scoring ability that supercedes anything Embiid or Jokic has shown yet. As such I'm counting that towards his potential till it's proven a fluke, which this season will show us that.  &gt;versatility... jokic is an elite playmaker who can shoot from anywhere and finish  Jokic is great, but most of his value comes from his cerebral ability--  like CP3. Also as we've seen last season he's easier to defend than both Embiid and AD.  &gt;embiid is an elite defender and scorer, i just dont agree with you man  So is AD. And it's fine if we disagree, I'll just say KD called AD a cheat code for a reason."
"joel embiid scored more points per game with better fg% and 3p% and is at least an equal caliber defender to davis and shoots more mid ranges than davis and is a better finisher than davis so im not sure how davis is a better three level scorer  potential means nothing they're all in their primes at this point lol   versatility... jokic is an elite playmaker who can shoot from anywhere and finish, embiid is an elite defender and scorer, i just dont agree with you man"
"""That’s it!!! I’ve seen enough. Build around Tony Bradley @sixers""  -Joel Embiid  https://twitter.com/joelembiid/status/1370199867662929920?lang=en"
smh except it's not actually a nebulous concept for anyone who has looked at synergy data.    holy shit no one seriously guards devin booker or joel embiid beyond the 3 point line.  Devin booker wasn't even top 50 in true shooting last year.    I'm done with this.  Mia runs Robinson off screens all game and the defense has to account for him constantly- it creates countless opportunities for other teammates.  those other guards you listed are also elite shooters and defenders never leave them alone... and they make a TON more money than Robinson does.
"""Joel Embiid is out indefinitely with a broken orbital bone after being elbowed by teammate Andre Drummond in practice, league sources tell ESPN""  \-- Woj, two months or so in the future"
"Here's my problem with the pack the paint takes:  - you have to have a guard that can stop Russ from getting in the paint and  - you have to have a center that will protect the rim when he gets there.  The Sixers had that last year for sure in Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid.  I maintain that, especially if you put a small ball lineup on the floor, Russ is a matchup nightmare for most guards. Steph, Dame, Donovan...they can't guard Russ.   Then the centers in the West are either soft or just not big enough to deter Russ. Gobert and Jokic maybe, but again, if you're guarding AD at the 5 you just gonna let him have an open shot? Russ can get him the ball.  This is why he was so efficient with the Rockets - his rim finishing that year as fantastic.  So...idk. Surround Russ with shooters (and defense) seems to be the way to do it."
I guess we’ll have to settle for Joel embiid then
"Hopefully Joel Embiid can anchor the defense like Caruso, Vuc, and Lonzo."
I think France were trying to convince Joel Embiid to switch allegiance from Cameroon to France at one stage? Gobert and Embiid rotation at centre would have been insane 🤣
That would depend on how quickly he pisses off Joel Embiid
"I mean he's big body whose only skill is rebounding the ball, he does fuck all else at a high level  He'll be lucky to still be in the league by next summer if this is the attitude he's bringing to Philly lmao. What he gon do, fight Joel Embiid? Sixer fans will chase Drummond out of Philadelphia with pitchforks"
Marc Gasol/Joel Embiid
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
"Ben Simmons is a very good, but also very flawed player. He is nowhere near the biggest reason The Process has reached its current state. Three broad and interlinked reasons which have been more detrimental to the process:  * Colangelos / Silver - Basically, the league intervention into the 76ers management. It's not that Colangelo is a bum (though I don't care for his team-building strategy), but their methods did not make for a good transition from the Hinkie era.     * Also, that's a totally normal-sized collar * 76ers management and lack of accountability - Simmons's lack of development is more than just Simmons's fault. The 76ers management created an environment where abject sucking was okay and that led to a lack of accountability with the players themselves.     * TBH, it's amazing that Embiid has been able to make the improvements to his game. In a better developmental environment, he might have reached his current 1-2 seasons earlier, but that's also been very hard to project given his injuries.  * Nearly all other Process-era picks not named Joel Embiid - Guys like Okafor, Fultz, TLC, not keeping Bridges. Could Simmons be better? Of course. But what if any of those other guys was better?"
"I wouldn’t consider them a wash - they are about the same in PPG except Tobias is taller, better at rebounding, and isn’t coming off of a fractured foot. But for argument’s sake, let’s say they’re a wash.  Aside from those two, the Sixers are bigger and more defensively-sound, including MVP-candidate Joel Embiid. The Blazers are undersized and terrible defensively.   I know it sucks to think you might lose your franchise player, and I’m not saying Philly is a championship contender with our current roster, but you’re delusional if you think Philly with Dame wouldn’t more of a contender than the current Blazers roster with Dame."
"If Dame joined Philly he would already have 2 players on the roster that are better than any player he’s ever played with, including MVP candidate Joel Embiid. How would that team be just as much of a contender as Portland?"
"If they need defense, might as well get Joel Embiid or Giannis too."
"they were getting at each other all night, and Embiid sold that he got hit in the face  big flop; early Joel was always doing this shit.   Got Mitchell on one right around that same time"
Joel “The Nightmare” Embiid  It caught traction for a little bit when he wore his black mask in the playoffs few years ago but didn’t catch on. The Process is obviously iconic af but The Nightmare should be his secondary one considering the attachment to Hakeem “The Dream.”
"“Joel embiid is unhappy with the sixers, the blazers have become a team with significant interest in a trade to bring him to Portland”"
"I don't know.  But I hope Rich Paul is smart enough to maximize the marketing potential of 3 of his properties (Lavine, Simmons, Maxey) by having them join forces with Joel Embiid.    Jrue Holiday was in the same position, and his agent got him to Milwaukee to play with Giannis.  Worst outcome for Klutch Sports is Ben Simmons traded to small market Minnesota,  Lavine stays in 6th-9th seed Chicago, with Maxey trying to carry hollowed out Philly.  May seem far fetched, but give me the scenario where Klutch Sports makes out better?"
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
Okay but the sixers aren't in the playoffs because of ben simmons they're in the playoffs because of their mvp caliber player joel embiid.
Hinkie said he would have taken Brandon Ingram over ben Simmons so there is that... I liked Ingram more then and I think obviously would have been a better fit with joel embiid.  Simmons just doesnt put effort in getting better on the offensive front.
He’s also played alongside a damn good big named Joel Embiid.
"&gt;I think by handling the exit from the playoffs poorly  How exactly did he handle it poorly? He wasn't the one shit talking teammates or blaming other people in the media.  &gt;Any other star player would have said ""this is on me""  Well, except for Joel Embiid apparently, whose first reaction was to blame Simmons and didn't take any responsibility until Simmons requested a trade this week."
"Dude, he wasn’t even singled out. I can’t believe how divorced from reality these takes are. Are y’all hallucinating or did you just not watch the interviews?  First off, Embiid (when asked when he thought they wouldn’t win the game anymore) said it was when “we missed an open shot and then made 1 free throw” and described how that and the next few plays together felt like the turning point of the game. Then he said that HE, Embiid, turned the ball over during that sequence and that was on him. Not only did he not single Simmons out, he made a very clear effort to take responsibility and call it a team loss.  Doc was directly asked about Ben’s offense and he said he “still believes in him” and that they have a lot of work to do over the summer. Then Doc was directly asked whether Ben could be a point guard on a championship team “like the one the Sixers want to become,” and Doc said “I don’t know.”  (Side note, what a cowardly question. You can tell the reporter knew how shitty it was by the way he worded it.)  Embiid and Doc bent over backwards to avoid singling out Ben or blaming him for the loss. Everyone in the world saw that Ben underperformed so obviously that’s what everyone (Doc/Joel included) is thinking about when they hear Embiid/Doc talk about the game, but the narrative that they threw him under the bus is 100% on the media and the fans and has zero basis in reality."
"I think coaching might play a factor (I don't see Doc Rivers as a great Xs-Os coach who always makes the best end of game adjustments), but my theory on the main reason for subpar 4th quarter performance is a lack of energy from Joel Embiid.   Here's the problem with him playing with Ben Simmons: Joel Embiid has to work much harder than most superstars on offense all game long because his Point Guard has a shooting range shorter than my dick. Joel Embiid has to run around the perimeter too much trying to create offense much more than he should be when he should be planted inside most of the game either comically bullying smaller guys all game long ala Shaq, or getting double-teamed and swinging it to the open shooter.  In the regular season, it usually doesn't matter because teams don't prepare as hard and there's more of a transition element where Ben Simmons still thrives. But when games slow down in the half court in the competitive playoffs, Joel Embiid is far more tired than the other teams at the end of games, so overall team efficiency plummets and he's going to brick shots he normally makes and be slower.  I don't know if Ben Simmons is good enough to warrant a team constructed around him, but I think in an optimal world he kind of plays a point-center type of role: surround him basically with 4 shooters and have a fast paced running team."
What? We didnt want Ben Simmons Tobias Harris or Joel Embiid.  What other 3 starters we talking about here
"Even before seeing this, knowing a fraction of what Giannis has gone through strictly leading into his NBA career, Giannis is the ultimate overachiever. As a Sixers fan I realize we may never get past Giannis, but I can’t act like he’s not my favorite player not names Joel Hans “do a 180” Embiid.  No one hates Giannis. It’s not even remotely possible to dislike Giannis."
That’s not gonna happen. It kills any shot the Sixers have at winning with Embiid. Joel might as well just demand a trade at that point if they’re gonna let a max player slot stay home.
"To clarify, I think a CJ Green Ben RoCo Joel line up with Seth as a sixth man and a Maxy, Thybull, Furk, Georges, Drummond bench would be championship worthy.  I'm a former long blazer fan. I appreciate the fuck out of cj. He is smart, a great locker room presence, a fanastic shot creator, and a three point shooter who has never relied on pnr. That is a great combo for Embiid. Joel, CJ, and Tobi would be a great team, but the east is just too good right now to even have a chance."
"I always say ""Eff Joel Embiid"" and then put money in my swear jar but honestly he's such an awesome dude. I also really like Ric Flair."
The sixers do not want picks they want someone to help Joel embiid and the team win a championship
"Simmons will be gone before the deadline, I don't think there's a scenario in which we actually run it back in the playoffs. But his value is already at the lowest it can go, and that includes sitting out games or making public comments etc. Everyone's last memory of him is game 7 against the Hawks and shooting 33% from the FT line that series. Sitting out, not showing up to camp, that's all noise. Your value is determined by how you play on the court, and it's why the Rockets got the exact same offers for Harden once he quit on the court, that they could've gotten 2 months earlier. Nobody actually wants to trade for Ben, so honestly I still don't see what big package we're giving up. Buddy Heild and Marvin Bagley will be available to us at all times if that's the best we can do.  You're getting a little too far ahead of yourself with the last part lol. Joel Embiid just finished 2nd in MVP voting and is locked in for 5 more seasons at least. The NBA moves fast, I thought after we lost to Boston in the bubble it was all over and actually you can hire a good FO, change coach, trade out players who don't work, and get better as a team."
"If you think about it, maybe Simmons being bad offensively made Joel a better player.  I wouldn’t have expected embiid to become a top 5 midrange shooter after his rookie season"
"Sure, if I’m trying to have Joel Embiid retire from the sport of basketball."
"I brought up the Free throws as just one example of why you could run it back. You can “dig into” it as much as you’d like, but Ben Simmons shot historically bad from the line in the playoffs and it is extremely unlikely that he will shoot 35% from the line in another playoff series.   There are other reasons why you can run it back. Joel Embiid is a year old but has improved every year and I fully expect him to do so this offseason. Tyrese Maxey showed promise and could potentially share some of the ball handling duties with Ben — something most Sixers fans have been asking for since Boston exposed his half court flaws his rookie year. Tobias Harris had a 4 point game in a 3 point loss at home. That was quite literally his worse shooting performance of the year in one of the most important games of the year. $36million cannot equal 4 points, and I don’t expect it to again, Tobias played pretty well outside of that game. Danny Green going down with a coach that is NOTORIOUS for not making adjustments was a deadly combination and we saw that when Lou Will was torching George hill and the second unit in the huge comeback win ATL had in Philly or when Huerter was absolutely cooking Seth on the offensive end.   Point being, the team underperformed and I think people focus on Simmons’ shortcomings because they are glaring and have been around since he entered the league. Running back the #1 seed from a year ago retooled with Niang and Drummond could still be a contender."
"&gt;For most of his childhood, Embiid applied his talent to volleyball. As late as 2011, when he was 15 years old, he was still serious about volleyball and considered training for Cameroon’s national team in Europe, reports ESPN.  &gt;Embiid’s family, particularly his father, strongly encouraged him to stick with volleyball. Thomas even told him that nobody in Cameroon played basketball. Volleyball was a popular sport with a competitive standing in the country. At that point, Embiid had only played basketball for three months. [Source](https://www.sportscasting.com/joel-embiids-life-wouldve-been-much-different-if-it-werent-for-kobe-bryant/)  It was Embiid's primary sport for a long time."
"IDK I think it's pretty obvious when a team's third best player is Jimmy Butler or Joel Embiid, they're surefire contenders and probably favorites for the title if the KD warriors weren't around. If KD still gets injured, they're favorites over them. What's crazy is no team was willing to take a serious risk on Kawhi. Like I don't think there was even any buzz from the blazers about them giving up McCollum for him."
Maxey is going to be just fine and tbh I’d rather CJ in your spot too but why would you ever assume a guy who averaged 8 points will be become a sub all star. Joel Embiid doesn’t have infinite time you can’t fuck around for another year hoping Maxey will become that dude
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"No, I'm a lifelong fan. The suggestion that Embiids turnovers are a comparable issue to Simmons' inability to function in the half court is fucking joke.   Joel has lost us a few games that way over the years. Meanwhile, Ben's deficiencies have crippled our ability to build a team because it's really hard to build around a ""point guard"" who can't do basic point guard things.   On top of that Embiid improved as a passer out of doubles last year. The fact that you think these two things are comparable is laughable. I'm done."
"No clue, but he was the 3rd star on a championship team last year.  Last I checked, Simmons couldn't even help Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris get past the 2nd round."
Joel Embiid has more playoff series wins than the entire Timberwolves franchise history.
"I think for Philly fans it's more that many of us don't see a championship coming from Embiid and CJ. Lots of Philly fans still holding out hope for a dame/beal calibre player, but I think that's long gone. I don't see our chances being any better with Ben than with CJ, and if Joel can put out more seasons like this last one, and stay healthy in the playoffs, I think we will have a very good shot for the next 3-4 years regardless of whether we have Ben or not."
"Yeah Mitchell's height is tricky. He was measured 6'1.25"" at the 2017-2018 combine. He looks way too big to be just 6 foot. I think his 6 foot listing was an honest listing mistake. Him having a gargantuan wingspan + tall hair, gives the illusion of him being taller than just 6'1"".   Yeah, LeBron is 100 percent not 6'9"". Look at him next to AD or KD, who are listed at 6'10"". They are clearly more than an inch taller than LeBron. And the funny thing is, AD actually got a 6'9.75"" barefoot measurement and KD a 6'9.5"" barefoot measurement in the 2019 listings, so you could argue even they aren't legit 6'10"" guys. But they still look sustainably taller than obviously inflated 6'9"" LeBron.   Ben Simmons actually, is officially listed as 6'11"" by nba.com and the 76ers in 2021...The funny thing is, he is nowhere near a legit 6'11"":  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/ben-simmons-and-joel-embiid-of-the-philadelphia-76ers-pose-for-a-on-picture-id1172919448?s=612x612  Embiid is 6'11.75"" barefoot and he towers over Simmons, who has a bogus 6'11"" listing.    Kuzma's 6'10"" listing came out of NOWHERE. He was measured 6'8"" barefoot when he was drafted at 22 (98 percent chance he was absolutely done growing), and got a whole 2 inches randomly added to his height..."
Joel Embiid is a solid guy.
"Blaming a player for not being as good as they can be is idiotic?  Are people not blaming Anthony Bennett for being a bust?  You’re jumping to all these wild statements in your response I can’t even take you seriously, like obviously no ones blaming embiid for not being curry.   All I’m going to say is there’s middle school and high school kids that are better shooters than Simmons. That’s not the same as the difference between Joel embiid and steph currys levels. The fact that he didn’t improve at all over his career is unaccountable for any team that would have drafted him."
"https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid  ""Two days after that 2018 loss to the Celtics, the Sixers held exit meetings in their Camden, New Jersey, training facility. Each player was given a four-page document containing individualized offseason plans. For Simmons, the list of priorities included free-throw shooting, finishing at the rim and developing a jump shot. In that order.   After the meetings, Brown told reporters during a news conference that he expected Simmons to spend ""intense time"" with Townsend in the offseason.""  ""Simmons’ agent, Rich Paul, and family had decided that he’d be better off working with one of his brothers, Liam, a former low-level Division I guard and assistant coach, who now coaches at Division II Colorado Christian University. ""  This shit has been reported constantly for years."
"He wasn’t great at drafting. I don’t think many sixers fans would argue that he was. But being great at drafting wasn’t his strategy - the strategy was to get as many high draft picks as possible, so that eventually some had to hit.   He did a really, really great job at that. Before Colangelo came in, we had 10 first round picks over the next five years. Ten!! In addition, of course, to a number of tradeable, talented young players. Oh, and Joel Embiid. So you’re half-right about the rose-colored glasses thing, I think. Sixers fans (including myself) don’t see Hinkie for what he was, but only because they see him for what he could’ve been, before his vision was dismantled."
"Nah i agree, them selling him short was one of the dumbest thing ever, esp when doc was spewing on that if youre criticising ben on not shooting then you know nothing about basketball.   Doc is a really overrated coach, he has blown the highest amount of 3-1 leads, and the only ring he got was bcz of KG who is the king of ra ra speeches, the very thing that doc was claiming to be overrated during the clippers time  the fact that ty lue did so much better than doc this season already proves hes overrated  Embiid has back peddled on his statement and kind of wants ben aruond still, because sixers without ben are still worse than sixers with him, unless they get some good guards that can support joel"
"I think rebuilding teams should keep stock piling picks and young players until they hit on the right one. Trade any attractive piece (over 26) for assets.  I think OKC are on the right path. They are the perfect example on how a small market team should rebuild.  Rockets also had took 4 guys in the first round this year and have two FRPs next year. Magic also did great by trading Vucevic for two firsts   Philly took the same approach. They made a bunch of mistakes but they still ended up with Joel Embiid. There’s a universe where Embiid, Jaylen Brown and Tatum are on the Sixers."
"CJ is available for trade and we're ""waiting on"" Joel Embiid, sources say /s"
"Not true, I have to disagree.    The team have been propping up Ben ever since he's been in the league.   He's gotten top minutes, credit and glory of a top player and is paid like one too.   This is on Ben.   Doc gave him the green light to shoot more and from range, Ben decided not to.   It wasn't Doc or the team that shot 30% from the line in the playoffs, it was Ben.   It wasn't the team that decided not to abuse a 6'1 guard on the blocks, it was Ben.   The team didn't pass up dunks out of fear of getting fouled, it was Ben.    With the big money, the All Star appearances and the endorsements of a superstar,, also come the pressure and expectations of a superstar.     There is absolutely nothing stopping him from hiring a real shooting coach (that's not his brother) to help him.   Nothing stopping him from practicing hitting 500 free throws after each practice.   He's played with and have coaches that are/were elite shooters.  How do you play with  JJ Redick, Seth Curry, Danny Green and not ask then for tips and help?   Embiid worked on his game as an All Star.   The Joel of the past season is miles better than the Embiid of 2 seasons ago.   This is all on Ben and this is coming from a huge Simmons fan."
I’m not the biggest Embiid fan but today’s were extremely telling about the character of both of them:  JOEL EMBIID TOOK MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEN SIMMONS SHITTY PERFORMANCE THAN BEN SIMMONS!! (Sorry idk how to use bold on Reddit mobile so I guess I’m yelling)   That right there is the difference between a franchise player and a dude who’s in it just to tap kardashian ass
But what are Joel Embiid's sources that Joel Embiid is the one that said that?????
"This was Joel Embiid literally yesterday ""it's on me personally. I hope everyone is back cuz we know we're good enough to win"". Maybe you're the one just waking up from the coma?"
"&gt;For clarity, I love the criticism, I love when I’m told I can’t do something. It makes me work harder to prove everyone wrong but not everyone is built like that.  ESPN be like : ""Joel Embiid says that Ben Simmons can't take criticism."""
"r/nba: Man Joel really hates Ben lol, he's roasting him!   also r/nba: Embiid is right, the media totally blew his comments out of proportion. Never understood the appeal of the senseless media's clickbaiting."
"“Trust Me Bro”, says Joel “The Process” Embiid. Aka, “Trust the Process”."
"What do you mean by rich then ? Just because his father isn't 6 figures dollars rich (which might be the case, we don't know) doesn't mean he wasn't rich. The standards vary with countries. Upperclass people in cameroon (or let's say Ivory Coast as well) can afford sending kids to the US. A guy like Joel could've developped there, especially with his size. Would he be the Embiid we know today ? We don't know."
"The difference is that MCW was a case of a bad team letting a guy jack up shots, and so his advanced stats were awful. Meanwhile, Ben looked like a future perennial All Star, while the 6ers were a 50 win team. Also, this isn't 2k- who knows if Joel Embiid is fine with losing year after year and just decides to leave?"
"Lmao it's not at all, but it's been repeated enough times with more and more vitriol that these guys would quote it from memory as:   ""Ben Simmons is a garbage human being and basketball player and I hope his death is slow and painful""   \- Joel Embiid, Doc Rivers, and Daryl Morey is unison while holding hands."
"Embiid pretending like his post-playoff comments didn't severely exacerbate the situation is completely disingenuous. Not sure how anyone can see this as ""Joel shutting down FAKE RUMORS."" He said what he said about Simmons very publicly."
"Some would say I screwed Ben Simmons. Ben Simmons would definitely tell you I screwed him. I look at it from a different standpoint. I look at it from the standpoint of the referee did not screw Bret Hart. Joel Embiid certainly did not screw Bret Hart. Nor did Doc Rivers screw Bret Hart. I truly believe that Ben Simmons screwed Ben Simmons. And he can look in the mirror and know that.   I will certainly take responsibility for any decision I ever made, I never had a problem doing that. Not all of my decisions are accurate, they’re not. But when I make a bad decision, I’m not above saying that I’m sorry and trying to do the best about it that I can. Hopefully the batting average is pretty good, I make more good decisions than I do bad decisions. And as far as screwing Ben Simmons is concerned, there’s a time honored tradition in basketball, that when someone is leaving that they show the right amount of respect to the players, in this case to the people that made you that superstar. I mean you show the proper respect to the organization that helped you become who you are today. It’s a time honored tradition and Ben Simmons didn’t want to honor that tradition.   That’s something I would have never ever expected from Ben, because he’s known somewhat as a traditionalist in this business. It would have never crossed my mind that Ben wouldn’t want to show the right amount of respect to the players that helped make him and the organization that helped make him what he is today. I know that was Ben's decision. Ben screwed Ben."
Joel finna self rep his own super max and keep Ben and Maxey in Philly until he damn well says otherwise.  Rich Paul in tatters.  Long live Commissioner Embiid.
"I think even now when we looked back, at first it seems like Ben was the mature one while Joel was always immature with the trolling but you look how they conduct themselves, Embiid ALWAYS talked about improving himself and working hard despite his shenanigans while Ben was an entitled, arrogant player at every stage.  It makes sense too because they come from wildly different situations."
"you aren't capable of critical thinking, are you. who is more likely to push an agenda to gain leverage, a beat reporter who makes a living off of bullshit takes because that is what gets clicks and furthers his career, or joel fucking embiid who had nothing to lose when it comes to telling the truth?"
Everyone on the team not named Joel Embiid is expendable. I never said that the team values Simmons as much as Embiid nor did I say that Simmons wasn’t expendable. You’re quite literally arguing against points I’m not trying to make.
"i’m pretty sure Joel Embiid runs his own twitter man lol what other NBA player is tweeting RATIO  did Daryl suggest something like this? maybe, but these are definitely his own words. Don’t think i’d like it if people were using my name to lie for clicks either"
"Feel like it was only a few months ago you could still see some Sixers fans saying they'd rather keep Ben and trade Joel if they were forced to pick one because of Joel's injury history. Lots of credit to Embiid, he always seems to be working on improving his game"
Joel embiid is legit. Showing the next guy that he is a good teammate and that bum Simmons is the problem. Respect the move.
"Markelle Fultz and Ben Simmons were seen as the clear number 1 selections. Idk why you expect Hinkie to do something different, when he really hasn't shown any ability to draft outside of Joel Embiid."
"Joel Embiid: Media makes up stuff and y'all believe them  r/NBA: ""JoEl iS sAyIng ThIs oNlY beCaUsE...""  Y'all need to grow up"
Joel Embiid risked his career playing on that knee while Simmons couldn't even risk going to the foul line. Embiid could have called Ben a big sloppy pussy in his post game interview and it would've been warranted.
"Joel Embiid just exposed this to be a complete lie on Twitter, makes you really wonder how much of this whole situation is BS"
Joel “Fake News” Embiid.   But I agree. Narratives and getting the headline dominate too much of our media space
He was asked if he thinks Ben Simmons could be a point guard for a championship team and he said idk the answer to that question. After that shitty series what else did u expect doc to say? Doc has been more than supportive to Ben even calling media members idiots for questioning how good Simmons can be. Now Joel embiid what he did was wrong.
"How do you explain 18-19 then?  [2019-20](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=ben+simmons+stats+without+joel+embiid+in+2019-20)  20.1/8.1/7.1/2.4/0.5 on 62/100 (lol)/65.3  [2018-19](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=ben+simmons+stats+without+joel+embiid+in+2018-19)  19.1/10.1/7/1.6/1 on 53.8/0/63.5  [2017-18](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=ben+simmons+stats+without+joel+embiid+in+2017-18)  16.2/8.9/8.4/1.7/1.1 on 54.7/0/53.9   Maybe he's suddenly got worse as a player, or maybe Doc might not have been the best coach for him."
"Regardless of the age of this post, his stats without Embiid don't matter. They clearly can't coexist and the choice is Joel 100/100 times."
"I bet Joel Embiid prayed every day for Ben Simmons to be ""average."" Maybe the Sixers could've made it out of the second round."
lol you can't just include his missed season in your calculation of games per season or ignore that last year was a shortened season.   That's literally like me saying that Joel Embiid averages only 37 games per season.  KD has played in 92% of playoff games. That's pretty reliable.
Embiid was even playing on a bad knee and he still was able to carry the sixers. A healthy Ben Simmons can't even do half what Joel can do.
"Bad article I think, written in bad faith:  ""Asked after Game 7 if Simmons could be a point guard on a championship team, Rivers said, “I don’t know the answer to that right now.”"" and   ""In his postgame press conference, Sixers star Joel Embiid opined, “I thought the turning points was when we – I don’t know how to say it – is when we had an open shot and made one free throw.”""  These are the author's examples of Ben being ""thrown under the bus"". When, if anything, Doc and Joel were being fairly protective of Ben; if either man wanted to, they could've put Ben on full blast right then and there. They didnt, because that's what's expected of them as coach and star speaking to media. They didn't *sugarcoat* things (Doc did a lil bit, I can't remember if it was before or after), but this isn't ""throwing under the bus"".  I do agree with the author that the 76'ers didn't do enough to force Ben to shoot, but what can they really do? Clearly the dude works on the shot -- nobody can force him to take them during an actual game except Ben. And he just...doesn't seem to want it. TBH, I think very few of us know what Ben wants except him.  However, he thinks highly of himself -- anyone forcing a trade and delivering a short list of teams has to; except unlike an A.D or a Harden or Kawhi, the confidence and the actions feel about as hollow as the shooting practice video's he puts out every off-season."
"Joel and the organization also defended Simmons for the previous 3 seasons. It's been year over year of his flaws being evident and no improvements whatsoever from him. Eventually Embiid will lose his patience with him, which is what happened."
"Joel Troel Embiid hasnt accomplished shit in this league. Ben probably just sees him as his peer. Which is too bad because Embiid really has the chance to do damge in this league if his teammates allow him to lead and buy into whatever Joel needs from them. Like I said tho, it's hard to be a leader when you havent really accomplished anything"
"Ok Darryl.    But seriously, I don’t think we go for a straight roster swap like that. I do like the thought this move signals that the Kings roster is basically one Joel Embiid away from being contenders lol"
Rich Paul and Adele are plotting a hostile takeover of the city of Philadelphia. Daryl Morey and Joel Embiid are spreading propaganda. The whole things gone mad
"Joel Embiid has never shot 40% from three in his career.  He only shot as many as 4 threes per game one season, which resulted in his worst ever 3P% at 30%. What are you talking about?  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html"
Embiid and Simmons did work.  Sixers Net Rating in the regular season last year:  * Ben and Joel: +16 * Ben w/o Joel: -3 * Joel w/o Ben: +1  Sixers Net Rating in the playoffs last year:  * Ben and Joel: +18 * Ben w/o Joel: -9 * Joel w/o Ben: -4
"KAT has more gravity on the perimeter than Embiid. Not even knocking Joel because he’s also an elite offensive player, KAT is just better on the perimeter."
Embiid has never shot remotely close to 40% from 3 what are you talking about? KAT on the other hand has shot over 40% from 3 in 3 of the last 4 seasons on more attempts than Joel.
You're underselling it.  [He definitely has at least a foot long snake.](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/robert-covington-joel-embiid-sixers-python-snake-team-meeting/)
"so what, he hates Embiid then? because Joel was saying similar things"
Ya you could just stick 30 million on the bench every year and fight for the sixth seed while Joel Embiid sits out with injuries.
"If Kings take out Bagley and put it Barnes, I think that’s better.  Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid is not great defense but might be good enough and that’s some elite shooting around Joel."
How many African players in NBA history are better Joel Embiid?
"What were they supposed to do Ben? They begged you to improve in private for 4 years.  How he expected his organization to say he’s a championship PG with a straight face is beyond me.  We all watched 7ft 280 pound Joel Embiid fucking isolate, not post up, ISOLATE, damn near from the 3pt line while Ben sat dunker spot. All freaking playoffs.  Championship PGs don’t sit dunker spot! They score the ball!   Your team had to rely on Embiid, rookie Maxey, and Seth putting in on the deck to score.  Championship PGs don’t rely on their big, a rookie, and a role player to create shots for them!  How in the world Ben in surprised he finally got publicly shamed is beyond me."
Joel “no fucks given” Embiid
RIP Joel Embiid
"&gt;Joel ""Troel"" Embiid  ☑️"
- Joel “Troel” Embiid.
Y’all the one thing I think we all forget is that this whole situation was COMPLETELY avoidable lol. Doc and Embiid threw him under the bus and shot themselves in the foot here. They could’ve kept their cool and traded Ben behind the scenes and maximized his value but Rivers and Embiid both are too emotional to realize you can’t just throw a guy with a much smaller role under the bus when you’ve had 8 TO’s &amp; the other dude is a coach who doesn’t actually know how to coach when it matters.   Joel and Doc have no one to blame but themselves for their team getting weaker this offseason bc Sixers ain’t about to get back shit for Ben lol. This is self inflicted in the dumbest way possible &amp; might be the end of Embiid’s window in Philly (if there ever was one at all).
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.

"Hello, police? Joel Embiid tryna beat me up!"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/06/21/ben-simmons-joel-embiid/
The process is Joel Embiid
"I am surprised that some people write Dirk couldn't guard Embiid. Dirk held bigger centers and PFs to subpar shooting percentages for most of his career, while his weakness was shot-blocking, especially in help defense situations. Imo Embiid would have the same fate as Duncan, KG, Howard etc, who all looked only ok on offense vs Nowitzki and none of them was ever good at defense against him.  The real problem is AI. There is no way in hell, that Luka could stay in front of him and Dirk can't body Iverson like Joel, because of the huge speed disadvantage. Luka would obviously murder AI, but Embiid protects the rim, which means midrangers. Iverson might just have a lay-up festival.  Luka and Dirk would win the rebounding battle, but Embiid should be far better with putbacks.  Close call, but I just doubt Luka and Dirk could force AI into bad shots, so this would probably hinge on Iversons willingness to never settle for bad jumpers."
"Neither team can guard the other. Luka can’t guard stay in front of AI and when he gets by him, Dirk can’t defend the rim. So AI would dominate offensively and get easy layups.  AI has no prayer of guarding Luka but at least Joel can defend the rim. All in all I think AI gets an easy layup or dump off to Embiid every time. Luka/Dirk would have to depend more on jumpers, but of course 3&gt;2  It would be a good game But I’d go with AI and Embiid because their scoring would be easier, they’d get layups or drop off dunks everytime."
"Wrong year homie, this was the year they drafted Jahlil Okafor (big oof), not Joel Embiid. The already knew Embiid was out well in advance. Even with Saric they knew he wouldn't report for a while (not to mention that he drafted Saric over Lavine and Warren). Those are really poor excuses, Hinkie had so many chances to improve the team and instead he kept making bad draft choices and refusing to sign FAs."
Milwaukee for sure. Brooklyn will have trouble with their size since they still lack depth in their 4/5. I think Philly will test them a bit if Joel Embiid can make it to the playoffs healthy. I dont see any series going past 6 though.
"Joel Embiid. One of the greatest Super Bowl wins of all time. Uuuhhhh cheesesteaks. Shit I’m drawing a blank here, help me out man."
"CJ McCollum's stint in Portland all but over; Blazers looking at Joel Embiid  See, I can make up bullshit that isn't actually happening too."
Rockets looking at Joel Embiid  Cc: u/dmorey
James Harden could have been a Sixer with Joel Embiid? Woah that would have been a fun watch. Losing Thybulle would've sucked but at least Harden would have put up points.
Joel embiid gets rid of his biggest nemesis for his biggest nemesis
"Yeah Jaden can’t be the centerpiece. Simmons does too many other things that lead to winning. The goal is to maximize Embiid’s window, which is now. The Sixers can’t have all of the warts from DLo and Prisoner #516839 if the goal is to maximize Embiid’s window, and Jaden just isn’t enough.   Truthfully, most of these Philly fans are idiots. I love Joel, but Jo+Dame with no bench (assuming all of our young talent is sent in that trade) isn’t enough to beat the Lakers or Nets.   WhAt iF ThOsE OtHer tEaMs hAvE inJuRiEs  Sure, it’s possible. But we have the KING of “what if” injuries in Embiid. He’s played in the playoffs four years; he’s been injured in all but one of them, when we got swept.   Sixers’ only chance to win a title is for Simmons to become a shooter. It’s not likely to happen, but it’s the only chance. Simmons the Shooter + Joel + all of the young talent could be enough to compete."
A bunch of teams just measured in shoes anyways though. I remember listed heights coming out that had centers listed taller than Embiid when it's clear as day that Joel was taller than them when you see them on the court.
Jimmy Butler   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Russell Westbrook   Damian Lillard   Luka Doncic   Joel Embiid
Centers with gravity do so much more for an offense than centers who can't do anything but catch lobs (and set screens I guess but not like Embiid can't do that). It's absurd that you're suggesting lobs are anywhere near as valuable as being a scoring threat from everywhere...Joel necessitates that multiple defenders are paying attention to him at all times or it's an easy bucket  &gt; Shooting is great but when you’re taking 3 threes w gane  So you're just ignoring his midrange and free throw shooting then? Trash argument
would love to bring him back on a buyout. the chemistry with embiid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just being able to get easy looks for joel again would be great. i miss the leaning threes too
dude really said better than embiid come playoff time. have you literally never watched us play in the playoffs? there is no more impactful player on D than Joel during that time
"Hard to say, I'd rather build a franchise around an Embiid type big man versus a Dwight type who was arguably a better defensive player than he was an offensive player.   Lets hypothesize Ben Wallace with post moves, versus Hakeem-lite with a better outside shooting game.  The first would be an amazing big man to pair with another star guard, and the latter would be someone you would want a good guard, but wouldn't need to be a star level player, just the right cast around them.  Dwight didn't have the suite of moves Joel has but he had a few go-to moves. Drop step baby hooks, even a few mid range jumpers.   Joel is bigger than Dwight, capable of doing wing player moves out from the 3 point line. That's a trip. Although Dwight was definitely more explosive than Joel at his prime.  Defensively that's tough. Dwight as a defensive big man could be top 20 all time. Where on that list I don't know, but he should be there."
"Damn I think it’s at least close  Embiid is putting up 30.2 on 64.6% TS vs Dwight’s 22.9 on 61.6% TS  Obviously Dwight wins in the rebounding category, but Joel is putting out 2 more assists.  I’ll take Dwight on defense, but I’m not sure the gap is enough to make up that scoring differential. Give me Joel, at the risk of going against the grain here."
"Most teams in the NBA play drop coverage now, I don't think your team is going to see much different against the sixers schemes. The Celtics are sitting 12th in offense (not 16th, that's defense) with a 112 oRTG against drop coverage with those same pull up shooters. It's the playoffs so really any team can beat any other team in the east, but I think looking at the games when Ben and Joel play those pull up shooters have not really been the death of us. I think Boston has a lot more to worry with our size and Embiid playing at an MVP level than we do with Kemba/Tatum taking pull up jumpers.  I just don't think you'll see a vastly improved offense playing against us, and 112 won't get it done IMO"
"The Embiid thing is also fascinating because in retrospect, it makes you think what would’ve happened had Jason Kidd had a Joel Embiid type post threat to play with in his career. Dirk was a mid range maestro that could post up from time to time. Plus, Kidd didn’t get him until the tail end of his own career."
17 minutes of Joel Embiid traveling.
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"Yeah, not sure what to do with that. Initially, I incorrectly gave Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons credit for leading the Sixers to the Conference Finals in 2019- when they really only went to the second round. So, based on that error, I had 25 players in the last 20 years-- which divided really cleanly in to 12.5% and a 1/8 chance of getting a player in the top ten who would take you the conference finals. Then, once people pointed out my mistake, I'm left with 23/200 players, which divides to 11.5% of the time... but saying you have a 1/8.695... chance to get such a player does not translate well. So I left it as ""roughly a 1/8 chance"" rather than get all precise (since this really isn't about exact precision, but more giving a rough idea of how often said outcome happened in the last 20 years). And it was fun. Too much work for me, but it makes me admire those who regularly put out top notch OC such as  [u/ZandrickEllison](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZandrickEllison/) and others."
It was a great move by Masai - they got one more good year out of Gasol who was just enough to slow down an Embiid that hadn't hit his prime yet.  Now there's nobody that can stop Joel.
"I would disagree. They are good but like Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris could take that cake."
Joel Embiid is a stronger and faster Olajuwon.
I think this is joel embiid
"It’s not enough for a center. When you have players like Joel embiid and nikola Jokic at 280, KP can’t even compete."
"What help are we suppose to include for harden? 2018? Chris Paul missed the last 2 games, they would have won. 2020? 2017? Which year do we use  All those rockets players were much worse on defense then the raptors players. Joel embiid, phillys best player, was locked up by gasol. Chris Paul stats are also inflated by game 6, games 1-5 he was absolutely abysmal and couldn’t hit or generate any points.  Also, in the 2019 finals, kawhis teammates stepped up tremendously"

"against toronto in 2019, joel embiid scored 17.6 ppg on 37/35/83 shooting and the series was a virtual tie. replacing the primary defender of joel embiid with an inferior option likely leads to the 76ers winning that series in less than seven and then who knows what happens vs the bucks."
"Don't blame you for having some homerism but that's an optimistic view, don't really see Joel Embiid having steph curry level impact. Even if they win the finals I don't see it. I mean they don't even have the best record in the league.  *Maybe* if they steamrolled through everyone on the way to a chip and Embiid is just going off every game. But as good of a season as he's having, it's not really anywhere near Steph's anomalies of a game-changing season."
We don’t win a ring without Gasol  He played a huge role in shutting down Embiid. Joel averaged **17.6** points after averaging 27.5 points that year
"No, he doesn’t want to be embarrassed by Joel Embiid"
"&gt;but i'm also not sure where the sixers would be without joel.  i did say this but i specified i'm not sure because i don't know how much worse.  if golden state didnt have steph for example, i wouldn't be surprised if they were around the rockets/kings.  if the nets didn't have harden, i wouldn't be surprised if they were hovering around 8th after this run of games without KD.  same with CP3 and phoenix.   but if i take embiid out of the sixers lineup, i think they're still a team around 4-5th with simmons, curry, harris etc doing their thing. i might be wrong of course"
"i don't like embiid and i still don't have arguments against him. i think he's more deserving of it than giannis was the last two seasons tbh, he and jokic have been so dominant but embiid has the seed so...  the only argument i can come up with is that it should go to the player who elevates their team the most regardless of seed. that could arguably be someone like steph, harden, chris paul. without those 3, i don't see the warriors, nets, or suns being as high as they are right now, but i'm also not sure where the sixers would be without joel."
"Potential? I’d say he had higher offensive potential than either Embiid or Jokic, but it wasn’t the injures that kept him from reaching it but rather his refusal to buy into team philosophy and stop playing selfishly. His assist numbers doesn’t mean he wasn’t a selfish player, he dominated possessions, played hero ball and was a high TO player. He was a losing player in SAC, I don’t think he ever won more than 25 games there. I was rooting for the AD/Boogie combo but as dominant as that front court appears on paper they were essentially a .500 team and I think they even had a better record after he went down with injury. Ended up sweeping the first round too.   But as for skills he certainly has it all, he was a better ball handler than Joel and more athletic than Jokic but was more concerned with his stats than winning. Even with all that potential I don’t consider him close to those 2 centers in actual impact."
" ""Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid overtook Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James last week and is now the consensus favorite to win the regular-season MVP award at sportsbooks around the nation. Embiid is listed at +200 to win MVP at Caesars Sportsbook by William Hill, followed by James at +225.""    What does it mean to be a consensus favorite? It seems that he is not that at all if James is in a near tie with him."
"Joel Embiid has a 78% efg, which doesn’t account for free throws, where I’m pretty sure he’s like a 90% shooter in the clutch for his career.  Obviously Dame is the most clutch player in the league, one of the most clutch ever. But not damn if Joel ain’t 2nd or 3rd idk who is.  Edit: also props to Jerami Grant for being there, would’ve never thought that when he came in."
He was for the whole year until lakers went 3-7 in the last 10.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp%3fplatform=amp  media is ridiculous
There's this guy named Joel Embiid...  Also I don't see the media giving it to him after what he did with Houston
"[https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/12/watch-kawhi-leonard-buzzer-beater-takes-4-bounces-eliminates-76ers/)  Take a look at that photo. LOOK AT IT. Joel BARELY leaves his feet to defend that shot. Of those final 4 seconds, Ben Simmons, who had enough vert and height to block the shot, was on him for 3.5 seconds, but Embiid stepped in last second, botched the defense, and pretty much is the reason why the sixers lost.  Not to mention the whole team let Kawhi walk all over them all series, with that being the nail in the coffin. Thanks for the lazy defense Joel, and thanks for the shit coaching, Brett Clown. I hope you never coach an NBA game again."
"So? All that changes is the number of jerseys sold. If you're a fan of a player the reason behind you buying their jersey doesn't change depending on how good they are. If you're gonna buy their jersey, you're gonna buy their jersey. The reasoning doesn't change because they're a star; if somebody has an affinity towards Paul Reed or Joel Embiid it isn't different. Not everybody that loves Steph bought his jersey already in the past 6 years. It's absurd to think that like everybody who would buy a Rui jersey had already done so. Maybe people are just getting into it, maybe they can afford it now when they couldn't then, etc  I still buy Ronaldo jerseys and he hasn't played in over a decade. There's no new jerseys coming out, I don't grow more fond of him. The psychology of buying a player's jersey isn't so simple as ""I like him, I'll buy his jersey."" There's a ton of factors that drive consumers"
Joel Embiid too far down
Joel Embiid is dropping 30/12/3 on the same efficiency as Curry and a DPOY candidate.  Jokic is dropping 27/11/7 on even better efficiency than Curry.  Opinion moves slow but the future is already here.
Add Embiid to the list as well:  https://phillysportsnetwork.com/2021/03/09/joel-embiid-sweat/
"I’m guessing this comment will get lost bc of how many there are but Giannis literally won two MVP awards in a row without a jumper. Joel Embiid is a front runner rn and shooting is just a compliment to his strong inside/mid-range game. Obviously shooting now is much more of a bonus if you have the ability to space the floor for your/your teammates’ game(s) but there’s still such a variety of play styles in the league.   Look at Kobe in the 2000s, LeBron since his Heat days, Kyrie, CP3, etc. There’s still so much more to the game than just “go down the court, attempt a 3, get back and trust that you’ll average out more points than the other team trying to take whatever look they’re given.”"
"Even Embiid has a 3, which enables him to get by his guy. Look at how often he pump fakes at the top of the key and the other center takes one step forward, then Joel goes by him. No one ""only"" plays in the paint anymore. Such a player would have little value."
"I guess we should just go by the eye test and throw the stats out the window then? Face it, Ben Simmons benefits greatly by playing with Joel Embiid. The same cannot be said for Gobert benefiting from his teammates defensive prowess."
The next NBA patch is going to be sick. Threes will be worth 4 (now called Fours). Dunks 4. Anywhere else 3. This might bring the game some balance since the Curry legend is too OP. Look for Joel Embiid and Zion to be S-Tier soon!
"Because Lavine is shooting the best despite being the opposing team focus.  Mitchell has Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, Simmons has Joel Embiid and had Jimmy Butler, Brown has Tatum and vice versa and had Kyrie and Hayward, Booker was the same but now he has CP3.  Who was the best teammate Lavine had? Teammates matter and to disregard that is disingenuous to your own argument."
"[Check these stats from Joel Rush](https://twitter.com/JoelRushNBA/status/1369102106855018496)  &gt;If we can call 36 minutes per game a standard minutes load for NBA starters, then based on minutes this season, Nikola Jokic has played 36 games and Joel Embiid has played 27.5 games.  &gt;Btw, if this projects out to the end of the season, then Jokic would end up playing all 72 games, while Embiid at 55 would play 17 fewer than Joker -- nearly a whole quarter of the season."
"This and Joel Embiid, two things he’ll never be able to defend will live with him his entire career"
"[Wojnarowski] My sources are telling me that Joel Embiid is ""without a doubt"" the biological son of Hakeem Olajuwon."
"Team Durant was missing Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid and Booker...  That 20 point game would have been ALOT closer if they had two MVP candidates who combined are averaging 61/18/8 with elite defense...   Team LeBron was superior but let’s not pretend that team KD wasn’t massively short handed"
Joel Embiid
"Nah the data agrees with you.  Embiid rn is averaging better shooting percentages then hardens career high in percentages in everything other then FTs.  People confuse unstoppable- with offensive production.  Production in sports is mostly circumstantial, while unstoppable refers to what their skillset does in the context of a basketball play.  Like Lebron is more unstoppable then harden due to his athleticism and size, but harden plays off of actions that end up with him being more statistically productive then other players.  Both add insane offensive value to their teams, but one is more easily disgestible statistically then then other.  I think in terms of Moreys comment he’s saying how Joel is a unstoppable in the sense that you can’t guard him offensively due to his rare combination of athletic ability, size, and shooting ability.  He’s always going to get a good shot off, and if you don’t fouls when he backs you down he’s going to brutalize you down low.  Defensively he is like an NFL Free Safety in that he offers a level of protection to all wing players at the rim allowing them to sell out far harder on contesting jumpers having the understanding that any layup attempt is going to be sent into the first row.  Both of those are purely dependent on how Embiid is playing on a given night, and when he’s on their isn’t anyone in the league Rn that can do anything about him."
"&gt; Dwade was an ironman like kobe, never got injured, possibly Heat/Cavs ECF in 2007?, He was out for most of the year that time  As I see it, yes  &gt;Brandon Roy/Dame Lillard/Greg Oden big three  Ask again later  &gt;Kobe to the bulls in 06  As I see it, yes  &gt;Heatles go to Bulls instead of heat to team up with Drose  Without a doubt  &gt;Russell Westbrook drafted by the Heat in 11' and keeps his college defense prowess and improves upon it  Very doubtful  &gt;KD stays in OKC  It is decidedly so  &gt;OKC trio stays in general  Yes  &gt;Kyrie and Klove never got injured in 15' finals  Better not tell you now  &gt;Gilbert Arenas playing into this era  Better not tell you now  &gt;Chris Bosh never got his blood clot  Better not tell you now  &gt;Demarcus Cousins staying healthy on either warriors or Lakers and still playing at a high level  My sources say no  &gt;That sixers lineup of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid stayed together  Don't count on it  &gt;Curry to the Hornets (or was it Knicks, Timberwolves who could pick him? Any trash team really)   Most Likely  &gt;MJ drafted by the blazers  Outlook good  &gt;KD drafted by the blazers  Yes  &gt;Drazen Petrovic never got into that fatal car accident  Very doubtful  &gt;Steve Nash never got injured on the Lakers  You may rely on it  &gt;Shaq had the drive to improve like Kobe/MJ/Lebron etc  Ask again later"
Is Joel Embiid the biological son of Hakeem Olajuwon?
"Joel Embiid for Big Jim, who says no?"
I think it’s more civil than it may otherwise be because both teams are just relieved/amazed that their guy is finally reaching his maximum potential   Embiid was always highly touted but a gigantic “if” (and probably always will be while he’s still active) who is finally putting together a complete season at the peak so many people said he might never get the opportunity to reach   Jokic was a late draft pick who was internally hyped from early on but underrated by the league all the way up until somehow right now lol  As a sixers fan I’m just proud of our big goofy boys (but I’ll be said if Joel doesn’t win of course)
Like Joel Embiid?
1. Joel Embiid 2. Ben Simmons 3. Tobias Harris 4. Shake Milton 5. Danny Green 6. Mattise Thybulle 7. Seth Curry 8. Dwight Horward 9. Furkan Korkmaz 10. Mike Scott  Haven’t seen George Hill yet but I’d imagine he slides in right under Seth

Malone would be a small ball center in today league. He’d be super switchable on defense as well. It’d be like if Draymond was Joel Embiid on offense (minus the three point shot).
Sounds like Joel Embiid to me 🤔
Projected starting lineup    Ben Simmons  Khris Middleton  Tobias Harris  Giannis  Joel Embiid   Sounds pretty sexy ngl
This post makes it sound like the guy's like Joel Embiid and missed 3 seasons.  His rookie season was LAST year lol
&gt;Nikola Jokic 4.2   &gt;   &gt;Joel Embiid 3.7  Jokic has had two games of 0 free throws in like the past week and a half.     Embiid has had one game of 0 free throws his entire career.
Joel Embiid would like to have a few words about that statement.
"Russ is the only one who seems like the odd man out there, Either Luka or Trae takes a hit from not being on-ball all the time there, but you do have the same Spain pick and roll/ double drag action the Hawks already run with Jayson Tatum instead of John Collins and Joel Embiid instead of Clint Capela which seems like a lethal action that they could run as frequently as they wanted."
"EASILY. Literally Joel Embiid but better in literally every facet. And he's the #1b center right now. And I wholly believe Hakeem could've easily stretched it out to the three in today's game, dude's middy was WET."
Joel Embiid in three years if he doesn’t knock it off with the extra nonsense :/
Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid
"What you're looking for are superstar/star players who run their teams offense and/or rarely play off-ball *or* focus on creating their own shot.  For example, the best-worst team (with some wiggling of positions) I can think of would be;  PG: Trae Young  SG: Russell Westbrook  SF: Luka Doncic  PF: Jayson Tatum  C: Joel Embiid  To be fair Embiid would probably slot in alright, but in terms of star C's it's really either him or Jokic and I worry the latter would be able to corral the rest of the time into playing well off-ball."
Joel Embiid just capped off a prime David Robinson level season and most people don’t have him in the top 8
"It’s always hilarious how people claim that the league today isn’t immensely more talented than it ever was when guys like Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Damian Lillard are lower top ten."
Joel Embiid stilll had the torn meniscus and Danny Green was pretty important to that team. Yeah the Hawks won on the road a bunch but 2-3 of those wins seemed like the sixers fell asleep after being up so much and taking their foot off the gas.
"7 new teams were added between 67 and 71, including 3 right before the 71 season.   Also your kind of contradicting yourself here. Doesn't more teams mean the talent is more spread out? I mean in an 8 team league Bill Russell would have to face one of Wilt Chamberlain, Nate Thurmond, Willis Reed, Wayne Embry, Walt Bellamy, Zelmo Beaty or the Lakers any given game. That's a HOFer almost every night. And if you say these guys weren't talented, well that's just laughable and I'll just cut the conversation short there.   Compare that to say Joel Embiid today who's only real HOF-level opposition is Jokic and Gobert, and he only plays them twice a year. The rest of his schedule is filled up with the Plumlees and Valanciunases of the world."
&gt;  I fully expect Joel to win MVP if he doesn't miss too many games.  That’s the problem. Embiid in his career has never missed less than 18 games with his last two shortened seasons hes missed 21 and 22 games. Now without Simmons he’d have to carry the entire offense and pick up some defensive slack and it’s an 82 game season. The last MVP to miss more than 10 games was ironically AI all the way back in 2000 who only missed 11. I can’t see Embiid jumping from 51 games the past 2 seasons to 71.
You're forgetting Ben is (in)directly holding Embiid hostage. It's only a matter of time until Joel gets even more fed up with this than he already is and will want out of this shit.  Eventually the Sixers will have to concede to the cents for a dollar trade
Al horford and joel embiid.
"Am I crazy for thinking of keeping Embiid over Iverson circa 2000? Yes I suppose. But a one for one trade would lead to all kinds of problems, particularly defensively. No Mutumbo waiting behind Joel."
"Peak vs. Peak, it's not close at all. Joel Embiid will never be able to switch onto James Harden/ RWB consistently, but AD has..."
"1. Kevin Durant | Brooklyn Nets: 45 points (38.9% first-place votes)  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo | Milwaukee Bucks: 38 points (33.3% first-place votes)  3. Luka Doncic | Dallas Mavericks: 35 points (16.7% first-place votes)  4. Joel Embiid | Philadelphia 76ers: 14 points (5.6% first-place votes)  5. James Harden | Brooklyn Nets: 11 points (5.6% first-place votes)  6. Stephen Curry | Golden State Warriors: 10 points  7. LeBron James | Los Angeles Lakers: 7 points  Those are  the MVP predictions and the Nets are #1 for Champion with 80 points,Lakers 2nd with 49,Bucks 3rd with 30 and nobody else got more than 4 points in the vote"
"Embiid really didn’t blame him.  He took more blame than he assigned, and all he said was the truth: the turning point was when we had a wire open dunk and only scored 1 point on free throws, and then Joel went down on the other end and turned the ball over."
al horford and joel embiid
"Sure, he could. And if he does that he’s essentially ending his own career. Cause again, that level of unprofessionalism is not something teams wanna deal with, and he’s not a good enough player to make them look past it like they did with harden. It just tanks his value even more too, meaning philly is even less likely to budge if they have to attach assets to him to trade him. And his trade value is clearly something he should carry about since it’s what determines whether he gets traded or not, which is what he wants.  Obviously they’d have to get the ok from Embiid since he’s their future. Considering all the sacrifices Joel has made for Ben, and then the way Ben completely ghosted him afterwards and left him and his team hanging, I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t care. Especially since Philly’s cap situation with or without Ben doesn’t change that much for the next year or two.   Nobody’s gonna trade for an overpaid point guard with a big ego and a shitty work ethic that can’t shoot, that also has proved himself to be completely unprofessional by intentionally going out of his way to play poorly. When you’re a borderline top 35-40 player and not an actual superstar, you don’t have the luxury of taking all these hits to your stock and remaining a valuable asset"
"Have you actually read the quotes that are being considered ""shit talk?""  ""I’ll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we – I don’t know how to say it. But I thought the turning point was just, we had an open shot and we made one free throw and we missed the other and then they came down and scored and we didn’t get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he made a 3 and then, from there down four. And then I got – it’s on me. I turned the ball over, tried to make something happen from the perimeter.""       -Joel Embiid   In what way is he shit talking him?"
What about Joel embiid? Being the only team to win in Milwaukee against Giannis?
"I appreciate the research and thought that went into this post first and foremost. And you make a lot of good points. I don't disagree too heavily with anything you said. I just think that we are talking about slightly different things.   I am mainly responding to the people who say Ben will just not show up to games. That never happens. Do I think Ben will show up and put his body in the line for the Sixers? Or try and rehab his trade value? No I do not. But people on here were literally talking about him standing on the court doing nothing or shooting at the wrong basket or just guarding no one on defense. As if being murdered by Joel Embiid is worth whatever point he'd be trying to make.   Also a little disrespectful of you to not mention Forkan Korkmaz when discussing players who demanded a trade but still showed up and played hard. Kobe is a good example too I guess, if you want to go real deep in the weeds."
"Sixers are really fucking around. If I were joel embiid and my team is refusing to get a return for simmons during my prime, id request a trade. They have joel embiid, move the fuck on and do what u can to keep him happy."
"Joel Embiid is coming to the Blazers. Run from it, hide from it, it's happening either way. You heard it here first.  See, I can smoke crack and say incredibly dumb ass shit on the internet too. GG."
"He’s 21/5/6 guy that can play good defence and shoot. Offensively it’s a huge upgrade from Ben, not only in the players themselves but it benefits Joel Embiid immensely and allows him to play even better, or perhaps play at the same level but have an easier time which saves energy for defence.   And defensively, Ben literally doesn’t move the needle for philly. He’s nothing but a 1v1 defender which teams can easily counter, so on and off the floor philly is more or less the same without him. Plus, bens absence means Thybulle can play more minutes without killing space and he can probably replicate any losses Ben brings at that end"
Paul Pierce on rising Joel Embiid.  “I’m tired of getting alil taste of him.  I want the whole load.”
"Draymond, Joel, and Klay are all really top level defender. And Draymond is nearly as good of an all ball defender as Simmons.  But I do take your point. Klay can guard Harden, and Steph Irving, and a tobi + embiid combo is probably enough to stop ad and bron from getting easy drives. But who is going to stop KD? I think I'd rather try to out offense KD then rely on stopping his shooting with any defender, but Simmons is the best KD defender that exists right now."
KPJ will win an MVP before Joel Embiid ever gets a point guard on his roster.  Change my mind.
Joel Embiid has had some terrible offensive tools on his team lmao.
PG - De'Aaron Fox ($3)  SG - Bradley Beal ($8)  SF - Jayson Tatum ($7)  PF - Draymond Green ($3)  C - Joel Embiid ($9)
"Steph Curry: Game 2 2015 Finals going 19 points on 5/23 from the field and 2/15 from 3 in an OT loss. Probably one of the big reasons that that lost him out a Finals MVP.   James Harden: Game 6 2017 WCSF. 39-point blowout loss against the Spurs without Kawhi at home, 2/11 from the field, 6 turnovers, just 10 points and fouling out. Statistically he had bigger stinkers this past ECSF against Milwaukee but he was clearly injured then.   KD: Many will say the 2016 WCF but statistically Game 2 of the 2016 First Round series was much worse. 7/33 from the field, 2/11 from 3, 21 points and 7 turnovers.   LeBron: Game 4 2011 Finals. 8 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 turnovers in a 3-point loss as part of the worst series of his career.  Kawhi &amp; PG: Game 7 2020 WCSF. Combined 10/38 from the field, 4/18 from 3, including 2/18 from the field in the second half and 0/11 for 0 points in the 4th quarter. 7 combined turnovers as well.  Joel Embiid: Game 4 2021 WCSF. 17 points on 4/20 from the field, 0/12 in the second half including blowing a wide open layup to take the lead at the near end of the game."
[Joel Embiid](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201911250TOR.html): 0/13/2
Joel Embiid 0 points
We live in a world where Joel Embiid hits more threes (&gt; 0) at a higher clip than the starting PG and the starting PG finished higher in DPOY than Joel Embiid.  The 76ers are the NBA version of the Upside Down.
"John wall and joel embiid, deadly combo there 76'ers fans lets make this 3 team trade happen.  /s"
"If Simmons is this upset over the very, very mild criticism that came from doc Rivers in Joel embiid, how do you think he's going to feel when he disappoints and frustrates the team he gets traded to? His future teams fan base is not going to wait very long before proclaiming him a failure and a waste of money."
"Your acting like wade didn’t average 30 points per a game and lead his team to an nba title….  Wade was an all nba defender, harden is a non factor on defense. So again the gap is massive. It’s like comparing Joel embiid to Jokic and claiming there isn’t a massive gap in defense"
"No, he actually swept Damian Lillard and the Blazers then went on to steal a game in a series against arguably the greatest NBA team ever assembled.     Embiid has never made it out of the second round with a much better supporting cast and in a weaker conference. AD is a better all-around player and a top 2 defensive anchor in the league when healthy. Joel just doesn’t contribute to winning in the same way"
"I really hated how the Philly organization tried to drag my team's good name into their dysfunction by insinuating that we were pursuing Simmons. I also hated how the organization gave in to the pressure and pushed Hinkie out. Everything since then has been a shitshow. Jimmy Butler was right, and Joel Embiid deserves to play for a better organization. And you, random Philly fan, deserve a better organization to support. It's just laundry."
"Half is too high but he’s definitely in the 18-25 range. Players I’d definitely take over him:  1) Lebron 2) Giannis 3) Curry 4) Harden 5) AD 6) Jokic 7) Luka 8) Dame 9) Kawhi 10) Jason Tatum 11) Joel Embiid 12) Zion 13) Donovan Mitchell 14) Kyrie 15) CP3 16) Paul George 17) Trae Young  I’d also struggle to put him over Devin Booker, Butler, And Beal."
"Joel Embiid &gt; Anthony Davis  I don’t think this is a super hot take, but my reasoning towards it probably is.  Anthony Davis is absolutely not a top 5 player in the MVP and should have never been an MVP candidate at any point in his career so far.  Don’t get me wrong, he’s *very*, *very* good. Easily one of the best bigs in the game, but throughout his career he’s shown that he does not impact winning in the same way other superstars do, Like KD, Lebron, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Lillard, etc. All of the dudes listed have carried teams to the playoffs and to the Finals, and AD is talked about like he belongs in this conversation with these guys, yet, even now on the Lakers, when Lebron is out/off the floor, the team is no better than all of his mediocre Pelicans teams. Superstars are supposed to be good enough to prevent such a steep drop off from when their co-star goes down. Just look at what PG13 did in the playoffs when Kawhi went down, or how the Nets record didn’t get any worse when the Nets were without one or both of KD and Kyrie win a stretch where Harden led the team. It would be one thing if the Lakers were significantly worse without AD on the floor too, but they’re not, and sometimes they’re better."
Sixers trying to big dick this and literally waste a year of Joel Embiid to prove some kind of point is definitely a strategy!
"If Sixers do that , they will waste having one of the top MVP candidate in Embiid. That's Ben's leverage. That Sixers can't afford to just waste a season or more and piss of Embiid. Not to mention other players or people in the organizations who just want to win and move on. Sure they can go to playoff without Simmons but that will put a big load on Embiid and seeding matters too. Barely sneak into playoff and you can easily end up againt Nets in the first round.  If Sixers is a tanking team who doesn't care then sure. They can just run down Ben's contract and get a free max cap space at the end. But they are not. They are supposed to be in a tight window of competing while Joel is in his prime and most importantly under contract."
Obviously they're better with Beal but you know as well I as do that Jrue will lock him up the way he did Dame.   You have Giannis and Embiid matching production then it comes down to Middleton &gt; Harris. Lopez is also a better role player than Green.   Like obviously if Beal is available then try and get him. But if you trade Ben for young guys and picks next to Joel and Beal/Dame/LaVine don't ask out then Embiid is probably gone.
Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid and Danny Green are also players on the Philadelphia 76ers' roster.
"yo Dlo on the 6ers could be great. Goes all in on shooting/scoring around Embiid. Joel by himself is a passable defense + Green and Harris is solid enough and they have some specialists if needed (Thybulle) so I doubt defense will be a huge problem (except when Embiid sits...) and that starting 5 would be INSANE on offense. Dlo/Seth Curry/Danny Green/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid. You have 3 guys who can create, all 5 are respectable to great from 3, and you can spread the floor like crazy when Embiid wants to take over + if Dlo also can take over sometimes if Embiid can't for some reason.  Honestly that sounds like a load of fun please Morey do it!"
The center is tall and generally plays close to the net on offense and defense. Most likely not a great 3-point shooter although in recent years centers have gotten better at being all around players. E.g. Joel Embiid. He’s not Steph Curry from long range but he can shoot decently if he has to.   each position is numbered 1-5 for shorthand. The center is 5.
&gt; How you gonna build hype for a player that does not play.  Blake Griffin... Joel Embiid...
One of them has Joel Embiid
"This is basically what I've been saying whenever he is brought up in the Grizzlies subreddit when people suggest we should trade for him. If we were to acquire him, it would be if he and Jaren could play the 4 and 5 together.   There's a reason why Ben Simmons' career averages are higher without embiid.   &gt;Ben Simmons has averaged 18.2 points (15.1), 8.8 (8.1) rebounds and 6.9 (7.9) assists in 49 games without Joel Embiid between August 21, 2018 and August 21, 2021."
"Trae, he's too one dimensional.  I'll say a dominant wing instead of Embiid, so like a PG or Leonard. He doesn't listen to Joel"
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5). Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  6). Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  7). Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  8). James Harden, Brooklyn Nets  9). Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  10).

"Joel Embiid, cause he's elite at scoring and seems like a genuine cool guy."
"They do, but at the same time the media won't allow a player averaging 50/25/2 to not win MVP. By and large, there isn't really an MVP in the last 15 years that you can say the media got it completely wrong, there's debates here and there (2005 and 2011 come to mind), but that's to be expected when hundreds of people are voting.  Players aren't reliable for this, what are the odds that James Harden watches Luka Doncic night in and night out? Or that Joel Embiid watches Damian Lillard often. They have scouting reports, but these guys have more to do than watch the Mavs play the Kings in a random Wednesday night."
"J.Okafor, M.Fultz, B.Simmons, Joel ""Glass Kneed"" Embiid...the process."
Joel Embiid to the Hawks for Clint Capela it is

"He has shown he can't be in the 76ers. When Joel Embiid was out he was pretty good scorer. People blaming Simmons and only Simmons for the loss is just dumb.  Teams that would probably benefit with him:  TWolves keeping DLo and KAT.  Clippers tho they don't have space.  Kings, if he plays as a PF and Fox as a PG.  New Orleans potentially tho I don't know if that team is trying to end the damn rebuild or not.  Portland, if the keep Dame.  Mavs, tho I wouldn't give up on KP just yet.  Celtics.   Now the real thing is what would be fair to give, and I mean a Win/win situation or as balance as you can get. And for the most part, I think a ton of picks and two or 3 very decent players."
"you’re joking, but the whole process and watching okafor, fultz, simmons, etc has made me respect joel embiid so much more. The guy struggles mightily with injuries and still finds a way to get better every single year despite all the pressure."
"Everyone on here is just salivating at the thought of Embiid asking out, as if Joel isn’t the main decision maker for our franchise lol"
"At the same time, Embiid was playing so far away from the net in the playoffs in order to open up for Simmons's game that it goes from ""Ben and Joel cannot coexist"" to ""Joel is literally remodeling his game to accommodate Ben, who is too much of a fucking coward to attempt free throws — let alone a jump shot."""
Him and Fultz back to back....  Sometimes I wonder how the hell we fucked this up so bad and how we also had the #1 seed at the same time.   Thank God for Joel Embiid.
"I feel for Embiid because he’s become one of my favourite guys to watch and he clearly cares. I think he wants to stay and win in Philly. But the first overall pick, second best player on the team is not willing to get better. I wonder if Joel would leave at the end of his deal"
"Team offense is generally dependent on the team and how it's constructed. Bigs generally don't dictate the offense as much as guards, as they generally have more impact on the defensive end especially in previous eras without the 3 point shot.  I generally steer away from using team statistics to measure individual performance because context matters a lot in these discussions.  For instance, the Jazz had a much better offensive team than the Sixers. Does that mean Ruby Gobert is more impactful offensively than Joel Embiid? Hakeem's played on some awful offensive teams in the late 80s and very early 90s, does that mean he's not impactful offensive player?  Individual stats doesn't tell most of of the story, but it says a lot when one guy shoots 10 percentage points higher than another."
"The process hasn’t ended. Last time I checked the Sixers still have Joel Embiid. And no, this team isn’t anything like the pre-process Sixers"
"&gt;psychotic work ethic   Ben Simmons can't read this, hence it doesn't apply. Man, I look at players like Giannis and even Embiid and you can see desire and hunger to win and improve. Giannis literally turned himself into Steph Curry at the line when it mattered, despite being mocked, just because he wanted to win. Joel risked a severe, career-changing injury all because he wanted to win. Then you have Ben. Gifted with everything, loving fans, a city that embraces him, a franchise that wants him, coaches that care and protect him, and not an ounce of improvement. T"
"Simmons is a ridiculously talented player who can do just about everything except shoot the ball. Unfortunately that one critical flaw is a killer when you play next to a dominant big man like Joel Embiid who plays in the paint and needs shooters around him to space the floor. That issue gets amplified in the playoffs, the Sixers flamed out against Atlanta, a team they were heavily favored to beat and the whole relationship is falling apart now.  Simmons needs a bit of a reality check with some of the stuff he's saying, but the Sixers should've seen this coming, the Simmons/Embiid pairing has been destined to fail for multiple years. He should've been traded 1-2 years ago when he had more trade value."
"Sort of. He gets 25% of his payment up front according to the contract he’s threatening to breach, and they can’t take that back. And is Philly supposed to just deal with a dead max contract level chunk of their salary cap until Ben decides to work? As things stand, the Sixers get pretty heavily punished for not having him show up, they’re not allowed to move on with their roster construction or sign his replacement, they’re stuck in competitive limbo until it’s resolved. The same goes for Joel Embiid - are we all okay just letting him spend the next four years stuck on a lottery team that can’t afford to sign him a new costar because Ben doesn’t wanna work?   It’s not as simple as “take his money!” and yes, the league might need to get involved."
"There are teams that would kill for 3 years of bad 2nd round performances. Not every team has the same goals. A bottomfeeder team would absolutely pay him the max just to get them to the playoffs.  Not to mention he could work in the Draymond Green role on a different team. Part of the issue with the 76ers is roster construction. They're built around Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris. You've got a center and 2 PF as your 3 best players. That spacing is going to be horrendous. Put him on a team with actual shooters, where he can play some minutes as a small ball 5, and he could shine."
"He stands to lose a not insignificant amount of money ($33MM), but I think it's key to remember that he's already pocketed $90MM to this point, so a part of me thinks that this hurts Philadelphia more than it hurts him.   Philly has a window that is open right now, and they might not get a better crack at a championship. Joel Embiid, with his injury history, might not be in his prime for that much longer, and at the moment, Ben Simmons is a huge part of what the 76ers are. If he no shows, they're getting nothing for all of that money they have carved out of the salary cap for him. That's a lot of value that is just sitting somewhere outside of the arena, while precious weeks and months go by.  Philly could decide to hold firm, set their price and wait for another team to meet their demands, but how long do they want to wait it out? What happens if they're hovering around .500 and looking at a 4 or 5 seed in mid January? While Joel Embiid is growing frustrated by the national media's constant badgering of what he thinks about the Simmons drama?  I get it, everybody can see my Nets badge and assume I'm giving bad advice to the enemy (though I doubt Morey is reading this right now anyway), but I honestly think it's bad for business for them to wait too long, and I think Morey has overplayed his hand pretty drastically. But if they get Dame or Beal, I promise I'll take it all back."
"Joel just signed a max deal, if he was worried about what we were gonna do then he wouldn't have signed that, he just signed it weeks ago in the middle of this drama.  I'm not worried about Joel Embiid at all. He knows what's going on, he's well connected with the city and the franchise. Better players have dealt with worse situations.  I'm not making a deal in fear of Joel upset. He knows he's better off with another all star than he is with a bag of basketballs we get from some shit offer.  Embiid will force a trade down the road if we make a bad trade now."
Let’s guess today’s Ben Simmons update:  -	Timberwolves continue to lead the Ben Simmons race but neither party is close to an agreement -	Joel Embiid has reached out to Ben Simmons this week and still hasn’t received a response  -	Portland Trailblazers are still a dark horse favorite to land Simmons  -	Doc Rivers has not reached out to Ben and will coach the players that want to attend training camp  -	Maya Jama is pregnant
We have other assets to offer too.  James Harden was traded for without giving up a top 20 talent. So it's doable.  AD was traded for non top 20 players too.  I'd rather wait out a whole entire year than trade Ben for Pennies.  Joel Embiid is actually more than happy in Philly and he know trading Ben for a bag of shit isn't going to help him with a title either.  The shit offers we're getting at the moment isn't worth trading him for.
"The player empowerment jerk fest going on here is a bit too much.    Ben is a turd and he has cost a true ball player that actually cares about the game, a championship: Joel Embiid."
"It’s not a “weird narrative” this is what that poster above is referencing when saying AD is disrespected. Jokic and Embiid definitely had better seasons, but the problem with this sub and NBA fans in general is they have short memories and fail to properly contextual abnormal performances.   AD won a ring less than a year ago (no, not as a sidekick)  and doesn’t get relentlessly attacked at the rim or on the perimeter like the MVP does every post-season. He’s objectively been better than Joel in the playoffs too (better numbers, more efficient with and without LeBron)."
"Joel Embiid played through a torn knee in the finals recently, from all accounts it hurt like a motherf@#ker! No complaints from the big man.... 'cept for a missed open dunk."
"If Rivers came out after Game 7 and said, “I don’t know if Joel can be a late game player for a championship team”, after Embiid came up short down the stretch for the 3rd time that series, he would have been out of the job by the next day."
"Eh, I think we just have to agree to disagree because we're seeing the same issue but coming to different conclusions.  I agree, Embiid's prime is the biggest concern. Which to me is why you don't rush into a bad trade just to dump Simmons. He's still our strongest trade asset and you absolutely wait for the best possible piece to help Joel win a title. Trading Simmons for peanuts because he's throwing a tantrum only makes us lose our best asset and ensures Embiid never wins a title."
"He didn’t publicly diss him though. A reporter asked what the turning point was, then Joel mentioned a string of 3-4 possessions that started with Ben not dunking. It went from a 50-50 game to Atlanta being in control after those plays. He didn’t mention Ben at all.  &gt;I don’t know how to say it, but thought the turning point was just you know we had an open shot, we made one free throw and missed the other. You know they came down and scored and we didn’t get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he hit a three. And down 4 I go, it’s on me, I turn the ball over trying to make something happen.  I just rewatched the video and here’s a like 90% accurate transcript. Even when Embiid is “throwing Ben under the bus” he’s not even mentioning him by name and he’s highlighting his mistakes as well. Ben not dunking was literally the turning point of the game. Players should be able to describe a play that happened without their teammate taking it personal."
"Ewing overlapped his career with the following centers:  Kareem,  Hakeem, Robert Parish, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Dikembe Mutumbo, Alonzo Mourning, Sabonis I, Brad Dougherty, Rik Smits.  In that murderers row of centers, voters looked up and down the league and said ""Yeah, Ewing is a top 3 center this year.""  Dwight Howard overlapped with:  Shaquille O'Neal, Ben Wallace, Yao Ming, Amar'e Stoudemire, Al Jefferson, Kevin Garnett (look, by this stage of his career KG was a center), Al Horford, Joel Embiid.  Dwight's list isn't terrible, and hes a great player, but its not close to Ewing's list."
"I agree with him, that those 4 would probably fair the best, but there are quite a few players who I think would've been much better in previous eras than they are today.  Omitting: TD, Dirk, Kobe, and LBJ, because they all have played very close to that era, and played with alot of guys who were still around from the 90s.  Previous comments mentioned KD, who would be deadly in any era.    (Active) Superstars: Most of them would be those created players that people make the NBA video games.  They'd change alot of the rules to go against these guys, because to be honest it would make things a little unfair. Most of them can shoot 3s (probably better than most 3 point specialist from that time period), pretty well, yet they can do all sorts of things on the court. It would be unfair.   People say physicality would kill alot of these players, but I don't think so easily. If they are at their modern day levels, they'd be taking alot of advantages with them.  They'd be bigger than most people at their positions, as well as being somewhat faster. They'd be able to use all of those tools to their advantage against smaller players. Remember, they are taking the 3 point shooting with them, as well as the athleticism.  These arguments are so vague, because  they almost make no sense.   1. Steph Curry would be pretty nasty in the 90s. People often speak about Reggie and Abdul-Rauf who could play, very well in this current era. Change record books on their own.   Steph has superior handles to both, and is better playmaker.  He can score alot of points, without ever coming into the paint, very much.  2. James Harden -- Is thick with handles, and he can draws fouls. He'd bait alot of aggressive defenders into easy foul calls.  He can shoot 3s, as well.   3. As much as people dislike him, Russell Westbrook, his aggressiveness and toughness would take him along away, and don't let him get on a bad team. He'd really boost his abilities up.   4A. Zion, he'd be greater in the earlier eras.  4B. CP3, pretty obvious.    5. Joel Embiid, he could play his game, a little bit more, though he would bring the good outside/3 point shooting with him, which would catch alot of teams, and opposing centers off guard.  They wouldn't able to hang out in the paint on defense.  People keep forgetting aspect, because it would take most centers (even the great ones) out of their element.   6. Luka Doncic: His talent crosses eras, like everyone above.  7. Nikola Jokic: Just like Embiid, he take guys out of their element, similarly to younger Sabonis.  Most centers probably would not be equip to guard a center who can pass, like a guard and shoot like 3 point specialist. Also, he can score from any given point on offense.   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo -- He'd be sickening in previous decades. There's almost no one who is comparable to him, outside of Olajuwon and Garnett. But, the kicker is that Giannis might be a bit more faster and agile than both, while also being a bit more stronger. He also handles the ball, like a guard.   9. As unpopular as he is right now, Ben Simmons. His height, point guard skills, and defensive abilities, alone would make him highly coveted. He'd fit in alot of times, especially if they have other guys who can score.  Also, I feel like more coaches would just make him post up, more, especially against smaller defenders.  In some of these previous eras, he could get away with not shooting or scoring, too much. Coaches would want him to take more of those easy opportunities.  The thing is with Embiid, Jokic, and even Giannis, they are very efficient and diverse scorers/playmakers, as the two centers are pretty above average shooters for any type of players.  10. Dame -- Pretty obvious.  11. Jimmy Butler -- He's pretty intense. So, he'd fit in pretty good.   12. AD -- Talented across the board, like Embiid and Jokic. He's also a good defender, like Embiid.   13. Kyrie Irving -- He wouldn't drop off, very much, if it at all. Still an all-star.   14. Bradley Beal -- Still pretty good.  15. Zach Lavine - He'd be a pretty good player in the 90s, like he is now. People sleep on him, sometimes.   16. Devin Booker: Definitely  17. D'Angelo Russell: His game would be more competitive in that era.   18. Brandon Ingram: He falls into that KD, Giannis, and Ben Simmons category.  19. Jayson Tatum/Jaylen Brown: Not much of drop off, or a change. They'd be about the same, but slightly better.   20. Donovan Mitchell: Not much of a drop-off, or change.   21. DeAaron Fox: About the same.  22. Bam Adebayo: He fit perfectly into previous eras.   22. Draymond Green: I know people think he'd fold up, like a chair in previous eras. But, he's an elite defender in any era. He'd be compared to Rodman, alot. Which is not a good comparison, outside of the dirty play. Because, Draymond is a pretty good playmaker, and can also guard all five positions in switches and in one-on-one situations.  Green and Rodman are very close to each other on defense, almost splitting hairs. I feel like Rodman guarded bigs better, though I feel Draymond is more equipped to handle smaller, shiftier wings.   23. Trae Young: Similar to several smaller point guards in the 90s, against the main question of physicality. He is a smaller point guard, though he is pretty elite tough shot maker. He's pretty speedy and has great handles, as well.  24. Ja Morant: About the same.     I'm not quite sure: Karl Anthony Towns: He's very talented offensively, very unique. Could he still be in top 5 or 6, I'm not quite sure.   Jamal Murray:  Older players:  Derrick Rose: Pretty comparable to many wing scorers from the 90s. DeMarcus Cousins: Definitely Kevin Love: He has unique set of skills. DeMar Derozan: He has great scoring ability.  John Wall  Jabari Parker/Andrew Wiggins: They both would have the green-light to shoot and score, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, where ball movement was pretty low across the league.   Guys you wouldn't think, but would be much more relied upon:  Julius Randle Nikola Vučević Enes Kanter Derrick Favors Jalil Okafor   Sidenote: If I missed some players, it was not in intentional.  It's quite few guys to list."
Agreed but we want to maximise our opportunity to win with Joel. There’s better options out there for Simmons that help the team more in the next 2-3 years while Embiid is still hopefully fit and firing
"&gt;Anyone from Africa is apparently immediately lying about their age.   “Anyone”  You realize Africa has more than two players in the NBA, right? People don’t say Joel Embiid is lying about his age."
"&gt;he is very good at getting to the rim and finishing  The problem is that it's the only place he can finish, and he doesn't have a lot of diversity to his finishing  &gt;when embiid and tobias aren’t taking up that space  That's the point. Embiid and Tobias are better scorers and can create in a range of ways, but because Simmons can only score in a single way they have to do something different. He forces them, and the offence, away from what they are good at and a lot of efficient scoring   &gt;if you replaced tobias for cj i think it would benefit ben and joel  That's true to a degree. Simmons would have the ball even less in the halfcourt, and CJ creates more of his shots from the perimeter than Tobias. But Ben and Joel are still an awful fit. In the halfcourt Simmons is basically an unskilled 5 with passing ability, Joel is an incredibly talented 5. Simmons makes it easier to double Joel, while providing very little  &gt;the fit for those 3 is awkward and that’s my problem  There's 1 player making that fit awkward, the player that's only effective if he's standing in front of the rim. Embiid is one of the best players in the world, you do everything you can to put him in a position to generate effective offence. Tobias is a versatile shooting forward, he's not talented enough to be a reason to define the shape of your team, but he's not that difficult to fit around. Replace Simmons with CJ and the fit also gets a lot better"
yeah he’s not a post scorer but he did have some moves that worked. he is very good at getting to the rim and finishing....when embiid and tobias aren’t taking up that space. ben’s scoring was fine before this season. doc gave tobias more offensive freedom and it resulted in less ben shots. the fit for those 3 is awkward and that’s my problem. if you replaced tobias for cj i think it would benefit ben and joel. fun fact: giannis shot more 3s than tobias did last season.
"&gt;in the halfcourt ben attacks mismatches and had some post opportunities  He's pretty bad at both of these things  &gt;in the playoffs, ben doesn’t score in the halfcourt really. offense goes through joel in the post. ben does some of the big man things like setting screens and rolling.  This is the problem. He tries rolling into space and cutting while Embiid should be occupying that space  He occupies the most valuable space on the floor, makes it harder for others to score, and offers very little on offence while also being vulnerable to purposeful fouls"
"That’s fair, and I agree once Joel starts playing his heart out he could win over any fan base. But the original comment was “who says no” and my imagination immediately pictured our subreddit being informed the wolves were considering a package for Embiid centered around KAT. It would be on the level of the Jimmy drama."
I’m sure you are but it’s like me being at a knicks game and talking shit to a hawks fan a few seats down.. it’s just part of the game I’m not gonna meet that same fan at a park one day and think I wanna fight that guy. Joel embiid is joel embiid he’s not the physical embodiment of a 76er
Lmao it’s all good! I don’t hate Joel Embiid but our sub is at its most toxic during and directly after the 76ers games. It’s fun to watch the drama but that trade would be like detonating a nuclear bomb for a lot of wolves fans. The salt would overflow.
"I’m not even talking about my valuation of the trade on the merits. Straight up Joel is public enemy #1 on the Twolves sub, I can’t think of any trade targets that would get a stronger negative reaction from our sub. Maybe Jeff Teague? Edit: actually Jimmy Butler would be worse. Idk why I didn’t think of that.  I had to go read through our last game thread just to make sure my memory was correct. If you wanna know the wolves fans sentiments towards Joel Embiid, sort this thread by “Best” and you’ll get an idea of why I think the wolves fanbase would not want that trade. The Joel hate on the sub is like the Simmons hate on r/nba rn lol. That’s just a game thread but the sub gets spammed all week shitting on Embiid.  https://np.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/mjkhsw/game_thread_minnesota_timberwolves_1237/  So when somebody says “who says no” the timberwolves fanbase as a whole definitely does."

"Ben Simmons Tried To Rob Me! This happened in June, but I’ve finally worked up the courage to talk about it. I was working the closing shift all alone at my job at Kay Jewelers when all of a sudden two GIANT men wearing ski masks ran into the store. The taller man got a bag out while his accomplice pulled out a GUN! They took off their masks and revealed their faces, to my absolute shock it was none other than Joel EmBooty and BUM Simmons! They were robbing the store for rings because they can’t win one on their own! Joel yelled at me, “Give us all the rings here or else my friend Ben is gonna shoot!” I immediately burst out laughing, everyone knows Ben Simmons can’t shoot 🤣 I was literally rolling on the floor for 10 minutes from laughing so hard meanwhile Ben Simmons stayed frozen 🥶 unable to pull the trigger. Embiid realized Ben wasn’t going to shoot and started to run away humiliated when he suddenly SLIPPED and injured himself again 🤕 He limped the rest of the way out of the store. Luckily our security guard Trae Young arrived on the scene and LOCKED 🔒 Simmons up! He walked right up to him to arrest him and Ben tried to pass the gun to one of his teammates 😂 Learn how to shoot you FRAUD 🤡"
Yes the extra endurance would help important players play more minutes with more energy. Imagine if you could play Joel Embiid 48 minutes without him dying near the end of the game. That's probably an extreme exaggeration though.
"I don't know that Joel Embiid can be healthy enough to be a championship level Center either.  He's still here.  Whatever happened to proving people wrong and working your ass off to prove it... That's the shit he's lacking, a pair of stones to go out there and silence the doubters."
"LMAO you honestly think if Joel Embiid goes a couple months averaging 10ppg with no other improvement, that teams will still regard him as Top 5 in the league?  Sixers fan are funny. On one hand yall can't stop ranting about how bad Ben Simmons is and how yall meme him even in your own sub. On the other hand, yall want a good trade value for Simmons.  Nobody needs an all star who can't perform in the playoffs. There's a reason Minny seems to be the only team interested at the moment. If Ben Simmons is who you're saying, teams will be lining up with trade offers for him.  But hey, be delusional all you want, but it takes 2 teams to have a trade. At your organization's asking price, good luck with that.  Or keep him. As I've said above, just sort it out internally with Ben and keep him for now. If you feel like nobody's giving you a good deal, then don't trade. Nobody's forcing you to accept anything."
"Dude is all hot air. That whole team, including Joel Embiid, have changed what they do to fit with Simmons and in return Simmons offers empty promises and bullshit shooting videos with his under qualified trainers.  Embiid is an elite player. The team should be built around him and that will not happen as long as Simmons is clogging the lane."
"Try again.  If instead of Ben, Joel Embiid is the one demanding a trade, watch how people would react entirely differently. I'm sure Portand would be fine with trading Dame for Embiid, sentimental reasons aside. Most players in the league would be a reasonable fair trade for Embiid. People here aren't all unreasonable.  Yall can't crucify Ben the whole summer and expect teams to be excited about trading for him. Sixers fan were telling anybody who would listen about how Ben has an attitude problem and was afraid to fail, and then turn around and ask for a good trade package lol.  Imo yall should keep him. Make peace with him internally. Let him show people that dpoy candidate again in the regular season. Then his trade value could be higher. Right now what you see is what you get."
"It was good defence once Embiid had the ball, but it was already over that point  If you're sealed behind Joel Embiid catching the ball with two feet in the paint, then you've already lost the possession"
"Joel Embiid. I used to think he was a cocky asshole until I watched Trae Young drag his fat fucking nuts across the Knicks faces. Then I was like ""hey this trash talk and taunting thing is actually pretty entertaining""."
"That essentially would've gutted the bench of any potential youthful talent which, maybe you didn't watch the Sixers playoffs this year, has underperformed greatly. Shake Milton had one good game, Maxey had a few nice offensive plays but as a rookie couldn't defend. Picking up Danny and Seth helped but one got injured and the other was a turnstile. Outside of Ben and Joel, Thybulle's the only one with any real defensive talent.  We have a generational talent in Embiid, but as the Nets proved this season, two great players might not be enough to carry a team to the end."
Robert Covington? Jerami Grant? Joel Embiid? Lol
"Yeah, people acting like AD is the most injury prone star in the league are not being realistic. Look at AD compared to these other top 10 players with how many regular season games they've all missed over the last 5 seasons.  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old"
"I support this one. I think a lot of people forget where the momentum in the East was around that time. The Bucks had lost only once in that playoffs up until the conference finals. Most everyone thought at the time that whoever came out of Philly-Toronto was going to get beat by the Bucks. Giannis was the MVP, they were the 1 seed, and they were arguably a better team than this past season's championship team. The Sixers and Raps both had their flaws at the time.   I don't think Joel Embiid is the common denominator though. That would be the guy who is currently sitting out"
"Yes, in the way of it didn’t yield a championship team, but no, in that it still got Embiid, and the goal of The Process was to obtain a true superstar through the draft. The Process still resulted in a team with Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Tobias Harris, and then management fucked that up."
"It was three seasons ago. And it was a fluke. And they were still nowhere near winning a title.  Portland is the worst defensive team in the league that has any kind of title aspirations.  I guess if you're content with them having no chance because they have no D, cool. They'd clearly be better with Simmons than with CJ. How many Sixers games did you watch last year?  And, yes, Embiid and Simmons definitely aren't going to win a title. What does that have to do with anything? Is your position that Dame and Joel are the exact same player and the rest of the rosters are built the same? Odd."
"Ok controversial takes:  I didn’t think this was too controversial, but looking at this sub I guess it is. Luke will be the face of the NBA after LeBron. Everyone brings up the fact that he hasn’t won a playoff series, but if you watch those games knowing that: the kid is only 3 years into the NBA, carrying a trash team, and playing against two elite defenders that should absolutely shut him down. He’s got loads of potential  The Magic have the best color pallet and name in the NBA, and the most potential for branding (it’s literally magic. They could make some wild jerseys). Some cosmic-themed jerseys could be sick if done right  Russell Westbrook (one of my favorite players) was never a natural scorer. His scoring was because of his aggression and imposing himself, his shot selection was often iffy and his averages weren’t great.   The Sixers brought all this drama on themselves. Teams should embrace their teammates/staff. Not automatically throw them under the bus, bringing hate from all over the league onto Ben. He was absolutely the reason the Sixers lost, but they should’ve stood with him to resolve it. The Mavs absolutely lost because of Porzingis, but they stood by him and they are still on (I assume) good terms coming into the new season.  Joel Embiid holds back, and he could be much better than he is. Knowing that he’s got bones of glass and skin of paper, he plays reserved hoping not to get injured (even though he still does). If he were healthier he’d be this generations Shaq  Hate for the bandwagon fans is bad for the NBA fandom. Box office teams like Kobe/Shaq, MJ, Kareem/Magic, LeBron/Kyrie, Curry, etc. attract fans who are curious what the hype is about. It brings in new people who don’t know much about the NBA teams, so they form an attachment to their first team (big-name team) which is then criticized by old fans  Anthony Davis is a beast, but he’s not a good first-option player   Seattle shouldn’t get an NBA team if the NBA expands. They had a chance and lost it, dozens of other cities would kill to have had an NBA team. Give a chance to other cities  Sort of building off that last one. No city should have 2 teams. The second teams should relocate somewhere to provide more fans with a “home team”. The Knicks are New York’s team, the Lakers are LA’s team. Give the Nets and the Clipper’s to cities that have wanted an NBA team  Draft expectations can ruin a players perspective. Most players coming into the NBA are still just college age kids, they need a few years to develop into role players or possibly stars. But labeling them a star from day one stunts them into being widely labeled a bust if they don’t live up to those monstrous expectations"
"would have to be a star center for the Hornets just to make us a playoff force... especially needs to be able to carry a team defensively. One of these guys might get us in the mix but not favorites... Alonzo Mourning? Dwight Howard? Joel Embiid?   Short of prime Shaq,  nobody is getting us past Brooklyn."
Find a player you like and follow them. As you see other players you will begin to find others you like maybe even more.  As for me I am a 76ers fan and I absolutely love Joel Embiid
"&gt; What happens when Embiid demands a trade so he can actually spend his prime competing with a roster that actually uses its cap space? What happens when Embiid gets injured and you miss your window?  Yes, Joel Embiid who just signed an extension this summer is definitely at risk of requesting a trade soon!"
"The Sixers were never once contenders with Joel Embiid. Not in 2019, not this past season. The 2019 team is one of the most overrated teams of the last 20 years. They couldn’t been beat a Raptors team that was shooting like 29% on open threes. It doesn’t get much worse than that and they *still* couldn’t win. Doesn’t stop idiots from regularly saying shit like “hurr durr, one bounce away from the championship”"
"I feel like the 6ers should still be pretty good without Simmons lol. I doubt Joel Embiid is thinking that the organization is wasting his prime when he's on the court. Probably thinkin bout dominating on offense and defense, like he did last year.  Theyll need some guys to step up but I dont think this is the same 6ers who were swept by Boston w/o Simmons"
"&gt;I love Sixers fans always saying ""Teams get injured and get desperate"" not realizing their teams star is Joel Embiid and the Sixers could ALSO get desperate, and their star is in a situation where he can get injured more than 99% of other stars, and most teams are pretty content as of now.  If Embiid gets hurt you trade Simmons for picks &amp; load up for next year.... there's really minimal reasons to force a trade now.  Idk why no one here can see that..."
"It's obviously true, like didn't they say last draft had 10 people with Nigerian origin? That's absurd considering the percentage of the US population.  Basically a Joel Embiid type is not gonna come out of China, but there's no reason even someone as good as Enes Kanter isn't out there."
"76ers players claiming Tobias Harris is the leader over Joel Embiid, is the 76ers franchise imploding?"
"Do you seriously believe that? It has literally never been more clear that the City is committed to Joel. They gave him the largest contract anyone has ever been given as a sixer this summer. The guy is set to be a Philly legend for life regardless of whether he wins a championship.   &amp;#x200B;  I would be SHOCKED if Embiid and Daryll are not on the same page regarding this situation. Embiid is probably content to roll out the squad we have now and compete for the first few months of the season. See if any injuries/underperforming teams effect the trade landscape. If not, Brogdan and a 1st will still be available whenver Joel says 'its time'"
"I don't think anyone in the Sixers fanbase, front office, coaching staff, or roster expects this team to compete for a championship without either Ben coming back to play or a Star being part of a trade coming to Philly.   &amp;#x200B;  If anything this is a bridge year, similar to what you guys are going through waiting for Murray to be back. It's going to be fun to watch Joel become more of a leader and see how Maxey looks shooting 15-20 times a night.  &amp;#x200B;   If the team still looks like a top seed in the east around the deadline without Simmons, then I would absolutely consider trading simmons for a package of quality role plays + picks. But the more likely scenario is that Embiid carries the squad to a 6-8 seed and earns MVP consideration (similar to Jokic last year). Either way its going to be more fun to watch than starting the season taking some shit undervalued offer of role players and have to just deal with it.   &amp;#x200B;  Im a sixers fan and i'm genuinely looking forward to this season. I expect Joe and MAxey especially to break out. Shake will likeyl be moved this year."
Tobias Harris is more respected in the Sixers locker room than Joel Embiid.  -ESPN
Because China rolls out Zhou Qi as their best big who didn’t make it in the nba and Joel Embiid is one of the most dominant bigs in the nba. I’ll take my chances with him
"You have to realize Joel Embiid is looking over and seeing nobody there, should he waste his prime while management plays with Ben Simmons?"
"Since this isn;t the Sixers sub where all of this has been discussed endlessly here, a couple points to throw out to let you know where I am coming from here:   1.  Joel Embiid is a MUCH better OFFENSIVE player with Ben Simmons on the court vs without him.  More efficient, better shooting percentages, better advanced stats.   2.  Sixers starting lineup with Ben Simmons is +15.9, and was statistiaclly top 3 in the league amongst starting lineups OFFENSIVELY.  Without Ben Simmons on the floor, the Sixers had one of the worst Offensive ratings   3.  The Sixers have no financial flexibility.  Approx 24 million over cap so no signings of deep meaning will happen, Tobias Harris is an above average player but is a negative trade asset and is under contract for years.  This contract is a huge limiting factor, so one of our 3 max guys would cost us more to move him.   4.  Ben Simmons is the only playmaker / primary ball handler on the roster.  Even if Ben was playing, about 10-15 minutes a game a 30% shooter in Maxey (who is more of a 2 guard then playmaker anyways) or Shake Milton would be the backup and would again cause our offense to tank without Simmons, and in 2021-2022 we now have 48 minutes a game of no PG to look forward to at this point.   5.  Biggest need for the team was a shot creator to play alongside Ben.  If Ben is traded, our biggest need becomes a primary ball handler.  Spacing around Joel is not the biggest need (see the Sixers offensively with an on shooter in Simmons).  Perfect world we trade Tobias for a guy like CJ Mccollum and Ben suits up.  That would provide a bigger then 0% chance to advance and improve upon our squad from last year.  Unfortunately this ship has sailed and has no shot of happening, Ben is never going to see the court for us again.   6.  To address your comment about Embiid...If Ben Simmons is traded for peanuts, then yes Morey will trade Embiid in the next few years, and will trade Danny Green, Seth Curry, and other role players this year most likely.  It is definitely rebuild time.  Luckily for us Ben Simmons is under contract for 4 years, so there is no panic."
“Writing this year off” with prime Joel Embiid. A man that hasn’t been known to be competitive at all. I bet he will be thrilled with your patience.
"&gt; Joel is one bad injury away from his career ending.   I don’t disagree with thus but I don’t see how it is relates to Simmons or the Sixers success plan.   There is no viable outcome where the Sixers succeed without Embiid, similar to any other team with a superstar.  Like what is the path to success for the Bucks if Giannis has a season ending injury or the Lakers if LeBron goes down?   You can argue the Nets but they are such an anomaly and the conversation isn’t about the Nets."
"I love Sixers fans always saying ""Teams get injured and get desperate"" not realizing their teams star is Joel Embiid and the Sixers could ALSO get desperate, and their star is in a situation where he can get injured more than 99% of other stars, and most teams are pretty content as of now."
"You can't even call this hindsight. It's not like he's a breakout player. Kyle Lowry is a known quantity. He's a floor general, tone setter, fuckin dog after a bone, known winner, and he would've laid it all out on the court for his hometown. Morey is a moron because that's exactly who Joel Embiid needed next to him, not whatever Ben Simmons is."
"&gt;  However, we saw what Giannis did to frontcourts a few months ago during the postseason.  I'm not saying Shaq wouldn't still be dominant, but also, Giannis moves a lot better than non-Orlando Shaq.  &gt;  I'd argue the physicality he brings would wreak havoc on this era during the postseason where the refs let these players bang.  For sure, he'd be fouling players out just like he used to.  He changed the league.  But he would also get run off the court on defense a lot, unless he kept his weight down.  If Joel Embiid can score efficiently on the post up, so can Shaq, more so.  Just commenting that stretching the floor out, better pick and rolls and motion offenses definitely make it harder on him.  He's still capable of being #1 option on a chip level team with the right help, imo.  A couple really good snipers would really benefit from Shaq's gravity."
I mean using fiba rankings to compare African countries vs China isn’t really honest. If Joel Embiid and Siakim played for their international team they would be ahead of China easily. Same with Ibaka and Kuminga.  The fact that China has over 1 billion people and a decent sized domestic league and not one nba player is pretty bad.
"KU could put up something like:  PG - Devonte' Graham  SG - Ben McLemore  SF/PF - Morris Twins (maybe not ideal, but come on)  C - Joel Embiid"
I heard Joel Embiid said this too
"Joel Embiid. Please allow me to explain. I don't mean people should be scrutinising him for his character but I feel like hes been let off the hook for his playoff failures.  So, to me, Joel Embiid has underachieved in 3 of the last 4 playoffs hes played in starting from 2018. Rewind your memory and youll remember its the 2nd round with the Boston celtics vs the 76ers. The 76ers were undoubtedly the favourites in that series, it was Embiid, Simmons, Saric, Reddick, Ilyasova, Bellinelli going up against rookie Tatum, Sophomore Brown, Rozier,Smart and Horford. Not only did they lose, they lost in 5 games. Im willing to half let this slide since it was his first playoff appearance.  2019 was his worst by far. The 76ers had by far one of the most stacked rosters in the league with Embiid, Butler, Simmons, Harris and Reddick i mean cmon. They were definetely supposed to beat Toronto. After averaging 27.5 ppg and 14 rpg on 48% fg in the regular season his stats plummetted to a meagrr 17.5ppg and 9 rpg on 37% fg. Simply indefensible  2021. Now one of the main reasons why Embiid was left off the hook in this playoffs was because Simmons' ineptitude sorta overshadowed it all. But i need to reiterate how bad of a team they lost to for those who forgot. They were facing a 5th seeded, LITERAL playoff virgin team as the 1 seed. Trae young, collins, huerter, bogdanovic, gallinari i mean are you kidding me you lost to this team. If anyone dare says they expected the hawks to beat them they are fucked up. You have Harris, Simmon, Curry, Green, Thybulle, Howard and you cant beat this 5th seeded ppayoff virgin 22 yr olds. Its ridiculous. They blew a 18 pt 4th quarter in game 5 where embiid went 1-5 and in the 4th quarter of game 7 he didnt score in the last 4 minutes when it was tied and couldnt get it done. Ik every 6er fan is dissappointed in him."
"&gt; ""This is not a rivalry,"" Embiid said following the Sixers' 105-87 loss to the Celtics on Tuesday night, per Sporting News' Sean Deveney. ""I don't know our record against them, but it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2801298-joel-embiid-on-celtics-its-not-a-rivalry-they-always-kick-our-ass"
"Im not saying he is a better post player or at Hakeem Kareem or Duncans level, but he is pretty damn elite in the post too, his efficiency in the post is pretty close to Joel Embiid."
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"Miles Turner does not have a similar skillset as Joel Embiid. Turner shoots 4x as many 3's per game and never takes any midrangers, Joel works all the way from the basket out. Turner's defense relies more on block hunting. Turner would be a way better fit with Ben."
"I mean I agree in principle but I definitely disagree with  &gt; We ... have just absolutely failed to surround him with players that space the floor.  The Sixers have managed to surround Ben and Joel with good shooters every year except for the 2019-20 disastrous team. Last year in particular the roster was packed with good shooters, which we hadn't really had since Ben's rookie season with JJ/Cov/Dario/Belinelli/Ilyasova. The real issue with the roster construction is that nobody can do anything off the dribble. Ben is a savant at finding open men but we've only ever had Embiid as the guy who puts pressure on opposing defenses. I mean how many times does the team end up aimlessly swinging the ball around or with Ben handing off to a shooter who's tightly covered?  Good shooters can only do so much to get open. The roster has always needed some kind of perimeter oriented scorer to put pressure on the defense to get our 3&amp;D. Fultz was supposed to be that guy. Jimmy was that guy for a short period. JJ almost looked like that guy (if you squint) and he looked like a god in Philly because of it. Just adding another knockdown shooter won't really help, the team really needs a three-level scorer to unlock everything else.  Also I'm not sure where you're seeing the Danny Green numbers? I see him as [18th in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_totals.html#totals_stats::fg3) last season. Looks like he's pretty firmly in the tier of ""dudes who shoot a lot""."
So you’d bring Ben Simmons to Indiana then you’d trade Sabonis so that you could pair Simmons with a center that has a similar skillset as Joel Embiid? Got it.
I'm betting $100 right now that Jokic will never score 41+ in 1 game against Joel Embiid. In his career. https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jokic-career-high-vs-sixers
"kyrie: for sure.  for years now.  kd: he's had a few bad seasons for injuries in his long career, remains to be seen if it will be a new normal after the achilles  harden: who knows because aging but normally you'd say last year was a fluke.  the only other seasons where he played less than 72 games were either lockout-shortened or covid-shortened.  embiid has played less than 50% of all possible games since he got drafted.  and he _didn't_ play more games than kyrie last year, kyrie played 54 and joel played 51.  and kyrie's missed games weren't all due to injury.... &gt;.&gt;"
"I can't find any evidence that shows this is true. RS state this in their article but there is no corroborating evidence, not even a screenshot of his like to the post. If we have learnt anything from the whole Simmons saga is that we shouldn't believe everything the media throws at us (semi quoting Joel Embiid here)....in fact, we should be very sceptical of everything they throw at us. Especially stuff like you are suggesting, that should automatically come with a very large degree of scepticism from the reader...."
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
"Yeah, who would want their young players to learn from a Hall of Famer and one of the greatest players in your franchise history who they apparently aren't capable of contacting for themselves if you don't give him a job.  I'm sure Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid have never had long conversations with AI."
Another one I thought of:  Lonzo Ball  CJ McCollum   Andrew Wiggins   Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid
"They already withheld $8m in salary, fines are being deducted from that withheld money.   If he shows up next week, they owe him whatever is left of that $8m and have to keep paying him - even if he just sucks on purpose or gets ""injured"".   If he sits a whole year and loses his service year, Philly still has to pay him for the next four seasons whenever he comes back. No matter how bad he is.   I fail to see how the 76ers have any real leverage here. Fining him doesn't recoup cap space or put winning players around Embiid. Do we think that Joel Embiid will patiently wait it out and waste his whole age 27 season, or if it goes on longer than this year, risk his age 28 season? Do the 76ers want to waste these two prime years of their superstar?   I don't think Simmons is as helpless as it appears. The 76ers can't afford to wait this out forever. They have a 2-3 year window to maximize the team around Embiid and this is gonna shorten that window."
"Trade him and get Joel Embiid some help, two maybe even three new players and let them have time to get accumulated. This is so stupid, and honestly petty. Trade him and move on, the precedent has already been set"
"No way. Jaylen would be a perfect complement to Embiid. He can get his but is willing to let a teammate dominate the ball. And he's great at catch-and-shoot 3s, providing spacing.  The 6ers defense would take a hit, but you'd still be anchored by Joel. And the offense would be great."
"I don’t buy this excuse. Tim Duncan joined an MVP caliber center in David Robinson (a Joel Embiid equivalent in this comparison) and was able to develop himself into having a nice career.  If Duncan can do it, why can’t Simmons? Unless the answer is that Simmons is much softer than Duncan?"
"""God damn you ~~Carol Baskin~~  Ben Simmons!""   \- ~~Joe Exotic~~   \- Joel ""Exotic"" Embiid"
"“Hello, Police. Joel Embiid is trying to beat me up”"
"The crazy thing is that he did say that:  ""I ain't shoot well from the line this series,"" Simmons said following the Sixers' 103-96 Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. ""Offensively, I wasn't there. I didn't do enough for my teammates. ... There's a lot of things that I need to work on.""  Yet people have entirely forgotten this quote because of the drama that followed  https://6abc.com/sixers-hawks-game-7-nba-playoffs-ben-simmons-joel-embiid/10815769/"
Against Rudy gobert so many centers have had good games against him. Hell even Ben Simmons  Ben Simmons: 42/9/12 on 57.7% FG  Nikola Jokic: 47/12/5 on 65.4 FG  Joel Embiid: 40/19/3 on 51.9% FG  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 35/8/4 on 56.0 FG
"Ya, Tobi and Embiid need a top level facilitator and that is definitely what Kyrie is.  A Kyrie, Thybulle, Green, Tobi, Joel front court with Seth as the sixth man and Maxey, Furkan, Georges, and Drummond off the bench could be top tier. Not better than the nets by a long shot, but potienally better than the bucks."
"I don’t think it’s about being fragile. He’s decided he can’t thrive on a team with Joel Embiid, a conclusion a lot of basketball pundits agree with. It’s not that he disrespects Embiid. It’s because they both are at their best playing in the paint and in today’s game there’s not room for two such players on the same team."
joel embiid is not the reason we lost that series and you know it
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
"The MVP race from the same survey:  1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn – 37%  2. Luka Doncic, Dallas – 33%  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 13%  4. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia – 7%  5. James Harden, Brooklyn – 7%  6. Stephen Curry, Golden State – 3%"
"Jokic is ranked higher than Embiid, yet the MVP race is:  1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn – 37%  2. Luka Doncic, Dallas – 33%  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 13%  4. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia – 7%  5. James Harden, Brooklyn – 7%  6. Stephen Curry, Golden State – 3%"
"So people really think he deserves Joel Embiid money? 25% of your cap money? I'd have to think about it, tbh."
Best career because he is playing next to Joel Embiid. Simmons is 4th from his draft
"&gt;Which rookie will be the best player in five years?   &gt;   &gt;Ben Simmons, Philadelphia – 70.0%    Kris Dunn, Minnesota – 20.0%   Brandon Ingram, L.A. Lakers – 6.7%   Joel Embiid, Philadelphia – 3.3%  Aged like milk"
D Book is my fav player ofc I watch them. He shoots midrange J’s sometimes but why we acting like this guy’s Joel Embiid
"Should be fine with like 7  1 - doesn't play, G League caliber player  2 - end of bench role player (like 10th man)  3 - solid bench role player  4 - starter caliber player (not necessarily a starter, and every starter isn't necessarily here)  5 - good to great starter  6 - all star caliber   7 - superstar  Maybe could even get down to 6 if you consolidate 1 and 2. Don't see a need to meaningfully separate, say, Joel Embiid from Donovan Mitchell, they're both all stars. Sure Embiid is the best big in the league but who cares lol"
"Redick tied it at 85 with a three-point play with 3:29 left. Nearly two minutes passed before the next basket, Leonard's long jumper with 1:41 to go that was initially ruled a 3, but changed to a 2 after video review.  On Philadelphia's next possession, Kyle Lowry forced a steal near midcourt and fed Siakam for a fast-break layup, giving Toronto an 89-85 lead with 1:14 left.  Butler made one of two at the line and Leonard missed a pair of jump shots, giving the 76ers the ball down 89-86 with 24.1 seconds remaining. Embiid was fouled and made both, cutting it to 89-88 with 12 seconds left.  Leonard was fouled with 10.8 seconds left. He made the first, but missed the second, setting up Butler's tying layup.  ""We did a lot of things that we could have done better but we found a way to win the game,"" Lowry said. ""That's all that matters.""   ESPN recap  Joel Embiid was in for all of that fyi  When I say that the Raps had all the momentum going into OT I wasn't theorizing, that's just tact the defense suffocated the Sixers who were feeling the moment"
"Because sometimes a team will have someone like joel embiid, which would make driving into the lane way more difficult than driving into blake griffin"
"here we go again mate, you're blinded by your hatred and that's fine. fact is simmons can win, without embiid, he plays well without embiid. they both play well together. and embiid plays well without ben. they're both awesome players. ben has said he thinks he's better without joel, people are clowning him for that, but he has proven it, individually. and +/- cherrypick all you want, simmons has playoff wins without jojo and jojo has none without ben. they both have playoff losses together. jojo is a liability in the 4th- his turnovers and missed shots, and inability to pass out of trouble, are and always will be big issues, that will hopefully be solved by a pointguard who isn't simmons.  but the biggest one, by far, is that he is injured for 20+ games a season and is yet to be healthy for a playoffs run. so rip on simmons all you want, but he isn't the only prbblem, and he's not the only star we have who can't win shit in the playoffs."
"My point is that you act like the Raptors were running away with the game, but in reality when Joel was on the court the Sixers had a fighting chance. Had they had a competent back up center they would’ve won the game period.   No shit Embiid couldn’t play all 48 mins lmao i don’t know what your point is with that.  Even with injury problems and sickness he was still one of the most impactful players on the court. Not that hard to understand buddy lol."
Joel “I can play PF” Embiid
"Ben Off Joel ON Horford Off +14.88  Also those Horford/Ben numbers are against the backups and backup centers because.... you guessed it, teams base their defense around Embiid. No Embiid and those numbers take a major dump."
"Embiid is better than them, he is not a better version of them. Embiid shot 37% from 3 last year in 3 attempts, Vucevic shot 40% from 3 in 6.3 3PA and Love has traditionally played the stretch 5 role in Cleveland for a while.  Embiid isn't at his best when he is shooting three's or 16 footers and that's exactly the type of center that Ben needs. They can win alot of games together because Joel Embiid is one of the 10 best players in the sport and Ben Simmons is a freak defender, that doesn't mean that they are a great fit for each other."
But Joel was considered the best player in the draft. 76ers were lucky to get him because of his injury history. Why are you being obtuse referencing Dante Exum? Aaron Gordon went before him and he’d have been an excellent fit for Philly had they not taken Embiid.
"I don't think this is entirely fair, because it doesn't factor in the quality or fit of teammates or opponents they play with when the other is sitting. The substitution pattern can affect this. Embiid is notorious for missing games and getting tired easily within the game. If he is playing primarily with strong lineups and isn't playing many minutes in weak ones, someone is going to have to fill the gap. If you're a coach, you're going to look to your next best player to do that, which was Simmons. Simmons has consistently played many more minutes than Embiid in the referenced time frame, so had to soak up more minutes with lower quality players, possibly denting his +/-.   I guess I'm not trying to say that Simmons doesn't deserve criticism, I just think this one is missing context. I would just ask that you consider that it may be the case that Ben and Joel don't fit together, and that since Joel is clearly the better player, the roster and substitutions have been shaped to favor him over Ben."

"Very interesting that despite ben's playoff woes, joel + ben is at +14 while just joel is at +1.  Also, obviously this post is a valid criticism of ben, but notice that the sixers have a 119 defensive rating without embiid. I don't think you can really argue that Ben is the one making their defense without embiid terrible."
Andre Drummond is only 7 months older than Joel Embiid
"If they chose the best possible player with the best fit at every pick every year? Probably a lineup of  Ben Simmons  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid  With guys like Mikal Bridges, Dejountae Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Thomas Bryant, Robert Williams off the bench."
"Imagine knowing you have Joel Embiid and not accepting a trade for a guy like this, Daryl is infatuated."
"I remember not being mad at him, just disappointed at the prospect of people only remembering that possession because he absolutely carried us before everything in the clip OP posted: https://youtu.be/KOega8E2q58?t=146. If you're watching that link and think you're seeing an overly aggressive chucker- bear in mind everyone on both sides were gassed AF, Embiid in particular. This was before Joel had learned to protect the ball inside the paint from steals, so Lowry was having a field day on him.   &amp;nbsp;  Butler looked like the best player on the court for that 4th quarter (as he did many times for us that season) and he hit a he game tying layup that I thought people would make everyone forget all about the blunder OP posted. I guess it did, because that devastating Kawhi shot is seared into our brains instead"
Been a Joel Embiid fan since he got drafted

Embiid is an obvious choice IMO.   Anunoby for $2 seems like an absolute steal.   Then having to decide between either getting another $5 player and a $1, or taking a $4 and a $2, and IMO I'd rather take a guy like Mitchell and the step up in talent from $1 to $2, than have a $5 talent and have to somehow shoehorn someone like Danny Green into the lineup."

Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
Yeah…that’s callled a ceiling. Joel had injury concerns and his game took major leaps where as Ben’s didn’t. Again my point is that Ben was definitely considered as the primary piece or 1a/1b at points throughout his time here. You’re using recency bias to say Embiid was always the player he became over the last two years and there were no health concerns.
"This bit is from the part about ben simmons side pick and rolls:  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout."
"Here are some excerpts from the article where the author describes how Ben can be an effective halfcourt scorer (make sure to watch the including videos).   **Ben Simmons postup game:**  &gt; When thinking about untapped areas, I keep going back to that game from this February against the Utah Jazz, where Embiid was absent and Simmons went up against Defensive Player of the Year candidate Rudy Gobert. Ben ran the offense through the post, going against Gobert or others through backing them down. He’d take his size advantage and a cleared-out lane to his advantage. While we think so much about what Simmons’ lack of shooting does for Embiid’s spacing, we don’t spend nearly enough time talking about how Embiid’s presence takes away all of Ben’s post-up looks.  &gt; With that lane cleared, he could use his length to play one-on-one and his explosion showed. Great touch off the glass, good patience and use of pump fakes, and superb touch with both hands:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xUmbP75Jis  &gt; Size advantages create most of these opportunities, as well as the Jazz willingly playing him one-on-one. If Simmons gets enough volume in post-ups, we know he’ll hurt teams who do over-help and bring doubles: he’s far too good a passer in every other fashion for it not to translate. As for judging the sample of his time in Philadelphia, it’s so hard to look at the post-up numbers due to Embiid’s presence and both Brett Brown and Doc Rivers’ insistence on not exposing Simmons at the 5. If you do, as a scorer and passer out of the post, Simmons was just as efficient (0.99 PPP) as Giannis (0.99), Karl-Anthony Towns (0.966) and Jayson Tatum (0.959). That number should increase with more spacing.  **Ben Simmons pick and roll:**  &gt; As a pick-and-roll handler, Simmons’ violates one of my main tenets in initiating offense: he doesn’t shoot it. Teams can go under against him and clearly contain him from the lane, forcing him to either take the shot or not put enough pressure on the rim to force help defenders to collapse. Without helpers tagging the role and squeezing the lane, catch-and-shoot kickout avenues won’t develop.  &gt; Simmons encounters those issues on middle pick-and-rolls quite frequently, where driving around the screen would push him wide and ultimately away from the rim. On side ball screens, when his penetration around the screen generates a paint touch, he’s actually fairly effective. Part of the reason for that: teams cannot ice screens and go under at the same time. When they go under and try to meet him on the other side, Simmons is so damn lanky and long that one bounce and enough explosion allows him to get to the front of the tin.  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hb9C8kvGwQ  &gt; A great breakdown by Shehan here. Note that Embiid does a fantastic job screening his own man here so that Simmons only has one body to navigate and finish through.  &gt; Now imagine that play with one of the league’s premier pick-and-pop threats. Embiid can shoot (23-59 on pick-and-pop catch-and-shoot jumpers) but as we said earlier, he’s absolutely dominant on the blocks. Teams would rather live with the Embiid pop than anything he (or Simmons) get at the rim. Replace Joel in that action with a guy like Karl-Anthony Towns (24-59 but with a 60.2% aFG%, taking more treys) and perhaps the defense hugs KAT so much that Simmons gets to the rim, or even draws a help defender for a kickout.  **Ben Simmons in a free-flowing offense based on dribble handoffs:**  &gt; Clearing out one side of the floor just for Simmons to score in the lane isn’t an ideal usage of a team’s time. But there are great ways to flow into that action from a 5-out or delay series in the NBA. The quick swings and handoffs from the Indiana Pacers playbook last year are examples of how to get Simmons the ball on the move. Not only does that put him in the situation to play through the pick-and-roll but might catch some teams unable to go underneath screens:  &gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjMTEMUl5g  &gt; Here’s the catch: pair Simmons with the right team and he can be Domantas Sabonis in the clips above at times, too. A hybrid 5 who has the offensive game of a wing (think KAT, Christian Wood, Chris Boucher) to cut or space while Simmons trails to the middle of the floor would be incredibly dynamic, even if it’s only for brief moments. A small-ball Simmons at the 5 grouping might be the best way to unlock late-game or playoff Ben’s ceiling.  There's more if you read the article."
"Really isn’t a hard choice for the sixers, you’ve got Joel Embiid who’s a borderline MVP candidate and the other hand you got Ben can’tshootwon’tshoot Simmons claiming his defense and assists are all that matter.."
"And Simmons or Doc or any teammate could have thrown him under the bus when he shot 4/20 from the field in a 3 point loss in game 4.  Or for his 16 turnovers in games 6 and 7.  But they didn't.  I like Joel a ton and I don't care for Ben very much, but Embiid definitely didn't help much with his comments."

Embiid played 31 games and then got injured the next year. It's not like Joel was healthy and not playing.
Joel embIId.
"""Give me your ring""- Joel embiid"
"Regular season games missed in the last five years and respective ages:  * Anthony Davis - 83 games missed, 28 years old  * Kawhi Leonard - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * Steph Curry - 115 games missed, 34 years old  * Joel Embiid - 131 games missed , 27 years old  * Kevin Durant - 147 games missed, 33 years old"
"\*”When Joel has not been durable, Ben’s been durable,”\*  &amp;#x200B;  Running up the court and passing the ball to someone else doesn't often lead to injuries. Playing hard, getting double and tripled teamed and having guys hack the shit out of you (like Embiid) leads to injuries."
"He is the reigning MVP, but Embiid firmly leading the race before his injury. Considering the post is assuming health, bringing up the MVP doesn’t seem like a great argument.   The 3 point threat also isn’t a huge plus for Jokic, he shot 39% to Joel’s 38% last season, and was worse than Joel the season before."
"Since I can't respond to your other comment I'm going to respond to this one.   Ben Simmons series stats: 9.9/6.3/8.6 on 0.532 TS%. Joel Embiid: 30.4/12.7/3.9 on 0.588 TS%. Simmons quite literally scored 32% of the points Embiid did on worse efficiency including a pathetic 15/45 at the FT line with a higher TO% than Embiid. Sure, he did a good job on Trae but Trae got his own and was able to facilitate at an effective level while being able to hide defensively. Simmons, beyond his defence, did what exactly? A lot of his assists were given quite generously to him so I'd happily argue his facilitation was not on par with Trae's.   Embiid did miss a go ahead layup in game 4, you're right and that is the game he missed every shot in the second half but still hit 4 FT's the second half to score. If Embiid was struggling you'd expect Ben Simmons to do something right? No, he took one shot in the 2nd half and sunk both his FT's. He had an obvious option to alter the game offensively but didn't. He's 24 too so exerting too much energy one end isn't an excuse, especially in an era where offensive production is more valuable.  Let's not even discuss the fact that during the last 2 minutes in a series with 6 games decided by less than 10 points Simmons was played off the court because he was so terrible at the FT line AND having a worse defensive rating than Embiid while providing worse offensive production. Simmons was radically worse than Embiid and it isn't even close.  https://www.nba.com/game/phi-vs-atl-0042000204/box-score https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01/gamelog-playoffs/ https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2021-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-hawks-vs-76ers.html"
"My ex was a huge 76rs fan and the past 5 years I’ve watched most of their games. They are still my number two team. Joel is dominate and if you don’t enjoy watching the joy he plays with when he is on you are dead inside.   A defensive big who can space and move off ball well is a pretty spot on distribution of what Aaron Gordon does, and Grant before him. Simmons would feast in that role as well. A really good playmaker from the guard is easier to find, but finding our need isn’t impossible by any means.  Joel has had serious issues with underperforming in clutch situations. Getting swept by the Celtics and his late game turnovers this year exposed some places that are holding his team back. Shot creation without Simmons has also been an issue of his. You could build a championship team around Embiid a bit easier using more a traditional scheme but you can build a better team around Jokic."
Except as a one on one defender Jokic sucks.   Joel was being dragged out because nobody could stay in front of Trae forcing Joel to the free throw line because of his nasty floater. Leaving lobs open.   If you genuinely think they are remotely close on D then you don't watch enough of Joel Embiid. The defensive gap is FAR bigger than any perceived offensive gap.
"If you watch that series and think Trae was abusing Joel idk what to tell you.  They were attacking Curry relentlessly, forcing Embiid to guard wayyyyy more of the floor than he should have.  So of course Traes gonna get his.    Our guards were getting blown by every play causing Embiid to have to move up and guard traes pull ups."
"Yup, Embiid even signed an extension.   &gt;Critically, the Sixers believe they have the buy-in of Joel Embiid to carry out this strategy. In spite of the distance between the two over the summer and the shade cast in both directions through public interviews and leaked reports, Embiid ultimately just wants to win, and has expressed a desire to get Simmons in the fold and working toward contending. If Simmons proves stubborn or uninterested in doing so, the team believes Embiid is onboard with not settling for a trade just to be done with the problem altogether. To win a title, Embiid is aware they need star-level talent, whether that means winning Simmons back over or waiting for a star to get antsy in another market."
"The Sixers may not be in a rush, but you know who is?  Joel Embiid"
"LeBron James was the betting favorite to win MVP on March 13th 2021, a week before his ankle injury  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2935956-lebron-james-passes-joel-embiid-as-mvp-betting-favorite-after-76ers-cs-injury  But yeah, I'm a ""delusional homer"" lmao foh dude"
He’s had a slow start to this year but he would for the past two seasons.  He hasn’t been able to lead his team to the playoffs cause the kings have sucked. He’s had very mediocre help and awful coaching while playing in the west. What exactly has Ben done without superstar Joel Embiid ?
"Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Donovan Mitchell  Jayson Tatum  Trae Young  Devin Booker  Zion Williamson  Chris Paul  Rudy Gobert  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Bradley Beal  Paul George  Jrue Holiday  Khris Middleton  Julius Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Klay Thompson  DeAndre Ayton  Ja Morant  Karl-Anthony Towns  Domantas Sabonis  Zach LaVine  Brandon Ingram  Tobias Harris  Nikola Vucevic  CJ McCollum  Jamal Murray  Kyle Lowry  Draymond Green  Pascal Siakam  Evan Mobley  Darius Garland  Pretty sure that's over 40 players, but injuries aside, I'd take all of them before Simmons in a playoff series. People don't realize just how talented the league is right now. 40 sounds like a lot but when you list 'em out? It seems about right."
"&gt;I’ve heard this from some executives, too, that when Joel Embiid was healthy and before their recent losing streak, this team was performing well without him. Some executives said to me it further in their eyes lowered the trade value for Ben Simmons.  Alternatively- ""The Sixers are losing without Simmons, so they are desperate and have to trade him, lowering the price""  Heads we win, tails you lose."
"&gt; And I already know that TS% incorporates 3's/weighs them differently. That's why I used FG% to compare, because Curry takes most of shots from 3 while Lebron's in 2015 were mostly at the rim. So I needed a fair comparison, which was FG%.   You didn’t need a “fair comparison”, you needed a way to negate Curry’s greatest skill because it contradicts your predetermined narrative.   There’s a reason no one uses FG% anymore in arguments about efficiency - it’s an archaic metric that doesn’t even come close to measuring a player’s efficiency…unless you’re ready to argue that DeAndre Jordan is a better offensive player than Joel Embiid because he shoots a higher FG%."
"I remember one game, I think it was when he was with Atlanta, he had a 30pts and 30 reb game against the Sixers and Joel Embiid was playing in that game."
"Yeah and they had Bam Adebayo above Joel Embiid.  I love Bam and think he's a very good player, but you're legitimately smoking crack if you would take him over Joel Embiid"
"While the 76ers struggle to look for a team to trade for all star point guard Ben simmons, they should at least consider a three way deal that involves Kyrie Irving and Russel Westbrook. It is proven that irving is lost because of the vaccine issue and basically the nets seems to already move on from him since they already have harden and Patty mills. Nets seem to lack a facillitator point guard not a scorer so simmons might be a good fit. Westbrook on the other hand seems to struggle to fit in the laker culture with all these lowest of low games despite having highest of high games(which he is not consistent with) so he seems to be quite fit when he plays with a team with at least 1 allstar big in the name of Joel Embiid, embidd plus westbrook would be a threat to the pick and roll game and would crush the boards and wreck havoc inside. Then that puts us left with irving going to LA, him reconciling with bron + playing with AD(a better PF than love) would make a lot more sense. Considering irving is also lost without bron, this trade would really make sense and would shock the whole nba."
"I mean even the most simplistic and rudimentary test of that would be to see if they contribute to wins more offensively or defensively in the playoffs. Giannis: 2 OWS 1.7 DWS. Embiid: .7 OWS .8 DWS, and that DWS is oddly inflated considering Capela and Collins averaged 22 on 56% combined in the paint alone.  What about some of the greatest defensive players of all time?   Tim Duncan: 20.5 OWS 17.4 DWS.  Hakeem: 11.9 OWS 10.7 DWS.  Micheal Jordan: OWS: 27.3 DWS: 12.4  Kawhi Leonard: OWS: 14.6 DWS 7.9.  What about the playoffs last year in general, if all things are equal you'd expect the win shares per 48 minutes to be evenly split among offensive and defensive guys, and if defense is where the value is really at then would you not expect them to fly to the top of the list?  1. Damian ""No Defense"" Lillard: .286 ws/48 2. Kawhi ""4x the OWS as my DWS"" Leonard: .277 ws/48 3. James ""Cmon Now"" Harden: .263 ws/48  In fact I implore you to see what kind of player leads every regular season, or every playoffs, in win shares. It is either a guy who is just incredible offensively all year/all playoffs (because offense is, though you contest it, vastly more valuable and unique than defense) or it's a two-way player like the HOFers above that does both things but the OWS are always greater because again, offense is straight up a greater contributor to winning than defense past a certain threshold.   I mean damn how come the league's best defense (Utah) with the best singularly defensive player by far (Gobert) lose every damn year, and yet we see something like the Nets vs. Bucks last year which saw KD almost pull out an incredible upset not off his defensive prowess, but because he could not be stopped from scoring; and how did that series end? With Giannis (40) dueling KD (48) and just barely getting the win.  And the finals, how did they end? With Giannis dropping 50 points on 75% TS for an OBPM of 13.6 and a DBPM of 5 while/because the rest of his team couldn't score at all.  &gt; Like the Bucks had a top 5 postseason defence ever and Embiid reduces opponents scoring by 10pts per hundred when he checks in, in the postseason.  Imagine what that top 5 postseason defense would have looked like if Giannis weren't an elite scorer who was, by every metric, more valuable as a scorer than a defender.   Jrue was the best defender in that series, the on/off numbers for the Bucks are worse when Jrue is off compared to Giannis, but he couldn't score worth a damn which ended up seeing many less ws, less bpm, everything.   As far as Embiid reducing scoring by 100pts per hundred when he checks in, that may very well be true and yet, by every metric, it's the Philly offense which struggles the most and is most improved by Joel Embiid being on/off the court.   As a team (and this isn't a perfect measure because of how benches play vs starters, but it is important to note) Philly had a 118 ORTG and 106 DRTG when Joel was on the court. When he's off the court they have a 106 ORTG and a 106 DRTG. That basically equates to the bench being able to play even with the other team when he's out with whoever is out there for both teams, but when he goes in vs. whoever is out there Philly outscores their opponent by a boat load. By far the biggest swing on the team.   &gt; Defence &gt;&gt; Scoring. High level playmaking may be the most valuable skill but tell me when someone scores 25 with fewer than 3.5 assists a game (without an elite playmaking teammate) leads a team to a top seed. And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  I'm sorry but this has just never been the case. It has never, ever, ever, been the case. The famous phrase ""great offense beats great defense"" is a cliche and staple for a reason. Because it's true.   I don't know what your point is here with the whole 3.5 assists thing, which seems really arbitrary because if someone has the ball in their hand to score 25 a game they will find 4 assists a night whether they were looking to or not.   For instance Kawhi and Paul George are both not great passers, they averaged 5 assists each last year by virtue of the ball really only being in their hands to make decisions with, They were 4th in the west and would have finished higher if not for injuries.  What about, I dunno, the 01 Lakers? That was a good team. Kobe averaged a team high 5 assists, but it's not like he was looking to pass and most of that was a dump in to Shaq. He scored 28 a game. They went 16-1 in the playoffs.  What about the 2012 OKC Thunder? Durant had 3.5 assists. Harden had 3.5 assists. Russ had 5.5 but he turned it over 3.6 times a game which is a horrendous AST/TO ratio and indicative of someone who is absolutely not an elite playmaker. They went to the Finals.  How about the championship Rockets? Vernon Maxwell and Kenny had 4 and 5 assists a game but that was from dumping it into Hakeem over and over again. Nobody would call them elite or even very good passers/playmakers. They won back to back championships.  I can find a billion examples like this through NBA history, so I suppose I have now told you that and if you need 10 more teams who were a top 3 seed in NBA history with no elite playmaking teammates I'll be glad to find them for you.   &gt; And I'll stand here and point at Gobert who has been doing just that for like the last 6 seasons.  Doing what? Leading Utah to a top seed? Well first and foremost you break your own rule here because Donovan Mitchell averaged 26 and 5 assists, and Conley is in there with 16 and 6 as well so there's that.  Secondly, how's that been working out for Utah? They keep losing series because Conley gets banged up and Donovan Mitchell ends up being a wildly inefficient scorer and they can't keep up with better offensive teams. The Denver Nuggets came back on them 3-1 through offense alone.   3 of the Nuggets wins were them just hanging 117 points a game on them, and then there was the last game which was just everyone being nervous and shitting themselves and the Nuggets pulling it out. Ultimately because Jokic was the only player on either team who scored over 22 points or shot over 50% from the floor.  I haven't even pointed out that a purely defensive player (outside of Gobert and Utah had no other option anyway) has never gotten paid like a purely defensive player at the top level of those. Teams pay people to win them games. Teams know that guys who can have elite offensive production night in and night out are by far the most valuable players in the NBA.   I mean damn dude your own team has Steph Curry, by far the most valuable piece of that franchise by galactic proportions, and for his entire career he has been a poor on ball defender and a solid team defender--this season he's been good overall though.   Look at Houston. They continued to get top seed after top seed with James Harden at the helm who was putting up 35ppg, throwing passes to the corner, and playing 0 defense.   The Nuggets up until this year have continued to get top seeds because Nikola Jokic might be the best offensive player in the league. Who are the other two highest paid/impactful players on that team last year? Jamal Murray who is an average defender at best but puts up 20 ppg, and Michael Porter Jr. who is now a maxed player and remains one of the worst defenders in the league but put up the 2nd highest efficiency season of all time for people scoring over 17ppg.  The fact of the matter is finding elite offensive production is just vastly more difficult than finding elite defensive production, not only because a huge portion of defense is just will and hustle to do it, but it's also extremely schematic. Now more than ever.   If you don't want to believe me I suggest you read this 2014 mega deep dive about if offense or defense is more impactful for winning a championship. The conclusion there is that neither is particularly more important than the other (though elite offensive player is the most important of all players), and now in 2021 offense is more important than it was in 2014 by quite a bit and that gap has widened.   [Does Defense Really Win Championships In The NBA?](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2265297-does-defense-really-win-championships-in-the-nba)"
"Jokic was a solid 3rd in March behind Lebron and Embiid before both of them got injured. This is something that is very easy to go back and check, I'm not sure why people keep lying with the whole ""he was ahead anyways"" narrative.

"Top 2 picks in this city just don’t work out, like ever. Wentz had one great year and then everything turned to shit, Fultz forgot how to shoot a basketball, Evan Turner was fine but never really did much, we all see what’s happening with Simmons (although to his credit he’s been fantastic in the regular season, just not in the playoffs), Mickey Moniak’s never really done much outside of having an elite baseball name, Pat Burrell was fine but never really did all that much, JD Drew is one of the most hated athletes in Philly of my lifetime, Nolan Patrick turned out to actually be bad which is super cool considering the three guys drafted right after him are all superstars, and JVR has been good here since coming back but was originally traded and played out his prime in Toronto. It’s genuinely insane how shitty this city’s luck with top 2 picks has been, especially since the last two guys picked third here were Joel Embiid and Lane Johnson."
"The 90s had all-time greats listed here. For Joker's era, it's a lot better so you right, but other Cs that have a shot at all-time greats is Joel Embiid... maybe KAT, and depends on if we want to flub positions for Giannis and AD. Where are we on Clint Capela and Mile Turner?  Joker is pretty awesome, but his going up against greats who had to battle out other greats (and they get the nostalgia boost)  All I'm saying this era makes is weird for Centers."
Okay now I know you're trolling. Philly couldn't win shit with Simmons either and they have fucking Joel Embiid lol
"...of all time? Really?  The man has played 7 playoff series, winning four of them if I understand this correctly. That was as a 1, 1, and 2 seed...so they were favored in all except the last one?  Joel averages 6 more ppg and more than 1 extra rebound and block than Jokic, against 3.6 extra assists.  He also draws shoots twice as many free throws, causing trouble for the opposing team.  Now, I wouldn't argue that Embiid is ""the greatest center of his generation"". Jokic is amazing!  But a guy who has two seasons above 20.1 ppg isn't going to the hall of fame quite yet. Calm down :)"
Whos the better #1 Option: Andre Iguodala or Joel Embiid
So Devin Booker &gt; Joel Embiid because he's beaten LeBron and went to the Finals?
Healthy Joel Embiid is still more skilled than Jokic.
"Y’all ride Jokic’s scrotum waaay to hard in this subreddit 🤷🏽‍♂️ again, basketball is basketball and stats are stats…they are not the same thing. Jokic was not the best player in the league last year. Joel Embiid and LeBron James we’re running away with the MVP award until they both got hurt. Kevin Durant and James Harden both had better cases than Jokic before they went down with injuries. Steph Curry had a better case than Jokic, but his team wasn’t very good. Hell, at the end of the season even Dame and CP3 were getting MVP consideration.   All that to say, yes…Jokic is very good. An excellent player. He produces insane stats. And he’s still never been close to being the best player in the NBA."

Simmons actually wanted Embiid to apologize for this. It's a joke.
Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid?? Unless the min is 10 games or something
Joel Embiid would like a word with you
"“The Sixers are nothing to him” lol they’re his employer and they own him as a Player. You honestly think Joel Embiid is gonna give a shit if Simmons came out talking trash about him? Lol maybe by doing that he’d earn a little more respect, and the sixers don’t care he if goes out there and plays terrible, they just need to prove to other teams that he’s gonna play if traded! We have Maxey, we’re fine."
I don’t think 76ers are 5th because of Benamin. They were first until the team got wrecked with Covid protocols. Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris missed a good chuck of games last week so that dropped them down.
"Exactly. Most people criticizing the sixers have never even watched most of their games, Philly did everything to accommodate him, Doc rivers did nothing but support all last season in the media, Embiid praised him on Twitter last season BEFORE all of this happened. Obviously Doc and Joel shouldn’t have said what they said but tensions were high and they lost a game 7 at home."
"If you told me ""Joel Embiid gets you 18 more wins"", I'd say ""yeah. That sounds right."""
&gt; He’s the most dominant player in the NBA  Kinda say the same for embiid    The only thing that can stop Joel is Joel
"They disappointed because he doesn’t have the offensive skills to punish small ball, not because he was doo doo on defense. For every rim protecting center in the league, they will bleed points to a small ball lineup. Not because they’re bad on defense, but because if they have to slide over to provide help they’re leaving someone wide open at the 3 point line. The jazz bleeded so many points because their perimeter defenders sucked, Gobert had to cover for their mistakes, and had to leave someone wide open. If anything Gobert did a better job than most people in that situation.  Gobert disappointed because he wasn’t able to take advantage of that small ball lineup. Imagine if the clippers tried to pull that against Joel Embiid. Embiid would go absolutely crazy on the offensive end, shoot 60+% from the field and so on. That would force teams to go big again. Gobert can’t do that."
"Are you guys ready for this boiling hot take?  I think Joel Embiid is taller than Trae Young, and it's not even close."
"&gt; its pretty obvious that that the lakers problems extend beyond no Lebron  Based on ?  &gt; the sixers have looked a lot better without their best player than the lakers have  lol ""Joel Embiid is significantly easier to replace than LeBron James. More news at 10."""
"[Beavshak] I asked Ben Simmons what a defense is supposed to do when him and Joel Embiid both have it going: ""Nay,"" he said. ""No shooting."""
You mean the multiple years of tanking that got them Joel Embiid?
School of Joel Embiid
"Here are some other top 10 players with their ages and how many games they've missed over the last 5 years before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  AD ain't nearly as fragile as you guys want him to be. The only time he's missed a significant amount of games with an injury in the last 6 years was last year following the shortest off-season in history, and he's still only 28 years old. I disagree with the idea that any team needs to wrap their star players in bubble wrap. Should we be worried that Steph Curry is averaging 34 mpg when he's about to turn 34? Or that Kevin Durant is averaging 35 mpg at age 33? I don't think so. And we similarly shouldn't be worried that AD is averaging 35 mpg at age 28."
"The state of the Sixers’ team impacts the value of those incoming assets though. Joel Embiid is 27, they don’t need draft picks."

The Joel Embiid special
Yup even before he pulled this there was no trade rumored that literally wasn't better than just straight up voiding his deal vs taking on shit contracts from other teams.  &amp;#x200B;  He has made it much more difficult to trade him. And if the Sixers trade their only huge non Embiid asset for zero they might as well start shopping Joel too because this core's chance at contention is over.
"&gt;	Did his team have his back when Embiid said Ben's passed dunk was the turning point in the loss? Did the team have his back when Doc couldn't answer whether Ben was a championship guard?  It wasn’t?  Is he?  What was *unreasonable* in those?   …not just that they were negative and about him.  That’s not enough.  What were they supposed to have his back for there?  Claim he’s playing amazing and made perfect decisions?   Make themselves laughingstocks just to spare Ben some well-earned criticism? Friends don’t shield each other from harsh truth.  Having your back doesn’t mean letting you fail and then patting you on the back like you done good and are all-star material, never change bro.   That’s what I mean when I say they’re not obliged to *lie* for him. If they start lying to shield him from *reasonable criticism*, that harms them.  They can’t pretend not to see what fans were capable of seeing and were already talking about, just to spare Ben some exposure to reality.    &gt;	Did the team have his back when Doc compared Ben to a Qanon follower? Did the team have his back when Joel said ""I don't care about that man. He does what he wants""?  Check the dates on those, wise guy.  Sep 24 and Oct 19, both which are after Ben threatened to stop showing up to work, Sep 1, and failed to show for team events.  While the earlier two are incredibly mild.   But even still, you’re misrepresenting both those and their timing; each of those was in response to *after* Ben had done something that warranted comment.    All throughout, his team and coach were *also* stating quite publicly that they liked him, liked playing with him, and wanted him on the team.  Which is a massive gaping omission while you’re trying to paint them as being mean to him based on public statements.   &gt;	Ben complained over the summer and requested a trade back then so your statement that he never brought up his complaints until now is false.  He complained about being on Philly and not getting traded, not about the team environment or anything like what you’re trying to claim here.    &gt;	literally said he needs to work on his mental in his postgame interview after the Game 7  And then forgot about it, entirely, until remembering in October that the CBA protects “mental health”-related performance issues from nonpayment fines.    Why the five-month gap?  Why wouldn’t he provide Philly with even *basic* information about his treatment over that five months?  Are we supposed to believe that a genuinely top player who is actually motivated to succeed would publicly state they need to work on their mental - and then not do anything meaningful about it?  Pull the other one.    …that’s why that shit fictional.  He hadn’t been working on his mental, had no mental issues to provide documentation from - he just slumped, couldn’t take the criticism, and then dug his own hole trying to toss out excuses where he’s both unable to perform on court for Philly and also still one of the best players out there."
"Did his team have his back when Embiid said Ben's passed dunk was the turning point in the loss? Did the team have his back when Doc couldn't answer whether Ben was a championship guard? Did the team have his back when Doc compared Ben to a Qanon follower? Did the team have his back when Joel said ""I don't care about that man. He does what he wants""?  Ben complained over the summer, has been seeing an NBPA mental specialist for months, and requested a trade back then so your statement that he never brought up his complaints until now is false.  &gt;First it was just the fans are mean, then he needs to leave town, then he won’t show up to practice if they won’t move him, then he “needs to work on mental”  He literally said he needs to work on his mental in his postgame interview after the Game 7 loss to the Hawks. Are you literally braindead?"
"Doc said that he might not be the point guard for a championship team, he might have to play another position (because he's unplayable as a point guard in key moments).  And Embiid said that a turning point in the momentum of the game was when ""we"" had an opportunity that ""we"" didn't take advantage of.  So... Doc acknowledged that he isn't suited to playing the point in the modern NBA (what with how he's dogshit in the half court and a liability on offense) and Joel Embiid identified the turning point of a key game where the team didn't capitalise on an opportunity.  Wow.  Harsh."
"Here is an interesting quote from the article ""Simmons’ trade request in June followed a Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals, after which Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid made critical public comments about Simmons’ play. Neither Rivers nor Embiid has apologized to Simmons for those remarks, sources said.""  We might see this be used for one of the main reasons Ben Simmon's current mental health decline.  It will be interesting if doc rivers or Joel are asked if they ever apologize to him."
"Okay so the argument has gone from Joel embiid is the issue to Tobias Harris is the issue. Now Tobias not being enough of a shooter at 40% on 4 attempts, when Ben, who’s a point guard doesn’t take ANY. It’s pretty clear to see who the issue is and you keep moving the goal posts here. Have a good one."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/joel-embiid-ben-simmons-holdout-sixers-nba-training-camp%3famp  “I feel like I can really play with anybody and I  can make anybody be better on the court. I don’t necessarily need shooters. But I feel like over the years — like you look at when we got Al (Horford), it’s because we needed a stretch five, just to make sure that was for him. And most of my career I’ve had to kind of step out to the three-point line quite a bit” — Joel Embiid  I mean if you don’t wanna take my word for it, here’s Joel’s so idk what you’re trying to argue. I completely disagree with the notion that a 40% shooter in Tobias is taking away from the spacing required for Ben to drive.   Ben’s issues are his own, the sixers have put talent around him and he hasn’t expounded on his game since he entered the league."
"Embiid is taking just as much now possibly more with Ben out  The real killer to the duo was maxing tobias Harris, a player who hurts both Joel and Bens game  And not getting an actual elite perimeter creator to play with them"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/section215.com/2021/09/28/philadelphia-76ers-simmons-style-embiid/amp/  “Simmons believes that playing around (Joel) Embiid’s style isn’t conducive to the way he needs to play.”  Yes, he does. He claims that a top 10 player in the league last year, closer to 5, was holding him back."
I have anxiety that's bad enough that it's put me in the hospital because I was pretty much unable to function. So yeah I won't be too thrilled if he's using it as an excuse just because he's upset Joel Embiid said he should've gone for an easy dunk.
"Sure, they probably could've had it sooner, but Joel Embiid isn't walking into a CVS for his booster shot."
 he has trained James Harden and Joel Embiid. Ok
"Joel embiid really kills offensive flow.  So does Ben Simmons.  Embiid is getting better this year now that Simmons is gone.  But embiid being a black hole with the ball kills a lot of opportunities to pass or move the ball to get open looks.  Really makes our team rely so much on taking bad/mediocre shots, and not get into a rhythm with passing.  Combined with a lot of other factors like injury, and conditioning(which means he had to take plays off and run down the floor slow) it really is a lot of negatives.  Also you will almost never see embiid in position for an easy slam or alley oop becAuse it’s basically all just looking for post up opportunities or working the midrange.    When guys like Drummond or Howard come in, you can really see how much the 76ers are missing not having a center who can alley oop."
"Yo OP, your tables are a little messed up. If you put --- | --- | --- | --- between the header and the rest of the table, it will change it into a much better looking version:  Player|2021-21|2020-21|Diff ---|---|---|--- Damian Lillard|3.2|7.2|-4 Bradley Beal|4|7.7|-3.7 Trae Young|5.3|8.7|-3.4 Collin Sexton|3.5|6.4|-2.9 James Harden|4.6|7.3|-2.7 De'Andre Hunter|1|3.7|-2.7 Kyle Lowry|1|3.5|-2.5 Kemba Walker|1.2|3.5|-2.3 Donovan Mitchell|3.9|6|-2.1 Joel Embiid|8.6|10.7|-2.1  Well, I had to change the spaces between the numbers into | but it looks better that way, and you can even sort it based on the column"
I wonder what would've happened if the sixers traded Simmons for Kawhi.  They would've had Jimmy Butler or Joel Embiid as their third best player in the playoffs. Maybe Kawhi even stays.
"Sixers were also missing Curry.  Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid would be a very good starting 5.   Donte, Brook, and Thybulle off the bench is not a bad 8 man rotation."

Joel Embiid punching Lonzo Ball.
"I completely disagree with that.  Who he was on the Kings is who he is? The ignorance on that statement is appalling, people are not static things.   And for defense, go check defensive ratings. Demarcus cousins has a higher average than Joel embiid. Just sayin, sounds like you didn't watch cousins at all in his prime and are just an embiid fanboy"

"I just hope that when Joel Embiid finds himself in a similar situation, people are this quick to defend him."
I’m sure Embiid does his fair share of flopping or whatever but at least part of why he appears to lose his balance a lot is cause he’s trying to go with the flow of impact rather than try to resist it every time to help prevent injury:   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/05/10/joel-embiid-falls-down-a-lot-because-his-doctors-told-him-to/
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
"Yes, and neither does Joel Embiid, that’s my point dumbass. You idiots let him walk instead of riding the best roster in the eastern conference to at least two easy rings over the next 5 years. For a player that won’t suit up healthy because he hates his teammates and himself.  I’m a Dolphins fan, I know it sucks to Stan a shit organization. It doesn’t mean you have to pretend Jimmy isn’t tough because you clown dicks gave him away."
"Dont be ridiculous. Taking recent events AD played lesser games than Embiid for the past 3 years. If exception has to be made for Embiid, it has to be made for AD.  If youre that confident you guys will be top 10, why you are so afraid of 1 Joel Embiid?"

"So much desire.

"I think this also has to do with Tobias Harris missing games so far this year too. With him out it’s truly all 3 and D players around Embiid and Drummond except for Maxey. I’m not suggesting that we are better without Tobias, but I am suggesting the offense generates more 3s and it helps Joel, especially late in games."
Lol that’s great. Jaylen Brown? Is Philly including Joel Embiid in the trade too?
"Could you imagine a defense with Joel Embiid, Al Horford, and Josh Richardson? No one would be able to score on them!"
"Tl;dr it doesn’t mean anything they just wanted a name for their advanced stat aggregator and the Raps just won the championship:  At FiveThirtyEight, we’ve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our “CARM-Elo” season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).  But that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight’s new NBA statistic. We’re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:  First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn’t available in traditional box scores.  Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.  NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things — not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.  /u/velvithippo"
Just pointing out the irony of someone calling ad glass with a Joel embiid flair.  And I like your attempt at a joke before you edited it better
"Exactly.  And what we HEAR is that Kyrie has MUCH less clout right now and confidence in the eyes of team FO’s than a guard such as dame.    Essentially, your initial claim is a completely different argument than your response.  It’s not unreasonable to say Daryl wants Dame or a similarly styled player, and so would Jo.  It’s documented that Jo is in the loop on this strategy.  To suggest by that, that Daryl would take Kyrie off the rip is not nearly as reasonable of a take, because nothings even been HEARD about that, as you put it.  Then your final claim, that Daryl has “little faith in Embiid” based on your first claim of Daryl taking Kyrie is pretty moot, and pretty out there. Especially considering that Joel has been made aware of this strategy and accepted it, so even he must be aware of the team’s needs.    Your take is simply not grounded in fact or reality and thus it’s a pretty stupid one to be criticizing Daryl over."
I also thought he sucked. Glad to see I have the basketball IQ of Joel Embiid
"This sub yesterday: “Joel Embiid is having a piss poor start to the season and the Sixers are still winning, they barely need him”  This sub today: “Here’s a random ass stat that shows why Embiid is the best passer in the league and that Jokic is a bum who’s team record sucks”"
"Yeah I agree with you on this 100%.  Plenty of folks definitely do that 2 step ""Ben sucks we need to trade him"", so ""trade him for Lillard"".  That is not me, though I am not fully on board that he is a ""superstar"" (he is not, some of those folks out there too), but he is more of a throwback to a guy (and you hear this plenty of broadcasts on other teams) who brings the ball up, drives and kicks or gets you into that set and gets your scoring options in a position to make plays, while also providing elite defense on the opposing teams best player 1-4 (Ben is not a rim protector).   I think he is a great player that had his Tragic Johnson moment, but ultimately I am not sure how he bounces back mentally.  I don't think he will ever learn to shoot, after being in the league this long he is what he is, but there are tons of teams (like Minnesota for example) who desperately need perimeter defense and playmaking who also have no shortage of people willing to just jack up threes including their center.  Ben is a great fit in a lot of places, and even with Embiid Joel was also statistically better with Ben on the floor then without him (and Joel has struggled this year too so this statement is still true)."
Joel Embiid is that guy that doesn’t understand other people have feelings
"Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 1996-97:   MJ 14.7, Terrell Brandon 11.1, Mitch Richmond 11.0, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 9.6, Karl Malone 9.5, Glenn Robinson 9.4  Top 6 in mid-range shot per game, 2020-21:   Russ 6.1, Brandon Ingram 5.8, Julius Randle 5.8, Bradley Beal 5.6, Joel Embiid 5.6, CP3 5.5  That's a 45-50% drop, dude. And BTW, ALL of these dudes are noted standout offensive players."
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"Players (like Joel Embiid) get hurt. This is how teams like the Warriors, who still have Steph Klay and Draymond, end up with the #2 pick last year, and #7/14 this year. I get what you’re saying. The Suns pick especially isn’t that attractive. But I’m not going to be convinced that future firsts from non-dominant teams aren’t really valuable"
"Alright let’s analyze these picks then.     Your own picks, I agreed that these were valuable.     A sixers first. They currently have Joel Embiid and are looking to trade Simmons. At the absolute worst case scenario that they decide to trade Embiid instead (they won’t) they’ll be getting assets back that will keep them respectable.    Heat 1sts. There’s some potential for these to turnout but it’s entirely dependent on butler leaving it heavily regressing. Heat are also a very desirable FA destination so they’re essentially guaranteed to always be respectable or have a quick turnaround in rebuilds.     Suns 1st. Really? They’ve got Booker and Ayton as their core. You’d have to hope that CP3 and Mills Bridges leaves for some semblance of hope that Booker and Ayton can’t carry that team out of the lottery.     While I agree that the future is unpredictable. You have the picks of teams that essentially have a stable future for the next few years so this isn’t one of those cases you can use this point imo"
"Lopez and Ayton were both getting murdered pretty regularly while rebounding with no calls made.  I think Middleton suffers from being bigger, big dudes get less calls because refs suck, but that's kind of a constant (unless you're Joel Embiid)."
"Trey young, James harden, Marcus smart, jimmy butler, Joel embiid would all be right there with him.  These fuckers make a living at the line and  make the refs look incompetent, not difficult mind you."
"Embiid has gone to bat for Ben for years and modified his own game to suit Ben's limitations. Joel is the team. Even Doc has stuck up for Ben 99% of his tenure. After Game 7 is one of the only times anyone has openly doubted or criticized Ben in his whole career in Philly.  If it has to get tense or petty to make the trade, so be it. It's time for everyone to start fresh."
Wait til you see the Instagram post Ben Simmons’s cousin’s college roommate liked about Joel Embiid
"2020-21 Embiid is better than any version of AD so that's what people are basing it on. Admittedly there's also some recency bias with AD being hurt a lot of the year, but the fact he doesn't even have better availability than Joel Embiid of all people is the kind of thing that's always given people pause when trying to rank him"
"What I got from the story was that during exit interviews, it was agreed that Ben's three points of improvement were to: 1) improve free-throw shooting, 2) work on getting to the rim, and 3) improve his outside shot, and that he would work with the Sixers' shooting coach to improve his shooting.  Shortly thereafter, Ben's agent, Rich Paul and the Simmons family decided that the Sixers' shooting coach would no longer be working with him, and that he would be working with his brother to ""improve"" his shot.  &amp;#x200B;  [Source.](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/ben-simmons-postseason-struggles-philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid)"
"I thought Joel's comments were taken out of context? The headline that was being circulated was bad but I remember someone posting the full quote and it completely changed the context of his statement about Simmons.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/21/joel-embiid-brings-up-ben-simmons-not-dunking-as-turning-point-in-game-7/  &gt;I’ll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we – I don’t know how to say it. But I thought the turning point was just, we had an open shot and we made one free throw and we missed the other and then they came down and scored and we didn’t get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he made a 3 and then, from there down four. And then I got – it’s on me. I turned the ball over, tried to make something happen from the perimeter. But I thought that was the turning point.  Unless there was some other negative statement I'm missing, it really didn't seem like Joel threw Ben under the bus."
Ben Simmons is unreliable AND Joel Embiid is a bad teammate. Both can be true.
Joel Embiid
"Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic all have nasty post moves, and they are all objectively top 10 players currently. Elite post moves are far from a thing of the past"
"People don't understand the dilemma that not only the Sixers find themselves in but every other Eastern Conference contender. That dilemma is the Brooklyn Nets. They got pretty lucky this season with their injuries, I wouldn't bet on that happening again so teams need to plan with a fully healthy Nets in mind. Embiid + Tobias + &lt;insert non superstar&gt; isn't going to get you past that team. They need a superstar next to Joel *and* someone better than Tobias on top of that."
"But they already had Joel ""glass kneed"" Embiid."
His are close to empty assists  Alot of them are in transition just passing it to an open Joel Embiid or Seth Curry
"1) calm down  2) Embiid annihilated most players, it’s why he was MVP frontrunner through 40 games before his injuries and the Nuggets made a run. Meanwhile 29 teams out of 30 don’t have a guy like Joel Embiid"
I mean of course he would come back.  Trae Came back for game 6 elimination game.   Him coming back doesn't mean he's 100%.   Hyper-extended knee took Joel Embiid out of commission for 10 games and Giannis was worse. He'll definitely come back to play in the finals but he won't be 100% healthy and again like Suns are well rested
"I mean yeah, Joel weighs like twice what Trae does. It's harder to knock Joel over but he falls over every time he's got the ball. Embiid I would say gets hit way less, just because everyone knows you can't get close to him. Also his FTs were pretty on par with the regular season.   And Middleton clearly flopped, just like Trae did the play before."
2022 - Steph Curry  2023 - Joel Embiid  2024 - Giannis  2025 - Luka Doncic  2026 - Luka Doncic  2027 - Trae Young  2028 - Zion Williamson  2029 - Luka Doncic
Sixers just had too many weakness with simmon being it's vocal point that is easily exploited .   Joel embiid creating his shot from perimeter is also hurt to watch but can't do anything when simmon and simmon defender is literally around the basket.
"&gt; Otherwise everyone would be calling for suspensions for any hard foul. Like Beverly karate chopping the top of Ayton’s head, or LeBron shoving Joel Embiid from behind as he was mid-air or Jokic smacking Payne’s nose/face as he made a play on the ball.  As I think they should. If there's malicious intent, why should it matter if it is in play or during a stoppage? Personally, I think the key for suspension is intent, followed by severity of said act."
Once embiid played the tanking was over. He never even suited up when Hinkie was still the gm. Your take is all over the place how on earth would one even tank with Joel playing? The only failure was dumping Hinkie for ridiculous hasbeens
"Would we agree that there’s a difference between something that happens during play, like hard fouls, compared to what happens outside of that?   Otherwise everyone would be calling for suspensions for any hard foul. Like Beverly karate chopping the top of Ayton’s head, or LeBron shoving Joel Embiid from behind as he was mid-air or Jokic smacking Payne’s nose/face as he made a play on the ball.  There’s a clear difference between things that happen during play and outside of play and to suggest otherwise is disingenuous."
"The Sixers get criticized because they were SO overt about it.   The front office was setting a team up for failure.   What's more, they have little in the way to show for it.   Noel?   Okafor?  Michael Carter-Williams?  Markelle Fultz?  Elfird Payton/Dario Saric?   And Ben Simmons.  They spent YEARS losing to pick up all those players.  And the only one who is still with the team has show no progress in his five years with the team.   The only player who panned out was Joel Embiid, and they got him in 2016.    Trying to WIN and build organically around Embiid would have been far easier for the Sixers than tanking every years.  We've seen with the Warriors that exceptional scouting and player development is the best approach to the draft.  Their dynasty was build primarily through the draft (Curry, Klay, Dray, and Barnes), none of whom were even top-five picks, and a couple of shrewd trades (for Bogut) that made the team a landing spot for free agents like Durant.  When you are winning, free agents are drawn to your team.  They had a sucky year last year, and it was not much better this year due to injury, but they still made a sincere effort to reach the playoffs.  And they still have great draft positioning with a early first-round pick in Wiseman on the roster now, and two lottery picks coming their way.   Sure... you can fairly expect to suck for a couple years during a rebuild and get a couple of early picks, but don't stay down there for five years trying to draft your entire starting line-up. You'll just end up with a losing culture."
Joel Embiid? Kevin Durant? Also no Edwards? Thats a hot take.
"I don't think we can declare the Process a success or a failure until the Joel Embiid (and possibly Ben Simmons, or whatever assets we get for Simmons) era is over and we have or have not won a championship.  The ultimate goal of the Process was to accumulate as many assets as possible for talent accumulation because Hinkie knew that it wasn't possible to hit on every single draft pick.  It was okay that he missed on Noel and Okafor because they weren't his only chances.  Hinkie had some wins (draft + trade of MCW, drafting Embiid, drafting Saric - including the trade he swung to acquire a pick with Saric, drafting Simmons, signing Covington, Grant, McConnell), and he had some misses (Noel, Okafor, having zero competent point guards on the roster during the 1-30 start), but a large part of why the Process is perceived as a failure is due to the squandering of the treasure chest of assets post-Hinkie.  Yes, it's impossible to know what Hinkie would have done with those assets, but due to Adam Silver's meddling, we'll never know.  Hate on what Hinkie did all you want, but he played within the rules of the game and when the other owners got butthurt, he paid the price.  Look at all of the assets we used to acquire Butler (Covington and Saric), and Harris (Shamet, Miami 2021 pick - which was acquired in the Mikal Bridges trade).  The pick that was used to select Bridges came from the MCW trade.  It was stupid to choose Brett Brown over Butler, only to fire Brown one year later, but that wasn't Hinkie's doing.  Hinkie accumulated the assets that made it possible to acquire Butler and Harris.  Despite being down to the last remnants of the Process (Embiid and Simmons), Philly still has an opportunity to win a championship.  We haven't won one since 1983, and haven't even made the conference finals since 2001.  If we can win a championship with either Embiid and/or Simmons (or the Simmons assets), the Process will 100% be a success.  For everyone who says ""oh, but you suffered through all of the tanking years"".  I would 100% ""suffer"" through four years of losing basketball rather than be stuck in 7-10 seed purgatory for a decade.  I LOVED those early Process years.  There were zero expectations and it was refreshing watching all of those young guys try to find their place in the league.  Watching TJ McConnell, one of the original Processors hit that buzzer beating winner against the Knicks has been one of my top Sixer highlights.  tl dr; If Philly wins a title with Embiid and/or Simmons, the Process is a success.  If not, it's a failure."
"I think most people think of ""the process"" as tanking and drafting an injured Joel Embiid, letting him ""process"" through his injury for literal years. I'd say that has been an unequivocal success. Simmons could maybe be included too, but I'd say the jury is still out there, regardless of passing up an open dunk in an elimination playoff game. We'll never know the outcome of the original overall process since it was cancelled halfway through."
"It's D'Angelo Russell, the fit is seemless.  &amp;#x200B;  hes an elite shot creator that will fit perfectly with Joel Embiid and defense wont be a problem.  His handles are great and can actually be a halfcourt threat. Dlo is a Top Tier PnR threat in the league, him with Embiid is Dangerous."
"I'd argue embiid makes perimeter defense easier for those guys, than vice versa. rim protection is also way more valuable, raises the floor for team defense  Joel was a DPOY finalist in 2018 also, before he had any teammates make an All NBA defense"
"Id rather see them have Dlo, hes an elite shot creator that will fit perfectly with Joel Embiid and defense wont be a problem. Dlo is a Top Tier PnR threat in the league, him with Embiid is Dangerous."
"Hear that guys?! We have every advanced defensive metric that says Turner is one of the best defenders in the league, but the genius u/XcSDeadDeer thinks he should shut down Joel Embiid better so therefore he's actually trash. Fucking brilliant!"
"&gt; The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time  They should hang this in the rafters"
"The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time. The process was a resounding success. That was even after burning assets like Mikal Bridges and the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft.  Getting rid of Butler is the big mistake (in addition to the Fultz pick), but that happened post process. If they kept Butler, you have Butler, Harris, and Embiid which is a great big 3, and could have used Ben Simmons in trades more aggressively."
Very normal for Pompey yes  All that’s left is for Marcus Hayes to write a piece calling Joel Embiid a thug and we are set
"Yes, the hockey system of delayed foul is pretty much how it works in soccer. Both Hockey and Soccer protect offensive transitions (often the most exciting plays in the sport) by punishing the team that tries to break it up with fouling.  They call it ""playing the advantage"". The defensive team does not get an immediate stop to an attack from a lazy foul, and does not benefit from committing a tactical foul (stopping an offensive transition), and if they do there is some punishment to prevent it form happening again (soccer with the card system, hockey physically removes a player).  The fast break dunk is one of the most exciting things in basketball and the NBA does absolutely nothing to stop teams from using the ""take foul"".  My biggest problem is that it's considered ""smart"" to tactically foul, but fouling should not be rewarded by league rules. Fouling is a transgression against the rules so a team should not be intentionally benefiting from it.  If Ben Simmons gets a steal and starts a fast break, the league rules would reward his opponent for fouling him. Rather than getting 1.5 expected points (*from a probable dunk, contested layup And-1, a drive to the rim and kick for an uncontested 3*); the rules allow a defender to cynically tap him on the leg and completely stop the play, forcing a side out of bounds and defensive reset with 1 expected point per play.  Even worse in the 4th quarter of games when a poor FT shooter like Shaq or Ben Simmons can't be on the court, because the defensive team can be rewarded for fouling instead of playing defense. They don't even have to wait for the poor FT shooter to get the ball and lose the advantage, they can go out of their way and *intentionally foul* and be rewarded for their smart tactical choice. If Ben Simmons is standing at half court away from the action, the defensive team should have to guard a Joel Embiid post-up rather than getting rewarded for breaking the rules by running out to half court and fouling Simmons instead."
"As a prospect? Fucking easily. He was mobile when he came in and would he encouraged to lose weight instead of get even bigger and stronger. He’d be a bigger, stronger, and more athletic Joel Embiid, and would have had ample time to develop a jump shot.  Just dumping Shaq in his prime? Still dominant but definitely exploitable. He’s 320+ which is like 50 pounds heavier than anyone in the league right now, which means he’s not going to be able to close out to shooters or keep up with guards in the pick and roll. Hack a Shaq would also make him vulnerable in clutch situations, which combined with the former point means you pretty much have to take him in and out of any tightly contested game strategically."
Joel Embiid
"I think 2014 just has Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart  2013 is Cody Zeller, CJ McCullom, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Rudy Gobert  Pretty much it’s only the top players in any given draft and Cody Zeller who stays with their team 7+ years"
"""DON'T COMPARE AYTON TO ME. I PLAY DEFENSE""  - Joel Embiid"
Yeah I’m sure SGA would have had a *real* tough time making the playoffs if he was playing with Joel Embiid lol
Joel Embiid has never flopped in his NBA career.
"I’m not even sure how you can think that   Cousins best season: 27/11.5/3.3 on 45/33/72 2nd Team All-NBA, team was dogshit, 0 MVP votes   Embiid best season: 28.5/10.6/3 on 51/37/86, 2nd Team All-NBA, 2nd Team All-Defense, 2nd in MVP voting   Jokic best season: 26/11/8.3 on 56/39/87, 1st Team All-NBA, MVP   Cousins was good but to say he was ever better than what Joel and Joker did this year is asinine tbh"
"Joel ""No More Process(ed)"" Embiid"
And for the rando that just tried to message me calling me “a little bitch”…  I’ve been a Sixers fan for 20 years. Lived IN and around the city for close to 12 years. And Joel Embiid may be my favorite Sixer ever.  So man up and get a grip sir. 🙄
Look at what LeBron did to Mikael bridges and Joel embiid this year
Take Joel Embiid but give him better post moves and also he never gets hurt
I’m thinking 2 max. Smart did pretty much the same thing to Joel embiid and got a 50k(?) fine.
I’m hoping for Joel Embiid
"If I’m the Lakers, would I give Andre Drummond and a multitude of players and a pick for Joel Embiid? Hell yes I would  *Where is my check ESPN?*"
"Trae doesn't flop to the level Cp3 and Embiid tho, he foul baits and will lean into defenders after pumping faking and knows how to draw fouls on the drive but he doesn't do acting jobs over nothing like Chris and Joel"
"Bruh joel embiid did the same thing to john collins, they were diving for a ball, why would solomon hill care ab hurting a player in the regular season that isnt even in his conference."
"There are forwards and centers in today’s league that are better ball handlers than many of the shooting guards in the 90’s NBA.  ￼￼   This is no knock on Jordan whatsoever but go back and look at his ball handling and see how pedestrian it would be in today’s game.   Shit, Joel Embiid is a fucking oak tree and he has a pretty damn serviceable crossover and behind the back move. Can you imagine Patrick Ewing doing that every night?"
"Ben Simmons told Joel Embiid 'We will win a lot of rings', its been 3 years since this comment and they have not even made the conference finals"
"No it's not.  This season he shot 69.6% inside 8 feet and 46.0% from the midrange.  He was also assisted on 75% of his midrange shots.  That's not bad from midrange, but it's certainly not a bucket waiting to happen.  &amp;#x200B;  If you watched tonight's game, you'll see how they purposefully penetrated and fed Ayton layups.  That's where he's being hyper efficient.  Even Bridges had 2 drives where he dished to an open Ayton within 3 feet.  They did try to throw it into him for postups a couple times with mixed results.  Morris poked the ball out from Ayton a couple times, and Ayton had a couple no dribble hooks from within 8 feet.  &amp;#x200B;  I've seen plenty of Suns games.  It's just weird that you aren't looking at the stats to back up your eye test and telling me I don't watch them just because you disagree with my opinion.  It's not a sleight on Ayton that he can't consistently get his own buckets.  He's not Joel Embiid or AD yet, that's not the worst criticism."
"Lebron James two hand shoved Joel Embiid while he was in the air, an extremely dangerous play and much worse than anything Jae Crowder or Pat Bev did this series. He’s a dirty player. You should be ashamed to support him."
"Embiid.  Trae's skillset is somewhat easier to find elsewhere. Embiid is a spectacular offensive player who can stretch the floor and is a DPOY candidate.  And although the Hawks lockeroom stuff has quietened down, I think it's still valid to question whether there could be chemistry issues with Trae which isn't a concern in the slightest with Joel.  I'm also simply not a fan of the foul baiting and find Embiid more enjoyable to watch. When he's dominating a game, it's amazing.  Both great players, but give me the generational big man."
"Now they’re saying Joel Embiid has never actually played in the NBA at all, this has all been the fever dream of a 2015 Sixers fan"
How many GMs would trade Joel Embiid for Trae and this is coming from someone who loves Trae
Ask Joel Embiid.
Which is basically his season averages. He should be scoring way more with bismack biyombo out there. We went 2-0 vs the wolves this season and in comparison Joel Embiid is one of our worst nightmares and we are like 0-12 or something against him
Joel Embiid
Is Joel Embiid top 10..

"stumble pt 2   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe  Tim Bontemps: With the Pelicans feeling pressure to take significant steps forward in Zion Williamson's third season, this would be a huge swing by them to remake the roster. But it would also better balance New Orleans, and help to optimize the environment for Williamson to do his thing.  That would begin with moving on from Adams, whose fit didn't go the way executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin hoped after trading a first-round pick to get him from Oklahoma City -- and giving him an extension on top of it -- last summer. Turner, on the other hand, would provide the kind of floor spacing next to Williamson that would give him ample room in the paint to dominate, and would provide a level of rim protection that would be helpful, too.  The cost of the 10th pick would be painful -- but would be mitigated, in part, by the other part of this deal. The Pelicans would get Nance, a versatile forward who would allow them to either play big or small in the frontcourt, depending on if he's at small or power forward; Sexton, whom they could plug into the sixth man role he seems perfectly suited for; and Love, who would give them another stretch option, and who could give New Orleans another offensive option off the bench. Moving on from Bledsoe is also a win for the Pelicans, who would still have some money to spend to further improve the team.  The fit of Ingram and Williamson is awkward -- both are defensive negatives and are best suited to play power forward. Ingram would be a very good fit with the Cavaliers, though, where he could slide in next to Jarrett Allen in Cleveland's frontcourt, and would still allow general manager Koby Altman the flexibility to go whichever way he wants with the third selection in the draft. And getting the 10th pick to go with the 13th selection would give the Pacers an infusion of high-end young talent as Rick Carlisle takes over as head coach. Russ teams with Embiid, Simmons joins Beal  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Russell Westbrook, No. 15 pick  Washington Wizards receive: Simmons, George Hill  Andre' Snellings: This is a ""win right now"" move for the 76ers, pairing MVP runner-up Joel Embiid with former MVP Westbrook to form one of the most aggressive combos in the NBA. The very fire and will to win that has made them adversaries would make them a devastating combo as teammates, both at the stage of their careers where winning a championship is the one accomplishment they have yet to achieve on the court. Westbrook shares many of Simmons' on-court positives as a strong floor general and rebounder from the backcourt who can physically overwhelm opponents, but the pressure he can apply as a scorer who attacks the paint on every possession would make life much easier for Embiid, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and the rest of the 76ers' offense.  For the Wizards, Simmons is a better fit next to Beal than Westbrook. Beal is one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA, with a burgeoning ability to create for himself and teammates off the dribble to supplement his excellent shooting, but there was some redundancy with the ball-dominant Westbrook that led to diminishing returns. Simmons, on the other hand, could be the primary floor general tasked with putting Beal and the rest of the Wizards in great positions to score for most of the game -- and would willingly cede control to Beal in key moments. In those scenarios, Simmons could move to more of a big-man finisher and rebounder around the rim. And of course, on the other end, Simmons brings a Defensive Player of the Year-caliber presence and physical mismatch that would give the Wizards an entirely new dimension. Plus, the soon-to-be 25-year-old Simmons should be peaking on a similar time-scale as the recently-turned-28 Beal over the next handful of years.  Note: $1.2M of Hill's contract is currently guaranteed, with the rest scheduled to become guaranteed on Aug. 3. Because of salary-cap rules, Hill's contract would either have to be fully guaranteed at the time of the deal or the deal could not become official until Aug. 3."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"Joel ""Milk Shake "" Embiid"
Joel Embiid led the league in post ups per game by a pretty significant margin this year and you’re claiming that Doc forces him to play like a guard. So much of the Doc/Sixers bashing that’s gone on here after the loss has blatantly come from people who didn’t actually watch the team.
"Not that I disagree but how could your rationale be so, so wrong?  These teams are absolutely NOT playing like it's the 90s. How old are you?  And Joel Embiid is being forced to play like a guard? What the fuck are you on about? Who's forcing him to shoot 3s and try and shake and bake 15 feet from the basket?  Despite arriving at the correct conclusion, these are some of the dumbest takes I've ever read on here."
"Management cares only about money. As long as they're filling up the stadium and making deep playoff runs that's all that matters. These players are making millions dollars every year for shooting hoops. You think they care that much about their ""legacy""? Joel Embiid sitting in his mansion after retiring his parents guarantee you they're not thinking about that. It's a job to them."
Jayson Tatum (his dad too has an impeccable hairline)  Kyrie Irving  Jalen Rose  Bill Russell (he's 60 years older than me with a way better hairline smh)  Joel Embiid
Trae and the hawks took out the number one seed against embiid.  DefinitelyNot saying Joel isnt top ten but referencing why these lists are so dumb.
"this is in light of Hawks fans being called “class” for not cheering when Giannis suffered an unfortunate injury, but being called “classless” when Joel Embiid was injured here. There seems to be a debate on what actually happened"
"If you pay close attention to the audio, the crowd noise seems like it was muted prior to Joel Embiid rolling his ankle, and then it was resumed simultaneously with the injury. The sound is exactly the same as it was before the injury happend. Also it doesn’t sound like the crowd was actually cheering. It seems to sound more like general crowd noise than excitement over an injury. What do you think"
"not necessarily. you can come away from this with just a bad bone bruise, joel embiid did it earlier this year and missed three weeks. the PCL/ACL are definitely concerns though."
"&gt;The Sixers are completely botching Joel Embiid's championship window for refusing to move on from Ben Simmons and Doc Rivers this offseason. Your 7ft center is playing like a guard, not because he wants too, but because he is being forced too and he is on the 76ers since 2014. This is mind-blowing.  I've constantly said that the Sixers should have gone in on that Lowry trade. Not that would have guaranteed a championship. Truly, what can (eg look at the Nets right now)? But, having another elite ball handler, one that can shoot no less, would go a long way to helping the Sixers. If Lowry could have upped the Sixers chances of taking it all by even 5%, that would have been worth it.    Embiid is injury prone so I suspect his window is shorter than most think. And he was playing like an MVP this season. Really should have gone all in."
"Allen is not that much better than Poeltl. The Spurs also probably want to rebuild and dont really have key pieces for the next decade yet.  Poeltl is solid enough, Im not saying hes Joel Embiid.  Their incapable front office made them buyers. If they buy again and build around Fox / Allen / Haliburton they can do that, but theyll end up being a lottery team for the next 5 years."
Ah yes I'm sure doc and his staff never thought about trapping trae.   Ben Simmons at the 5 and Joel embiid at the bench. Sounds good
Joel Embiid has literally said he wants to be a point guard so it’s kind of hard to take you seriously after that claim in the second paragraph
"He was still strong at that weight too.   I remember reading an article about his pre-draft workout with the Cavs and they had him going one-on-one with 275-pound Vitaly Potapenko. Embiid was ""[throwing him around like a rag doll](https://cavaliersnation.com/2020/03/17/cavs-drafted-joel-embiid-after-he-trash-talked-david-griffin-pre-draft-workout/)"", despite looking like a toothpick.   Obviously he's a much better player now, but as an athlete, the bulking up and the injuries have taken a lot bounciness from him. In his rookie season he was flying all over the place defensively; definitely bouncier than Ayton is now. Seriously, during his fist 2-3 seasons, before he really bulked up, he was the best, most versatile defensive 7-footer I have seen since KG, just an absolute force defensively.  Too bad we've never seen him play with someone who can actually pass in the PnR. He wouldn't need to bang nearly as much in the post, just catch lobs on the roll and splash open middies on the pop."
Embiid had a very similar injury earlier this season. Giannis knee extended further back though and he reacted way worse than Joel did.
"I'll wake up any minute now, this nightmare season is just a dream. Once I wake up, Simmons will be shooting 70% FT, playing well with Joel, with Embiid holding up the Finals MVP trophy. Any minute now.... right? Sorry, I'm still delusional."
"Embiid was in way better shape this year, but the last couple of injuries really took a toll. Joel is never going to be a 40 minute plus guy unless his game changes radically and he's suddenly a shooting guard, but we need him to be able to give maximum effort on both ends while he's out there."
or Joel Embiid saying I want to win 'really bad'
Nathan Knight has more points in conference finals than Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic combined

"* it's more fun to be a fan of a team that is consistently in the playoffs but not winning the final than it is to be a fan of a team that wins one and then disappears to the lottery  * giannis is a good player, but he's rated above where he should be and didn't deserve two mvps. his style of play is suited for the regular season but doesn't work in a playoff scenario where he needs to play more minutes and up his production every night. and when i say he's overrated i mean he's being ranked like a 90/100 instead of 85.   * AD isn't a top 10 player because a top 10 player would play the position that's best for his team and excel at it and dominate the league instead of doing what AD does. joel embiid is a top 10 player who does this."
It's really just the 4 all stars and maybe Clarkson depending on how you see him vs Wiggins. All 6 are also the 6 with the most career points scored in the draft.  Highest career scorers of the 2014 draft  Wiggins 10263 (525 games)  Nikola Jokic 8360 (453 games)  Jordan Clarkson 7950 (521 games)  Zach LaVine 7831 (411 games)  Julius Randle 7744 (446 games)  Joel Embiid 6456 (250 games)
"That bothered me so much.  I liked when Embiid cried in a way because it showed that he actually cared about winning for us.  That’s exactly what you want as a fan, you want the players to care and that is why we love Joel.  Ben didn’t even look like he cared and I’m not sure how much he did."
Only place the 76ers fan base is the best at fr. Joel Embiid could advocate for mandatory cheese bans and every Philadelphian would have to have a real conversation with themselves.
"Also, comparing making it with Embiid vs not w Zion isn't really telling. Joel is 27 Zion is 20."
Joel Embiid. For obvious reasons.
Joel Embiid doesn’t have the heart and grit to be a championship winning player.
Embiid has been on him to shoot [for years](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/sixers-joel-embiid-wants-ben-simmons-to-shoot-jumpers-more-often-hes-got-to-keep-on-taking-them/) but if anything Simmons shoots less than he did when he entered the league.
Donovan Mitchell -- No.  Zion Williamson -- No.  Luka Doncic -- Yes.  Nikola Jokic -- Yes.  Joel Embiid -- No.
"You can't convince me no one has tried any of that in wanting Ben to improve his offense. Not to mention, shit like that has to come from you before anyone else in the first place   Only reason should be is if he doesn't care enough and that's enough to give up on him and get Embiid help but since he's been saying that he'll work on it I guess we'll find out if another season of Joel will be wasted by Ben."
Donovan Mitchell: No  Zion Williamson: No  Luka Doncic: No  Nikola Jokic: Yes  Joel Embiid: No
"Joel Embiid was a guy I never liked. I remember he used to troll on twitter then miss 10 games because he’s sore. If you’re gonna talk trash on the internet, you gotta back it up on the court."
How does LeBron have a case over Joel Embiid? LOL
Ppl still dont see Lowry this way and yet Lowry is willing to take a charge from Joel Embiid bulldozing his way to the rim.
Joel Embiid unlocked his true form. So did Jokic.
You are right. I updated the stats here. He is in a different tier than Joel Embiid.  It's sad that Jokic has to beat LeBron and AD though to get to the NBA Finals. Very hard to beat the best!
"I guess I would ask first: What do you want to see out of Luka?     My first two go-tos were an aging LeBron, or current Durant. Both are so skilled on offense that they have the luxury of looking at their team on the floor, and just filling in the gaps seemingly effortlessly. (The transformation of Harden's game since moving to Brooklyn makes me want to throw him in here too, but I didn't, whatever) I say an aging LeBron here because in his PRIME prime, you'd be either wasting him or Luka a little bit because of how ball dominant both of them should be, but a LeBron in his later 30's, looking to save a little mileage and still 90-95% as good as he ever was? That's a wrap.     Next are the big men partners: AD or Embiid would be amazing. Both fierce rim-protectors, both able to score at will down low, both comfortable with midrange shots, AD has the edge over Joel at shooting 3's, but if both are healthy and trying their hardest, that's about the only edge I'd give Davis. Giannis would be an incredible partner, too, but I leave him third in here due to long range shooting. Pair Luka with any of these guys, and you have something potentially better than a Stockton/Malone combo, and that shit was amazing.     For guards, I'm thinking of someone where Luka CAN be the main guy, but doesn't always have to be. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson come to mind. Both of them have no problem not bringing the ball up and initiating the offense, but instead running all over the court through a million picks and setting screens for their teammates. This opens up so much for Doncic with the opposing teams terrified of his marksman teammates, and having to settle into something like a zone defense, or at least strongly discouraging opposing defenses from doubling too often. Also into this group I'd toss Kyrie, who is at his best, IMO, when there's a second option as good or better than him. As a wild card, I'll throw in Ja Morant, just because I'd love to watch it."
There are players who are good defenders but they just never exert their effort on that side until like late game situations or when their offense is not going like Russell Westbrook in his prime man was a top 10 defender in the league but only did in late games cause he had such a heavy offensive load   Kawhi it’s well known with him   Joel Embiid yea he’s playing like it this year but years before he didn’t exert that much energy in it   Lebron pretty well known   There’s just a lot of elite defensive players who only get called good defenders or above average but they just don’t try cause of there offensive load
"I think the 76ers would prefer to play Boston, because Joel Embiid has a tendency to feast against us. None of our C's match up well against him, and people always mention 'stopping,' Embiid, but you can't really stop him, more like slow him down.  I do think I'd rather have the Bucks or the Hawks, but I'm not gonna pretend to act like the Heat/76ers don't scare me.  Embiid/Simmons has been on a tear/bench way ahead of last year's, and the Heat have been struggling, but they're a team that potentially could be a dark horse contender like last year. (I'm not counting out Jimmy McBuckets or Bam, 'I'll-Block-The-Game-Winning-Dunk' Adebayo."
"That was the first season Brett Brown, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and 80% of our roster ever played in the playoffs. I don’t put much stock in that playoff run other than we were a young team that got humble. The next year we lost to the champs on a game winner in game 7. Then last year was a joke of a roster put together. We were garbage in the regular season and missed our second best player in the playoffs, not to mention a coach that completely lost the confidence of his team. The only series we’ve lost that we were even favored in was that first year and the lack of experience killed us.    The lack of playoff experience doesn’t apply to us anymore."
"So how likely is it that Joel Embiid takes MVP if he continues to go on a tear, win every game, and doesn’t miss any games?"

To suggest a quick return to play and a condensed schedule has had no effect on the NBA product or the health and safety of the NBA's marquee athletes is willful ignorance."
"Sixers/Jazz was also a very informative game about both teams. The Jazz ended up losing, but nobody can say they weren’t dominant and smothering. But then of course the sixers came back with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid dominating on offense, and Ben Simmons erasing Mitchell down the stretch."
"&gt;joel put up 30/10 easily  There was nothing easy about it. Embiid kept gassing out in the 2nd half and falling apart.  That's the point, Embiid is great but he can't do everything himself and the other guys are a joke.   This will be Simmons's 3rd playoffs where he gets the ball taken out of his hands. Tobias will be trying to break 16ppg in the playoffs for the first time in his career.  You guys should have traded for Eric Bledsoe to complete the trifecta of biggest playoff chokers."
"It was so wierd. People here thought that he was peaking at age 23.  Though to be fair people here have absurd expectations for certain teams. Like Joel will get swept in the first round and people will say that he will be better next year, but it’s absolutely blasphemous to suggest that perhaps Giannis or tatum, who are not on the clock that embiid is on, might improve upon their previous results (that are a lot more impressive than embiids)."
"He still can't shoot 3s or hit free throws, can't guard out to the perimeter.  Joel Embiid would dominate pre-steroid wilt. No big other than Shaq would change the way the modern game is played."
"I dont think its that close, any time and I mean anytime there is a Joel Embiid thread, there are a half dozen or so Nuggets fans just bringing up Jokic for no reason.  It gets tiring and Sixers fans are gonna fire back after awhile.  Jokic is playing great, so is JoJo; I want JoJo to win an MVP, I'd prefer a FMVP but who knows what will happen in the playoffs."
"I’m not sure how you have randle so high. The mavs have been better and luka is better, yet he’s below him. Lebron is too high as well. I would still have embiid above harden. Joel has missed games but harden has too, not to mention the whole Houston thing. I’m also not sure how Zion or Westbrook made it on this list. They’ve been great but their teams are 11th and 12th in their respective conferences."
"It was literally even with the narrative in favor of Lebron and Embiid. Joel missed 1/3 of the season, Lebrons out, Hardens out. It’s a wrap. Goatic for mvp"
Jimmy would be pretty old by the end of the threepeat and I don’t see his game aging too well. Joel is injury prone to the point where I wouldn’t trust him to be healthy for one of the runs. It’s be possible but only due to health.   They also lack a bit of size other than Embiid which may cause unfavorable matchups.   They’d be the favorites most years but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone beat this hypothetical team with the right matchups and less talent.
"Calling it a lucky bounce while ignoring the entire series where he averaged 35 on your ass while embiid couldn’t break 20 unless he got 10 free throws is hilarious. And kawhi is never in the mvp conversation. It’s cool that Joel is in the conversation now that he figured out how to get 12 FTs a game, but when refs swallow their whistle in the playoffs they’ll probably get swept by the nets so keep it real with yourself lol"
"not to take anything away from Joel, but that to me shows just how good Giannis was last season. Got him beat in every mark, and that’s with Embiid DOMINATING the game this year. just wow."
Joel Embiid is the NBA MVP
I’d rather have Joel on my team in the playoffs than Jokic.   Embiid in the post can not be stopped right now
"FG percentage is largely useless in this case due to different eras, play styles, and difference in 3pt attempts between the two players. IMO it shouldn't be considered at all but if you got into in, true shooting metrics would heavily favor Joel.   Per 100 possessions in 89-90, Dream was 30/17.5/3.6 while this year Joel is 44/16.5/4.5. Joel gets crushed in blocks but he has a huge edge in scoring.   And I realize I said healthy Joel... I know being on the court is important and counts towards your legacy. He won't approach Dream's career accomplishments or legacy. But I do think when Embiid is healthy he's right there talent wise now."

"Bro the Sixers just played Embiid 36 minutes against the Clippers because that is what was required. Like I said Doc plays his bench heavy minutes together and doesn't want any player playing a ton of minutes in the regular season if he can help it. Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris both average 33.3 mpg, Joel averages 32 with Howard playing basically all of his backup minutes when he's out there.   Again, that's just how the coach normally wants things to go, sometimes it's fewer and he plays 26-29 sometimes he plays 35-40. Just depends on the game. And obviously the playoffs they will play more as rotations shrink.   Jokic playstyle allows him to play heavy minutes, heavy games and not be at risk for injury. That's great, but Embiid plays pretty normal minutes for a 7'0"" 270lb center who is asked to do so much on both ends."
"I'm not talking about defensive schemes. Joel Embiid legit fucking hates Drummond and basically sees red whenever they play each other. What's more Embiid gets to Drummond like no other player so as another user mentioned below, Drummond will foul out within 10 minutes or pick up 2 techs in the same amount of time. It's honestly baffling to watch how much Embiid absolutely wrecks the man"
Joel has shot 43.5% against Rudy total. Just cause he was like 7/7 against Favors last time they played doesn’t mean Rudy isn’t a good Embiid defender.
If you throw Andre Drummond at Joel Embiid you will lose by 1000
To be honest man I don’t follow the NBA to closely so don’t take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he’s my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that’s why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
I have lost 8 less games this year than Joel Embiid. I am not saying he doesnt deserve MVP but I have a problem with the voters if they vote him mvp over me!
"Be me, an NBA player with the ball   By some miracle of God, I am able to get past Ben Simmons  Dribbling for my life, fortune favors me as I somehow pass Thybulle  I swoop pass Harris by the skin of my teeth and enter the hole.   My Reward for thrice defying death?  The approaching shadow of Joel Embiid, blotting out the sun."
"Tim Bontemps: [Ben Simmons says he thinks Joel Embiid is ""clearly"" the NBA's Most Valuable Player this season.s=21](https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1383242549121355785?s=21)  Tim MacMahon: [Did you call him a jackass? ](https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1383242696060329987?s=21)  Tim Bontemps: [No, he had a coherent argument.](https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1383242880437735432?s=21)"
Hot take - healthy Embiid this season is as good as Hakeem ever was. Obviously I realize Joel will not come close to some over the career accomplishments of the Dream due to lacking games played but his peak right now is just as high.
"It sounds like you don't want to hear anything that could potentially be negative towards the sixers. Joel Embiid is the greatest center of all time, Tobias Harris is the most clutch player of the decade, and Ben Simmons will have a complete offensive arsenal come playoff time. Hope you can hop off reddit in peace now"
Joel Embiid = better
"Joel Embiid is a 7'3"" center with dribble moves, a Dirk like midrange game, and an impressive post game. He's going to draw far more fouls than Zubic. And if you don't understand that I don't know what else to say."
"No cause I think 135 points a game will slow Joel Embiid down just fine. In all seriousness there's only like 3-4 guys who have both the strength and discipline to guard him and those are probably and Gasol, JV, Jokic. Kanter also does pretty well against embiid by making him work on defense with his offensive rebounding"
God damn Joel embiid is a monster. How do you even game plan against that. You literally have to foul him.
"There is no embiid stopper. Dealing with Philly comes down to what we do against Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny green, Ben Simmons etc. Joel can do whatever he wants as long as we do well against everyone else, they are not beating us"
Curious to see what the 76ers will do in the post season if Joel Embiid doesn't shoot 15ft's a game
Counterpoint: Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid is the best center in the league
So do I. His name is Joel Embiid and he did that tonight. Thanks for noticing!
joel embiid
"He straight up barely talks about us. I think he used to be as a kid but he’s said he considers himself a New Yorker even tho he lives in Connecticut.  He definitely became a huge Philly fan after the Process because last season he would not stop talking about them and even interviewed Joel Embiid on his podcast this week.  Then, he loves those 99 Knicks like Bill. I feel like he’s secretly waiting for the Knicks to get good and that’s really his team but I don’t know for sure.  I do know he always glosses over us whenever he gets a chance, it’s not negative, it’s just that he skips over us. Maybe it’s to balance out Bill from his days with him back then? I’m not sure."
Joel Embiid is also very close. Averaging 29.8 points per game on 64.2 TS%
I can see why Jokic will be MVP (Joel missed a lot of games) but watching Embiid play his dominance on both ends is unmatched. When he plays nobody is better currently.
Joel Embiid is a bucket
"He played in 76% of games last season and was healthy for 86% of the games last season.   He's played in around 66% of games this year and will most likely hit around 70+% by the season is over.   He's not the epitome of health, but it gets really overblown. Last season he played the same amount of games as Kawhi Leonard, and more games than Joel Embiid. He was only 5 games less than Anthony Davis and Nikola Vucevic.   The same folks that hate on him in /r/mavericks are the same so-called therapists and body language experts who are analyizing his body language and claiming that because he didn't go make out with Luka after his game-winner that he was somehow upset that he didn't get the last second shot and is a cancer to the team."
"I mean, Joel has played better basketball both offensively and defensively than Jokic.  But people like simple volume numbers. In a league where playing a large volume of regular season games is pointless.   I think it’s pretty simple, if you’re in the finals and had to pick one of the two to play for your team 95% of people would want Embiid"
I have no problem as a Sixers fan admitting Jokic is the clear-cut MVP in this moment. But Nuggets fans really need to start arguing their case without mentioning the name 'Joel Embiid'.
"Spurs fans fuckin hate Richard Jefferson lol  In the exact same vein, Sixers fans hate Al Horford. He made Joel Embiid unhappy so it’s justified"
Never the betting favorite?   https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp
"Not if his team wins less with him playing. Embiid has only 6 fewer wins than Jokic despite playing 18 fewer games. The sixers also have a .500 record without him. Without Joel, we would have a far worse record than the Nuggs, but with him, we have a fairly significantly better record"
"&gt; That was the point he was making with the Joel/Brogdan rookie season. Brogdan had a great rookie year, but it was clear that the best rookie was Joel. It’s not that he doesn’t understand Mvp voting, it’s that he’s hates the lacking of nuance in the voting which is a thing. The gap shouldn’t be THAT wide.   If people don't agree with the way either Windy or yourself think people should vote, that's not a lack of nuance, that's just yourself having a different opinion. It doesn't make it more or less valid, but doesn't mean it lacks nuance.   And the gap between voting doesn't matter if every single voter thinks that the number 1 candidate is better by a miniscule margin, that candidate should get an unanimous mvp. It's not about the margin, but about the consensus.   And Embiid didn't miss just 10 games, that was a very shady argument by Windy, he missed 18. He should win the season award if he can compensate those missed with his production vs the other candidates, the majority of people think he won't do that.  &gt; Which was his point about Steph being so low with his number and how in 30 years we’ll look at those crazy efficient numbers and be like “12th!? Fucking idiots”.  There are only 3 votes that are given, the MVP results are only representative for those 3 places, after that it's just statistical noise and shouldn't be looked at."
"Joel is who Joel is. I just think Jokic is better, and that's a subjective opinion I have. Jokic is the polar opposite of who embiid is as a person and as a player. It makes sense it creates animosity between the two fanbases (see the animosity between the introvert Messi and brash &amp; Proud Ronaldo)."
"To quote Vernon maxwell, “if I knew you jazz fans had internet I wouldn’t have posted that”  what kind of whack ass bait is this lmao. You guys really care that much that an player opposing urs for an award thinks he deserves it? Ur mad that Ben Simmons and Joel embiid aren’t reading ur on/off stats and admitting publically that gobert is clearly superior? Even clicking this article once would reveal that embiid is using this more as self motivation than bragging"
Literally every year before the playoffs embiid posts his predictions via photos on instagram.... And always comes up short. Lol. I get why sixers fans would be offended but OP is right. Joel embiid is constantly hyping himself up instead of letting other people do it for him. He's proclaimed he's the most dominant player in the league on multiple occasions which is just not true at all seeing as how he gets dominated by injuries and general fatigue every year lol
"Jojo has missed some games with injury yes and jokic has been more consistent but embiid is the better overall player and has a better plus minus, with higher usage. Jokic barely even plays defense. If a center is gonna win mvp is like to see them do what centers do best, protect the rim. I know this is unpopular but imo unless your name is Steph curry and you’re having a historically great offensive season(which Joel is btw) you gotta play defense. Jo was the unanimous pick before his injury and will end up playing 65%+ of the games anyway. He’s played like an mvp for the best team in his division. Just crazy to me that the best two way season ever isn’t gonna win mvp cuz he got injured."
"&gt; and just as if not more capable of a scorer than embiid.  Don't know about that lol. His shooting numbers from 3 have been consistently a tick higher than Embiid, but historically and this season specifically Embiid is more efficient outside 10 feet to the 3 point line. Joel is a volume scorer while I assume Jokic tends to focus more on facilitating. But in a season where Jokic has played so much more, they have the same number of games scoring 40 or more, Joel has more games scoring 30 or more, and it's about even for 25 or more.  I think the biggest difference is Joel's ability to get to the FT line, which is like more than double Jokic's number. I think the overall offensive impact is on the side of Jokic but Embiid is a better scorer for me, it makes sense their best at their respective jobs for the team"
"&gt; Did you just compare embiid impact on offense to Jokic?   I mean Joel has almost 30 ppg and is almost always doubled team which creates a lot of space for our shooters. So why wouldn't you mention and compare impacts on offense? Saying ""it's not even close"" is just plain stupid."
 Embiid is listed at +200    James at +225.    Jokic +350     That is HARDLY overwhelming.  [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31038407/joel-embiid-overtakes-lebron-james-favorite-win-mvp)
"Just a small nitpick, it's not really a tiebreaker it's the reason that Jokic is leading. Before he got hurt Embiid was the overwhelming favorite, and Jokic has continued his play and the Nuggets have stayed around the same middle seeds since. The reason is the missed games for Embiid, not anything else.   So it's not really a tiebreaker so much as a main reason for Jokic being the frontrunner right now. Probably as overwhelming a favorite as Joel was before he got hurt.   And it's 100% fair to give it to Jokic on this basis. Added to the fact that he is having a legitimate MVP season."
"It was extremely clear. Most of the publications I saw had embiid at the top spot. When joel went down the nuggets were like 20-15, not even in the top 4. Jokic's numbers are nice but it wasn't winning basketball."
"I know you don't want to hear this but hear me out. Games played? Fair enough, that is important and Jokic availability is a plus but that is also a lot of luck/unluck. But it matters? Of course, no one is saying that it doesn't. But if you actually watch Sixers games you understand that Joel creates a much bigger impact when he is on the floor and can put a game away real quick. In a lot of games he went out there for 25/26 minutes and put up 34/35/36 with just straight up dominance on both ends. And then he sits. I just think that Curry would win it no discussion if their seed wasn't that horrible but that's a product of their G league team. But after Curry the most impactful and the better player this season is Embiid no discussion. And Embiid doesn't have the seed problem. So I would give it to him."
*Joel Embiid in shambles*
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
That’s a sick one   The question should be who are the worst two players you could combine and make a top 10 player   Because this is basically Joel embiid with a better 3 pt shot
"Joel Embiid and James Harden  Size and skill of Embiid, durability, shooting, and beard of James. This is the GOAT player easily"
"Ty man, I appreciate that. I am worried about Joel Embiid, but he admitted that he eats whole jars of nutella with his bare hands so im not worried.   Im hoping we can just stay healthy, no more of our guys catch covid, we get Fournier back and just get into a rhythm. I honestly dont expect much from this season though."
"So uh, Joel Embiid averaging 30/11/3 on 64 TS% while leading his team to the 1st seed currently isn't a top 10 player?"
"He was my MVP frontrunner right from the start of the season. It's kinda sad it took others getting injured for people to notice he isn't just the 2nd or 3rd option for MVP. The Nuggets without him are much worse than the Sixers without Embiid and Jokic does even more for their team when on the floor. Not a knock on Joel, I just think that this MVP belonged to Jokic since the start."
"Nobody, because Jokic is an average+ NBA defender overall. He allows fewer FG within 6ft than Embiid does (obviously at a higher percentage). He allows the 3rd fewest points per possession vs the PnR among NBA bigs, behind only Turner and Gobert. He’s one of the best big men for generating steals and deflections, the former of which are more valuable than blocks. Joel is shooting 9/29 against him in his career lmao. WNBA guard for sure.    Jokic’s rim protection (DFG% within 6ft) is bad for a starting NBA center but is in line with the rim protection numbers of many good defensive PFs, like AD for example. A playable NBA center still has real value, otherwise guys like Bismack Biyombo wouldn’t be in the league. Jokic is *clearly* playable, and above average for people who actually watch him or look at data."
&gt; Joel Embiid taking threes would break brains.  Embiid taking a shot that didn't exist yet would break their brains yh.
"Joel Embiid taking threes would break brains. Once they realize centers need to close out on him— thus now allowing him to pump and drive— the league would probably shut down for a few days to figure out how to change some rules to make it a fair game. He’d be unstoppable, if a coach didn’t yank him off the floor for flinging jumpers first."
Aldridge wanted no smoke with Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid and Stephen Curry
&gt; Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis:  are you Elton Brand's burner
"Damn raptor fans are gonna start posting rebounds as highlights too  I mean this is really impressive, but we don’t post Rudy Gobert’s picks or Joel Embiid sealing his man in transition lol"
Joel Embiid is more efficient at all ranges than prime rose. He’s also a top tier defender at the most important defensive exposition in the league.   This year Embiid would **easily** win the 2012 MVP over Rose (and i like rose a ton!)
"&gt;""if i get the ball its either a bucket or a foul, or if i decide to miss the shot"".  Joel ""Rock Lee"" Embiid"
"*whistles*  ""2 free throws for Joel Embiid"""
"Good thing we have the closest thing to Hercules, Joel Embiid baby"
MVP Convo  *Joel Embiid has re-entered the thread*
This Joel Embiid is pretty good at basketball
"Because of Joel Embiid, as we saw Ben get blown by multiple times and Joel stop Kyrie."
Yeah you aren’t doing it for defense the foul problem stuff is definitely true though   Real question is whom do you put as your 5th guy if BKN with those 3 and Joe Harris. Pretend to still care about defense with like Bruce brown or just say fuck this and put in Landry Shamet and go all in on offense and spacing. Think at that point I would probably do the latter. Dont give Joel Embiid a natural matchup defensively
He is Joel Embiid. He takes whatever shots he can and you can't question it lol
Laugh now but if they play in the playoffs 100% you will see small ball Durant at the 5 lineups where James Harden guards Joel Embiid.
"&gt; Deandre ayton is someone I feel is near plateauing and he’s gonna be a low end of a high grade important player, but initially I thought he’d be a star  Deandre Ayton put up 20/11 on 65% TS in college which is the best 1 and done production for a center I have ever seen and is more productive than Joel Embiid, Greg Oden, and KAT for example. Even the critics of the Ayton pick thought he would still put up David Robinson or Patrick Ewing production but ""that type of player isn't as beneficial in the modern NBA"" and his defense will hold him back. I know the Suns are doing well, spread the scoring around, and play at a slow pace, but no one thought he would be putting up 15 ppg in his 3rd year."
"""and DeAndre Jordan is back in it to counter Joel Embiid"" yo that might be one of the funniest sentences ive ever seen in this sub lmao"
“Deandre ur the Embiid counter now”  “K”  “Joel pls stop”
"no wonder why lebron increased a lot his 3pt attempts.  Butler and Giannis get a lot of calls but they also go strong at the rim. Very surprised to see George up there, or KD.  Kyrie as always tries to avoid contacts. He's so good at making layups trying his best to score without forcing contact with the defender. That's why he never had many ft attempts.  Other players instead are just good at pointing the defender and wait for a mistake creating the contact, so Harden or Trae and Embiid too, but Joel is also used to go strong and he's so big you can't do much to stop him.  Don't hate the player, hate the game."
"He's been quiet for a little bit now, but I would give that honor to Joel Embiid. Dude is a wonderful troll."
Best league ever  1 - Anthony Davis + LeBron James  2 - Giannis Antetokounmpo + Luka Doncic  3 - Joel Embiid + James Harden  4 - Nikola Jokic + Kawhi Leonard  5 - Kevin Durant + Steph Curry  6 - Rudy Gobert + Jimmy Butler + Damian Lilard  7 - Bam Adebayo + Paul George + Kyrie Irving  8 - Karl Anthony Towns + Jayson Tatum + Ben Simmons  9 - Draymond Green + Devin Booker + Chris Paul  10 - Kristaps Porzingis + Zion Williamson + Donovan Mitchell  11 - Clint Capela + Jaylen Brown + Bradley Beal
"if he is that cocky without any ring or accolade, i for sure dont want him to get a DPOY. Also come on , you defensive second line is Joel Embiid, a mvp candidate and top defender."
"In 2 games without Damian Lillard, the Blazers are 2-0 in those games. One of them is againsts 76ers which has healthy Joel Embiid on the court."
"Gobert was the primary defender on Simmons that game against Utah, Joel Embiid was not playing.  The jazz decided to not double Ben and let Gobert take him 1 on 1 with no help.  Let's just say the next time they faced the Sixers the Jazz decided to double team Ben when he got to the lane."
'Embiid of Joel'
"I don’t think he would be top 5. Dirk would get annihilated on defense. As for top 5 players better than him; Old man Lebron I would put past him, healthy AD has actual defense, Giannis is still a demon on both offense and defense, KD still exists as a better version of Dirk, Jokic is leagues better playmaker and can almost score at will, Joel Embiid is arguably a DPOY and MVP candidate. I can’t put Dirk up there and that’s only considering front court. Back court players: (Curry, Harden, Ramadan Kyrie, Beal, Beastbrook, etc. ) aren’t even considered"
"Do bad unexpected performances count? Because Joel Embiid 0 points has to be up there, that was way too unexpected"
Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic are laughing at your love of Bradley Beal right now.
I’m just glad both of them are on my team. Imagine Harden with Joel Embiid in Philly? I thank god everyday for Tillman’s pettiness towards Daryl Morry. Don’t got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
"I agree, I don’t think they are at all. They want him to be Tim Duncan more than Joel Embiid, playing consistent mistake-free basketball rather than high scoring... but the thing that made Tim so great was his ability to take his game to the next level when he had to. He had one of the best post up games of all time and was a reliable go to bucket when the Spurs needed it. Ayton has shown very real flashes of being a top tier post up player, but we are only giving him an absolute fraction of the post up touches he deserves, so his game really isn’t developing there to go from well above average to great."
Knicks make it out of the East like bubble heat did. Also Joel Embiid is never going to win an mvp in an 82-Game season
Joel Embiid for crying after a tough playoff loss.
Ben Wallace = Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid having 0 GP through his first two seasons was a troubling stat lol
"Yeah, I mean the only player in the 2018 draft that will be better than MPJ is Luka (who was also a generational type prospect, to most teams at least), who's been playing professional basketball since he was like 15 lol  I can understand if a team is picking in the top few spots of the draft that they might not want to have their guy sit out the entire first year, but the fact he slipped all the way to 13 is pretty mind boggling. The surgeon who performed his back surgery said he wasn't at much of a risk for re-injury and that his career should be relatively unaffected by it long term. I think his injury was far less concerning than, say, Joel Embiid - who still went 3rd overall.  It all worked out though, at least he's not stuck on the Kings or Cavs or something lmao"
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That’s 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
*Looks at every team around the league dealing with unprecedented levels of injuries*  Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are not durable
"His first two years weren't too far off from AD's. His 3rd year is about the same age as Joel Embiid's rookie year. Ayton was supposed to take a leap this year and prove he is the same caliber of player as Embiid as he matches his age when he started. He hasn't done that. Ayton was the 20/11 65 TS% guy in college, not Embiid and not KAT. Yes, he is on a very good balanced team and not first or second option, and yes he is on one of the slowest paced teams in the league but nobody saw this coming and even bigtime critics of the Ayton pick thought he would likely put up David Robinson or Patrick Ewing type production but that type of player isn't as valuable in today's NBA. I think there is a chance Ayton produces similar production to a young Al Horford as far as scoring in the teens and good defense but not MVP or DPOTY candidate. I do think he could score 20+ ppg with great rebounding and great switchable defense too though. Don't know if he ever gets you top 4, now that there has been a center resurgence compared to the late 2000's and early 2010's."
I know your not talking about Joel Part-Time Embiid and Ben I can't make a fucking shot Simmons
Especially with Joel Part-Time Embiid
Exactly! I don't think people appreciate just how good an actual contender's bench is. Look at all the Lakers have been able to accomplish without LeBron and AD. Or when Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons sit for Philly. We've seen what happens when Steph and Draymond are out. This team is hardly functional. Sure Steph is getting older but he can't win without a great bench and role players around him. It takes time to make a good bench and get them on the same page. Why not develop Wiseman during that time?
Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid easy
Joel Embiid
"Eh, Jokic, Giannis and Joel Embiid are better."
Either try to run it back or trade anyone who isn’t named Joel Embiid
"Pretty horrible start to the game, considering Philly had Embiid and Simmons out. That being said, not really taking too much away from this game. Philly poses problems for the Bucks with their bench (tall athletic guards) so while it is always nice to beat the 76ers ; it’s a different team with Joel and Ben.  Gg either way."
The Joel Embiid Flu
"Is the rest of your team that bad? Damn, good thing Joel Embiid is always available"
"Dame, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid"
"Shaq’s criticism of players, particularly big men, usually comes from his narrow minded view of how he thinks they should play. Basically if they don’t follow HIS formula, (30 pts, 15 reb or whatever arbitrary numbers he comes up with), they can’t be great.   With Embiid, however, his criticisms are actually valid because he’s probably the closest thing to Shaq we’ve  ever seen in terms of being able to physically dominate the game. Joel has so many more facets to his game, and Shaq has even admitted on live TV he believes Joel is more talented/skilled."
"&gt;Joel Embiid is playing out of his mind right now and I don't expect that to keep up. He was a career 41.8% shooter from 10-16 feet and 38.7% shooter from 16 feet &gt; 3PT prior to this season but is shooting 56.0% and 62.5% respectively from those areas this season on similar volume. Similarly, he was a career 31.9% three-point shooter and is up to 37.7% this season. Tobias Harris is overperforming as well, although to a lesser extent.  Lol that's kinda like how AD was shooting unsustainably hot in the bubble, I still believe it's a product of no fans and it'll continue for a period."
"Embiid would have my vote right now but I always find it absurd when someone gets compared to LeBron and the only thing that is brought up is scoring and defense and we just completely ignore that LeBron is the best passer in the league.   LeBron also played a bit better in the H2H so I don't think that is going to sway anyone.   Right now I would vote for Embiid but I'd bet on LeBron because I think of the two, Embiid's numbers and team record are more likely to regress. It's a crazy year and Bron/Joel/Jokic are all crazy close as of now."
"It’s not even low key, I would die for Joel Embiid but Dame is the best the league has to offer in terms of all around personality"
"I can see 6ers doing this in a few nights. I expect our 3 point shooting to drop with their 1-4 staying commited to guarding the perimeter, and Rudy and the Conley/Rudy PnR is going to have to test their scoring against Joel embiid 1v1.  A very intriguing matchup for a variety of reasons.  I don’t like the matchup on paper if Conley is out, tbh"
This post made me currious on the FT% of the people that get to the line the most. For others curious:   Joel Embiid				86%  on 228 attempts 	 Giannis Antetokounmpo	62% on 224 attempts	  Trae Young				89% on 220 attempts	  Luka Dončić				79% on 193 attempts 	 Damian Lillard			94% on 170 attempts
Joel Embiid shooting 85% from the line is rigoddamnfuckingdiculous.
"If Joel Embiid starts picking up accolades like winning the MVP this year, getting a championship or two I think this guy has top 10-15 player of all time potential."
"I think if Lakers can take the 1st seed LeBron will probably win; to be playing at this level at this age is remarkable. Plus with Brady winning Super Bowl MVP it’s sort of fitting this year.   If the 76ers hold onto the 1st seed and the Lakers slip to 2nd, and Embiid doesn’t miss more than 25% of the games (he’s missed 20% so far) then he’ll probably win.  The only way Jokic can have a shot is if the Nuggets can reach a top 4, ideally top 3 seed, and also Lakers stay out of first and Philly drops out of first or Joel misses too many games.   Steph is kind of in the same boat as Jokic, just slightly less inspiring stats.  Kawhi, PG, or Giannis have a shot if they take 1st seed by a landslide.  Pretty sure no one on the Nets is in play, Mavs record is too bad for Doncic, Jazz are too team oriented for Gobert"
Joel Embiid
"Joel ""The Process"" Embiid"
"Yea sure, Embiid is mvp frontrunner rn, but  no one is mentioning that Philly without Joel is borderline playoff team, whilst Nuggets without Jokic would have worst record in west"
Counterpoint: Joel Embiid

"Bro every comment on Jokic doesn't have to turn into a Joel/Jokic pissing match. I said if Jokic is going to play the level of defense he plays then he needs better defenders at the 2,3, and 4.   I didn't bring up Joel but yes, he and Gobert could play good defense behind those players. Trust me Embiid played with some turnstiles at guard and still had a majorly positive impact on that end. Belineli, Redick, freaking Bayless' trash ass. But we were always a good defense with him on the court.   If you say Jokic is playing better on defense then I'll take your word for it, but a center has to be a difference maker on that end imo. Not just slightly below or above average. But again that's just my opinion, surprise, surprise, this sub agrees with you lol. But there's no need to bring Joel into this and turn this into the 1,000,000th Joel/Nikola debate."
Josh Hart with a Joel Embiid stat line! Zion with 20/5/7 in only 21 minutes thanks to the refs. 4 wins in a row baby!  ###[YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS !!!](https://youtu.be/3SQa48DcX1E)
He traded Embiid for Vucevic on the premise that Joel will go down at some point.  I think it's shrewd.
Joel Embiid better hide his kid and wife
Joel Embiid
Well you don't see articles regarding what Juancho Hernangomez cna bring to the Timberwolves after recovering from covid do you?  And there is a difference since Joel Embiid is a superstar who people do care about and him changing his conditioning can impact his entire team and with that the conference while this is just a post about an out of rotation player maybe coming into the rotation.
"What is the difference between this and ""Joel Embiid changed his offseason conditioning."" Do you just simply not want to see anything lakers related on r/nba? Don't click on it then."
"Joel, Lebrun, embiid, kd, kawhii, giannis all better so far this season."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"If you think Joel Embiid by himself is beating Harden, Kyrie, and KD... honey, you’ve got a big storm comin"
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
"Does KG see something in Willie Cauley-Stein that the rest of us don't? Or is he just saying, Willie Cauley-Stein could use some help?  &gt; **I know that since retiring, you’ve trained a few younger players. Who do you see now and think you could help his game?** A lot of big men. James Wiseman. Joel Embiid. Jokic. Willie Cauley-Stein. Marvin Bagley up in Sacramento"
"Moses Malone, Hal Greer, Wilt Chamberlain, Allen Iverson, Dr. J all had greater Sixers careers. Joel Embiid will be there too in no time, and some other guys like Mo Cheeks have arguments too."
Bububububububut Ben Simmons hurts SPACING you need to have SPACING to play Joel Embiid they should’ve traded Brick Simmons for D’Angelo Russell?!??!?!
2020-21 Joel Embiid.
"&gt;Let me tell you something, I haven't even begun to peak. And when I do peak, you'll know. Because I'm gonna peak so hard that everybody in Philadelphia's gonna feel it  -	Joel Embiid"
"Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Donovan Mitchell, Chris Paul, Zach LaVine, Zion Williamson"
It’s hard to say tbh the comp for KG to me from a physical perspective is al horford and horford was always able to hold up surprisingly well vs Embiid they could put him 1 v 1. Both were in that 240 lb range old man strength is a hell of a thing also    It’s weird though I can see what your saying he doesn’t have Bam’s physical strength and tbh bam can’t guard Joel Embiid they played tons of zone last year vs Philly and different things to minimize the time Bam directly spent 1 v 1 vs Embiid. Which is part of why I think it’s hard to say
PG- Nikola Jokic  SG- James Harden  SF- Kawhi Leonard  PF- Giannis  C- Joel Embiid
They need defense but they need jumpy rim defenders more than wing depth. RHJ isn’t stopping Joel Embiid or Nikola Vucevic
Joel Embiid is the best player in basketball because he's in better form? Was Giannis actually at any point a better basketball player than LeBron these past two years?
That’s a funny way to spell Joel Embiid as LeBron James
"Yet he has/had his career highs against Utah, Philly, Phoenix, and Boston, all teams with trash big men like Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid (2x), Deandre Ayton, Al Horford"
damn i mean i want us to sign him but not if he’s gonna bitch about playing behind joel fucking embiid lol   although he would get a decent amount of starts i think considering how much embiid rests
"Plus, the 76ers have a long ass window.  I really don't know how much I believe that they beat the nets in terms of what they offered.  Our problem right now is our shitty bench.  Trading all of our assets for Harden would have just made the problem worse... not just now... but for all of Joel's prime years.  Plus, Harden's window and Joel's don't really fit together.  The 76ers are in no rush.  It's not quite ""win now"" mode, because our two superstars are in their mid 20's.  If anything in like 3 years THAT will be the time where sixers would want to sell the farm for a superstar like Harden, who is on the later stages of his career.  If the 76ers did trade for Harden, you'd end up with Joel Embiid in his prime 2-3 years with an old ass Harden.  No reason to go all in, then the team is too asset poor to compete when we actually have the best shot of winning.  In the coming year or 2 I'm sure the 76ers will be able to attract talent."
"&gt; And then to go from winning ten games in a year to back to back 50+ win seasons should further prove that.  oh yes such merit bringing a team with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler to 50 wins.   Brett is a good guy but he was essentially a nanny, had 0 accountability established as said by JJ Redick, Jimmy Butler and others sixers and held back players like Simmons and Embiid from developing by being more a babysitter than a coach  And the thing many forget: he had a hand in creating the abomination that was the sixers 19/20 roster and didnt want to play Horford off the bench until it was extremely late in the season  He's so bad that literally no team wanted to sign him after so many seasons with the Sixers"
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
Sixers win in a blowout. Ben and Joel gonna score 25+ each again. This sub will overreact and call Embiid the MVP until we lose again then they’ll say he misses too many games and that it’s Lebron’s MVP to lose since he’s not getting any help from his team rn.
Joel Hans Embiid
Good he never deserved it this season over Joel Embiid anyway.
Did Joel Embiid die?
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"Joel Embiid was literally the next player below KAT on the raptor rating, that must mean he is not good enough to take a team to the playoffs."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
Joel Embiid would literally be the GOAT.
That was before Joel Embiid learned about Marc Gasol's existance
"From the [linked ESPN article](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28762854/giannis-antetokounmpo-continues-level-decisively-great), in the link above (Feb 23, 2020):  &gt;Just two nights earlier, Embiid [declared himself the ""best player in the world.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28747864/76ers-joel-embiid-dominant-declares-best-player-world)""  That was on Feb 21 after a 76ers win over the Nets.  So his later comment came as a response to Embiid not just feeling but also declaring himself the best player in the world."
"We played superb defense on them, yes. But the title of the post was “after Joel Embiid declared himself unguardable, the raptors held him to 25 points”. My point was if 25 points is a terrible game for him, he’s pretty unguardable"
"&gt; Embiid only being under contract for 3 more years only bolsters the argument to go all in whiles here because he could just as well up and leave after that.  Ok but you need to balance going all in with leaving yourself room to have a bench...Maxey, Shake, and Matisse all have some kind of value we can use for a trade but also offer us some rotation pieces that are effective on a small amount of money. That's a serious need for a team constructed like the sixers. You point to our playoff performance, but we would've won the Toronto series (especially game 7) with a real backup C to Joel. -12 in 2 minutes when Joel sat in the second half and that straight lost us the game. It's nice to have a superstar starting lineup but we ALREADY have 3 max players in our starting 5.  I know I'm closer to this team since I'm a fan, but the numbers back up a trend that has been true for 4 seasons now. Lineups with Joel + Ben are effective on offense and defense and are the lineups that will win us games. We've ALWAYS outscored opponents with those 2. Regular season and playoffs. We've struggled at having depth that can compete and at the moment I think that's a much larger concern.  Needing a high level perimeter scorer in the playoffs is a concern, but I don't think investing in a 35 year old Kyle Lowery is the best way to solve something that's going to be an issue next year and the year after as well. It's not about wanting to hold onto Maxey because in 5 years I think he'll be an All Star. I think there are better uses of assets, especially if the Raptors are going to ask for Maxey, Matisse, Scott, filler, + multiple picks"
what would they give up for lowry that toronto wants? joel embiid?
"It’s due mainly to differences in playstyle. When Embiid posts up, he does a lot of attacking downhill, where he’ll try to find the defender messing up. It usually results in a) defender has to foul because Embiid is too strong/fast or b) defender is a step behind and when they overcommit Joel looks for the foul.   Contrast it when jokic posts up, he’s either in the high post looking for a cutting teammate/orchestrating the offense or he shoots that patented one legger falling back, which makes it a lot harder to get fouled on than him just going up towards the basket."
"Can’t take it for granted how well Embiid is playing right now. There’s no evidence he can keep this level going for the rest of the season, let alone 3 years from now. Let’s now even assume what he’s like 6-7 years from now. The time is now to go all in, Lowry would at least give them a punchers chance against the Nets. You don’t scoff at adding a top ~35 player for a 19 year old kid that doesn’t project to be in a playoff rotation anytime soon.   Not even getting to Ben who has missed significant time in a few seasons. Lowry would take pressure off both Joel and Ben and hear them for a serious playoff run."
"I like the fact that Embiid doesn't shy away from huge goals or give PC answers. He's not worried about jinxes or bulletin board material. Most players won't even say there goal is to win a title (when that should be everyone's goal) because it puts too much ""pressure"" on the team, and Joel is over here saying he wants to win the championship get MVP and DPOY lol.   Giannis is perfectly justified in having his opinion though. Not every player has to be the same or treat media availability the same."
"Giannis is a 2x MVP and DPOY, Joel has never reached the ECF. Giannis is a Top 5-6 player in the league Joel isn't, Joel is having a better season than Giannis if you call someone averaging 28/12/6 bad lmao. Embiid isn't on Giannis' level and still has a lot to prove before he gets there"
"If we are looking at projecting out for the rest of the season, the entirety of his nba career (where he's been extremely consistent with very little variance statistically) is probably a better indictor than a 10 game streak that is being buoyed by a single 42 point outing where Joel Embiid didn't play"

Joel Embiid  Kawhi Leonard  Lu Dort  Marcus Smart  Ben Simmons
"Yeah I don’t want 80s basketball, but I know Simmons is at best a top 20 player while Magic is an MVP. He’s played with 2 legit stars/superstars in Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid and they carried him in the playoffs."
"Starters: KD, Kyrie, Beal, Giannis, Embiid  Reserves locks: Harden  so that leaves 1 more guard, 3 frontcourt, two wild cards  Guard possibilities - Jaylen, Trae, Lavine, FVV, Jrue  Frontcourt possiblities - Tatum, Vucevic, Grant, Randle, Hayward, Middleton, Bam, Tobias  From the frontcourt I can only see Tatum and maybe Randle over Vucevic. None of Grant, Gordon, Middleton, Bam or Tobias are better or having better seasons than him  It would be a travesty if Vuc doesnt make it. Hes the 3rd or 4th best center is the league depending on how you see him VS Rudy. Only Jokic and Joel are clearly ahead"
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12.

"Idk where you’re getting your numbers from, but he’s been shooting significantly more in the paint this season. Yes 80% was made up number, but still the vast majority of his shots take place in the paint(the paint is 19 feet from foul line to base line) even if they are jumpers.  Just look here to see how often he shoots in the paint: https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/joel-embiid-shot-chart-by-season  I’m not here to say Embiid doesn’t embellish contact or use his quickness to catch players out of position to draw fouls, but literally every NBA great does that, and is totally different from jumping into someone on a 3point attempt. Heck they had to change a rule bc Harden was abusing it so much to get to the line."
"I’m talking about the double standard. Joel shoots like shoot but finishes with a lot of points because of free throws: “cool he still had 25”. Harden shoots like shit but finishes with a lot of points because of free throws: “foul baiting bum”   They both hunt for fouls. They are the two biggest baiters in the league.   And also:   Embiid % of shots by distance:   0-3 ft: 21%   3-10 ft: 23.1%   10-16 ft: 23.4%   16ft-3P: 16.1%   3P: 16.4%   He does not take 80% of his shots in the paint. Like, not even close lmao."
"1) Harden (first option offensive juggernaut)  2) Joel Embiid (defensive anchor and reliable second option)   3) Jordan Clarkson (elite bench scorer)  That’ll guarantee the Raps win the next three chips, no doubt."
Dwight Howard is better than Joel Embiid. Just compare their careers.
Well Joel Embiid should’ve been the unanimous MVP after lebron lost to the heat yesterday according to 76ers fans
"[Doc Rivers said Joel Embiid told him as they walked off the floor, “I had a hundred good looks, they just weren’t going in.”](https://twitter.com/jackfrank_jjf/status/1363680807286501378)"
According to r/nba standards Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid along with LeBron James have all fell out of the MVP race !
"You know what I think he is right. It doesn't matter that Joel Embiid has been averaging 30 points over 25 games. Chris Boucher and Baynes ""clamped"" him up today so they must be better right? If I was the 76ers, I would trade Joel and a couple of first round picks for the Better Centers Chris Boucher and Baynes. It's time to break that team up.  &amp;#x200B;  Chris Boucher for MVP"
Joel Embiid averages over 30 PPG
Is this like what the 2nd game this year that Ben Simmons has been better than Joel Embiid?

I skipped a bunch and also left out some duplicates for players."
"There two options  A. Joel Embiid, who is an average mid range shooter over his career, is about to have the best mid range shooting season ever, or  B. This is unsustainable"
1. Joel Embiid  2. Nikola Jokic  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Stephen Curry  5. LeBron James/Kevin Durant
"Hell no. People seem to think this will revive the skilled low post player making moves to score. It will not  It will empower tall, strong players who can establish position in the paint but don't need to be able to do anything else. Why post from the block and make a move when you can just stand in the lane?   Joel Embiid isn't fun because he can seal his man and score sometimes, there's a lot more to him and every other big man scorer  It would immediately end any kind of small ball variability, or any of the fun lineup and stylistic variations we have today. Instead every team would be clogging the lane with immovable objects and trying to get the ball to them"
Also if this doesn’t come with the removal of defensive 3 seconds. Joel Embiid will win MVP every year for the rest of his career

"I’ve got no dog in this fight, but I think saying that Jokic is “clearly” having the better season is extremely disingenuous. Embiid matters to the Sixers just as much, if not more than Jokic matters to the Nuggets. They’re nothing when Joel isn’t on the floor. He’s putting up ridiculous stats in almost **four** less minutes per game, and his team is the one seed."
Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Nikola Jokic  Stephen Curry  LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard
"Crazy how he is even in the discussion tbh, it's totally media fabricated. Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Stephen Curry all have played better during this season than LeBron, heck, even Kawhi in his own city when you consider his defense and his efficiency is more deserving."
"Short version: Lebron has played more games than Embiid, but apart from assists..Joel has been better in every stat."
"If you actually believe that Joel Embiid suddenly became better than Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant from mid-range, go ahead. Just don’t cry when he isn’t in the playoffs lmao."
"Joel """"""The ""Hulu Has ""Do A 180"" Live Sports"" Process"""""""" Embiid"
"You're forgetting about jumpshots. I said it in a comment above but I'll paste it here:  Joel gets a lot of jump shot fouls because  1. Most centers are bad at guarding the jump shot without fouling  2. Embiid gets guarded aggressively because of his tendency for turnovers.  3. Embiid goes for those calls to create space for himself because otherwise you're letting a guy disadvantage you by gambling that you won't try it  From watching games, Joel gets about 2 or 3 rip-throughs per-game, which is where you'll find that difference in fouls. Not to mention, Jokic does attack the rim but he does it differently and is guarded differently than Embiid."
"Well Joel gets a lot of jump shot fouls because  1. Most centers are bad at guarding the jump shot without fouling  2. Embiid goes for those calls to create space for himself because otherwise you're letting a guy disadvantage you by gambling that you won't try it  3. Embiid gets guarded aggressively because of his tendency for turnovers.  I think you'd have to consider jump-shots FTs when comparing the two, that's probably where you'll find your difference."
"Not to mention if we're first seed, that's all that matters. One thing that pisses me off is when people compare records of MVPs teams without considering different conferences: if the Lakers are the 2 seed and have more wins than the Sixers but the Sixers are the 1 seed, the Sixers are better off in the playoffs up until the finals. If Joel sits a few and we still retain the one seed, then it really shouldn't affect his value at all unless you want to dive into finals home-court, which is a real stretch to base MVP off of.  Also, why is the narrative ""if Embiid sits too much he shouldn't be MVP"" rather than ""Damn, Embiid just dropped one of the best stat-lines in the modern era while dealing with a lingering back injury""?"
Did you forget Joel Embiid?
"What is he, Joel Embiid?"
Joel Embiid would’ve took that game home... take that how you will.
Marcus Smart and Kyle Lowry are the real Embiid stoppers. They flop every time they are switched on him and get the call 1/4 times. Which is damn good when you can give Joel a foul once every four times.
"I was responding to the part about ""the rest of the contenders"", as if they're all in a class of their own, and Joel is by himself in a tier below. It's only an argument that works with LeBron, that he has led his team to 3 more wins than Embiid, and I'm saying that while it's an argument in favor for LeBron, it's more relevant than 6 more games, or 200 more minutes or whatever, which means it's not nearly as big a deal as everyone likes to make it seem."
"&gt;It’s astonishing people actually believe Embiid is ducking competition. Maybe if LeBron didn’t cheap shot him he wouldn’t have a tight back.   He already reportedly had a 'tight back' that he missed games for long before the Lakers game where LeBron tried to reportedly assassinate him.   He missed the game vs Jokic outta nowhere despite clearing COVID protocol. Doc has a history of letting his stars make decisions for themselves on whether or not to play.   [https://sports.yahoo.com/doc-rivers-explains-why-joel-184522500.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/doc-rivers-explains-why-joel-184522500.html)  Superstars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons have both been listed as out for Saturday afternoon’s contest with the Denver Nuggets as the teams get set to take the floor. Their reasoning for being out has nothing to do with COVID.  “Yeah, but it has nothing to do with it, they’re just not playing,” said coach Doc Rivers.  Embiid left his 7 other teammates to bust their ass for 40+ min while he could rest. What an MVP."
"It won't just be because he cools down, it'll also be because he'll eventually have to play better opponents and stop hiding from guys like Gobert in favor of playing an injured Nurkic or Thaddeus Young, who are easy buckets.   He's literally ducking teams, bailing out before his coach realizes he's sitting out the game in order to avoid competition and no one's made a peep about it, lmao. Lost a lotta respect for him  [https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/30908195/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-late-scratch-vs-utah-jazz-back-tightness](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30908195/philadelphia-76ers-joel-embiid-late-scratch-vs-utah-jazz-back-tightness)  He's so lucky he plays in the East and will get to feast on teams like Brooklyn or Boston who have no big men. His numbers would plummet even faster if he was facing regular comp"
"They have played 7 games together are 6-1 in those games and that’s with no time to play together and in incomplete roster. We are 10-1 against .500 above teams our one loss non of them played in... it absolutely is not underperforming in this weird covid season. Harden came a month ago, Kyrie was gone for two weeks, KD and Kai had covid protocols. Joel Embiid deserves MVP even if you guys end as second seed"
"Nice topic.  There are two best ""Embiid stoppers"" in recent NBA seasons: Al Horford (Celtics) and Marc Gasol (Raptors)  Both of them out of this race in the East right now and as you said, there are not much player in the conference who can guard Joel. After every success, every rival should counter for biggest threat.   In a word, yes, If Sixers can success this season, teams will try to get and create Embiid stoppers."
Joel Embiid is averaging 30.5 points on 17. 8 FGA/a. That's absurd.
"He wouldn't it's not that clear cut, he's not even leading the betting odds       LeBron James +180  Joel Embiid +450  Nikola Jokic +500  Luka Doncic +1000  Giannis Antetokounmpo +1200  Steph Curry +1200  Kevin Durant +1400  Damian Lillard +2500  Kawhi Leonard +4000  Donovan Mitchell +6600"
Joel Hans Embiid
"LBJ is deserving, but the new blood should carry this torch. Embiid was blasted by pundits while they celebrated Antentokounmpo (who received back to back honors). This is Joel Embiids MVP season, period."
"Joel Embiid leads LeBron James in all major statistical categories except, obviously, for assists. Embiid is shooting better from all areas of the court including the free throw line. James' Lakers are 22-8 second seed in the West, Embiid's Sixers are 20-10 first in the East. Embiid beat James head to head on ESPN in their only meeting to date. Embiid has missed six games this season, James none.   Surely, there must be something I missed."
Yep.   Joel Embiid  10-16 feet (2020): 40.7%  10-16 feet (2021): 52.0%  16-3P (2020): 35.5%  16-3P (2021): 63.8%  ——————  Nikola Jokic  10-16 feet (2020): 49.0%  10-16 feet (2021): 52.6%  16-3P (2020): 43.5%  16-3P (2021): 58.1%  Both are also shooting significantly better from deep though as well
"Nah give more credit to Nurse, Embiid used to be terrible at passing out of double teams (until this season) and while Gasol is a very good Embiid defender (he's patient, he doesn't reach, he doesn't jump, and he's heavy), the difference between Embiid playing okay and Embiid struggling was the double teams that caused turnovers, bad passes, and Joel to play out of his comfort zone"
"Did you fuck up the quote that bad or did ESPN?  Tobias Harris said he would tell his kids he played with Joel Embiid.  If his kids asked who was the best player he ever played with, Tobi said he would say Joel Embiid."
hes the best perimeter defender yes. obviously what those two do defensively is drastically different.  if I had to pick 1 on defense only I'd take ben because of how perimeter offense drives the league but in a vacuum I believe Joel is better at what he does defensively than ben.  most of the time players dont even try to score on embiid at the rim

Joel embiid
"Hopefully his back gets better and better as we get farther removed from the *hard foul* he took in the Lakers game. He's still going to miss some games for rest because he's not 6'8"" LeBron James he's 7'2"" 280 lbs. Joel Embiid. Honestly, James at 36 should probably not be playing every game either.   But on a broader point, in a year where there is a condensed schedule, and players are missing games for reasons largely out of their control, if a player is significantly ahead of the pack in terms of MVP and his team is a top two seed missed games (as long as it's not too many) should not be held against anyone as much as it would be in a regular season. Whether or not Embiid is far ahead of James statically is a matter of personal opinion."
"Joel has a serious case as for the MVP but Lebron beats him out, if the 76ers can win without Embiid then how can you say that he’s more valuable than Lebron. Lebron carries his team single-handedly and they still have one of the best records, every time Lebron sits to rest they quickly lose their lead and Lebron has to get back in to catch-up and close the game."
"I actually think it's going to be extremely easy.  Doc came here to coach those two.  Morey came here to manage those two.  Danny and Dwight came here to get rings with those two.  Other players can see it from miles away; if you want a great chance at a ring, you go play basketball with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons."
Joel Embiid is the best player in the game right now in my opinion. He is the best player currently playing in the NBA today. There is no straight up trade in the league the Sixers would consider for Embiid not Durant not LeBron not Giannis and not Jokic not Kawhi.  If he stays healthy he will dominate the league nobody can stop him and only a few teams have a player that can slow him down a bit.
I don’t know whether to be pleased that Joel Embiid scored 50 points or be pissed off at the fact that it took him this long to play this way.
"Yes the same offensive output. Joel Embiid is the first center since 1981 to average 30 ppg and he’s doing it on .547/.400/.853  Jokic is averaging 27.0 ppg on .571/.404/.875 shooting. Embiid averages 3.1 assists, and Jokic averages 8.6.   I’d say Jokic definitely has the edge as far as offense goes, but id argue a guy averaging roughly the same offensive output on roughly the same percentages is the same offensive output"
"I do agree that Embiid would have to hit another (or maybe even 2 other) gears before being a defender on Hakeems level, but the point on guarding fast players on the perimeter definitely is not the deciding factor.   Tonight, in crunch time, Embiid was out on Lavine. This year, in meaningful crunch time mins, he’s been on the perimeter against Lavine, RWB, Harden, Dame, Fox, Brown.   There are many things that separate Joel/Hakeem but i feel like perimeter defense against guards isn’t one"
"I don't want to be rude, but the truth is this demonstrates poor logical comprehension on your part. There is absolutely no inconsistency between those two statements.  A lion is easily bigger than a housecat, and a planet is easily bigger than an insect. I never said the gap was equally as big.  Anyway, if Jokic wasn't scoring at a similar rate to Embiid (as devastating as Joel is on offense), you might have a case here. But he is... in addition to playing point guard from the center position and running his team's entire offense as arguably the game's best passer. Make no mistake about it - Jokic is an ATG offensive player. It is absolutely no shame to say Embiid is definitely not on that level."
(30 for 30 voice) What if I told you Joel Embiid was +10 in 45 minutes in a game 7 the Sixers lost in regulation
"It's insane how embiid and Simon's went from ""its a toss up for who's the most important player"" to ""if you got to trade one for harden it's Def Simmons"" to ""Joel embiid is the unquestioned star of this team"""
"Wrong again. Embiid had a much better roster than Jokic had. Dude had Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons. It’s not Jokics fault that he can’t elevate his team to a higher level. And again how do you lose to Kawahi? You had Simmons, Butler, Harris and Embiid and you still lost lmao. Meanwhile Jokic has shown that he steps it up in the playoffs and dominates every year. That’s something that Joel can’t attest to. Last year was the 2nd time we made it to the playoffs and we still made it farther than you guys ever have. So please stick to the regular season where you have any chance of a argument lmao."
It's crazy LeBron is +180  Embiid is +450  and Jokic +500  WTF?? I don't even feel comfortable placing these bets because the people who are the best bettors are all wayyy too confident LeBron has this shit bagged up already.   But the numbers tell a much different story. Realistically with his team as Top Seed this should be Joel Embiid award.   Just pointing out how insanely good Jokic has been and if Denver can get to top 4 seed he really deserves it most.
Joel embiid is not a cat
"""So Shaq, you are taking Joel then?""  ""Nah man, I'm taking Embiid."""
Embiid is averaging 3 more PPG than Jokic but yes chief fat Jokic definitely blows Joel out of the water offensively. What a dumbass statement lmao 🤡
Joel politics embiid
"To be fair, you have to take into consideration the weak competition of the era. You see, Joel Embiid played against the Chicago Bulls."
"I haven’t watched many Sixers games this year, this one included but that stat line by Embiid hit me like a truck when I saw it.   Gotta ask, is Rivers doing anything noticeably different with Joel compared to Brett Brown?  Or did Joel just achieve godhood in the off-season?"
Joel “Politics” Embiid was just hitting everything today
"Lol no player other than Joel, Tobi, and Green hit double digits. Embiid literally carried this squad on his back tonight. Insane."
"Doesn't he sit back to backs tho  But I agree why would you not play against the more challenging opponent. Still this is a weak criticism. Why not go for Joel ""Turnover"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid is about to skip his media obligations to get Ben some soup and Tylenol. No one can create without Ben except Joel and Tobias and that's mostly creating for themselves.
Joel Embiid 50/17/5/2/4 on 65/50/88 splits....were witnessing greatness right now
"The shots that have completely vanished since the 90s are mostly still jump shots, they're just the inefficient ones.   Nobody spots up inside the 3-point line, nobody runs plays to generate baseline jumpers on the sides of the key, and unless you're Kawhi Leonard or DeMar DeRozan, you probably don't take long 2s off the dribble.   Post-ups are down overall, but they're far from dead. Joel Embiid was automatic facing up in the post for this entire season; teams just aren't (or shouldn't be) wasting touches on post possessions for guys like Drummond, or like when Dwight Howard was in Charlotte and Atlanta."
"I edited my comment to clarify what I mean before you replied oops.   That is probably the case but it’s odd that they would say that  the closest two are Giannis and Joel and then further clarify if Embiid had not missed games, then it’d be neck and neck. It gives the assumption that they have Joel as third even with the games missed. They don’t even mention Dame in the article and it’s just weird that they have no explanation listed."
"&gt;“And the winner projected by PerThirtySix is: Nikola Jokić!  &gt;Jokić has put up a phenomenal season and the Nuggets finishing strong has put some distance between him and the closest contenders: Giannis Antetokounmpo and **Joel Embiid**. If Embiid had played the same number of games as Jokić while maintaining his level of production, our model has this coming down to the wire. But, as it stands, Jokić is the clear-cut favorite.”  I’m interested why Dame is third and not Embiid? The article itself even states embiid is third in their predictions as it stands now, so I’m just a little confused."
"""Look for Curry and Embiid to make a close push into the top 3. Steph has the scoring trophy and the narrative of his incredible year on his side. Joel Embiid has only played 51 games, but has exceptional per-game stats and voters may find some sympathy in a shortened year."""
Joel embiid
"Joel Embiid, then Antetokounmpo, then Curry."
"Voting Joel Embiid as an All-NBA Forward is totally reasonable if you think he's had a better season than the other options.  Don't let positional biases get in the way of positive progress towards getting rid of positions all together on All-NBA ballots and maybe just getting the best players in the league on the 1st team.  Yes, this position is kinda biased but I stand by it in principle."

Joel Embiid and Tacko Fall are two examples of talent who were somehow African-American before being American.
"Where do you rank him in the league? The Suns have a better record than the 76ers with Joel Embiid... the clippers with Kawhi and PG, and the Bucks with Giannis. People give all this credit to Chris Paul when it comes to the Suns record but when it comes to MVP voting, they say no, and when asked to place them in the league, it is like 15+. If Chris Paul deserves all that credit then he should be considered a top 5 player in the league. He isn't, therefore the rest of the team deserves much of that credit including Monty."
Joel Embiid and making it past the 2nd round.
"Exactly.  The 76ers sometimes work to manufacture midrange looks for Joel Embiid, and he’s over 1pt/attempt.  Embiid’s obviously an outlier, but the points are there if a good player is looking for them."
Gasol shut down 3 All Star bigs during that title run:  - Nikola Vucevic (11.3 pts/g on .436 TS%)  - Joel Embiid (17.6 pts/g on .529 TS%)  - Giannis Antetokounmpo (22.7 pts/g on .518 TS%)
"The roster construction is better, and Embiid is in better shape. But doc even getting Joel to not drop on every screen is huge. Brett refused to add any nuance to either side of the ball. He wasn't handed a perfect roster, but he did nothing to innovate with the players he had. Doc clearly has the players ears in a way brown did not, just look at the way tobias plays defense this year as opposed to last. The team quit on Brett brown by the end"
"I know he’s voting for Rudy, but the section almost felt a little disrespectful to how far above the competition Gobert’s been this season. Saying Embiid is at least as good (and implying Joel is straight up better in another column) is a pretty wild take given the numbers. It’s gonna be a huge uphill battle for Rudy to win the award again after this season."
"So because Joel Embiid can’t dominate al horford for some reason, the sole solution is to over pay an aging center for 4 years. I understand you gotta make moves but how about you put faith in Joel to get better and learn to dominate someone who is getting older and isn’t as good as you anyway"
You really don't think 7'2 Joel Embiid couldn't reach the rim from where he jumped lol
"Joel Embiid, trying in the fourth quarter an select other times when he feels like it, is easily still the second best rim protector in the league and it isn't close between him and third. He changes the entire opposing offenses desire to even get to the rim with pure reputation. Even when he isn't trying all that hard or it's early in the game you never know when he'll just decide to go hard after a shot.   He had done a great job of managing his fouls this year. Obviously we need him in the court offensively, but Joel going into the fourth with two or three fouls is so damn deadly on defense. He and Ben know that's the best time to go all out because it's far less likely they call ticky tack shut on you.   Assuming Gobert is number one here absolutely deserves second team All Defense"
"embiid literally bullies everyone on the court smaller than him, which is basically everyone. not saying he deserves to get injured but if there’s anyone i don’t have much sympathy for lebron shoving mid-air it would definitely be joel."
"Lebron shoved the shit out of Embiid mid air so he wouldn’t get dunked on.  This man has 0 shame. Solomon Hill made a basketball play, Lebron made a business decision and could’ve seriously hurt Joel.  Fuck LeBron."
That's interesting coming from the man that hit Joel Embiid with one of the dirtiest mid-air shoves that I've ever seen sending JoJo to the hard court flat on his back.
"Joel Embiid was cruising to NBA MVP until a ""grown man"" pushed him from behind while he was defenseless in the air."
"B+ :  \- We finally stopped the whole ""chase the 8th seed at all cost"" and picked a direction, we'll have a high pick  \- 2 of the 3 rookies looked great  \- the ""bets"" we made on Grant, Jackson and Plumlee all trned out better than I expected  \- despite being bad, we were competitive for most of the season, the games weren't unwatchable  \- I didn't have to watch Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson think they are Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook while actually being Erick Dampier and Jeff Teague  \- If Hayes looked better it would've been an A"

"The Joel Embiid full court shot, that shot was insane and how close it was into going in."
You just lost to Paul “skinny Joel embiid” Reed and Tyrese “Ben simmons with dreads” Maxey
Joel “Do a 180” Embiid
Joel “Troel” Embiid
"That's an incredibly stupid take. Patrick Ewing was a center, and didn't play the role of a passing threat.   The Knicks ran point guards out there and had the likes of Anthony Mason who was basically a point forward.   Julius Randle runs the offense because our starting point guard is Elfrid Payton.  You might as well look at Joel Embiid and say he's overrated because he doesn't pass as much as Julius."
"So one season of Jimmy Butler where they lost in 7 to the eventual champions means Joel has done less with more help...?  Come one man, Embiid and Simmons brought the sixers to the playoffs way sooner than expected. When the Sixers make the finals and the Nuggets flame out in the first round I hope you keep this same zeal...  And how are you gonna act like Jokic/Murray/MPJ/Grant/Millsap/Barton/Beasley/Plumlee/Morris isn’t an absolutely stacked team lol  If you can only count in “All Stars” then you’re a pretty surface-level NBA fan"

Joel Embiid
"Sure, but how do you propose the Sixers were to get them given the asset base Hinkie started with in summer 2013?  He inherited the worst asset situation in the NBA when he took over - the team had very few positive player assets and owed multiple future 1sts.  If they somehow made the playoffs in either of his first two seasons, they lose their 1st round pick.  The only comparatively miserable asset situation I've seen in the NBA in the time period since was the Nets a few years ago when they had little to work with and owed the Celtics multiple future 1sts.  They bottomed out as well (not by choice) and made some good decisions, though they've been largely saved by the ridiculous NYC free agent advantage that Philly and the majority of lesser cities could never hope to replicate.  Staying the course and not tanking would have been a significantly inferior strategic decision.  It's extremely difficult to envision an alternative scenario where a GM steps into Philly's situation in the 2013 offseason and delivers a better result without tanking than we're experiencing right now.  It's also important to remember that it was one single record breaking bad season, not multiple.  2015-16 is the only season that the Sixers were the worst team in the NBA, and that season likely doesn't even occur if Joel Embiid doesn't have a massive setback that causes him to miss a second season."
"Trae's using clever tactics and gamesmanship to make up for his lack of size lol, it's not as bad Joel Embiid doing it."
"Joel Embiid, imagine the most dominate big man in the block with the sky fucker at the top of the key.  Who you gonna double?"
"Joel had played 31 games in 3 years up to that point I was an Embiid fan and even I said back then it’s at best 50-50 he’ll even end up being able to have a real viable long term career. We’ve all been real lucky with that. It’s the same reason why the guy who was 5th in mvp voting the most previous season Isaiah Thomas was only 40th durability concerns. And you saw in ITs case why, hell that ranking ended up being way too high in hindsight"
"Except with much better defense and much worse offense, so nothing like Joel Embiid."
He’d be a slightly worse version of Joel Embiid
Google Joel Embiid
"Joel Embiid is the anti-Westbrook. Straight pussy. I’ve been sitting in silence for years over different accounts as all you nephews hate on my boy Brodie. So, now I’m going in on one of the most overrated player in NBA history to: 1.) see how hating feels 2.) set the record straight on Joel “Papa Doc” “Clarence” Embiid. 3.) Clear some space in the top ten for Russ.    Let’s go.   Joel Embiid is not a top 10 player. He had a pretty good season this year, but he calls into work all the time. Never played more than 64 games. He averages 37 games a year. Yes, that’s right kids. 37. And yes I am averaging in his zero-games-played seasons because he’s a clown who refused responsibility. His initial injury his rookie year was supposed to keep him out 4 months. He had his official “rookie,” year 3 years into his career. He didn’t have bad luck. He chose to fuck off physical therapy, didn’t lift, and refused to take his diet seriously for years. Those seasons don’t get retakes. They get big ol’ fat zeros in the grade book.    Additionally, the way he flops and flails as a big man is a crime against the basketball gods. If he were treated like Jokic, Embiid would be out of the league. Yes. Seriously.  Without all the coddling and preferential treatment he’d be Hasheem Thabeet part 2.   This will be his greatest season ever...and he’ll be lucky to make it to the second round of the playoffs. I’ve had the chore of watching this guy since his days at Kansas. I’m convinced the NBA is propagating his success to maintain and engage in Africa. Bring on the downvotes.    Source: I’m an old has been who was an all-metro honorable mention. We had no height on my school team so I volunteered to play center at 6’6” 155 pounds. I was giving up 30 to fifty pounds a night to my opposing big, and I gave ‘em hell every night. 15 years later I’m still in the top ten for rebounds, blocks, and defensive assists at my school. Without doxing myself too much my nickname was literally the Worm, like Rodman.    In the summer for AAU I played the 2 and the 3, and thus I got to play with and against guys who made it to the NBA. Specifically in the Kansas area of tornado alley. I know players who played for Nebraska, Creighton, Colorado State, Kansas, Memphis, Iowa State NW Missouri State (DII champs baby!) Furthermore, I’ve met and played against 7 players who play or played professionally. 3 of whom got drafted. 2 of which are still in the league. Moreover, I’ve broken my leg playing twice and since my parents didn’t have great insurance I didn’t get the proper physical therapy I should have. And yet I still played in every season to senior year. So, yeah. I sit back and watch Embiid’s hand get held and I’m salty, but rightfully so.    One last thing. I have a massive amount of respect for advanced stats and people who love the game who didn’t play. So, this isn’t me thinking I know more. I don’t. But I put my heart and soul into this game for damn near 20 years, and to see guys like Embiid rise to the top makes my blood boil. Now excuse me and my typos while i go feed my father with dementia breakfast as i feel like shit from my second covid shot before i go to work at the Home Depot and guess who’s not calling in?    Now give my boy Russ some love. He’s top ten. God damn."

"What if I’m Joel Embiid in the paint and I just pump faked Brook Lopez, who is between me and the basket, out of his shoes? You’re telling me not to jump into him and get the and-1? Sounds like a pretty short sided strategy by someone who’s never played the game."
Jokic and Embiid don't even have the years to even evaluate them right. What has either of those players done so far to be honored by a top 10 spot?  Did they average a triple double back to back years? Did they make the playoffs 10 out of his 13 years in the league?  It took 2 years to even see Joel play basketball after he was drafted. Jokic was drafted the same year and has played 192 more games then Joel. Also in 6 years Jokic has been to the playoffs twice.
Trust the Process! - Joel Embiid
I wish Joel Embiid trains with Hakeem. Jojo is like the NBA taskmaster.
"It’s clearly based on bias. Joel Embiid has been living on the floor this series. If that doesn’t indicate he’s a high level flopper, I don’t know what does."
Wait hold up. I’m a racist for not liking Joel Embiid?
AD’s not a center like Embiid or Joel though
Wait…JOEL EMBIID is complaining about fouls calls? You have to be joking right? He has to be.
"I think this all the time. People put him on the Coach Pop category of coaches who can do no wrong, but he has won one championship and had so many really, really good teams. I don’t get why the media fawns over him at all.   Full disclosure, I’m a Heat fan and people tend to say the Heat started the super team craze that continues today. I wonder if everyone forgets about the Celtics a few years earlier. Persoanally, I think it is because they crazy underperformed. They had the best 3-point shooter of his era (and ever before Curry, Klay, Lillard). They had Garnett, who revolutionized the PF position with the likes of Duncan and Dirk and Pierce, who was widely thought of as being one of the only people who could really frustrate LeBron. Besides them, they had some really, really solid supporting casts.   Nobody thinks of them at all, because it is my belief that they really underperformed. I agree with OP that he is good at managing talented players and big egos, but Steve Nash has had a great season as a first year head coach with the Nets and those egos are titanic. Yet, there isn’t a lot of grumbling. That may be an unnecessary comparison, but my point is just that good coaches should be able to manage egos.   I’d compare Doc to Coach Bud on the Bucks. Coach Bud has had some really talented teams, certainly none as talented as the best of Doc’s teams with 2-3 superstars for almost the last two decades, but Coach Bud can get a team like Atlanta or Milwaukee with a stud and some other guys or, in the case of Atlanta, a bunch of nearly superstar level players to the height of the Eastern Conference, but can’t get over the hump. Doc got over the hump because he had some legendary talent. He continued to have some legendary talent and not do a lot with it.  How many years have Doc-coached teams been favorites or near favorites to win titles?   I could name like 10 (okay, realistically at least 5) head coaches I’d take ahead of Doc at this point.    He covered Trae with Danny Green in game 1. That’s unforgivable when your PG brags about being a DPOY candidate and can’t be in the game in clutch time for fear of being fouled. Then, the coach, throws up the white flag in the first game of the series, because why? Simmons is too big and slow to guard Trae? He needs to hide on some unathletic SF like Bogdonovic or Gallo? What the heck? I think if you assume you are a DPOY candidate, your coach should have the confidence in you to guard your own position. I know technically, Simmons plays as a kind of point forward as the Sixers, but dude is still listed as a PG. Poor Joel Embiid carrying that team every year on his wonky legs."
Joel Embiid stays crying that’s the biggest bish in the NBA
"Context my guy context, Embiid was sick that series and also carrying the defense load. We can have this argument all day long. Bottom line, Embiid is the most dominate big man in the NBA on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball. Jokic is an awesome passer and has great touch, but doesn’t help his defensively in the slightest. If you wanna talk about foul calls look at how they play there game, Joel is a physical low post player which is why he gets more fouls, Jokic mainly operates from the high post and rarely makes moves that would generate a foul call."
Joel Embiid leads the league in free throws attempted this postseason at 99. Trae Young has played 1 more game than Embiid and still has attempted less free throws than him.  Joel Embiid led the league in free throw attempts during the regular season at 10.6; the next closest was run and dunk man with 9.3 per game.  Joel Embiid leads the Hawks-76ers series with 72 free throws attempted. Trae Young is next with 58. Dude goes 1 night without getting every call and starts crying about it. Fraudulent ass team just salty they're going to 7 with the baby Hawks.
I don’t blame Collins for being angry even though I don’t think Joel did anything wrong. I really understand Collins pushing/kicking Embiid off but I also don’t blame embiid for being mad at what Collins did. It’s a physical game with a lot of pressure. This stuff is going to happen. They both lashed out and they both stopped themselves from going too far. We can all chill out.
Joel Embiid is not Dwight Howard
"Last I checked basketball is still a team sport so I don't get that comment. You can replace Seth in the off-season, you 100% can't replace Embiid lol. Seth is just a role player in the team and his role is to shoot the 3.     Sixers have a way to win with Seth shot not falling. But Sixers don't have a way to win with Joel Embiid off the floor."
"Joel Embiid is one to fucking talk, I’ve really developed a hatred for him over the course of this series. He should have been ejected for diving on JC in game 5 and the refs really let him throw his temper tantrums whenever he feels like it"
"“I’ll give you Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, and two firsts for a large pizza and a Kali Mist from Cheba Hut.”"
"No matter how this game 7 goes, Joel Embiid has taught me that he is truly a child"
"It’s not just about Embiid, and it’s specifically about game 6.  Joel Embiid was the first starter to shoot free throws with 7 minutes left in the 4th quarter, despite our team scoring most of our points in the paint all game.  Philly averaged the second most free throws per game for a reason: We have a lot of big guys who like to score down low, who get fouled a lot while doing it.   Am I supposed to believe the Atlanta Hawks defense didn’t commit a single shooting foul on our starters until the 4th quarter?"
"Sixers have shot 157 free throws this series to Hawks 144. The player who has shot the most free throws this series is...Joel Embiid with 72 (to Trae Young's 58).  Trae was fouled a whopping 2 times last night.  Ahh yes. I, too, wish they would call it both ways Joel."
Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis are the most unwatchable big men in the league. Literally just fall down every other possession.
Trae is an ant compared to Embiid. Joel a big dude and can really hurt someone. Like that silly moment when stretched his arms out and was knocking Collins around... I was kinda scared for Collins
"Can you refer me to any other times Joel has “cried in the post games”? His play style leads to free throws — it’s a physical, dominating, paint presence which is why he lead the league in FTs.    You’re so hung up on Embiid and the fouls he gets that you are missing the bigger point — embiid just wants the refs to call it the same way on both sides. If you’re going to let Atlanta be physical on defense, do the same for Philly. If you’re going to call questionable foul calls for Trae, do the same thing on the other end. Establish what is a foul and fall it consistently. I doubt Joel says anything if the refs don’t put Tobi and Ben in foul trouble on weak calls."
"Absolutely. If you would've told me I'd be rooting for Trae Young over Joel Embiid a year ago, I would have told you to fuck off."
"Wow, TIL the Sixers have 3 of the top 4 defensive RAPTORs this postseason:  (1)  George Hill.  (3). Matisse Thybulle    (4) Joel Embiid."
"Imagine being like 7 feet tall, almost 300 pounds, and complaining about the refs all the time. Same guy who was fouling other guys with no calls and saying “ITS THE PLAYOFFS!” Joel Embiid is straight up made out of cookie dough. Dude also blatantly dove at John Collins’ knee with absolutely no consequences. Fuck this guy."
"Joel ""for the home crowd"" Embiid has awoken!"
Are you implying it isn’t just as obvious when Trae is flopping as it is when Joel is flopping? Both of them are pretty easy to spot. The officials are still calling fouls when Trae flops but not when Embiid does.
Embiid sells contact because he’s fouled almost every time he touches the ball in the paint. Big men get punished for being able to take more contact than guards. Trae flails when he initiates contact with his own off hand. Embiid flails after the defender has fouled him to draw attention.   I do agree Embiid would get some calls he doesn’t if he didn’t flail to emphasize the contact but he would also be missing out on a lot of fouls that the refs clearly aren’t calling down low.   Embiid is obviously pointing out this discrepancy— that Trae is getting paraded to the line on ticky tacky foul calls compared to Joel or Tobias getting pummeled in the paint and the refs swallowing their whistles.
Joel Embiid didn’t take a free throw until the fourth quarter despite leading the league in FTAs/game
"Being 3rd in MVP voting means he had an MVP season. It just so happens that other players had better MVP seasons. Joel Embiid just had an MVP season, but Jokic had a better one."
Hear me out: Joel Embiid.

"Embiid was getting fouled a LOT and rather violently though. Its not like there weren't several dozen clear FT opportunities for him.  Hell, Collins fouled him, Joel gets called for an offensive foul. Then: Collins shoves him, Joel gets a tech. WTF was that?"
"If Simmons was any threat to score from ANYWHERE on the court we’d have won a title by now. Even if he stayed in the corner completely unguarded he’d be a bigger help than he is now. Embiid has had to play his whole career against his man, Ben’s man a few feet away, and Ben next to his man completely clogging the paint. It would be one thing if Ben at least got a lot of o-boards and putbacks, but mostly he just stands there and allows the other team to basically double team Joel on every post up. Joel developed his 3 and face-up game because Ben Simmons is incapable of recognizing that anything he does is negative."
"Joel ""not my eye Kelso"" Embiid"
"When have you seen a postseason where almost every team in both conference dealt with injuries to their stars. Lakers- James, AD, Nuggets- Jamal Murray, Clippers- Kawhi, Brooklyn- Harden, Washington- Beal was hurt, Jazz- Spida, Celtics- Jaylen Brown. Sixers- Joel Embiid, Hawks- Trae Young"
"I know you're not serious but this is literally how Sixers fans are thinking in their team's three losses to date. ""Simmons missed 5 free throws and our team lost by 4 therefore he is solely responsible for the loss!"". This logic has been upvoted through multiple comments the last few days. They just conveniently forget that Joel Embiid went 0-12 in the second half of game four while playing hero ball the entire 4th quarter...forget that Harris went 2-11 yesterday in a loss...forget that Doc Rivers has a history of blowing big leads in playoff games. Yep, forget all that, Ben Simmons' free throws are the sole reason the Sixers are in this hole. I appreciate that he has some serious soul searching to do and has been terrible these last couple of games but to lay 100% of the blame on him is pretty damn stupid..."
joel embiid would like a word
"Collins literally dunked through Embiids neck and Embiid is dishing out pain because Collina got caught on a putback? Both of which were called foula against Joel, btw."
"Being a fan of this franchise fucking sucks. Why do I have to be born in Utah? I'd rather be a fucking Lions and Mariners fans. At least the fans know to only have hope for not even half the season. Need to ask Mariners and true post-1967 Maple Leafs fans how to have a dick punch be not as painful and become more resiliant to it.   Legacy of Failure for us soon, guys. We deserve it. We let a team with a Matt Cooke and Raffi Torres make the Finals. And they were without their Sidney Crosby.  Fire Quin Snyder to the fucking moon. I'm done with him. Regular season means jackshit. The only thing I care about is winning the fucking title. You guys can suck again or choke again for the rest of my life afterwards. Just one title, that is all I fucking ask for. I don't care that RSL has a title. One, I dislike MLS and don't care for RSL, and two, MLS feels like Minor League Soccer compared to every other Soccer organization in the world.  I knew we were going to blow it. Quin, you adjusted so bad that you could type 100 word per minute and end up having your adjusted typing speed being 0 words per minute because all the worse you typed were fucking errors. You never adjusted after Game 1. You only won Game 2 because the Clippers stopped hitting.   Fuck good season. Fuck our medical staff, it has always fucking sucked. Joel Embiid has a torn meniscus, and he still fights like a lion. Yet our medical staff can't fix Mitchell or Conley?  Mitchell had a bad Game 5, and it sucks. We can't let him go, he is the only damn good thing for us right now, and he wants to play for us. Utah, as a state, needs him. And the team and coaching staff fucking let him down. I'd rather get swept. Bucks and Sixers can't choke worse than us.  I'm fucking angry, man. I know the Reds and Arizona Cardinals will find a way to disappoint me like they always do. The Flyers already disappoints me, and somehow getting dick-punched by the 2021 Sabres twice wasn't as painful as being a Jazz fan. Like with the Jazz, regular season means shit, all I want is a fucking title.    Congrats, Clips, without Kawhi, that matchup with Phoenix will be tough."
"Mvp jokic disagrees. Despite losing, he still crushed it. Ayton played great. AD is a big, despite his protestations. he won a chip last year. Gasol/ibaka the year before. Bigs just need to actually be good. Edit: id love to see batum guard joel embiid. Or giannis."
"Things I totally expected: Terrence Mann is the leading scorer of the playoffs today in less minutes than Paul George, Donovan Mitchell, Joel Embiid and Trae Young"
Dude we were two baskets from losing in 6 to the hawks  Our Max contract PG took 1 shot the last 3 second halves.   What the fuck do I have to be excited about aside from the fact that god himself decided to play as Joel Embiid for a season
Adam Silver has never liked Joel Embiid because of how much he embraced and stands for the process.   He’ll never get that benefit from a league standpoint
"Welp. I get more and more confused every day as to why I’m in the minority for hating Joel Embiid. Dude is the most annoying player in the league by a mile to me. I understand his talent but good lord I just do not like his personality in the slightest bit. You just fouled someone, fell on top of them while weighing close to 300 lbs and YOU get pissed for someone moving you off of them? And then do some bullshit ass “I’m going to try to intimidate you but also actively act like I’m being the victim with my arms out wondering what’s going on.” I’ve been on this hill for awhile and I’ll continue to die on it. Joel Embiid is a fucking douchebag."
"Collins ran under the hoop in the restricted area, shoved Joel on the ground, and pulled Embiid as towards the stands as trae pushed him.  Fuck off redditors"
People that ok the embiid card when we complain about traes full baiting can not be watching this series. Joel. Should have 100 ftas at this point
Maybe if we had Brook Lopez. When you have a center with as high of a usage rate as Joel Embiid you need a stretch 4
"But he's still a slashing ball handler and playmaker who shot 86% from the line this season. You don't need to go 4 or 5 legitimate shooters on the floor every single time. You can easily go Jimmy+Joel+three shooters because you can't hack Jimmy and he's not scared to be aggressive and have the ball in the clutch.  There's a big difference between Jimmy in the clutch--who would be attacking and making plays for everyone, and also taking responsibility away from an exhausted Embiid--and Ben in the clutch--who is either standing in the dunker's spot, clogging the paint for Embiid, or getting hacked and sent to the free throw line."
Joel “Andrew Bynum” Embiid
"In the Moment, how are the refs supposed to do literally anything to stop an angry Joel Embiid from making John Collins his bitch if he wants to?"
"“Joel Embiid, you’re not gonna cover Clint Capela tonight, you’re gonna go one-on-one…. WITH THE UNDERTAKER!”"
Joel Embiid telling Cole Beasley to hold his beer
Undertaker obviously taking out his Triple H hatred on Joel Embiid
They're finally pulling the trigger on the Undertaker vs Joel Embiid feud
I can't wait for the lights to come back on and Joel Embiid is on the floor with a steel chair next to him.
More embarrassing is Brett Brown choosing to build around Ben Simmons over both Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid. Brett Brown traded Embiid's two best friends on the team in the 2019 offseason to build around Simmons.
Bro 100 pound trae was not moving the 7 foot monster in Embiid. Joel was going there regardless
He pushed Embiid but the second Joel got mad and stood over him Collins shat his pants
How the fuck are refs meant to stop an angry 7’1 270 pound Joel Embiid
"Joel is 100% gone. On review maybe a tech on Trae for pushing, but Embiid is for sure getting ejected."
Collins is a dipshit there. He shove Embiid and then has his arm around his neck. Lucky Joel just decided to T-Pose on him.
Joel Embiid bodied Collins with the power of Christ
Joel 'JUST BLEED' Embiid!
Joel Embiid is an emotional toddler
Joel did absolutely nothing. Collins pushed embiid. Then trae pushed embiid into collins
"Joel ""Jokic"" Embiid"
Joel Embiid behaves like a 7 year old on the court

"I got tickets to the Flacons game When the Sixers play, I got a seat with my name I'd guess, yoouu'd say What can make me feel this way?  My girl, my girl Talkin bout my giiiirl. My girl.  I've got sooooo much honey, the thread envies me I've got a sweeter wife than Joel Embiid Well, I'd guess you'd say  What can make me feel this way?  My girl, my girl Talkin bout my giiiirl. My girl.  OoooooOoHhooooo Hey hey hey  Oooooo Yeah  I don't need no streaming, subscriptions,  or cable TV I got all the riches baby one man can claim Well, I'd guess you'd say  What can make me feel this way?

Joel Embiid has 0 FTAs through 3 quarters and y'all want to say they're calling it both ways.
Joel Embiid was 27
"I´m not a big fan of Embiid normally, but how is that a foul on him? Was a very cool dunk by the way, but I see no foul from Joel there."
Wow with the on-court death of Joel Embiid these playoffs really are missing a lot of stars
RIP in peace Joel Embiid
"""You miss 100% of the flops you don't take, Trae Young"" - Joel Embiid - Michael Scott - Wayne Gretzky"
Hawks up by 4 despite Trae on fire and Embiid being off.  They can't afford to have Trae going cold because Joel could easily have a big 2nd half.  I still don't understand how this game has been so close.
Where is the elite defense of Joel Embiid?
Why is Simmons standing under the basket where Embiid is trying to work in the post ?   He’s crowding the paint and allowing Joel to get doubled. This dude is shook
Joel Embiid literally just almost destroyed John Collins knees last game with his flopping. Pls stop.
"2018 was a long time ago my man. Al Horford was a 31 year old all-star, Terry Rozier was balling tf out, and Joel Embiid wasn't an MVP candidate.  I agree that Tatum and Brown will be significantly better than they were, but what does Boston have outside of that? They have no identity at the moment, and it doesn't make sense to believe in them until they do."
"Joel is a very good shooter for a center. Zion is scoring 27ppg on 65% TS in his 2nd year while having the paint clogged by Adams who's a much worse shooter than embiid. Zion getting hindered by Adams is a myth, since he can finish through practically anyone. BI is the one who's worse, since he's a good finisher and the paint is clogged with both Zion and Adams."
"Jokic  **Edit:** Oooh, Realistic. In that case, Joel Embiid."
Maybe paired with... joel embiid... might change things.  Cj McCollum is a *strict* upgrade to ben simmons in everything but defense.
"[https://www.insider.com/ranked-best-centers-nba-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-2021-4](https://www.insider.com/ranked-best-centers-nba-joel-embiid-nikola-jokic-2021-4)   Not my list, but I find it easy to rank Theis firmly behind every name on that list.  I think Horford is a big step up from the Centers you've had in his absence."
"I suppose, but you can kinda make that argument for almost every MVP candidate. Was Joel Embiid the reason the 76ers got the 1 seed? Or was it Doc's coaching, bringing in Green and Curry? It's hard to say, but regardless I don't think it's an outrageous thing to say that CP3 had an MVP worthy season."

"&gt; players complained about him  Did they? I know a lot of our guys liked him because he was  upfront about how he handled GM duties. And he wasn't always some cold, analytics robot. He and Embiid were super tight. Hinkie bent over backwards to be there for Joel when his brother died back in Cameroon. Hinkie also famously drove Evan Turner to the airport after trading him and allowed Evan to vent his frustrations and ask about why he was being traded. Here's what Evan said:         &gt;“It was random, for sure,” Turner said. “But I can shoot the s--- with anyone. It was cool, man. Hinkie is definitely a cool guy. He comes off as reserved. Sometimes you don’t really know what to take from him at first, but he talks and he’s cool and he has pretty cool stories. It was just a kind gesture. I appreciate that.”"
"He already does a lot well for a 21-year-old, plus he is 7'2.   Celtics were not going to compete for anything with 6'6-6'8 guys playing at Center. Not in a division that has KD, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam, Kyrie Irving, &amp; Ben Simmons.   I get that small ball is the trend right now, but the Celtics need a guy who will make elite players like those guys that think twice about driving to the hoop.   Tacko is tall, but got into basketball really late and it shows because he's still very green.   They needed some true bigs that could come in &amp; play right away. And Stevens should sign Brown to a contract that's more in line with a late first round pick to keep him around."

All nba forward Joel embiid
Joel Embiid should just play point forward and Ben Simmons traditional center
"&gt;I’m trying super hard to not judge this playoffs because of how bizarre this season has been as a whole   There's nothing weird about this series, like, not at all. Embiid has a minor injury that only gets brought up when he underperforms, and pretty much everything else about the 6ers is about as normal as you could ever ask for.    &gt;their entire offensive system being broken down with Joel being hurt.  Embiid's averaging 32 and 13. The guy's conditioning has been an issue his entire career, people acting like the fact that he's fading in the 2nd half is because his knee spontaneously starts affecting him is a reach. He gets visibly tired in the 4th, it's not him grabbing his knee or anything. Hell, the guy falls damn near every other possession and ends up fine.   --------  Ben is losing to Trae with the runner-up for league MVP and another borderline All-Star on his team. There is literally no discussion. If you swapped Ben and Trae this wouldn't even be a series. The Hawks don't even beat the Knicks with Ben.  Trae vs Embiid is a more reasonable discussion than Trae vs Simmons."
Especially considering how likely he is to be *very* injury prone. He's big strong and heavy and the way his knees are causes him to walk/run weird.   I see him having issues somewhere between Greg Oden and Joel Embiid
"I'm not discrediting the role of a PG. I also understand that although the spacing would help Embiid, PSkills isn't close to the passer. He's competent, but not as a primary passer. My argument is simply in this series versus the Hawks if you swapped the two of them it would be a different series.   Simmons has lost the 76ers games this series. Enough that his inability to make shots or hit FTs has blown games. The longer these playoffs go the bigger risk of an already hurt Embiid hurting himself worse trying to do too much which isn't what I want to see happen to one of the best (and my favourite) players in the league. The series should have been wrapped up and Joel resting but Ben's poor play has put a clear favorite in a 3 - 2 hole.  - a lmfao Raps fan"
They are statistically not even close efficiently.   Embiid TS% 66%  Giannis TS% 54.1%   League Average Regular Season TS% 57.2%  And their expected production for their role on their team in my mind is the same. Giannis has fallen short of that and Joel hasn’t.
What do you mean Joel Embiid. A few nights ago he was the only one on the Sixers who sucked.  Embiid can play the four. Jokic is the center heheh
[Joel Embiid has the same impact on the game as Tim Duncan did ](http://imgur.com/gallery/2E40h3w)
We wasted the prime of arguably the best player in the history of football and the Sixers are wasting the prime years of Joel Embiid right now.
"Remember, he made more $$$ than the likes of Giannis, Jokic, and Jaylen Brown this season, and about $300,000 less than Joel Embiid."
"Curry was shooting lights out, so Atlanta decided to attack him on the defensive end to tire him out. It worked. Curry went cold as he got tired chasing whoever he was guarding. Same with Embiid. As Capela has said, their tactic is simply to tire out Joel. With Curry and Embiid going cold, no one else on the Sixers could score reliably. Simmons can't be relied upon and Harris has always wet the bed in the playoffs.  Rivers-led team has always had weak mental fortitude. There must be something about his coaching that just engenders his teams to fold when faced with adversity.  One thing to note though is that Rivers cannot for the life of him adjust in-game."
"I love any analysis that gives the hawks credit and I had us winning the series, and agree that plenty of blame to go around although as much as it pains I'll argue any joel slander at the moment.    That said Ben simmons, while he is known for playmaking and defense, averaged 18 pts a game and that was part of his all star selection. He in no way shape or firm lived up to his side of that deal. I can live with bad free throw shooting, capela does it all the time, but I can't live with anyone much less a 30 mil a year guy, who is utterly unwilling yo try and score. He became completely useless in the halfcourt and his assists were mostly just fastbreaks or kick shots from curry off a screen, the rest of their offense was predicated on an embiid/curry action and simmons added nothing to the flow of the offense."
Dwight has been the perfect big brother for this team. The whole year he would hype up Joel Embiid and defend Ben Simmons every chance he gets. He also sometimes leads workouts with the younger players and I’m sure no one told him to do that.   I’m sure Ben really appreciates this from Dwight especially after his coach threw him under the bus as well
"Kawhi played with Duncan, top 10 player of all time.  Simmons plays with Joel Embiid who is not a top 10 player of all time."
"Not sure I understand that reply lol, Joel Embiid?"
Joel Embiid doing it to make sure the focus isn’t 0-12
"embiid is likely experienced very similar treatment. I think its why there hasnt been bigger blowups and divides between them. They both been drinking the same shit.  The same people patting ben on the back about his transition offense and perimeter defense have been patting joel on the back about his feathery touch and overall offensive game.  I dont think many of those people have been criticizing bens shooting or joels conditioning (eating/body maintenance). If they had, should it have taken Joel this long?  Imagine if he was on the heat, you reckon embiid at 23 wouldnt look more like bam?  i think embiid has been lucky with how hes embraced american life and english, without that i could see him completley ignoring outside influences and never really challenging himself to step his game up.  the fact embiid seems to notice criticism and take it on board means hes been able to rise above this 'trsut the process' bubble."
"The thing that gets me is that Simmons and Embiid are both easy players to maximize.   Joel gets surrounded by shooters, and you focus on half-court execution. You never put him on the court with a non-shooter, and you will have a spectacular offense.   Ben, you make a team that plays electric defense and plays as fast as any in the league. You trust him to be the primary creator when you're in the half court(a bigger Rondo) and you pretty much never put him off-ball.   Problem is, Joel's high usage means Ben is off-ball when Joel creates his own shot, and he's useless in that regard. Joel is also a plodder, so they don't want to play at the same pace."
Fuck magic Johnson fuck all the media....joel embiid went o for 12 in 2nd half of game 5.....8 turnovers in game six and seven...Idk how many times he got posterised...Ben can score but he plays d
Embiid is literally The Process lol. The Process is on going as long as Joel is on the team
"Sure, but I feel like a handful of their players played their hearts out and Ben Simmons refused to even try a layup. So sure, you lose as a team, but when one of your centerpieces decides to just not play basketball....what more can Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers do?"
Danny is a professional. Joel Embiid is a child. We shouldn’t expect anything less from how different they handled this loss and the support of their teammates.
"""Joel Embiid gave Ben Simmons depression"""
Our team is actually well constructed this year. Brett had to find a way to play Al Horford and Joel Embiid at the same time with absolutely zero spacing. It was just setup to fail.
"What exactly was I wrong about?  My main takes were:  * Sixers aren’t actually good and will get exposed in the playoffs  Check   * Embiid will get blown out in the MVP race because of a combination of inevitable injuries and he Nuggets eventually rising in the standings, plus regression from his outlier midrange shooting in the first half   Check  * Simmons turns the offense into a 4v5 when he doesn’t have the ball and he’ll get exposed in the playoffs  Check  * Embiid is a turnover machine who can’t set up teammates and will get abused as a ballhandler in the playoffs  Check   * This Sixers core isn’t built for the playoffs   Check  * Jokic is better than Embiid and can win in the playoffs with scrubs in a way Joel can’t (unfortunately tested by Murray and Barton’s injuries)  Check  * The Sixers fucking suck and are pretenders, they haven’t proven anything and don’t deserve any respect until they do  Check   Missing anything else? That all ended up pretty much on point."
Why the fuck would the 76ers trade for Rudy Gobert when they have Joel Embiid? Gobert can’t score in the playoffs either. Did you even think about this before posting?

"Yeah I hate how people, Zach Lowe included, talk about Embiid and Simmons having a “fit” problem.   Nah the problem is Joel Embiid is one of the most versatile offensive center ever whom every superstar point guard would be dying to play with, and Ben Simmons is Ben Simmons."
"Everyone here is defending Embiid and saying it's ok. That's fine. It's an opinion to have and I see why people have it. But the problem you get into when you start publicly throwing players  or teammates under the bus is that you get to be criticized as well. The problem when your team leader does it is that it sets a tone for how the rest of the team will talk.   I understand Embiid is playing hurt, but Philly lost a game in this series 103-100 where he went 4-20 from the floor. You don't want to start that. He had 8 turnovers is a game Philadelphia lost by 7 points. You start down this line of reasoning and that same line can be used against you.      It's not because you are worried about tanking the guys value. It isn't because it is false. It isn't because Ben doesn't have some massive faults. It's because it isn't professional. It's not something good leaders do.      That goes for Doc and for Joel. They can and should be better. Neither of them are without their faults. They should both realize that."
first of all they never said those things point blank so don't make it seem like they did. What they actually did was use the underhanded way which is actually found in a lot of work environments. Joel Embiid said the turning point was when they passed up 2 points and ended up getting a lesser desired result. Doc Rivers was a little harsher and decided to not back Simmons when asking if he would be a championship caliber pointguard by completely avoiding the answer at all.  If you think those actions or words are point blank you need to grow up. They could have digged into Simmons way harder than they did as they do in the real world work environments when you fuck up. get off your moral high horse.
"I don’t know who this writer is but this take stinks. For one, he clips Embiid’s comments short and leaves out the part where Embiid said that after Trae hit the 3, they came back and it was his fault for turning it over and it snowballed. He literally outlined the sequence that led to the Hawks pulling away, and included the part where he screwed up and owned up to it. Is he just not supposed to mention the Simmons play so as not to offend his delicate sensibilities? He didn’t even call him out by name or shit talk him; he just diplomatically said they had a chance for a dunk to tie it and instead ended up with 1 pt and it snowballed from there.   It’s literally going to be one of the most meme-able plays of the last few years and he’s supposed to just not even mention it after he just played 7 hard fought games on a partially torn meniscus and had a tough loss? Why are we asking so much from these players/coaches that we almost demand they have no humanity.   Further, Doc and Joel have been vocally supportive of Ben the whole series when he was struggling. It’s clearly a mental thing for him, but by many accounts he also doesn’t work on his game to the level you’d demand out of a max player. He hasn’t improved at really any areas offensively since he entered the league. His team/coaches have literally begged for him to shoot more and shoot 3’s, and he just won’t do it.   I have had the yips before and it *sucks*, so I have sympathy for Ben to an extent. But it’s also ridiculous to expect his teammates and coach to tiptoe around the very obvious elephant in the room that Ben’s struggles are a big reason they lost and leave the question of whether they can win with him unanswered.   The author’s point about “what kind of way to instill confidence is this?” would maybe land better if Doc hadn’t talked him up all year and defended him to the press. That power of positive thinking approach didn’t do jack shit for his confidence lol; it’s not like Doc or Embiid maliciously threw him under the bus. They simply honestly answered the questions they were asked. If that’s going to shatter Ben’s confidence, he wasn’t ever going to have any in the first place. At a certain point you can have sympathy for mental struggles while still holding players accountable for improving their weaknesses.   The way for Ben to have confidence instilled is to take responsibility and work on his fucking game and improve his free throws/shooting in general, and to realize that even if he shoots poorly from the line he hurts his team when he’s not aggressive. You can build somebody up and be supportive of them without coddling them. And when you have a player as talented as Embiid who’s worked hard to improve his own game and just played through an injury, he’s well within his rights to speak freely about the game without walking on eggshells for the guy who didn’t perform or work to the same standards."
"Woah, that would be great for Philly, not too much for the other team tho. Philly might have to throw in some picks, Curry, or Joel Embiid to make that one team consider it."
"&gt;that is all the result of Morrey and Embiid  And how did the team get Embiid?   &gt;Joel Embiid being better than anyone could imagine does not validate the process.  That's the entire point of the process. I don't think you can criticise them for making bad picks but not praise them for making good ones. The idea is that you need to get super stars to win, and one of the ways to get super stars (the only way available to the 76ers at the time) is to draft them. The best place to draft them is at he top of the draft, and every pick to some degree is a roll of the dice  So take a bunch of picks at the top and one of them will probably be a superstar. It's not like the other picks were unconventional at the time, most teams in the league would have selected those players. But yeah, those other players didn't go well and that sucks, but Embiid did.   That's the outcome of the process  There's also that the team got good while accumulating picks, keeping all of their own, and owning players on good contracts. Look at the teams at the top of the league, most of them have a big lack of future assets. That's another part of the process, and were the tools that Morey used to improve the team (and were the tools that Brand wasted in his time)"
"  &gt;long term max money to two players who aren't worth the max  Do you really think Joel Embiid isn't worth a max contract?  &gt;They haven't even made a conference finals in the EAST  In 2019 they lost against the eventual champions in game 7 to a buzzer beating shot that hit the rim 4 times  They just lost in 7 while injured  But you're making the counterfactual, what would they be without these players and assets? I doubt they'd be doing better"
"I dont think you should give the Process credit for being the #1 seed that is all the result of Morrey and Embiid. Brand and the Colangelos were terrible,  but Hinkie tanked for multiple years and got 1 valuable player. Joel Embiid being better than anyone could imagine does not validate the process."
"It's time for Russell Westbrook and Joel Embiid to be friends. One of them can play center and rebound, has no problems scoring at 5ft from the basket. The other one can iso at the 3pt line and actually make threes."
"No offense guy, but you're justifying in bullshit language. You're trying to fulfill a narrative, not what actually happened.  There were some bad, sloppy turnovers that weren't him trying to make a play. You're also acting like he's a one man show, the 76ers are more than Joel &amp; Ben FYI. Nor does Embiid do most of the playmaking (Ben Simmons still had 13 assists, and even when struggling, does get guys good shots).    4 of his TOs led to 9 easy transition points (3 2s, 1 Gallo 3), 2 others were offensive fouls, 1 was a travel, and the last (his 4th TO) not sure if that led to a bucket on the other side.    He wasn't getting doubled in these turnovers, like you know the crucial one with 44 seconds left to go in a 4 point game and he gets stripped 1on1 isolated on Gallo that leads to an easy lay-up to ice the game. He wasn't being forced to make these turnovers like the mindless pass as they get out of their own half for his 2nd TO..."
"The Hawks had Lloyd Pierce as head coach until midway through the season and when Nate McMillan took over they went 27-11 and now on to the ECF. Joel Embiid had almost 60 free-throw attempts through the first 4 games, one game he had more FTA’s then all the hawks combined. You guys were blessed by the referees at almost every turn of this series, and still lost in 7. But you might just be mad that we have a point guard that can pass AND shoot and our “process” only took three years to have things turned around. Either way, off ya go."
"I've been a Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons hater since the beginning. Fuck the Process.  But Embiid proved me wrong this year. Yes he has major injury issues - - which is normal for a superstar in today's NBA schedule. And yes, I fully believe building a contender around a #1 franchise option center is a strategy that's decades behind its time.  But Embiid is not only a generational talent, he's one of the most skilled big men to ever play the game. And I think that says a lot moving forward.  What's really holding him back is Ben Simmons. That man has always been garbage. And Embiid is injuring himself carrying Ben Simmons to the playoffs."
Ahhh yes. Make a trade for another starting center when you have Joel Embiid on the roster just so you can play him in a series if Joel is hurt again.
"Obviously, Simmons isn't coming back. Joel Embiid is painfully aware of just how fleeting his time as an MVP-caliber player is going to be. Otherwise, he wouldn't have played on the injury that ended Westbrook's season in *Boom Town*. But Embiid also seems to understand that he can't win a title with Simmons - he can't keep waiting for Ben to turn into a worthy costar, because that day is never going to come.  Zach Lowe is right: Philly's best chance at a title was 2019 - when Simmons was their *fifth* most-important offensive player. When Simmons is as important as he is to a team like this, where he and Embiid are surrounded by relatively marginal players, his performance becomes *the* X-factor. Even though Harris *sucked* in this game, and Thybulle cracked up on a dagger three, and Curry finally lost his brother's anointing, the entire season hinged on Simmons making a play that he's made hundreds, if not thousands, of times in his life. Embiid knew that immediately. You can see the exact moment his eyes - *our* eyes - opened, and the entire city realized that they could have been finalists three years ago if not for the 235-pound ghost haunting the point position.  Trading Simmons for an All-Star, or even a borderline All-Star, seems like a joke at this point. In the best-case scenario, the Sixers deal him for a package of solid contributors who can hit shots around Embiid. Really, though, just getting off that contract would be a win. If Philly deals Simmons and a first-round pick for, like, Kevin Love and Colin Sexton, they'll immediately be better off than they are right now. (Don't underestimate Kevin Love on a good team.) If they trade Ben to a team with cap space, and get back a pick, or a minimum-contract scrub, or a pair of 7th-man role players, that's still an improvement, because the contracts and the expectations will be short and modest, and we can make one last magical Embiid run in '23.  Being a GM is hard, and I am no such thing. But one thing is sure: Embiid, and Doc Rivers, and everyone else has seen the truth and smelled the coffee. They don't want Simmons any more, and Simmons knows they don't want him anymore. For that reason alone, Philly has *got* to get off this contract sooner rather than later.  EDIT: If you haven't read Sam Anderson's *Boom Town*, you need to go to your local library next chance you get and fix that."
"Well I was judging based on our series, Embiid needed rest or he suffered later due to his frame, and it didn't seem only based on the meniscus(Obv hard to say, maybe he's fine). Whenever Doc put Howard or a lineup without Joel in, that's when we started to get hot due to a lack of defensive anchor and then sometimes that would carry over when Joel came back. Having Turner lock down the paint while your other DPOTY candidate is resting would be a huge boon, and they prob woulda beat us. Brogdon on top and you are shoring up a ton of your weaknesses."

"You haven't posted a single comment in our discussion that's not funny.  &gt;bro stop we won  So? I've been here after winning and after losing, I don't talk differently depending on what the Bucks did.  &gt;Giannis has a much, much better situation than Joel. And up until now had been kind of a choke artist.  Embiid has lost 4 times in a row without making the ECF, Giannis just made the ECF for the 2nd times last 3 years. But he's ""been a choke artist"" lmao. The criticism Embiid got after losing to the Raptors compared to what Giannis got for losing to the same team was nothing. And Embiid, again, averaged 17 points on like 38%FG - he lost with a better team, was worse, and still didn't get criticized nearly as much.  &gt;this is a bad look. We won, and people are respecting Giannis  Stop saying we won, nobody cares. People would be shitting on Giannis had we lost, even though he scored 30+ in 6 of the 7 games, he wouldn't get the ""Jrue was bad"" excuse. Also, we're gonna say the fuck we want - the fact we share a flair doesn't mean you'll dictate what Bucks fans can or can't say.  Lastly, you probably weren't here some days ago after game 5 when the whole sub was shitting on Giannis because he turned the ball over down the stretch. Embiid just had 16 turnovers in back to back elimination games but... ""Simmons"".  In any case, you aren't our dad. You don't get to tell us if we should or shouldn't talk shit. You're free to change your flair if you think it's a bad look for you when we do that."
"How come Embiid gets a pass in all of this? His conditioning is shit, he gets hurt often, and he’s soft. Biggest flopper in the league after Marcus smart.  He’s a big mouth loser that never beat anyone but it’s Brett Brown’s fault, or Doc’s, or Harris’, or Simmons. Embiid is the anchor right? The best player on the team? The face of the franchise? Always puts it on others. Joel got a bit of Dwight Howard in him."
"Thankfully, Brook Lopez is no Joel Embiid.  Different team, different players, we'll see how it plays out."
"That's fair. Sorry if I lumped you in with people who have different opinions, but I've run into a shitload of people on here recently talking shit on Jo, making up reasons why they don't like him (sportsmanship, showboating, shit talking, whatever), who I'm sure are all salivating at this move by Collins, which is far more petty and lame than anything I can recall Joel doing.  I think this is corny as fuck for a guy like Collins, maybe the fourth most important guy on his team, to do, but trash talk is fun! It's whatever! My problem is the people who hate on Embiid specifically for this type of thing and then go absolutely nuts when someone else does it. It's just hypocrisy."

"That's not ""all I got"" but how can you deny your own eyes... there's two hands on Joel's back... he has two fists full of jersey. All the other shit on your list is just good Big Man basketball. Players are jostling for position constantly like that. You're so soft. The only exception is the ""Dive at a man's legs"".  Yes, Embiid took out Collins's legs on a different play in a different game. I know you won't be convinced, because you're basketball illiterate, but I'd like to think that was less likely to happen if Joel didn't have his knee injury, so he could move more quickly and prevent himself from falling. I would have liked that to not have happened, but I believe it was an accident.  Joel doesn't exactly have the same reputation of Hawks legend Zaza of purposefully hurting people.  Obviously John got his revenge by punching Embiid in the face and chokeholding him, which I'm sure you have no problem with."
Right now they're contenders and without Embiid they're a bottom fifteen team. They'd need to make more moves for depth but Joel has been the one elevating that team all year.
"Okay, but outside of Embiid and Simmons (who were hurt during the tanking) there is literally no one from those teams left on the roster. The coach is also gone, and a new GM this past offseason. So how would that rub off on any of the players? Joel wants to win, he's not content losing and making money."
"They really should have tried harder to get Lowry. Yes, he's old, but he'd be the #2 behind Joel and Harris would do more of the scoring. Lowry is built to win now, and btw, so is Embiid. If I were the 76ers, I'd be trying to go all in now. Embiid is injury prone. You really don't know how long he'll last and how long before another dynasty forms which cockblocks the rest of the league."
"Certain players have that killer mentality of I want that shot. Trae has it. We saw yesterday Red Velvet has it. Joel Embiid has it, Seth Curry and Tyrese Maxey have it.  Giannis Antetakumpo has it.   Ben Simmons doesn't.   Antetakumpo isn't a great FT shooter. Dwight isn't a Great FT. Shaq too. But these guys were like okay whatever I'm still gonna body you in the post and my body is built to take those shots and you'll wear out faster than I do. And if they 0-2 and 1-2 and 0-3 and 1-3 or 2-3  they add up.   Simmons should have embraced Hack-A-Ben made the shots he can make and then just dominate on defense.   I'm a moron when it comes to basketball"
"I can't believe the conclusion of 'Trust The Process 'will be a team with CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Tobias Harris."
"Let's take this to another level. Look at the lottery picks for the sixers since the 2013, the beginning of the process: Nerlens Noel, MCW, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Jalil Okafor, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith. Besides Embiid and Simmons, noting but backups and out-of-the-league guys."
"That's because tanking isn't for winning; it's for getting great players, which is step 1 to winning. People look at it like ""well they didn't win so tanking doesn't work"". They got Joel Embiid out of it so it worked better than the dude who didn't tank and is losing anyway."
Free👏🏿Joel👏🏿Embiid👏🏿
"Yea but Joel Embiid is injured and still driving the team more towards a win than Ben. This is where your team mates are supposed to step up for your injured leader and you pray they take some of the burden, not make it worse a la Ben."
"I mean, Embiid is pretty damn good. Yea he can improve on himself but so can most any player. Ben Simmons has a mountain of flaws compared to Joel. There’s no way anyone should dump on an injured Embiid as the reason they lost and they definitely can’t dump on his effort, heart and work. Unlike Ben Simmons."
"I think the process (of being super extra bad for a few years and hoarding high lotto picks, etc.) is still defensible and potentially smart for certain teams/circumstances but yes Philly’s process has absolutely failed.   I lay it mostly at the feet of mediocre drafting and absolutely awful teambuilding rather than the process itself but holy shit. All that legendary losing for half a decade to walk away with Joel Embiid is crazy."
"Night and day mentality between Joel ""I have a lot of untapped potential"" Embiid and Ben ""This is who I am"" Simmons"
"If the other team had to account for 5 players on offense, he'd be able to actually post up down low, and not up beyond the elbow.  &amp;#x200B;  Joel Embiid, On the blocks, against ANYONE, its a nightmare, especially..and I know, I know..its sounds crazy, if the All Star guard can shoot the 3 at 30%."
"Simmons is about as soft and passionless as it gets in this league.  He's now played with Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, and Joel Embiid - if those guys couldn't put fire into him, Dame can't either."
"We can’t tell yet, well at least Not until Joel Embiid retires.    he IS the process."
"Like I get why people THINK his value has plummeted but it hasn’t. Sixers this year we’re predicated upon the health of Joel Embiid. Period. Saw a couple quotes during the season where Doc was defending Simmons not taking shots BECAUSE of his defensive prowess. Embiid turned the ball over like crazy and did it at some extremely inopportune moments. Was Simmons’ pass out of the easy dunk weird? Sure. But that was a sloppy ass game 7 from BOTH teams. Trae young shot  like 5/23 (wonder if that had to do with a maligned mans defense).   Injured Embiid who all the sudden can’t play the way he did ALL season because he has never taken proper physical care of himself and committed James Harden on the Rockets amounts of turnovers. Mixed with Doc Rivers, the dude who can’t close out a series to save his life. Like I get Simmons should have shot more, but to pin this whole thing on him seems egregious.   As a side note, Paul George doing well this year with no Doc Rivers after being heavily scapegoated last year.   Don’t really have a point, just frustrated with the coverage this morning."
Allen Fieldhouse is such an incredible place to watch a game. I met Joel Embiid on Mass St. in Lawrence a couple of years ago and he was way chill. Good times!
"I think they play Maxey at PG next season and they feature Ben all over the 3-4-5 depending on who is on the floor and then dump him before the trade deadline.   Next year is going to be wasted getting rid of Simmons, and we will have wasted another year of Embiid's prime.  Also Embiid is not blameless in all this. He stopped trusting his teammates a few games ago and has been playing hero ball on one leg. 8 turnovers on him alone last night is inexcusable. No one wants to say it but this is just as much on Joel for playing really stupid basketball than Ben for just not showing up at all.  Finally, Doc sucks. The end."
So the Sixers process’d just for Joel Embiid
"Simmons has seth curry and Joel embiid, both can knock down long range shots, and can’t get past trae young. You give him less shooting, and you think magically they’ll be better? Team A for sure."
"&gt;The sixers have to trade him not because he sucks, but because he is probably the worst offensive fit with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid. And he sucks.  People have been saying it for years, they should have traded Simmons to build around embiid  Philly didn't take the chance and look at how it's backfired now his value is at an all time low"
"It’s impractical because it’s just making things harder than they have to be for both players. Joel does his best work in the post and in the paint. He needs space to be able to work 1v1 so if someone helps he can kick out and find the open man. Ben has negative range so when defenses double Embiid, Ben is right under the rim with him because he literally can’t be a threat anywhere else."
"Yeah Joel Embiid seems to be fine in Philly. Obviously Iverson, Charles Barkley etc seemed fine. I think it may come down to Ben (and possibly Markelle) having a problem to begin with and possibly getting into a bad spiral from that which dealing with the fans may be part of."
Joel Embiid is not the problem.
Rockets don’t have Joel Embiid.
 [Joel Embiid = Ralph Wiggum](https://youtu.be/0GDA0tRftmY)
I really like embiid as a player and I think he’s a top 10 guy. So I don’t want to come off as shitting all over him cause I’m not. I just really don’t see why people would want to play with him more than anyone else which is the comment I initially replied to.   His playmaking is totally fine for a center and he’s a really good first option I just don’t think a high-profile center is that appealing to play next to in the 2021 nba landscape. Happy to be proven wrong though I want to see Joel get a chip
"I dont think they fire Doc. It's just much easier to blame it on the Ben and Embiid dynamic.  Doc is definitely stubborn and not that great at adjustments. But if you have a healthy Joel dominating and a solid point guard creating and shooting, you probably could have won this series in 6.  If I'm Philly, I'm trying to get Ben out. Gotta also think about Joel's injury history. His championship window is probably not as wide open as others.   They need to do something quick. I've been liking the Kemba for Ben ideas. Not sure I like CJ for Ben. Shit I'd probably even try John Wall for Ben at this point."
You're missing the human element. His coach and co-star just publicly blasted him. What does it say to Joel Embiid if you keep him and waste Joel's time so you can HOPEFULLY rehab his value?   This ain't 2K.
"Ben Simmons does do the little things that help a team win but none of the big stuff, like scoring, or free throw shooting, or attacking the defense. He’s the best role player in the league, which isn’t a compliment.  People are gonna act as if Ben Simmons is a negative asset which is simply untrue (until you consider contract maybe). He’s a deeply flawed player who I don’t think will get better, but he’s okay, considering he had 13 assists and played good defense. The sixers have to trade him not because he sucks, but because he is probably the worst offensive fit with Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid. And he sucks."
Tyrese Maxey was the big holdup they didn't wanna give up meanwhile Joel Embiid is wasting away his prime trying to carry those bums on a torn meniscus.
"Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid throwing Simmons under the bus last night in the post-game shows just how broken the team really was.   Simmons was bad, but he wasn’t this bad in the regular season, and has gotten worse as the pressure has gotten stronger. It’s clear his coach and star teammate didn’t have his back, and that the constant taunting from HOME fans ruptured his confidence in a way that was irreparable.  If you lose a game, and the coach and star have the knives out for a guy who was a key part of the team an hour ago, it shows the team wasn’t strong enough to win. Plain and simple. Winning teams don’t do that. Winning players don’t do that.  Suppose Philly can’t find a trade for Simmons this off-season. Now he has to start the year playing for a coach and with a teammate who publicly said he can’t hack it.  The primary reason Philly lost was Simmons’ play, but it wasn’t the only reason. Doc’s coaching and Embiid’s crunch time wilting had a huge impact as well, and them passing the buck is incredibly disappointing. The team won’t win so long as it’s key figures have that mentality, even if they ship off Simmons."
“It’s Ben or me” - Joel Embiid
"We’ve seen some big market franchises suck pretty bad. The Lakers from ‘14 to signing LeBron were bad (the worst that particular franchise has ever been), the Raptors were perpetually bad until Ujiri got there, the Rockets have stunk it up this year, the Knicks went and sucked for 2 separate 8 season stretches with like a 3 year break in the middle for Carmelo Anthony. But they at least made coherent roster moves and you can see the logic in how their rosters were *supposed* to work. They just didn’t.  No GM made a slate of selections over a 3 year period that were as incoherent as Hinkie’s and still kept their job. There was never a world where Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahlil Okafor all were supposed to coexist together on a winning roster. Hinkie was terrific at gathering draft capital, horrible at spending it at the actual draft."
"Interesting point and I'll try to look into it.  Just to note though, this season Joel Embiid shot more free throws at home (11.1 per game) than on the road (10.2) and on a higher percentage (86.7% vs. 84.9%). Which might suggest that it's unique to Ben."
"Man, I’m really not a fan of Joel Embiid and I’m glad the Sixers are out but I can’t help but feel bad for him here. He’s giving every game his all fighting through injuries and the guy who is supposed to be his co-star either forgets how to play basketball or gives up entirely"
"But what if you’re just a bad shooter? I’m sorry, but for what TH is getting paid he needs to perform better in big moments. Same with Simmons.  Hell, Joel Embiid needs to not go 0-12 in a half of basketball as a freaking center. That’s more pathetic than anything Simmons did or didn’t do this series."
Joel knew he had to try to shoulder the rest after that play.  Could see it the next few trips down the floor.  Sad thing is Embiid probably shaved off months of his career playing on a torn meniscus trying to drag Simmons bum ass through the 2nd round.
"As a Kansas fan, Embiid is pretty much the total opposite of Simmons. Joel was a fringe top 100 player before signing with Kansas, showed incredible aptitude for adding new moves and skills (on a game by game basis, it was a sight to behold), and shot up to the top of the draft board in 3 months. Simmons just coasted in college and couldn't even lead LSU to a a tournament berth in a sorry ass SEC."
It’s time for the 76ers to break up this failed experiment of a duo and choose between Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons  Judging by his postgame comments Embiid also feels the same
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
Maybe Embiid leaves and Ben stays?  Maybe Joel has had enough of the process.
"Man that turnover late in the 4th was bad by Embiid but it's also not really his fault. Embiid is extremely skilled but your Superstar Big Man shouldn't get the ball out of position as the first pass in a crucial G7 situation. Embiid imrpoved any aspect of his game but he's not Jokic, he should under no circumstance be the main ballhandler in a possession like this. And this is, in fact, again on Ben Simmons being played off the court as well as not being able to run halfcourt offense as the PG to safe his life. You're looking at the result but not the corrupt roster that lead to this situation. Embiid should fight for position to make a play out of the post because there should be 4 other guys on the court being able to handle the ball better. Situations like these should 100000% be handled by your supposedly premier playmaker, it's on Ben to be able to initiate the offense in the Clutch and not fucking Joel Embiid. Joel adjustes his game so much but expecting him to handle the ball with 1min left and initiate a play should in no way whatsoever be yet another duty of him he has to learn because he has to cover for Simmons being inherently flawed in any offensive situation that isn't transition play."
Lots of picks and anyone not Embiid or Simmons. Future picks like 3 years from now when Joel is the old Pat Ewing he is destined to be and the picks will be high.
Joel “The Process” Embiid works well. Brings a whole different meaning to “Trust the Process”.
The assassination of Joel Embiid by the coward Ben Simmons
And that's true. Joel Embiid cannot afford another season of his potentially short career stuck playing with Ben Simmons. It's just not gonna work. They're wasting time.

"How is it an awful take?  Sam Stinkie either drafted or traded for on draft night Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, and Jahil Okafor.  That’s THREE centers and no small forwards/shooting guards/point guards, and only one of them has turned into a star player.  Also, Stinkie stockpiled tons of second round picks, who in some cases become productive players.  Where are Stinkie’s really good non-lottery choices with all those extra picks?  MAYBE Sam Hinkie could have built a legitimate championship-caliber team if he had been able to see “The Process” through, but based on what he actually did I don’t think that would have happened.  One only needs to look at most of the Los Angeles Clippers’ history to see frequent high draft picks are not a guarantee of success."
"I’m just remembering what the Clips did to us in the paint the last couple games of the series, and then imagining Joel fucking Embiid doing it lol."
"Blake Griffin had Doc Rivers as his coach doe. He only played half a season with this nets and you acting like he been there for a few seasons  Chris Paul also had a good chunk of clippers playoff years coached by Doc Rivers and was injured in his only conference final.   Joel Embiid has made playoffs 3 times but you can't tell me it's his fault when his teams literay decide to choke when it matters most. Yes Embiid had some bad games against the Hawks, but he was playing on an injured knee with no support from anyone other then Curry  Paul George. Did you forget how Doc Rivers was the coach of this clippers team last year and choked a lead in the 2nd round? All of a sudden they get a new coach, lose a key player to injury and they still move on. Like huh?"
"I mean, his only playoffs appearance without Simmons he got swept by the celtics and this team is that with worse defense and Simmons actually won playoff games without embiid. In fact Simmons won regular season games regularly without embiid and Joel barely won ever without Ben. I just hope we get a star who will not be shy or shit under pressure in the 4th, because Simmons is the both, Harris is the former and embiid is the latter."
"I would say it was pretty pathetic. You don't do that in sports, or in life in general.  While Rivers was not so blunt and was asked directly about it..  Joel doing it was rather poor taste... I really like Embiid, but that's not the way leader behaves."
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
"I'm not.  Joel just played through this series with a torn knee.  He gave EVERYTHING he had, risked his future, to push for the ECF and Finals.    Instead of playing the Bucks, he got to watch his #2 average single digits and pass up a WIDE OPEN dunk to tie the game.    Not to mention he missed more free throws than the entire Suns team.    Embiid kicked and dragged this team all season only to watch Ben do his best Shaq impression at the line.  Ben just doesn't have it and Embiid is finally done covering for him."
"Yeah embiid trying a spin move and turning it over for the 8th time was not a good basketball play. It’s kind of funny honestly, game 4 Joel goes 0/12 in the second half and people blamed Simmons, game 5 Joe went 1/7 in the 4th, missed two key free throws down 1, and a go ahead open layup with 7 seconds on the clock, and also had 8 turnovers, and people blamed Simmons again (this was way more justified and when I personally gave up on Simmons), and then today Simmons doesn’t go for the dunk but still lays it off and thybulle gets 2 shots, then ben was off the floor and joel completely threw the game away with shit decisions and thybulle made a catastrophic error fouling on the 3 point line, which was the actual turning point, and Simmons gets roasted by the coach and embiid. It would be funny if it weren’t disastrous for our future. Hope we get a solid pg and embiid stays healthy, and that pg learns to *never* trust embiid with closing a game."
"Simmons with +1 and 13 assists, while Embiid leading with the turnovers and -2, and Harris 8/24, but yeah, it's on Simmons, lol. Next year they'll fail again without Simmons, because the problem is the big spoiled baby Joel."
"I can’t blame Joel even with his blunders. We have to run the offense through Embiid getting doubled in the paint because it’s somehow still the best option. Embiid had some very un-clutch moments in game 7 and 5, but he’s been carrying us all series, playoffs, and season. The man is exhausted, playing on one leg, carrying our offense, and dealing with double and triple teams on every single play. He shouldn’t be asked to do what he’s had to do, no one else can create a shot."
"After all the agonizing over whether Ben Simmons can fit next to Joel Embiid on offense, it’s kind of funny that it’s all come down to “maybe Ben Simmons can’t fit on offense, period.” Turns out it was a real one way problem (especially considering Joel adding stuff like a 3 point shot himself to accommodate Simmons).  Wonder what the 76ers can get for Simmons if they try to trade him. The playoffs were such a disaster for him, I’m curious if it hurts his value significantly as a trade piece. Probably not in talks for a near-straight swap for Harden now, at least."
[Joel Embiid mood rn](https://youtu.be/GqVRLgxCngk?t=64)
"i mean i would've said the exact same thing about a team with joel embiid, ben simmons, jimmy butler, and tobias harris a couple of years ago. the astros also whiffed hard on their draft picks. mark appel and brady were two of their three #1 overall picks and never played an MLB game for them, which is exceedingly rare for a #1 overall pick in MLB.  it's also tough to compare across sports because tanking in MLB doesn't really do much since the draft is such a crapshoot anyway. there's really no benefit to losing 110+ games at all. you're better off signing project free agents and then trading them at the deadline or holding them if they're any good than you are just completely shedding all salary to bottom out."
"And that's why they call him Joel ""Do a 180"" Embiid."
"Less about Embiid, more about Tobias. 2 guys who mainly score at the rim is fine, but add 3 to the mix and you’ve got issues in today’s game.   Ben and Joel have been good with high volume shooters around them. Tobias may be be an efficient 3 point shooter but only on 3 attempts a game and will give up open 3’s to operate in the midrange or post  If Tobias can increase his 3pt volume while sharing the floor with Ben and Joel and save his post and mid range scoring till one of them sits, the Sixers would likely look better."
"as someone who has watched every game Ben Simmons has played as a pro. Nothing bothers me more than Ben sitting in the dunker spot during an Embiid Post up...  &amp;#x200B;  My guy get out of the lane, your man is doubling Joel....  Yet the media focuses on Embiid shooting 3s.... because Ben can't get points if Embiid is in the post every time."
MVP: Joel Embiid   DPOY: Thybulle/Giannis   ROTY: Jalen Suggs   MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.   6MOY: Jordan Clarkson
"MVP: James Harden, Nets will steamroll the NBA and Harden's stats will look better than KD's  DPOY: Joel Embiid, with Simmons gone and the Sixers will still have a great defense, but with one less person to split the votes  MIP: OG Anunoby, idk, i saw someone else say him and it sounded good  ROY: Cade Cunningham, i think there will be a lot of candidates, but there's like only one other offensive option on the Pistons  6MOY: Dennis Schroder, dude will be on a mission to get paid and the C's will rely on him A LOT. I think he will be incredibly productive coming off the bench with Horford in the PnR/PnP"
"[The 25-year-old has been struggling with tendinitis in his left knee since the All-Star break, which forced him to miss 14 of the final 24 games of the regular season.](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/othersport/1120706/Joel-Embiid-knee-injury-tendonitis-Philadelphia-76ers-NBA-Playoffs-Toronto-Raptors)  Which is a degenerative injury that must constantly be treated and managed. same shit Kawhi has.  And he has had back issues since he came into the NBA."
"Joel Embiid if he stays healthy, and whomever his entourage is.."
"Simmons value will always be, awkward because it the shooting and his attitude   But right now a team is looking at an elite inside outside defender, a low primary, high secondary ball handler, and a consistent rebounder. He’s good, but not next to a (understandable) ball stopper like embiid. He needs a more fluid offense, and with a player like embiid, the best option will always be to run it through Joel not Ben   T-Wolves should be all over him, but I think they’re waiting for Morey to crack. This is a horrible look for him, and if those trade rumors about him asking for the farm are true, most GMs are probably sick of him and his bad faith deals"
"Joel Embiid post-up or Tobias Harris post-up, sick!"
"Hi Daryl. Bob Myers here. Best I can do is Wiggins for salary, plus any combination of the following that add up to 7  * Kuminga = 4 * Wiseman = 3 * Moody = 1 * 1st round pick (max 3) = 1 * 1st round pick swap (max 3) = 0.5  Now, Daryl, you may be thinking to yourself, ""What good does any of this do me if I have Joel Embiid and our goal is to win a championship?"" I'd in turn ask you, ""What good is Ben doing for you sitting at home taking paycuts to watch reruns of *Keeping Up with the Kardashians*, or even worse, getting out there, walking up and down the court, chucking a few halfcourt shots, and passing the ball to the other team a la Kevin Love in Cleveland, meanwhile Joel and Doc and everyone else have to answer constant questions about this whole fiasco everyday?"" I assume Doc would bench Ben if he were acting up, but what's the difference between benching Ben and benching our guys, except that our guys will be less of a headache?  Think about it."
"There’s just as many superstar big men that get their own. Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Jokic are all superstar bigs. Then you have Gobert who is one of the best defenders and leads the league by a HUGE margin of advanced metrics like defensive raptor.   But yeah Mj would definitely adapt."
Joel Embiid
"My comments are not meant to disrespect harden so I apologize.  I am a huge fan of his game and thinks he gets unfairly criticized by too many people.  What I meant to convey was that there are times when it appears as if harden is not in peak athletic condition.  And even with this, he destroys people on the court.  If he took lebrons approach and invested in taking care of his body he would be the best player in the world.  Joel embiid is similar; you saw how good he was this season.  He was in shape relatively healthy all season. You could see from game 1 that he was in shape and that he had dedicated his off season to his conditioning.  Again, I’m not hating on harden. He deserves to train how he wants to and he clearly is successful with his approach."
"Giannis would literally run through them. Joel Embiid makes it harder but in the post-season the Bucks have 3 of the best 4 players if Khris Middleton continues being a closer and Jrue playing D on the prime perimeter scorer - which the Sixers don’t have a reliable one besides Tobias, who is as streaky or streaker than Khris"
Joel Embiid  How much fried food do you eat on a regular basis?
Joel Embiid when he’s retired lol
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
I saw Bol Bol has Joel Embiid Ceiling after the draft
"It's interesting that Joel Embiid never played in conference finals, but many have him being better than Jokić.  Last season Embiid without his second best player (even though it might be Harris) got swept in the first round against Celtics.  Jokić this season without his second best player (who had two 50 point games last season) and other two best guards. Went to the second round with these starting guards: a 30 year old rookie from Argentina and a previous 10 day contract player who wasn't picked up by ANYONE in months before Denver got him.   Embiid's biggest achievement was going 7 in semifinals with a damn near superteam consisted of Simmons, Butler, Harris and Embiid. And going 7 against a team they were heavily favored against, also a team playing in the playoffs for the first time.   We can talk about teammates not being good enough, but it doesn't change the fact that Embiid hasn't been able to reach conference finals in an obviously easier conference.   Also he threw his teammate under the bus after the game, while Jokić said he wasn't good enough and it's on him.   Not to mention"
"CJ Mcollum, Nurk and Zach Collins corpse for Joel Embiid."
"If they were able to trade Simmons for harden at the start of the season they would probably be champions right now. We all know via capella what harden can do with a competent big, now multiply that by 5 with prime Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Danny green and a good supporting cast"
"Uhhhh no. I'm going to name 11 guys, and then ask how the fuck you justify ranking Devin Booker ahead of any of them (in no particular order):  1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3.

I hope Joel Embiid joins this list be can possibly
Giannis is very likable because he isn’t a cocky ass that hasn’t done shit like Joel Embiid
You can't teach or learn killer instinct. Joel Embiid had it at the same age.

You have a Joel Embiid flair
"Giannis ""Joel Embiid"" Antetokounmpo"
"You're right but for some reason it's never acknowledged. I consistently see people say that kawhi is a worse defender than he used to be because he's slowedbdown and his offensive load is too much to manage with top tier defense added on (which are valid reasons), but when Giannis is playing some of the best defense of his life and scoring 32 a game with 13+ rebounds added on in the NBA FINALS, it's somehow worse than kawhi.  Everyone's gonna bring up clutch stats most likely or some other thing, but Giannis is simply the better player based on their recentish performances.  Personally I'd go  1. Giannis  2a. Kevin durant 2b. Kawhi 3a. Jokic 3b. Curry  4. Joel embiid  5. Lebron  Any of the a's or b's can go either way based on preference"

Joel embiid
Joel Embiid could be so dominant if he weren't so injury-prone. I think that he needs to change the way he moves his body on the floor.
He is considered [day-to-day](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/joel-embiid-out-sixers-game-5-against-wizards?cid=Yahoo&amp;partner=ya4nbcs) which means he could return if Washington forces a Game 6 and 7.
Joel “Street Clothes” Embiid
"Joel “Street Clothes” Embiid    That’s how it works, right?"
"[[Charania] 76ers’ Joel Embiid has a small meniscus tear in his right knee, team says. He is day-to-day.](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1400135497461215235?s=19)"
"People get on Embiid for the number of calls he gets, but if this play is even remotely close to a foul then Joel should be going to the line 20+ times a game lol. You are right- the contact on post-ups and interior shots is for some reason called completely differently than contact on guards shooting from the perimeter. It's stupid.  A foul is a foul. This play is not a foul."
Joel Embiid.  Ben is content to do all the other stuff on the court and let Embiid fill up the scorers sheet.   I'd have been fascinated to see Ben with the keys to the offense in Houston. I've got no doubt he could average 20+ pts if he was asked to take a leading role.
"He was probably the closest to the hype Lebron had as a prospect. He was hyped throughout HS and took Ohio State to the NCAA final. Put up 25pts, 12 Reb, 4 blocks on a Al Horford/J. Noah front court that had decided to to run it back after winning the whole thing the year before.  Shaq and Tim Duncan had also won 8/9 of the most recent championships, so bigs were valued at a premium.  (Rasheed Wallace/Ben Wallace was the other front court )      He’s also probably the reason Joel Embiid didn’t go #1 despite being the best prospect that year."
“Tradition” is a tough thing to define in the modern NBA. The NBA goes through what could be called eras or generations. This era is all about shooting and getting lots of possessions. Defense has taken a big back seat to the offense. I would pick the Sixers because we play different than everyone else with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.
Harden is the Nets shooting guard like Joel Embiid is the Sixers power forward.
"From Kyle Neubeck’s article in the *Philly Voice:*  &gt; To some degree, the latest update was forced by league guidelines — the Sixers were required to submit a report for tomorrow's game by Tuesday's 5 p.m. deadline, and were only comfortable calling him doubtful for the time being as they figure out where to go from here.  &gt; The good news, a source close to the situation told PhillyVoice, is that the Sixers feel good about the ability to manage Embiid's health from a long-term/overall playoff perspective. Information beyond that, though, has been murky.  &gt; https://www.phillyvoice.com/joel-embiid-doubtful-game-5-vs-wizards-knee-injury-status-latest/"
"This is a slightly more optimistic quote from the article:  &gt; The good news, a source close to the situation told PhillyVoice, is that the Sixers feel good about the ability to manage Embiid's health from a long-term/overall playoff perspective.

"We lost one game, relax.   Also he was healthy last year, we didn’t have Simmons and had the corpse of Al Horford and Tobias that’s why we lost  He was healthy the year before when we lost to the raptors. We lost because we didn’t have a good backup and we were -10,0000,0000 when he sat.   Joel has never been the reason we lost in the playoffs. He gets banged up and plays through it, recall masked Embiid.   You can’t be a fan, because it has literally never been true that the reason we lost in the playoffs was an Embiid injury."
Yes I'm pretty sure he is hes kinda a like Joel Embiid of the wast even tho their play style is different.  I I'm sure hes is idolize outside Denver.
I don’t know if comparing Philly’s 7/8 guys to Atlanta’s is really a good argument.  Atlanta is tough nosed and talented down the roster.  With the Hawks being the 3rd most injured team this year 5+ guys have had to be the number 2 option throughout the season at different points.  They have all had big moments and performances necessary to get the hobbled hawks to their next win.   The advantages that Philly has over Atlanta is length and speed on defense and specifically Joel Embiid.  That’s about it.  Joel is probably the most effective two way player in the league and will disrupt Atlanta’s pick and roll as well as put up big numbers on offense.  Physically speaking only another freak of nature can go toe to toe with him and take him out of his game.
"Can’t post the charts put here’s the text if you don’t wanna click:  Damian Lillard had reason to believe that Portland’s fans would make a difference in his first-round series against the Nuggets.   The Trail Blazers were the last NBA team to start allowing fans into their home arena this season—much to Lillard’s chagrin. But once they did, the Trail Blazers went 4-0 in home games with fans, including crucial wins over the Lakers and Nuggets that helped Portland avoid the play-in tournament.    The Ringer’s NBA Odds Machine  So good, it should come with a spoiler alert  Moreover, Portland has seemingly benefited from an extreme home-court advantage in recent playoff history. From 2013-14, Lillard’s first postseason, through 2018-19, the last postseason before the home-court-free bubble, the Trail Blazers were a miserable 6-21 on the road in playoff games—but against those same teams at home, they were a much better 13-11. That gap represented one of the largest home-court advantages in the league.   So in advance of Game 3 in the Blazers’ first-round series, with the Moda Center allowing four times the capacity that it did during the regular season, Lillard conveyed confidence in his home crowd. “We know that our crowd is loud, our crowd has pride, they really care, and they gonna come ready,” Lillard said. “I know that’s going to play in our favor.”  And then the Trail Blazers lost Game 3 in front of those loud, prideful, caring fans, before winning Game 4 to salvage a split at home—just as they’d split the two games in Denver to open the series. It turns out neither team’s home-court advantage mattered at all.  But it’s not just Lillard, and it’s not just Portland vs. Denver. Across the league, home-court advantage has disappeared in this postseason—even as fans flock to arenas in their greatest numbers since the start of the pandemic, and even as players, coaches, and owners express excitement to play in front of the cheering masses once again.   “It’ll be pretty special for our fans, just to have our fans in the building and make us proud,” LeBron James said before the first Lakers’ home playoff games in eight years, and his first in Los Angeles. “That’s what I came here for, is to play a playoff game in front of the Lakers faithful.”  Except like Lillard’s Trail Blazers, LeBron’s Lakers split their two home games—just as they’d split their two road games in Phoenix. Home-court advantage didn’t matter one bit.  Through 32 playoff games thus far, two home and two road for each club, home teams are 16-16. In the 16-team playoff era, home teams’ winning percentage has never been close to this low—except last year, in the bubble, when “home-court advantage” by definition didn’t exist.    The same is true for point differential, rather than pure win-loss record. Historically, home teams have won their playoff games by an average of four to five points per game—but this postseason, that average is down to 0.9 through 32 games, in line with the bubble playoffs (1.0) for the lowest by far.    Typically, the NBA’s home-court advantage is one of the strongest across the major North American sports, and it tends to increase in the postseason. From the expansion of the postseason bracket to 16 teams in 1983-84 through the 2018-19 season, home teams won 61 percent of their games in the regular season and 65 percent of their games in the playoffs. (That pattern holds even accounting for the fact that better teams play more home games in the playoffs. FiveThirtyEight’s Neil Paine calculated the same playoff boost of 4 percentage points even with this adjustment.)   But this postseason has been different. Since the introduction of the shot clock, 88 best-of-seven series before this season had started with the home teams winning four games in a row. For comparison, only six had started with the road teams winning four games in a row, meaning a home sweep of games 1 through 4 was 15 times more likely than a road sweep. Yet this year, no series started with four home wins in a row, while Clippers-Mavericks saw four consecutive road wins.  That’s just one data point, but it sure fits the larger pattern.  Best-of-Seven Series to Start With Four Road Wins  2021 First Clippers Mavericks ???  2017 First Celtics Bulls Celtics 4-2  2005 First Mavericks Rockets Mavericks 4-3  1995 Conference Finals Spurs Rockets Rockets 4-2  1994 Second Rockets Suns Rockets 4-3  1969 First Lakers Warriors Lakers 4-2  1963 Conference Finals* Celtics Royals Celtics 4-3  *Unlike the other series in this chart, which used the standard 2-2 format for the first four games, the Celtics and Royals alternated home courts for every game of their 1963 series. The sudden diminishment of home-court advantage could wreak unexpected effects on this postseason. Game 7s might not favor the home team as much as usual, for instance, and the presumed powerhouse clash between the Nets and Bucks in the second round might not hinge on the Nets’ home-court advantage. The Lakers could win the title without hosting Game 1 in any round.   It’s still early in the playoffs, so the advantage could still tilt back toward the home teams in a Game 7, or in later rounds. And all this analysis comes with the caveat that injuries to stars have seemingly affected teams more at home thus far: Donovan Mitchell missed a home game for Utah; Anthony Davis missed half a home game for the Lakers; Kemba Walker and Robert Williams missed the same home game for Boston. (Injuries do go both ways, though: The 76ers’ Joel Embiid missed most of Game 4, helping Washington to a home win.)  Yet this phenomenon fits with a recent trend in the regular season, too. From 1984 through 2013, home teams’ winning percentage in the regular season never dipped below 60 percent leaguewide for more than one season in a row. But it’s been below 60 for eight regular seasons in a row now—reaching an all-time low, of course, this season, when most games had no crowds at all.    ESPN’s Kevin Pelton found that home-court advantage was stronger in games with fans this regular season, but in the postseason, teams with more fans aren’t benefiting from the extra crowd size. In fact, the correlation between attendance and home point differential is negative-0.22 so far, meaning more fans are associated with a worse performance from the home team.   Don’t read into that figure too far. The quality of the teams allowing larger crowds somewhat scrambles this analysis—for instance, Miami could bring in 17,000 fans per home game, while Milwaukee was allotted just 9,100 in its first-round sweep. But as this graph shows, there’s also no evidence that larger crowds have helped the home team this postseason.    Crowds have helped the overall product, as players clearly enjoy competing in front of fans and the television viewing experience improves immensely with thousands of chanting, cheering mouths working in unison. (They’ve also exposed a considerably uglier side, throwing popcorn and water bottles, and hurling spit and offensive invectives toward players and their families.)  But improving the general NBA experience is distinct from improving a specific team’s chances. Consider the Clippers and Mavericks once more: After much discourse around Mark Cuban’s desire to pack Dallas’s home arena, the Mavericks found enough legislative leeway to get to more than 17,700 fans for both home games—the highest attendance for any team in the postseason. Dallas proceeded to lose both home games anyway.  As Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said before those losses, “Just because you’re home doesn’t mean you’re going to walk out there and win a game. You’ve still got to keep doing the things that you’ve been doing well in previous games   I didn’t particularly care for this article that I read"
1. Kawhi Leonard 2. James Harden 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Damian Lillard 5. Luka Doncic 6. Kevin Durant 7. Trae Young 8. Joel Embiid 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Jayson Tatum 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Lebron James 13. Ja Morant 14. Mike Conley 15. Derrick Rose
Joel Embiid. If you know his story then you know why.
"Okay.   1. Kawhi Leonard. Averaging 33 ppg on 10/21 from 3 and 2 double doubles so far  2. Luka Doncic. Averaging 33 even with only scoring 19 one game with a neck injury. Also has a triple double so far  3. Kevin Durant. Averaging 33 ppg on very efficient shooting  4. Joel Embiid. If you take out the game where he got injured and only played 11 mins, he's averaging 29 ppg with great defense  5. Jokic. 31 ppg, and 2 double doubles  6. Harden. 26 ppg and 11 assists per game so far  7. Trae Young. 27 ppg and 10 assists  8. Damian Lillard. Had one stinker where he only scored 10, but before that was averaging 37 ppg.   9. Lebron James. Not his best series, but still putting up 22 ppg and 8.5 assists  10. Giannis. In a sweep, put up 23 ppg and 15 rpg  Bonus. Both Devin Booker and Chris Paul. I didn't even mention Anthony Davis. Ayton is the fifth most impactful player in his own series"
"How does it compare to, say, the 76ers record with Joel Embiid? Or Miami with Jimmy Butler? Spread either of *those* across a full season; what does the seeding look like then?  The Hawks are a second tier team. The top tier in the East this year is Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn. The 2017 Heat went 30-11 in the second half of the season; I don’t think anyone would consider them a top tier team in the East that year just because they closed the year on a strong run. Like someone else said, it’s kind of weird to be on here begging for respect when a lot of fans (and the media) have been impressed by the way you’ve played in the postseason, as if *we’re* unreasonable for not naming the Hawks title favorites because of the way y’all have played under Nate. There’s a lot of factors that go into a full season. Should you have made the coaching change sooner? Probably. But it doesn’t come close to guaranteeing that you’d have the same winning percentage on a larger sample size."
"I said the same thing to a Celtics friend of mine. If Joel Embiid stepped on the B in a similar manner as Kyrie, I’d be hype as shit to get back at him and the team. I’d want our guys to respond back and destroy him next game.   I WOULD NOT be calling him classless and all this other nonsense because that’s just a thing that happens with sports. It’s trash talk."
"aw fuck, Joel ""It's playoffs and I'm hurt"" Embiid"
Is Joel Embiid destined to be the new Chris Paul ?  the best player at his position but always injured when the most needed...
"His name is Joel Hans ""Trust the Process"" ""Sam Hinkie died for our sins"" ""Do a 180"" Embiid."
"First of all, the Nets got beat by a very depleted Celtics team missing 3 starters with KD and Harden combining for 80 just because Kyrie had a subpar game (Yes, Tatum scored 50, but when the opposing 7th seed team is missing its 7th best player, you better win with 3 superstars, no excuses AT ALL).   Second, you’re looking too far ahead when there’s a good chance you won’t even get there. The Bucks are a much better team than the Celtics. Way better defensively and better offensively too. They are not the same team they were last year. Jrue is a much better fit than Bled. Don’t get too ahead of yourself because the Bucks are a real threat to the Nets.  Lastly, you’re underrating the Sixers a lot. Tobias is playing at an all star level this year. They massively improved the spacing around Embiid by replacing Horford with Danny Green and Seth Curry. They also have elite defenders in Ben, Matisse, and Joel and a good defender in DG to slow the Nets down.   KD and Harden will get their’s no doubt, but the only way Brooklyn has any chance is if Kyrie and Joe Harris can consistently show up. I promise you that the shitty defense of this depleted Celtics team is making the Nets look better than they really are. Y’all ain’t competing with the Bucks and Sixers physically. Kyrie has a history of shitting the bed against Giannis in the playoffs."
"Scott Brooks and Joel Embiid coincidentally driving in a car together and getting in a serious accident that incapacitated both. Aside from that, maybe if all the Phili players have an epiphany and decide to immediately retire and become shaolin monks in the mountains. Or dumb luck"
No the wizards are going to drop game five even Joel embiid doesn't play. Enjoy stroking it all summer to one playoff win
For Joel Embiid to miss the rest of the series.

"&gt;Can u tell me how to neutralize Joel embiid?  Just wait it out, he'll get injured eventually LOL  In any case, he doesn't need to be neutralized, just take Simmons out of it and essentially play 4 on 5. Simmons plays = hack-a-Simmons all day and take away easy points. Simmons out = stagnant offense for the entire team.  Win-win for the Bucks/Nets and even the Hawks"

Can u tell me how to neutralize Joel embiid?
"If Embiid plays, just put a 5th string on the court and have him take take 6 fouls against Simmons to start the game. Make Joel use all his energy on defense. The repeat with 3-5 more useless bench players.  Theyve got 15 guys and they only use 9 anyways. Thats 31 (36-5 to get in bonus) possessions they can force Ben to shoot without letting the 76ers even get their offense started and in rhythm.  Edit: also, at the end of the first quarter, none of your starters will be in foul trouble unless they commit a bunch of charges or moving screens"
Joel Embiid didn’t play
Everyone’s talking about the Hack-A-Ben effect but no ones talking about the No-Joel-Embiid effect
now all eyes are on the Joel Embiid health tweets
Bro Enes Kanter with defense is like Joel Embiid lol. Enes Kanter has been in top 10 PER for many years because his offense is so dominant.
That's the type of dunk you pull off knowing Joel Embiid cannot hurt you anymore tonight.
To have sex with joel embiid
Does anyone really think Joel Glass Man Embiid can survive a long run to the Finals and beyond?
You are way more likely to find another Jayson Tatum than Joel Embiid. So build around Joel Embiid
I’d rather build around the better player which is Joel embiid
"Against the nets in his sophomore year, against Miami in his rookie year.  Ben has lost two play off series  1) against Celtic as a rookie and he had two ok games and two bad ones  2) raptors in his sophomore series and he was ok in that series.  Hardly a reason to be assume he is crap.  Simmons has only ever looked like a star when embiid is not playing, but wins more when playing with Joel..  don't think sacrificing to get wins equals crap player"
i wonder who’d win in a fight between AD and joel embiid since both are fragile asf
"God, I love Joel Embiid."
I think Kenny tripped over a broom trying to twist his way out of saying Joel Embiid is really fucking good and shows glimpses of past greats like Hakeem Olajuwon.  Finish them off boys and have a few days off.
Joel Embiid best 1 on 1 player I ever seen in my life
"Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, Danny Green, RoCo, JJ Redick, Saric, Richardson, Thybulle, Dwight.......and also some guy named Joel Embiid  Like, I'm sure Dallas has had some nice pieces but it's not comparable"
"Win some lose some. Oh well. As Joel Embiid said, it’s lame to only talk shit when you’re up"
DeAndre Hunter is going to guard Joel Embiid?
"76ers-Jrue Holiday, Seth Curry, Andre Iguodala, Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid,"
"The point was pace don’t mean shit. This a 7 game series and you over here talking about some damn “but they were on pace to” no, they were missing their second best player when it mattered. What they did previously was irrelevant.   Lakers lost their second best player in a damn elongation game and a hampered lebron who even said he didn’t feel 100%  Now you playing a team without it’s best player and without Zu who’s been playing well for them. No Serge either   So What have we learned this post season about the Suns? That they can beat injured teams? Nothing you said changes anything it just sounds like excuses(poor ones at that)   And if you were smart, you should of mentioned a hampered Joel embiid, instead of bringing up a perfectly fine and healthy  Ben Simmons lol."
*Joel Embiid has left the chat.*
"Fucking hell, ZUABC PLAYED WHILE HE'S INJURED IN GAME 4.  Blake Griffin played while he's injured in the 2019 Playoffs.  Anthony fucking Davis played while being injured in the first round.  You dumb as shit. You could absofuckinglutely play while you're injured.  Edit: Even Joel Embiid played while he's injured against the Hawks."
"Joel Embiid has a pretty good 3pt shot, especially for a center, but I think I read somewhere that KAT is the best-3pt-shooting center in history."
"My argument is that your position that we should blow it up is stupid as hell. In the last three years this team has outperformed Philly twice and the one year we didn’t was a year we had zero home games, no centre and you guys peaked again at a second round game 7 loss. It’s hilarious you’re telling someone else to blow it up when an MVP caliber performance from Joel Embiid was needed just to drag the rest of your roster to the rarified heights of the second round. Again, I genuinely don’t know how you expect anyone to take your argument seriously"
He’s gonna get those Joel embiid painkillers and be ok
"I'm still on the fence about going for Simmons, but Embiid and KAT are different animals.  KAT loves the 3 ball and Embiid is more traditional. Joel can step out and make 3's, but it's not on KATs level (volume and %). Alternatively, the Wolves don't have Embiid to anchor the defense, so anything Simmons can bring on that end is a sight for sore eyes."
"You're dumb and making the rest of us look bad.  We will happily give the Blazers any and all players not named Joel Embiid, draft picks, coaching staff, etc. for Damian Lillard.  Morey will personally rent a 15 seat van and drive the entire team to the airport."
"Even if that is the case, you have a franchise player to build around post-Embiid. Everyone else is going to bounce when Joel begins to slow down, from Simmons to Lillard to the Rubio/Beasley packages. You guys would be in much better shape than when Iverson left and the team was turned over to Iggy"
\&gt; With the caveat that you can’t use players who won titles for your team  PG: Allen Iverson  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Andre Iguadola  PF: Charles Barkley  C: Joel Embiid
Brandon Ingram.  Joel Embiid.  Victor Oladipo.
"You're still not getting it. If Ben could do more on offense instead of just handing the ball over and watching, Embiid might not find himself in situations where he needs to make so many passes.   Simmons's lack of offense is the reason Embiid has to do this shit.  Also, are you actually saying the 76ers losing lies more with Joel than it does with Ben?"
*nods in Joel Embiid*
It’s ok Joel Embiid you don’t have to use burner accounts to trash Trae. This is a safe place
He also didn’t play with Joel Embiid in the eastern conference.
Joel Embiid has left the chat
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
I would like to nominate Joel Embiid
"It doesn’t really matter.   He plays the 5 a lot in the playoffs. Regular season I don’t want an injury prone guy banging down low with Joel embiid and nikola jokic every night idgaf if he’s the goat center, this sounds like a recipe for a bigger injury than he usually gets.  He plays center when it counts, not vs the heat on a Tuesday night in February."
Take Simmons and whatever else u want apart from Maxey and embiid I'd love to have dame on this team him and Joel would be unstoppable
"Honestly I can (sort of) understand ben wanting out of Philly, and not feeling the need to be who Philly wants him to be. What does honestly confuse me though is like... he is committed to real money. He has a huge contract. Like he will be suspended and fined more money than I will make in my whole life. He doesn't get that for free. He gets that to play ball. Who is going to want to commit $100Million dollars to someone who can just get their feelings hurt over the truth and fuck you over. Because that is what hes doing. Hes fucking them. How many years does Philly have of prime embiid left? If this trade is managed poorly then it could mean that joel spends his whole prime with a B quality team. And I dont see why someone would send high quality for this version of Ben."
“Sources say Olshey refuses to trade CJ for anything less than Joel Embiid”  Basically the reverse of dumbass Morey holding out for Dame
"Joel Embiid literally said that he felt that the turning point of game 7 was when they had a layup and ended with a FT. I couldn't be Ben Simmons in that situation, i would've legit said that i thought the turning point of the game was when my center had eight turnovers and my 200 million small forward shot 8-24 from the field in the most important game of the year.  Harris played like absolute horse shit in Games 5 and 7, Embiid was turning the ball over as if he was Russell Westbrook, but despite all of that the entire organization blamed all on Simmons."
"Doc Rivers Game 1 Pregame Speech:  Can you smell it? There's a life force in here tonight. Do you feel it? I look around this room and I see potential.  [to Seth Curry] I see the future chairman of a Fortune 500 company.  [to Andre Drummund] I see a famous rap artist.  [to Joel Embiid] I see the President of the United States of America.  Seth Curry:  He's from Cameroon.   Doc:  Being an only child,educated entirely by private tutors my whole life,I'm looking forward to interacting with children like Ben Simmons for the first time.  I'm gonna teach you,and I bet you might teach me a little something also.  Now, those of you from western Pennsylvania probably know my father, Doc Rivers senior, the ""lighting fixture"" king.  All the lights you'll see around this arena have been donated by him.  But I'm gonna do old Dad one better.  I'm not gonna give you a light.  I'm gonna show you the light!  And to help me do it, let's meet the new coaching staff of the 76ers!"
"1. Anthony Davis, $32,742,000 2. Steven Adams, $29,592,695 3. Nikola Jokic, $29,542,010         3. Joel Embiid, $29,542,010         5. Kristaps Porzingis, $29,467,800         5. Karl-Anthony Towns, $29,467,800  7. Andre Drummond, $28,751,774 8. Al Horford, $27,500,000 9. Nikola Vucevic, $26,000,000 10. Rudy Gobert, $25,775,281 11. LaMarcus Aldridge, $24,000,000           Look me in the eye and tell me that maxing a center doesn't come without risk."
We might see Joel Embiid commit murder during the game and no one would stop him at this point.
"An out of context Embiid quote and Doc Rivers being a moron aren't why this happened. He would have asked for a trade regardless of Doc's thing, that explanation is just post-hoc justification for his behavior, to suggest otherwise is disengenous. Philly shopped him for one player before he demanded a trade - James Harden, who happens to be a top 5 player in the NBA.  The Sixers have a narrow window to win a chip; Morey knows this. They're asking him to help rehab his value because he's the only piece they have.   He's behaving like a spoiled child, because he is one and the organization has treated him like one for five years. The Sixers and our fanbase has treated Ben better than any other fan base has. Other teams and writers were writing for him to be traded because he wouldn't fit with Joel after his first year, mocking his shooting hand, etc. To act like the Sixers are the bad guys in the Ben relationship just takes agency away from a grown man that has been paid nine figures of income."
"To play devils advocate, doubling down on not trading Ben was not the precursor to this mess of a situation. Throwing Ben under the bus following an emotional playoff loss, with Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid not backing Ben up publicly created this situation.  If the 76ers intent was to keep him, they should have publicly backed him and instructed Doc and Embiid to express their support for Simmons while he was getting massive backlash. If you’re Simmons, why play for a coach and the team’s best player if they themselves don’t believe in you? When things got tough, they abandoned him and are now trying to backtrack."
"Neither Rivers or Embiid put the loss on Ben.  They both said some things that weren't nice about Ben but Joel literally said he was a problem, too, that the team didn't step up. Rivers was asked whether Simmons could be a championship PG and he said I don't know.  Neither one came close to blaming the loss on Ben."
All-Fuck-Simmons 1st Team  Trae Young | Kevin Huerter | Kawhi Leonard | Jayson Tatum | Joel Embiid
"He is handling this exactly how anyone would expect. Doc Rivers, Embiid and Danny Green literally called Ben Simmons out consistently in the media after the Hawks series, he has no respect for these people.  He is doing his best Marshawn Lynch impression of being there to not get fined, he was probably glad that Doc told him to go home. Joel Embiid by the way, 8 turnovers in Game 7 against the Hawks and averaged nearly 5 a game in that series, still acted like Ben was the only reason they lost.  I really don't know what the hell the Sixers FO and Doc Rivers expected."
Joel Embiid Get on the scale!
Joel may have risen above AI for me after this presser. God I love him.  - My wife  - my kids  - Joel Hans Embiid
If Joel stands anywhere near the paint Ben would score 0 points. He won’t dunk over Trae Young but he’s going to take it to the rim against Embiid? I don’t think so
"Lol if Ben gets traded I’m definitely pulling for y’all as soon as  (and obviously if) the hawks are eliminated. It was fun being like “Embiid is a flopper! We killed the process!” But at this point I just feel bad for doc and joel. We didn’t kill the process, Ben did holy shit"
“At this point I don’t care about that man. He does whatever he wants”. - Joel Embiid
I’m so glad embiid is getting his shine for this. Joel had to grind to get to this point and it seems that Ben has been given a silver spoon all the way to the top.
The world should worship Joel Embiid
"Embiid signing that extension was huge for the Sixers and Morey. I was pretty surprised when it happened with this SImmons situation looming, I honestly expected Joel to give a ""me or Simmons"" ultimatum prior to the signing. But all signs point to Embiid just being a guy who loves basketball and Philly, props to him"
We haven't even started the season and we've already got this kind of content from Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid: He does what he wants.  Ben Simmons: Subscribed.
"Joel Embiid is not paid to be a babysitter, but Ben Simmons sure has gotten paid a lot of money to be a baby."
"Joel Embiid is not paid to be a babysitter, but Ben Simmons sure has gotten paid a lot of money to be a baby."
"nah. I dont think anyone is against philly right now. The narrative is almost exclusively anti bum simmons. Philly fans hate bum simmons, other people hate bum simmons.  Philly can wait quite a long time.  Even Joel Embiid is on ownership side, not on simmons side"
"Morey: Joel, change Ben’s diapers       Embiid: No u"
"I don't buy into that though, they weren't the first or the last team to tank for multiple high draft picks, they were just the most outspoken about it, which is what everybody seems to remember and not like about Hinkie.   The Process worked from the standpoint that they got Joel Embiid, a true once in a generation player. The reason you tank is to increase your odds of getting a once in a generation player like that because you won't win a championship without one."
"Imagine being Joel Embiid right now. Turning 28 soon, doesn't really have a long time left before he starts declining since big men don't age well. And your remaining time is being wasted because of Morey's ego."
"Joel Embiid yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Isiah Joe gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Tyrese Maxet yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Ben hit the locker room door, former NBA great Charles Barkley hugged him and said, “Your're suspended!.”"
"In the league's first 48 seasons, 1 foreign born player won MVP (Hakeem in '94, \~2%), Over the last 17 years, 6 MVPs have gone to foreign born players (\~36%).   On top of that, there is an excellent chance for a foreign born MVP to win it again in the next few years, Joel Embiid, Luka Dončić could be first time winners while Jokic and Giannis could repeat/threepeat."
Google this guy called Joel Embiid
"Capela is a rim running big who plays good defense. He's one of the best defenders in the league.  Ayton has shown that he can be that, but he's also shown that he can post up or face up and he has a bit of that game. He's flashed a three point shot, and he's a solid ft shooter. Capela isn't any of those, and he likely won't be. Ayton can grow into being like Joel embiid,wiyh the huge frame and the soft touch. You'd think that player will be worth the max in 4 years so you pay for the potential. But just because you had him playing the capela role because you have two great guards doesn't make him any less valuable as a player.  My point is, ayton is younger and can definitely grow into way more than capela. You pay for potential too in the contract. Especially after you ask a player to sacrifice for the greater good of the team and he does it."
"What a bunch of bullshit. Ayton isn't Joel Embiid, y'all bugging here. He's not. If anything CP3 is making him look good."
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"1983 Sixers   PG: Mike Conley(Mo Cheeks)  &gt;fringe all star level players, both good defenders and passers   SG: Demar Derozan(Andrew Toney) &gt; fringe all star level players, both very good scorers that don’t take many 3’s  SF: Kevin Durant(Julius Erving) &gt;Elite all around hall of fame players   PF:(Marc Iavaroni)  &gt; don’t have a comparison I literally know nothing about this guy he averaged 5 points a game  C: Joel Embiid(Moses Malone) &gt;MVP caliber centers"
"A 7’’ Joel Embiid with a 7’10” wingspan and 10 more inches of vertical would break basketball.  He doesn’t need help with free throws, and he’d never need to shoot a three with those measurables , so this isn’t a tough decision at all."
"Kind of hilarious how the dude has already played with:   Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and now Chris Paul and Devin Booker."
"&gt;	A reporter wanted the Sixers head coach’s thoughts on Simmons’ only attempting four goals and passing up an apparent open late-game layup or dunk in the Sixers’ 103-96 Round 2, Game 7 loss to the Hawks.  &gt;	“I don’t know,” Rivers said. “I don’t know. Obviously he struggled from the free throw line and that became a factor in the series. There’s no doubt about that. I still believe in him, but we have work to do. We’re going to have to get in the gym, put a lot of work in and go forward.”  Lol it’s a joke that you’re actually defending Simmons having a meltdown over that quote. Especially after Rivers stuck up for him all year ([here, ](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/10/05/doc-rivers-on-simmons-and-embiid-it-clearly-works-when-they-play-together/)[here, ](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/03/16/76ers-coach-doc-rivers-calls-ben-simmons-dpoy-lock-he-guards-every-position/)[and here](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/05/26/ben-simmons-76ers-take-it-to-wizards-in-game-2-marred-by-fans-popcorn-dump/) )  There’s a reason why nobody that actually followed the situation all year is on Bens side here. He had one of the worse series I’ve ever seen and it wasn’t the first time he disappeared in the playoffs. What doc and Joel said was so mild coming off that horrible loss."
"Joel Embiid, Luka, JT, Jimmy, PG, and Dame honestly don’t touch draymond in terms of accomplishments. He’s a 3x champion, a DPOY, and has been on multiple All NBA and All Defensive teams lol"
Most everything you just said applies to Kyrie Irving too.  Or Gordon Hayward.  Or Joel Embiid.  Kawhi Leonard.  Jimmy Butler.  Kyle Lowry.  And those are just the top of market names with annual 10-20+ game absences.  Tons more as you move down the food chain.  I'm not trying to make the case that Brogdon hasn't gotten injured a lot.  I'm merely pointing out that he isn't so far out of the ballpark of what is considered normal these days that it's not much of an impact on his salary.  Teams no longer consider missing 15-20 games that big of a deal because it's become so common.
Then Tobias Harris called Joel Embiid a doodiehead!
"One lead his team to an NBA finals his 3rd year, the other is Joel Embiid.  Jog on 6ers fan"
"3rd year Joel Embiid got maxed.  He was still a huge injury flag and an inefficient 20 point scorer.  If 3rd year Embiid was worth the max, 3rd year Ayton is worth the max and would have scored a more efficient 20 points per game if he didn't sacrifice touches/shots  Did you think Philly did the right thing maxing Embiid after a one season sample size of inefficient play for a bigman?"
"James harden, giannis, Kyrie Irving,  kawhi Leonard, Joel embiid, Kevin Durant, Luka doncic, jayson Tatum, Jimmu butler, Paul George, jokic, Chris Paul, lillard   The list can go on and on"
"He really isn't match-up limited. He'll get pushed around by Embiid, but almost everyone either gets pushed around by Embiid or watches Joel go right by them anyway. Centers just don't need to be 275+ lbs anymore and don't have to defend guys like Enes Kanter very often.   As for offense, he's an elite rim-runner, fairly good rebounder, and good passer. And last year he showed jumpers from the elbows and baseline, though we don't know if he'll make them enough to be respected from those spots. But it shows that he has worked on those shots and is trying to improve his game, and isn't afraid to shoot when open."
"I just feel like the only reason people are even critical of how Philly or Doc or Embiid handled the situation is because of how much of a baby Ben is. If Doc and Joel said what they said, and Ben was like ""im gonna go work on my shot, i gotta be better"" All of this would be meaningless."
Seems odd to me no one mentioned Joel Embiid yet.
"Here are the total number of regular season games missed in the last five years and these players' ages:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old"
"Yeah it’s a little weird to this concern phrased as if it were absurd. He had lower body injuries for basically three straight years and had articles saying that his diet included like three giant [milkshakes a day](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/06/sixers-landry-shamet-buys-joel-embiid-four-milkshakes-every-road-trip/) (which he later claimed he didn’t consume, FWIW).   He’s turning the “injury-prone” label around lately but it’s not like there wasn’t a reason for it."
"""You know, Simmons, just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... [and totally redeem yourself!"" - Joel Embiid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSr-VWc_7WQ)"
"Philadelphia 76ers President Daryl Morey proudly waited outside the visiting locker room after the final buzzer to give Joel Embiid and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Tobias Harris yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Danny Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Ben Simmons yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Embiid hit the locker room door, former NBA great Allen Iverson hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"I don’t know man. Simmons-JRich-Tobi-Al-Embiid was a tough watch. Tobi attempted &lt;3 3FGA a game, and preferred playing iso around the paint. Joel fucking Embiid was our best floor spacer 2 years ago"
"Just because he has more FTs than Harden doesn’t mean he foul baits as much. Majority of his fouls come from driving hard to the rim, absorbing contact and actually getting fouled. That is very different to getting your FTs by hooking defender’s arms and wildly throwing your head back to sell the slightest contact.   For example, Joel Embiid and (young) Michael Jordan are both proportionally similar in terms of how dependent they are on free throws to score their points. You gonna say Michael freaking Jordan of the Bad Boys era foul baits just because of that?"
"Box out Joel Embiid, Steven Adams, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, etc for 5 possessions and lmk how you’re feeling"
"Brogdon's only competition was Dario Saric and Joel Embiid who only played 37 games. Even with Joel clearly being the better player, there was barely a race realistically as Brogdon doubled the game's played while putting up solid on a playoff team."
"Agreed. Although two things: Joel Embiid should have an honorable mention and UNC’s honorable mention list should include Stackhouse, Antawn Jamison, Brad Daugherty and probably a couple more."
"NBC dogpiling off the same report:  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/10/15/report-some-76ers-suspected-ben-simmons-faked-potential-coronavirus-exposure-to-dodge-game-7-vs-hawks/  &gt; The lasting image of Ben Simmons‘ 76ers tenure: Passing up an open dunk late in Philadelphia’s Game 7 loss to the Hawks last season.  &gt; The moment resonates so much for two reasons: 1. Joel Embiid spotlighted it as the game’s turning point. 2. It didn’t feel like an aberration.  &gt; Even for someone hesitant to shoot (especially 3-pointers), Simmons’ confidence looked especially shaken as that second-round series progressed. He stopped shooting in fourth quarters entirely. He made just 33% of his free throws."
A hit-piece by Ramona Shelburne….? And she’s bragged in the past about having a connection to Joel Embiid…. Hmmm…
"Alright I'll educate you real quick lol. I was just going to laugh and move on but I'll break it down for you don't worry.  I'm actually a physical therapist so just stay in your lane.  (cute attempt with the boy comment tho)   1, his height makes it harder to actually exert weight on him without committing a obvious foul. This is partially due to his center of gravity being so low, which for example is why tall players like porzingus or markkanen have a tough time posting up ""normal height"" nba players (6f3 - 6f8).   He frequently used that to his advantage when jostling to get open or take position, and while driving.  Not only this, but it was FAR harder to actually elbow lock or hip check him, because their elbow was near his head and their hip was around his chest area, making it extremely obvious if you tried one of the two tactics. You see this to a (much lesser) extent now when some bigs get called on tiktak fouls while boxing out guards or smaller players. You see this factor in many sports also, not just the NBA. There are multiple [Studies like this one](https://i.imgur.com/wXZqQh9.png) backing it.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tall-players-like-joel-embiid-are-more-prone-to-injury/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3642005/  https://www.researchgate.net/post/Do_long_limbed_tall_athletes_exhibit_poor_balance_have_increased_injury_risk  2, his thighs were part of why number 1 was possible. If your legs are weak, ESPECIALLY your thighs and glutes, center of gravity won't help you much and they'll buckle when coming into contact with larger players, and tire out faster. When your legs tiree out, you become multiplicitively more succeptive to injury throughout your body because of unconscious overcompensation.   His legs were very strong, which did multiple things to protect him, chief among those was allow his body to stay in balance when being in contact, allowing his kinetic chain to be less disturbed, aka less chance of soft tissue damage by way of pulling or aggravating. When you're knocked around off your center your muscles have to overcompensate  to pull you back, often leading to injuries.  You add those two factors together, along with his height, and shorter ligaments, and it makes him considerably less likely to be victim of literally the most common and lingering injuries in the NBA."
"You do not have to go that far back. People forget where the embiid takes where when he went 0/11 in a 0 point game that the sixers loss to the raptors, 96-101. A month and a half later when embiid went down with a fucked up finger and simmons had a small scoring explosion (22 pts in January is pretty damn good for simmons) and there where questions on if the sixers should trade one, should it be Ben or Joel?"
&gt;multiple sources say he seemed to prefer to build around Ben Simmons over Joel Embiid.  Multiple sources? He literally tweeted this from his burner accounts we've known this for years now
"&gt; Feelings over facts?  &gt; [you might just happen to feel a little bit like they didn't really have your best interests at heart.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/q8rsgo/shelburne_ben_simmons_almost_missed_game_7_vs/hgrk0ya/)   &gt; You think Morey is scrolling instagram comments chewing his nails over ""Nastygrams"".

"Feelings over facts? Nastygrams? You think Morey is scrolling instagram comments chewing his nails over ""Nastygrams"".   If this was Joel Embiid instead of Ben Simmons, would you feel the same way?  I don't even live in Boston. I don't have a fucking vendetta against Philadelphia.

If your personal bias and kneejerk reaction to defend your team trumps any reasonable discussion about this then just come out and say it."
"For what it's worth, Ramona is one of the few national reporters who seems to be in regular contact with Joel Embiid.    I'm not saying this report is necessarily accurate or exactly reflects Embiid's perspective, but I do find it more interesting coming from her than a random ESPN reporter writing what they've heard through the grapevine."
"You've got however many years of prime Joel Embiid, legitimately one of the best and most impactful players in the league. You were the #1 seed, the Nets had been banged up all season, Milwaukee still had obvious flaws that the playoff run helped them overcome. No question that the Sixers are at the very least the favorites in the East with a Lowry trade - he was the second best player on a championship team two years ago.  Trading for Lowry last season might have given the Sixers the best chance at a ring that they are going to have in the near future. If your FO doesn't figure it out and Embiid's prime goes by without a Finals appearance at least, that decision should absolutely feel like a ""what if?"" moment to your fanbase."
Basically Fertita didnt want Harden back with Morey. Anything short of trading Joel Embiid himself would have been rejected.
"Coolest part of it is that Morey will recognize how much Embiid means to the franchise. Embiid decides where they go from here and all he's shown this organization is the right stuff. Let Giannis get one more and then Joel can crush it, far as I'm concerned."
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
"[Embiid and Morey are pretty close  and were even playing tennis together during the offseason](https://twitter.com/weisspat1/status/1422982718112030721). If there's one thing I'm confident about in this Simmons shitshow it's that those two are on the same wavelength. Daryl's obviously communicated to Joel what his strategy is for dealing with the situation and gotten his approval. So people should chill with the ""Embiid is going to force his way out because Morey is wasting his prime"" talk."
New 76ers GM Joel Embiid
Is it notoriously hard to predict or do people just not like publicly reporting on their findings? I think we can say with fair certainty that Joel Embiid will not play 82 games this year.
"NBA podcaster types are saying Joel Embiid looks like he’s in great shape, and are hopeful he can stay healthy a whole season. I just hope he can be healthy for the post-season."
Joel Embiid has a similar shot chart to tony parker. Doesn't make them similar players. Shaq and Giannis are both historic paint scorers but Giannis does it slashing from the perimeter. Embiid is obviously more perimeter based than shaq but shaq and jo both use power and are both great back to the basket scorers.
Embiid is no where near as dominant as Giannis and Shaq at the rim. Zion and Giannis are definitely more dominant inside than Joel. Joel likes to play on the perimeter and face up to use the midrange a lot as well.  Giannis averages 7 more points in the paint than Joel.
"How were things any less tough for Wiseman…  He missed all of training camp because he caught COVID, and then he was expected to come in as a starter and help us win games on a playoff team. When he couldn’t do that, we were forced to bench him and then he got hurt and missed the rest of the season.   And even if he doesn’t never end up as good as Ball or Edwards, I don’t see how that automatically means we will regret picking him. At the end of the day, making sure he’s a good player is more important than making sure he’s better than everyone else in his draft class. He may not be Joel Embiid, but if he can end up as a Clint Capela I think that’s fine too."
"Pre-injury, I would have said Boogie Cousins…now maybe Joel Embiid? Zion Williamson is kinda like a mini Shaq and obviously Giannis is like the forward version of Shaq. But since Boogie fell from grace I haven’t seen anybody who really reminded me too much of Shaq as a whole"
"Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, and JJ Redick.  I would have slapped you if you told me that team wasn’t going to sweep the Eastern Conference before those playoffs started lol"
"He was considered to be a more proven, but also more boring version of what Giannis is now, because he had 2 titles. Great defender (although still somehow underrated), dominant offense, but not a good shooter overall, fantastic team guy. Shaq was thought to be the highest upside guy and best playoff performer. KG was seen more as a superstar player on the rise like Joel Embiid, but mostly without injury problems.  So Duncan was considered to be always contending for best player and championships, but not to be utterly dominant, like Jordan or KAJ or Lebron at times."
Joel embiid would make us contenders
"[The Athletic] While an Irving trade for Ben Simmons with Philadelphia is seen by some as an easy solution to both teams’ problems, sources with knowledge of the 76ers’ view said there is no interest in Irving at the moment.  Source: https://theathletic.com/2885135/2021/10/12/amick-kyrie-irving-proves-again-hes-comfortable-being-uncomfortable/  &gt; One thing is for sure — at least for now. While an Irving trade for Ben Simmons with Philadelphia is seen by some as an easy solution to both teams’ problems, sources with knowledge of the 76ers’ view said there is no interest in Irving at the moment. From management on down, it seems there is an unsurprising level of skepticism about that pairing working out any better than the Joel Embiid-Simmons duo that is zombified at the moment.  &gt; And in the absence of Irving getting an extension from the Nets — which is obviously not happening now — the other tricky part here is that he can opt out of his deal after this season. That’s obviously a major factor for any interested team."
"Joel was the favourite before he got hurt, Now if you look at this it shows the LeBron and Embiid were neck and neck heading into all star week, But that was because if the narrative of LeBron performing this well at his age when clearly Embiid had better numbers then LeBron and the Sixers were a higher seed then the Lakers, I believe Lakers were the 3rd or 4th seed heading into all star break. Embiid was definitely was the favourite to win MVP going into the all star break."
"They have Carmelo Anthony below Damian lillard, joel embiid, McGrady, and luka doncic. That doesn’t make sense"

"It’s still a terrible situation all around, and it was before everything blew up in the playoffs. I’ve seen reporters speculate that maybe Simmons can “patch things up “ and ride out his entire contract, which is just about the dumbest take I’ve heard on this. Look. It’s not just about him not wanting to play there. It’s Philly for one and Philly fans aren’t going to forgive him. But it isn’t even that, really. Ben Simmons can’t play on the court at the same time as Joel Embiid and still be everything Ben Simmons is. Complain all you want about that, malign his character all you want, but that’s just a fact. As long as Ben Simmons is making $30M a year and having to co-exist in the playoffs with Embiid, the 76ers are not going to win a championship.  That’s the facts of the situation and everything needs to stem from those facts. Do the 76ers play him as much as possible to establish that he is in fact a very good player? Yes, absolutely. If they go through the deadline and haven’t moved him yet, even if he’s completely reconciled with Joel and Doc and bought s brand new home in the area and all that, if I’m a Philly fan I should be *pissed*. Every season you have Embiid on your roster is potentially the last season you get before his injury issues overcome him and he turns into something less than the pre-eminent post player in all basketball. You absolutely need to get a better fit than Simmons. You needed this last year and frankly you needed to trade him for Harden when that was a possibility. Now shit has hit the fan once and you probably won’t get Harden levels of talent back (maybe Kyrie Irving though) but he needs to be moved."
"&gt; If he fixes that him and Joel would be lethal in the playoffs.  Here's hoping that doesn't happen, but yes, I've always believed that the Embiid/Simmons fit isn't as clunky as everybody makes it seem and they are actually great together (mainly because Embiid is ridiculously well-rounded), they've just lacked the 3rd guy, the guard/wing scorer who can reliably create his own shot and win a game in the 4th quarter.   I picked them to make the Finals each of the last 2 years, in 2020 the pre-season consensus was that it was either Milwaukee or Philly and I liked Philly better (you guys came outta nowhere, congrats), and last year, they were the 1 seed.   I have to see it to believe it with them now, that Atlanta loss was horrible."
[No linens unfortunately.](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/08/joel-embiid-and-daryl-morey-are-a-formidable-tennis-pairing.html)
"From the article:  That physical, and Wednesday’s first practice session, are just the beginning of several phases the Sixers have planned for reintegrating Simmons into their team environment. The team has individual film and weight training sessions planned. Philadelphia has consulted with various sports psychologists in the previous weeks, and the team believes it has bolstered the resources Simmons has available to improve his game, particularly by hiring a new shooting and skills coach. It would seem likely that Philadelphia will make a concerted effort to clear the air with Simmons and his teammates, particularly Joel Embiid.  ————————  What more do you want from the Sixers at this point?"
I think he's been managing Joel Embiid fine
Exactly. This isn't a Raptors or Wolves situation where VC and Butler were carrying bad teams. Embiid was an MVP runner up and the team is really well constructed for the modern nba (especially during the regular season). Part of me was almost hoping simmons didn't show up so I could see what the offensive looked like with Joel creating more from the post with 4 out.
"You are likely right, but the point is, Ayton didn’t go outta his way to try and prove he can play like a Joel embiid or something Bc the team is built on booker and cp3 playmaking…as a young player I’m sure he wanted to prove he could do those things but he held back on that opportunity..but now in a sense it’s being used against him negotiating wise…yes I think he’s not that type of big but he also hasn’t really tried to show he can be last year as a sacrifice for his team"
"Embiid is the one who put Ben on blast publicly?      If they were boys Joel could have said that shit to him face to face. I don't think he's mad that Joel was upset, he's mad that he aired it out in public instead of to him. Honestly, that is understandable. There aren't many examples of batman doing that to robin in the NBA in the last 20 years. It's a personal thing that Ben was hurt by. You don't bash your teammates in the media or post game pressers unless you are prepared to blow it up.  Ben said, okay fuck you too. Even Lebron walked out during his press conference after JR's epic mistake instead of bashing him."
In terms of duos I think Harden and Embiid would actually be dope. KD and Harden play well with each other but not off each other.  Would lowkey love to see a two-man game of Harden and Joel
"Imagine how fun this entire charade would’ve been if Joel was still in his “Troell Embiid” days where he was unfiltered on Socials.  He’s way too mature and level headed now. Which is good for the Sixers, but bad from an entertainment POV lmao"
with a purpose of pairing Joel Embiid with James Harden? he'll do it faster than Sam Presti gets off after acquiring another first pick in a trade
not all the team members do.  some of them are friends.  but it seems like currently ben and joel aren't on friendly terms.  embiid said he hasn't spoken to simmons even though some other members of the team have been talking to him (i think he sent him messages but simmons didn't respond?  need to go check if i made that up....)
"""I guess I'll have to settle for beating his ass in practice"" - Joel Embiid, probably"
"I mean, I think the situation was avoidable if Embiid voiced his concerns directly to Morey as opposed to blasting him post game. Everybody already thought Ben was out of there after that so it wouldn't have been the massive drama that it is now if they moved into the offseason looking at trade packages for Ben.      Embiid isn't wrong so to speak for being done with Ben's shit, but if Joel was being mature, this situation wouldn't be nearly the massive disaster it is for the sixers."
"Simmons gets in the locker room, gives Drummond that BIG Shug while staring at Embiid.  Then daps Joel as he is already looking for the next teamamte to dap."
"I don’t think he can play the 5 defensively.  That requires help defense and rim protection which isn’t his specialty.  He’s a great on ball guy which is good for the Nets switching system but if teams are hunting the mismatch (Harden), then Ben is basically being wasted in terms of his talents.  Ben is great because he’s the best guy his size at getting through screens putting him in a system that doesn’t require that minimizes that one special trait he has.  It’s why him and Embiid worked so well.  Joel protected the rim and Ben fought through screens.  On offense the Nets don’t really have enough 2 way shooters to play him at the 5.  Sure in theory you can have Patty, Harden, Joe, KD, and Ben but while that works on offense for you that actually hurts your defense not being able to play a Paul Millsap or Blake Griffin as well in the situations.  Guys who can switch but also help protect the rim somewhat.  It’s one of those good on paper until you break it down moves."
"That seems like a very good way to drive Embiid out of town, trading a headache for a headache. Joel needs someone that’s gonna be on the court every night."
Doc Rivers has left the chat…  Joel Embiid has left the chat…
"So my thoughts aren't too relevant on if I think he is either ""great"" or ""terrible"" in the long run right, but the league views Ben as a 3x All Star, 2x All NBA Defensive 1st team, 1x All NBA 3rd team player who also was a ROY and a runner up for the DPOY last year at the age of 25 with 4 years of control left on his contract.  He is an elite defensive player even before all the handchecking and such that is allowed now, and a pass first playmaker of a team that lost to Kawhi in a buzzer beater in game 7, saw his team get swept when he was injured, and held Trae Young to 5-23 shooting in that game 7 where he passed up a layup.   He is a non shooter, and despite that still averaged 15 - 7 - 7 on an FG% of 0.56 last year (down year).  I know it's a meme to think he is ""terrible"" because he doesn't shoot outside of the paint, but he is a winning player that has never missed the playoffs in his career (when healthy) and the 76ers (prior to this year) were below .500 in games he missed that still featured Joel Embiid in the lineup.     Tyrese Maxey and Korkmaz are making great strides this year.  Seth Curry is playing like a #2 offensive option and George Niang / Drummond have been miles ahead of Mike Scott and Dwight respectively so I am extremely happy with how we are playing.  That doesn't take away from what Ben Simmons is as a player."
"Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons:  “I used to think he was good, honestly. Obviously, on this team he’s doing way less than nothing.   What I’m impressed with is his female tendencies. He brings so much drama to all of us, on and off the court. I’m just confused why I have him.”"
"Absolutely this ... and Joel Embiid, Steph and KD are pretty good at basketball."
"Possible (even probable) but it also just makes sense on face value.  It was always a struggle to fit Ben and Joel into a lineup together, so someone was always sacrificing- the two stars, obviously, but also everyone else as they're forced to expand their roles beyond their comfort.  The way the team is constructed now, everything is more straightforward and everyone's job is simplified- other than Embiid, who looks ready to step up to the challenge of making everything work."
"&gt; Yeah I think one of the reasons we were able to have good defenses with Vuc at center was we pretty much kept him in the paint at all times. He rarely was caught in a mismatch in the perimeter or had to get out to a shooter because the scheme was designed around preventing those situations. Vuc for the most part just had to be a big body in the paint which he was pretty good at.  We're not asking him to switch thankfully but he does a lot of hedging for us and that means he's often a little late closing on the roller. Yesterday against Philly Embiid gave him the business from basically every direction because he always had that split second advantage that led him to an open shot. Vuc is smart but he's just not fast enough to recover against Joel.  &gt; I think a lot of his offensive struggles have been a result of him not getting very many post touches. He's most comfortable operating inside, most of his offense was ran through the post either playmaking or scoring. He pretty much only took 3s trailing in transition, and I feel like Chicago has tried to use him as a floor spacer in the half court instead.  I agree. He's been asked to keep the lane open for a drive and kick but we really don't have that many shooters so..."
"In theory, intent shouldn't matter when someone does something this negligent, especially when it's Joel Embiid, who has consistently just thrown his body around nearly injuring people. Just look at the video of him almost breaking Josh Giddey a couple of weeks ago. I'd love for him to be suspended because maybe it teaches him a lesson, but again, my comment about intent was in response to comment talking about the rule regarding punches. Should the rule be expanded to more explicitly cover something like this? Sure, but even if it did, you can't suspend someone by applying a rule that didn't exist at the time the incident occured retroactively."

I don't think it actually landed that much on Lonzo.  If Embiid actually punched him in the head or something I'm sure it would have had a much bigger effect on both men.  I don't think Joel felt like he connected on anything other than hair so he didn't think it was a big deal.
"i mean, like, I've seen 280. Miami LeBron was close to 280. I struggle to believe Joel Embiid isn't 300 pounds. it's not to say he's fat. he's just 7,2"" and muscular. i don't see how Boban is 291 and Embiid is 280. lol"
"They should've thrown him out for real. Dude potentially could have ended Lonzo's entire career (I want to say it's hyperbolic to replace career with ""life"" there, but it's a haymaker from Joel Embiid, like you're going to come out of your shoes if he hits that...) because he's getting emotional over a regular season kick ball, come the fuck on. This reminds me of Djokovic getting ejected from the US Open over sailing a ball into the line judge's throat, and they didn't fuck around, the game was over and he was out of the entire tourney within like 10 minutes. Watching this, and then later how he hits the game winner, was plain ridiculous. Hopefully he gets fined a lot... like I really never want to see someone almost get a brain trauma on the court man. And for that...."

Are you even a sixers fan? Why do you have a sixers flair if you are anti-Joel. He is legitimately great. I do think Jokic is better but Embiid is also great
"I mean, small sample size, but Joel Embiid seems to be doin just fine."
"I hope we're not taking in 5 years, what could have been Joel Embiid without all his injuries. For James Harden, rehabbing his injuries from last season and he's going to stop causing the unnatural contact, so his scoring will go up. James Harden will adjust the later, the former I don't know if he'll change, since he's over 30."
"Embiid hasn't looked right since the end of last season to me. Didn't he have a partial tear in his meniscus, but was still playing anyways? Not to mention the hit he took to the knee to start this season.. (dont know if it was the same leg). Either way.. I feel like the chances are higher that he misses a decent amount of time before we see top 3 fantasy production Joel again."
"The zone was legalized in 2001 specifically to counter Shaq and other low post centers. And the rules were changed again in 2004 to open up perimeter offense. That’s why no low post center has won MVP since, and some people say the traditional low post center is extinct in today’s game. Joel Embiid is probably as close as we have today, but he often gets the ball 15 or more feet away from the basket."
"Joel Embiid isn’t very obese with broken feet, and Embiid’s injury bounce back is pretty exceptional. Why not take the example of Greg Oden instead, who was beyond exciting but prone to catastrophic injury and had a short but very statistically successful career.

You mean Joel Embiid?
"According to one post down, Joel Embiid thinks it's an adjustment period to the new ball."
"In his three recent seasons in Philly, Joel Embiid has posted averages of 17.0 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists. As a rookie who plays alongside DeMarre Carroll and the Thunder, Embiid has struggled with the defensive approach with all of his possessions. And he was a part of the Hawks' offense the whole season when they shot 48.8 percent from three-point range, which led the league to record a record-breaking 30.5 minutes of offense. After last season, Embiid only posted a team-high 22 points on 13.4 percent shooting from the field. However, the 30 or so minutes last season were down to just 7.8 minutes per game after he dropped 18.8 percent of his shots from the field.  He's a good player – the guy can make the most of his minutes. He played in all four of Phillys playoff games, making 21 of his 28 shots with his teammates making 22.1 percent. That allowed up to 20 assists, while keeping a point guard that is far below his career averages of 24.9 points (11th) and 11.0 rebounds on the season."
"My thoughts are, this Sixers bench is the best we’ve seen in the Joel Embiid era which is HUGE!!! Maxey and Thybulle have taken big leaps this year! If we trade for a great player we have a chance at the chip or if Ben comes back with good offensive game. I have a good feeling."

"Funny how Joel Embiid comes out as getting fucked over pretty bad too, yet this subreddit's response to the ""Jokic doesn't get calls"" topic from last season was to spam Embiid hate threads."

&gt; Embiid probably will be too - I don't see any reason why that relationship should change.  Joel turns 33 in that final season.  He may still collect a paycheck but there's an extremely high chance he's useless by then due to injury.  At which point he could end up dumped as the Sixers rebuild in a post-Embiid world.
The 76ers without Joel Embiid just mollywopped the Trailblazers
"The same guy who picked Nerlins Noel, Joel Embiid and Jahlil Okafor in consecutive drafts LOL?  As if he wouldn't have taken Simmons.  His strategy was known to be BPA.  No shot he takes Jaylen Brown first that draft, it's laughable to even consider.  That 2019 team is exactly the type of team that Hinkie would have assembled.  His theory was always get a cornerstone piece or two and then consolidate everything else into a third star and backfill from there.  Simmons, Redick, Butler, Harris, Embiid is exactly that vision carried out."

"People in the Sixers organization would have known if Simmons was getting psychiatric help, even if the media/world at large did not know.   If Simmons getting professional help was something that had already been ongoing before the reports came out, the Sixers would never have fined him for missing preseason games. They would not have tried to force him to show up for training camp. We would not have been getting comments about ""babysitting"" from Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers. They're not that vicious."
He’s a solid player and it was a good pick up for just about any team. That is unless your franchise player is a finisher who scores at the rim like shaq and needs a ton of space…   It’s why I personally don’t get what griffin is doing. He keeps making these moves for solid centers that actively impede his stars. It’s like pairing Joel embiid with a post scoring power forward. Like why? Embiid is better at scoring in the post and would do better with a shooting 4
Herro has the same amount of shot attempts within 5ft (18) as Joel Embiid does
"Man if the Heat play the Bulls in the playoffs we all win. And that's not even counting the Nets and Bucks. There's good odds that some variation of those matchups happen, and then the ECF is some other variation of those teams. Eastern playoffs are going to be amazing to watch this year. And then if Philly can find a way to make Joel Embiid last through the whole season we get to watch him play one of these teams too. Eastern playoffs are gonna be something special this year, because I think realistically all series in the 2nd round and the ECF can go to 7. ______ I haven't been this hyped for the Eastern playoffs in a very, very long time"
yea this is all from embiid and everyone knows it  looks like joel gave him one more chance at the team meeting with the hug heard round the world and is starting to regret it.  If you have an in with a top 10 player like this who you are essentially the only source for you dont just go say some random shit you arent sure about
"This just reminds me of the Jeapordy clip where the contestant instead of guessing “the process”, they decide to go with “who is Joel ‘Do a 180’ Embiid”"
"east all stars right now: starters - Zach Lavine, Lamelo Ball, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Giannis bench - Demar Derozan, Julius Randle, Trae Young, Brad Beal, Miles Bridges, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid  after that there’s still guys like OG, Harden, Middleton, etc... who’ll be in the running. Depending on injuries I can maybe see Brown making it."
its important to remember than a Drummond is 80% of a Joel Embiid. He may lack the 20% that would make him the second coming of Hakeem. But he is still a very very solid center.
"I mean I agree, he needs to prove his weight and the injuries won't be issues for him. I just think it's way too early to write that off as impossible.  Kinda reminds me of Joel Embiid too. Started off missing two years straight, and he still hasn't really put together a full season. But that's not really stopping him from getting MVP and DPOY consideration, and people generally aren't as worried about his long term health."
"He already said that he can't play with Joel Embiid, remember? Have to fire him too. Oh and he can't face 76ers fans, they have to be fired also."
"Joel ""Jusuf Nurkic"" Embiid and Andre ""Big Honey Penguin"" Drummond"

"Are you sure you want to die on that hill. If you don't adjust for minutes and efficiency, you end up with some odd takes.  Behind Door Number 1: Simmons is better than Joel. After all, Zion has averaged more games played than Embiid. 42.5 for Zion, 37.1 for Embiid. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure how those career stats look if you drop them next to Simmons'"

dame could help embiid be more of a defensive anchor also by taking that first scoring role. he could really unlock a lot with joel.
Embiid is the guy I truly feel the worst for in this whole Simmons debacle.  Mom and dad are going through a messy divorce and Joel is the child being hurt.

Joel Embiid not injured but also not going to play?!? Never would have guessed

"&gt; “You look at our last couple of games, we’ve been going against some real alligators down there, from [Joel} Embiid and [Jonas] Valanciunas.  Foreign bigs are reptile people, confirmed by Taj."
"Steph and his rebounding numbers. Steph IS one of the better rebounding guards in the league, but you wanna know what's a big secret?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  98% of all of the rebounds Russ, Steph, Dame, Lebron, KD, Harden, literally all non PF/Cs get are meaningless. Contested Defensive Rebounds are the only rebounds that matter in Defensive Rebounds, because they prevent Offensive Rebounds. I think Steph's rebounding isn't really notable as others say, what it represents is his IQ, positioning and hustle despite the obvious physical limitations. The 6 RPG or 10 rebounds 3 times in 4 games or whatever means nearly nothing, that's the honest truth.  &amp;#x200B;  Side note, if you look at who gets the most contested rebounds, it's all centers, proving that a Joel Embiid rebound is FAAAAAAAAR more important than a James Harden rebound or something."
"This bulls team is just a combination of players that are not proven outside of the regular season and their 3 best players ultimately will need the ball in their hands down the stretch in order to be effective. Zach Lavigne has never even been on a winning team his whole career so I think the assumption that he’ll take the leap, while possible, makes the bulls an easy team to sleep on. People citing defensive metrics and whatever forget the fact that it’s only 6 games into the season, yeah they came out hot but down the stretch of the season when injuries pile up and more teams get their schemes in order, I don’t see the bulls making that much noise. Lonzo ball and Alex Caruso are not enough together to anchor a defense, and I don’t know how the bulls will ever hope to stop someone like giannis or Joel embiid. So yeah, I think everyone’s high on the bulls because they started 4-0, I’ll be more interested in evaluating them once they drop a couple of games and face adversity to see how they’re responding."
"I did not say Gobert is not top 10 simply because his team lost.  I explained that players who are top 10 with the Jazz roster would take it to the Finals. The Jazz roster against last years Western Conference was enough for Embiid or AD on to get them out of the West last year. Their inside presence offensively would be so dominant with the ball handling and shooting around them and they can also serve as quality defensive anchors while being a bit better on the perimeter.   Gobert does not provide enough on the offensive to cover for flaws that a roster may have. Luka also took the clippers WITH kawhi to 7 with a worse roster than Utah and without very good perimeter defense. And those are the 3 guys ranked in the bottom of the top 10.  Also LeBron's Cavs team was also much much much worse than the Jazz roster which literally has another all-star and top 25 player next to Gobert. Lebron, literally made the Finals though. That's so much more than not ever getting past the second round lol.  But Who is Rudy Gobert better than out of these guys? Because that's the only conversation that matters when talking about top 10.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis.  I think there's seasons around 2013-2015 where Gobert these past two seasons could have been top 10 but he's not in this current NBA."
"Yeah of course I’m not denying the existence of the weak point but I feel that what makes the top 10 players is that despite a weakness, they have a level of brilliance that can overcome that. Gobert falls just short of providing enough offensively to be part of the top 10 players.   Like you give all that talent around him to Joel Embiid who is generally ranked around 8th and that team is an absolute terror to guard while still having a great defensive anchor. Clippers don’t stop that Jazz team with a dominant inside force offensively.  I’m not trying to hate on Gobert and never did I say the Jazz perimeter defense is fine and not a hole. But all I’m saying is the roster construction is overall still good and that Gobert just isn’t top 10. I think he can be as high as 13ish. I definitely understand the argument of having him over guys like Kyrie and Tatum which many would scoff at."
"Being young and having money, then living in Louisiana with all of that great food is a recipe for disaster.   Joel Embiid had similar same weight issues when he was not playing, but I think he got an nutritionist to help with that."
How the hell Joel Embiid only get 5 rebounds???
Joel Embiid punching the air right now.
He's down 0.7 PPG so far this season. Fellow First Team All-Flop player Joel Embiid is down 7 PPG this season.
The clippers literally don’t have a real point guard either. The center/wing comparison is moot. It matters who is more talented. Centers have been floor raisers for teams too. It was just a weird comment by u tbh. The sixers lost ben Simmons. The clippers lost their best player. Idk what the comparison or point u were trying to make. Joel embiid is better at basketball than Paul George? Yes we know.
"Offensive juggernaut Joel Embiid and defensive specialist Ben Simmons. Oh, wait!"
Joel Embiid just hurts his knee and is out 3 weeks after reading this comment
All I know is Joel Embiid would kill for a redo of the draft that landed Philly Simmons over Ingram...
"&gt;He's dropped from around 9 to 4, considering that he was 3rd in the NBA in drives per game,   Orrrrr, most of his free throws came from foul baiting and not contact in the paint because a part of a crafty guard skill set is avoiding the trees that are trying to block your shot.  &gt;I'd say the high volume baiters that most can agree on are Trae, Luka, Harden, Butler, and Embiid. Jimmy and Joel dropped 1 attempt a game, while the other three lose about 4.   So the 2 guys in this study, known to be more on the relative aggressive side (Jimmy and Embiid), lose 1 and the others lose about the same? That actually makes even more sense to me lol."
"&gt;Well yeah considering he was one of the biggest purportrators that makes sense to me. Is he currently averaging 0 ftpg? Who else on the Hawks is a ft magnet? How does that compare to the other large purprotrators? Don't compare it to the whole league lol, only a select few players had mastered that bait foul.  He's dropped from around 9 to 4, considering that he was 3rd in the NBA in drives per game, I think that's too low. The only other guy with a knack for drawing fouls would be Gallinari and Lou-Will.  I'd say the high volume baiters that most can agree on are Trae, Luka, Harden, Butler, and Embiid. Jimmy and Joel dropped 1 attempt a game, while the other three lose about 4.  &gt;If you think him getting a lack of free throws is the equivalent to him being punished lol then sure, I don't think that at all. Is it fair that he (and others) got a plethora of calls simply because he is a superstar? Was he arguing about it then? No? So what changed except these new rules?  The lack of free throws due to baiting being nullified isn't a punishment, it's the lack of legitimate fouls being called that is an issue. The refs are not only  enforcing the new rules, but they are going overboard on not calling legit fouls that are not a result of baiting.  Also I'd point out that Trae wasn't getting calls because he was superstar, he was getting them because he was a good baiter, he wasn't recognized as a superstar until his playoff performance."
"I agree Simmons is a very good player regardless of his issues, I just think the team is still structured well and has enough talent. Embiid is an MVP candidate, and Maxey seems to have made a step to fill in. What Maxey lacks overall he does make up for some in spacing around Joel. I think them Atlanta and Miami are all going to finish very close to one another."
"You forgot to name the honorable mentions:  * LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers * Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers * Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat * Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks * Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves.  I'm annoyed they even put Lebron's and/or Luka's name on there if this list is supposed to be a current ladder."
"&gt; We're not getting physically faster or stronger. Usain Bolt may be the fastest man alive ever but Joel Embiid isn't physically stronger than Wilt or Shaq.  better PEDs absolutely do make people stronger or faster. also a shitload of more people were born or left poverty since then, so given that the talent pool is hundreds of times bigger, the top athletes are probably actually faster / stronger in terms of potential + go even beyond that potential with better PEDs."

Joel “I’ll do it myself” Embiid. Simmons refuse to shoot? he learns to shoot threes effectively. Simmons refuse to play at all? he learns to handle the ball and playmake. I dont think there is anything he cant do at this point.
What?? Simmons guy would double Embiid and prevent simmons from making the pass. It is one of the biggest problems with the Joel/Ben pairing.
"We are objectively getting faster, but that is due to massive advances in our understanding of dietary science, sports medicine (muscle development and recovery), and related technologies like footwear (or pole vaulting poles or compound bows or whatever).  We're not getting physically faster or stronger.  Usain Bolt may be the fastest man alive ever but Joel Embiid isn't physically stronger than Wilt or Shaq.  Kyrie is less athletic and crafty around the basket than prime MJ.  I don't know if anyone would shoot like Curry in the modern era, possible GOAT muscle memory, but people like Bird or could come damn close.  Just the randomness of the top 0.000001% of athlete genetics, and then the rest is diet or sports science."
Never thought I’d feel this angry following a Joel Embiid step back 3 to end a game
Spin to win by Joel “Do a 180” Embiid
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
"So when Joel Embiid plays basketball, Drummond goes to his house to clean and tidy up the place?"
"Joel ""Kevin Durant"" Embiid"
"Joel ""Web"" Embiid"
Gunna be fun watching people who watch Joel Embiid play C convince themselves that Drummond’s defense in the same game is good.
Have fun with that Drummond/Embiid/Simmons lineup.   Someone get Joel a stress ball.
Fuck the national media the 76ers have tried to force Joel Embiid and Simmons to play together Joel’s entire career and not one media member has ever suggested Joel should demand a trade.  I don’t see Simmons suggestions Tatum whose team got destroyed in the first round should demand a trade.  The media only does this to small markets and it hurts the sport
*Hasn't played one game of professional basketball*   best center since Joel Embiid XD   He could turn out to be good but you're really jumping the gun with this one.
&gt; best center Evan Mobley since Joel Embiid  Wiseman was just drafted last year
(Joel Embiid)
"Joel Embiid is the best center in the league. If you surround him with the right pieces, he can win a championship.  But yeah, I'll give you a moment to process imagining the spacing with Bam and Ben ;)"
"And Joel Embiid had a torn meniscus. Hunter is a bigger loss, I’ll give you that, but the 76ers’ biggest problem was shooting, don’t underestimate the loss of Danny green. I think Embiid’s injury + no Danny Green outweighs Hunter and Reddish."
"And Joel Embiid, the best player in the series, was playing on a torn meniscus. Hunter is a good player but Cam isn’t a difference maker yet, he even might be a net negative in the playoffs."
"Just because you can play him alongside Jarrett Allen, doesn't mean you should.  Just because Anthony Davis can play alongside Dwight Howard doesn't mean he should.  Just because Chris Bosh can play alongside Joel Anthony doesn't mean he should.  Just because Al Horford can play alongside Joel Embiid doesn't mean he should."
Highest paid centers in the league today:  1. Rudy Gobert (3x DPOY)  2. Karl-Anthony Towns (2x All-Star)  3. Nikola Jokic (MVP)  4. Joel Embiid (4x All-Star)  5. Jarrett Allen
"Ben Simmons taking up a max/supermax slot destroys your ability to win a playoff series against a good team.  He locks down one opposing good player - and a good team has at least three threats (I also would back any of Steph, Giannis, KD or Harden to get theirs with Simmons guarding them), and provides transition offense.  But he doesn't provide any of rim protection, shooting, free throw shooting or being a point guard, all of which are expensive to get.  And it turns out, you can start with Joel Embiid and can't get all of them in a salary cap with Ben Simmons in it.  ""Good"" is irrelevant. Fit matters more."
"Ok and Morey inherited Joel Embiid lmfaoo. That's the main reason the Sixers were good last year, if that's the game we're gonna play. Morey gave him spacing with Curry and Green but any competent GM would've done that.   Masai was considered great even before the Kawhi trade. He's elite because he's able to supplement his stars and give them the best chance at a ring. Lowry and Derozan were doing nothing until Masai changed the supporting cast around them.   Morey couldn't even find a proper second star for Harden until the CP trade years later. And then he flipped him prematurely for a worse fit. He's repeating that again with the Sixers. Your ceiling at this point is second round exit. Same as it has been since 2001🤣.  I guarantee you the Raptors future beyond next year is looking a lot brighter than the Sixers. Your team is one Embiid injury away from the process part 2. Mans out here comparing Masai to Bryan Colangelo lmaoo."
"Honestly the real issue is that the 3 of them really don't compliment each other. While the obvious issue is Ben's lack of floor stretching and what that causes, neither Tobias or Embiid  are good enough passers to find Ben when he cuts or has mismatches in the post.   We just have a lot of possessions where its either the ball stopping with Tobias, Ben drive and kick, or a Joel iso."

"Definitely watch some historical clips over the years to watch how the game started and has developed. I personally recommend starting around the 80s and watching some highlights of the Celtics and Lakers match-ups, especially their finals match-ups. Detroit in the late '80s brought an overwhelming defensive presence to the game which changed things up a bit. Then of course you have to watch the greatness that was Michael Jordan in the 90s, the double three-peat.   After that you'll be caught up to the 2000s where things are a lot more current and familiar. Assuming you don't know but the Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and San Antonio Spurs were the powerhouse teams in the early 2000s, followed by a power move by the Celtics in 08 to form ""the first"" ""Big Three."" I personally believe this move  by the Celtics is what has powered a lot of the motivation behind free agency/trades over the last decade plus. Around that same time was the rise of LeBron James, widely regarded as the second-best player (or best, depending who you are talking to) to Michael Jordan. LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat started his Finals dominance the last decade which was very entertaining to watch as he showed up in the Finals nine out of ten years from 2011-2020 with the Heat, Cavaliers, and now Lakers.   The Golden State Warriors rose as a titan in 2015 and began their reign, with Steph Curry greatly evolving the game by extending the expectations of 3 point shooting. Kevin Durant, regarded as the current second-best player to LeBron James in the NBA, joined the Warriors in 2016 and formed what was known as the ""Hampton Five"" - which was arguably the best line-up in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant left the Warriors after 2019 for the Nets, which brings us to today's game (upcoming year) where there has been somewhat of a vacuum left by the Warriors from the last decade, in which several teams are in-contention (including the Warriors, I think) for the upcoming years to establish a new dynasty.   James Harden's trade from the Rockets to the Nets was regarded as the largest move last year and many expect Brooklyn to take home the championship in the next 1-2 years. It is a great time to get in the game as there are many young players on several teams who are still blossoming as the leaders of their franchises and are expected to join the ranks of the elite like Trae Young on the Hawks, Zion Williams on the Pelicans, and now you could say Cade Cunningham on the Pistons - while we are still watching the rise of other potential all-time greats like Giannis on the Bucks, Joel Embiid on the Sixers, and Luka Doncic on the Mavericks.  Great time to get into the sport and hope you enjoy it!"
Joel Embiid full court launch from earlier last season
That fool Joel Embiid kept calling for the ball in the 4th quarter and turning it over.  Meanwhile the chad Ben Simmons never called for the ball in the 4th quarter. He wasn't even on the court! And people have the audacity to blame him.  Much to think about.
I wouldn't remove anything. But I would add a HORSE tournament. I don't know why. I just wanna see Steph nail a half court shot and then Joel Embiid have to attempt to make it or get a H.
"Uhhh we’ve been having this conversation every single year since bens rookie year actually (concerning getting Embiid a real point guard that shoots and whether Ben and Joel fit together), this is just the most attention it’s ever gotten now that there’s really no doubts as to whether Ben can develop offensively"
The only thing between Philly and completely screwed is that Joel Embiid hasn't demanded a trade.  But the clock is ticking on him signing a supermax.

They really aren’t comparable. Bam as a center has a serviceable enough shot where defenders respect his middy   Ben is a guard who refuses to shoot (regardless of ability) so defenders can completely sag off and double whoever the best scoring threat is on the floor with him which in most cases is Embiid or Tobias if Joel is on the bench
&gt;Joel Embiid down the line   Why do I feel like there’s an easier way than going to New York…
@wojespn: “Breaking: 76ers center Andre Drummond reportedly ‘demanded’ to start at center over Joel Embiid as a condition of his signing. Sixers ultimately rejected that demand.”
"As a casual NBA fan, I have really no clue who Ben Simmons is. I do know who Joel Embiid is though, which should say a lot."
And Joel wasn't even fed up to start. It was only when the Simmons camp ran their mouth about not being able to work with Embiid.
"The stadium literlaly sold disgusting meat pies from australia for him. The team catered to him so much that the GM who drafted him got fired for constantly trashing Joel Embiid in favor of ben simmons during burner gate. The man got standing ovations from the crowd simply for attempting open 3s. Such a frustrating situation, I enjoy watching Ben play and I really wish this wasn't how he chose to go about this. It sucks that a player I like is actively trying to make me not like him."
"another fanfic bc not a single sixer fan is solid enough to admit what actually happened  do you remember when joel had to be forced to post bc he was out of shape and falling in love w taking bail out threes and staying on the perimeter? remember when he had to be publicly shamed by shaq and chuck for it?  of course not, you're just a sixer fan. why would you remember that now that it doesnt suit you.  do you remember all those times ben simmons shat on embiid for leading the team in turnovers in the playoffs? 8 in game 7? do you remember all those times ben shat on joel for not losing weight? for not taking his body seriously and getting hurt every postseason?  how about when ben went at doc for his shit rotations, his bad plays, his bad timeouts?  sixer fans are legitimately pathetic. you'll say anything."
"i call lies lies. idgaf about narrative bc there arent competing narratives.  theres what happened and then the bullshit people push.  what happened is that the socialite quote was fake, he said he wanted to go anywhere, and hes improved to the point hes a top 5 defender in the league whos *stayed* an all star and become dpoy worthy guarding 5 positions.  what also happened is that despite embiid fucking up in the exact same ways his entire career but ben never said ""the turning point was when joel thought he was a guard and lost the ball 8 times"" or ""the turning point was when joel had to hit the bench bc hes  not in shape and is also hurt bc of it again""  the only people pushing narratives are philly fans and personnel pretending theyve been nothing but great to ben and hes just being *unreasonable*  its pathetic. you guys cant even keep it real just bc you cant get a proper trade package. bunch of fucking sad sacks."
"Right... but he's just wrong lol the coach literally came out and talked about how Joel isn't in shape to run paint to paint all game for 82 games, so he had plays drawn up where Embiid ends up on the 3 pt line. Not the other way around, like Embiid tries to paint it here.  Joel can say what he wants but he's just being defensive after feeling disrespected. We signed Horford to pair with Joel and Simmons, not just Simmons. Joel has injury problems, and our backup C (greg Monroe) went -8 in &lt;60s against Toronto in game 7. The organization also touted the signing as their Giannis stopper... b/c they honestly believed that roster was in contention for a title lolol   There's plenty to say about Simmons, but trying to say the organization made these decisions solely to build around Ben is just flat out wrong."
Also Embiid is from Cameroon so it's not like Ben can complain Joel gets special treatment for being American. Joel gets treated better because he's the better player AND teammate. Simmons and his camp look more like whining morons everytime they open their mouths.
"Any shooter would obviously fit well with Embiid to space the floor and give him more room in the post.    The problem is that if Ben is gone, Sixers have no real facilitators and the offense will be a grind fraught with turnovers and tough unassisted buckets. What they really need most is an elite perimeter star who can create for everyone else, and make life easier for Joel to score without having to work so hard every possession."
"Yes, Joel Embiid is the #1 guy on the Sixers because Ben Simmons is Australian and too nice.....       Not because Embiid's a top 5 player in the league and Simmons is scared to take a 2 foot shot"
"Yeah totally agree, was the Embiid and Simmons show until this past season where Joel was an MVP candidate and Ben couldn’t make a jump shot"
"can everyone stop lying about embiid changing his style for ben?  joel had to be publicly shamed into going the block and to stop taking bail out threes and floating on the perimeter  the entire narrative for his first years in the league were, ""injury prone, doesnt take care of his body, falling in love w his jumper and handle and playing like a guard but is great when hes aggressive on the block"""
Remember when Joel Embiid was actually depressed two seasons ago because the Sixers traded all of Embiid’s friends off the team to build around Ben Simmons? That’s what real mental anguish is.
"&gt;&gt;Trading for James Harden seems kind of like the opposite of putting all your eggs in the Joel Embiid basket  Yea and it should've been done after the Boston series, injuries or not. Ben clearly was at best a great number 2 because he fears the big games. The Colongelos had way more of a hard on for Simmons, likely because Embiid was clearly Hinkies gamble and they felt like they Simmons was theirs because they picked him. I think it's pretty obvious based on the burner accounts rhetoric. That fucking family is such a plague to today's game"
"&gt;Before the season, Simmons thought he would be traded for Harden. In fact, he was so sure he would be dealt that he went house shopping in Houston. A source said the Simmons camp was even informed by someone in the team that he more than likely would be moved. ""We realized this move was a result of putting all the eggs in Embiid’s basket,” one source said.  Trading for James Harden seems kind of like the opposite of putting all your eggs in the Joel Embiid basket"
"Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.” They know that,” a source said. **“They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.”**"
"Embiid made statements to the contrary on Thursday, telling media members the Sixers’ decision to let Butler leave in a sign-and-trade to the Heat and then sign Al Horford for the 2019-20 season was a mistake. Embiid said the decision was made “just to make sure that [Simmons] needs the ball in his hands.”  Butler went on to have an All-Star campaign in 2019-20 and led the Heat to the NBA Finals in his first season in Miami.  “What Ben can’t be responsible for is the Sixers’ decision to move on from Jimmy,” the source said. “No matter what anybody said.  “This is what the team chose to do. So now when Jimmy goes to the Finals, that’s eggs on your face. That’s not Ben’s fault.” Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021. Ben Simmons (25) shoots as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert (27) defends in the second half during an NBA basketball game on Feb. 15, 2021.Rick Bowmer / AP Showing his worth  To be fair, Embiid is the better player and harder for opponents to scheme against. Simmons is also tougher to build a team around because of his offensive shortcomings. For him to be successful, he has to be surrounded with an army of shooters and a secondary ballhandler.  Yet Simmons still managed to make an important impact with the Sixers.”When Joel has not been durable, Ben’s been durable,” one source said of Embiid also missing time to injuries. “No offense to Joel, he deserves to have the team built around him. They made their bet around Joel, which is fine. He deserves that.”But Simmons has had some of his best games on nights when Embiid has been sidelined.  A prime example was his career-high 42 points to go with 12 assists and nine rebounds while playing center in a 132-124 road loss to the Utah Jazz on Feb. 15. Simmons even made 12 of 13 free throws.Back on Jan. 20, 2020, he had 34 points, 12 assists, 12 rebounds, five steals, and two blocks to lead the Embiid-less Sixers to a 117-111 road victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He made 12 of 14 shots and went 10 of 14 from the foul line while playing multiple positions.  And a source pointed out that Simmons led the Sixers to their final eight victories of the 2017-18 season with Embiid sidelined with a concussion and fracture to the orbital bone near his left eye.  ”They won those games with Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick,” the source said of Simmons’ teammates during the winning streak. “Not James Harden. Not Kevin Durant and Kyrie, LeBron [James] and A.D. [Davis]. It was Marco Belinelli and J.J. Redick only to come back to the same style of play when Embiid returned for the postseason.” Being shopped for James Harden  The 2020-21 NBA season was the most difficult for Simmons, a source says.  Before the season, Simmons thought he would be traded for Harden.  In fact, he was so sure he would be dealt  that he went house shopping in Houston. A source said the Simmons camp was even informed by someone in the team that he more than likely would be moved.  “We realized this move was a result of putting all the eggs in Embiid’s basket,” one source said.  In Harden, the Sixers would have gotten someone to pair with Embiid such as when they had Jimmy Butler, but better. Harden finishes isolation plays by taking opponents off the dribble or burying step-back three-pointers. The Sixers needed someone to strike fear in defenders while making things easier for Embiid.  It didn’t take long for reports to leak that the Sixers were interested in acquiring Harden via a trade for Simmons.  At the time there were reports that Harden’s close friend, Meek Mill, wanted him to play in Philly. Harden and Meek Mill both have a relationship with Sixers minority owner Michael Rubin.  Morey developed a lasting relationship with Harden as Rockets general manager before joining the Sixers. The 2018 MVP, however, got his wish and was traded to the Nets.  Sources believe that Morey was never fully comfortable with Simmons at point guard. A team official refuted the notion that Morey didn’t like Simmons’ game. But other sources said Simmons noticed how Morey reacted during games when displeased with something the player did.  Simmons remained committed to the Sixers throughout the season. He had an ally in coach Doc Rivers, who went to great lengths to defend Simmons in the media. However, folks close to Simmons believe Rivers and Embiid threw him under the bus following the Game 7 loss to the Hawks. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Sixers coach Doc Rivers says he wants Ben Simmons back on the team this season. Elizabeth Robertson / MCT Time to move on  After the series with Atlanta, Simmons informed Paul that he wanted a change of scenery. Paul then told Morey two days later. Then the agent informed Sixers brass in person during a private meeting at the NBA draft combine in Chicago of Simmons’ intent.  In that meeting, a source said Paul told the Sixers that arming them with ample time to find a deal was Simmons’ wish. The source added Paul wasn’t demanding or threatening anything, simply informing them of Simmons’ decision. Paul told the team administrators to stop asking Simmons to be something he’s not and focus on what he’s telling them.  Paul told them, “He’s telling you that ‘I’m not coming to Philadelphia. My time as a 76er is done.’”  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid will be expected to do more on defense for the Sixers without Ben Simmons  The Sixers asked why Simmons wanted out, and Paul informed them that the point guard was mentally exhausted. The source believes they didn’t pay attention to Simmons’ state of mind or feelings about being in Philly because of the four years remaining on his contract.  “The icing on the cake came when Ben told the Sixers brass face-to-face during their August meeting in Los Angeles,” a source said. “He doesn’t have anything personal against Embiid. He also appreciated managing partner Josh Harris, co-managing partner David Blitzer and the organization and what they’ve done. But at the same time, it’s run its course.”  Now even if he does come back to Philadelphia, Simmons still doesn’t intend to play a game.  “You are never getting the same player back in Philly,” a source said. “You definitely are not getting him back in uniform. Even if he was in uniform, you are not getting back the same player.”  A source added that when a player is motivated to come back after defeat, they come back and you just know how motivated they are. Teams don’t need to convince them to return.  “You don’t have to ask and go searching,” the source said. “And when they don’t want to be somewhere, they tell you it ain’t going to work.”  Well, Simmons is speaking loud and clear."
"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer’s newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons’ availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly — and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season’s $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons’ absence: It’s ‘borderline kind of disrespectful’  The Sixers’ position that they’re not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They’re trying to win a championship, and believe they’re in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who’s in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren’t as blindsided by Simmons’ desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons’ trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons’ camp don’t believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they’re just determined to do it on their terms. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta. Sixers guard Ben Simmons dribbles the basketball against Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of the NBA Eastern Conference playoff semifinals on Friday, June 18, 2021 in Atlanta.YONG KIM / Staff Photographer Destined for a messy divorce  Publicly, the Sixers talk about wanting Simmons to return and be part of a championship team in Philly. The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.”  “They know that,” a source said. “They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.” Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can’t blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can’t blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  “But that doesn’t negate that the relationship is done,” another source said. “This is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That’s what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it’s not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.”  » READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers’ starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers’ tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons’ skills was more lovely, it’s hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers’ lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly’s steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn’t honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  “This entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,” a source said. “It’s not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It’s not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. …. It’s never been smooth at all.”  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player’s former team got worse. That’s something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid’s squad, not Simmons’ team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team’s go-to player.  “What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. “I’m just [speaking] facts. But because he’s Australian, because he’s a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.”"
"Regular season games missed in the last five years and respective ages:  * Anthony Davis - 83 games missed, 28 years old  * Kawhi Leonard - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * Steph Curry - 115 games missed, 34 years old  * Joel Embiid - 131 games missed , 27 years old  * Kevin Durant - 147 games missed, 33 years old"
"That’s a fine take, I get it.  I just think we don’t know shit and Daryl Morey, a goddamn professional, had and has his reasons and had and has a strategy.  Granted, that doesn’t mean this ever turns out “okay to good” for the Sixers.  But I profoundly doubt anything on offer for Ben in July and August was anything close to making them a contender while Joel Embiid walks this earth.  At this point, I’m fine with seeing what crazy shit the next few months brings and seeing Morey do his damnedest to take advantage of it, a thing most would agree he does as well as anyone in sports."
"The problem with Ben Simmons was always shooting, he had an all round game except scoring. Hes the opposite from most players that come to the draft. But he never developed his shot and worked on the rest of his game. I had arguments with people IRL about this and they couldnt accept that a PG like Magic couldnt work but they failed to recognise todays game.  The 76ers are built around Ben Simmons and Embiid. Joel can shoot and he can work in the post and adds range to the team while Ben is the play maker and the key defender on the perimeter. There is no player in the last 5-10 years you could replace Ben Simmons with other than Rajon Rondo who would fit perfectly with what they are doing. If Ben wasnt a cunt and pulled a finger out they would have won last year but he did the same thing he did in his first playoff run."
"I think Daryl Morey knows how to maximize his assets, he did it for years in Houston and has been a GM of 15+ years. The deal just wasn't out there, nobody wanted to give up much for a guy who shot 33% in the playoffs. The wrong move, is to trade him for a role player and a few picks just because you don't want him on the team anymore. Trust me, trading him for peanuts sets us back much farther than any other scenario. It wasn't that we were passing up trades, it's that the trades just weren't there. We haven't heard all summer of a worthwhile move outside maybe Brogdon.   Really not sure why people paint Ben as having leverage and the sixers being the ones to panic. We'll be fine, Ben is an unwanted asset with 4 years left on his deal, sitting out is pretty much the only thing he can do besides pulling a Jimmy Butler. Only way Ben's value increases is through time passing and another team becoming desperate to upgrade (specifically on defense). Really don't think there's a clean break timeline anywhere after we lost so badly to the Hawks.  I can understand thinking we won't get a better deal, but I don't understand our players getting upset or going to management and forcing them to make a move. We're doing what is in our best interest with long term planning in mind. Riding out half a season isn't nothing, but it also isn't throwing away a good Joel Embiid year. Running it back with this team and Buddy Hield, now THAT is how you piss off Joel and make the team worse."
Joel Embiid is the Goat
"I think there’s some truth to this, but only to a certain extent. Obviously it’d be great if Rudy had a good post up game, but the level it would have to be at in order to stop small ball would be ridiculously high. The clips had an orating of 128 in the second round. Joel Embiid is hands down the best post up player in the league and he averages 1.08 points per post up. Not even prime Shaq was efficient enough to keep up with the clips offense. At some point our permitted defenders have to stay in front of their man and not just allow free dribble penetration every possession."
"he came out and said he doesn't want to play with Joel Embiid anymore because his game is incompatible.  Joel is a top 5 player in the league and one of the most versatile big men of all time.  Like if you can't play with Joel, who they hell can you play with."
The worst starter or bench player eats what the nutrition staff tells them.   Joel Embiid eats what he fucking wants.
"What the fuck are the Sixers gonna do with Malik Beasley and 2-3 firsts from Minnesota? Lose in the second round again at best? The point is to not waste Embiid’s prime, that’s the **entire reason** the Sixers have the worse hand. If the return we get for Ben doesn’t help us not waste Embiid, we might as well start fielding offers for Joel."
"&gt;Ben Simmons is the difference between the one seed and being just another fringe playoff team.  I'm seeing our Over/Under this year consistently above 50 wins, some of that of course factors in trading Simmons and getting some return, but this is not supposed to be a fringe playoff team  &gt;You'd be one Joel Embiid injury away from no playoffs.  And if he's injured we're probably not doing much in the playoffs anyway"
"https://www.phillyvoice.com/joel-embiid-conditioning-training-camp-2020-personal-chef-doc-rivers-0599970/amp/  Embiid didnt have his own nutritionist 3 years ago.  The best you can do is make personal ""attacks"". Best I can do is facts and evidence.  Dont even need to make petty, baseless assumption the way you do. You go *just* for the low hanging fruit. That's easy to do. Try to refute intelligently, if you can.  I dont expect you to understand this, but telling me I'm frustrated is not indicative of reality. It's just what youd prefer to think lol"
"If Joel Embiid tried to fight me, I think my best strategy would be to try to crawl between his legs and hope that, while he's bending over the grab me and whoop my ass, he throws out his back."
He can just show up and suck for the duration of his contract and still be set for life.  The 76ers have a finite window to build a team around Joel Embiid. Dude has major injury concerns. If they waste it with Simmons either doing nothing or actively trying to lose them games they'll waste their entire window.
Joel Embiid: The Iron Man
"Not sure what you're saying. Of course he's not going to play here again, we're just waiting for the trade market to warm up sometime between now and the deadline. It's not an issue that needs to be resolved ASAP, we're still a playoff team with Joel Embiid, so I'm saying if you have a worse record for 20-30 games it's not going to ruin your season."
"im not gonna reiterate what i said joel embiid is a 5 year nba player &amp; a 4 time all star he has a personal trainer, a nutritionist, a physical therapy staff &amp; much more   you googling what to eat before running or weightlifting is N/A and incomparable make the league then come back and tell me i’ll side with you undoubtedly but until then ur point is irrelevant"
Joel Embiid has honestly grown into one of the most incredible media guys. I have gained a ton of respect for him with how he's handled this whole situation.
"Snap poll:  *How hard of a foul will Simmons receive from Embiid when he goes for a layup? Let's assume for the sake of argument that he doesn't pass it to someone who's double-covered.*  1) McHale-on-Rambis  2) 80s Pistons  3) Flagrant  4) Hello, my name is Joel"
"To a degree, but Embiid needs to own his poor play too. The Sixers lost to the Hawks because both Ben and Joel weren't as good as they needed to be in the series. Simmons deserves more of the blame but Embiid was out right bad in the second half of G4, didn't get it done in G5 and was underwhelming again in the second hald, and had a horrendous turnover in G7 which effectively ended the Sixers season. If he's your best player, that isn't going to get it done... scapegoating Simmons or not."
"I'm a sixers fan. Posted this in another thread and figure it was appropriate here as well:   Honestly hoping the team and org goes to war with Klutch over this bullshit for the year. If you don't want to play here than dont sign a 5 year contract..  The teams championship window is likely closed (with or without simmons) unless they can somehow fetch a star or Maxey becomes an All star immediately. Neither of these are likely.  At this point I just hope Embiid has a 'Westbrook-esque' MvP season where he carries our bum squad to a 5 or 6 seed. I care less about winning a championship and more about ensuring embiid is remembered as one of the great bigs of this era.   I will say this. I am looking forward to going back to watching a Sixers season with zero expectations. The past few years of being a 'contender' have honestly been exhausting lmao.   Excited to watch Joel, excited to watch Maxey, excited to watch Simmons lose money and HOPEFULLY watch Klutch lose SOME control they have over the league. This is the 2nd time in 3 offseasons that they have blatantly fucked with the Sixers franchise and its beyond exhausting to think about"
Ben Simmons is the difference between the one seed and being just another fringe playoff team.  You'd be one Joel Embiid injury away from no playoffs.
"One more reason for me to hate Ben Simmons is that he's made me side with, and almost like, Joel Embiid. God damn it."

"Well if you’re actually asking, Noel could easily have been the backup center for JoJo in a Dwight type role so drafting Joel made sense. MCW was seen as a jack of all trades and was pretty decent his rookie year but never put it together. Saric was a floor spacing 4 that spread the floor for jo, mcw and nerlens.   Jah was an insurance policy in case Embiid couldn’t stay healthy (and tbf, at the time he genuinely looked like one of the best players in the draft to a lot of people).   Simmons was supposed to be MCW 2.0, which he was but Philly hopefuls planned on him to improve his shot over his career which was clearly never gonna happen.   Fultz was supposed to be the first true actual point guard with a jumpshot that would allow Ben to move down to the 4 spot so you can’t run traditional basketball actions like the p&amp;r with a player who teams don’t even defend on the perimeter in Ben.   So overall, assuming they kept all the guys, a hypothetical lineup would’ve looked something like   Fultz  Sg  Sf   Ben/Saric  Embiid/Noel  With okafor being the odd man out at the end of the rotation. It actually would’ve been pretty decent had fultz not forgotten how to shoot"
Joel Embiid DEFINITELY had a pregame meal
"I fucking love joel embiid. He said awhile back they love you, then they hate you, but i promise you embiid i will always have your back."
"Yeah Joel seems like a pretty cerebral guy, it's hard to see how he would turn on Morey. He understands the situation they're in. Idk though if I'm right, it's not like I know Embiid lol"
"&gt;Well, I do agree with you on Westbrook and Butler, I'm sure Pat Beverly is included as if I get you right that the ones that leave it all on the floor. No questions asked.   It's moreso the about the dudes who live the game 24/7 and do everything they can off the court to just make the baseline of what they are supposed to be on the court. Ben Simmons was never that guy. He got by on privilege of coming from a pro sports family with his own undeniable skillset, but you could tell he never had that dog in him to push him into being a potential MVP candidate and on the list of greatest of all time.  If I get the gist of what you are saying about how Ben Simmons is being treated by the media, I kind of have to disagree with you. I would say the opposite in the sense that (and I've been saying this for literally years) - - PHI has never been a contender. Joel Embiid is just now coming into the monster that he is and every season before this one he was always a casualty in regards to injuries and just being soft in general. Ben Simmons was ALWAYS media hype. He was the Australian darling boy that the league used to help push their marketing across seas (which worked very well) - - but the core duo of Embiid and Simmons was never a threat to legit teams in the east like BOS, TOR, MIL, MIA and I feel like I'm missing some others over the years. The media hyped up PHI and Ben Simmons since the ""Trust the Process"" days which in itself, tanking is a losing mentality so of course they are going to get some overhyped non-superstar who doesn't want to take the game of basketball to the next level.  So the media in essence is now just showing their hypocrisy. Don't get me wrong, sports media is a business and marketing is a viable and much needed aspect of the business. And in this respect, I'd also like to say (and this is much more debatable than Ben Simmons imo) that another example of this overhyped marketing is Giannis. Giannis imo has never been the best player in the league in any of the seasons he won MVP (but ironically, I would say he was probably the best player this year, even though somebody else won MVP). Giannis was never a better player than KD, LeBron, Harden, Steph in those MVP years but because of the marketing strategy they had to crown somebody and so Giannis ends up with 3 MVP's and a DPOY (nah). Ben Simmons was just another international guy that the league was trying to prop up as a future MVP for international marketing purposes. And while I don't feel the same about Luka who really is a potential GOAT, you also see the same thing with Luka in MVP talks even though his team isn't quite good enough for him to run away as a candidate, but they are still going to hype him up as if they are a top team in the league.  So nah I don't really think he is being 'dog piled' on - - I think the NBA media brass is having to answer for their own hype train that they took a bad gamble on."
Embiid get what ever he could to jell with Simmons.  Simmons is a huge disappointment.  There was so much praise for his versatility when Ben  first became a Sixers in 2016 in the first round draft picks.  Of course Joel was a 1st round draft pick to that year.   But he turned out to be such a great center.
Exactly. I thought you guys would beat the Bucks or Nets almost solely because of the advantage Joel has against them. Having Jimmy be that 2nd guy and an outlet of pressure off Embiid I could definitely have seen it.
Joel Embiid is my favorite and my least favorite is definitely Lebum James

Joel “we do a little trolling”Embiid
"&gt; He himself has adjusted his playstyle to accommodate Ben  I think this is true but I also think that Ben and Joel are fundamentally a poor fit together. Simmons really needs a fast, motion offence to thrive in and Embiid is a major ball stopper (that's not a criticism).  It does seem like Simmons has failed to adapt or improve the parts of his game that could change this though."
"Joel Embiid is so childish, how can people stand his bullshit? First of all, he has let his team down many times in the playoffs because he wasn’t in good enough shape. So how the fuck is he gonna throw shade at Ben? How is the team built around Ben if the team is hellbent on GETTING RID OF BEN?"
I like Joel Embiid.
Joel Embiid really coming off good in this whole situation. He's reinforcing the fact that Ben Simmons is acting like a clown in this but he's being very civil with it all. It'd be so easy for Embiid to rip into Simmons after all the disrespect but he's just spitting facts.  Can't wait to see the end of this. What team is going to destroy their locker room? What does this year look like for Simmons? He's going to have *immense* pressure on him to perform after all this.  2021-22 bout to be a juicy season.
"Good for Joel for speaking out a little; he's been very patient with this situation. Simmons' trade value isn't getting much if any lower and his relationship with Philadelphia is beyond repair, so might as well answer some questions at this point.  Hopefully the next point guard Embiid plays with can shoot and be effective in a half-court offense."
Ben Simmons is better than Joel Embiid
"There is a 0% chance that the wolves would go “you know what, Joel is mad at Ben. We should only offer a first instead of a first and Beasley.” The Sixers hold Ben for 4 years. Until Joel demands the team trade Ben, Ben’s “value” is his worth as a basketball player. As long as the sixers don’t have an imperative to sell, there’s no reason logically to trade Ben any earlier than the deadline or maybe even next offseason. Admittedly, by then the ticking clock on Embiid will force the sixers to sell and at that point they should cut their losses. But a star may request out by then, and that chance is worth burning this season as long as Embiid is okay with that. Of course, if Embiid says Ben has to go, then yeah the sixers will have to settle for whatever. Also, what packages would be better than the sixers’? Idk if the Celtics would give up jaylen brown or the nuggets MPJ and I don’t think teams like Houston or NO fit the timeline of a 30+ year old superstar. The sixers package could reasonably compete with anything"
"True, but Morey had the opportunity to pair Joel Embiid with James Harden and let that slip because he didn’t want to include 2 more assets.   And Houston ended up with an awful team that landed them Jalen Green. Philly lost."
It's weird because Joel was said to have said that he doesn't like playing with Ben and he shot that down while also lecturing the fans on not believing everything that you read because of how much stuff is taken out of context and how much is straight up made up.   Then he reacts this way to a report that Ben says he can't play with Embiid because he clogs the paint (paraphrasing).   Not saying Joel is wrong or he hasn't been mostly professional throughout all of this but it is interesting to note his reaction on the backdrop of his comments about a month ago.
"Ben is a massive diva but the Sixers set the expectation when they gave him a max with no performance clauses after a year of no growth, his abysmal interview answers, and treating him like the Batman when Embiid is clearly better.   It's like a parent with a defiant teenager. Yes, at that age the teen should learn how to behave respectfully but if the parent sets the expectation in childhood and decides to ignore their child's faults, they can't act surprise when the child grows into a disrespectful adult.  The backpedalling is pathetic. Now Morey is trying to upsell Ben as a star like the rest of the league doesn't have eyes and Doc and Joel are making it obvious they are 100 percent done with and over the pattern of coddling Ben."
"This vid makes the rounds every week, gets 500+ upvotes, a hundred comments calling book some variation of ""a bitch"", ""lame"", ""that's why he failed in the finals"", it's all the same slanderous crap every time. Like imagine if the most random comment from your favorite player gets blown out of proportion and is continuously used as fuel to slander them. You'd think it was not only weird, but downright pathetic and delusional.   Like there was this one open gym I remember where Joel Embiid was punking the crap out of Mo Bamba talking mad shit. Imagine if every week Reddit was like ""Joel Embiid's such a dick, look how he's talking to this young player, he's not welcoming"""
"Clint Capela on Joel Embiid: ""Whenever you wear him out, everything becomes tougher for him. When the fatigue comes in, it's a different ballgame.""Jun 15, 2021"
"Why would they ""orchestrate"" demanding a trade to Sacramento or Minnesota when he already has Joel Embiid on his team?"
"https://www.si.com/nba/76ers/news/ben-simmons-feels-doc-rivers-reprimanded-controversial-comment  It does seem to be an issue. And the media and this sub has played it up.  But it also seems that it isn't the only problem, with Simmons reportedly saying his game doesn't mesh well   https://sports.yahoo.com/ben-simmons-reportedly-doesnt-want-to-play-with-joel-embiid-anymore-141951177.html"
"&gt;Whatever way you cut, it makes no good sense why doc and Joel did that  Frustration cause the guy getting paid $33M (more than Embiid) hasn't done shit to become a better player and isn't going to learn anything from getting embarrassed yet again."
Idk why the rest of the team got a pass for that. It was pretty much 1 vs 5 with Joel embiid being the only one showing any heart for the 76ers
"Remove Trae, Jimmy &amp; Embiid Add AD Dame  To clarify on Joel - I think he’s the better player 100% and better franchise cornerstone as of now but if we’re talking strictly Playoffs, I’m taking Tatum.  and that’s my list."
"When you want to trade someone, you want their trade value to be as high as possible. Embiid and Doc throwing him under the bus absolutely hurt the trade value, you don't just alienate your own player like that. It pushed Ben to request a trade  Whatever way you cut, it makes no good sense why doc and Joel did that"
Yes but Jaren Jackson isn’t close to Joel Embiid lol.    His defense was not very good his 2nd year in the league.
How healthy a player is ≠ who is better  MPJ is healthier than Joel Embiid but is not better  Hope this is easy to understand
" &gt; “He is in great shape,” Rivers told reporters on Wednesday. “He’s in much better shape which is great because last year, he took a big step in conditioning, and then this year, he comes and he’s in even better shape.”  &gt;In the early part of training camp, Rivers wants to get the Sixers on the same page with Embiid when it comes to late-game situations. They need to be able to execute enough to get the job done and get the shots that they want.  &gt;”Early on, Joel does what he does,” he continued. “He’s kind of trying to keep everybody involved. We’re working on end of the game stuff. I thought you know it’s funny I record a lot of close games. I didn’t think under 40 seconds, we necessarily got the shots we wanted every time. So we’re really working on that this year. We want to make sure we get the shot we want every single time down the stretch. So we put a lot of work in there.”"

"Ummmm. Does Joel Embiid ring a bell. I'm not saying their talent level is equivalent, but if you are good teams will pay you, and hope that you will stay healthy."
CJ with Embiid is a hell of a lot better than Simmons with Embiid. CJ will space the floor for Joel and can get a tough bucket on his own.
"&gt; even if Dame wanted out you really think he'd want to go to Philly?   Uh, yes. They have Joel Embiid."
Joel Embiid literally can do everything. If you cant match with him then you cant match with anyone.
"He does have some post moves, but he doesn’t use them much. When he came into the league he posted up a lot, but it wasn’t very efficient (his first year Rudy was only 48% from the field as opposed to his current 68%). Cutting that out was a big step to him becoming a better player. The reality is that unless you’re Joel Embiid or can pass out of the post like Jokic, posting up is just not a smart way of playing basketball in 2021. Even a super skilled big in KAT only averaged .88 points per possession on post ups last year. That’s dreadful offense and I’m glad Rudy is no longer trying to force that."
I can't believe Ben Simmons would sit out training camp and miss all the comedy and shenanigans that is happening right now! Imagine Ben on the other side of Embiid and he refuses an extended arm from Joel
"OFCOURSE he is. Ben offence goes off a cliff 5 feet from the basket! Joel Embiid, a 28 and 10 center who was in the contention for MVP last year, who can shoot from the 3 point range and can shoot 84% from the free throw line. He's also one of the most dominant players in the paint.   He should have changed his game."
"Its very simple. Embiid cannot play many more post possessions than he already does. Its too taxing on the body. He already posts up more than entire teams in the league. If hes going to produce more its going to be from the perimeter with improved passing and shooting. With Simmons out of the lane, Joel is as good as anyone at triple threat basketball which also allows him to drive the ball, and makes him a far better passer than just playing with his butt on the block.   He has said it, his teammates have, his coaches have. You cant just run through 3 guys on every play for 70-100 games."
Apparently Joel Embiid is the main reason for his shit free throw percentage too
"you think that the best use for Joel Embiid is a stretch big? Yeah he *can* shoot and he *will* shoot, but he is most effective down low, first, with the threat of shooting second. This attack is made significantly harder next to players like Ben Simmons or Draymond Green etc. Ben standing in the lane reduces Joel Embiids potential, its not rocket science."
"I like Ben as a talent and think he has definitely made mistakes but Doc Rivers mismanaged this whole thing. Joel Embiid hasn’t helped as well. This party is over and they need to part ways.   And yeah for the anti Simmons crowd, after this move the entirety of the pressure and scrutiny will go on him and rightfully so"
"I mean, this is true. And we've been hearing it from multiple sources for a long time. In example, Jalen Rose has been tooting this horn for years.  That being said, Joel Embiid isn't the reason that during multiple playoff games Ben Simmons didn't attempt a shot in the fourth quarter."
Joel Embiid was MVP runner up to Nikola fucking Jokic. Get outta here with your stupid opinion.
"I think that's a product of a gap in the U.S. system of developing big men rather than Europe being especially good at it, since big men with unique skills isn't unique to Europe (see: Joel Embiid), and they're still producing strong players outside of the C (Fournier, both Bogdanovics, Luka) and Clint Capela has a pretty traditional skillset."
"Ben Simmons is just saying what everyone has been seeing the last couple years but he's getting so much hate lmao. Joel Embiid is too slow. The Modern NBA is just going to pass around and shoot. If it was 2005 then maybe this 76ers team is a contender with Joel Embiid. There is no room in the NBA for a slow, skilled big man. The Nuggets got whooped. The Lakers got whooped. And so did the 76ers. All teams with with Tall, slow, skilled big men. It's just not conducive to playoff basketball. But everyone keep going off on Ben Simmons..."
Meltzer: “Joel Embiid **SHOOTS HARD** on Ben Simmons”
"Also, side note: Joel Embiid has radically adjusted how he approaches the game for Ben Simmons and is actually one of the top 5 or so centers to pair with him? Hard to find a 7 footer who only shoots but still plays defensive 5. Jokic maybe the only option, but jokic needs the shooting around him too"
"ie when Embiid was sitting the team was Simmons, shooters and a good veteran center.  when Ben was sitting it was Joel, shooters and no one to distribute  The team was built around Simmons just as much as it was built around Joel. They actually need similar pieces around them to thrive, Simmons himself would've benefitted greatly from an additional veteran distributor on the court at all times if he would've accepted a different role."
"Pink ball. All out Joel Embiid, 48 minutes a game, never tired, can't get injured? That'd be insanity.   I don't give one shit about what happens with Simmons in that scenario."
"Could not find counting stats, only net ratings  &gt;Since 2018 (according to nbawowy):  &gt;Ben Simmons without Joel Embiid (3359 minutes) -3.3 net rating   &gt;Joel Embiid with Ben Simmons (4059 minutes) +10.4 net rating  &gt;Joel Embiid without Ben Simmons (2023 minutes) +6 net rating  &gt;Last season:  &gt;Ben Simmons without Joel Embiid (801 minutes) -4 net rating  &gt;Joel Embiid with Ben Simmons (1479 minutes) +16.3 net rating   &gt;Joel Embiid without Ben Simmons (463 minutes) +1.4 net rating  https://twitter.com/darealbootum/status/1442884510677233666?s=21"
He literally said the team gets worse because Embiid such a good player but Simmons improves because he’s a bad fit with Joel
"While Embiid was dropping 40 pts and 15 rebounds on a torn meniscus....and Ben wants to say that he can't play with him.   If Ben had half the heart, drive and courage that Joel has, we'd have a title by now."
"Joel ""The man at the grassy knoll"" Embiid."
"""And then one day I renounced Joel Embiid"""
"you cant talk about Joel ""The processs"" Embiid like that, if philly wasnt done with Ben before they are now, yeesh"
"It's actually hilarious Ben is saying he won't change his game for Embiid. Joel has consistently made concessions to the team to change his game to better fit in Simmons. And now that's Ben's reason for wanting to leave, just lmao.   Ben is essentially saying that he doesn't want to actually play point guard here."
"Now he does cause this situation has lasted so long and he wants to be gone sooner rather than later. When he asked for the trade he specified he wanted to be in California (except sac for some reason).  I didn’t say just shut up and play. You can say what you want. Be vocal about your displeasure and public about your trade demands. But do your damn job and play like other professional athletes do. He’s literally not within his right to pull this childish shit. It’s breaking his contract. Which is why if he does continue to sit he’ll get fined significantly. It’s 3 mill just for missing training camp, let alone the actual season.  And Philly has backed him up nonstop for years. The team has been very active in free agency and the trade market to make better teams around Ben. Joel Embiid has accommodated bens game and honed his jumper to account for his weaknesses. The team gave him a max contract out of pure trust in him as a player. Then after his complete lack of offensive improvement since his rookie year resulted in another disappointing round 2 exit , and he refused to take accountability, he was put in trade talks like every player is at some point. Doc made one vague and honest comment about him. That’s all. The organization treated him incredibly well. Everything they did is standard nba front office stuff. Ben is just acting like an entitled diva about everything"

I love Joel Embiid
A great political matchup by Joel the Politician Embiid
The sixer offence is night and day. Instead of having Joel start dribble hand-offs they have Embiid at the high post cashing jumpers all-day. Imagine if they switched out Brett Brown during the Jimmy season. They may have had a shot at the chip

"Ben Simmons: ""I scored 42!""  Joel Embiid: ""Hold my Shirley Temple"""
"&gt;he can get his own shot and he does space the floor off the ball  yes but from areas that Sixers don't need any more shots from. Embiid already scores a million points from mid-range and paint. and the spacing he provides is less than you would think by looking at his percentages because he just turns down so many 3's. he's somehow taking less 3's than he did last year like how is that even possible.   Sixers are something like 5th in mid-range shots and 28th in 3PA, just very archaic and caps the ceiling offensively. swap Tobias with like, Rozier, and shot chart would start making sense.  &gt;but since he’s not very good in PnR and can’t create for others very well all he’s doing is checking “scoring and spacing” boxes for the sixers but not actually gelling with Simmons and Emboid to create something greater then all the individual parts  that's exactly it. he's not making up for the skills Joel/Ben lack and he doesn't maximize them in any way."
"as a nets fan, i’m kinda concerned about matching up against the sixers in the playoffs, joel embiid is gonna kill us down low lmao"
Lol we both know Joel Embiid is by far the biggest part of that success.

"&gt;Joel Embiid reportedly is known among Chinese fans as “The Great Emperor.”  Umm, why am I just hearing of this? This is incredible"
"Oh Joel for sure. Centers are almost always more valuable to a defense than a wing player. It's why Marc Gasol won it when he wasn't even the most dominant defender on his own team (Tony Allen). He was significantly more important tho.  &amp;#x200B;   I get Giannis is a good defender, but the dude wouldn't take on Butler last season in pivotal situations. Vs Kawhi Embiid defended him as best as you possibly could and took that match up away from Simmons by sheer force of will."
Joel Embiid needs to get his back sorted before anything happens
"Joel might be unstoppable against them, but he’s gonna be played off the floor against their 5-out sets. Capela, one of the faster and more agile true centers, was abused the entire game against that set, and Embiid is significantly bigger, so the nets will 100% take advantage"
"Yeah joel embiid looked off, has looked off since imo"
Giannis is absolutely not a better defender than Joel Embiid.
Nah he is not on the same level of talent as Luka. That's more for someone like... idk maybe Joel Embiid :D
"Ben Simmons is playing out of his mind defense, and Joel Embiid got in shape and is absolutely brutalizing guys on the block. That team has taken a leap my man. I Boo Philly until my voice gives out like any other green blooded Celtics fan, but to say that Philly is worried if you've watched any of their games this season is absolutely ludicrous."
"No, I think he has a better case than Sabonis, arguable with vucevic, but Vucevic is producing on a team that has been blasted by injuries and is just generally worse than the Knicks (they might have the worst point guard situation in the NBA).  Aside from that, I would have him behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton, and Giannis. That would have him at like 7th or 8th in the eastern conference frontcourt, so no, I don't think he deserves to be an all-star."
"I dont see this as a question really. Jokic and its not even close untill Embiid shows up like Joker did in playoffs. Heck ill take Joker over Giannis rn for that reason. You guys put too much on regular season, its like asking if Harden or Giannis are better than Lebron. Silly. Joker is a 1 man offense, more clutch than Joel. Better post game, touch, passing. Rebounding is about the same. Joel is a better defender but i dont see him locking Jokic at all."
"The stats mean nothing when you’re relating it to game script especially in regards to best and most consistent teams in the league. The Nets have underperformed since the Harden trade. I find it easy to look at stats and prove the narrative you more pushing but a Lebron/Joel Embiid have had a better year and bigger impact, as has a Nikola Jokic, Stephen Curry, or even Paul George when he’s not busy dealing with COVID issues. So those stats are impressive for sure but you’re not gonna tell me that Domantas Sabonis hasn’t meant more to his team than Harden has at this gesture which is what MVP awards are mostly tailored around."
"What do you mean 'what are you talking about'? I literally quoted *your* Head Coach. Are you denying what *your* own Head Coach said about your team? Do you know better? Are you Sixers fans that fucking delusional? My lord  Doc said 'COVID has nothing to do with it', so Imma take his word for it.  So going by your narrative, they rested Ben and Joel while all the plebs were forced to play in a game they had no chance of winning without their 2 best players? Because that just makes Embiid sound like a shitty teammate and explains why his MVP case is weaker if he unilaterally chooses to sit out games he feels like. He did the same vs the Jazz with no COVID protocol revolving the team at all too, so there's a pattern.  Also, pretty sure this game was long before Bron tried to assassinate Embiid, so he doesn't have the injury excuse unless he was actually injured before the Laker game."
"Don't call that one out, lmao  [https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/02/15/sixers-big-man-joel-embiid-to-play-vs-jazz-after-being-listed-as-questionable/](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2021/02/15/sixers-big-man-joel-embiid-to-play-vs-jazz-after-being-listed-as-questionable/)  Doc was sure Embiid was gonna play and there was no issue, but then came up to him before the game and said he'd sit this one out. Did the same vs Jokic even tho he cleared COVID protocols"
It’s actually insane to me that you’re trying to defend LeBron literally shoving Embiid midair with both hands. Joel does play with reckless abandon sometimes but that fall was 100% LeBron’s fault
"Not only that, but Embiid was really *that* hurt from just that Bron assassination attempt he'd be sitting out on a load managed schedule, but he seems to be deliberately not playing games against marquee Centers (while healthy) while playin every game in between  Even tho he wasn't on the COVID protocol he dodged the Jokic Nuggets game and then recently dodged the Gobert Jazz game. Apparently Doc told the media Embiid was gonna play with the full understanding he was healthy but Joel made the decision to sit out that particular game but play all other easy matchups... lmao  [https://twitter.com/tribjazz/status/1361473564600270848](https://twitter.com/tribjazz/status/1361473564600270848)  Scary ass Embiid   But Sixers fans get irrationally angry when you try to refute their conspiracy theory that LeBron orchestrated this entire MVP candidacy by infiltrating the evil mainstream media and assassinating Joel Embiid..."
Lebron needs to stop pushing Joel Embiid when he’s in mid air if he wants to win mvp
"He's also cool with Embiid shooting midrange jumper because it needs to be an option that the defense respects if Joel is going to play out of the mid and high post - which Morey wants him to do because it generates so many high quality looks. Even if Embiid was hitting them at a godly rate, he'd still be taking them."
He’s had back issues before he even played against the Lakers this season  https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/76ers-joel-embiid-out-due-to-back-tightness/    https://www.inquirer.com/sixers/philadelphia-sixers-nba-joel-embiid-detroit-pistons-20210125.html
Joel embiid
"Nets are 18-12.   I’m not saying availability hurts the case, but we are getting to see how much Joel does for this team. Not many players carry the load on both ends. We are pretty much inept without him (except when Simmons decides to actually score).   If the Sixers end up as the 1 seed I think it has to be Embiid. Partially voter fatigue (I know LeBron hasn’t won it in a while, but still) and if the Jazz stay at the top then LeBron can’t even have the best in the West argument. It’s more of a team award than it should be. Davis is on a different level than Simmons when he gives a shit, I think supporting cast does play a bit of a role too."
Doc rivers tried closing a game with Morris at the 5 vs Joel Embiid last year....and then basically never did it again the rest of the year   I like the idea of bev/batum/PG/Kawhi/Morris and they put batum on KAT in a game last week doubling when needed and it worked. But 74% shooting allowed at the rim with Morris at the 5 just turning anybody who comes inside into Zion Williamson lol.

"Yes, Julius Randle is doing well, but this isn’t even a sample size problem - it’s completely cherry-picked and relies on the fact that Randle plays a shitload of minutes on a .500 team in the East.  AD has been injured and is the 2nd guy on an actual championship team in the West while Randle is sharing the ball on a .500 team in the East with RJ Barrett and Elfrid Payton.   Per 36: AD 24.7 Randle 22.6  Joel Embiid is playing 32 mpg.   Per 36: Embiid 12 Randle 10.8  Lillard attempts 2.4x more 3’s a game on a team where he basically goes down in a hail of gunfire every night.  Is it more valuable when someone plays more minutes?   Absolutely.  Will AD and Embiid play Randle’s minutes in the playoffs?  Yes."
"Point Center, Joel ""We live in a society"" Embiid with 9 AST. Best passing center in the league."
This looks really similar to that block Giannis had on Embiid 2 years ago. Joel wreaking vengeance on the Rockets!  [what I’m talking about](https://youtu.be/0ocqBqtaKC4)
"All these damn injuries this season and ones that’s messing up great matchups   No Conley, PG or Kawhi tonight  No KD or AD tommorow  No Joel Embiid yesterday"
"Firstly, when you take his playmaking into account his offense is elite. ""Very good"" is not an insult but still selling him short on that end.   Secondly, yeah this has always been my belief, and not just as it relates to Jokic. Your center needs to be good at defense or you need a bunch of defenders to cover that up for him. I read a stat a week or so ago (not sure if it's still accurate) that said the Nuggets actually have a better defensive rating with him off the court. That cannot happen. Especially since he is so vital to their offense that they barely know how to function without him. He needs to be (and to his credit, is) on the court most of the time for them to have a chance to win most games.   Some centers have trouble protecting the rim, others have trouble with the pick and roll forcing them to defend in space. Jokic is bad at both. The only thing he's really good at is post defense which unfortunately most teams don't even post players up anymore so it's the least useful defensive skill.   I'm gonna get downvotes because I'm criticizing Jokic, and I'm gonna get more because I'm a Sixers fan criticizing Jokic, but I am actually very impressed with what he's done this year. In the past I couldn't figure out when looking at his scoring and assists numbers why he was treated as an offensive phenom but Ben Simmons was treated so poorly on that end. He scored a few points more and got a few fewer assists than Ben but most considered him in another world entirely. Nuggets fans argued that his shooting percentages were so good that he could raise his scoring if he wanted to, which I found absurd. If he could raise them he would. That's the difference between a guy who scores 9 points a game hitting corner threes at 45% and a JJ Redick who shoots a ton but may shoot a lower percentage. To his credit this year he's upped his game tremendously, blowing his previous scoring output out of the water while even raising his assists in the process. Basically this is the player I've been hearing about for two years.   Still though, personally you can have a point guard run the offense and make plays. Having that from your center position is an amazing luxury that makes them unique, but it is a luxury. It is not optional for your center to protect the rim, it is a necessity. Embiid and Jokic are both elite on offense but Joel is one of the two best rim protectors on defense. I know he's my guy and all but I don't even know how this is a question tbh.   Jokic is second on my MVP list btw. There's a gap between Embiid and Jokic's stats and everyone else besides maybe Curry."
Joel “I’m just here so I won’t get fined” Embiid
"&gt;Ben is NOT a scorer.  There is not being a scorer, and there is being unable to score.   &gt;i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him  Why would anyone want to expend the resources to trade for him, eat his massive contract, and then some more resources on top of that for ""the team around him""  &gt;rather than Joel Embiid  Won't a team with Simmons on it always be built around someone else since he can't be the primary star?  &gt; whatever team Ben Simmons goes to will need to build a lineup full of shooters that can hide Ben’s lack of a jumpshot  You mean like Seth Curry, Danny Green, Tobias Harris, George Hill, Joel Embiid, Furkan Korkmaz, Isiah Joe, and Shake Milton... all of whom are 35%+ plus 3PT shooters, most of whom are ~40%+ shooters....  &gt;hich would open up the lane for Ben **to drive and then either finish** or kick it out to a shooter.  They can already do this and Ben doesn't because he knows he's gonna get hacked at miss more FTs."
"But that isnt a great comparison. 76ers are in the playoffs because of a great coach, fantastic role players, and Joel Embiid is playing crazy good. Ben Simmons doesnt have a jumper and cant make free throws. He hasnt contributed anything to the 76ers making the playoffs."
"Ben Simmons invited his old friend Joel Embiid for dinner at his brick house. That night in the suburbs, JE even choked on a vegan burger for the first time. ""I could fuck with this,"" he said. A super-2nd-round-exit was starting to be formed, over a side of Shirley Temples and...clink."
Reactionary takes are crazy right now. It's easier to look good against Ben Simmons and injured Joel Embiid then against Kevin Durant. The Bucks aren't perfect but we would not lose to the Hawks
"&gt;but i believe that if Ben had the opportunity (i think Houston would have been perfect) to have a team built around him, rather than Joel Embiid, i think we could see him become a 22/12/12 player and a top 5 PG in the league.  Nice try Morey!"
"Yeah exactly, if Joel Embiid is a poor fit next to Ben than so is like 90% of centers in the league, Embiid can shoot the three and attack close outs, plus he commands so much attention.  He provides more practical spacing than most centers."
"Joel Embiid - ""I am the greatest choke artist of all time""      Giannis Antetokounmpo - ""Hold my gyro"""
"Do you remember when the Sixers had Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler on their roster?  And they let Jimmy Buckets walk ...  I remember posting at the time that they should keep Jimmy and let Simmons go, and I got roasted for saying that.  Wonder how many Sixer fans would take a do over on that one."
"Joel Embiid is averaging **32/13 with 2.2 blocks** on an injured meniscus   He’s leading **both teams** in points, rebounds, and blocks   He’s shooting 83% from the Free Throw line which is 2nd best on his team and best among starters  Those 2 missed free throws don’t change what he’s doing"
Turns out that Joel Embiid and Seth Curry can't win a playoff series by themselves.
"KAT is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent. Nikola Jokic is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent. Joel Embiid is the perfect big for this generation of bbal, I would call him a generational talent."
Ben Simmons has a superstar teammate named Joel Embiid.  This is an acceptable exception.
"In the 1st round the Sixers announced that Joel Embiid has a small, lateral meniscus tear in his right knee. Hard to believe when he is jumping , running , diving , and falling all over the place. NBA is looking like the WWE."
"What a garbage article. ""Won't somebody think of the players, who agreed to do this in exchange for exorbitant sums of money!""   &gt;This could be Joel Embiid’s NBA, if only somebody would fix it.  The 76ers last game last season was on August 23. He had *four months* between their last game and their first game. **AFTER** having **five months** off before that.   Talking about how much time the Lakers had off does not tell me about the 76ers.  Joel Embiid played in a whopping 12 games between February 26 and December 23. (One of them, he played 5 minutes. Another, he played 13.)  He then, after all of 30 games (in which he took games off), he missed another month with injury.   Joel Embiid isn't the face of the NBA because Joel Embiid cannot stay healthy for more than a few weeks at a time."
"I feel like I’ve seen this said about everybody. Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Giannis. Let’s slow our rolls."
"Talking about one of the biggest losses in franchise history last night. And I can't really blame Embiid. Nobody should. Seth and Joel are alone on an island for last night's game. Of course he missed two free throws that were in crunch time, but $70 million for Tobias and Ben and they had zero second half field goals. Cut the criticism up as much as you want, Deal it out to whoever needs it, but if Ben, Tobias, and Doc aren't getting 90% of it, you're wrong."
I watch the game. I watch Embiid play like a bitch and whine everytime he doesn’t get a foul call and drives into people and gets soft ass calls all game. There is a reason he leads the league in FTs. He’s a flopping whiny bitch and gets more calls than anyone. Trae Young can’t even sniff his jock when it comes to FT attempts.   Joel Floppy boi Embiid
"Well, Shaq had Penny &amp; Kobe, while Joel has [checks notes]... a guard that doesn't shoot more than 3 ft from the rim and can't make freethrows.  So, it's not really a one-to-one comparison, and putting on the back of Joel alone is utterly idiotic.  You give Embiid prime Kobe and he wins a chip too."
LOSE IN SIX-ERS  https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/joel-embiid-crying.jpg
"I think you can argue that a Ben Simmons Joel Embiid offense just doesn’t work. Ben wants to run, and Joel being a big guy can’t do that for 48 minutes. I think Ben is better than he’s playing, but I’m not sure he’ll ever reach that level in this offense."
"Joel Embiid has a meniscus tear. While he’s still playing, that’s gotta be a contributing factor to why he went 0-12 in the second half of game 4 and something that the Sixers have to consistently monitor."
AD gets injured - Anthony day to Davis  Embiid gets injured - prayers up for Joel 🙏🙏
"Lol, I kept yelling at the TV. The sixers ran the same play for the entire second half - Ben dribble to the 3pt line, Embiid picks for Curry, Ben passes to Seth and then runs to the opposite side of the court that Seth goes to and hangs out near the baseline, Embiid takes top of the key as an outlet for Seth, Seth dribbles in and misses or passes to Joel who focuses too hard on getting the foul to have a few seconds of rest for his injured knees and huge balls whilst Tobi and Ben and &lt;INSERT 5TH BODY HERE&gt; give no assistance or threaten to score/cut to the hoop for a bucket, turnover to Atlanta.     It's as if Doc doesn't realize that any NBA team can see how to counter a play if you give them enough time to gameplan.   Package Ben for Dame or Steph or for that one guy begging on the corner by the Wawa near the Philly Convention Center. You know, whoever you can get. Harden on one leg was more effective than Ben's athleticism. Yeah he had some defensive plays, but they came when the sixers were in a drought offensively, so what do they fucking matter?"
" Giannis is a 0.5 inches shorter than embiid and is right under him in Ft attempted for 2021 what are you talking about lol… literally the second dude on the list is a 7 footer. And Treys 3rd right behind them both. And the NBA isn’t actively looking at Joel and Giannis’s fouls trying to make rule changes, but Trey and Hardens. Interesting 🤔"
"Then embiid should be sitting. If Joel Embiid is so injured he cannot stand, and cannot stop himself from ""falling"" (dangerously diving) into opponents knees he shouldnt be on the floor."
Embiid has the best flops. Flip flop bunny hop Joel Embiid.

- *Joel Embiid when asked about Ben Simmons’ Game 5 performance*
"This is probably the end of Ben and Joel right? Losing to the Hawks when you're the number one seed is probably the final nail in the coffin.   They could turn it around of course. But unless they manage to win it all, I get the feeling that no one really wants to see another Simmons and Embiid playoff run."
How much longer will it take for Sixers fans and even NBA fans in general to admit Simmons is just not that guy? No amount of defense and athleticism can hide the fact that this dude is not a centerpiece player and is holding Embiid back. His contract looks even more ludicrous by the minute.   Dude hasn't averaged more than 8 AST or 17 PTS in a season in his entire career.  Joel needs help. Simmons does not and will not be that guy for him.
"I remember reading a thread a while back about meeting players, and this one guy said he ran into Embiid somewhere. Said something to the effect of, ""I don't like the Sixers but you're awesome,"" and Joel said, ""your team probably sucks.""  Hey Joel. Your team sucks."
[Already taken my dude](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/John-Collins-shirt-dunk-Joel-Embiid-Hawks-76ers.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=704)
"Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons:  &gt;I mean I sat there &amp; watched him shoot for 20 minutes, and it didn't touch the rim a lot, I can tell you that."
Joel Embiid
"Joel Embiid, what have you got yourself into?"
The mavs spacing is such a beauty very underrated reason as to why their offense is so good is because everyone around Luka can shoot those layups where the definition of free for 3 reasons. Imagine how easy of a life Joel embiid would have if he had that spacing. *cough cough* Ben Simmons.   1.) Luka is far to big to be guarded by pat bev.   2.) no one wants to leave anyone because they all are snipers.   3.) clippers running small ball and have no real five in to be fair.
Marc Gasol + Joel Embiid playing too?
"Tim Duncan? Joel Embiid was pretty spot on, if memory serves."
"Worse is kind of an understatement. That’s like saying I’m a worse basketball player than Joel Embiid or Shaq. It’s technically true, sure. But it obscures the degree of just how much worse I am."
"Lol, so you say the torn meniscus didn’t affect him much because he was dropping 30/13/4 for the series, but then get on him because he had maybe one bad half. Well, maybe he felt it during that one half dude? Geez luiz.  You mention that his underperforming sometimes, gets overshadowed by Ben Simmons’ play? Maybe because Ben Simmons’ defender can park himself on the scansion and still play effective defense? It’s like playing 4 on 5 out there and you want to blame Embiid???   Simmons averaged less than 10 points a game as his team’s second best player and someone who has the ball in their hands every possession. If a defender ever guards Ben Simmons up past the foul point line, they’d be totally stupid to do so. Ben Simmons averages (and this is a real stat) only a little more than one shot further than 8 feet per game. Maybe it’s all those defenders crowding the low post that affects Embiid, who still averaged 30/14/4. What are you on?  Maybe that torn meniscus hurt for one half? I’ve torn my meniscus a few times. It sucks and you lose a lot of athleticism even if you can still move around.   Are you Ben Simmons or his agent? Is this Daryl Morey? Am I on Candid Camera? Is this real life right now?   Getting on Joel Embiid. You should be ashamed and your television watching rights should be removed lol."
"Lost in all of the Ben talk is how insane Joel was playing in the playoffs for a big man, even with the injury. By far the biggest factor the sixers lost was the injury finally slowing him down in the second half of the hawks series:   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nobody-told-joel-embiid-that-centers-dont-dominate-the-nba-anymore/"
*Joel Embiid faces huge Twitter backlash after launching baffling murder threat towards rival*
KAT is just as good as Nikola Jokic or Joel Embiid.
I'm pretty sure Joel Embiid just went agentless on his latest contract
"I think the top 3 is Nets, Bucks and Philly. Despite the disaster last season, Philly were great defensively. And if Joel Embiid plays like an MVP again, and Ben Simmons becomes a DPOY, thybulle keeping his defense,  they are a force to be reckoned with.  Although their chemistry might take a hit."
No Joel Embiid reps himself.
"Lamelo Ball, Joel Embiid, and Donovan Mitchell. Also like watching Zion play, but idk that I’d call him one of my favs"
"Because no one talks about anything other than ""Ben no dunk ball."" Doc costs us Game 1 by putting DG on Trae and taking far too long to adjust and put Ben in. Joel Embiid looked like he was gonna drop 60 in the first half of this game and then absolutely faded in the second half. We know he had a meniscus tear but it still cost us. Especially since he took a lot of iso shots in the second half of the game, this was one of the only ones that was actually setup. DG got hurt, which means we either had to choose defense (Thybulle) or shooting (Curry) when Curry was in G7 he got hunted all game long.   There are many factors as to why we lost including Ben. But some Sixers fans are convinced that if we just cut Ben we'd be the 96 Bulls."
"we talk about Nerlens Noel? Nerlens Noel? not Joel Embiid, not Bam Adebayo, Nerlens Noel."
So what's that unhinged rambling mess have to do with Joel Embiid flopping? Lol
Dude you can't say they 100% win game 3. The Hawks were only up 3 and it wasn't even the 4th quarter lol. That's hardly a safe lead   They then lost to the bucks without Giannis too. Acting like he didn't hyperextend his knee the next game.  Besides it's not like they'd have had a shot if the bucks hadn't taken out the nets either.  We also gonna ignore Joel Embiid playing with a meniscus tear?
"I've always thought Cleveland intentionally didn't grab a MCW, Oladipo, Zeller (some of the other top guys from that class) becuse they wanted to rebuild for another year and get a top player from the next class.   Such as Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Zach Lavine, Julius Randle, Aaron Gordon, Marcus Smart, Dante Exum etc.   I said it back then that the Cavs were trying to play a long game and have LeBron come back and try to coach up Kyrie and one of those guys since many of them are ""LeBron-Type"" players (Wing-fowards who can handle play post and guard multiple positions.)  They just so happened to get Bron back the next year and they drafted Andrew Wiggins, however they traded him away for Love almost immediately. But for a brief moment l felt like l was correct."
MVP: Joel Embiid.  All NBA: Curry - Doncic - Durant - Antetokounmpo - Embiid.  MIP: Mo Bamba.
"joel ""troel"" ""do a 180"" embiid"
You’re correct. He was the  number 1 but there were rumblings of Jabari and Embiid sneaking in there at the time. Plenty of mocks had Joel going number 1 even with the injury
"KAT is a great guy and a great player. I don't know why these past years he gained this fake reputation of being soft, the dude LITERALLY PUNCHED JOEL EMBIID (he also posterized his ass). He's improving on defense more and more every year, he's gonna be a superstar if our team turns out to be good this year"
"Not a single quote from Joel or Doc. Did you even read this? Did you even read the *headline* where it says rumors?   Joel Embiid has not spoken about anything publicly except his extension. Doc Rivers had not said he has not been able to reach Ben Simmons.   Are you three years old and don't understand what ""Embiid said"" means? Are are you an adult, but a dumbass?  You sent an article with one dude being quoted some guy named Joe Dumas, neither Embiid nor Doc is quoted AT ALL IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING ARTICLE.   Please tell me you are not this stupid."
"Average is bad because it skews the line but there are 10 (47.6%) that are 5.3WS or higher. Wiggins being the dotted line makes him 15th out of 21.  Is Wall a bust? Is D-Rose?  2000 Kenyon Martin wasn't a bust because even though he is a below average 1st overall pick.. go look at that draft class. it's a big roster of WHO??   Also for bust, many other factors have to be in discussion.   How bad was the pick compared to other people that team could have taken. Is Hakeem a bust compared to the Jordan they could have taken?  Also are we factoring injuries into discussing busts (Oden, Bias, D-Rose)?   Is Andrew Wiggins a bust.. I would say yes but it's close. joel embiid was taken 3rd that year and Wiggins / Embiid played for Kansas that year for only 1 year and while Wiggins had 20 points per 40 minutes.. embiid had 20 points and 14 rebounds per 40 minutes with a much better defensive rating than Wiggins.   Obviously we have seen Jokic from that same draft breakout to be a star and last year's MVP but that's an anomaly of having a pick that low turning out being a star/MVP. But.. anyone seeing tape of Wiggins in Kansas should have seen Embiid and pick Embiid over Wiggins.   (Edit: All the people above Wiggins have at least 1 season of 5.0 or greater WS)   So yes, Andrew Wiggins is the bust line."
"Of the draft lottery picks only 3 have become All-Stars - 2 for the first time last season.  1. Andrew Wiggins   2. Jabari Parker   3. Joel Embiid   4. Aaron Gordon   5. Dante Exum   6. Marcus Smart   7. Julius Randle   8. Nik Stauskas   9. Noah Vonleh   10. Elfrid Payton   11. Doug McDermott   12. Dario Šarić   13. Zach LaVine   14. T. J. Warren  Of that lottery draft class who do you put above him? Obviously Embiid, LaVine, and Randle but thats pretty much it. Maybe a case could be made for Marcus Smart ... realistically I can't be consider him a bust if he is the 4th most successful player in the lottery."
"Joel ""~~Do a 180~~ The Process"" Embiid"
"""Yeah.. but Joel Embiid isn't a dominant center"""
"right and your biggest point is that al horford isn't big enough to guard vucevic, even though horford has proven to be elite at guarding joel embiid.  i understand you're either 15 years old or just a troll so i'm just gonna stop engaging.  but that is some real mental gymnastics you gotta do.  you can just say ""Fuck the Celtics,"" people will love it."
isn't al horford one of the best players in the league at guarding joel embiid lol how much bigger do you need to be if you're already good at guarding the biggest scorer in the league?  and the celtics are big on the wing compared to most teams.  i think you're living in the kemba/IT era of the Celtics.  I'm not saying the Celtics are way better than the Bulls or that Vucevic isn't a good player that can give them problems.  but if the Celtics are a midget squad then like 90% of the NBA has midget squads.
[Number 23 in this clip](https://youtube.com/shorts/wadI6uJjMD4?feature=share) is Joel Embiid (at I think 15 years old) lmao
"I feel like I have to keep saying this, but Joel embiid was playing on a torn meniscus."
"I think he's getting downvoted for saying:  ""Joel Embiid isn't a good enough shooter to warrant praise lol."""
Joel Embiid is a human turnover
Needs to get on the Joel Embiid diet x2
Yes you're L. You are a fan of a team that made your reddit name after members of that team from different Eras. Enjoy getting dicked down by Joel Embiid and Giannis
"You're really doubling down on this, huh. Now, you've got to argue one point here. We're talking about draft day photos, not what these dudes have become, after they've hit the gym and grown and hired a permanent stylist. Kevin Love coming into the league looked like a fat nerd. Porzingus definitely looked like a giraffe had wandered into a suit store. Dwyane Wade is literally in the photo above wearing enough fabric for three suits. Lebron showed up in a zoot suit to his draft, looking like he had a wedding after, he even wore gaiters. Dame is only 6' 2"", and didn't have the same problems as the rest of these guy, neither did Rubio. Joel Embiid looked like a fifty year old accountant on draft day, and suffered none of the problems of looking too tall and too thin, because he was neither.   Now, if you want to talk about these dudes now. Sure, they're all selling clothes. And everything is fit for them to look right. Sometimes Lebron wears shorts and fake glasses, but sure right, whatever."
And I believe every word of it. Brett Brown is a solid dude.   Paul is a dick who rode LBJ’s coattails and can only get teams to sign people for max contracts that they already would give them anyway.   Joel Embiid did it right. Fuck agents and give back to the community with the money you save. Holla!
"bring back Joel ""Do A 180"" Embiid"
"In the postseason, nobody gives a shit if low volume shooters take shots. Shooters far better than Joel Embiid get sagged off of heavily or ignored."
"Joel Embiid isn't a good enough shooter to warrant praise lol. Low volume, mid-to-high percentage shooters are the most overrated ""commodity"" in the NBA. Nobody cares if Embiid shoots threes."
Joel Embiid negotiated his own contract and got a super max. How hard was it to negotiate lebrons contract lol
"His Twitter handle is literally ""Joel ""Troel"" Embiid"""
"Joel Embiid just negotiated a 4 year max contract extension for himself without an agent's help. Getting a superstar paid is not some accomplishment. Teams are desperate to sign stars and will pay any amount of money to do so. If you want to argue the case that Klutch is some great agency, getting role players paid is far more impressive. Any idiot could convince the Lakers to give Lebron max money."
The 76ers have Joel Embiid they weren’t offering him anything of value. And I can’t name a single other client that has had problems with rich Paul.
Luka Doncic  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Jokic  Zion Williamson  Trae Young  NEXT 5:  Jayson Tatum  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid  Kevin Durant  James Harden
Gonna do Current only  PG - Steph Curry  SG - Donte Divincenzo  F - Mikal Bridges   F - Luka Doncic  C - Joel Embiid
He wouldn't have Joel Embiid in Sacramento.
I saw his best game too. We were tanking big time and so I was excited at the shot of Wiggins. Kansas came to WVU and Wiggins dropped 40 on us. Then when the lottery happened and we got 3 I was distraught but then we drafted some other dude who was on that team named Joel Embiid
Dude’s got a longer wingspan than Joel Embiid. This is a lazy take.
He was a ‘lock’ because Embiid got injured lmfao. If Joel played 2 extra weeks he would have won
Joel Embiid
"Warriors: I have no idea what Klay will look like. I think they could fall anywhere between 2nd-6th seed.  Nets: How good can they be if everyone is actually healthy? It’s a big if considering how Harden looked in the playoffs, how often Irving is injured and how miraculously well Durant played coming off injuries.   Sixers: Joel Embiid has oft been injured and last year, he could have won MVP had he been healthy all year. Will they have Simmons? How’s that all going to work out after everybody on the team expressed their frustration with him, but they can’t trade him for more than peanuts?  Lakers: How many seasons does LeBron realistically have left? This reminds me of that Lakers team with Payton and Malone. They’re so old.  Pelicans and Wolves: I don’t know if either of these teams with their exciting young talent can actually play enough defense to win. I think Valenciunas will be huge for the Pels. That guy makes every team he’s on significantly better.  Heat: I think we will be a tough out, but our guard depth is not great. I feel like Herro is going to play a lot of point unless we make some other move.  Boston: I’m glad Horford is back with them. He is either utilized incredibly well or horribly. I’m glad he’s on a team who knows how to play him.  Pacers: They’re always good, but never great and absolutely never all healthy at once.  Kings: Davion Mitchell looked so great defensively in Summer League. I’m really hoping they can do something.  Hawks: I have no idea if they will continue with their playoff momentum or be a 6th-8th seed.   Some teams I think probably won’t be great:   Mavs seem the exact same. Idk why I would expect them to do anymore than get out of the first round at most. Kristaps knees seem to be forever plagued with “soreness”.   Wizards: They’ll need everyone to step up to make the playoffs with improved Bulls/Pacers/Celtics teams.  Raptors: I’m hoping somewhat selfishly as someone who went to FSU that Scottie Barnes is the truth. He kind of reminds me of Paul Pierce if Paul Pierce was a much less good shooter. Good court vision, solid defender, can handle a little bit and his game isn’t really dictated on athleticism, so if good, he could have a really long career."
It's a 58 games played requirment or 70% of games played last year Joel embiid played 71% of the possible games so he did technically qualify for league leaders
Maybe Joel Embiid he averaged 28.5 ppg last year
"Kawhi needs a more complementary team? Did you not see KD having to leave the thunder to go play with Steph Klay and Draymond??? Kawhi took Lowry and Siakam as his two best players to win a championship.  And for the defensive competition aspect, go take a look at 2019. Kawhi averaged 30.5 ppg on 49/38/88 shooting splits while going up against defenders such as: Aaron Gordon, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokuompo, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala.  I'll wait for you to let me know when KD has ever faced that many elite defenders in one playoff run.  Also, I remember when KD was going crazy vs the Pat Beverly Clippers, people didn't seem to care about how shitty the defenders he was playing."
"Not shooting, in fact, became an essential part of the Philadelphia program. In his upcoming memoir, The Young Socialite, Sixers guard Ben Simmons recalls a team-building exercise in which players were asked to recall the moments in a game during which they felt the highest. “When Ben’s turn came, we all assumed he was going to say that his highest moment was the day he made one 3 pointer against Orlando,” Embiid writes. “I mean, that was a personal record! But he didn’t. Instead he said, ‘My best moment was one night I caught a pass and I was like fifty centimeters from the basket and I was about to shoot it. And all of a sudden, I hear Joel being like, ‘What the fuck, Ben? You’re fifty centimeters out.’ And I thought about it for a second and passed it anyway. We lost the game, and I was like, ‘Yeah, Joel, fuck you.’ We all had a good laugh about that. I was like, ‘Wow, really dog? That was your best moment?'”"
No Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid threw him under the bus
"Yup.   If Embiid ever figures out his health problems, we're all in trouble.   Here's a fun comparison of career minutes played in the NBA.   * Andrew Wiggins - 18606 * Joel Embiid - 7943"
"Lebron   KD  Giannis  Steph  Harden  Kawhi  Luka Donic  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum   For 14/15 I could care less  I just think that you’re comment about him needing to be top 5 when healthy to be top 15 is complete bs, if I read it right.  If we’re considering Kyrie a PG and James an SG now I hold heartedly believe Kyrie is probably the best SG in the league (yes over Bradley Beal)  He had an absolutely amazing season this year, 9 in points per game, 11th in PER, and is the 9th player to make the 50/40/90 club, he also was having a good playoff run before he went down, and yes I do think Nets take the chip if Kyrie is healthy.  The Nets are a top heavy team that prides themselves on having 3 players who can go off at any moment and are borderline unstoppable when they do, I’ve seen you say it’s best they trade Kyrie, and no offense, that’s BS too.  There aren’t 15 players in the nba better than Kyrie"
The 76ers are the first seed they should beat a fifth seed when there is a game 7 in your court and Seth curry played amazing. Joel embiid if he’s a superstar should find a way.
"&gt;What dumb logic is this? Smaller dudes are going to be more prone to injuries than the larger guys...  Tell that to Joel Embiid, Danilo Gallinari, and Chandler Parsons.. I'm not sure smaller has much to do with it. Maybe there's a study out there that will prove which it is"
"\-He is one of the best low post scorers in the league, he is aggressive and his efficiency down their is similar to Joel Embiid.  Has been a + defender for a while now, he is criminally underrated."
"Name names or else these guys will get of the hook. Josh Harris is the managing partner for the 76ers with a net worth of 5 Billion. The Embiid contract is small potatoes, he’d need 25 $200 million contracts, this has nothing to do with Joel but has everything to do w Josh Harris and his partners. Didn’t one of them give Robert Kraft a Bentley for his birthday? I mean if they are claiming they can’t afford this equipment managers salary they should sell the team to someone who isn’t pure evil."
So is Joel Embiid gonna pull double duty as a player AND equipment Mgr?  Seems like a logical solution.
"At least he can tell his friends ""Joel Embiid got me fired"" although that's not much of a consolation prize."
Joel Embiid
"I’m sorry but when Joel “Mountain Dew Memes” Embiid is the pillar of maturity for your organization, you got some fuckin problems guy"
"There is literal evidence that proves Embiid is talking out of his ass. Jimmy voiced the reasons why he left in both a podcast with JJ Redick and in a SI interview. None of it involved Simmons. Also, the entire basketball world knows the reason they got Horford is because Al owned Embiid in the playoffs and taking him out of the equation was seen as a big positive, and he was seen as a good insurance policy for the oft injured Embiid, not only if Joel got injured but to also allow him to rest more. Again, it had nothing to do with Simmons."
Embiid needs to go to a championship caliber team. This dude has been truly professional about this 76ers drama. Free Joel.
"The ""Embiid and Doc threw Ben under the bus is BS."" Ben is an adult who refuses to accept responsibility. Ben cant handle the smallest amount of criticism. Joel and Doc spoke truths. Can you win with a POINT GUARD who refuses to shoot outside of 3 feet?"
"It was intense and at one point, Joel Embiid was crying but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned."
"Joel ""Troel"" Embiid"
"Even joel embiid was surprised by how hard he bit. Is there a subreddit or ig for joel embiid pump fakes? From our perspective they look so unbelievable, and yet people bite so damn hard."
"Joel Embiid: “hey Ben I’m glad there’s no hard feelings,  u ready to put those shooting videos on display for Wells Fargo arena?”  Ben: “tough crowd in there mate”"
"Morey: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?  Simmons: When?  Morey: Friday.  Simmons: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You took that seriously?  Morey: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?  Simmons: Come on. Will you stop it.  Morey: No brains? No ability?  Simmons: Teasing.  Morey: Okay. I want you outta here.  Simmons: I don't know where you're getting this from. I... You're serious aren't you? Oh, [laughing] you see? You just don't know my sense of humor. I mean, Joel, don't I joke around all the time?  Embiid: I wouldn't say all the time.  Morey: You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."
Raptors gave him a “welcome to the NBA” night.   Take it from Joel Embiid. “They’ll gonna double... triple team you!”   Raptors are going to scheme against the best player and force the others to beat them.
"Joe Lacob, 2 days after the draft:   &gt; To be honest with you, he was my No. 1 forever, basically. I just think he’s a once-in-a-decade kind of guy. I would argue that, other than Embiid, I don’t know that there’s another center prospect that’s come along in the last decade that you would put in the same category. Different players, maybe. But this guy is immensely talented.  James Wiseman better be Joel Embiid 2.0"
Hot take.   Joel Embiid is very good at basketball
That’s coward shit to mock the media and fans all year that warned Doc you need to change some things with Ben. When you underperform as a team as the god damn 1 seed instead of backing your players you act indecisive.  That’s why numerous players have come out against Doc because all his rally talk BS wears thin and his politician spin on everything always backfires.  This man said the second round elimination was a god damn miracle run when they were favored and the one seed.  Joel going on Twitter to tell Philly fans to show love and do better then the fans made him double down and act scared after they punked him. Talking about not every player is mentally tough like wtf. You get the article that Simmons is believed to feel his pairing with Embiid has run its course and it’s not personal and yet Embiid comes out with a story that Butler left because of Ben when Jimmy said it was due to management
"Good take. Feel sorry for you guys in Philly who understand Ben isn't worth the same deal as Harden/AD. Have an awesome leader in Embiid and just need this carnage taken care of. If Morey had been realistic and made the trade at the draft/start of free agency, imagine the narative/coverage around the team right now.   Would be much more positive and moving forwards as a united team. Not having everyone asking Joel and Doc about Simmons every day for 5 min.    Definitely ready for this story to be over."
"Probably 3, once Joel Embiid finally gets out of his way."
I would love to see Joel Embiid do another awkward hug with his team mate but instead of Drummond it's Simmons this time
“Hahaha…hahahahahah..wait…hahahaha..hold on he’s doing what? Hahahahahah.” - Joel Embiid.
But but Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid were too mean though.
I think Embiid is the key here.   Philly fans will likely be brutal but the one player I can see turning around the atmosphere is Joel. If he publicly embraces the return and challenges the fans to support I can see it not being a disaster. But if Ben still isn’t shooting wide open 3s and making &lt;50% FTs it’ll turn real quick.   Very unlikely but anything is possible.
Back pain from a Joel Embiid pile-driver.
"One of the knocks on Luka was that his 3 point shooting wasn't great, especially recently in the tournamet. In an era were 3 point shooting and defense is so valued in perimeter players it was enough to consider other players above him. Ayton and Bagley were 20/11 players with 65% TS which is spectacular as freshmen in college. This is better production than Joel Embiid, better than Shaq, better than KAT, better than Tim Duncan in terms of raw production as freshmen in college."
"&gt; ""I felt good,"" he said. ""The first game -- I felt pretty good. Playing against Toronto is always a challenge for me. Not necessarily a challenge, but these are the types of games where I'm really focused on passing the ball and inviting double teams, and kicking it out. This is not the type of team I'm going to go out and score 50 because they are going to double and triple-team on every single possession.""  &gt;In past years, Raptors head coach Nick Nurse has proven that he can draw up a defensive game plan to get under Joel Embiid's skin. So, heading into Thursday night's game, the big man joked with another teammate that he knew he wasn't going to score much in his first preseason game since it was against Toronto.  &gt;”My focus coming into tonight was, I told Tyrese (Maxey) I was gonna have zero points and ten assists,"" Embiid said. ""I was trying to get guys and figure out how to be a better passer. A few turnovers here and there, but we can always get better."""
"Joel Embiid, and not Charles Barkley, is responsible for coming up with AD's ""Street Clothes"" nickname."
"Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Rudy Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  I'd put him top 6 probably after those 5, but I don't see how that's *""at the absolute worst""*."
The only one that gets me scared for them is the sixers if Joel goes down at all and they have to rely on a Drummond who wants to prove he's better than Embiid. I think they'll be well seeded and get Damian Lillard with a Ben + Maxey + something + picks package tho so.  This year is so damn difficult because a lot of teams are actually good  Nets  Heat  Bucks  76ers  Hawks    ____  Jazz  Lakers  Suns  Mavs  Warriors
"I lean much more toward how much you dominated your era, with a large bias toward the 80s and later (I'm not so impressed with dominating a league that had 10 teams in it and the bench guys had to have part time jobs in the offseason).   If you heavily weight to how skilled the players are, then the older guys like Oscar Robertson or Bill Rustle really don't stand a chance. How could you compare Bill Rustle's skill level to, for example, Joel Embiid? Obviously Rustle is an all time great and Embiid is not. But equally obviously Embiid is vastly more skilled (at least on the offensive end).  Today's players are more skilled. The training is just much better. The coaches and players have all learned from the prior generations, so we give those prior generations respect. But we can't deny that game has evolved.   I think the killer mentality is important as well. But that goes back a bit to dominating the league. And it puts the great defensive players at a pretty big disadvantage, unless you are think of that killer mentality as the willingness to take on the top defensive assignments."
"It’s a stretch but the opposite of ben Simmons is Joel embiid -one is a PG who can’t shoot, the other is a center who can knock down 3s -one is a baby, the other is a dick -one is an outside defender, the other is an inside defender -one loves and is loved by philly, the other is enemy number one"
"They are absolutely *not* a top three team as currently constructed....Embiid will inevitably sustain an injury or three and miss a bunch of games. Tobias isn't leading that team to a whole lot of wins in his absence. Joel averages 60 games played per full season, those 22 games without him are going to be ugly. Also take into account the fact Embiid is just 10-15 when Simmons doesn't play. You all very much underestimate the impact Simmons has on your *regular* season record..."
"The Sixers are wasting a season of Joel Embiid. This team is going nowhere without Simmons.   They are a bunch of fools, a team led by amateurs. This is Kings/Knicks level of incompetence."
"Wiggins and Simmons.   Both #1 overall picks, both lauded as the next guy up (though neither made an impact in the NCAA tourney in their 1-and-done seasons), both won rookie of the year and showed promise but couldn't become ""the guy"". then both got signed to a max contract by their first team, but both failed to develop their games (and both because of temperament, albeit in different ways), so (soon to be) both needed a fresh start on a new squad to settle in to becoming the solid starter that they were always meant to be.   bonus: both played with joel embiid but failed to mesh and the team underperformed as a result. oh, and both foreign players from english speaking countries...which is neat."
"Sixers.  Embiid is under contract for this year and the next. If the Sixers fuck this up Joel will leave.  If Embiid leaves then Simmons will then have a shit ton of leverage  People are underestimating the impact of shitty team management, just ask the Wolves and Kings"
"Disagree. Idc what anyone else says, to me Embiid IS the process, or at least the culmination of it. I’m not saying Hinkie was some savant but nothing after 2015-16 was him and he was pushed out that season so we don’t know what direction he would’ve gone with prospects like Jah… Joel always used to talk about his connection with Hinkie and how he sees himSELF as “The Process”. Everything after 2015-16 I consider post-processing, if you will, which has been so-so."
"Yep I love it. All the Big men are straight up haters.   Joel hates Drummond, KAT, Gobert, john Collins  Gobert hates Jokic, Embiid, KAT  Jokic hates KAT, DAJ, Taj Gibson, Gobert"
"&gt;Joel Embiid holds back, and he could be much better than he is. Knowing that he’s got bones of glass and skin of paper, he plays reserved hoping not to get injured (even though he still does). If he were healthier he’d be this generations Shaq  I wish this was true, but...nothing bothers me more than Embiid going after lose balls and flailing / falling down, mostly on defense. Several of his injuries can be directly tied to this. I wish to God he'd just let it go on defense once in a while if it means not risking another knee or back injury."
"@wojespn: “Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Joel Embiid have signed with the Seattle Sonics, with Kyle Lowry likely to join on the veteran minimum.”"
"Don’t think that’s a good comparison bc Curry is only better at shooting. CP3 is better in all the “traditional pg” skills.  Gobert is better on defense than Embiid, but Embiid is better at literally everything else including “traditional big” stuff like post moves. Only reason op doesn’t include Joel is bc he can shoot.   Take away Joel’s outside shot, he’s the best “traditional big”. Take away Curry’s shooting, CP3 is still the best “true pg”"
I mean the only way so far to beat the Nets is for someone to score 50. I think if there is one person who can score 50 4 times in a series against the Nets it would be Joel Embiid lol
"I did, and he's a great defender, but Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid both dropped 40 with him as their primary defender so forgive me if I don't believe he's some impenetrable tower. Tonight the Clips have also done well against him"
[The Raptors as a team.](https://raptorsrapture.com/2021/04/16/toronto-raptors-solid-defense-joel-embiid/) I don't know about a specific player. Maybe Gobert?
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Because Giannis is his teams main and most dominant paint presence. Him shooting a lot of jumpers only serves to hurt him and his team because he should be attacking more.   Ben Simmons has to share the floor with Embiid, and his refusal to shoot jumpers/space the floor, makes the game a lot harder for Joel, who when healthy is playing like the most dominant big inside since prime Dwight."
not the Joel Embiid flair commenting 💀
there's a middle ground that Simmons needs to get to. I think Giannis takes too many but Simmons needs to get to the point where he's at least a slight threat to knock down a jump shot  Also Giannis doesn't share the floor with Joel Embiid
"It was completely down to Gobert and Embiid (Davis finished 3rd with his team 14th in defense compared to 1st and 3rd for Rudy and Joel, respectively) and the difference in their playing time was 96 minutes across 7 games, which isn't a particularly large gap. In comparison, the gap between Jokic and Embiid this year was 903 minutes across 21 games. If Embiid had missed fewer games, making the playing time gap between he and Gobert larger, he would've won."
He did it already in game 1. He shot like 8/11 and Blake clearly couldn’t handle him. He’s not exactly Joel Embiid but he is still a very good post player and finisher around the rim.  Then we decided it was actually better to have him spotting up all the time because what the fuck is a gameplan.
"I can't fathom trying to score on anyone with NBA level defense.   Imagine being guarded by Ben Simmons, and you somehow get past him only to be met by Joel Embiid LOL"
"Hakeem was like the perfect combo of present day Embiid and Unversity of Kansas Embiid. Joel is more skilled now, but dude's agility was on a different level when he was much slimmer."
"Well, as biased you are, so will I be in a way. But bias is nothing to frown upon or to discredit, it's also a show of preference right?  First reason - Availability. Both guys were drafted in 2014. Since then, Embiid missed almost 300 games, compared to played in 260. Jokic played every game this year, and with short offseason they had, it's really outsanding feature.  Other thing that basically limits the availability is injury proneness. Knock on wood, Jokic is way more durable than JoJo, and I hope Joel stays injury free from this part of his career, if I am being totally honest. But it is as it is right now, and Jokic has that on his side.   Passing - Easy take, no need for further explanation.  Scoring - Jokic is just as effective as Joel is, and scored 2 less points with averaging significantly less FTA. That can be explained that Jokic doesn't go as much to the paint as Joel, but one factor more is that Jokic wasn't always getting the whistle in his favor. He did in Portland series, which got me really surprised, but 1st game against Suns he once again had 0 FTA. With that on the side, Jokic makes 8.4 assists per game, which is #6th best average in the league.  Defense - Without a doubt this is Joel's category. But not by a long shot these analysts try to present it as. Jokic isn't the monster blocker, but can have a game with 5 blocks in a most random way ever. Jokic averages 0.7/0.8 blocks per game and for a guy who is 7"" it's not the best average, but Embiid averaged 1.4, which is way less than other defensive centers were doing. Jokic also adds 1.3 steal per game, and it's a defensive category, compared to Joels 1. They average just about the same rebounds. ***However*** going in the paint and seeing Embiid is way scarier than seing Jokic. But it's not like Jokic can't block.  Jokic is also at top of his game all season long, 15 TD's and 60 double doubles. It's wild.  As for the performance in the playoffs, Jokic had a better first round, without a doubt. Not the best, but better. And he basically carried Denver against the Portland, who despite what people like Perkins are saying, are a decent defensive team when Nurkic is playing. As far for the Suns series, it's gotten to the point where his playing for 6/7 months straight is taking it's toll. And let's be honest, Ayton is one tough motherfucker. He's way above over Capela, both defensive and offensive wise. No tough love for Clint tho and Hawks tho (can't hate them for Bogi reasons), but Suns are tougher cookie.   Both players are great, but I'd take a guy who I can rely on basically whole season and carry it in playoffs. Love Embiid tho, but love Jokic more. And I can't hate a guy whose [childhood hero was Jokic](https://youtu.be/LU62fJxgB3I). All jokes, nothing but love for a great sport that is Embiid. Im rooting for Atlanta now, for Bogi reasons again, but if you guys go through, im for you all the way"
"Well to be fair,   Their odds have increased since Joel Embiid got a partial meniscus tear in his knee, Lebron and AD both not being 100% for the playoffs.   That’s two of their biggest competitors that were impacted by injury. It knocked the Lakers out and the 76ers are still trucking but Embiid’s ability to play the entire playoffs at 100% is a big question mark.   Their biggest issue too was defence, as this would probably be the worst defensive team to win a ring in NBA history (if the Nets go on to win)."
https://www.gamblingsites.org/news/joel-embiid-190-passes-lebron-james-220-to-become-mvp-favorite/
you could make an argument for kawhi but there is no denying the greatness of joel embiid on both ends
"Joel Embiid is special player, because he is a threat from 3pt, mid range, and paint. He can protect the paint, and when he switch on guards he move his feet to contain guards. His movements as a 7ft center is exceptional for his size on both offense and defense. The problem is the movements he uses put pressure on his joints which cause few injuries."
"The title is facetious. It's closer to the the idea of the statement, ""Centers don't dominate the NBA anymore, but you wouldn't guess that just by watching Embiid""      The current title is stupid and does little to convey that.      This is the 3rd &amp; 4th sentence,   &gt;That Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, the winner of and runner-up for the 2021 MVP award, put up such commendable years has a meta meaning, at least to those tired of the sameness of contemporary basketball: The tyranny of the perimeter is over. The center is back."
Giannis is our Ben. Middleton is our Tobias. Gladly we have a Joel Embiid so they don’t have to be #1 and #2.
Currently: DeAaron Fox.  Current Non-King: Joel Embiid. All-Time: Hakeem.

should have given the mvp to joel embiid instead of nikola fraudic     if youre an mvp you cannot get swept in the playoffs regardless of round or context
"Give me Joel Embiid any day, any night, any month and on any planet. If I'm playing against Embiid the next day, I'm losing sleep. I'm not losing sleep over Jokic."
"&gt; 1999 Lakers? didn't even have 3 All-Stars  Shaq, Kobe, Glenn Rice. And you can't go with ""He doesn't count because he wasn't an all-star that year, even though he had been the three previous years"", since with Detroit you emphasized how that exact year wasn't as important as the years leading up to it.  &gt; 3 established stars acquired through trades/FA is a superteam.   Why are we suddenly pretending there's no difference between a star and a superstar?  Nick Vucevic, Julius Randle, and Paul George would not be a superteam.  Joel Embiid, Luka Doncic, and Damian Lillard would be."
"Defensive.  I can imagine myself hitting an open three if the team runs a play to get me open (I can't imagine myself getting a clean look one-on-one against an NBA player, though.)  I can't imagine myself keeping up with an NBA wing on defense, and I certainly can't see my 6'1"" ass doing a goddamn thing to bother Joel Embiid unless I jammed a finger in his ass when he posted me up, but that's only going to work once and I'd prefer not to eat through a straw."
"This is the game you're referring to..   @andyblarsen: Joel Embiid matchup data against Rudy Gobert last night:   8-18 FG, 1-4 3P, 5-7 FT, 22 points, 1 assist"

"Joel Embiid- Marc Gasol  In 2019 he averaged 27.5/13.6  Against the Raptors he averaged **17.6 points** and 7 rebounds   Not a superstar, but Vuc got shut down by Gasol too:  In 2019 he averaged 20/12  Against Gasol he averaged **11 points** and 8 rebounds"
"I mean it was taught by coaches and experts. Read for yourself.     ""At the team’s practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, just seconds before he vanishes from sight to take a post-workout shower, Embiid smiles when asked about his frequent falls. “It was something I learned during my rehab when I was going through the foot injury, when I was trying to find ways to limit the impact on my body in 2014,” he says. “I was told that every time I feel like I’m in a situation where it’s going to be some type of extreme [weight] on my leg, I’ve got to dive or just roll onto the floor. So that’s why I do it."" “I know there are fans that are always thinking, ‘No!’ each time I fall, but that’s why I do it,” Embiid says with a brief grin before heading for the showers. “The specialists for my foot told me to do it.”   It's not some random thing. https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/05/10/joel-embiid-falls-down-a-lot-because-his-doctors-told-him-to/"
"Just a little preview of what's going to happen to Joel Embiid, if he keeps playing on a torn meniscus."
"&gt;Lol, I go to the doctor every 6 weeks.  Anthony Davis?!?!  &gt;proudly 6 foot flat in socks.   Oh, never mind.  (No one make a Joel Embiid joke, please)"
"According to [NBA.com's resident medical expert](https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2021-expert-medical-analysis-on-philadelphia-76ers-centre-joel-embiids-meniscus-tear/13ioejwn342kj152dot1dpm19a), Embiid will almost certainly need more invasive treatment eventually for the meniscus. They're just trying to get him as far into the postseason as possible through therapy."
What are you talking about? Joel Embiid always drops on him.
Ooo that’s exciting. Get ready for a whole new Joel and Tobias compared to before. Embiid has an unstoppable midrange game now along with all of his other skills and Tobias is a killer in the paint
"It has probably been said before but Embiid is really good. I think it is a travesty he didn’t get more votes. Also his dominance vs the Hawks is ridiculous. The Hawks are probably a year or two away from being serious contenders. They have literally zero answers for Joel. And Trae hasn’t got anyone to take pressure off of him from the Sixers wing D. Gonna be interesting.  Anyway, it’s gonna be fun seeing how the Nuggets respond. The Suns really sparked some crazy runs in that game."
"I actually believe him. I think that with Embiid you have to take his statements on these awards as a caliber of play he expects from himself more than a campaign for the award.  If Embiid plays like an MVP or DPOY, he thinks that gives the 6ers the best chance to win, which is what he cares about. So when he says ""I think I'm the MVP"" it means he's playing up to his own expectations of himself.  Idk, I might be wrong but Joel has seemed like an unapologetic winner since Kansas. And winners care about winning more than anything else. So I try and take what he's saying through that lens."
"reminds me of the raptors vs 76ers in playoffs 2 years ago  Cool nugget from Raptors very international team. Serge Ibaka speaks french to Pascal Siakam, spanish to Marc Gasol &amp; english to the rest team. When Serge &amp; Gasol doubled Joel Embiid they would yell where to help from in Spanish so Joel (who speaks french) could not understand."
"Capela to Embiid: “Joel, You’re such a disease.”"
"Looking back at the 2014 Draft and 2014/2015 Rookie Class.  \#1 Draft Pick - Andrew Wiggins  Rookie of the Year - Andrew Wiggins  All Stars - Joel Embiid (2018-2021), Nikola Jokic (2019-2021), Zach LaVine (2021), Julius Randle (2021)  MVP - Nikola Jokic (2021)"
"So Embiid is too emotional, no doubt. However, Gallo was playin dirty with him. Joel absolutely has to be better, here, but it's not like he was incorrect in feeling that Gallo was playin fairly dirty."
"Embiid saying he doesn't care about awards isn't very convincing considering he was [saying the opposite](https://theathletic.com/news/sixers-joel-embiid-thinks-theres-no-doubt-hes-mvp-this-season/UUvh39YjITw8) a couple months ago:  &gt; Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid believes ""there’s no doubt"" he's the NBA's MVP this season, he told The Athletic's Shams Charania in a sitdown interview for Stadium. &gt;  &gt; ""I've been dominant all season,"" Embiid said. "" ... I do it on both sides, and also as a team. You look at the seeding, No. 1 in the East, and you look at that last two MVPs, which is Giannis, that's what he did, you know, offensively and defensively."" &gt;  &gt; The four-time All-Star admitted using last year as motivation for him heading into 2020-21, going as far as saying it ""really bothered me a lot"" when he didn't make an All-NBA team. It wasn't his best statistical year and Embiid received his fair share of criticism, including from fellow former big man and current NBA on TNT broadcaster Shaquille O'Neal. &gt;  &gt; ""I just decided basically that enough was enough,"" Embiid said. ""Last year, I felt like I was disrespected. Everybody kind of forgot who I was, so I just decided I needed to do better."""
"&gt; Call the insurance agency, alert the authorities, and check all the closets. Joel Embiid was robbed. There can be no further argument. &gt;  &gt; If the NBA had any integrity, it would revoke the voting privileges of the 100 ding-dongs who put someone other than Embiid at the top of their MVP ballots.  Clown town."
"Bro, that's like saying your two best players are Joel Embiid and Shake Milton. You know that's bullshit. Donovan, Rudy, Conley, Bojan are all starters and are amazing at what they do. Clarkson is an amazing player and the SMOTY, but come on man, you know you're talking bullshit."
"Joel Embiid in my opinion. Not the shooting ability necessarily but the athletic build, defense, ability to score in the low post"
"You guys don’t see him shove embiid quickly as he stands up?   Joel was just coming to check on him, too.  That’s why he gets so outraged all of a sudden."
Joel embiid and ayton are the only centers that matter
The correct answer is Joel Embiid
Joel Embiid. Not even close.
"Even more context is that only like 1-2 plays before that, on a Seth Curry made 3, Gallo straight yanked Embiid to the floor under the basket and nothing was called. So Joel was still probably upset about that play, and then also upset about getting called for an offensive foul, then Gallinari also threw the shoulder a bit.  I still think this should have been a single tech for Embiid, but the tension there was building for a bit and Gallinari probably should have had a tech (or some kinda foul) on the other play anyways."
"It’s fine you think that, but there’s a MASSIVE statistical gap between them for a reason. By the end of the season, Jokic ended up dominating Embiid in every single meaningful advanced stat, largely because he was better the whole time but also because Embiid wasn’t able to sustain his outlier midrange shooting in the second half, as expected. He simply isn’t as good- especially when you consider that his constant injuries are a function of his playstyle (that dramatically increases his injury risk vs Jokic), eg, both knee injuries this year came from reckless dunk attempts that had uncontrolled landings. If Joel scales that back like LeBron did (this year his injury was bad luck, which can happen to anyone), his rate numbers would go down, he wouldn’t pop out as much on the screen, but he’d ultimately be more valuable and would contribute to more wins. Embiid is awesome, he was pretty clearly the 2nd or 3rd best player on a per minute basis this year. But the gap between #2 and #1 is huge- Embiid couldn’t win with the supporting cast Jokic has right now (see: last season). Jokic is legitimately on track to be a top-20 all time player, Embiid really just isn’t there yet. He hasn’t even played 80% of a season once, and misses more than a 3rd on average. That’s a fundamental, extremely consistent part of who he is as a player and you can’t just brush it off like it’s a coincidence."
Gobert is arguably the best post defender in NBA history and can still only hope to slow Joel down. Embiid is a phenom.
"You're misinterpreting Doc's words. Ben is who he is this season, Doc's first with the team. Doc has heard of Ben and Joel and knows their strengths and weaknesses. He has made an offense that maximizes the strengths while minimizing the weaknesses. Doc is happy with how Ben is playing because he knows he can't put him in a hyperbaric time chamber and make him a shooter/scorer mid season. Luckily he has Embiid and then after him Harris.   He never said he doesn't want Ben to get better in the future, but he's coaching this team *right now.*"
"Embiid is great, but the narrative that he's on a different level from Giannis just isn't real, it's totally reactionary to the fact that the Bucks are getting spanked right now and Joel is playing great.    Unfortunately as good as both are, I'm not sure I see any team beating the Nets 4/7 times this year."
“Not from the Blazers..” -Joel Embiid
"Wow, what a valuable player. It's hard to imagine that any player is more valuable on both ends of the court than Joel Embiid. Definitely the type of player you'd select for your first team if you were picking teams from NBA players."

"Obviously hyperbole, but we both know the underlying truth there.   I like Trae, have defended his offensive game in the past, liked the trade to acquire him, etc. In fact, the Hawks were my second team while they were rebuilding, as I was fond of Lloyd Pierce and liked what Trae and John the Baptist brought to the table -- and the Hawks sub was generating some very Process-era memes and mentality while they were tanking, which is where my heart will always reside.  That all said, you cannot argue in good faith that his game doesn't rely on generating fouls. It does. He's built for the modern era. That's not an insult, but it is the truth. He would not be anywhere near the impactful player he is if whistles were silent and defense was played like it used to be. Jo also takes advantage of the way the rules are slanted in favor of shooters, but he's not reliant on it in the same way.  At least [read the third-party review of Jo's fouls](https://theathletic.com/2338267/2021/01/22/a-celtics-fans-guide-to-being-mad-about-joel-embiid-free-throw-machine/) if you're going to be upset about whistles during the series."
"Yeah, I specifically addressed that. See:  &gt;If calling it equally means both teams can play defense, the Hawks wouldn't stand a chance. If calling it equally means both teams are allowed to push off on their defenders and get the call for it, the Hawks wouldn't stand a chance.    See also:  &gt;The Hawks win when Trae can disguise initiation of contact with his small size and sell it as a foul, and the Hawks win when Doc is too stubborn to have any defensive gameplan that makes sense or logical rotations.  Trae needs the whistle to generate offense. Jo gets his regardless. The whistle is a bonus.  [Recommended reading from the Celtics' beat writer.](https://theathletic.com/2338267/2021/01/22/a-celtics-fans-guide-to-being-mad-about-joel-embiid-free-throw-machine/)"
"The bottom line is both teams have problems that are difficult to solve.   Atlanta has a problem called Trae Young. What can the Sixers do with him and his pick and rolls? Well they did a good job of not letting him get absolutely everything he wanted like the first half of last game. That's three half's in a row we contained him.   Philadelphia has a problem called Joel Embiid. What can the Hawks do to defend him? They have not come close to answering this question this far.  Nobody on this roster can stop him from getting easy looks shooting wherever he wants. And when you double him, the other players get open looks or he still draws a foul or shoots over it.   One sequence Capela got an alley-oop on him and Joel just went down the other end and simply *decided* to give him his third personal foul and send his pogo stick having ass to the bench."
"You cannot, simply *cannot* have watched that game (or really any Sixers game featuring Joel Embiid) and tell me Joel doesn't make his teammates better."
"I’m going to keep dying on my hill that I despise Joel Embiid lol. Dude is such a fucking diva, I cannot stand him. Great player, seriously one of my least favorite players personality wise."
"If you told me Joel Embiid was from Omicron Persei 8, I would believe you."
"To be fair, Dudley's a straight out clown goon.  Gallo can at least ball.    Gallo threw Embiid down on the play before and on this play when he got helped up, gave a shoulder to Embiid as he walked by.  Yes, Joel shouldn't have reacted like that,  but let's not act like Gallo didn't know what he was doing by being chippy with Embiid.   Embiid has to be smarter because the Hawks are going to try and bait him because they cannot guard him at all."
That why tobias Harris is averaging all star numbers and with Danny Green leading the league in corner 3s and seth curry having a great offensive year yeah?  Nevermind embiid scoring at a unve rate and constantly getting their centers in foul trouble  I've never in my life seen joel played off the floor  I've seen it happen to jokic in the playoffs
"Dont let the post game stats fool you - Joel Embiid had more free throws than the hawks after 3 quarters.  Also, the fuck is philly thinking giving Embiid so many minutes on a torn meniscus 2 games in 3 days? Do they really think it wont get worse? Why gamble the career of the most injury prone player in the league like this"
Fuck you Joel Embiid

Ben Simmons woke up and said Joel Embiid holding me back.. my guy Joel is holding you back from being in China
"You know who lead the league in points per 100 possessions this season? Joel Embiid at 44.1, just ahead of Curry at 44.0 and Beal at 40.3. He did it at 64% TS, taking 3 threes a game at 38%."
"I mean, you can not buy this as a valid reason to request out, but it’s pretty damn clear they’re not a great fit.   You can cite 3-point numbers all you want, but Embiid is not really a “shooter.”  He takes like 3 per game. While teams do close out on him, they’re not panicking because he has a few feet of space. More importantly, he’s the most dominant post player in the league. He averaged nearly 15 two-point shots (and over 10 free throw attempts) per game last year despite playing 31 minutes. That’s essentially him taking a shot inside the arc every 90 seconds he’s on the court. Dude takes up space inside the paint and that’s where he’s at his best. Because Simmons’ can’t shoot, he needs to have a more open paint to attack, something that’s pretty damn hard to have with Embiid on your team.   Again, not saying that Simmons is justified in asking out, but there are tons of pairings that make more sense with Simmons than Joel."
Give it 12 hours and we’ll see a “Ben Simmons will not play for Philadelphia even if Joel Embiid is traded” tweet just cause that’s how annoying these headlines are getting
I agree with most of that assessment. The problem is that when Ben is on the court with shooters the last two seasons and Joel on the bench he rarely plays any different. Every now and then he takes over a quarter and then he does nothing the rest of the game with the same lineups. Once in a while he has a tremendous game but he can absolutely do most of what he does when he has great games with Embiid on the floor but he just won't.
Joel Embiid was disappointed…
Lol he can't be serious. Joel Embiid is hampering and impeding Ben Simmons? GTFOH

"Who the fuck is telling Ben Simmons that Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid do not play well together? The dumbasses at ESPN? If you look at the stats, the Sixers are only good when both Joel and Ben are on the court together. Ben’s an idiot if he’s believing people who say him and Joel don’t work together.   It’s your fault for not improving as a player, Ben, not Joel’s."
JOEL EMBIID IS HOLDING BEN SIMMONS BACK
"*In a Starscream voice*  **JOEL EMBIID HAS FALLEN.  I, SIMMONS, AM NOW LEADER OF THE DECEPTI-SIXERS**"
  My team:  James Harden Michael Jordan LeBron James Kevin Garnett Joel Embiid  A bit of an explanation is needed here.   Harden would be mainly a distributor role while shooting stepback 3s and drawing fouls as needed. Jordan and LeBron are self-explanatory I think. Garnett mainly for defense and passing and tenacity. Embiid for tenacity and dominant interior defense and scoring.   I admittedly am a fan of Harden and Embiid but I also wanted to give the lineup a modern twist from the usual suspected names.

He lost Game 4 basically by himself, and the hack-a-Simmons worked better than on any player I've ever seen, and I saw the original hack-a-Shaq.  [https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/ben-simmons-free-throw-76ers-wizards/2xrcqf20wbfk1stsg9qwouo1t](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/ben-simmons-free-throw-76ers-wizards/2xrcqf20wbfk1stsg9qwouo1t)     ""*The 76ers' chances at sweeping the Wizards disappeared with every Ben Simmons free throw on Monday.*      *Philadelphia, looking to sweep the Wizards and move onto the second round of the NBA playoffs, saw that opportunity diminish after Joel Embiid left the game in the first quarter with a sore knee. Following Embiid's exit, Washington targeted Simmons in the fourth quarter, choosing to send him to the free throw line in a new-age Hack-a-Shaq strategy.*      *Entering the game, Simmons was 0 for 9 from the charity stripe in the series. He was 1 of 3 in the game before the Wizards committed fully to fouling him in the fourth quarter. He split each of his four trips to the free throw line (4 for 8) to eventually end up 5 for 11 on the evening.*      *It ultimately resulted in Washington's first win of the series""*  Please tell me you aren't calling this shitshow a ""great series"" by Simmons. He had ONE good game."
"That includes a couple Wizards blowouts where Embiid was dominant and saved Simmons' ass, and one game that, to be fair, Simmons won without Embiid.   There was one Wizards game that Simmons gave away almost by himself, and of course the Hawks series.  If you replace Joel with an above-average defender, say Malcom Brogdon, I don't think the playoff stats would be that much different. Embiid is pretty amazing."
"Embiid to the Warriors for Wiggins and all three young guys and all the draft picks they can trade, would be the best move the Sixers could make. They have to start over.  And then you'd get to see Steph and Joel."
Have you watched Joel Embiid play basketball
ESPN: Joel Embiid is now forcing Danny Green to ask for a trade out of Philly.
“You’re right. I want to boo his ass too.” - Joel Embiid
I love you embiid. I hope we get something usable for you in return of that broken baby you defended for years.   Joel is the embodiment of Philly spirit and we shouldn’t waste another year of his prime with a spoiled kid who doesn’t wanna be here
"Joel ""Not the Mets"" Embiid"
"&gt;""We've all seen the videos. So that would help."" Embiid said Simmons has the potential to be that good.  -2016 Joel Embiid was asked what the team needs from Simmons if he returns."
The Sixers were also great in the playoffs with Simmons and Embiid both on the floor.  Sixers Net Rating in the regular season last year:  * Ben and Joel: +16 * Ben w/o Joel: -3 * Joel w/o Ben: +1  Sixers Net Rating in the playoffs last year:  * Ben and Joel: +18 * Ben w/o Joel: -9 * Joel w/o Ben: -4
BREAKING Espn: Joel Embiid wouldn’t say no to a trade to the warriors
All this tells me is that Joel Embiid &gt;&gt;&gt; MJ by a lot.
"They misspelled Tobias Harris name as Tobian Harris. The disrespect.  ""*His Sixers teammates, including high profile Joel Embiid, Tobian Harris and Matisse Thybulle – were willing to jump on a plane to go and convince their lost star to return*."""
&gt; imagine sweating your ass off if Trae or Jimmy get hurt early in the season. Think Sixers will finish top-5 in the East.  You do remember the sixers are the team with Joel Embiid right? hes 50x more likely to get hurt than Trae or Jimmy
Yea let’s have Kyrie screen Joel Embiid
"&gt; Embiid has always had cold or at best luke-warm things to say about Simmons.  You are literally full of crap...                   ""I love playing with Ben. Stats don’t lie. He’s an amazing player and we all didn’t get the job done."" - Joel recently.                                                    “I can’t even explain it. He’s just been different. I love playing with him and I’m sure he loves playing with me, too. I don’t know how to explain it. It’s just been fun having someone like that.” Joel Jan 2021                                         ""I love playing with Ben. He's a special talent. I think we can accomplish something special."" - Joel Feb 2020                                                  ""Like, we’ve only played for three years. The potential that we have. I love him, and I wanna be with him for the rest of my career, because I think he still has a lot of potential and me too"" - Joel July 2020"
&gt; but hes playing for a contender with a contract to match so thats not good enough.  That moves the goalposts though. Ben Simmons could contribute positively on a contender. Just not one built around Joel Embiid.
He's in that CJ McCollum tier. He's a fine player.  He's also not unplayable in the playoffs. He's unplayable in the playoffs on a team with Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris. There's a huge difference between those two statements.
"If anyone tanked Ben's value, it was the public statements made by Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers! Like the commenter below said, Ben was thrown under the bus. Now that the relationship between Ben and the entire organization has been damaged beyond repair, there is no way Ben could show up at training camp! Ben can't look at the faces of the 76ers players. Ben can't look at the faces of the entire coaching staff. No Ben is not acting like a teenager. He has been hurt very badly! Maybe Morey should have told Joel Embiid and Doc Rivers not to say anything bad about Ben Simmons publicly but it's too late now. No Morey is not trying to get a good deal. Morey is trying to get an incredible deal but when you've publicly ripped apart one of your own starters, you've already lowered their value beyond repair!"
"Yeah that’s totally why guys like Tim Duncan suddenly become irrelevant and never won a ring after the year 2000 /s   Or it’s not like Shaq didn’t play post rule change either. The reason post play died is because generational big men with skills, size, and athleticism don’t grow on trees. The last 2 big men with that potential were made of glass. One was Greg oden and the current one is Joel embiid who despite missing tons of time and losing some of his mobility is still an mvp and dpoy candidate.    We will get another one eventually. Just look at how much Giannis dominates with no jump shot and not nearly as big or strong as guys like Shaq."
The idea that Denver would trade Jamal Murray for any deal involving Ben Simmons is the most hilarious thing I've heard in a long time. Ben Simmons + Joel Embiid doesn't get you Jamal! You could put up half of Philly and Denver would have to be stark raving crazy to give it any consideration.  Denver needs to improve their defense without doubt. But that's much more straightforward than dealing their core assets for speculative assets in return. Ben + 2 first round picks doesn't get you Jamal.
Trae because of his floater/lob hidden fastball broke the 2nd and 3rd best PNR defense in the playoffs. He made Joel Embiid a below average defender damn near. If trae was playing against the clippers they wouldn't have been able to play any of their big men.
"I'm not disagreeing with you that Nets would be favorite, but to write off the 6ers when they have prime Joel Embiid matched up against a team with no real competent C is silly, especially if they trade Simmons for literally any above average PG. Anything can happen, that's why they play the game."
https://www.awesemo.com/sideaction/joel-embiid-speaks-out-rift-ben-simmons-trade-philadelphia-76ers-sixers-nba-bjs/  You’re a moron
"I don't blame Ben. The coach and Joel Embiid dumped on him, then the whole media world and 76ers fanbase dumped on him, no one defended him. If he was my star player, I would not do that. 76ers organization have no one to blame but themselves for this unfortunate situation. Just salvage what trade value he has left, get CJ McCollum or Ty Haliburton and Buddy Hield for him."
Like Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid. Too bad they listened to Ben Simmons and Brett Brown and now the Sixers have/had to get rid of both
"The Process is Joel Embiid, that's it."
"Offtopic: what a weird way to describe who was going. ""Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Matisse Thybulle and most of the team"". Why not just say ""Most of the team"", or ""Sixers players""?"
Dirk played better in the playoffs and didn’t play with someone like Joel embiid cmon dude
"criticism for his performance in the playoffs has ramped up every year and reached a boiling point this season after he disappeared and they were eliminated, and in post-game press conferences his coach and the other star player joel embiid kind of called him out. from that point on he said he wouldn't return."
"Adam Silver killed the process when he installed Jerry Colangelo's failson as our GM and he proceeded to fuck up the majority of our high picks. The Hawks simply provided the final nail in the coffin.  Now ""The Process"" is just Joel Embiid."
Hell yeah him on a scrappy team that’s one defender away from being insane. Like Atlanta would be interesting trae not having to be abused on d and Ben literally doesn’t have to score. Embiid and Simmons never was gonna work. The team they have and Joel wanting to post up bens literally useless you need him surrounded by shooters and he can attack the paint. His usage has dropped he doesn’t need to shoot and he can be a secondary ball handler he’s just a more athletic less defensively sound draymond really. If the 6ers keep him I’d honestly have him in a 2015 iggy role where he comes in on certain matchups and rotations for the betterment of the team. Tobias Simmons and embiid on paper will never work
just a reminder than Joel Embiid had one of the worst halves of basketball ever in game 4
"Sixers momentarily have the best nickname duo in the NBA,  Joel 'The Process' Embiid and Ben 'Young Socialite' Simmons"
I got two words for you:   Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. Must see TV.
Lol…yes nothing is ben Simmons fault when this man passed up on an open dunk and Joel Embiid supporting this man FOR YEARS because he donest take a jump shot.  …yup it’s not his fault.
"&gt; The core leaders on the 76ers — such as Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris and Matisse Thybulle — and most of the team were set to take a jet to see Simmons before being turned away, sources said. Multiple sources said Simmons didn’t want his teammates, some of whom he considers friends, to make the Philadelphia-to-Los Angeles commute out of courtesy because he won’t change his mind on wanting a trade.  It's nice of you to not have them waste their time, but at least give them a chance Ben"
"There’s no need to be aggressive. You shouldn’t attempt to discuss basketball if you’re going to get defensive over someone disagreeing with you.  Yes I understand that Steph and Klay play a huge part in Draymond’s playmaking. But following that same logic, considering the Cavs wouldn’t have anyone near Steph or Klay in that regard (and no, Garland won’t be close), then that would mitigate how impactful Simmons can be as a half court playmaker.  &gt;On Philly you have Joel camped in the paint the majority of the game and multiple bodies down low to limit his game…  I fail to see how a lineup consisting of Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen offers *more* spacing than a lineup consisting of Seth Curry and Joel Embiid. Curry is a much better shooter than Garland, and Embiid at least shoots the three a little where Allen doesn’t at all. In fact, a starting lineup with Simmons, Allen and Mobley might just be the worst spacing lineup in the league. There offence would almost certainly be last in the league."
Joel Embiid. Everyone on the Knicks is such ass that I can’t even pick one guy as someone I’d watch
If it hadn't been said here already: Ben Simmons as he is now will never win an NBA championship note will Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid together. Also Ben Simmons is no superstar.
"Joel ""crybaby"" Embiid."
I’m not saying Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid is Kawhi Leonard and Paul George but yeah that’s what I’m saying
"i do not under any circumstance want to see a philly squad with joel embiid, seth curry, cj mcollum, tobias harris, and danny green. so help me god i will fly to america and burn down philadelphia myself to stop that dominance from rising."
"I cannot imagine how it must feel to have everyone tell you that you are the sole reason your team didn't make it to the next round. I criticize him for not attacking the rim more this series, for not taking that dunk, for missing so many free throws (not really something he can control), but I can't put an entire series on one guy.   But everyone else will. And the shame of it is his teammates and coach seem to be doing absolutely nothing to take some of the blame away from him. And they absolutely deserve some. Even my favorite player, the guy I call the best two-way player in the world, my MVP, Joel Embiid. He isn't blameless in this series or this game. Eight turnovers? Falling asleep multiple times on defense while Trae zips a pass right by your head?  And he was the best player for us I could go down the list.   Point is I feel bad for Ben. People act like he doesn't care but anyone would. To know you're in your own head and still not be able to do anything about it must be rough."
Pretty sure NBA scouts and FOs are not gonna rely on what Joel Embiid has to say about Ben Simmons in a freakin' interview
"i mean i dont think it's totally fair to compare it to what ty lue said to what joel/doc said, since the sixers season is now over while Ty Lue still has more basketball to coach. Like as far as i know doc was basically saying up till yesterday that his strategy was to believe in simmons.   These comments might make it more difficult to bring simmons back into the locker room next season, but if you look at these comments as a strong signal that doc/embiid want simmons out, it's not as bad imo. (Who really cares about simmons' feelings if he isnt on the team anymore)"
"Ben Simmons, you played the like the Flyers post-COVID season; no effort. Your rebound and assists looks nice, but no one cares. You didn’t care, which is the fucking bare minimum you have to do.   Sixers fans shouldn’t have thrown debris, but anyone getting on Sixers fans for booing needs to shut up! I would boo, too!   Tobias didn’t have a good game, but at least he tried!   Seth Curry and Joel Embiid should punch Ben’s ass until he finally gives a care."
Nah put Joel Embiid at center and trade the problem instead of building around the problem and trading the runner up MVP.
[The East runs through ~~Joel Embiid~~ Kevin Huerter](https://twitter.com/blackdragonroll/status/1406819411269410823?s=20)
PG: Jamal Murray (2016)  SG: Devin Booker (2015)  SF: Michael Porter Jr (2018)  PF: Jayson Tatum (2017)  C: Joel Embiid (2014)
Blaming Matt Ryan for that loss is like blaming Joel Embiid for the Sixers loss tonight.
And you have people ripping Rivers for making a harsh comment about Ben. I guarantee you Embiid is pissed at Simmons and is tired of the organization coddling Ben. Joel is the franchise. You keep him happy. Rivers comments would let Joel know the org has his back
"shit is pristine bro. after all the shit they got into stemming from Jokic-Embiid MVP race, having Embiid get as many first place votes as Derrick Rose and then choke again (yes Simmons was a bigger problem, Joel also fucked up a lot) could not be sweeter. And exactly in the way we said it would happen all year"
"That excerpt about Morey is interesting. It doesn't seem like he had a clear vision for a team around Embiid and kind of latched on to the advanced numbers of a team 3-4 years ago (Covington, Ben, JJ, Dario, Joel) and tried to more or less recreate it. Hopefully he has a clear vision this offseason."
"Joel Embiid: ""I'll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we — I don't know how to say it — is when we had an open shot and we made one free throw...""  He kinda just did"
"Hah, I mean, Is he even good at managing superstar egos anymore? The way some of his players on LAC and PHI act on the court wasn't exemplary of this. The emotional and sometimes ridiculous actions/reactions by Blake Griffin, CP3, Joel Embiid and Dwight Howard all come to mind."
"&gt;Full quote from Joel Embiid: ""I mean, I'll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we — I don't know how to say it — but I thought the turning point was just we had an open shot and we made one free throw and we missed the other and then they came down and scored...  &gt;""We didn't get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he made a 3 and then from there down four, it's on me. I turned the ball over and tried to make something happen from the perimeter. But I thought that was the turning point.""  Courtesy of u/Sdas_"
I feel bad for Joel Embiid who has to drag Simmons overpaid/overrated ass around.
Yeah no doubt he’s great in the regular season rebounding. Ben’s Simmons was great in the regular reason. You see anyone saying he’s a great player? He didn’t average 14 rebounds against embiid on a hurt knee that’s for sure. Seems liked he barely got any offensive rebounds the whole series. Hunter would have actually contained curry and gave us a shooting and shot creating threat besides a hurt bogi. So Idk how a lob threat center who only gets defensive rebounds and dunks that can’t contain Joel embiid is worth more than a shot creating mid range and 3 point threat who can actually play good defense.
"LOOOOLLLLLL you nephews acted like Luka played like an ass ala Ben Simmons out there eh? One, his FO and team is bad compared to the Suns and Hawks. Ayton is not even the 2nd best player in his team (I'm not dissing him bec he's actually good; Im just stating facts). Second, The Hawks played the Knicks and Sixers that has Joel Embiid as the lone star while his robin is busy bricking fts and cowering to shoot an open dunk. The Mavs played an MJ-incarnate, the best version of PG, and deep ass roster. Without Kawhi, the clips busted the ""number one team in the nba"", and you put this on Luka? Third, the problem of the Mavs is stemming from their shadow gm."
"I always knew Simmons was holding Embiid back regardless of the results. How is Embiid getting double teamed every possession and still drops the most points on our team?    Every time Joel touches the ball it's near the 3 point line, he has to back up his opponent all the way to the paint just to get double teamed. Most superstars can play 1v1 vs their opponent, Joel RARELY plays 1v1, he always gets doubled. No wonder he gets gassed easy and don't forget the defensive load. Tisse and Ben can play aggressive on the perimeter because Joel can clean up anything inside.   I'm honestly tired of pretending everything is okay, we wasted prime years of Joel, imagine if Joel had a PG that could shoot decently. He'd be averaging way more and would fix up spacing issues for the rest."
"False, that's Joel Embiid who has 501 points in 919 possessions. You're assuming he's shooting on every possession and that his make or miss is the only outcome. Those are 919 team possessions, not Embiid possessions.   The team ORTG in those 919 possessions is actually 117.5 which is pretty great"
"Yeah, because John Collins is better than Joel Embiid /s"
"Joel embiid is unhappy.  ""Like, very unhappy."""
I feel bad for Joel Embiid. He is literally the only reason Im a Sixers fan. Im not a Philly native by the way so I have no allegiance to Philadelphia teams.
Look to see Clint have a much better series too now that he’s not guarding fucking Joel Embiid
Doc definitely has blame but Ben needs to be traded. He needs to play with a player like Dame not Joel embiid.
It's almost like they need to build a team around the MVP candidate Joel Embiid. That's a fucking genius idea.
"&gt;Joel Embiid: ""I'll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we — I don't know how to say it — is when we had an open shot and we made one free throw...""  https://twitter.com/rich_hofmann/status/1406817068813635586"
"They’ve run out. If they lost to the full strength nets in like 6 or 7 then you could say tough luck. Losing to the Hawks when Trae young shoots absolutely abysmal is insane.  Tobias Harris was trying to do too much, Joel Embiid carried offensively but had moments where he made terrible decisions, Simmons (lmao). The sixers role players really didn’t play all that terribly. They need someone who can create his own shot better than Toby and someone who isn’t a liability on offense like Simmons."
What do you guys think of trading Joel Embiid for the rights to Big Baby Davis?
"I agree that the best system for Ben would be like the Giannis offensive system, but that would assume he wants to be aggressive and will at least try to improve. He hasn’t improved (except maybe defensively since year one or two).   I feel so sorry for Embiid. That guy always improves. He puts his body on the line and is always trying so hard. He’s had a bunch of injuries, but STILL gets better. That’s so tough. His game has massively improved all over the place. Meanwhile, Ben has whole seasons where he doesn’t attempt a three. I’m all for knowing who you are as a player, but it is clear he doesn’t practice three point shooting, because someone who does would want to see that practice manifest on the court. Imagine Joel Embiid surrounded by 4 shooters!!!  I’m a Heat fan and on the last game of the season, we blew a huge game which flipped where we were in the bracket. I didn’t want to play the Bucks because we aren’t as good without Crowder (most notably) and the Bicks would be insanely motivated after we pretty much embarrassed them last year.  Also, guarding Ben Simmons is soooo easy. He averages 18 or however much during the regular season, because teams don’t game plan as much, but you don’t have to guard Ben at the three and can just sink down under the free throw line basically. Teams actually try to get on him during the regular season. I’ve seen soooo many teams guard him at the three or get up in his grill. Why?!?! Just use your Ben defender as like a free safety in football, lol.   Yesterday, I posted about Doc, but I feel sorry for him too, because this team can’t win with Ben and Embiid. A few years ago, some people actually thought it would be better to build around Ben. (I think Embiid was a bit out of shape and such at the time). At least that argument is over."
Joel Embiid dominating in the paint with Curry and Klay running around the perimeter and cutting getting easy shots. They would beat Brooklyn.
"are you serious lmao. let's ignore ben, 6ers top players are the mvp runnernup joel embiid, a pure scorer in tobias harris, flamethrower seth curry, all nba defender matisse thybulle, a veteran george hill, shake milton and a pretty good rookie imo tyrese. you wanna do a side by side against the hawks' best players?  even by your argument that the hawks are at the nare minimum very close to philly, philly got outcoached"
My opinion as a sixers fan trying to be rational.  This year proved one thing.  Ben and Joel will never win a championship together.  Both are good players and have their strengths but they do not compliment each other once the playoff level intensity hits.  Embiid cannot be a closer playing the 5.  Teams can clog it up and he won't get boarderline calls.  He needs a true closer/finisher to pair up with.  Ben needs an open paint to attack and many shooters/other scorers who do not need to be ball dominant.   A CJ for Ben trade is fair value wise given recent performance and contracts but it does not solve the sixers problems.  Although to get any asset after the last series with that max deal we may have to take what we can get.
"If Joel Embiid demands a trade, I wouldn't be mad"
 Embiid handled it way better.   LeBron was visibly and vocally frustrated at JR and he let him know and even Ty Lue on the bench when he found out the unused TO as well (not saying Bron getting mad wasn't warranted) but Joel still managed to calmly talk to Ben and dap him up
" Joel Embiid hasn't proven anything in the playoffs and if you say ""he's injured"" everytime, idk if that's better or worse."
I feel bad for Embiid. Brett Brown did him so dirty with that 2019 offseason.  I truly believe Joel Embiid is a championship caliber player. He just doesn't have the Robin that he needs to get it done on this Sixers team.
"If Joel Embiid is putting up 25/10 nightly on a torn meniscus in extremely close games with a decent amount of turnovers I would reckon that without a torn meniscus he would play better than that, he was already doing basically a carry job with a torn meniscus up until they lost this game.  Joel Embiid with proper lateral movement and explosiveness doesn’t give up 6 turnovers in a night."
Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are the new TrashBros.     Harris is just an overpaid player
I want to see kemba throw up 40 a game on the Celtics during his revenge tour after presti releases him into the East again.  The kemba-embiid pr would honestly be absolutely unguardable those 2 are filthy.  Kemba was murdering people with enes kanter last season imagine him with Joel.
"Joel embiid is unhappy.  ""Like, really unhappy."""
Even if he does its too little too late  If I was Joel Embiid idk how I would even be able to look at the guy first 5 attempts in game 7 of 2019 now this???  Jimmy was right about the sixers
"Joel was looking like 2016 chubby Embiid that had no pace or flow, wore himself out, and would just try to force his way through brick walls and made dumb kickouts"
Joel Embiid is playing on a torn meniscus you knobhead  And Danny Green
"I don't even know what else to say other than that this version of the Sixers is just the same team we've seen for the past few years. Embiid, Simmons, and Harris have never advanced past the second round and this is now their third attempt to do so, with the most favorable matchup they've had in that run.  I remember back in 2018 against the Celtics, and a lot of it just looked the same. Joel was a turnover machine in big moments, Simmons was an offensive liability, and no one on the bench could come up and play to the moment.  The hawks are a little inexperienced, Yes, and maybe that will cost them against Milwaukee. But the Sixers have no experience outside of Danny Green and Dwight Howard going deep into the playoffs."
And one guy is an MVP going to the conference finals…the other is Joel Embiid. He wishes he was Giannis instead of the fragile empty stats player that he is
"I cannot believe this fucking timeline, man. Joel Embiid and Ben ""A jumpshot away from being LeBron James"" Simmons just got eliminated by the Italian Stallion and Ginger Klay Thompson.  What the fuck."
Man I always root for the team that knocks us out (minus Lakers) but I want the hawks now just cuz they took Joel embiid out
Lol you can see Joel Embiid getting visibly pissed.
Joel Embiid has sure made it easy to root against him and revel in his failures
Who wins?   The Joel Embiid led Philadelphia 76ers 🥵🔥🔥💦  or   one ginger boi
Joel Embiid has no business in that list lmao. 30 turnovers in 2 games or shit
Joel Embiid... You trash  Tobias Harris... You trash.  Ben Simmons.. Ben Simmons listen to me when I say this: You are trash.
"Joel ""Crybaby"" Embiid off to Cancun."
"Joel ""Crybaby"" Embiid off to Cancun."
"Trae Young will be in the ECF before Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, that is hilarious  Also, Simmons needs Markelle Fultz's shooting coach"
"The difference in the series: Trae Young and Kevin Huerter are killers, and Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons are not. 8 turnovers and 4 shots taken are unacceptable from them."
Joel embiid and James Harden out back to back nights. we are truly blessed
Joel Embiid
"They don't call him Joel ""Turnover Machine"" Embiid for nothing! And yet so many are upset with me after I coined the name. But it's so accurate?"
Damn Philly played like absolute trash. Everyone except Joel Embiid and Seth Curry should be imprisoned for life and Ben Simmons should probably be executed

"And he went to the finals last year.   It's a lot easier to look good in the playoffs playing next to Joel Embiid than with the talent Jimmy played with this year, especially with Bam in a funk in the playoffs.   It's also easier to look good when you're being guarded by Trae Young and Kevin Huerter instead of Giannis Antetekoumpo."
"What a deflection bringing up Randle never change Philly lmao there's a few people saying he should be ejected it's not a concensus opinion or anything. There are Sixers fans in this thread saying it's puzzling Joel is the only person getting fined. That being said, **if** someone is getting ejected from this, it's 100% Embiid. He's the only one doing dumb shit"
"In a team with Joel Embiid that utilizes the foul rules of today more than most, if not all,  you have 0 excuses for not knowing which warrants a flagrant or just a hard foul"

Joel Embiid is talking shit and complaining at the refs face after every play including the one that just occurred rn and Trae was the only one with a tech but okay everyone is against Philly right lol?
Trey Young vs Joel Embiid is picking up where Embiid vs Westbrook left off. Finish one beef and fire up another
Imagine posting this in a game featuring Joel Embiid
Does Joel Embiid have a tiny dick or something? This dude never stops whining.
Joel “Are you not entertained” Embiid
Joel Embiid is awful without the refs bailing him out like that
Joel Embiid is not a bobble head the entire time he dribbles.
\- fan of team that employs Joel Embiid
Anyone and everyone is welcome to be a Philly fan as long as they trust in our savior Joel Embiid.
"You’re excusing John Collins kicking someone, I’m excusing Joel Embiid walking into someone."
"Love Cousins, but Embiid easily. healthy Cousins would still regularly miss 20-30 games per season like Embiid, and Joel is significantly better defensively while being a tad worse on offense"
"Collins literally kicked Embiid, but yeah Joel was the one who escalated things."
"The article literally says    &gt;The NBA fined Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid $35,000 on Sunday for his on-court altercation with Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins in Game 6 of their second-round playoff series Friday."
It looks like he was trying to pull away but a normal sized person like that cannot physically impact Joel embiid one way or another
"But none compare to the Maestro, Joel ""Meryl Streep"" Embiid, when it comes to flopping."
And Joel Embiid cost us our previous best shot at a title in over a decade at the same age Ben is now.
OP is joel embiid!??
"I had the sixer and suns so i still got one left. Sixers take the cake tho. Simmons shits everyone up, Joel Embiid gets finals MVP."
Classy Joel Embiid
MVP 1st place votes:  91 — Nikola Jokic 5 — Steph Curry 2 — Chris Paul 1 — Joel Embiid 1 — Giannis Antetokounmpo 1 — Derrick Rose
Joel Embiid was running away with the MVP at some point during the season.
I had to look it up. Holy shit.  Joel Embiid and Derrick Rose are tied for 1st place votes this year (1).
Weird way to spell Joel Embiid
"Joel Embiid - he just got injured too much, as always."
That’s not how you spell Joel Hans Embiid
"It should be Jokic and not embiid this year, but Joel has shown that he's definitely MVP worthy in the future. I think he can lock it down, if he isn't hampered by injuries."
"&gt;Nets: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmp, and Joel Embiid            Welcome to the 2022 NBA Season!"
Or you can take Luka and trade him for fucking Joel Embiid if you want a center that badly  Luka is by far the most valuable asset in the league right now
"Shaq as he has often said grew up with a military step-dad and a lot of how he acts towards others, especially motivationally, is largely a result of that. He’s all about tough love, and some players like Joel Embiid respond well to it. Others don’t."
bro why do people care if everytime joel embiid dunks the ball he is awarded 7 points??
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/joel-embiid-plans-to-push-through-knee-pain-to-be-available-for-76ers-im-going-to-give-everything-i-got/
"Because he hasn’t played well enough and can’t hit his free throws. Washed up. Next round, they’ll need him against Embiid. Probably the most capable defense against Joel."
Non-injured Joel Hans Embiid
Don't compare Embiid and Giannis in the post. It's disrespectful to Joel
"They sure can trade For Dame without giving up Simmons, but I’m sure the Sixers wanna keep Joel Embiid"
Dame was pretty unstoppable against the nuggets. Curry was dropping 32 ppg while being triple teamed. Luka was responsible for 31/37 of the Dallas Mavericks baskets that one game. Tatum and D-book dropped 50 and 47 (respectively) to beat good teams. Joel Embiid I’d Joel Embiid. And Trae Young can’t be stopped by DPOY candidate Ben Simmons. And Kawhi terminated the mavs.  This league has so many unstoppable offensive threats
It would have to be something insane like Joel embiid wanting out and the warriors getting him for Andrew Wiggins + all the picks
"The Bucks second or third best players are #3s on any true championship caliber team. This was so predictable. I didn’t expect these games to be blowouts but the people that think the 76ers and Bucks are comparable to the Nets. They’re not.   It’s a star league. The Nets have the best two in the conference. Why do people think that Joel and Ben Simmons of all people have a shot? Why do people think the bucks are going anywhere with Kris Middleton as their second best player? Or Jrue Holiday? If any of those players outside of Embiid ever scored 30 in a playoff game, those cities would throw a parade.   NBA fans do this crap every single year and it’s so comical. It’s a star driven league. Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday…those aren’t stars. Ben Simmons is not a star. This was the expected result.   Nobody should have predicted blowouts in the first two games but Khris Middleton? Jrue Holiday? They score 30 in any game and it’s like a miracle."

"Would need to do something important in the playoffs, which for the Nets, they won’t play real competition like Joel Embiid or Trae Young until round 3.  Sometimes you can be a big contributor while barely playing though. KD in the 2019 finals is a good example. Had Klay not gotten injured and they won in 7, even though KD only played 12 minutes, those 12 minutes were needed for the Warriors to win the hypothetical championship."
"Oh. Sorry I assumed it was a typo and you meant to say:  ""True, though: how many guys are there in the nba that grew up like DRose playing on outdoor courts all day long""  Which is why I responded the way that I did. I completely agree with your mentality though. No matter what some of those players will play the game of basketball. Joel Embiid for example started playing on a nailed on, bent hoop in a dirt court (or something very similar to that)."
Pretty big difference between having fun with the fans and making a burner to shit talk Joel Embiid.
Trae and Joel are probably the 2 worst offenders in the league for trying to draw contact and fish for fouls. Having said that... the gap between Trae and Embiid in terms of bullshit playstyle is astronomical. Watching Trae play is.... unwatchable to me
"That's mostly only true because when you are an NBA prospect level player, you usually get access to top level facilities some way or another. For example, LeBron James grew up homeless for a while, but still ended up at St. Vincent St. Mary's. Hell, Joel Embiid was flown across the Atlantic to be able to go to school in the US. Yao Ming was molded to be a basketball player from birth, in top of the line facilities. When you have incredible potential, people will make things happen for you."
"Jokic is as big and ~ as strong as Embiid, and a better shooter/more efficient scorer/harder to stop, but their FTr is hugely disparate. This is despite Jokic taking a higher % of his shots in the paint and restricted area than joel, who takes a ton of long 2s and fadeaways. It’s primarily because of the flops or “selling contact” as you may refer to it."
meanwhile Joel Embiid cant seem to stay healthy and he wasnt a part of AAU
"KP needs to bulk up and take advantage of the 20 extra centimeters he has when facing a small ball lineup.   When they switch a guard onto him he still shoots.  All he needs is to post up small players around 4 possessions per game, not like he's being asked to turn into Joel Embiid.  And Luka dominates the ball because that's (most likely) the best strategy in order for the Mavs to win. Kristaps shot 30% from 3 this series, all he did was cut a couple times per game and dunk it (and he should've done it more often), didn't pick it up when Luka was on the bench, took bad shots, didn't grab rebounds... he wants to play like JJ Redick but without the shot making and without utilizing his hugeness."
"Now I know this dude didn't watch Embiid spaz out in the paint in game 1. You'd think Trae's ""foul-baiting"" would be off the table after watching Joel fight imaginary demons for four quarters lol"
A sixers team with a Joel Embiid at 80% at best and a broken Ben Simmons?   You really think that team stands a better chance than the Hawks who may be getting Cam Reddish back in the line up soon should we win tonight
"simmons is a better defender than jrue, thybulle is on the same level. joel embiid is hobbled."
I say that because the Sixers have the guy who finished #2 in MVP voting in Joel Embiid who can match up with Giannis. Trae will get locked up by Jrue
And that motherfucker Joel Embiid talks about how refs don't give him any calls lol
"Yeah I play, I’ve had people fall on me twice my weight I waited for them to get up not kick them because that exasperates the situation it makes seem hostile. Every time u send a message it goalposts change. First there was not kick, then there was kick but u wouldn’t say it’s a kick, then it’s the kick isn’t that bad then it’s well he was just getting him off him so which is it I’m standing my ground the fact u change ur story every message is just proof there lying for no reason.   Joel Embiid hit him he shoulda got the flagrant Collins even with the kick is fustrated but not the initiation of the altercation Embiid takes the kick bad then gets up and the situation continues Embiid with open arms basically backs down Collins while trae pushes him in the back that’s what happened when u say otherwise ur lying"
Joel Embiid will force a trade to the Nets imo
Joel Embiid bullies his way to the FT line enough to eek it out. I hope I’m wrong because Atl-Mil seems like it’d be a more entertaining series.
"Quick, get JJ Barea on the phone! We need someone to check Joel Embiid!"
"Joel Embiid, then Giannis, then Devin Booker IMO"
"Joel ""The Process"" Embiid"
The same answer Toronto had in 2019. Stick an elite perimeter defender on him (Kawhi—Simmons) and use the bigs to create a wall in the paint (Gasol—Embiid).  Even in prior years we’ve had decent success just sticking Joel on Giannis straight up.  We are a different animal than Brooklyn was defensively. Obviously though less skilled offensively.
This dude is a killer.   I worry more about him holding the ball than Ben Simmons or even tbh Joel Embiid.  If the Sixers win game 7 it's gonna be because of Tyrese Maxey and Seth Curry
"Sorry to piggy back. Been holding this in for 5 years since Durant signed with the Warriors and everyone crowned him the GOAT whilst everything LeBron ever did was wrong:   Alright I got my hater goggles on, I’ve been waiting for this shit all season.  1. Maybe Durant should’ve scored 51 instead of 48.  2. Bitch couldn’t even tie the game twice. How do you air all a shot like that.  3. It’s ok, maybe Durant can try and compete next year, once he convinces Joel Embiid and Dame Lillard to join the nets too.  4. I wonder if Steph is sitting around somewhere smiling  5. I wonder if Russ is sitting around somewhere and smiling  6. Look at that Durant is finally forced to play defence and he gets tired at the end of a game. Colour me shocked 😮.  7. Durant looking around like where’s Draymond  8. Kevin Durants a front runner who can’t make the shot when it matters most.   9. So the cap is 3, 3 at minimum generational talent teammates for Durant to be able to win a playoffs series."
"Well except they did actually expose some degree of defensive “weakness,” although it’s more like “less-greatness”  The Clippers didn’t go small for defensive reasons, they did it so they could play five out with a bunch of dudes who can shoot.  This A: neutralizes Gobert’s world class rim protection to a certain extent, because he has to, say, guard Marcus Morris on the 3pt line, because Marcus Morris had the 2nd highest 3pt % in the league and leaving him open is bad.   B: Gobert is 7 something feet tall, and while I’d say he’s Pretty Good at perimeter defense for being a Giant Human, stifling perimeter defense is not exactly his *forte*. He gets by ok because of his relative speed and his hops and his crazy long arms, but if I asked you to envision the ideal guy to defend Marcus Morris, Gobert probably isn’t the first guy you’d think of, even if he is far from the last.  The defense “weakness” could here also be termed a “relative lack of strength,” but it *is* there.  It goes hand in hand with the offensive limitations; that stuff about Gobert being a giant human and how it relates perimeter defense vs run protection are true for, say, Joel Embiid to a certain extent too. Getting Embiid out of the paint when you’re on offense is totally something that teams will try to do. But teams also know that going small against Embiid means he is going to bbq them terribly on the other end of the floor.  (Also, I think Embiid actually might be a little better than Gobert on the perimeter, but maybe that’s just me.)"
"If Ben can’t stop Trae, what makes you think he can stop Giannis? Every time Giannis plays against the Sixers he always has his way, regardless of if Ben is defending him or not. It’s much easier to say ‘have Joel foul everyone that’s on him’. It literally took KD until OT to foul out Tucker and it wasn’t even KD, it was Griffin who was fouled by Tucker. The Bucks aren’t a good match up for the Sixers because Holiday will take Curry, Middleton on Harris, Lopez on Joel and they have no answer for Giannis. Then you’ve still got Tucker who will guard any player besides Embiid that may be having a big game. Simmons has proven he is a liability during the playoffs, the Sixers look lost against Atlanta in the clutch who are much smaller than the Bucks, now imagine how much harder it’ll be to score against the Bucks. If Joel can go 0/12 against Atlanta, he can be shut down by the Bucks. The ECF is the Bucks to lose."
LeBron whines a ton now but has been murdered in the paint back in the heat and cavs pt 2 days after he developed that post up game.  I literally can not watch Trae young or Joel embiid play. They flop even worse and complain even harder.
Joel embiid was hurt so Lebron became the betting favorite.
I think Joel Embiid Trae Young Chris Paul Ben Simmons Paul GeorgeDevin Booker and Seth Curry are on that echelon of popularity. In that order.
"Jokic is playing mostly skill game. He's refereed terribly overall. And he still won MVP.  Difference between whistle he's getting compared to fellow big man Embiid is night and day. And no, it's not because Joel is playing more physically. Jokic literally doesn't get fouls at similar rate when he's straight up hacked.   And compared to perimeter players the difference is infuriating indeed."
I don’t agree with this. Joel is the same guy who uses his body to smash through people. Of course the defender is allowed to body them back. Watching Embiid foul bait the entire game is embarrassing considering he uses his giant body to push defensive players out of the way. If both big play and guard play was reffed with the touch fouls guards get centers would literally shoot free throws every single time they touch the ball.
Stephen Curry does 1 dribble and shoots it. Jimmy Butler does 2 dribbles and shoots it. James Harden takes 1 dribble and shoots it. Trae Young takes 1 free throw and shoots it. Joel Embiid takes 1 dribble and shoots it.  Giannis taking 6 dribbles before shooting his free throw is the problem.
"Starring Trae Young, James Harden, Luka Doncic, and Joel Embiid"
Joel Embiid
"Joel Embiid is a hundred percent right. You blow on a perimeter player it's a foul. Meanwhile, Guards and centers can pommel bigs with grass knuckles and refs will ignore that crap. This is not fun to watch and needs to be fixed in the off season"
Joel embiid
How can you not take it seriously? I just stated a fact that is backed by actual numbers. Something that does NOT apply to Joel Embiid
I can’t take you seriously when Joel embiid is on your team
"Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic would murder Dwight, he struggled like crazy to guard Pau and Jokic is Pau's skills on steroids, plus bigger."
The Cavs doctors said no.  The book Tanking to the Top has a some great stories about Embiid's workout with the Cavs. Read this: https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/joel-embiid-sixers-2014-nba-draft-cavaliers-david-griffin-milwaukee-bucks
It was. This came up   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25074729/joel-embiid-philadelphia-76ers-warned-flopping-andre-drummond-detroit-pistons-technical-foul-rescinded%3fplatform=amp
" I'm prepared for the downvotes from people that don't watch the Sixers, but Ben has also sacrificed his scoring output this year. Doc has had him in the dunker's spot like Brett bit he's been way more successful without the ball in his hands this year and has taken way fewer shots. He doesn't seem to care about taking shots or scoring a lot, he just sets up his teammates and lets Joel and Tobias go to work in the block.   Also Doc, even before he became the Sixers coach, has always preferred three out with one in the dunker's spot, as opposed to four out when someone is in the post. Derek Bodner and Rich Hoffman of the Athletic told us that right after he was hired.   Ben's numbers are down, his usage is down, he takes whatever defensive assignment Doc gives him, comes off the court when told to and takes pride in seeing his teammates up. He has never complained about his role the entire year. Not saying he can't be and doesn't deserve criticism, he does. Just saying the notion that he is just an anchor around Embiid's neck (like Collins last night) isn't true. People can't just leave him wide open under the rim, it doesn't happen. And the team struggles mightily to get Embiid the ball in the simplest of sets without him.   They have always helped each other, and this year is no different."
"My dude if Joel Embiid got touched by a feather he would fall down and get a whistle. Some big men do get mauled without getting calls, Embiid is not one of them and he's the last person I want to hear this shit from lol"
I know fucking Joel Embiid isn't complaining about officiating
"He has the ultimate move of stepping back to create distance, but if a defender tries to close in and defend it, he shoots with a forward leg motion so it's going to be called a foul because he needs to land...  I hope the NBA takes a look at how offensive players are baiting for fouls too much. The players are much too talented with skill to have to resort to that crap just Incase they missed the shot. Joel Embiid, Harden, Trae Young, and sometimes Middleton does it too but his is more off a pump fake. Still... Just irks me how defense gets punished."
"Joel Embiid has to understand this isn’t 80’s - 90’s basketball anymore.  It’s like the NFL protecting the QB (TB12), they protect those little guys that shoot the 3."
Obvious like a fan base coming up with an excuse for why it happens so much? Hmmm  https://6abc.com/sports/why-in-the-world-does-joel-embiid-fall-down-so-much/5292266/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/05/10/joel-embiid-falls-down-a-lot-because-his-doctors-told-him-to/amp/
I can't decide between the two jokes:  So I guess Philly doesn't trust the process anymore?  So it depends more on the result than Joel Embiid?
"Size gets punished, except if you're Joel Embiid. Then you can flop all over the place"
"Because Joel was referring to the most recent game. So I only included the most recent games.   That clip is excluding up to it where Joel got destroyed by Capela and didn’t get any calls. Yes he overreacted to sell the moment, but Capella still pushed him. It was cheap by Embiid but it was in reaction to the refs letting Capela play beyond what is the normal physicality of the game on the other end.   The second clip is an offensive foul on Embiid followed up by a double tech. I don’t know what that proves…  I’m not really sure why you’re bringing up all these things that have nothing to do with what Embiid said. I don’t know that I agree with Embiid but I atleast recognize his point. It’s the same argument Shaq used to make. That because he is bigger and stronger the refs won’t call fouls the same because they don’t look as severe."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Joel Embiid saying this?
Joel Embiid is about to watch a monkey paw curl. They're gonna call every foul for Philly's point guard this game. Simmons is going to live at the line and glare at Embiid the whole time.
"How would him stopping foul baiting make any difference. Are you seriously suggesting the solution to the problem is that every player makes a gentleman's agreement to never do it? That's fucking ludicrous. Players gonna do what they can get away with to win, and in the meantime they can voice their concerns about officiating. I don't get what's wrong with that.  &gt;Are you trying to say he’s not a hypocrite for doing what he’s complaining about?  No, of course I'm not saying that. He complained about **officiating,** read the quote. Joel Embiid **is not** a referee hence **he does not do any officiating.** Thus he cannot do what he complained about, it is impossible.  If Embiid decided to take the moral highground now, would Trae too? No way. Trae would shoot 15FTs, Embiid would ""*be the change he wishes to see""* and get fucking bounced from the playoffs. And for what? So *now* he is allowed to complain. Makes no damn sense."
"Tf you mean? You ever watch the best offensive action Embiid ever has with Philly? That looks unstoppable, still til this day the best offensive play the 76ers ever ran for Embiid..  It’s the JJ Redick Joel Embiid 2 men game where it’s on the left block and Embiid come out for a hand off, screen and roll; or JJ screen for his man and drop off the pass for Rolling Embiid"
Like Embiid or Joel
“Joel Embiid.... you will... REST... IN... PEACE!”
