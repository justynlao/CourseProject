And y‚Äôall call lamarcus Aldridge washed(note that he is in fact actually washed)
LaMarcus Aldridge and the left block name a better duo
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"little selfish, but demar derozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Keldon Johnson, dame, chris Paul"

Lamarcus Aldridge and the Spurs first rounder this year for Vuc
"The year is ~~20XX~~ 2021. Lamarcus Aldridge is a point guard, and DeMar DeRozan is now a catch and shoot power forward."
"The year is ~~20XX~~ 2021. LaMarcus Aldridge is now a point guard, and DeMar DeRozan is a catch and shoot power forward."
"Not really, he signed Dwight Howard in Houston while letting him get a ton of post-ups and tried to get Lamarcus Aldridge too. He's about talent over everything else and makes everything around that work as best they can. Morey has said before he would post up Shaq every play if he had him on his team. He's not the weird die hard caricature everyone assumes."
That would be cool to see. Love me some LaMarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge
"I have no idea if it‚Äôs rational or not, but I‚Äôm terrified of Lamarcus Aldridge murdering us again"
"Underrated: John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMarcus Cousins, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Derrick Rose, especially if they missed out on pre-injury Rose  Russell Westbrook is so polarizing that he will remain stuck on a pendulum.  While I generally like Kyrie Irving, I think he has been and will remain overrated, despite being a very good player.   He's flashy and efficient, which works to his benefit, along with his undeniably, spectacular peformance in the 2016 Finals. As a star player though, he's produced a very little amount of sustained team success as a leader, away from three surefire Hall of Famers, one of which is considered the GOAT for a whole generation of fans (and, all three are among the greatest scorers/offensive talents the league has ever seen).  That's not really Kyrie's fault, but I don't think people in the future who didn't see will consider that aspect all that much."
Lamarcus Aldridge. I can guarantee no one will remember this man.
Lamarcus Aldridge is 35 and they have pretty similar games
Demar has been killing it this season with good playmaking and efficient shooting.  The problem is Lamarcus Aldridge being back.  Now go wash that slander out of your mouth.
"Disagree, Id reserve the hall of very good for guys like LaMarcus Aldridge, Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway, Blake Griffin, etc. Multiple time all stars who could lead their team to a playoff run"
Guys we‚Äôre in a thread about LaMarcus Aldridge and Demar Derozan. I know it‚Äôs dumb but you clearly know who they‚Äôre talking about
"that's bullshit, statistically. his minutes with the young guys are positive on/off. its aldridge tanking everyone else's on/off numbers. demar is a way better defender as a 4 than he was as a 2 or 3. he's strong as shit so he contests pretty well and isn't getting dusted by guards like he was. he's got like a 4.5 ast/to ratio, he's scoring at about 57% ts and getting better, he's got career high as/48. demar isn't a bad player. LaMarcus just doesn't try on defense anymore. he's killing everyone else's numbers. don't blame demar. lol"
"IDK, it seems to me like when he is fed the ball in the post he has a bad habit of just bricking LaMarcus Aldridge turnarounds.  He is a tantalizing player because he is so dominant on putbacks and increasingly (in this game at least) finishing lobs and stuff, but it just seems like he can't translate that physical dominance into an efficient post game. He's [101 in the league in Free Throw Rate](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ftr) at .264, which is pretty low for a center (Embiid is at .658). You do have more finesse / stretch type guys like Myles Turner (.252), Ibaka (.191), and Vucevic (.111) below that, but they all have much higher three-point attempt rates (.450, .301, .337) than Ayton (.047 (!) ).  I think maybe his handle and/or footwork are letting him down in the post, because he definitely shows the physicality in other parts of the game, but in iso he struggles to attack the rim and draw fouls."
"Depends **a lot** on his development imo.  Notice these games where he's dropping 40 on insane efficiency, he's cleaning up at the line and with jump-shots.  Prime Embiid should not be Lamarcus Aldridge, relying on jumpers to have a big game.  Until we see an Embiid that consistently dominates inside, there's no way I'm putting him over Giannis. Certainly has the talent though."
Lamarcus Aldridge
Sean Elliott really said LaMarcus Aldridge is ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù under 4 mins left of the 4th quarter
Well known sharpshooter Lamarcus Aldridge
Same draft class as LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy.
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"
"I can only name one player I would have taken over Dwight in the next 3 drafts after his. And that is Chris Paul. I would also argue Dwight had a higher peak than Paul even if his downslide came earlier. These drafts included  LaMarcus Aldridge Chris Paul Brandon Roy Rajon Rondo  I'll even cheat and go one year ahead even tho you never defined what an ""era"" even meant. KD is thr first player in 4 drafts I easily go ""yeah I'd take him over Dwight easy"". I hate to say you're talking out your ass but it kind of seems like you are."
Every time I check in on Ayton it seems like these are the problems with his game:  1. His role model is LaMarcus Aldridge 2. He thinks his turnaround jumper is as good as LaMarcus' 3. It is not
"It‚Äôs funny because Aldridge &amp; Demar (even back when he was on the raptors) were my secret favourite players to watch because I love the midrange. Watching Lamarcus nowadays is sad. He looks so slow, just getting abused on defence"
The LaMarcus Aldridge effect. Dude grabbed 3 rebounds lol
"Prime matchup for him. Went from playing Myles turner, Gasol, and AD to playing a LaMarcus Aldridge with cement feet."
i read that as BBQ and immediately thought Wiseman on Lamarcus Aldridge ü§£
[Zach Lowe](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2916862-warriors-trade-rumors-gs-wont-move-no-2-pick-for-lamarcus-aldridge-no-11)
"I don't think it would be someone quite as individually talented as Westbrook. They would have to clog up the lane on offense add nothing on defense, but also take up a lot of the cap so that the team can't surround them with better talent.   I'd go with someone like LaMarcus Aldridge."
"I have 1 gripe and 1 note.   Gripe: I think Jimmy Butler is better than Lamarcus Aldridge. If we are going by career of active players maybe. MAYBE. If we go by skill level right now, Jimmy B  Note: I only noticed 1 state that had an Active player that could overshadow the best player. Illinois. AD has a way to go but he could pass DWade for sure. That is really saying something."
[Found it :] (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-absurd-tony-parker-assist-leads-to-lamarcus-aldridge-3-pointer/)
Idk about LaMarcus Aldridge over Jimmy Butler for Texas
"LaMarcus Aldridge over Jimmy Butler is an interesting call. I might just be a victim of recency bias, but I think much more highly of JB."
"LaMarcus Aldridge, larry nance, latrell sprewell probably"
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he‚Äôs back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he‚Äôll bounce back soon enough"
He has unfinished business in Portland. https://sports.yahoo.com/lamarcus-aldridge-keep-telling-damian-140055526.html
"For a while, warriors fans pretended like Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge were dirty players in an obvious attempt to make it seem like what Zaza did wasn't dirty."
Vucevic  LaMarcus Aldridge
Statistically it's Chris Paul and it isn't even close. By eye test it's either Chris Paul or Steve Nash. LaMarcus Aldridge and Vince Carter are distant contenders as well. Basically almost every all-time great has made the finals at least once at some point in their career.
I think prime Lamarcus Aldridge is close to my favourite. That high arcing mid range shot that you feel is gonna go in every time
Celtics fans can I offer you 1 Lamarcus Aldridge in this trying time
You think the Spurs are gonna buy out LaMarcus Aldridge?
Lamarcus Aldridge is done done.
"I love LaMarcus Aldridge, he‚Äôs the biggest FA signing of our franchise, put up numbers for us early in his stint here, was a professional with the nephew situation and still carried us to the playoffs, but unfortunately he looks to be in the twilight of his career now. I was expecting him to play better this year since he‚Äôs on a contract year but at age 36 most players really start to decline. His perimeter D is non existent, and although he‚Äôs taking a higher volume of 3‚Äôs the results weren‚Äôt what we were expecting. So many spurs fans are reactionary and call him ‚Äúwashed‚Äù, ‚Äúcorpse‚Äù, etc. and while I understand the premise I find it so disrespectful considering everything else he‚Äôs done for us. Wish we traded him at last years deadline when he had some value, but this was going to happen eventually. Jakob is going to have to get to Tiago Splitter level if we want a chance at the playoffs. I‚Äôm not asking for much but just a passable big to cheese us through the rest of the season. In the meantime I‚Äôll be praying for a John Collins overpay Max deal next summer"
"LaMarcus Aldridge bruh, send the rookie to the bench."
LaMarcus Aldridge
Lamarcus Aldridge might be available. Not sure what asset the Nets has that the Spurs might want though
"Maybe the Spurs buyout Lamarcus Aldridge if nobody trades for him, he's 35 and I think the Spurs would want to start rebuilding once Derozan/LMA are gone."
"When was the last time we actually had cap space to do anything notable? Last I remember would be 2015 where we tried to get LaMarcus Aldridge, and he declined. Though did note since that it was a good meeting at the time.   We'll see this off season whether or not any players will want to come here. I just think players are more likely to commit if they know they can be competitive and play a bigger role. Its way less likely they'll do so if its a losing situation.   I also look at the Brogdon move for the Pacers a few years ago, and how that was just your basic sign and trade turned to gold. Theres other names out there who could be had at a reasonable cost."
"maybe Lamarcus Aldridge if the Spurs aren't able to flip him by the deadline, idk if they're trying to rebuild or not at this point. He's like 35 so I don't think the Spurs should re-sign him either. Maybe Drummond as well."
"I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say Aldridge is a bad player overall at this point- but what he does well at this stage doesn‚Äôt really add much to them, and what he does poorly would be disastrous for them as a team.   I thought bryn Forbes was the biggest net negative defender I had ever seen. Then 2021 Lamarcus Aldridge happened. He is the target of the opposition every possession, too slow to guard the pick and roll, too flat footed to protect the rim, too slow to react to guard the perimeter against shooting bigs.   He might give you 20. He might score 30 if he‚Äôs really hot. But he‚Äôs going to give it back on the other end and then some."

LaMarcus Aldridge.   Screw that dude and his unguardable long 2s
Because Lebron is a consensus top 3 player of all time (top 2 possibly even number one for me) while Harden is at best lower end top 30.  It's like saying why Lamarcus Aldridge doesn't get the same scrutiny as Karl Malone
The Spurs front office showed their incompetence by refusing to trade him when he actually had value. Now they are stuck with an albatross Lamarcus Aldridge on one of the worst contracts in the league.
"Jakob has basically been the same player since the 2018 season. He managed to get worse at free throws and grow more passive on offense over the offseason though. I said after the bubble the most I would want to pay him was 8M/year and we ended up paying a little more than that. I think LaMarcus is definitely better than Jakob and Eubanks.  Aldridge fits terribly on defense with our team because we have DeRozan who can't guard guards well, Mills who gets destroyed by physical guards, and Dejounte gets pushed around by most players that aren't point guards and we're missing White who is definitely our best defender. That wouldn't be a huge deal if we had someone like Draymond to help him at the 4 but we basically mostly play DeMar/Keldon and Gay at 4 and none of them are going to provide substantial help to Aldridge defensively."
LaMarcus Aldridge gonna run off the wrong direction with the ball soon
"I mean, that's a bit of difference between AD, arguably, for me yes, the best defender in the league, and LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE."
"Keldon ""LeBron James"" Johnson and LaMarcus ""6'10 JR Smith"" Aldridge"
If you have one great move that can't be stopped it's better than having multiple moves that are good but not great  Would u take LaMarcus Aldridge over Shaq
Lamarcus Aldridge has personally given up 5 3s. He‚Äôs got no defense for bigs who can shoot. Spurs might want to go small unless cousins is in.
"Joe Johnson, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Jamal Crawford, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul George, Rajon Rondo, Joakim Noah, Kyle Lowry, Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Derrick Rose, Draymond Green"
"He will, but personally I think Lowry should be the metric to getting into the HOF. He's a great player, and underrated by the casual fan, and this is nothing against Lowry, it's more so a qualm I have with the HOF.   As it stands right now the Basketball HOF is way too easy to get into, and other sports HOF, like the baseball HOF is way too hard. IMO Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love are a good litmus test. If you had a better career than those 3 you should make the HOF. It's just kind of weird, we have a HOF that immortalizes players for their transcendent talent and impact they had on the game, and we have 5-6x All Stars in their alongside Michael Jordan."
"Yeah, he has lol the only two players worse than him are Marvin Bagley and LaMarcus Aldridge.  True, the dubs games I've watched he's seemed calm and collected, though it was closer to the start of the year."
"&gt; State income tax is a major factor though  I see this thought on reddit pretty frequently and I don't know why. The only person in recent memory that I can remember moving from a high state income tax to a low state income tax area is LaMarcus Aldridge and even then, he's from Texas and there were pretty clear basketball reasons to want to go from Portland to SA, no offense to Blazers fans."
Lamarcus Aldridge because it has Marc Gasol in the middle of it
"The other guy is being nostalgic that not only was he putting near these current numbers, he was also set to be even better (DOUBT).   Hayward did garner a good amount of UFA attention but I'd liken him to maybe a LaMarcus Aldridge level free agent. Very few franchises looked at him and saw a game-changer.   His joked about nickname was White LeBron but he was significantly far away from that. Even if he was able to consistently average 25-5-5, that's still just an All-Star. And again that was a leap that he did not actually ever make, nor did that many people really expect him to."
"Because there are lots of players who genuinely don't give a fuck about what fans say and enjoy their 100+ million earnings. Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Harden, Anthony Davis (who went through actual hell with the pelicans) are all examples of this. There are really only a select few players that can't get off social media and filter out the noise; generational wealth and thick skin has a tendency to do that.  KD, Kyrie, Lebron at times, Wall, Jordan back in the day, are the exceptions, not the rule."
"I'll give you LaMarcus Aldridge, Luka Samanic, and a 2nd for him if you want lmao"
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"People always been on about the free throw differential but its not the point this game  Watch the game over again and tell me that Dejounte Murray, Lamarcus Aldridge and Patty Mills weren't fouled more often then what they got? A combined 2 FTs between the 3. The refs refused to give it both ways this game."
Lamarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge I guess
I think Lamarcus Aldridge
If thats not a long time veteran in Aldridge maybe they bite even a little on the drive. LaMarcus played it well and stuck to KAT.
G: Dejounte Murray  G: Lonnie Walker  F: Keldon Johnson  F: DeMar DeRozan  C: Lamarcus Aldridge
"Yes, Lakers played a spurs team twice without LaMarcus Aldridge.  The 7 games i'm speaking involve   Timberwolves 1 (No Kat)  Bulls 1  Spurs 3 (No Aldridge)  Grizzles 2 (No ja Morant)  By definition these teams are terrible with no all star forward with the exception of DeRozan, but DeRozan still shot 50% against the lakers..."
PRO BOWL CORNERBACK LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE
"Basketball Reference has Jimmy at a 43% chance right now, or 20th among active players. I'm not sure how accurate the model is, but it's interesting. It has Lamarcus Aldridge as 50%, the definition of a coinflip right now. I think this model underrates Klay Thompson- If you just looked at a guy on paper with his career resume then maybe it's reasonable, but in reality I think there's 0% chance Klay doesn't get in.

No LaMarcus Aldridge slander tonight!
#LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE
Rudy is super tall with long arms for how mobile he is even at his current age. I'm still mad we never got to see a Dejounte Murray - Danny Green - Kawhi Leonard - Rudy Gay - LaMarcus Aldridge lineup
Lamarcus Aldridge went from 2nd best player on the Spurs to being legit ass
"Lamarcus Aldridge has finally hit the age wall and he hit it like a brick wall, dude just looks lost on defense and moves like a brick now, his shooting isn‚Äôt great rn either and he can‚Äôt gets boards, it‚Äôs hard to watch honestly, really wish we moved him when we had the chance"
"I mean, no one calls LaMarcus Aldridge ""Marcus""   Just add the La- to stop people from being confused"
"PF-Centers that come to mind, whether starting at one and transitioning to the other at different stages of career/roster/or even mid-game: Channing Frye, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Paul Millsap, Domantas Sabonis,  LaMarcus Aldridge, even Giannis plays a fair bit at 4/5...Porzingis as well has that flexibility.   Are PFs really getting smaller/faster/more skilled more so than any other position, or is that just happening more pronouncedly at the 4/5, where there was the most room for improvement? It'd probably be fairer to say there has just been an overall blurring of the lines between roles rather than focusing on just the meta changes at the PF"
"With the comment I responded to that implied IT didn't recover well from the hip injury because he was old and undersized, I was being sarcastic and saying the opposite should then be true for Killian - young and not undersized so he'll recover really well. My bad for not being serious in what was a serious conversation.  If you want to talk about it though, we can.  I like to look at past/current players that have suffered the same injury, but it's hard because there's no truly comprehensive list of players that had this same injury. A redditor made a list and posted a few years ago (same era as IT going through his hip troubles) and the best case was Lamarcus Aldridge and depending on how you value him post injury, Wilson Chandler. The other players pretty much flamed out. And again I'm not sure how complete that list is. With Killian though he's super young so he has that on his side. Also, every case is different. People recover from ACL tears differently, achilles tendon ruptures, shoulder surgeries, you get the idea."
"Yeah, LaMarcus Aldridge is clearly that piece (please)"
"Big list, but...  &amp;#x200B;  **Victor Oladipo**  HOU  **PJ Tucker**  HOU  **Eric Gordon**  CHA  **Richaun Holmes**  SAS  **Nemanja Bjelica**  SAC  **George Hill**  LAC, if they have enough cap space  **Al Horford**  Stays or is released.  Bad contract  **JJ Redick**  Whoever needs shooting.  MKE or LAL probibly, maybe back to Philly  **Nikola Vucevic**  Hornets?  Maybe Celtics  **Evan Fournier**  Stays in ORL  **Terrence Ross**  Warriors or Hornets  **John Collins**  Depends.  Likely ether traded to WSH for Beal or SAS for DeRozan, maybe HOU for Olidipo  **Larry Nance**  CLE  **Kyle Lowry**  Clippers is a nice fit, but no cap space.  If he is traded, I could see NYK or DAL  **Lamarcus Aldridge**  Terrible contract.  That being said, NYK or buyout"
"‚ÄúAccording to Shams Charania of The Athletic, the Spurs are taking calls on LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Trey Lyles and Patty Mills ahead of the March 25 trade deadline.‚Äù"
"Yeah people acting like oh it's only happened once, no biggie. By far the spurs biggest free agency signing ever is LaMarcus Aldridge. Who have the jazz ever gotten in free agency? The mavs? There are several well run teams that rarely if ever get big free agents that have been historically run better than most teams."
He was low all-NBA caliber and that's how people recognized him - on the verge of being elite. The kind of guy that could lead a team to the playoffs but not deep.  I'd say a good comparison for his place in the pecking order was like... LaMarcus Aldridge in Portland.
"When I lived in Tualatin, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, Darius Miles, Travis Outlaw, and Raef LaFrentz were all neighbors at one point. Used to see Steve Blake, Joel Pzrybilla, Brian Grant, and Mo Williams out at stores. Fairly common to bump into a Blazer back then. My youngest daughter has a picture with LaMarcus Aldridge in the local Fred Meyer. She was wearing a red LMA jersey and he asked if she wanted a photo, we didn‚Äôt ask him."
"The worst thing LeBron ever did was not commit to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Had he done so instead of sign one or two year contracts, we would have had the promise of some stability when recruiting free agents and coaches. Instead, the best we could ever do before 2015 was sign guys like Larry Hughes and Mo Williams. Had he stuck to his guns and said we‚Äôre playing for MY team, Dwyane Wade and either Bosh or Chris Paul would have joined instead of them going to miami and we sleepwalk the East for the next 15 years. The biggest question mark is whether we draft Kyrie Irving with the Clippers‚Äô number one overall in 2011 and with Chris Paul and D Wade I don‚Äôt know that we do. At that point was the fo smart enough to avoid the mine field that separated 2 and 9? Best case scenario we draft Valanciunas as the heir apparent to Z but could have very well ended up with Derrick Williams, Enes Kanter, Jan Vesely, or Brandon Knight. On the other hand, maybe we look to add a sharp-shooting backup 2 guard with great defense and championship pedigree in Klay Thompson. Another question is whether David Griffen takes over the GM role? He made some brilliant moves that played a big part in our championship but would we have had a player like Kevin Love in 2015? Would his partnership with AD have started years earlier? Would peak Boogie Cousins or Lamarcus Aldridge have joined up? Would a real coach have come to Cleveland instead of the clown car of HCs we have had?  Safe to say he would have rings. Possible he would enjoy two long spells of consecutive championships broken up by a bad matchup here or there or its not outside the realm of possibility he wins a dozen or more rings"
LaMarcus Aldridge incoming.
I know you asked for a ‚Äògood‚Äô big man but will you manage one LaMarcus Aldridge. He can be solid... sometimes. Is there anyway the salaries work?
"I don't hate him, I just don't romanticize him like it's 2017. I love Lamarcus Aldridge, but it's not because he's an all-NBA player anymore."
7 time all star LaMarcus Aldridge
Lamarcus Aldridge did this a crap ton
"Lamarcus aldridge is now a bench big Danny   2018 wasn't that long ago, Danny. Do it, Danny."
"It‚Äôs been apparent since the bubble that Jakob Poeltl is an upgrade over Lamarcus Aldridge   There‚Äôs more factors at play, sure. Patty is a lightning bolt off the bench. Rudy is solid on both ends, DV looks to be the next glue guy all basketball nerds love. Dejounte is really good and has gotten better as the year has progressed.   But it really comes down to Jakob anchoring the defense with capable perimeter defenders around him."
PG: Damian Lillard  SG: Brandon Roy  SF: Clyde Drexler  PF: LaMarcus Aldridge  C: Bill Walton
I‚Äôll give you a slightly used LaMarcus Aldridge and some breakfast burrito coupons
"The basketball hall of fame is easy af to get into. Like, fucking Lamarcus Aldridge will probably get in. It's a joke compared to the NFL."
"LaMarcus Aldridge. 51st all-time in points. Solid 1000 game career.  Shame how he's looked awful this year, but he spent almost a decade at 20 and 9.   Was a good second option to Kawhi when they won a ring, and started all 16 games and led the team in playoff minutes.  And the Raptors could've drafted him instead of Bargnani. And I will never not follow Aldridge's career."
"Yeah, man. Lamarcus Aldridge is totally known for being a top 5 defender in NBA history while also having guard skills as a near 7 footer and being the primary playmaker on his team. You figured it out."
"LaMarcus Aldridge is not comparable to Prime KG, the only reason to think that is if you flat out ignore defense and playmaking."
I think you just named LaMarcus Aldridge dude
Tyrus Thomas for LaMarcus Aldridge
Totally agree. Don't be Lamarcus Aldridge. Be Tim Duncan
"I love this dunk, but I don't get slandering the individual who got postered. I see too many people jump out of the way and not challenge the driver, giving a free lane up. When i'm coaching id much rather have my players get postered than pussy away from the challenge like a real Lamarcus Aldridge"
"Players to do it in order from oldest to most recent are Joe Barry Carroll, David Robinson, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Dirk, Anthony Davis, Anthony Davis, LaMarcus Aldridge, Embiid"
He's the first player since LaMarcus Aldridge on the first of January 2019 to score 50 points and block 4 shots.
"- Offer Harris for Myles Turner and pray the Pacers accept it, throw in Shamet to sweeten the deal  - Not an elite rim protector, but Lamarcus Aldridge is at least a big body they can throw in the paint and can be got for Harris + filler  - Bucks fans have been wanting to trade Brook Lopez, it‚Äôs possible they can make a run at him  - Also not elite, but a deal with Steven Adams might benefit both teams  Just to spitball a few names. I may have exaggerated the amount of true elite rim protectors on the market, but they definitely need a big body when their main competition in the east are Embiid and Giannis"
LaMarcus Aldridge and Tim Duncan would like a word.   Edit: forgot about Bosh but he was an offensive beast too
Yes! Him and LaMarcus Aldridge. Dude turns into a sharpshooter.
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
"&gt; Dude's had exactly ONE teammate make an all-star game (Lamarcus Aldridge way back in the day) and yet he makes the playoffs every single year, even taking a team to the conference finals.  The mind-blowing thing is that Dame has only missed the playoffs in his rookie season. LeBron by contrast has missed it thrice (his first two seasons with Cleveland, and his injured first season with the Lakers)."
"I think Blazers fans are just tired of feeling like our guy is always underrated. I mean c'mon, name a player better than Damian Lillard who's never started a single All-Star game.   Dude's had exactly ONE teammate make an all-star game (Lamarcus Aldridge way back in the day) and yet he makes the playoffs every single year, even taking a team to the conference finals. Dude is pretty legit, but every time there's a ""well....this award could go to either player"" type situation, its pretty much never Dame.   Realistically though, there are probably just far fewer people watching Blazers games than just about any team in the league."
"Rim protection he gets like a 2   General mobility and one on one situations he isn‚Äôt bad and I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs even above average compared to others at his position  Overall 5-6 out of 10, average. He‚Äôs not Jakob Poeltl but he‚Äôs also not Lamarcus Aldridge."
"Honest question, Blazers fans. If Oden could stay healthy and play at his best, or if LaMarcus Aldridge stayed with Portland and played at his best, do you think they would be even better than Brandon Roy at his best?"
Damian Lillard/Brandon Roy/Clyde Drexler/LaMarcus Aldridge/Arvydas Sabonis
"well I'll tell ya LaMarcus Aldridge, outside of hitting damn near every pick n pop 2, has not been good. lol last year he actually wasn't that awful around the rim but now he's maybe the worst defensive center in the NBA. in comparison with Jakob Poetl, we go from like 102 defensive rating which would lead the NBA with Jakob to 118 or so with Aldridge in. its tough. lol"
**70 points or higher** * Devin Booker - 70pts **60 points or higher** * Carmelo Anthony - 62pts * Steph Curry - 62pts * James Harden - 61pts * Lebron James - 61pts * Damian Lillard - 61pts * Bradley Beal - 60pts * Klay Thompson - 60pts * Kemba Walker - 60pts **50 points or higher** * Russell Westbrook - 58pts * Kyrie Irving - 57pts * LaMarcus Aldridge - 56pts * DeMarcus Cousins - 56pts * Kevin Durant - 54pts * Fred Vanvleet - 54pts * Jimmy Butler - 53pts * Anthony Davis - 53pts * TJ Warren - 53pts * Giannis Antetokounmpo - 52pts * DeMar DeRozan - 52pts * D'Angelo Russell - 52pts * Isaiah Thomas - 52pts * John Wall - 52pts * Caris LeVert - 51pts * Kevin Love - 51pts * Khris Middleton - 51pts * Terrence Ross - 51pts * Eric Gordon - 50pts * Blake Griffin - 50pts * Nikola Jokic - 50pts * CJ McCollum - 50pts * Derrick Rose - 50pts * Lou Williams - 50pts * Trae Young - 50pts
"LaMarcus Aldridge also has 5 All NBA teams, as does Paul George and Blake Griffin, would you also include them?"
"Which isn't helping them win games now and is a total crapshoot that expires in one year.  If they end up with the corpse of Lamarcus Aldridge instead of a Harrison Barnes or Eric Gordon, they'll regret it."
"Pains me to say it but it‚Äôs probably lamarcus Aldridge. Still is pretty solid offensively but he‚Äôs not the same athletically and you can tell. Advanced stats are even worse on Lonnie walker I think, but the benefit of youth I‚Äôd rather keep him"
"Agreed...Giannis mostly plays like a wing, slashing, cutting, distributing. Admiral played like a traditional big with a great face up game. They're stylistically different players.    I think Admiral lacks a good current comp. Lamarcus Aldridge has a similar finesse game, but is lacking the explosive physical part. I think he'd play like a mash up of Towns + LMA if he came up now. Regardless, he'd be destructive in the league today."
may i intrigue u in a lamarcus aldridge   he shoots he scores alot n very good with other bigs
"Fair enough, but the narrative is that we get a ton of free agents and that's not the case. We couldn't even get a meeting with KD, LaMarcus Aldridge had to come back twice because we fucked up the first time    We had to have a do over with LMA.   LMA."
Pj Tucker and Lamarcus Aldridge also attended Texas
wanna a slightly used lamarcus aldridge
The much anticipated Blake Griffin vs Lamarcus Aldridge matchup must wait
"the issue with the demar number there is that he played so much with LaMarcus this year. his on/off without LaMarcus is positive, if that shows you just how bad Aldridge has been. Jakob jumps off the screen to me in the same way Gobert does, you just see the offense getting scared over time. his defense is genuinely unreal.  as for the bench mob, Patty has no exaggeration been a star in his minutes. Rudy has been a monster defensively and as hit or miss as his BBIQ can be, he's still draining ridiculous contested shots when no one else can get anything going to keep us afloat. Vassell is one of the most naturally gifted defenders I've ever seen and he's going to be an absolute fucking menace in the future.  he has awesome defensive stats but the best stuff he does is shutting down off-ball actions constantly like he's clairvoyant.   I'm really enjoying the success for this team even though I wanted to #FADEFORCADE and trade all the old guys."
"Yeah I you hit the nail on the head, their defence has been much better. They're up to 9th this season for DRTG after being 25th last season.      |||||+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|OnCourt|On-OffV| |1|Jakob Poeltl|26|564|+10.9|+21.1| |2|Rudy Gay|25|552|+9.7|+18.8| |3|Patty Mills|26|661|+7.9|+18.3| |4|Derrick White|7|162|+9.1|+11.2| |5|Devin Vassell|25|444|+4.9|+8.7| |6|Dejounte Murray|26|789|+1.2|+5.0| |7|DeMar DeRozan|24|800|-1.8|-3.1| |9|LaMarcus Aldridge|18|480|-8.2|-12.0| |10|Trey Lyles|14|165|-14.2|-15.5| |11|Keldon Johnson|26|781|-6.8|-16.0| |12|Lonnie Walker|24|647|-8.5|-16.0| |13|Drew Eubanks|10|132|-20.5|-22.2|    Based on these On-Off per 100 possession numbers it seems that the Spurs' success has also been driven more so from their deep bench and role players compared to their veteran starts."
MY TURN: Lamarcus Aldridge
"They also listed Duncan as a C during our Beautiful Game years when he was definitely our PF when starting alongside Splitter (he would slot up to C when Diaw was in, but Diaw didn‚Äôt start for us until the Finals). It contributes to the notion that Duncan was a C after Robinson retired even though he played alongside guys like Rasho Nesterovic, Nazr Mohammed, Fabricio Oberto, Francisco Elson, Kurt Thomas, and Splitter after Robinson retired.   The only two players he started alongside post-03 that would have him definitively play as the team‚Äôs center were DeJuan Blair, Matt Bonner and LaMarcus Aldridge."
"I think with Aldridge being out we have some addition by subtraction too. I love Aldridge and want him to get healthy, but he and DeRozan have never been a good fit together.  With Poetl in the starting lineup, I think we're getting the rim protection that we need (we were bleeding lots of points with the starters before Aldridge went out)  This year Aldridge has changed his game to space the floor more and isn't doing the 'roll' part of pick and roll a lot, so it frees up DeMar to work more in the midrange, but I'd really like to see LaMarcus go to town on bench units."
You can have Lamarcus Aldridge.
"No stars (unless they give an absolute haul of picks), but could get an Aaron Gordon/Lamarcus Aldridge type. Could maybe go balls to the walls and grab Vooch? Would definitely be far more expensive"
LaMarcus Aldridge is a good one
"The David West move was ""unfair"". I thought he could have got a big contract somewhere else.  It's the same situation than may be LaMarcus Aldridge. If he goes next year to Milwaukee, Lakers, Philly, Utah... For the minimum... It would be an steal.  Then, the revenant, Livingston, giving quality minutes...  Those 2 were lit from the midrange"
"Depending on both what you would consider his prime, and what a star is, you could say there were three (not directly related to injury) careers that rose and fell.  - Al Horford - OJ Mayo - LaMarcus Aldridge  For players with injury histories, there are some notable names.  - Brandon Roy - Blake Griffin - Derrick Rose"
"My only guess is because LaMarcus Aldridge was out but that actually makes us better against a team like Atlanta so yea, easy money. Congrats"
Can we interest you in one Lamarcus Aldridge? We don‚Äôt even need Collins you can have him for free
"Lamarcus Aldridge and ""you know"""
"Embiid, Jokic, KAT, Gobert, Bam, Porzingis, Nurkic, Vucevic, Ayton, Jonas, Wood, Allen, Capela, Adams, BroLo, Turner, Drummond make 17. Then arguably Thomas Bryant, Dan Theis, Mitchell Robinson, and LaMarcus Aldridge."
for players that the Nets may target?  * Javale McGee * Nerlens * PJ Tucker * LaMarcus Aldridge (longshot) * Blake Griffin (prob won't opt out) * Gorgui Dieng * Robin Lopez (most likely)
you have to think what the wolves want for their best player since garnett  they surely dont want lamarcus aldridge and other shit
"I honestly don't know right now. For us to get much for him, a team would need to believe he can get back to where he was pre-injury. We also have the TPE, but if we're trading Kemba or the TPE, it would preferably be for a player who'll be on contract for at least 2 years.  I was intrigued by a potential DeMar Derozan and Lamarcus Aldridge for Kemba, the TPE, and a pick, but I don't think the Spurs are bad enough right now to want to haul those contracts off, and they're only for one year. This team desperately needs veterans that can still play minutes, right now we have none besides Kemba."
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"Russ has a billion all-star appearances, a couple NBA first teams, and an MVP....he‚Äôs a lock  Kyrie will get in off his all-star appearances and that 2016 ring + the rest of career  they both surpassed the bare minimum requirements....Lamarcus Aldridge will be a HOFer...so will they"
"Lamarcus F‚ÄôN Aldridge , the most underrated all star of his era. Mr reliable for years straight stats wise ."
LaMarcus Aldridge is getting in.
How would you like 7x All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge? üëÄ
Omg that‚Äôs LaMarcus Aldridge or Evan Fournier music
"Damn, Lamarcus Aldridge was the real MVP!"
"We have 4!!! Harden, kyrie, Kd, dinwiddie when he's back. 5 if you could Lamarcus aldridge."
I couldn't remember the details so I looked it up. Looks like this is what happened lol:  &gt;...apparently upset over a non-call on the¬†Nuggets'¬†Paul Millsap. Millsap was defending¬†LaMarcus Aldridge¬†in the post. Aldridge turned around for a short jumper with Millsap in his face and missed the attempt. Popovich shot out of his chair on the bench complaining then called a timeout and continued to protest the non-call to official Mark Ayotte. Popovich was hit with two technical fouls and shown the door for the fastest ejection this season...
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
"Who cares if the washed out LaMarcus Aldridge can come in and score 22pts, he has no defense. Did you see how Steven Adams dropped 40pts on his ass?    /s"
You're forgetting LaMarcus Aldridge.
Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge combine for 32 on 75% shooting: deepest team of all time
"Anyone who thought that Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge who were starters this season, and very recently All Stars would make no impact on the Nets as second string guys they got for free is an idiot."
"Blake Griffin and lamarcus aldridge are not currently stars, are you okay?"
Imagine getting dicked on by Lamarcus Aldridge in 2021.
LaMarcus Aldridge might be unplayable against better playoff teams. Harden and Irving aren't getting over any screens and Aldridge can't do anything but drop. Imagine just giving up open 18 footers to Kawhi Leonard or Khris Middleton

"Iggy wanted to be RELEASED not traded so he could get every cent of his contact AND choose where else to go ring chase. And to try to force the situation,  and be just that bit more petty and c unprofessional, he wouldn't even show up for any team related activity,  let alone playing in a game for the Grizz.  Memphis was within its rights to suspend and finds him for not honoring his contract,  but being a small market team they didn't want to damage their reputation with agents and players, so they let Iggy play hooky for the year. I'm glad though that at least they stick to their principle of not just waiving him like he wanted.   If you are an over the hill ring chaser, at least work out a buyout like Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge, but Igoudala was way too greedy to do even that."
"He was a very good player, sure, but if the Nets are feeding Aldridge it's taking away shots from KD and Harden. He adds very little defensively, and he would be matched up against arguably the 2nd or 3rd best PF of all time in Karl Malone.   If you went KD at the 4 and brought LaMarcus off the bench then he's still getting matched up against prime Horace Grant, who was a 4x NBA champ, 4x All-Defense, and averaged 15/11 himself. It's probably a wash."
All this to stop a 35yo LaMarcus Aldridge
"Ben Mclemore is as useful is not more useful than Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge right now, where the outrage over this move?"
Toon LeBron lookin like LaMarcus Aldridge
"You‚Äôre right to ask that, I can‚Äôt think of many times where a big name joined a small market team for the first time (re-signing and Bron‚Äôs return don‚Äôt count).   I guess Lamarcus Aldridge to the Spurs?"
"Superstar is pushing it, but LaMarcus Aldridge remains the biggest free agent signing in Spurs history."
"In some cases, they own a home where they plan to retire and live there in the off season while renting in season at their team's city. For example, Lamarcus Aldridge lives in the Dallas suburbs (he's from here) and the neighborhood he lives in is filled with ex-players (mostly NFL and a few NBAer).."
"It's not a one off when the only teams other than San Antonio with Lamarcus Aldridge to get a star free agent over the last decade have been LA, New York and Miami with the exception of Lebron in Cleveland for very specific reasons. It's new in terms of those franchises being well run when they weren't in the past but the location is still the thing. If the Nets were in about 20-25 other cities they don't get them that's the point. They did a good job but some Nets fans act like it's some special front office and every other one just wasn't good enough otherwise they would have gotten them."
Yeah of course just that if Utah or Indiana or any number of other teams had done the same they wouldn't have gotten them. It's not like it's just automatic be in New York and get stars but every Lamarcus Aldridge is the only star free agent that didn't go to a free agent destination in the last decade.
"I remember when Lamarcus Aldridge signed with them that offseason thinking that they just fucked the league.  The league was fucked but, well, due to a different team."
Eddy Curry was good enough to be turned into LaMarcus Aldridge and Joakim Noah. He‚Äôs the GOAT.
However the Nets have automatically won the championship after signing 35yo LaMarcus Aldridge according to this sub.
Let's forgive Meyers Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Lamarcus Aldridge is a bitch, he literally left Portland because he was jealous of the  shine Dame was getting and if he had stayed they may not have won a chip by now but they‚Äôd be even closer than they are now which is pretty fucking close."
"I don't think it was as insidious as that, though it's possible. Jim had given himself a self-imposed timetable to ""make the Lakers contenders again"" and he was heading into his final year of that timeframe. The previous years he'd tried to sign big stars (Melo, LeBron, LaMarcus Aldridge) and had always struck out, so I think instead he decided to blow all his cap space on anyone they could get. After all, Jim still has an ownership stake in the Lakers, and following those signings he tried to wrestle control of the Lakers away from Jeanie, but it blew up in his face. Pelinka wasn't even in the picture at that point. Tanking the value of the Lakers would hurt his bottom line as much as Jeanie's as they are equal co-trustees."
Cartoon Lebron looks more like LaMarcus Aldridge.
Well known NBA superstar Lamarcus Aldridge
"Right now as a Blazers fan I root against Lamarcus Aldridge.     Left us because he was worried about being the star.  Him signing with Brooklyn, like Griffin makes me mad because its clear these players dont give their all unless they get something out of it."
Embiid would have to go for 40+ against DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge 4/7 times
"Imagine thinking that having injured Wade &amp; Bosh then Kyrie &amp; Love is anyway comparable to having Steph, Klay &amp; Draymond then Harden &amp; Kyrie as well as a still effective LaMarcus Aldridge &amp; Blake Griffin as 4th &amp; 5th options."
"When LeBron went to the tune planet or whatever, I legitimately thought it was LaMarcus Aldridge and that he was already there as a reject."
"I mean it comes down to the players. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Lamarcus Aldridge is a stronger lineup than any 5 the Lakers can put out there."
Does TuneBron look like Lamarcus Aldridge to anyone else?
LaMarcus has been out of shape and fat for like 5 years. Giannis is listed at 245. Anyone who thinks Aldridge and Giannis are the same weight is crazy.
"I've seen LaMarcus Aldridge described this way, too, at least when he was with the Spurs."
Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge   But seriously probably Kawhi. He needs less playmaking responsibilities and less offensive requirements. He should just go all out defensively and play good team ball.
"So this is the old Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson defense. Just like last year it was the LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes defense. The its not me its them defense.   I'd like to think Spurs fans are smart enough to figure out the common denominator here but perhaps I give too much credit."
is lamarcus aldridge one of the unwashed kings?
"&gt; The Athletic‚Äôs NBA insider Shams Charania reported Aldridge gave back $7.25 million of his remaining deal, which allows San Antonio to possibly add another player to its roster and stay under the luxury tax line.  https://www.ksat.com/sports/2021/03/25/nba-trade-deadline-tracker-latest-lamarcus-aldridge-demar-derozan-and-other-spurs-trade-rumors/  I don‚Äôt know exactly how many games he had left, but that‚Äôs over half the salary he was still owed.  And let‚Äôs them dip under the Lux and sign someone else."
LaMarcus ‚ÄúPaul McCartney‚Äù Aldridge
"Lakers fans the type to be cool with keeping THT over Lowry, but then cry when LaMarcus Aldridge scores 11 points lmao."
"LaMarcus ""I will beat Stockton's 28 assists"" Aldridge"
Lamarcus ‚ÄúUnwashed‚Äù Aldridge
"You‚Äôre telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You‚Äôre out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don‚Äôt have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
Is that Lamarcus Aldridge or Jokic?
Lamarcus Aldridge would have been nice.
LaMarcus Aldridge is a +26 in 21 minutes for the Nets so far. He's also on a triple-double watch
"LaMarcus ""John Stockton"" Aldridge"
He thinks doubling a 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge will eventually get good results. I hope no one else does that mistake
"People are fucking insane if they think LaMarcus Aldridge can't contribute. He was averaging 19 and 7 last year on decent efficiency and even had games this year where he was putting up 25+ points in games. His defense is obviously not gonna be great, nobody on the nets is really that great on defense, but this is the greatest offensive roster ever constructed imo.   What a fucking steal for the Nets, most stacked roster I've ever seen."
LaMarcus Aldridge looking great with the Nets.
Lmao LaMarcus Aldridge
Lamarcus aldridge and KD
This argument is so annoying. Who cares what washed up players do and what team they go to? Why do we care that 35 year old Lamarcus Aldridge and the Spurs mutually chose to part ways so he could spend one of his few remaining years playing for something?
LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin
Now the bad news: LaMarcus Aldridge is available to play for the Brooklyn Nets
GUYS PRIME LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE IS BACK HOLY FUCK THE NETS ARE A SUPER TEAM THIS IS SO UNFAIR THE BUYOUT MARKET IS RUINING THE LEAGUE HOLY FUCK
Lamarcus aldridge will do something and it will get 5000 upvotes
"Some washed up old glory. Take Lamarcus Aldridge. He‚Äôs now worse than most names in this thread (wiggings, kuzma) and is coming out of a $24M / year contract. If he had signed another one or two year contract for the same number (or even larger) it would have been an incredible overpay, but nobody would ever think to investigate it."
But somehow 36 year old lamarcus Aldridge is lmao
"Imagine if the Nets do not win the title this year with Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc (assuming they're all playing). It would be an absolute embarrassment.   I'm honestly rooting for them to choke to see the backlash."
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
Blake and LMA aren‚Äôt as bad at defense as you are suggesting. Also on weak teams.   Keep saying you‚Äôd be overjoyed to let LaMarcus Aldridge take shots all you want. You just look stupid.
LaMarcus Aldridge is washed. Westbrook is no longer in his prime but still a good player that can has off games.
"For me superstar requires a bit of longevity, it needs to be a title earned over multiple seasons of incredible basketball play.   From that perspective, it is somewhat debatable if Blake was ever a superstar. He certainly had a few seasons of great basketball, but he was never first team all-nba even at his best.  I would say he was borderline, he's closer to LaMarcus Aldridge or Lillard in terms of career, than Leonard, Davis, Harden or Curry"
"These are the connections cause you‚Äôre kinda stretching it   KD-Thunder and Warriors, his longtime rival  Kyrie-former teammate, and yes the Celtics   Lamarcus and Blake have no connection to LeBron. When Aldridge was in the Spurs there was no rivalry, same with Blake on the clippers   But harden lost to LeBron last year in the playoffs and in the Finals in 2012 so that‚Äôs his connection"
"Andre ""can guard 1-5"" Drummond and LaMarcus ""defensive IQ"" Aldridge for first team all Defense."
"You're not wrong about him constantly talking about him, but everything he's saying is true. His loyalty and belief in ""doing it right"" makes him a rare breed in the super team era. He also had a homegrown super team pulled from under his feet by injuries. Can you imagine a starting 5 of Dame Lillard, Brandon Roy, Lamarcus Aldridge, Greg Oden, and Wesley Matthews? With Batum coming off the bench???  If more great players showed his character and values the NBA as a whole would be a unquestionably better product than it is today. If the worst thing he does is be a little self righteous, I think we can let him be.   I'm really not a Lebron hater, but I really do believe him going to Miami changed the whole league. The 2007-2012 Celtics seemed crazy overpowered at the time, but that was nothing compared to the recent super teams. Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen were all-stars but they weren't all top 5 in the league.  Dame is the man and Portland fans are lucky to have him."
"&gt; It's very clearly a flaw in the system that allows the rich to get richer at no cost.      I mean, technically by your logic the rich aren't getting richer because they are signing for the vet minimum.      You can create a new system all you want, teams will find out a way to get around it. In these instances, the teams are not being forced to keep the player for the remainder of the season, it makes them look better because players will see that the team takes their situations into consideration. And it's not like it's Nikola Vucevic forcing the Magic to buy him out and then him trotting over to LA or Brooklyn. These are over the hill vets who want a shot at the championship. Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are the 4th or 5th option **at best** respectively as a scoring option on the floor with Durant/Harden/Irving. Then you need to take into account, arguably, the best 3 pt shooter in the league in Joe Harris, if he's on the floor, those guys are below him IMO.      Just admit you're upset because it's not *your* team like the memes above."
"Kd, Lamarcus aldridge, blake griffin, nicholas claxton, bruce brown, Jeff green. I think our front office is smart enough to know we can beat the best bigs 1:1 on defense. But with enough front court depth, we can replenish stamina in shorter minutes and keep em on their toes."
"got damn he played 23 years! So weird to think he played against Kareem who was in the league in the 60‚Äôs and guys like Lebron, Dwight, and Lamarcus Aldridge who are still playing in the nba currently. 50 years apart LMAO!"
"Yeah, exactly.  Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge as a 1 or 2 option...ehh not very great at this point in their careers.  As bench players, they're awesome, and that's the frustration when they go there for basically nothing."
"Jimmy Butler: ‚ÄúWhat now, Lamarcus Aldridge?!‚Äù"
I don't understand the outrage about the buyout market. Never thought Lamarcus Aldridge is where we draw the line üòÇ
But they didn't have Lamarcus ALdridge!
"Yes, for sure, Andre Drummond, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Jeff Teague, all equally good. You definitely get it."
"Neither Blake or Aldridge were stars two years ago though. That‚Äôs like saying Melo was a star in 2016 before he got traded to OKC. He was still washed, just still getting shots. Best case scenario is that one of these guys is as good as Rondo or Dwight were in the playoffs for LA. Even that is wishful thinking seeing as both those guys had an entire year with the team to find roles. Adding Blake and Lamarcus moves the needle for them about as much as adding Gasol and Wes Matthews has moved it for the Lakers. It‚Äôs nice when they can string together half decent minutes every once in a while but they aren‚Äôt really helping the team. Yeah Blake and Lamrcus can possibly give them 10-15 points in a couple playoff games but they will both be largely useless by the ECFs possibly earlier, so who cares?"
They literally just got one of the better buy out guys on the market in Gorgeui Dieng without even being a contender. They got one of the most impactful buy out guys in modern history in Boris Diaw in 2014. They got a max star in lamarcus aldridge that every big market team was after. I think you need to take that /s off your comment.
How when at the start of the season both Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge sucked?
"I mean they aren't *at that level* but find me an NBA player on a 1yr/1m contract that you'd rather have than Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge or Andre Drummond."
I have no idea how that is relevant to the argument I am making. Do you honestly think Lamarcus Aldridge and Drummond are minimum guys? No they are taking so little money because someone else is paying their salary.
"I think people make waaaaay too much out of this. The NBA cap is and always has been a soft cap. You get to sign players for the league minimum at any time. If those players have some sort of circumstance where they feel they are available for the league minimum when they ""should"" be making more, that's on the player, not the team signing them, and in some very real ways that's an example of the cap working (because without it a Lamarcus Aldridge might command a $10M salary in addition to the money he's getting back from his old team). You don't want a player signed to a half-year rental on the cheap? Don't cut that player. Trade them if you can (of course, if you're just going to cut them if you can't find a buyer and everyone knows that, that will also lessen your trade power).  The other reason why this is a mountain being made out of a molehill is that half-year aspect. Even in the cases where these players still have value - I guess that's true for Aldridge, but I'm not sure that's at all true for Blake Griffin, for instance - there's going to be a feeling-out and ramping-up process that will take some time to complete and the team as constituted may not even be ready to go by the playoffs. And after the playoffs, a player signed to the league minimum is free to be signed by anyone; the renter doesn't even Bird rights on them (as they shouldn't).  I don't see how this is any different from, say, the Lakers in the early 2000s signing guys like Karl Malone, Gary Payton, and Glen Rice in the offseason to chase rings. If anything, that scenario is ""worse"" inasmuch as those players chose to take below-market contracts at a time when their team had literally months to figure out what to do with them. Also, Mailman/GP/Rice all had more left in their collective tanks than guys who are literally being dumped for salary reasons. And I mean, those deals weren't even all that successful in the long run, were they? I guess Malone got his ring with the Lakers, but as a rotation guy, and GP had to go off to Miami and have a whole second career as a veteran PG to pick up his.  This isn't even a ""big market"" vs. ""small market"" issue, this is a ""teams that are good and want to take a flier on an extra piece"" vs ""teams that are not good enough"" issue. You're not seeing the Chicago Bulls or Dallas Mavericks bidding for any of these players."
It's because of a mix of casual NBA fans and the effect of places like ESPN making graphics or headlines putting heavy emphasis on signing MULTIPLE TIME ALL STAR BLAKE GRIFFIN/LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE.
"&gt;Where lmao, those guys were basically all washed and thats why they went to buyouts.  Like Blake and LaMarcus Aldridge?  Drummond? Y'all have been going on and on about how much he sucks.  Sam Cassell, Damon Stoudemire, Marbury, Joe Smith, Michael Finley, Jerry Stackhouse, Larry Hughes, Mike Bibby...and you know what that's only a handful of years. I'm not going to go through the entire list and list everyone that averaged over 20 a game for at least a season. If you don't recognize the star-studded list of names in that article, that's your own fault.  This sub has been going on about how much these three players suck asshole and that they're all washed and yet now y'all are crying about how unfair it is that these washed players got bought out?  Fucking crazy watching y'all somersault back and forth with this mental gymnastic shit.  &gt;Theres almost no parity, just 3/4 teams that contend every year for a decade.  Have you just started watching the NBA this year? Would explain why you couldn't recognize any of those names on the list lmao.  The Lakers missed the playoffs for almost a decade. The Nets got fucking relocated lol. They haven't made the Finals in 17 years. The Raptors won their first title fucking ever.  What is this made up fucking non-sense?"
So Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are no longer good players?  Then why are we all so bent out of shape they went to Brooklyn?!?
I mean yes....  Also none of these players are gonna end up mattering almost never do. If the nets win it won‚Äôt be because of the play of Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge
"4 years ago, a lineup of Irving/Harden/KD/Griffin/Aldridge probably would challenge Golden State for best lineup ever.  Still a monster lineup now even though Blake and LaMarcus have lost a step."
"You hear that nets fans? Turn off your TVs and don‚Äôt watch another stupid game, we‚Äôve signed LaMarcus Aldridge."
"I imagine whenever Aldridge plays, they're going to make him play some serious drop coverage on picks and tell him to give up jumpshots when switched. LaMarcus has typically done pretty well when matched up against AD and could definitely give some minutes for them against him. Claxton is too skinny to be guarding AD in the post, they will have to double team right away if he is guarding AD."
+ Prime Harden  + Prime Kyrie  + Deandre Jordan  + Blake Griffin  + LaMarcus Aldridge.   Heck half of the old Team USA.
"damn, that sniper took out meyers leonard AND lamarcus aldridge"
"I think the NBA needs to do more to prevent super teams from forming.  I think the idea of a super team like the Dream Team is cool but when used in an 82 game format, diminishes the overall product.  This has caused the ring chasing dilemma because there is no parity.  Role players sacrifice money to join a super team and can bolster their legacies with rings.   Brooklyn is the only team right now with a bona-fide big three and they are clearly favored to win it all.  The fact that the Nets could pull off landing KD, Kyrie, and Harden is incredible but should never happen.  Its cool to watch them play together but from a fan's perspective, there is no real competition.  That is not good for a professional sport where every guy on every team works hard to win.  The worst part is they know they don't have a shot at winning.  Sports are about competition and while super teams push other teams to get better, its almost like playing 2k without turning the salary cap on lol.  Of course you're going to win if three top 10 players are on the same team.  In answer to OP, championships should only be used as a way to separate players with similar careers when comparing them in GOAT or hall of fame conversations.  When Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge inevitably get a ring this year, I don't think it will bolster either of their legacies much.  Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki only had one ring but no one is saying those two had better careers than them.  However, compare them to someone on their allstar caliber level like Zach Randolph or Amare Stoudemire who never won a championship, then their rings hold some merit as to who had the better career."
only casuals think andre drummond or lamarcus aldridge are even good lol. drummond is the definition of empty stats
LaMarcus Aldridge surely isn‚Äôt a HOF player
He's never been good. He grabbed a lot of rebounds and put up a lot of points on well below league average efficiency.  Both Blake Griffin and Lamarcus aldridge are better than Drummond right now.
"Right but who is going to be sitting there 15 years from now saying ""Well, LaMarcus Aldridge is the 362nd best player of all time and I have DeMar DeRozan at 363. I liked Deebo's game more but Aldridge had that big ring at 35 years old where he averaged 6 points in 10 minutes on the KD/Harden/Kyrie Nets so I gotta give him the edge."""
"TLDR: Nobody is going to value ""LaMarcus Aldridge averages 6 minutes a game for the Brooklyn Nets and wins a ring"" more than ""Jimmy Butler takes team of Goran Dragic and 1st/2nd/3rd year players to the finals and loses."" If someone believes these former All-NBA players are trash for not winning rings as the primary options in their primes, they aren't going to suddenly change their minds and think they're gods now that they're riding the bench as the 10th option at 62 years old. People here are constantly attacking the narrative that rings are *all* people care about and that these players being dragged to the finish line in the bum stage of their careers is somehow going to change how they're perceived. No sane person actually believes that."
"in terms of their peak with the team and considering tenure on the Spurs, I don't think you can dispute this list very much.  Tim Duncan  David Robinson  George Gervin  Kawhi Leonard  Tony Parker  LaMarcus Aldridge  DeMar DeRozan  Manu Ginobili  Sean Elliott  James Silas  Alvin Robertson  Bruce Bowen"
Reminds me of the Lakers pitch to Lamarcaus Aldridge and they made the PPT LAmarcus Aldridge
"LeBron deserves to be on the list because toward the end of Kobe‚Äôs career, the overall impression around the league was that the Lakers ceased to be a free agent destination like they had been for most of their existence. Carmelo rebuffed the Lakers to rejoin the Knicks. LaMarcus Aldridge chose San Antonio over LA. LeBron didn‚Äôt even give the Lakers a meeting before signing with Cleveland. He eventually signed a few years later with a non-playoff, rebuilding Lakers team and then heavily influenced the trade to acquire AD, which led to an immediate championship and AD‚Äôs long term contract, bringing legitimacy back to the Lakers name.   I think Jerry West is more salty about the inclusion of Phil Jackson more than anything. Tension with Phil eventually led to West leaving the organization in 2000, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs still animosity over that. Can‚Äôt deny Phil though because he coached 5 of the Lakers 17 championships. Jeanie should‚Äôve kept the list limited to players though to avoid this."
Because star free agents had been rejecting the Lakers during that period. Guys like Lamarcus Aldridge and Kevin Durant were rejecting them.
"&gt; and Dame won that matchup  *Lamarcus Aldridge* won that, not sure if you remember but Dame was not the first option back then  that series revolved around how LMA feasted on dwight and terrence jones"
Lebron was instrumental to turning us back into the Lakers.    After Dr Buss died the Lakers were in shambles. Front office was a fucking mess.    Lebron arrives. Shit changes. We win a championship and are THE Lakers again.    He is definitely important. Or yall forgetting nobody wanted to sign with the Lakers and Lamarcus aldridge wine and dined us. #StayDwight   Lebron made you forget all that lol.
"Those same miami beat guys (5 reasons sports) have literally made up multiple fake stories this year.

"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
"Got curious and looked up LaMarcus Aldridge too, ~42% for his career on 16+ ft 2s."
"I agree with all the first parts of your post.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't disrespect Bogut. He was a very good passer for a big and a good defender. We got away with having Zaza and Javale because we had that line up of death with Steph, Klay, Iggy, KD and Draymond. Also it's not like we met any teams with a dominant big. Except AD in Pelicans, but well. It was not like he really had any help.   There was no Giannis, Embiid or Jokic we had to beat. Hell, I just looked the line ups of our opponents after Bogut left. The best center we met in the playoff was probably Clint Capela. Not really a guy you can ask to go get 30 a night. LaMarcus Aldridge is probably the best big we had to face. But he plays right into how Draymond defends.   My point is that the other teams really didn't have a punish for that line up."
Kevin Love   Bradley Beal   Domantas Sabonis   Nikola Vucevic   Al Horford   Paul Millsap   LaMarcus Aldridge   Mike Conley   Khris Middleton   DeMarcus Cousins   CJ McCollum
Lamarcus Aldridge and Milsap both come to mind as multiple time allstars
I know he's retired but what about Lamarcus Aldridge? Does Portland retire his number?
"50% of LeBron coming to the Lakers probably does have to do with LA but the other 50% has to do with Magic and Rob convincing him. There is no way LeBron comes to the Lakers if Jim Dumbass Buss and Mitch Kupchak were still running shit. From 2013-2016 they struck out on every big name free agent (Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron who they were going after in 2014, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and Kevin Durant didn't even wanna give them a meeting in 2016). Magic and Rob changed the FO culture and just in time too or else we wouldn't have LeBron and AD"
"Hawks fans will forever deny the fact that Nate McMillan had Gary Payton, Ray Allen, LaMarcus Aldridge, Zach Randolph, Brandon Roy, Rashard Lewis, and Paul George on his teams and was 17-36 in the playoffs with all of them in their primes."
"Kevin Durant on a game 6. Not a superstar at all.  On teams playing against us probably Joe Johnson or LaMarcus Aldridge, they used to murder us back in the day."
"Perhaps, but Dantley's game also wasn't one that particularly lent itself to admiration and imitation. It was effective but boring to many.   In contrast, Dominique Wilkins experienced even less team success than Dantley during that same era but is considerably more memorable.   I think someone like LaMarcus Aldridge is more likely to be lost in time than a guy like Carmelo, who had a nice cult following throughout his career."
Lamarcus Aldridge
"Greg Oden only suited up with Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge for 62 games. They won 50 of them, which is at a 66-win pace when they all played together."
"I can‚Äôt find the specific numbers so this may be wrong, but I know demar derozan‚Äôs on/off splits have been better since Jakob Poeltl got inserted into the starting lineup and Lamarcus Aldridge got bought out, do the numbers back me up?"
"I said this last time, but remember when Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond all got bought out and signed with big teams and everyone acted like they were top 10 players? I got so much shit on this sub for saying that non of those guys will have a big impact, and look at them now lol."
"My favorite Spanish basketball player is la one, la only,  Lamarcus Aldridge"
LaMarcus Aldridge shoulda been a Blazer forever
"LaMarcus Aldridge, too."
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
Or the god himself Lamarcus Aldridge
lamarcus aldridge
Popovich said that he envisioned a more Jack Sickma-like perimeter role for LaMarcus Aldridge when he first came to the Spurs. It didn't work out. LaMarcus struggled to adapt to a more face-up style and eventually Pop caved and let the big guy play like he did in Portland: with his back to the basket from the left block.  I can't help but think how ironic it was that an old-school coach tried to get his player to model his game after a guy who played in the 70's in order to evolve his game to the modern era. Sickma was way ahead of his time.
"Aldridge literally retired and blocked them from signing someone else. Obvious it was completely out of every parties hands, but that doesn‚Äôt make it good overall. LaMarcus would have been the most impact if his heart stayed right"
LaMarcus Aldridge
"Remember during the buyout period when everyone was flipping shit and acting like Blake griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge and Andre Drummond were insane pickups? That was funny."
Giannis shouldn't be listed as a PF. Dude plays nothing like LaMarcus Aldridge.
a joke would be letting someone like lamarcus aldridge in and leaving rose out
They should. Someone like Derrick Rose deserves to be in the HoF more than someone like Lamarcus Aldridge or Spencer Haywood
lamarcus aldridge.
"Although arguably that shot may well have sown the first seeds of discontent in LaMarcus Aldridge's mind about his future in Portland, leading to his departure in free agency one year later.   Aldridge came into the league as a highly touted talent, but Portland was Brandon Roy's team. And then it became the future Greg Oden's team. Then tragically both Roy and Oden were lost to injury, and briefly it became LMA's team. But that shot proved to him and everyone else that the Blazers were now young Damian Lillard's team. So Aldridge went home to  Texas where the Spurs could now be his team, even though it was already Kawhi's team by that point."
He doesn‚Äôt have Embiid‚Äôs imposing size or his skill level. If he did he would have flashed it by now. If he was more aggressive inside and developed the mid range maybe a Lamarcus Aldridge comp could be made. If he could pick and pop that could unlock his game but it sure don‚Äôt look like the Suns are very interested in developing it...
"This was my first time playing fantasy, long time gambling addict and degenerate so I knew a lot but I had some growing pains, especially in an 18 man league. I took KAT, he went down with his wrist, then covid, traded him and Lavine (rip), and Lamarcus Aldridge (dodged a bullet) for Beal, De'Andre Hunter (went down for the entire season pretty much for me) Divencenzo.. eventually I ended up with Giannis and Sabonis which has been huge for me; I've lucked out on a lot of waiver wire players, Moses Brown, Bruce Brown, Diallo had a hot streak for me, etc.  The easiest way to win in fantasy is to punt 4 categories. I try to go for FG%, rebounds, blocks, steals, and then the last one is usually a toss up for assists or t/o's (I have Draymond.. Dray+Sabonis+Giannis has given me so many assists this season)  Next time I'll be able to hone in on that fifth category lol. Sometimes I win ft% even."
"Brandon Roy was drafted alongside LaMarcus Aldridge. They were on the All-Rookie 1st team together. In his 1st year he also had Zach Randolph who led the team in scoring. How much more help did he need?  Anyways, his situation isn‚Äôt really comparable with Luka. Injuries wise, he had issues from the time he got into the league"
"Yeah, looking at that list of names, only LaMarcus Aldridge was a bigger name to move teams. And DeAndre Jordan, almost. üöÄ"
"&gt;Sure, but again they are in a big market and that‚Äôs pretty much a necessary condition for all of the above to matter.  Sure. And Stockpiling the assets and clearing the cap space was a necessary condition too.   Back when Lakers had no assets nor a ton of cap space they couldn‚Äôt even convince Lamarcus Aldridge to join for the max. Durant and Melo didn‚Äôt even give them meetings."
"&gt; The players you listed that would have been top 5 in 2012 would not have been top 5 in 2011. Wade, Lebron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight  I think there's a typo in what you wrote, but many of those players now are playing at a higher level than Dwight has ever played (Giannis and AD are both easily better than Dwight ever was, for starters), and higher than Kobe in 2011 who averaged a ho-hum 25/5/5 on 55% TS.  &gt; This would be the top 10 in 2010-2011 time; Kobe/Lebron/CP3/Wade/Dwight/Dirk/Duncan/Rose/Durant/Carmelo.  I used the year 2012 so let's go with that (it's slightly better towards the late 2000s as you get more into the prime of Kobe, KG, Duncan, Nash, Dirk, and others).  Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Kobe were clearly past their prime by 2012 (and had a much greater dropoff in production than, say, LeBron at a similar age).  &gt; Some notable guys left off the list include Rondo(lead Celtics to a 7 game series against 2011-2012 Heat), Chris Bosh, Griffin, Love, etc.  I don't see any argument that any of these players are anywhere near any of the players I listed.  Bosh, Griffin, and especially Love (who joined Cleveland at 26 in what should have been his absolute prime and then was instantly revealed to actually be a pure good stats/bad team player), are not as good as Giannis, AD, Jokic, and Embiid (to name the big men alone).    The early 2010s also included other all-NBA selections like David Lee, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler, etc.  Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge made all-NBA teams virtually every year during this timeframe.  Again, all perfectly fine players, but none of them are anywhere near the players I mentioned, and none of them had any significant success as the best player on their teams (not even talking about success in terms of 'titles' but even 'winning playoff series').   &gt; Also the pace and scoring was also just much lower back then  I do think it's easy for pace and scoring to inflate our opinions of some modern players (e.g. if you took Zach LaVine's stats and put them in 2012 he'd look like the third best player in the league or something), but everything indicates that many of the guys I mentioned are having much more impact on their teams winning than, say, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love or Chris Bosh were doing in the early 2010s."
"Yup. NBA just doesn't really see much star free agency movement (especially when you exclude the players that are moving to create super teams with whoever currently has cap space, and look instead solely at the players that moved for the destination).  Biggest name that moved in free agency in the past decade that wasn't moving to create/join a super team is probably Al Horford to Boston, Terry Rozier to the Hornets, or Andre Iguodala to the Warriors. edit: LaMarcus Aldridge to the Spurs."
"No the Clips had one thing that isn't market related and that's Jerry Freaking West. They got rid of Blake to make cap room and also drafted well with SGA. Yeah you could argue how better/worse it was compared to other teams but they were definitely in a tough spot resigning Blake. I mean both Kawhi and PG are from here and wanted to come home to play, so I guess that's the big market argument there.   I mean LaMarcus Aldridge chose the Spurs over bigger markets (us included.) Yeah every team is going to use whatever advantage they can to get players, but being in a small market isn't the be all end all. Some of the teams in those small markets are just run poorly. And no, if Lebron doesn't come here we still make the playoffs at some point, we had some young talent at the time. Its just with someone else."
"Oh?  Just one 4th quarter in the year 2000 and we would've been in the Finals. That made us a contender.  When Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge and Greg Oden were healthy enough to play together, they were 50-12. That's a 66-win pace, far exceeding the 40-20 regular season ""contender"" metric. That made us a contender."
"[Kevin O‚ÄôConnor of The Ringer reported Sunday that the Miami Heat are ‚Äúpursuing a deal for Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry harder than anyone.‚Äù He added that if Lowry gets dealt, his preferred destination would be to Miami due to his friendship with Jimmy Butler.](https://www.hothothoops.com/2021/3/21/22343686/miamj-heat-kyle-lowry-trade-duncan-robinson-tyler-herro-kelly-olynyk-lamarcus-aldridge)  [Lowry's top destination if he is traded is reportedly Miami, Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press reported Tuesday.](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-prefers-miami-heat-as-trade-destination)  cry more ü§°  he gone (just like every star in Raptor history) + Masai is washed"
"&gt;I mean Drummond is maybe the only recent example of an expiring not being very valuable?   Also LaMarcus Aldridge, and clearly the Pistons believed Blake Griffin was headed there as well as he was only a few months from being an expiring contract and he was bought out instead."
"It rarely works like that anymore, it's a pretty outdated idea, that someone on a huge expiring contract has value to other teams. The only teams who would want that are teams with even worse long term deals who are hoping to open up cap space to make a splash in free agency, and you don't see much of that anymore. Like for instance, this season LaMarcus Aldridge had a large expiring contract, and look what happened with him: he ended up getting bought out, rather than used as salary ballast in some blockbuster trade. Same thing with Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin.   These guys who are clearly not worth the last year of their huge contracts don't end up in some trade for another star like that anymore, they just get bought out. Odds are if the Cavs just hold onto Love till 2022-23 then he'll end up being bought out rather than traded for something that helps the Cavs."
"That is..... very interesting and I hadn't thought of that , I don't fully agree but then I look at how both Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge all of the sudden became Prime Kevin Garnett and Charles Barkley when they were added to the Nets and there and there might be a little something to this, although I think it's just more media spin than player mentality"

remember when Lamarcus Aldridge was on this team?
"&gt;Why does team seeding affect the individual MVP Award? This is a genuine question, no one explains why it does only say it does.   it's almost like winning = good  &gt;Currently I believe Steph Curry is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Warriors from being the worst team in the league. (Source 1-7 with him injured).  Currently I believe DeMar DeRozan is the MVP because he is the only thing keeping the Spurs from being the worst team in the league.  Wait, no... that doesn't work. I forgot you have to score more ppg to be eligible and 21 aint gonna cut it.  &gt;Everytime his name arises everyone shoots it down because 9th seed.. Why?  because they are the 9th seed.   Bradley Beal is averaging virtually the same stats and is sitting at the same seed and nobody is bringing his name up in MVP conversation.  I wonder why?  &gt;Leading the conversation however is Nikola Jokiƒá who is putting up amazing stats but is also on a better team.  hmm... almost like Jokic is giving a very compelling reason to be at the top of MVP conversation.  &gt;This leads to another question, why is there no Offensive Player Of the Year Award when there's a DPOY award?  there is. it's called the MVP (or 6MOTY if you're on the bench).  it's not that Curry isn't valuable to his team, it's that other players are having a more impressive season and largely the reason they are in the seeding position they're in.  the Warriors are in the position they're in and aren't a better seed because Klay is injured, and if Steph was as valuable as you say he is, the Warriors should still be comfortably in the Playoffs.  i didn't see LaMarcus Aldridge be given an MVP in 2018 for carrying the Spurs to the Playoffs was Kawhi was out essentially the entire season."
"LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Greg Oden played 62 games together. The Blazers record? 50-12."
Brandon Roy &amp; Lamarcus Aldridge :(
You mean in that 4 yr stretch where he made 2 2nd team all nba teams and Blake made 3 2nd teams and a 3rd team.   LaMarcus Aldridge was about on par with Love during this period too.
LaMarcus Aldridge
Better than highlights LaMarcus Aldridge   Worse Jason Williams
"Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez    They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge"
Lamarcus Aldridge had the 10th most minutes at the time I collected data (yesterday)
Why are they signing guards? If anything they should find a replacement for Lamarcus Aldridge
"not in the name of Lebron, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving, and Lamarcus Aldridge"
Somewhat related story.   I went on A vacation in Portland and it just so happened to be when lamarcus Aldridge had his first game back after leaving. Went to go grab food and saw the pizza place (sizzle pie) and they had a some menu item that said ‚Äú3 quarter something‚Äù and I thought I was like just 3 slices. Ended up getting a whole pizza for me and my wife. The usher laughed at me as I came back with a whole ass pizza. Smfh

Yes. His name is Lamarcus Aldridge.
"&gt;Everyone thought this game was going to be trash, but holy shit were we wrong. What a fucking game.    Lakers just destroyed the Nets with KD, Kyrie, Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin playing. Then destroyed the Utah Jazz, number 1 seed in the West  &gt;  All without any LeBron or AD.. Just a team of Kuzma, Caruso, KCP, Drummond and such lol  &gt;   But somehow, they lost to the fuckin Knicks.. I don't even know what to think"
We will see your LaMarcus Aldridge and raise you a Jabari parker
"But T-Mac at his peak was a far better player than LaMarcus ever was. T-Mac made two All-NBA First Teams, Aldridge never has."
They just did the same with LaMarcus Aldridge a couple days ago and it comes out that he‚Äôs retiring because of a serious heart condition so they pretend like nothing happened
"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
"Read this as LaMarcus Aldridge and was thinking that's the weirdest ""retire with a team"" move I've ever seen, haha."
"Nice summary here.  Missed opportunities, but still a top 5 Blazer.  [https://www.si.com/nba/2021/04/16/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-underrated-career-what-ifs](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/04/16/lamarcus-aldridge-retires-underrated-career-what-ifs)"
"LaMarcus Aldridge did the right thing it's always family before money or at least it should be but in this instance he has both, I wish him nothing but the best with his medical issue and his future endeavors. I always enjoyed watching him play but especially the way he shot the ball being as big as he is and bringing that ball up from the mid-chest to over his head and shooting was to me a non-blockable shot. Good luck to you from a Miami Heat fan."
Lamarcus aldridge  He's been commonly referred as LMA for the last like 6 seasons afaik (Ive been on this sub a long time..)
"His best statistical years were spent in Minnesota where they couldn't even crack .500  He got a ring in Cleveland alongside LeBron/Kyrie but played a much more supporting role, his statistical output also decreased greatly.   Since then injuries have basically ruined his career, and when he has played in recent years you'd think Kevin Love is closer to retirement than LaMarcus Aldridge  If people are saying no to LMA (5x All-NBA &amp; 7x All-Star) then Kevin Love is definitely not HOF material"
This MF really put Kiki ahead of LaMarcus.  Aldridge is 4th best without question.
What jersey one franchise retired has nothing to do with Portland and Lamarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge was forced to retire today after it was discovered that he has an irregular heartbeat. Tough way to go out.
"""Lamarcus Aldridge has 19951 points.  This means not all his points were from 2 pointers.  He has made free throws and 3 pointers"" -- Magic Johnson"
"oh it was very, very real in Portland.  [Here's a Woj piece from when Aldridge left the Blazers in free-agency for San Antonio that, as usual, has all the dirt](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-days-in-july--inside-the-free-agent-courtship-of-lamarcus-aldridge-225556837.html).  Some excerpts:   &gt; Throughout the final, formal meeting in late June, it became clear that Aldridge hadn‚Äôt completely let go of years-old issues with the way he believed ex-Blazers Brandon Roy and Greg Oden had overshadowed him in the early part of his career. This was part of Aldridge‚Äôs personality that everyone surrounding him understood ‚Äì that the teams recruiting him had researched and debated internally on how to navigate in the recruiting process.  &gt; Leaving that meeting in Dallas in late June, perhaps little was more telling than the fact Aldridge never raised one particular name: Damian Lillard. Ultimately, this was the enigma of LaMarcus Aldridge. He wanted talent around him, but never too much that it might cast a shadow on his own marquee. Pleasing Aldridge was never easy, and nobody knew that better than the Portland Trail Blazers.   &gt; Aldridge loathed driving around Portland and seeing those Lillard billboards that adidas had mounted for him ‚Äì even when the Blazers made Aldridge the centerpiece of every franchise marketing investment.    All of this tracks as a Spurs fan, right?  Aldridge never wanted to play the 5 even though he should, always demanded to start, and demanded a trade in 2018 because he was unhappy, right?"
"LaMarcus isn't really disliked out here, it's not like he gets the Raymond Felton treatment every time he comes back to the Moda Center.  That being said, he did leave in free agency and was not always the easiest personality inside the organization during his time in Portland.  He was always super duper sensitive and could be a bit prickly, there was friction with both Roy and Lillard during Aldridge's time as a Blazer.  Aldridge didn't want to be overshadowed by his teammates despite the fact that Roy was better than Aldridge when he was healthy &amp; playing and Lillard quickly ascended to his level (Lillard went out of his way to try &amp; make Aldridge happy and deflect the noise about him being the franchise player early in his career, I don't think Aldridge truly embraced him) and beyond early in his career.  There were stories published about how LaMarcus always wanted it both ways: he wanted to get all the credit and make sure he was getting recognition but then didn't always want to be accountable or take on the leadership role you'd expect from the face of the franchise.  The organization always supported Aldridge, though, sticking with him when he had health problems earlier in his career and doing everything they could to accommodate him."

LaMarcus Aldridge
If the Nets win this year does LaMarcus Aldridge get a ring?
LaMarcus Aldridge. Awful.
LaMarcus ‚ÄúFinesse‚Äù Aldridge
"I'm a long time LMA apologist, and this article helps explain some of his issues with acceptance.¬† He's a good and decent person who for some reason has encountered people throughout his life who want something else from him that what he is.  Excerpt from the article: &gt;Later that year, with the Texas-bound Aldridge averaging 28.9 points and 13.4 rebounds per game, Seagoville reached the Class 4A Region II final. A win would advance the Dragons to the state tournament. The game, against Lincoln ‚Äî and Bosh‚Äôs younger brother, Joel ‚Äî was an epic back-and-forth tussle that went into overtime. Aldridge had one purpose that season ‚Äî to lead Seagoville to the state championship game in Austin ‚Äî and he looked like a man possessed that night. Despite playing with two stress fractures in his back, Aldridge made 16 of 18 shots and finished with 39 points, nine rebounds and six blocks.But in crunch time, when Aldridge was most hungry, a perplexing thing happened ‚Äî he never touched the ball. Over the final three-plus minutes, Allen kept calling clear-outs and post-ups for his star, but Aldridge‚Äôs teammates refused to pass him the ball. With four seconds left, Bosh snatched a rebound under the hoop and made a layup, lifting Lincoln to a 69-68 victory at Moody Coliseum on the campus of SMU.Seagoville lost. Aldridge‚Äôs championship dreams were dead. The tears started as he walked off the court, and gushed in the postgame locker room.‚ÄúThey froze him out,‚Äù Allen said of Aldridge‚Äôs teammates. ‚ÄúHe was unstoppable and they froze him out. It really hurt me to see that and to see him cry like that. Because what he was basically saying was, ‚ÄòGuys, get on my back and ride me all the way to Austin.‚Äô He asked me, he said, ‚ÄòCoach, why?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòLaMarcus, it‚Äôs because a lot of people are sick with jealousy.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre going to face this in your life again. But hopefully you‚Äôll know how to deal with it because of this experience.‚Äô‚Äù"
"After Brandon Roy retired, watching him cook teams from the mid-range was really fun. Seeing him kick ass in 2014 was so fun. There was a stretch that I‚Äôd always pick him when I played fantasy drafts on 2k because he was so automatic. Lamarcus Aldridge was a pretty big part of the 2010s for me. I had really hoped he‚Äôd stick around long enough to come back to the blazers for a little bit, but damn seeing him leave with a heart problem is really worrying. I hope it doesn‚Äôt have any major long-term consequences and he‚Äôs able to live a long fulfilling life.   Thanks for the memories"
"Fuck, I have had all my life, I love playing soccer, most of my teams detected the conditions but only my senior highs school team didn‚Äôt allowed me to play. I‚Äôm still playing soccer and exercising, I know the consequences but I do love the sport and overall exercising and competing.  Seeing Lamarcus Aldridge retirement has brought an underlying feeling and it makes me wonder"
"Ehhhh if Mitch Richmond is in, both LaMarcus Aldridge and Joe Johnson are in, IMO. Should it be that way? No. I think Reggie Miller‚Äôs inclusion is highly debatable (got to a Finals, had a semi revolutionary play style, culturally relevant/visible but everything else from his skills to his career and accolades are underwhelming). But! The basketball HOF is very steep in the baseline being hall of good. 5-7 all stars, 2 All NBA seasons and some international success can get you in. Shit, at this trajectory, Domantas Sabonis is looking like a solid bet in 10 years. The process should be way more exclusive but LMA has been so solid over the years, that he meets the criteria."
"In a couple hours ""The Brooklyn Nets have acquired unrestricted free agent LaMarcus Aldridge..."""
I remember being in the trenches of random NBA Facebook groups arguing between KLove and LaMarcus Aldridge for best power forward in the league. He was a real baller especially with the Trailblazers and had a great NBA career. Wishing him good health and happiness in his new chapter.
Does LaMarcus Aldridge Nets merchandise exist? That Nets jersey might end up being worth a lot
Wow this makes me sad. The human body is such a complicated vessel and it's unfortunate that Aldridge is having to quit doing what he loves but at least he got to play for such a long and fun career. Almost like Chris Bosh where all of a sudden the player just isn't a player anymore... Good luck LaMarcus Aldridge in all your future pursuits!
"Who cares, LaMarcus Aldridge just retired"
Lamarcus Aldridge for HoF!
"I've always wondered if tall people like NBA players are more at-risk for these things. Reggie Lewis died of a heart disease but there's a lot of players in recent years who's had problems even though they're world-class athletes.   Cuttino Mobley, Channing Frye, and Lamarcus Aldridge had irregular heartbeat, Jeff Green had an enlarged artery, and Bosh and Teletovic had their careers ended with blood clots. I think Varejeo had it as well."
"Insane, how LaMarcus Aldridge could have also been part of this playoff rotation. He cooks in the clutch every time"
Shoutout to LaMarcus Aldridge.
if Lamarcus Aldridge was here  damn only if
"isnt the nets gameplan to let one of the three go nuclear   &amp;#x200B;  for one of them to carry the team through 4 quarters is probably just to much  &amp;#x200B;  watching durant play with this team almost makes me feel bad for him  &amp;#x200B;  then I remember that he joined the 73 win Warriors and left them to team up with Harden, Kyrie, Blake got Lamarcus aldridge and the list goes on"
"You could also argue that '03 Duncan faced way less talent than Dirk did in '11. He did heavier lifting, but he played arguably the worst Conference Champion (New Jersey Nets) in the last 30 seasons.  First round, close but I'd give the edge to Dirk :   * Duncan faced the 44 win Phoenix Suns, a near 0.500 team that outscored their opponents by 1 ppg * Dirk faced the 48 win Portland Trailblazers, outscored their opponents by almost 2 ppg, had a more experienced team. Additionally LaMarcus Aldridge is the best player across both teams.   2nd Round, advantage Duncan:  * Duncan faced the Kobe/Shaq Lakers, coming off 3x titled, however Shaq was injured most of the season and they were the 5th seed. * Dirk faced the Kobe/Pau Lakers, coming off 3 finals appearances and 2 straight titled. Highest SRS in the West, a better well rounded team than the 03 Lakers, but Shaq, despite struggling in the '03 playoffs and regular season is better than anyone on the '11 Lakers.  WCF Tie, maybe slight edge to Duncan:   * Duncan faced the Mavs without Dirk for the majority of the series. This Mavs team was incredible, arguably one of the best teams Dallas has fielded, but without Dirk they were missing an offensive big to draw Duncan and/or Robinson out of the paint to allow Nash/Finley/Van Exel to slash. Dallas was a better team than '11 Thunder but without Dirk it's close. * Dirk faced a young Thunder team, loaded with future stars, but still very raw. Thunder had 55 wins that year, compared to Dallas' 60 wins in '03. Overall Dirk was too much for the Thunder, averaging like 35 ppg in the series.   Finals advantage Dirk:  * Duncan faced the 49 win Nets, led admirably by Jason Kidd, but dear god this team making the finals is a joke. Eastern conference from 99 to 07 was an absolute joke aside from the 04-06 Pistons teams.  * Dirk faced the Miami Heat with LeBron/Wade/Bosh. 2 Top 5ish players in the league and Bosh was a top 20 player.   Duncan had the distinction of being the Spurs best offensive player and best defensive player, while Dirk was just on offense, but Dirk had to play stiffer competition. Even Duncan got to avoid the 59 win Sacramento Kings, who Dallas took out in 7 games in the WCSF. I'm not arguing one way or another, just saying it's not ""clearly better than Dirks"""
"&gt;he‚Äôs never had a roster built for that  He needs a creative genius ball handler‚Äîhe has no understanding of offensive concepts at all, though he‚Äôs a pretty good defensive coach. He and Trae are made for each other because he lets Trae do Trae while scheming up the defense which is good for both parties.   I watched him for years on the blazers and his ‚Äúoffense‚Äù just consisted of Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge taking turns isoing in the mid post. It was truly horrible to watch, even though it was reasonably efficient most of the time."
Lamarcus Aldridge
The Nets really need Kyrie and Harden to come back soon. I can't imagine the current Nets with KD as the primary focus being able to content with a healthy Bucks squad. Man imagine if LaMarcus Aldridge didn't have to retire. They really need him right now.
"I‚Äôm going to get absolutely crucified for this one but,  Peak LaMarcus Aldridge is on the same tier as guys like peak Carmelo or peak Paul Pierce"
"&gt; I'm with Dray on ball kicking, but not with Zaza on destroying ankles. Zaza v. Kawhi was gross - you don't try to injure a player like that.   Did you feel the same way when Lamarcus Aldridge did the same thing to Steph later in the same game?"
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **Who‚Äôs *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
Like LaMarcus Aldridge circa 2015
its a losing battle with Stotts haters sadly. They completely forget he put out amazing offenses built around LaMarcus Aldridge his first couple years and was hired because of the work he did with Dirk.   He went all in the last few years on the best percentage looks trying to find a way to get the team over the hump which maybe was less pretty to watch at times but produced incredible numbers and it was really the only move with the limited skill set of the wings on the roster
"Terry also put out elite offenses based around LaMarcus Aldridge and had a lot of input on Dirk's title run offense. The last few years he adjusted and went all in on the best percentage looks (3's, Dame PnR, Dame/CJ isos) because that was the best chance the team had to win"
"LaMarcus Aldridge?  Come on, bro, he played like 2 games for the Nets and retired."
Indiana could use a new direction.    Tank for 3-5 years and draft future superstars in the lottery while looking for underappreciated gems through the usual Indiana way via trades and mid-lottery.  Kevin Pritchard seemed to do fine with top lottery picks - seeing as how he drafted Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge while also being heavily in favor of Chris Paul.  Maybe Bird can figure out the mid-lottery picks.
"You can say hingsight all you want, but Kevin Love at that point was a top 3 PF in the game. It was him, Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge. It's funny how Bosh was also a top 10 player in the NBA when the Heatles came together and in that team, his numbers also went down drastically and most called him overrated. Now, Bosh was better than Love as he could actually move his feet and defend, but he was usually the scapegoat when things went wrong for the Heatles."
LaMarcus Aldridge 2.0
Lamarcus Aldridge retired bro
"Damn. Imagine if the Nets had a healthy Harden and still have LaMarcus Aldridge on their team. Who can stop them? Just seeing Kyrie, KD, and to a lesser extent Blake play against the Bucks already seem so unfair"
Better our hearts than his ‚ù§ Zing!   (Get better LaMarcus Aldridge!)
Because he lives on in our hearts. May LaMarcus Aldridge rest in peace.
Here's a scary thought: if not for a freak illness this team could have LaMarcus Aldridge at the 5 and if not for a freak ACL tear they also would have Spencer Dinwiddie in the line-up. Oh and James Harden is in street clothes on the bench.
"They mortgaged their future for a super team for a couple of years and some other stars jumped on board to try and win a ring. Imagine if they still had LaMarcus Aldridge, yeesh."
Imagine if this team we are watching right now had James Harden and LaMarcus Aldridge lmao
Lol imagine if this team had Harden and LaMarcus Aldridge suited up right now
Get him a mirror that‚Äôs just a picture of LaMarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge
The new lamarcus aldridge
"I have no doubts someone will want to join us. I mean just this season we already recruited Blake and Lamarcus Aldridge lol. Barring injuries, We‚Äôre gonna tear up the league next year. Unless there‚Äôs another major move of a superstar like kawhi to lakers or something, the league is fucked."
So did LaMarcus Aldridge
DONT FORGET THE NETS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE JEFF GREEN AND LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE RIGHT NOW TOO
"Uh... Dirk 2011? 27.7 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists on 49/46/94 shooting on a not great Mavericks team, beat Brandon Roy/LaMarcus Aldridge Blazers, Kobe/Derek Fisher Lakers, Durant/Westbrook Thunder, superteam Heat"
Stotts can build a system around an elite forward. You see how the Mavs looked with Dirk and how we looked with Lamarcus.     He hasn't had anyone close to Sabonis' level to work with since Aldridge left.
"Sounds like we're looking for LaMarcus Aldridge, haha"
"&gt;Kind of hope Schroder comes back and lays into him for walking out when the job got tough.  Lmao dude had fucking AIDS, in the 90s.  Try to tell LaMarcus Aldridge that he's soft for retiring because of his heart condition."
"Lamarcus Aldridge announced his retirement this season after suffering an irregular heartbeat. As someone who also retired due to issues with your cardiovascular system(which are not as obvious as physical injuries), how did you feel about his decision. Did he ever talk to you before making that decision? If not did you ever say anything to him after hearing about his decision."
"Hey Chris, I‚Äôm sure you get tired of being asked questions related to your retirement but I was curious if you had reached out to LaMarcus Aldridge once he announced his abrupt retirement, since it was under similar circumstances. If not, I‚Äôd there any advice you would give based on your experience with having to leave the game ‚Äúearly‚Äù?"
"With Aldridge retiring suddenly due to his heart, what advice do you have for LaMarcus Aldridge, who a long time colleague that goes back to your Texas AAU and high school days?"
Lamarcus Aldridge
Wasn‚Äôt LaMarcus Aldridge a buyout that looked great for the nets before he had to retire?
"alongside Andrea Bargnani, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, and Rajon Rondo."
"DeAndre Jordan was once all NBA first team and leading the league in blocks per game. Don't forget they had LaMarcus Aldridge, too."
"Nets deserve a shout I reckon. Prime KD, Harden, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, Jordan, and (Lamarcus Aldridge if you count him) are very very good."
"Never forget when this sub thought the buyout market was ruining the league because the Lakers and Nets got Lamarcus Aldridge (retired), Andre Drummond (washed), and Blake Griffin (washed)"
The Lamarcus Aldridge special.
"What have the Chicago Bulls done in that time frame? James Harden‚Äôs second and third options in 2017 were Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly and they were up against Kawhi Leonard, Manu, TP, and Lamarcus Aldridge. Kawhi missed game 6 but LMA was still an ALL NBA caliber player. There‚Äôs a reason why the Spurs nearly broke the home record.There‚Äôs also a lot more to the 0-27 bs. Chris Paul was out and the refs made questionable calls and no calls that forced HOU to switch to perimiter over rim, of which one of the 3s during the 0-27 wasn‚Äôt counted when Harden drained a 3+1 over Klay but the refs called it as a foul before the shot went off causing the possession to reset. That shit changes momentum.Fuck you want him to do, take down Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Kevin Durant by himself? Don‚Äôt come at me with that bs."
Not anymore but previously yeah we got all the players on their last legs. Our only major signing has been LaMarcus Aldridge.
"I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make. The Mavs signed free agent Monta Ellis in 2013, because he liked the organization. LaMarcus Aldridge joined the Spurs because he liked the org. Utah and Denver have only been good recently, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they try to get free agent signings this offseason. That doesn‚Äôt make Boston a destination city, no one wants to live here"
"Once again, LaMarcus Aldridge is very much alive. He is retired and lives in Tampa"
Lamarcus Aldridge   RIP
LaMarcus Aldridge already doing NBA media. Love to see it
LaMarcus talking about KD made me realize they only missed each other by 1 season in college - Aldridge was at Texas 04/05 and 05/06 and Durant was there 06/07.
Touching tribute to LaMarcus Aldridge
This reminds of the time that Phoenix‚Äôs big selling point to LaMarcus Aldridge to sign with them was they got Tyson Chandler
Y'all should really chill on this.  It's not that funny and I'm sure it just makes it easier for him to speak to the general public.  LaMarcus Aldridge used this expression similarly and it helped him through his speech impediment.  Y'all just beating this joke to death.
You must be 12 years old because prime Lamarcus aldridge was one of the best post players of this generation
"I think he means guys that just do the same shit over and over and over that you can‚Äôt stop. All LaMarcus did was pick and pop to the mid range , fade over his shoulder going baseline and drive middle and made a hall of fame level career out of that.   Yes there are guys like Jokic and Embiid who are better players and more versatile but there might not be another player let alone big like Aldridge ever again"
"I love Lamarcus Aldridge, don‚Äôt know when we‚Äôll see a player like him as dominant as him any time soon"
"And Joker will be gone from Denver if he's still not. We don't know how good they'll be the next couple years.   His comment is meaningless. Didn't ya'll have LaMarcus Aldridge saying the same things?    Wtf was gonna say, ""No I hate Denver and will be leaving or demanding a trade soon?"""
Sheed is 5th all time in win shares for the blazers according to basketball reference (I would link but think you need a stathead account to view).  Lamarcus Aldridge is 4th (not a jail blazer) but wonder what happens with him.  Lillard is already 2nd and no doubt he gets O retired.
man Amare was the fuckin man. I think for a short period of time there were trade talks of Amare for Lamarcus Aldridge and J. Bayless from Portland. I could be wrong but I remember him being that good
LaMarcus Aldridge did something similar in Portland and then bounced to the Spurs in free agency.
"""I was jealous of Josh Childress at one point""  Why were you jealous of one of the goofiest looking players in NBA history? He looked like Ludacris &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge made a baby in Steve Urkel's cloning machine."
LaMarcus Aldridge retiring was a part of that too
I don't really like being beholden to Klutch either but I'll take winning a championship within 2 years of Lebron's arrival over wallowing in mediocrity with BI/Lonzo/Randle and whatever second/third tier star we might have been able to lure.  This is a franchise that was begging LaMarcus Aldridge for a second meeting.
LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Damien lillard, Brandon Roy, Gerald Wallace, Lamarcus Aldridge and Greg oden..   no joke game over. I‚Äôm assuming no one gets hurt of course. Hahaha"
"There are examples of teams doing a solid for non-stars.  Why do you think 40 year old Udonis Haslem is still on the Heat rooster?   Ex-Laker's big, Marc Gasol, gets a cushy job as Laker's ""development coach"".  I'm expecting the something similar will happen for Kevon Looney for playing through the playoffs with a broken collarbone. Which led to permanent nerve damage.  It's funny, this year they're not even trying to be subtle. They're straight up buying out contracts and letting players go where they want.  Cavs did Andre Drummond a solid. Pistons did Blake Griffin a solid. Spurs did Lamarcus Aldridge a solid."
"Are you comparing Tim Duncan to Mike Conley? Duncan was getting MVP votes, All NBA selections and All Defense selections while Kawhi was his teammate. Do you think Kawhi was carrying the 2014 Spurs to their championship that year or something? He only averaged 13 ppg that year.   Tony Parker also made no fewer than 3 All NBA teams as Kawhi's teammate. LaMarcus Aldridge was All NBA twice as Kawhi's teammate, and once finished top 10 in MVP voting before Kawhi left. Kyle Lowry is a 6x All Star, including the one year he was with Kawhi.  Then we have Mike Conley, who's never made an All NBA team and this year made his first All Star team as an injury replacement. You're way off here, sorry. Kawhi has had *plenty* of help in his career."
"Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam and Paul George. These guys have all been All Stars and All NBA players. ""No stars"" üôÑ"
"Ok then that means Lamarcus Aldridge is higher all-time Blazer than Walton? If so then that‚Äôs fine, I disagree but I get your stance."
reminds me of the Lamarcus Aldridge Marc Gasol post
Lamarcus Aldridge knows
[Oh you're right he wasn't a top-tier superstar I admit. I guess the ones on this list aren't too? ](https://www.sbnation.com/2015/7/2/8880797/la-lakers-lamarcus-aldridge-rumors-nba-free-agency-2015)  I mean it's not rocket science that shit-run teams don't attract free agents even if it's the Lakers  But yeah that doesn't fit your narrative my bad.  Big markets bad grrrr
"Oh how could I forget superstar lamarcus Aldridge, who's definitely a superstar."
Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge in shambles.
Don‚Äôt forget Brandon Roy!!! and Lamarcus Aldridge
If it weren't for injuries they'd have Spencer Dinwiddie and Lamarcus Aldridge too.
Are you forgetting LaMarcus Aldridge clowning the Lakers and signing with the Spurs?  Oh wait that doesn't fit the narrative my bad
Crazy thing is this team was a fluke disease away from having LaMarcus Aldridge playing significant minutes at the 5 with Blake taking the rest... Sheesh.. it'd be a wrap for this championship.
"Thanks for clarifying. We are all entitled to our opinions, for sure. With that being said, some Blazer‚Äôs fans did that to Lamarcus Aldridge and I also thought it was super corny and they needed to get over it. But whatever. Each to their own."
LaMarcus Aldridge? They get a good post player and defender whose able to spread the floor.
"I agree. One of the most striking examples of this I'm familiar with was the Lamarcus Aldridge era in Portland. LMA was consistently inefficient as an individual, which isn't surprising. His bread and butter for point generation was long 2s generated through post ups. Those are the shots teams are desperate to get out of their repertoire. The Blazers were also consistently one of the most efficient offenses in the league during that time. The ability to get a 40% shot out of even bad or broken possessions is valuable to the team, even if the state sheet looks like a guy had a bad TS% personally. Unless you're going to turn the ball over, someone has to take a shot every trip down the court. And, like you say, guys getting doubled and trapped generates open looks."
LaMarcus Aldridge pulled that same shit
Anthony davis should be eating the suns i dont understand this guy he just wants to settle for jumpshots. He plays like lamarcus aldridge now
Prime Lamarcus Aldridge
"I wouldn‚Äôt love melo if I were a nuggets fan, but it could‚Äôve been worse imho. Lamarcus ‚ÄúI want to be the greatest blazers of all time‚Äù Aldridge played coy with his intentions, resulting in him simply leaving the blazers in free agency. At least Nuggets fans got something back for Melo. And Jamal Murray is awesome."
LaMarcus Aldridge was prolific at this as well
"I‚Äôm just waiting for this to happen:  *I am a real American, fight for the rights of every man, I am a real American, fight for what‚Äôs right, fight for your life!*  Then LaMarcus Aldridge shows up and drops a 40/20 in one half."
wait till you hear about LaMarcus Aldridge.
LaMarcus Aldridge would be proud.
Just Ja paying tribute to the recently retired LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Yeah we're talking about guys like Lamarcus Aldridge getting in. He should be one of the headliners of the Hall of Very Good, but by the standards we've set he'll almost definitely make the HOF"
"These Warriors remind me of Portland when Lillard was running shit with two popcorn dispensers, the mascot and Lamarcus Aldridge."
Lamarcus Aldridge nods proudly.
"They traded LaMarcus Aldridge and a second round pick for Tyrus Thomas on draft night 2006, that's about as embarrassing as it gets."
"Yeah no issues him making it, but surprised he didn‚Äôt have to wait as long as Webber. 11 straight is impressive but it‚Äôs all in the East. He only made 1 All-NBA‚Ä¶ Webber made 5 All NBAs. Lamarcus Aldridge (also will make HOF eventually) eventually also had 5 All NBAs. Neither Cwebb and Aldridge have the volume of all star appearances being mostly in Western Conf."
Lamarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge has entered the chat  https://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/article/LaMarcus-Aldridge-to-build-a-house-specifically-6422021.php
"I think Dirk is still the greatest Euro player for now. He had one of the greatest finals runs of all time in 2011, just look at the teams and players he beat in that year alone:  1st round: beats a young but talented Brandon Roy and Lamarcus Aldridge.      2nd round : Sweeps the Lakers who were the defending champs and Kobe, Pau and still in prime Bynum.           3rd round: Beats a young Durant, Westbrook and Harden, who went to the finals the next year.         Finals: beats the Miami heat with LeBron, Dwade and chris Bosh.           This is just a single playoff run, over his career he has beaten Duncan and Garnett, the other great PFs of his era, he's beaten Steve Nash and the suns who had an all star PF in amare stoudamire."

"If we're trying to win one game with the peak versions of the player during their tenure with the team (as opposed to ranking their whole careers), Portland is really sneaky good with a bunch of players whose careers were injury plagued.  Dame, Clyde Drexler, Brandon Roy, Lamarcus Aldridge, Bill Walton.  Bench: Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, Zach Randolph, Terry Porter, CJ McCollum, Cliff Robinson."
"When Oden was drafted by Portland the GM at the time (Kevin Pritchard) hinted that Minnesota had offered KG for the pick.  Forget Durant for a minute and imagine a Portland team running Brandon Roy, Lamarcus Aldridge and KG for a few years."
The Blazers are not going to build a contender lol. It's been like six seasons since LaMarcus Aldridge left and they've yet to put a legitimate star next to him. It's over.
"I don't think there's a solid, hard rule like that. For example BI = Brandon Ingram and LMA = LaMarcus Aldridge are more recognizable than if you tried to refer to Giannis and Steph as GA and SC.  Some players' names sound best referring to them as a first name, sometimes last name, sometimes entire name, sometimes acronym, sometimes first-initial-last-name format like DRose, DWade and KLove. The other guy was just using acronyms for players that have never had one before and that caused the confusion."
"Huh?? Forwards were absolutely stacked in the 00s. All NBA are two forward slots, not just PF.  Dirk, Duncan, LeBron, Garnett, Pau, Stoudemire, Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Webber, Karl Malone, Barkley, Peja Stojakovic, Wallace, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, Tracy McGrady (Houston he was a SF and was All NBA as a Forward), Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Zach Randolph etc.. all competing for All NBA honors.   Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."
We should ask Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge what they think about it.
"Lol a 2018 all-star? You mean like Lamarcus Aldridge, Victor Oladipo, Al Horford, John Wall, Demarcus Cousins, and Kevin Love? How is being a 2018 all-star relevant at this point?"
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
He doesn‚Äôt need everything. Just give him anything... Lamarcus Aldridge is the best player he‚Äôs ever played beside and he was out of his prime by his third year in SA
"LaMarcus Aldridge left so Portland could ‚Äúbuild‚Äù around Dame, and this is what they‚Äôve built to date. I know drafting and scouting are somewhat dice rolls, but look at everyone who has risen in the west post-Heatles.  Utah, Denver, both LA teams, and even GSW all seem better poised than Portland moving forward, with Phoenix very likely in that tranche also (let‚Äôs see what they do with contracts but still). Dame may well have a markedly better chance at the Finals by joining half if not any one of those teams, and alternatively the East is softer if he goes to a contender over there.  I absolutely love watching Dame. I‚Äôd surely be upset to lose him if I were a Blazers fan, but at least half of that is frustration with the FO. Reggie Miller isn‚Äôt walking through that door."
"Well, I thought Portland's deal was fair to the Pacers.  Pritchard's reputation in Portland was that of a draft guru.    He wanted CP3 back in 2005.  He was the one who traded Sebastian Telfair and Tyrus Thomas for Brandon Roy and Lamarcus Aldridge.    Then, he found Nic Batum and made a trade to ensure the Spurs did not acquire him.  So, seeing as how he also recognized the talent of Dipo and Sabonis, it's not out of the question that he could have spotted either Bam, OG, Collins, and/or Mitchell if given the opportunity."
Dude I‚Äôve been through the whole Lamarcus Aldridge saying he wants to be the best blazer of all time and then leaving the next year.  I know words are meaningless with some people. But Dame is all about loyalty   It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll add you to the list of people I need to say I told you so I‚Äôm about 5 years
[\[Sylvander\] Lamarcus Aldridge is headed to the Heat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mdbb5s/sylvander_lamarcus_aldridge_is_headed_to_the_heat/)  Same dude btw ü§£ he's the Arye Abraham of the heat sadly
&gt; LaMarcus Aldridge was always the scapegoat that season  Probably because he was having an abysmal playoff run up until that point and that 61-21 Spurs team got taken to 6 by a far inferior Grizzlies team
Exactly this.      I remember LaMarcus Aldridge was always the scapegoat that season and then he dropped 34/12 in that 40 point game 6 closeout win on the road without Kawhi to help the Spurs advance to the WCF
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
Thats because they have a midrange king on a max contract and LaMarcus Aldridge before that. It‚Äôs smart to do what your players are good at. Pop also promised Aldridge that he wouldnt have to change his game.
"I‚Äôm sorry. I gave Pietrus some serious consideration.  But I currently have him behind LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Ron Artest, Elton Brand, Tyson Chandler, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, and JJ Barrera for the 2000‚Äôs. Maybe if I have time, I‚Äôll do a deep dive on his film and see if he has a case for moving ahead of those guys."

Biased but okc vs Philadelphia January 2019 and okc vs Spurs January 2019 (lamarcus Aldridge career high)
"One of the narratives that never gets discussed is that when Durant signed with the Warriors, he turned down the Spurs who had just won 67 games and had a top 10 SRS rating all time. They could have won 70 games but they took off the end of the season and dropped 3 of their last 5.   The roster featured an aging big 3 who were all still highly effective in 25 MPG type roles, a budding superstar in Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge at his peak and a cast of role players that included David West, Patty Mills, Danny Green and Boris Diaw. One of the deepest rosters the NBA has ever seen and a suffocating defense.   In terms of setting himself up for easy championships, Durant made the right call. All healthy and no drama and GSW is going for their 5th straight right now. SAS was going to have a lot of churn on its roster in any event and were clearly near the end of their window. But going to SAS would have probably still meant a couple of rings, Kawhi might have stuck around, and would have forever changed how we perceive Durant."
"You're really telling me size wasn't the clinching factor in sealing Tyson Chandler a place on two of the greatest teams of all time? There were more skilled big men at the time. LaMarcus Aldridge, Zach Randolph, Al Jefferson, Kenyon Martin could all score better than Tyson Chandler and guard the paint reasonably well given the rest of the talent around. What stood out was Chandler's size and Kevin Love's dominant rebounding."
I‚Äôm a huge Dame fan but people acting like he isn‚Äôt a little flawed as a player based on size and defense has been an interesting part of this summer.  I still wonder what coins have been if Dame/CJ/Batum/Lamarcus Aldridge/Lopez/Wesley Matthews may have done as a core had LMA not wanted to move close to home in Texas. I feel like he gave up on a contending team and played with an also-ran in the Spurs.
"Once again, LaMarcus Aldridge. Dame was not the #1 on his team the first two times he went to the playoffs. A 6'11  All Star Power Forward was. Then he got a 20ppg player with CJ. AD had Holiday, Evans, and Gordon as his supporting cast for the longest time. Jrue was good but also young, Evans and Gordon and even AD got injured early on. AD's last season in NOLA was a wash.   That's a good combination if you want to make the playoffs year after year but never win a championship. I'm betting on the guy who's bigger than his opponents, who can pass over, shoot over, dunk over their opponents and who can also defend their opponents."
"The 2016 spurs were so weird. They had a lineup consisting of Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green, Patty Mills, etc. and didn't even finish first in their conference with 67 wins."
To save millions of dollars. Lamarcus Aldridge gave up $7.25 million when the spurs didn't even want to play him anymore. Blake Griffin gave up $13.3 million. That's a ton of money to save when having the player there benefits nobody.
Montae Ellis - Agent Zero - Brandon Knight - Eric Bledsoe - Josh Smith - Lamarcus Aldridge
"&gt;if you got replaced by someone at work you'd ask yourself why    She didn't ask nothing! She assumed it was a diversity hire when, CVs Resumes and LinkedINs aside, Taylor is a better host! No disrespect needed - Nichols is good on the jump where she can use her sources and knowledge on back and forth. Sometimes the host don't need all that! That's the truth about this job!     In NBA terms, the spurs sat Aldridge - who had far more experience at being an NBA forward - in favor of Poeltl. Did Lamarcus cry about a white man replacing him? Or did he understand that SAS needed defense more than offense at the 5?!! It's really that simple and no race card needed to be played! She got axed because she was not as good! That's facts."
"Our offer for LaMarcus Aldridge was Kemba Walker this yr. 2 years ago would have been the only time to make that trade. 3 years ago we were in the playoffs and lost to the Nuggets in 7 games and easily could have won that series‚Ä¶4 years ago we had Kawhi and Aldridge and were a title threat.  2 of our current starters are from the Kawhi trade. The other is DeRozan who you keep writing off as getting nothing for, we may re-sign  him, or we may sign and trade him.   That value isn‚Äôt sunk at all. The Spurs haven‚Äôt really made any objective mistakes, have drafted well, have developed those picks even better, and have made 0 bad contracts w tons of cap space.  That isn‚Äôt failing at all, if people prefer to suck and rebuild that way, fine. But that doesn‚Äôt make people that disagree with you stupid or wrong."
"You got crossposted and roasted by r/NBASpurs but this take is spot on. Turns out treading water for 4 years straight, not trading any assets to rebuild more effectively and feeding 35 year old Lamarcus Aldridge 20 shots a night is not a winning recipe"
"Replace with an unretired and medically cleared Lamarcus Aldridge. CP3 has haters too, why not Dame? Don‚Äôt need a classic PG with Jokic anyway (as if this is real)."
First Team All-‚ÄúGet This Man A Ring‚Äù:  PG - Chris Paul  SG - Derrick Rose  SF - Paul George  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Giannis  Second Team:  PG - Russell Westbrook  SG - James Harden  SF - Jimmy Butler  PF - Blake Griffin  C - Lamarcus Aldridge

I'm thinking more like Nets legend LaMarcus Aldridge
"Worthy's personal accolades are comparable to Lamarcus Aldridge and had the benefit of playing with Magic, who made Byron Scott play like a borderline all-star"
"Note: This one kinda got away from me lol. Not tryna rant at you in particular.  I understand the argument for ""diluted"" and get why people think just anyone can get in, I just disagree vehemently. I'd rather a few edge cases squeak by than actual deserving players not get in.   I absolutely hate the way Baseball and Football do it. I'm not as well versed on either, as NBA is by far my favorite, but I still don't like what I see.   MLB just feels snobbish about the whole ""first ballot v third ballot"" and ""doesn't deserve to be unanimous"" kinda bullshit gatekeeping. Its fine if you gotta talk yourself into a guy getting in, but any system where voting against surefire dudes like Ken Griffey Jr for any reason is fucking bullshit.  And I absolutely loath how the NFL just doesn't give a shit about certain positions, an entire phase of the game (special teams), and certain franchises. Its is fucking absurd that a Kicker has to be the GOAT to get considered past the 60s. Fuck punters entirely despite them being essential to every team. Its absurd that the Bengals only have one Hall of Famer, Anthony Munoz, and he had to be the literal GOAT at his position to be considered. The sports been around for over 100 years and over 26,000 players have played, but there's like 300 guys in total (not counting coaches and such)? Only 300 guys have been great? That's about 1.1% of players. Nevermind the sport is so punishing that careers are constantly cut short by the nature of the game, supreme edge cases like Terrell Davis or Calvin Murphy for insane peaks, but most guys don't. Start out great and some guy comes down hard on your knee one day? Sucks to suck, bro. You just weren't that good. And I think its just gotten harder and harder over time because people put these guys on pedestals and don't like that other guys are maybe as good as their childhood heroes so the bar has to get raised just a little bit more for each generation and I feel like that's malarkey.   Conversely, the NBA has been around for 75 years, about like 4.5k players have suited up and like 200 guys are in the Hall. That's like 4.4% are in. So yeah 4x the rate of the NFL, but its not like that much higher. I like that Basketball celebrates guys who were great in their time. If Joe Johnson is ""diluting"" the esteem of the Basketball Hall, then I'd like to know how other sports aren't. What even constitutes ""dilution""?  Does YA Tittle being in the NFL hall take away from Johnny Unitas? Johnny U has 12k more passing yards and 80 more touchdowns, 4 more probowls and 2 more All NFL nods with just one more year played. Same era, contemporaries for a time, does that constitute dilution? Where's Len Dawson fit into this? How many people that talk about Joe Namath know about Sonny Jurgenson? Calvin Johnson played 9 seasons, had 11,619 yards, 83 TDs, and 731 Receptions. Art Monk played 16 seasons, had 12,721 yards, 68 TDs, and 940 receptions. Randy Moss played 14 seasons, had 15,292 yards, 156 TDs, and 982 receptions. One of them sticks out pretty from the others, does that mean the others don't deserve it? Would adding Chad Johnson who played 11 seasons, had 11,059 yards, 67 TDs, and 766 receptions really stand out as an outlier? Its fine if so, but where's the line? Ocho had about as much yards as Calvin with only a little extra games played and certainly less consistent QB play. He's got the same amount of TDs as Monk in significantly less games played. I think most people agree Chad isn't quite Hall worthy, but his stats aren't particularly out of whack from other guys that are in. Lynn Swann played 9 seasons, had 5,462 yards, 51 TDs, and 336 receptions, basically half of Chad's stats, but he was on a Dynasty team so he's in. Would him getting in really throw things out of whack that bad? Is that diluted?  Is Joe Johnson really watering things down that bad? 7 all stars, 20k points with another 5k rebounds and assists? There's few guys that hit that mark and didn't make the hall and plenty more who didn't hit 20k and are in. Only 50 players have done it so far (including ABA stats, 46 if you exclude). Chris Paul will be next if he plays next year, 22 points to go. The only ones who aren't in the Hall are guaranteed guys that are still going or recently retired and are surefire. The only two who hit that mark and aren't in the hall Tom Chambers (4x all star and people debate on him getting in) and Antawn Jamison (2x All Star, Hall of Very good). Lamarcus Aldridge was 50 short, he's another 7x All Star that will likely be in. Is Joe Johnson really muddying any waters here? 7x All Stars really isn't easy to do either.  There are certainly tiers of greatness and those tiers are generally understood by how well these names live in memory. Some will go by the wayside, but that doesn't mean they weren't something in their day or undeserving. Joe Johnson will probably be one of the names that doesn't immediately jump to mind down the line, but he was a baller in his day."
"Ryan McDonough took over when the team was struggling to stay competitive and relevant and went all in on a roster that widely exceeded expectations. He thought the Suns were closer than they actually were and then played his hand by bringing in an over the hill Tyson Chandler in efforts to lure LaMarcus Aldridge. That didn‚Äôt work and the team came back to earth the following season. By then it was too late. Losing took its toll on the locker room and we went from bad to laughably bad. When it was clear that it was time to move on, he spent far too long drafting raw prospects that didn‚Äôt have a chance on a dysfunctional team.   Devin Booker became who he is not because of the Suns, but rather, in spite of the Suns.    I say this and I mean every last word of it. Ryan McDonough was one of the worst GMs in the history of the league."
"Okay but then explain:  * Dwight Howard * Lamarcus Aldridge  * DeMar DeRozan * Ibaka * Westbrook  * Paul George  * Harden * Hayward  * Whiteside   Basically Kawhi, LeBron, and Carmelo picked big cities in the last decade and that‚Äôs it.   Most of the time big cities are leverage. Most players re-signed with their team or went where they had a shot at the title"
Not exactly.  The better one actually took a lesser amount to keep his twin in phoenix but then phoenix traded the lesser twin to try to sign lamarcus aldridge.  This pissed of the better twin and he turned into a locker room cancer and was soon traded.  But they were assholes their whole time in phoenix.  Always something off the court and big egos in the locker room
"4 superstars plus next year‚Äôs Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, and any other vet that wants a free ring"
"I understand that, remember Lamarcus Aldridge said he wanted to be the best blazer of all time right before he left us the next season.  So I know words are meaningless, but that‚Äôs why I know for sure Damian Lillard is different. Not only his words but his actions too. He literally makes loyalty his number one priority even if it comes at personal costs. You can look back to HS and College, to his trainers, coaches, inner circle, hell even his girl is the same one since College. The dude is, and I quote ‚ÄúLoyal to the soil‚Äù"

Remember when LaMarcus Aldridge played for Portland
"At least the rockets had Morey as a GM, he brought in CP3 and they woulda made the finals if he didn‚Äôt get hurt against the warriors. All the blazers have done in Dame‚Äôs prime is lose LaMarcus Aldridge and bring in guys like Kanter, RoCo (one year), Seth Curry (one year), and Melo. Not even a comparison."
"Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge"
"Picture it: Portland panic sells on Billups and hires the next available guy, LaMarcus Aldridge. It's tense at first but eventually he fixes Dame's trapping problem and Dame takes the scoring title averaging 68 from midrange, never shoots another 3 but everybody loves the beautiful interior game again.  If he needs a 3, he dumps it off to the corner coach."
Remember that game Zubac got run off the court by LaMarcus Aldridge? 5 fouls in 4 fucking minutes. Absolutely pathetic lol.
same but Andrea Bargnani over LaMarcus Aldridge instead
"Just based on his NBA career? No, he wouldn't make it. Is his career on a non-Spurs team better than LaMarcus Aldridge? I am not so sure."
"Not winning this year meant that LeVert and Allen (and LaMarcus Aldridge, and potentially Spencer Dinwiddie) don't get rings as members of the Nets ü•∫ the saddest development of being eliminated"
Probably because The Lopez brothers are both some of the best at boxing out in the league. Giannis rebounds shot up when they acquired Brook. And I remember when the Blazers got Robin LaMarcus Aldridge went from like 8.5 rebounds for his career then he went up to 11 with Robin. Boxing out is a lost art

"Shit, controversial, but RC Buford since we got lamarcus Aldridge."
Plus LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Dirk also didn't play a Portland team missing LaMarcus Aldridge (Lakers - Anthony Davis), a Lakers team missing Pau Gasol (Denver - Jamal Murray) or a Thunder team missing Kevin Durant (Clippers - Kawhi). On top of all that, Paul may get to the finals and avoid the Nets or the 76ers. Milwaukee or Atlanta, no disrespect to either, would probably be one of the easier finals opponents in the last 15 years."
"To be clear, I don't think any of us are legitimately referring to the FO when we're talking about ""The Heat"" - we're talking about the fans here on r/NBA. I don't recall the Heat FO ever coming out and saying much of anything about the potential of a Harden trade, let alone saying they wouldn't pull the trigger because of Herro. It was your fans that were saying that stupid shit.  The Nets lost because of injuries, let's be real. Dinwiddie season-ending injury 3 games in already fucked their guard depth, LaMarcus Aldridge retired, Kyrie out for the series, Harden grade 2 hamstring that clearly killed his on-court performance when he tried to return early, Joe Harris straight up forgetting how to shoot - that team absolutely fucking ***collapsed*** and that's not an indictment on any one player and certainly doesn't support the argument that Herro, Simmons, or whoever is more valuable than Harden."
"Lillard had prime Wesley Matthews, prime Batum and prime Lamarcus Aldridge and a whole slew of really good vets like Chris Kaman to help along  the way. Lillard is great and has been his whole career but stop this bro. Lillard did a lot for those teams in his early years, carry is a stretch"
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
"Spencer dimwiddie, Lamarcus Aldridge had to retire, and harden wasn‚Äôt healthy. And obviously kyrie."
"Well all these guys had plenty of rest. Harden maybe should have rested even more to prevent that hamstring injury coming back. Kyrie was stepped on to roll his ankle. That not a conditioning fault on his part. And KD was clearly fine after his rest.  Look at the minutes played on the bench...ya 3 max contract guys getting enough rest and staying healthy is absolutely all you need for the playoffs. Not to mention the bench for the Nets was quite good, Jeff green, Claxton, Shamet, Bruce Brown, hell the nets should‚Äôve had Lamarcus Aldridge if he didn‚Äôt have medical complications."
Lot of players with the extra 2 letters in their names lmao  DeMarcus Cousins  DeAndre Jordan  Deandre Ayton  De'Andre Hunter  DeAndre' Bembry  Devonte' Graham  De'Aaron Fox  LaMelo Ball  LaMarcus Aldridge  LeBron James  probably more I don't know
"**""You fucking need me!""**  - LaMarcus Aldridge"
"Reports were saying the Celtics were looking for suitors all year for Kemba. We tried trading him for Lamarcus Aldridge, who at the time was washed and about to leave the league."
??? Bowen expressly gave his blessing to both RC Buford and the SA Express News  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13228013/bruce-bowen-allows-lamarcus-aldridge-wear-retired-no-12-jersey-san-antonio-spurs
"Idk about ""unretiring"", but Bruce Bowen gave LaMarcus Aldridge permission to wear his retired #12 for the Spurs"
"You‚Äôre saying lamarcus Aldridge like he wasn‚Äôt a 5 time all nba player and 7 time all star who left for SA in the prime of his career.  And you, yourself, even named Lebron to Cleveland.   How about you name me all the times a small market has actively created cap space and a strong supporting cast while aggressively pursuing free agents?  I bet you‚Äôll really struggle to find many of them because they don‚Äôt bother to put themselves in that position to begin with"
Example(S)?  you named gordon hayward and lamarcus aldridge....  Like..
"it took the Lakers 22 years to sign a star Free Agent after Shaq in ‚Äò96. they didn‚Äôt get a meeting with Durant. LaMarcus Aldridge went to San Antonio over them.  the Knicks are the biggest market in the league, they‚Äôve been bad for the better part of the 2000‚Äôs and the biggest name they‚Äôve signed is Amare."
"I mean they beat a 48 win Trail Blazers team with Lamarcus Aldridge, swept the returning champs with Kobe and Pau, beat a really solid young thunder team, and then capped it off by beating a consensus top two player of all time, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in the finals. You can‚Äôt ask for much more than that."

Oh and LaMarcus Aldridge played for the Nets as recently as April and is now considering a return to the NBA after retiring.
Nets also have Steve Nash and LaMarcus Aldridge
LaMarcus Aldridge Oreos
Warriors fans went after LaMarcus Aldridge because he put his foot like 3 inches in front of where KD jumped from and his toe brushed Aldridge's foot. What Klay did was far far worse than that and he did it multiple times in a single game.  It's hilarious to me how blatantly fans bias shows when it comes to those stepping under fouls.

LaMarcus Aldridge was 15/9/2 blocks as a 1-and-done Freshman at Texas.  Shelden Williams was 19/11/4 blocks as a 4 year Senior at Duke.  Brandon Roy was 26/7/5 assists as a 4 year Senior at Washington.  Adam Morrison was 28/5/2 assists as a 3 year Junior at Gonzaga. Keep in mind that Gonzaga's level of competition in the WCC is significantly lower and tends to inflate individual stats. Not that these numbers aren't amazing.  I just don't see how you look at those numbers and tell me that Brandon Roy doesn't look like the most accomplished college player in that group. Maybe Shelden Williams would be 1st? Maybe you're more impressed by Adam Morrison's slight edge in scoring? But I don't see how the heck anyone picks Aldridge as anything other than the 4th best college player there.
"Brandon Roy is someone I mention because he went 6th, ahead of All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge, ahead of multiple high upside busts. But Roy was viewed, at the time anyway, as a can't miss starting quality player. He exceeded that obviously.  Very similar to what people were saying about Buddy Hield coming out of the draft. Who coincidentally also went 6th.  It's worth mentioning that NCAA player of the year winners have often amounted to very little, or sometimes nothing, in the NBA. Winners have included Tyler Hansbrough, Obi Toppin, Frank Mason, Frank Kaminsky, Jalen Brunson, etc. Lots and lots of guys that had zero business going 1st overall or even all that close to it.    Reddish has great shooting form and I always saw it as more of a decision making problem personally. I think he's going to figure it out and shoot a solid at least 34% eventually. He shoots over 80% from the FT line there's no way his 3 point percentage doesn't improve eventually."
"Brandon Roy, Lamarcus aldridge, and Greg oden."
"By the numbers (nba.com tracking stats), the five best midrange shooters last season (min. 3 attempts per game):  Kyrie Irving (54.4% on 3.8 attempts)  Chris Paul (51.6% on 5.5 attempts)  Nikola Jokic (51.5% on 3.3 attempts)  LaMarcus Aldridge (51.2% on 5.0 attempts)  Kevin Durant (50.6% on 5.1 attempts)  Honestly, that list makes a lot of sense‚Äî some other guys you'd expect to see were pretty close, like Devin Booker (48.6%) or  CJ McCollum (48.9%). Joel Embiid also had an incredible season from midrange last year (49.1% on 5.6 attempts, 5th most in the league), but the biggest surprise for me was that Kawhi only shot 44.7% from midrange‚Äî I always thought he was a low-50s kind of guy, but the nba.com numbers don't seem to back that up even in previous seasons.  ^(Surprising no one, the league leader in midrange volume this year was Russell Westbrook, who shot a blistering 38.1% on 6.1 attempts. He's #1 in shot attempts, but #11 in shots made.)"
"When your name is LaMelo Ball, the only thing you can do is ball. His name is a combination of LaMarcus Aldridge and Carmelo Anthony, and his last name is ball."
Drummond was being guarded by Lamarcus Aldridge who thought his heart was gonna pop out of his chest that night
Portland Lamarcus Aldridge
Ben Simmons?  Rudy Gobert?  Zach Lavine?  Blake Griffin(in DETROIT?) D'Angelo Russel? ANDRE DRUMMOND? John Wall?  Demarcus Cousins?  De'Andre Jordan?  Melo?  Isiah Thomas? Kevin Love? Demar Derozan? Lamarcus Aldridge?
It still shouldn't have been that close. The spurs didn't even have LaMarcus Aldridge for this game. Rockets choked.
definitely the answer is LaMarcus Aldridge   also CJ McCollum   De(Mar +Rozan)
"Paul George, Vucevic, Myles Turner, LaMarcus Aldridge, Boogie"
You would always see LaMarcus Aldridge doing the same lol
"I mean the iso ball matchup or star vs star matchup is gonna be mostly forwards, who aren't as fast compared to the other stars, so yeah there's gonna be slower paced games.     2000s was like golden era of forwards like Duncan, KG, Dirk, Stoudemire, Brand, Jermaine O'Neal, Rasheed Wallace, Rashard Lewis (yeah he's mostly SF but he's 6'10"" and great compliment to the Dwight Magics at the 4), Chris Webber, Chris Bosh, and early Lamarcus Aldridge."
How that wasn't the end of Pax right then and there I'll never know.  Trading LaMarcus Aldridge for Tyrus Thomas and Victor Khryapa.
When Philly traded for Butler I think thats a better example of a team trying to build like this.  You have young talent on cheap deals then you have to sign a max FA or pull off a blockbuster trade.  Thing is Max free Agents have to want to play for you in order to sign.  But look no one wanted to play with the Pels even with Zion.  So in order to make it work they have to negotiate a trade and thats going to be tough.  I think if Lillard wanted out the Pels might be able to put together the best offer but you never know.  The Celtics tried to build that way around Brown/Tatum but its a little different because they were drafting talent with another teams picks so they were able to try to be competitive AND get top picks.  They were adding those young players on great deals to a core that was already very competitive.  Not getting a good young player THEN trying to immediately build around them.  Portland maybe during Dame's Early career tried to build a contender with Dame on a rookie deal but then Aldridge left and you know the rest.  Crazy thing is Portland could have resigned Lamarcus AND still had a path to create another max cap slot.    I always wish Kawhi and Aldridge teamed up in Portland instead of San Antonio with Dame and CJ both on rookie deals.  Alas it was not to be.

"You got it right.  Passing is pure vision accuracy and well-timed execution of throwing the basketball.  Playmaking is the ability to generate advantageous scoring opportunities for your teammates.   Bad passers can be good playmakers because of their great scoring ability and defenses collapsing other teammate‚Äôs defenders onto them.   Good passers can be bad playmakers because of their poor scoring ability and inability to draw defenders away from their teammates.  I worry to ever label a player good or bad and get into a argument of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not that bad he‚Äôs only kinda bad‚Äù where we‚Äôre splitting hairs, but let‚Äôs charge forward anyways and make 2 examples that nobody will be upset by  Good passer/bad playmaker = Facundo Campozzo  Bad passer/good playmaker = LaMarcus Aldridge"
The 2014 Houston Rockets would like a word. LaMarcus Aldridge was a problem. The 2015 or maybe 2016 Oklahoma City Thunder also agree
Lamarcus Aldridge. One of the most boring and uninspired NBA ‚Äúall stars‚Äù ever. EVER! He‚Äôs so bad that it actually bothers me that he ever made an all-star game ahead of players that were actually worth a damn.
The year Kawhi Leonard had Tim Duncan &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team.  Can someone tell me what **year** that was?
"2000 - 2007 Dirk is much more athletic than KP. But not only that, Dirk has better footwork, tighter handles, lower body strength, and a quick first step to get past most guards/wings/big men at that time -- something KP won't be able to do. Dirk in his first 7 years is more like a Giannis/Durant/Klay Thompson hybrid.  2008 - 2019 Dirk is more of a low-post, mid-range, stretch 5 kind of player like Anthony Davis/Carmelo Anthony/LaMarcus Aldridge. I think old-man Dirk is the best comparison to KP given how many injury and mobility issues he already suffered these past few years."
"If I'm right, it's Lamarcus Aldridge. Even he openly admitted he went there to get away from the media spotlight lmao."
"I feel like his impact will equate to what LaMarcus Aldridge would have been for the Nets, so probably not much in terms of winning far out of your prime.  But maybe he can have a Lakers Rondo kind of impact, hit some clutch shots, be valuable in key stretches, contribute a lot in a positive way, so it could be good for him. Rondo already had championship so obviously it would do more overall for Melo. At the very least he would not retire a CP3."
LaMarcus Aldridge?
The bar should be lamarcus Aldridge or Paul George
The bar is much lower than LaMarcus Aldridge   Calvin Murphy is in the hall
the bar is likely closer to LaMarcus Aldridge
"You're downplaying getting Simmons on a small market team like the Spurs.  It never happens outside of a draft.  The biggest player we've ever traded or signed was Lamarcus Aldridge.  Ben Simmons is a better player than LA was.  Even if Ben doesn't develop a shot in the Spurs system, he'd turn our team into a playoff team immediately.  The next 3 years of picks is absolutely worth that."
"Yep. his peak can get overrated by some Mavs fans, he was elite, but even at his peak he was a consensus top 3 guy at best. Even his MVP season, I think most people would say that Kobe and LeBron were more dominant.   But at the same time, you have instagram/twitter users that think he was some slow unathletic fadeaway specialist his whole career akin to LaMarcus Aldridge. He doesn't quite get the pendulum treatment that a guy like Kobe gets (ranked top 3 all time, or top 15 depending on where you ask), but he definitely can get falsely attributed things or exagerrated truths (i.e. the '11 finals run becomes more and more Dirk was prime MJ and everyone else on the team was a rec-league player, or that he was the most athletic player ever when young) or he can just completely be disregarded and reduced to a spot up one trick pony who was a turnstile on defense his whole career."
They both make it   They have the career stats   Joe Johnson 20k points 5k assists 5k rebounds   LaMarcus Aldridge 20k points 8k rebounds    They have the accolades   Joe Johnson 7x allstar 1x All-nba   LaMarcus Aldridge 7x allstar 5  All-nba    They have the peak seasons    Joe Johnson 07 season 25 ppg 4 rpg 4 apg or 08 season 22 ppg 5 rpg 6 apg     LaMarcus Aldridge 14 season 23 ppg 10 rpg 3 apg or 15 season 23 ppg 11 rpg 2 apg     They have really good 5 year primes    Joe Johnson 06-10   22 ppg 4 rpg 6 apg     LaMarcus Aldridge 11-15   22 ppg 10 rpg 2 apg     Neither were bad in the playoffs either   Aldridge is a career 21 and 9 playoff performer and Joe Johnson is a career 16/4/3 playoff performer    I think it's pretty cut and dry They are hall of famers
"I mean, if you're talking about isolating one single position, then it's way, way more rare for the best player to be the *second* pick.    KD, and maybe LaMarcus Aldridge are the only two examples in the last 20 years.    Meanwhile you've got Yao Ming, LeBron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, AD, and arguably John Wall and Zion who are #1 picks who turned out to be best in the draft."
"He literally wasn't honest about what happened. He was clearly fishing for a doctor to side with him. You seriously believe the Spurs would sabotage the long-term health of a future HOF that they groomed for that long? Had he just said ""I want to leave"" the spurs would have 100% respected those wishes. Look how we just handled LaMarcus Aldridge. They worked hard to accommodate a good trade for him because he did right by the org.    You clearly don't have much knowledge of these events and that's okay, just admit that. Giving me half-baked conjecture on events that I know are true does not convince me of anything lol"
"Speaking of Tyson Chandler, signed him to a fat contract and burned bridges with Marcus Morris a year after he and his brother signed an extension thinking they'll be playing together long term. The goal was to lure LaMarcus Aldridge here which didn't pan out. In the worst way..."
"Yeah, and the Spurs who played more than 10 minutes in that game were LaMarcus Aldridge, Jonathon Simmons, Danny Green, Pau Gasol, Patty Mills, Dejounte Murray, Kyle Anderson, and Manu Ginobili. Ginobili was 39, Gasol was 37, and Murray was 20. That may be slightly better than what Houston had, but not by enough that they should have lost by almost 40 points."
Lamarcus Aldridge had a pretty ugly exit from Portland
Using DFW area at large:  * PG: Cade Cunningham * SG: Grant Hill * SF: Julius Randle * PF: LaMarcus Aldridge * C: Chris Bosh  Very tall lineup.
"As much as I despise Il Mago, I agree that it was a defensible pick.  The only clear alternative at the top that was worthy of #1 was LaMarcus Aldridge.  Aldridge had a very good career, but was a very typical big man that happened to pan out.  Bargs was more of an anomaly with rare skills, making him more intriguing and probably having the higher ceiling.  Just like you said, his first year was very promising-it seemed like every game, he pulled out some tantalizing move that you never saw 7 footers do.  Then as the years went on, we saw no real development, especially in his BBIQ and work ethic and he faded into obscurity.    In the years after, we drafted Demar, Jonas and T-Ross, though I'm probably forgetting a few others.  None of those were bad picks in the slightest."
"The Rockets lineup is for sure better, but so was the competition they faced. If you look at the collective SRS of all the teams both beat, Rockets are 1st all time with 23.96, while Mavericks are 6th all time with 18.46. Like I said, it was still an all time performance by both teams, but the Mavericks faced Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Batum their first round, while the Rockets faced Hornacek, Stockton, and Malone. The Mavericks admittedly had a tough second round, with prime Kobe, Gasol, and DPOY Arrest in the way, but the Lakers overachieved the previous year and Pau had one of the worst years of his prime in 2011, with a drop in scoring and trebs. On the other hand, the Rockets were up against a prime Charles Barkley leading the 59 win Suns, which was lesser, but nonetheless tough competition. For the third round, they faced three MVPs, but all well before their primes. They still were an extremely good team, but they weren't touching the 62 win Spurs, with an MVP David Robinson and a prime Dennis Rodman. Of course the Heat big 3 were better than the Magic, but Shaq was still averaging 25.7/10, Tim with 19.6/7.7, and Horact Grant with 13.7. The Magic made the finals and won 57, but they were still easily the worst team the Rockets faced. Both the Mavericks and Rockets both beat insurmountable odds, and the Mavericks had the harder finals, but the Rockets faced a much tougher west in a much tougher era (in my opinion)."
"Lebron‚Äôs path in 2016 in the East was never in doubt  Dirk beat the young Lamarcus Aldridge in Portland, the defending champions in the Lakers, the Westbrook/Durant/Ibaka Thunder, and finally the Lebron/Wade/Bosh Heat for the Finals"
"I think that not many fans could have preficted that Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge would have been on the buy-out market last year.  There's definitely going to be some names there this season, but as you said, Lakers (and Nets) are going to receive the first ringchaser applicant forms."

"&gt; Yeah but Kawhi wanted to be wined and dined by teams all over North America again  LaMarcus Aldridge met with the Lakers twice during his free agency, but ended up signing with the Spurs.  Can't fault the guy, he got 2 free trips to Los Angeles and 2 expensive dinners."
"Yeah but Deandre Jordan, Blake Griffin, KD, Harden, and Kyrie with Lamarcus Aldridge possibly off the bench or starting is incredible also."
I remember everyone was HYPE when LaMarcus Aldridge took a meeting with us in 2015 lmao
"That‚Äôs a fair point. I‚Äôm not lamarcus Aldridge so I can‚Äôt speak for him, I just wanted to point out as someone who has also been diagnosed with the exact same condition that it felt like an overreaction based on fear when he retired, which is totally valid, but this feels like a course correction after speaking with doctors and them telling him he‚Äôs at low risk."
"We all know he's considering the Lakers. Imagine telling someone in 2015 that you could have a starting lineup of Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and LaMarcus Aldridge on the same team. Fuck I hate super teams lmao"
New lakers legend Lamarcus Aldridge
BREAKING ESPN Sources: Lamarcus Aldridge signs one year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers
blake literally did it last year and so did lamarcus aldridge. kemba is from new york and giving up some money isnt out of the ordinary. Have you seen literally any buyout? Who the hell wants to be in okc?
I'm sorry are you calling LaMarcus Aldridge a legend?
Well according to Woj LaMarcus Aldridge is now considering a return to the NBA. He fit in beautifully with the Nets in the five games he played. He‚Äôs not exactly a tik protector but he‚Äôs huge and stretches the floor.
"Golden State and Milwaukee drafted stars‚Ä¶.and then surrounded them with the right talent! Other players saw what was building there and wanted to join!   I just said that I dont expect the Wiz to build the way the lakers can. DC drafted their star and what the fuck have they done? Bungled every asset until changing the front office. Guys want to play with Beal, but who would join a franchise that cant seem to get anything right?   Which is exactly what happened to the Lakers after Kobe. No one would come here until we fixed the front office. We could barely get a meeting with LaMarcus Aldridge!   Its more like a man has been homeless for years and once he finally saved up enough to get himself a place he decided the housing market was too risky."
I don‚Äôt think this is what you meant but in 2005 the Knicks traded two first round picks to the bulls (with some players) for Eddie Curry.   Those two picks became LaMarcus Aldridge and  Joakim Noah.
Nah.  Everyone still going to find a way to disrespect the Knicks.  They could win a championship and still talk about how that one pick they traded for Eddy Curry turned into LaMarcus Aldridge.
"I love how weird a lot the NBA community is lmao   When Bron, AD, and Russ team up, people said it ain‚Äôt a superteam . Then they add Ellington, Anthony, Dwight, Monk and other decent pieces with name value and all of a sudden they‚Äôre a super-team. I don‚Äôt get how those signings change your opinion  Exact same thing happened with the Nets last year. Harden, Kyrie, and KD team up and people are talking about their defense and how top heavy they are. Then they add Lamarcus Aldridge and they‚Äôre the greatest team of all time lol.   Just a useless observation I made (mostly on Twitter)"
Ok let me tell you how it typically works. Kemba is owed like 35 million per year for two years.   Okc agrees to pay him 25 million per year for two years. And then any contract he signs for those two years gets deducted from the amount okc has to pay. So if he signed for 8 million with the knicks okc would only have to pay him 17 million per year. That 10 million per year given up in the buyout is typically just gone   That‚Äôs what happened with Blake griffin and lamarcus Aldridge. It‚Äôs what has happened with every buyout I‚Äôve seen.
LaMarcus Aldridge is a forgotten one
"2016 Spurs  PG: Tony Parker / Andre Miller / Patty Mills SG: Manu Ginobili / Kevin Martin / Danny Green SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kyle Anderson / Rasual Butler PF: LaMarcus Aldridge / David West / Boris Diaw C: Tim Duncan / Boban Marjanovic / Matt Bonner  That‚Äôs one multi-MVP all-timer (Duncan)  A multi-DPOY and FMVP who can score 27 ppg and is a top-3 player in the playoffs (Kawhi)  Three multi All-NBA players (Ginobili, Parker, LMA)  One two-time all-star (West)  Three borderline all-stars (Andre Miller, Kevin Martin and Boris Diaw all had seasons where they were close to that level)  Two exceptional 3-and-D wings (Anderson and Danny Green)  For my money, this legitimately might be the best one ever. A starting lineup of All-NBA players plus that depth off the bench is just staggering. The weakest position is center but Duncan played nearly 40 MPG back then and LMA and West would be capable of filling in those minutes as well."
"Money doesn‚Äôt really matter to the Spurs. The most significant (in terms of a star, not their eventual impact on the team) free agent pickups they‚Äôve had in the last 20 years are LaMarcus Aldridge and Michael Finley. And the reason those guys came is holding a clipboard these days. So I honestly don‚Äôt see how they pull an All-NBA free agent at this point."
Exactly. I still remember that whole Lamarcus Aldridge fiasco too. Shit was embarrassing as a Laker fan.
LaMarcus Aldridge to the spurs.  Exception proves the rule ect ect
"Oh, so now we're moving the goal post from ""throwing the game"" to ""quitting on the team in the last game"".  Is it that hard to fathom that the dude just sucked. He thought he was better than he actually is. I don't see anyone accusing Michael Porter Jr for ""quitting on the team"" when he bricks 4 shots in the last 2 mins.  And yea, stars leaving in FA. With the team getting no assets in return, sucks. I agree. LaMarcus Aldridge fcked over Portland. KD fcked over OKC. Lebron has literally made a career out of cannibalizing every team he's been on. This is just the reality of modern NBA.  Celtics fans playing the victim card is hilarious. Do you guys not remember the whole reason why Kyrie was available in the first place? He was a locker room cancer in Cleveland. Have you guys not been following the shitshow in Brooklyn this season?  This isn't some Kyrie only hates Boston situation. This is just Kyrie being Kyrie lol."
"Definitely not a weird take, and I think the history over the past 5 or 6 years more than proves my point. Steph has never been in a position where he‚Äôs needed to carry a team since he has played with two or three other all-stars (including KD from 2017-19, a top two player in the NBA) since he became a superstar, except for this last year when Klay was injured (only one all star teammate, cry me a river). Dame has only had CJ as his best teammate, a man who‚Äôs never even sniffed an All-Star berth.   And while we‚Äôre on the subject, the reason CJ scored well on high efficiency in the Pelicans series is BECAUSE dame was being double and triple teamed, and not in a way that‚Äôs like anything Steph has seen in the playoffs since Steph has always been surrounded by teammates that can either shoot or have high BBIQ, outside of this last year. NOLA‚Äôs fixation on Dame freed up space for CJ, the only other shot maker on the roster, to score points, but it wasn‚Äôt enough because nobody else stepped up.   I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs so hard for you to admit that Steph has benefited greatly from all-NBA level teammates in his career. GSW last year just showed that it‚Äôs extremely difficult to be a one-man show and carry a team to the playoffs, something that Dame has done every year since LaMarcus Aldridge left portland in 2015. Until I see Steph make similar runs on his own, I‚Äôm not going to change my opinion that he‚Äôs a ceiling raiser and not a floor raiser."
"Trying to bring Batum back, next up Lamarcus Aldridge."
"Not a Mavs fan so this could be wildly inaccurate, but I legit just think Dallas doesn't know how to pitch to free agents. They struggle with not just stars but even role players and it makes no sense unless their meetings are leaving players unimpressed  Like thinking back with Dwight Howard they did all this weird comic book Superman style stuff and that's not exactly the best image you wanna be presenting when your job is to sell your team is wanting to win at all costs. I remember with lamarcus Aldridge he said a similar thing about the Lakers, how when he went their for FA meetings their entire presentation was about Hollywood and shit and nothing bout hoops, and when he ragged on them in the media for that that's what pushed their franchise to overhaul the front office  Idk tho, just my thoughts looking outside in. Just makes no sense to me why they struggle so much getting anyone to sign"

"Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Lamarcus Aldridge"
"The bill of social media were mad at the Nets(even Steve Nash had to addresses this) because we got more big names, and it was Lamarcus who caused the anger. People were on the fence about Blake untill he showed he could play. Either way, there is some hypocrisy that goes on when it comes to big 3s. I was absolutely embarrassed at how social media made such a big fuss over Aldridge. People were talking about ‚ÄúNets got all these all stars/KD can‚Äôt win without a superteam‚Äù blah blah blah like these guys are in their primes lol. There were convos about Blake ‚Äúrobbing Detroit‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt the bulk of the hate. It was centered around the Nets adding more big names. Half these people weren‚Äôt even talking about contracts except the media but I‚Äôm not referring to them"
The problem is people were outraged when Lamarcus Aldridge signed too. There is some hypocrisy going on here.
I say yes because you can get roleplayers to sign for cheap to chase rings once you have enough superstar talent. The Nets got Blake and Lamarcus Aldridge for nothing last season.
You forgot Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge for KD
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
Lamarcus Aldridge needs to un-retire and join up.
I don‚Äôt trade Mobley.  I think he can become LaMarcus Aldridge on floor level with potential to have an even higher ceiling.
Legendary Chicago Bull LaMarcus Aldridge
"I remember 2006 was regarded as a weak class very early. It turned out a number of guys who had respectable careers, though: Kyle Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rajon Rondo, J.J. Redick, and Paul Millsap come to mind. Not a standout class, but it turned out a bit better than people thought, and definitely better than 2000."
"Lamarcus Aldridge lasted decently long with a heart condition, not saying it‚Äôs the same but I‚Äôm optimistic"
Evan Mobley‚Äôs floor in his prime is considered by many as LaMarcus Aldridge.  That‚Äôs the status of that player.  I just can‚Äôt imagine someone at 6 who we would like more.
"They still had LaMarcus Aldridge, an ALL NBA Power Forward."
DeRozan was supposed to lead you to playoff wins in the Western conference surrounded by what? LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay's aging asses? FOH
2015 - 3rd in effective field goal percentage  2016 - 10th  2017 - 26th  2018 - 6th  2019 - 14th  Almost like Pop recognizes his team is better when they shoot a limited number of 3 pointers because his main scorers were DeMar Derozan and a 33-35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge
"&gt;In the NBA, he lost the crazy Spurs playoff streak and now they haven‚Äôt been in the playoffs for two years.  Dude is clearly a scrub. I mean a real coach would definitely be in the playoffs in the western conference with *checks notes* DeMar Derozan and a 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge..."
"Same reason people don't consider curry a true point guard. People are dumb. The whole ""true"" position is dumb.  If those people had their way every power forward has to play like LaMarcus Aldridge and every point guard has to play like John stockton."
"Chris Bosh, people think he was this great PF when in reality he wasnt even better than guys like Lamarcus Aldridge."
"Lamarcus Aldridge retired.  The Knicks didn't suck.  Ainge left the Celtics, coach Brad Stevens didn't leave but is not coach anymore. Rick Carlisle is on the Pacers bench.  Ben Simmons is not good anymore.  DWade owns the Utah Jazz.  Myles Leonard made a huge mistake and is now a free agent."
"I feel like people look at the 2014 Rockets-Blazers series and assume Damian Lillard was the best player on the team for those games, but LaMarcus Aldridge was unstoppable at times against a still elite Dwight Howard. I think he deserves the recognition of getting the team to the conference semis."
Blazers got Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge
I'll start:  LaMarcus Aldridge ----&gt; Dirk Nowitzki----&gt; Kevin Durant
"Unlike nephew here, LaMarcus Aldridge probably witnessed the greatness and tragedy that was the 2002 NBA Playoffs. So the title should in fact read ‚Äú u/Rahul____Raja never saw the Sacramento Kings in the Playoffs ‚Äú."
bit hard to sign big names when you're already paying three hall of famers  and the one year we had cap space we signed LaMarcus Aldridge soooooo
lol the one year we had cap space we signed LaMarcus Aldridge (the biggest free agent that offseason).  i don't know why some Spurs fans always push this narrative that nobody wants to come here just because we're a 'small market'  we were paying three hall of famers over the past two decades. bit hard to sign big names when you don't have the cap space.
He should work with Lamarcus Aldridge could you imagine if Giannis could do the little shoulder shoulder shoot thing
LaMarcus Aldridge
"Drummond vs Bucks in 2019, game 1. (this performance actually holds the record for worst plus/minus in the playoffs ever).  LaMarcus Aldridge vs Houston in 2017. game 1.  Draymond vs OKC in 2016, game 3.  &amp;#x200B;  Simmons was choking on offense for sure, but he still was +29 for the series. People expect more of him and rightly so, but this collapse was on the whole team. And Doc, I mean who tf puts Simmons and Thybulle on the court together."
"‚ÄúTwenty three years after medically retiring due to a heart condition, LaMarcus Aldridge sets to join the Nets for the 2021-2022 season.‚Äù"
"&gt;So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east?  lol @ losers and up comers as **accurate** for classifying Derozan, Butler, Giannis, Melo, PG, and Lowry. And no, I did not compare them to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk, because there is no need to do so.   I compared them only to, themselves, and the celebrated status they enjoy.   Therefore I stick my argument, that those players are comparably effective as the West stars. Plus I chose to use that year's ASG roster, because it gave the best **real time** window into who all was playing at an elite level that season when the East was so ""weak"" as some people imagined."
"So a bunch of prime of their career hall of famers in the west and a bunch of up and comers and perrenial losers in the east? Just read your own list, your comparing Derozan, Butler, young Giannis, Wall, Melo, recovering PG , Lowry, Kemba, and Milsap ..... to Durant, Curry, Harden, AD , Kawhi, Westbrook, Prime Boogie, left out players like Dame, CP3, Blake Griffin, Tim Duncan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Dwight Howard, Dirk.

"Irving will decide in middle of the season to go do his weird social justice projects, and you will be wishing for a Ben Simmons instead of seeing Lamarcus Aldridge or whoever else the Nets signed from the 2013 All Star roster‚Ä¶"
"Literally nothing like Lamarcus Aldridge. You can‚Äôt make a comeback from never having been anywhere in the first place. He had a streaky 3pt shot, and horrible ‚ÄòCuse defense. He was big and had a lot of potential, but his work ethic was almost non-existent and he lacked drive. I was a big proponent of his for a while. Would have loved to see him get burn over Assey Lyles or whatever minutes Richard Jefferson or Darrell Arthur were taking, but Malone gonna Malone, and Lydon wasn‚Äôt up for pushing through the G.I. Coach tough love of bench grinding."
He can still make a comeback. Sort of like lamarcus Aldridge
He's the reason no one really appreciated Chris Bosh. Give that man a decent team and he could be the best player on an ECF team. He was like LaMarcus Aldridge but better on defense.
"Nope. I disagree.  Giannis accomplished the highest value items you can. LaMarcus Aldridge has more all stars than him, Joe Johnson too. They aren't even CLOSE to his level."
"Here were the players drafted ahead of JJ in the 2006 NBA Draft:  1-Andrea Bargnani  **2- Lamarcus Aldridge**  3-Adam Morrison  4-Tyrus Thomas  5-Shelden Williams  *6-Brandon Roy*  7-Randy Foye  **8-Rudy Gay**  9-Patrick O'Bryant  10-Mouhamed Sene  &amp;#x200B;  The players that ended up being better than JJ (imo) are bolded.  Although I hesitate to put Rudy Gay ahead of him because of the playoff appearance discrepancy.  Brandon Roy is italicized cause he had a higher ceiling than JJ, but it was never actualized due to injury.  For a few years (2007-2011), JJ Redick was considered a bust, and people were quick to label him that given his reputation at Duke.  But he turned it around mostly with a super great work ethic, falling into the ""white guy tries hard"" athlete stereotype.  His consistency and impact on a game are uniquely spectacular.  I don't think that being on 13 straight playoff teams was a coincidence; those teams were good because his off-ball movement added a dimension to the team's offensive game.  After a weird start to his career, which included an injury, DWI and abortion contract, his fortune seemed to turn around in 2009 during the Magic's surprisingly deep playoff run.  He played a good series against the Celtics and his future head coach Doc Rivers, who would appoint him the starting 2-guard of the Clippers in the following years, was the opposing coach in that series.  The mid 2010's Clippers are historically overrated in the sense that they should have won a title.  That is mostly because they never made a conference final.  I am a Warrior fan and I feel strong about this.  Their roster was sick though, and it was fun to watch them.  The last point I want to make about JJ is that he was kind of a cultural icon for white basketball players around 2003-2006.  Many (white) players sported buzzcuts on the AAU circuit those summers, wore ankle socks and worked on their jumper."
"Greg and brandon‚Äôs careers were robbed by injuries. Assuming the blazers still get the same picks they wouldve had this lineup in 2015:  Prime Brandon Roy, prime Greg Oden, young Damian Lillard, peak Nic Batum, prime Lamarcus Aldridge, young Wes Matthews, young c.j. Mccollum.   We were absolutely robbed of an actually comptetitve Warriors-Blazers rivalry."
"lamarcus aldridge 50+ game, was riveting multiple overtime game and the spurs shot like 70+% from three"

"Nets players can't practice at the facility if they are not vaccinated, so my guess are players who haven't been at the facility recently. Lamarcus Aldridge, with his heart condition and Paul Millsap, whose been practicing elsewhere."
"I don't think he wants much ($).    It's just a combination of things that make him unappealing.  Obviously his health.  Also his public dispute with the Pelicans.  Also his podcast.  If you are a GM do you want to deal with someone that took a dispute public and has such a venue to air grievances?    Also lets be real, part of this was to draw people to his podcast.  If he wants to 'unretire' like LaMarcus Aldridge, he can, if he doesn't it bought his show a bit of exposure on major networks.  ."
"How far would a team of ""Way Past His Prime"" and ""Scrappy Veterans"" get?  **Scrappy Veterans:**  * Paul Millsap * Wesley Matthews * Dwight Howard * Trevor Ariza * George Hill * Garrett Temple * Taj Gibson * Goran Dragic * Rudy Gay  **Way Past His Prime:**  * LaMarcus Aldridge * JJ Redick  * Jeff Green * Andre Iguodala * Carmelo Anthony * Rajon Rando * Udonis Haslem*"
"Yeah I agree.  Bucks had to go thru Miami who looked nowhere near as good as the year prior. Brooklyn, whom, if we are being honest, was more of a real Finals match-up than anything. Atlanta, who overachieved but got decimated in a couple of those games and the Phoenix, the pseudo Cindarella story, who just got outclassed by Giannis all series.  Meanwhile, Dirk had to go through Portland, sporting Andre Miller, Wesley Matthew's, Gerald Wallace, LaMarcus Aldridge, Marcus Camby, Brandon Roy, Nicholas Batum and Rudy Fernandez. That team, defensively, was pretty darn good. This was back when in order to make playoffs out west you had to have more than 45 wins, upwards to 50 to have a shot at a good seed. Next round they outed the Bryant, Gasol, Fisher, Bynum (when he was good), Odom Lakers squad. Finally they had to get through the Thunder, who were young as hell. That team was basically Durant and Westbrook with a supporting cast. Sefolosha, Perkins and Ibaka started and the bench was mostly just Harden and Collison with a little Eric Maynor in there. And of course finally they beat the Heatles.  Not quite sure on comparisons here but the Suns and Hawks of this year were probably just as hard as Portland or OKC was for the Mavs. Lakers and Heat were far greater than anything the Bucks beat. Nets are damn damn good but those 2 squads were just loaded with hofers."
"Also, we never trade Tyrus Thomas for Lamarcus Aldridge."
"Let's get a whole class going.  Players:  Chris Smith.  Literally only was in the NBA because of his brother, JR Smith.   Ricky Davis for shooting at his own basket to get a rebound for a triple double.  Ben Simmons is one of the better players to get into this hall but yeah.  Coaches:  David Fizdale for obvious reason.  Luke Walton for even more obvious reasons.  Executives and FO:  Cavaliers in LeBron's first run.  They built no good supporting him around him for years and gets mad when he rightfully bailed.  Isiah Thomas.  A rarity to go in the HOF and this HOS.  Great player and did have a decent eye for talent but his roster management was absolutely horrible and destroyed the Knicks organization for about 10 years.  Like the pick used by Chicago to get LaMarcus Aldridge was initially the Knicks pick they traded to get Eddy Curry.  Then theres whole sequel assault/harassment stuff.  Teams:  The 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats.  In the lockout shortened year they had a record of 7-59 which is the record for the worth win% of all time."
"Fun fact: LaMarcus Aldridge, Boogie Cousins, Brandon Jennings &amp; Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal all had larger career highs that KD.  Fred Van Vleet also has the same career high as Durant."
"&gt;Neither team has taken the easy way out the way the Warriors did.   LMFAOOOO okay. Ig signing KD, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, and trading for James Harden ain't the easy way? I hate the Lakers more than I hate the Nets, but you're out of your mind if you have a problem with the Warriors signing KD on top of their homegrown core that they built through good drafting and development, but no problem with a bunch of superstars grouping up together in Brooklyn, literally involving the same guy you had a problem with in Golden State."
Myles Turner in his first summer league was hitting turn around mid range faders like LaMarcus Aldridge lol.  Didn't expect him to become what he has but he's very good.
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"MLB contracts can also hamstring teams, I agree (see Joe Mauer), but the difference is you can surround them with cheap players and still compete.  I also do agree, guaranteed contracts are terrible as they are structured now.  If a team spends the same amount of money (the salary cap/floor), the players on average will get the same amount of money, it will just go to those that still deserve it.  If contracts weren't guaranteed, I bet Blake Griffen, Paul Milsap, Rajon Rondo, LaMarcus Aldridge, etc would take some of that dead money, and rightfully so."
"Even with all those teams, 60% don't sniff the finals.  Do other sports not have stupid teams?  What about Blake Griffin, Paul Milsap, LaMarcus Aldridge?"
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.

Not quite the same thing - but I remember Bruce Bowen offered Lamarcus Aldridge to wear his (retired) number [12 when LMA joined the spurs](https://twitter.com/evansclinchy/status/619555173736648705) \- fun times lol
"the Nets have Claxton, Lamarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin and Paul Milsap, there was just no space for him there, at least with the Lakers he can share playing time with Dwight"
Nets  _______________  PG: James Harden  SG: Paul Pierce  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Blake Griffin  C: Lamarcus Aldridge  6th man: Jason Terry
"many would be .  I would not be personally bc there are examples of players today that have improved their 3 point % drastically . From below average to above average. And they have less work ethic as MJ.  So for those reasons , I just couldn‚Äôt be surprised.   i.e., Al Horford &amp; LaMarcus Aldridge.  We are also discussing once in generation type player. If Zion Williamson were to become an elite 3 point shooter , I would be more than surprised. I‚Äôd be shocked."
Lamarcus AldridgeüôÑ
Lamarcus Aldridge. Seemed so close we signed old ass Tyson Chandler
OOTL: is LaMarcus Aldridge not retiring?
It was public knowledge at the time that he wanted Lamarcus Aldridge. They were both from Texas.
"Agreed. Even in my theoretical, utopian HOF, he makes it. I just wish the bar was closer to Paul Pierce than it is to Lamarcus Aldridge or Blake Griffin lol"
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D‚Äôandre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day‚Äôron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Yup, 2 top 10 players, then you add a recent mvp who just average another triple-double over the season, and now the way they've added to their bench, the way I heard so many people just a few months ago whining and bitching about the Nets adding LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin, yeah this is definitely a super team for sure"
LaMarcus Aldridge is underrated &amp; deserves to be in the hall of fame.
"Signed Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, James Johnson, got off Deandre Jordan‚Äôs contract and got a high potential player for him. Drafted Cam Thomas (summer league MVP) and Dayron Sharpe"
"If that‚Äôs enough for an HoF resume, you‚Äôve got guys like Amare Stoudamire, LaMarcus Aldridge, John Wall all making it in too. I raked through for guys kinda matching or even surpassing the stuff listed.  All decent players but HoF? I dunno"
"I think this one will be overrated just because of the names you can bring up that he beat..   Beats LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy in the first round   Beats Defending champions Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol in the second round   Beats Durant Westbrook and JAMES HARDEN (who wasnt really james harden yet but that will get lost in time) in the WCF   Then does step up and beats Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the finals..     Thats 8 HOF Locks and two Solid names on portland."
"Plus on the other end he could guard KG, Duncan or any of the elite power guards of that era one on one no problem. He didn't get the 3 point shot until later in his career but his defense and that unlockable turn around shot was always there. Sheed was a better but more tumultous LaMarcus Aldridge, even if LMA has better numbers in the box scores."
You forgot Primo Pasta who went number one of Lamarcus Aldridge. Im not sure how he wasnt first on your list since hes the only one who went first in the draft.
"Interesting omissions are Terry Stotts and LaMarcus Aldridge. I wonder if they were not invited, or if they declined to attend. I know Stotts just got fired, but he was Lillards only coach for his entire career until this year."
"Lamarcus Aldridge, Marbury, David West, Tyson Chandler, Joe Johnson, Matrix"
&gt;For instance in the Spurs case it's probably LaMarcus Aldridge.  Portland would like a word....
Terry Porter   CJ McCollum   Brandon Roy   LaMarcus Aldridge   Rasheed Wallace
Current- Cj McCollum Past- Lamarcus Aldridge Injured/incomplete- Brandon Roy
LaMarcus Aldridge and John Wall will totally be forgotten in 2030s cz they didn't win a title and didn't stay fit/ long enough in their teams. Also they are in small markets (NBA). If the wizards and Blazers somehow become big markets in the future maybe. DeRozan but he's not as good. I can see Griffin starting to get forgotten way faster than people think.
"i could see them keeping him only if he was actually good/skilled so young guys can pick something up. like Vince Carter being on that hawks team, for example. and the veterans also need to want to be in that role to start with. I don't think DJ is that guy so he is useless to them pretty much. or Dirk staying a few more years with the team even though he was barely playing. And players like let's say LaMarcus Aldridge, i could see a rebuilding team keeping a player like him but he probably has no interest in playing for a lottery team, maybe in a year or two when he has little left in the tank, like going back to POR whatever the roster looks like..."
LaMarcus Aldridge  Joe Johnson  Paul Milsap  Danny Granger  Kemba Walker
I think Lamarcus Aldridge fix that problem
LaMarcus Aldridge
"He's as much a star at this point as Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap... Aja he used to be one but now isn't"
Either Blake or lamarcus Aldridge. Blake was pretty good against Giannis and Aldridge can be passable. The nets will also get the luxury of double teaming off Westbrook and rondo so it will literally be two players guarding him
Lamarcus Aldridge
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
Lamarcus Aldridge
Mj was very good at being low turnover. But there are a lot of score first mentality guys who have low turnovers because you usually get them from trying to pass. Dirk and lamarcus Aldridge are two examples. Kyrie is an example of someone who has had decent assist numbers with low turnovers
"Tyrus Thomas is up there. He got traded for Lamarcus Aldridge, which is a good indicator of his ability."
"Bron was able to team up with d. Wade and Bosh. He also got to recruit A. D.. Kevin Love is the only star talent outside of that and Love has always been injured or underperformed. Shaq must be mentioned too. But by the time Shaq reached Cleveland he was also on a downslope.  Kawhi played with a DYNASTY so he didn‚Äôt need to recruit. He then forced his way to play with Toronto, which was an amazing choice for him. He then recruited PG13, who is probably better than everyone not argued AD. D Wade was hobbled by the time the Heatles formed so I take PG.  Kobe was able to force pickups of Gasol, Dwight, SHAQ, Gary Payton, and Karl Malone.   KD was able to join maybe one of the best teams we‚Äôve ever seen. He then was able to recruit Kyrie, James Harden, Blake Griffin, and Lamarcus Aldridge.  Bron has done nothing unprecedented with his recruiting. No ‚Äúelite talent‚Äù wanted to go to Cleveland. If Bron played with the talent/fits that Kobe and KD have then he‚Äôd have more rings."
"Good is from which perspective you're looking from. It's good from a team perspective since teams get control back, but bad from players' perspective. Like you said, the players association wouldn't agree to this.  An alternative I was thinking about is putting the limit on buyout players you are able to sign to 1. The favorable destination teams would then have to be more careful in waiting for the buyout market to develop and players would have to negotiate buyouts earlier if they want to go to a favorable destination.  For example, Nets got Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge last year. They would've only been able to get 1 in my alternative."
"Sure but OP didn't really ask about highlight enjoyment. A person can absolutely adore Lamarcus Aldridge fadeaways but that doesn't make them ""incredible highlights"" lol"
"Kobe was from a different era.  You should be looking at midrange stalwarts from the 3-point era like Carmelo, DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge."
"Had the Nets won last year (if LaMarcus Aldridge hadn't medically retired, and Griffin continued his surprisingly solid playoff run), they'd probably be the polarizing poster case for the 'buyouts are bad for the league' crowd. Same goes for the Lakers with Drummond.   Overall though, you're right, and a lot of the controversy probably stems from just the average casual fans' general lack of understanding of NBA salaries, which is amplified by a few quotes from small-market GMs/execs that have spoken out against it. The benefit seems a lot greater when you're on the outside looking in, even if it isn't backed up historically with more wins."
"At varying points Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Anthony Davis were all better than Love and it wasn't close at the time, though people pretended it was."
"Everyone always says this but I think that's far from a guarantee. The West was really good at the time between OKC, San Antonio, and the Grit and Grind Grizzlies. Plus if they were still planning on going after Dwight Howard, I think that probably would have still blown up in their faces even with Chris Paul instead of Steve Nash.  Imo the real difference is that having Chris Paul would have set them up way better for the post-Kobe years, and they would have been in much better shape to withstand the Dwight fiasco. With Paul as a Laker, they could have really thrown themselves in the mix for LaMarcus Aldridge in 2015 or KD in 16. But then that leads to the question of do they still get LeBron and AD in this timeline. And do we still get the 2018 Rockets? Does the Warriors run look different with some real competition in LA? There's truly a lot you can unpack with this what-if"
LaMarcus Aldridge was much better basketball player than Rondo. For a man who spent most of his career in Western Conference 7 times all star and 5 times all NBA is great achievement.
"Between Grant Hill, Bosh, and Lamarcus Aldridge."
Eghh.  In that LaMarcus Aldridge Tier in the Hall of Very Good.
"Tbf, the optics of an NBA drafting kids out of college would look pretty bad if it were introduced today.    And I don't think they'd refuse to play. It's more buyouts would stop being so frequent because suddenly it's only worthwhile if you like the team who has the most money or if you're on a ""anywhere would be better"" type team.   LaMarcus Aldridge probably wouldn't have taken a buyout from San Antonio last season but Kevin Love probably still would get bought out by Cleveland this offseason."
Lamarcus Aldridge had heart surgery his rookie year
"Blake Griffin is the Brooklyn Nets' starting C and spent a some of the series against the Bucks' being the second best player on the team. Andre Drummond is 28 and signing with a new team. Kevin Love is still a player most teams would want on a minimum. LaMarcus Aldridge was good, and I don't think we can treat his retirement due to heart problems as typical.  Maybe bought out player used to be a waste, but that wasn't the case last season and it wouldn't be the case with Kevin Love especially since some of his poor play so clearly comes from the level of effort."
"We're forgetting Blake Griffin? LaMarcus Aldridge wasn't exactly nothing, and only wasn't their starting C because of a heart problem."
"Yes but they didn't just draft Tyrus Thomas, they drafted LaMarcus Aldridge and decided to trade him for Tyrus Thomas. By that point they already had some solid young talent in Kirk Heinrich, Ben Gordon, and Luol Deng. Adding Aldridge, Noah, and Rose in the next 3 drafts would have resulted in a purely self drafted contender much like when OKC got Durant Russ Harden Ibaka in consecutive drafts."
"Honestly the only conversation is AI and Nash.   Anyone who played in Mikes era is done for.   Vince wasn‚Äôt good enough as a #1. He was just too chill   Lamarcus Aldridge doesn‚Äôt belong on this list.   Back to AI, Philly consistently got rid of anyone who was a scorer and instead added role players. They should have changed this and AI could be more inclusive, not need to take 30 shots a game   With Nash you can make an argument he should have never left Dirk and Finley."
"&gt;Why yes I can. I spent 10 years thinking about exactly that. Think Chris Paul and Joe Johnson and Josh Smith would have been any good?  IIRC, Joe Johnson didn‚Äôt play for the Hawks until 2005-06? I‚Äôm not sure if that trade for Diaw happens, but there was probably limited sign and trade offers available.  The Hawks probably suffer for another 1-2 years and respectively are able to move up in at least the 2006 NBA Draft.  They probably end up with CP3, Smith and LaMarcus Aldridge."
He had All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge his rookie and sophomore seasons. Since: zero All-Star teammates. Terrible take
Lamarcus Aldridge.
"&gt;You‚Äôre expecting a franchise player with that pick  Should you though? Historically thats not really true  KD, Jkidd, Gary Payton, Isiah Thomas are like the only 3 I see on the list since 1980. Theres other good players like Lamarcus Aldridge, Alonzo Mourning, Mike Bibby but franchise level? Oh Stevie Franchise I guess too lol"
"who thought this guy would contribute anything, ever?  dudes always been a liability, like that dude from detroit who got bounced to china.  these guys are like late 80s players being phased out from the game.  signed off size alone.  so many of these fakers out there.  playes like DJ remind me of a johnny football, can play a good nfl game once ever 20, but played good enough in college to fool everyone.   with football there is less longevity but no one can convince me this guy was anything but a money leech, never truly helping a championship team or anything.  hate players like this.  lamarcus aldridge, that fat ex raiders qb.  so many"
I think if LaMarcus Aldridge won a ring he woulda been a lock.
"Dame Lillard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Marc Gasol, Dirk Nowitzski, Brandon Roy"
"If you look at the 2016-17 Spurs team, they had a largely unproductive Lamarcus Aldridge, Danny Green, and close to retirement Tony Parker/Manu/Pau Gasol. That team won 61 games and was a Zaza Pachulia undercut away from a competitive western conference finals appearance. I don't particularly like Kawhi and his malevolent robot ways, but at his best he really is at the same level as those guys you mentioned"
Trail Blazers just because I don't want to repeat teams that others have said  Damian Lillard  Bill Walton  Clyde Drexler  Scottie Pippen  LaMarcus Aldridge  Definitely could give a lot of teams a run for their money
LaMarcus Aldridge   Tracy McGrady  Vince Carter  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Paul Millsap  Rudy Gay  Marc Gasol  Kemba Walker  DeMar DeRozan  Shawn Marion  Dwyayayayane Wade
"Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Marc Gasol, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and LaMarcus Aldridge (maybe) will be split among 2 teams."
"Might be a hot take but if a guy doesnt even have 4 All NBA selections, they shouldn't be in the hall of fame. I'm looking at you Reggie Miller.  LaMarcus Aldridge has a better resume than Reggie."
"The reason I did this all this was because a lot of people were supporting Chris Bosh for HOF.  Bosh is a 10x All-Star but ONLY 1 All-NBA team selection.  IMO, Chris Bosh is a good but not great player.  I think LaMarcus Alridge &amp; Chris Bosh have had similar careers &amp; numbers but Bosh played in a weaker conference thus had more All-Star appearances &amp; played on more contenders thus more rings for Bosh than Aldridge.  If Aldridge played for the Heat instead of Bosh, I think the results would be similar."
"The Aldridge part is on Marks IMO, because like this is 2021, you DONT need to have Lamarcus, Millsap, Blake, Claxton, James Johnson on the same roster, especially because one of your best role players (Bruce Brown) is defacto a big on offense"
"Knicks traded a first and a swap for Eddy Curry who was overweight and iirc had a heart murmur or something.  And had only had like one good season and was a shit defender.  The picks they gave up ended up being Lamarcus Aldridge and Joakim Noah.  They did manage to make a decent pick with the #23 that they received in the swap though, with Wilson Chandler.  David Griffin ain't got nothing on Isiah"
"Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, and Lamarcus Aldridge would mean a Blazers threepeat as champions within 5 years of Oden getting drafted."
The Bulls were right to pick Tyrus Thomas over LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Lamarcus aldridge tried to knee currys knee, undercut kd when he shot a three, and hooked draymonds legs with his own when dray was tryna run off"
LaMarcus Aldridge is who comes to my mind.
Lamarcus Aldridge is pretty lethal with his midrange. Got to include him.

"he fouled both harden and lamarcus aldridge on the same play against the nets  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qdvgwe/highlight_harden_finds_aldridge_for_the_dunk_the/  slaps harden on the face then just wildly swings his arms and clobbers LMA  that was a bad foul to take too, arguably cost them the game.   refs really dont like calling fouls at the end of close games like that but cmon man thats just reckless and sloppy"
There is a post on the front page about Lamarcus Aldridge saying everyone says that the mid range is a bad shot. Despite 'everyone' not actually saying that. Seems like hyperbole to me but it is massievly upvoted. I wonder what the difference is.
PLAYER	TEAM	AGE  Andre Iguodala	GSW	37  Carmelo Anthony	LAL	37  Chris Paul	PHX	36  LaMarcus Aldridge	BKN	36  LeBron James	LAL	36  P.J. Tucker	MIA	36  Paul Millsap	BKN	36  Al Horford	BOS	35
"With everything else going on this season, I totally forgot that Lamarcus Aldridge is playing again. Fuck yeah good for him"
"He‚Äôs still LaMarcus Aldridge, 36 or not. Put some respek"
Is there anything better than a lamarcus Aldridge midrange
How do you let LaMarcus Aldridge outscore your whole team 9-1 in the last 5 minutes of a game?
Is there anything better than a lamarcus Aldridge midrange
When the 76ers somehow blow this game because 40 year old Lamarcus Aldridge shoots 80% from the field
LaMarcus Aldridge has redeemed himself
It's cool to see LaMarcus Aldridge back.
"I understand, but there have been guys who weren't great at backing down who still had a great post fadeaway. KG and Lamarcus Aldridge immediately come to mind.  Kristaps doesn't get his shot off well even against smaller defenders, which is the real problem."
"It's very weird that the tipping point for you boils largely down to team success, especially when Parker got to play with Duncan and Manu, while Dame got CJ McCollum and 3 seasons of LaMarcus Aldridge."
"2001: Pau Gasol (3rd)  2002: Yao Ming (1st)  2003: LeBron James (1st), Carmelo Anthony (3rd)  2004: Dwight Howard (1st)  2005: Deron Williams (3rd)  2006: LaMarcus Aldridge (2nd)  2007: Kevin Durant (2nd)  2008: Derrick Rose (1st)  2009: Blake Griffin (1st), James Harden (3rd)  2010: John Wall (1st)  2011: Kyrie Irving (1st)  2012: Anthony Davis (1st), Bradley Beal (3rd)  2013: nil  2014: Joel Embiid (3rd)  2015: Karl-Anthony Towns (1st)  2016: Ben Simmons (1st), Brandon Ingram (2nd), Jaylen Brown (3rd)  2017: Jayson Tatum (3rd)  2018: Luka Doncic (3rd)  2019: Ja Morant (2nd)  You could argue that some of these players aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù but everyone I‚Äôve listed is all-star calibre. Now you might be correct in that the top 3 in a draft does usually have a bust, but your claim that top picks don‚Äôt result in superstars is flat out wrong."
wait I thought lamarcus Aldridge left the league because of a heart problem last year???
"i think lamarcus aldridge is still a viable option. maybe not as good as he normally is, but i can see him being the starter  edit: i saw you meant to trade, claxton is great for the future, i think trading for a griffin replacement would be smart instead of a center"
Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge only players on Brooklyn on the top of the plus/minus scale lol. Go spurs go?
"I don't think comparing Michael Jordan with ANYONE, much less Lamarcus Aldridge is going to bode well, even if your point is correct"
I‚Äôm so happy to see LaMarcus Aldridge on the court again üôåüèæ
When did Lamarcus Aldridge come back
"casually bringing Patty Mills, Paul Millsap and Lamarcus Aldridge off the bench is kinda wild"
LaMarcus Aldridge said the exact same thing literally months before going to San Antonio.
"1. Anthony Davis, $32,742,000 2. Steven Adams, $29,592,695 3. Nikola Jokic, $29,542,010         3. Joel Embiid, $29,542,010         5. Kristaps Porzingis, $29,467,800         5. Karl-Anthony Towns, $29,467,800  7. Andre Drummond, $28,751,774 8. Al Horford, $27,500,000 9. Nikola Vucevic, $26,000,000 10. Rudy Gobert, $25,775,281 11. LaMarcus Aldridge, $24,000,000           Look me in the eye and tell me that maxing a center doesn't come without risk."
"Nobody was clamoring to go because they were shit, didn't Barkley want to go to Phoenix? Lamarcus Aldridge came to San Antonio and the spurs are in a way smaller market."
LaMarcus Aldridge always seems to get 50 points against us every time.
"This is why Davis to me has non-top 5 prospects going forward.  He was showing promise as a stretch big early in his career but has plateaued.  His biggest offensive strength is scoring in the paint.  Potentially due to durability concerns, the past few seasons he's upped his volume from the midrange and especially in the playoffs.  During the finals run, he shot what appears to be an unsustainable % by his career numbers.  If he continues this style of play he'll become a better defensive Lamarcus Aldridge?  Can the Lakers transition to another title core around that?"
"For real. We have:   Kevin Durant, James harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap. That‚Äôs insane already"
"I‚Äôm pretty sure OKC has the most  Wiggins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Barton, Lou Will, Patty Mills, Fournier, JJ Barea  Also the entire Magic team for some reason"
"Kevin love was all nba and Kyrie was an all star the season before Lebron came back to the cavs. Without Kyrie, Who‚Äôs the third best player on the Nets that was all nba/all star? Blake Griffin? Lamarcus Aldridge? Patty mills? Joe Harris? Lol  Duos are not superteams. KD/Harden and good role players is an even playing field with Kawhi/PG or Lebron/AD without Westbrook."
How did you include lamarcus aldridge as a potential top 100 guy?
"LaMarcus was traded last year‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt on the team and then retired after a few games with Brooklyn. How is he relevant to the Spurs missing the playoffs?  You are moving the goal posts here: Goes from Pop missed playoffs as soon as Duncan retired‚Ä¶ to yeah they made the playoffs but should have done better, to Lamarcus Aldridge and Demar didn‚Äôt play well and that‚Äôs Pop‚Äôs fault.  In summary you have no idea what you are talking about"
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
Woah therez sakuragi developed a jumpshot late in the anime. He had that lamarcus aldridge range
Patty Mills??? Lamarcus Aldridge??? LMFAOOOO Bucks in 6
"Big cost of depth??? Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, Paul Millsap--I think they recovered that depth just fine"
"Name one? LeBron came to LA after they had drafted the baby Lakers. Carmelo, Lamarcus Aldridge, and KD all passed on LA and some didn‚Äôt even bother meeting with the Lakers."
He averaged 18 points per game and was listed at 6‚Äô9‚Äù and 235 while playing. The Portland Trail Blazers have not had a decent power forward since Lamarcus Aldridge and currently are playing Covington at the 4 who is listed at 6‚Äô7‚Äù and 207 pounds. He would do well on the Trail Blazers and would also fit well in today‚Äôs NBA
I don't think LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin sell as many tickets as they used to
"They have James Harden, Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Blake Griffin. Kyrie isn't going to make them lose much from ticket sales"
Lamarcus Aldridge is anime style risking his life every time he touches a basketball for this team. meanwhile he can‚Äôt get a shot that‚Äôll protect him and his fellow players :/
"Lebron James,¬† Chris Paul,Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Dwayne Wade, Deron Williams, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Lamarcus Aldridge, Amare Stoudemire, Dirk Nowitzki,John Wall, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph, Chris Bosh ,Paul Pierce,Steve Nash  There are 23 players here.  Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."
Blazers big 3 of Brandon Roy Lamarcus Aldridge and oden went 50-12. Yes I am crying
Probably not. Does LaMarcus Aldridge make it to the HOF?
"I only have data from the 2004-05 season onwards, but here are all the lineups with at least 100 games:  * ('Ben Wallace', 'Chauncey Billups', 'Rasheed Wallace', 'Richard Hamilton', 'Tayshaun Prince') 227 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Garnett', 'Paul Pierce', 'Rajon Rondo', 'Ray Allen') 221 * ('Kendrick Perkins', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 209 * ('Al Horford', 'Joe Johnson', 'Josh Smith', 'Marvin Williams', 'Mike Bibby') 180 * ('David West', 'George Hill', 'Lance Stephenson', 'Paul George', 'Roy Hibbert') 171 * ('Andrew Bynum', 'Derek Fisher', 'Kobe Bryant', 'Metta World Peace', 'Pau Gasol') 144 * ('Andrew Bogut', 'Draymond Green', 'Harrison Barnes', 'Klay Thompson', 'Stephen Curry') 136 * ('Jeff Green', 'Kevin Durant', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Thabo Sefolosha') 133 * ('Bradley Beal', 'John Wall', 'Marcin Gortat', 'Markieff Morris', 'Otto Porter Jr.') 128 * ('Danny Green', 'Kawhi Leonard', 'Tiago Splitter', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 124 * ('Damian Lillard', 'LaMarcus Aldridge', 'Nicolas Batum', 'Robin Lopez', 'Wesley Matthews') 114 * ('Bruce Bowen', 'Manu Ginobili', 'Rasho Nesterovic', 'Tim Duncan', 'Tony Parker') 110 * ('Andre Roberson', 'Kevin Durant', 'Russell Westbrook', 'Serge Ibaka', 'Steven Adams') 109 * ('Jason Collins', 'Jason Kidd', 'Nenad Krstic', 'Richard Jefferson', 'Vince Carter') 106 * ('Derrick Favors', 'Donovan Mitchell', 'Joe Ingles', 'Ricky Rubio', 'Rudy Gobert') 106 * ('Andrei Kirilenko', 'Carlos Boozer', 'Deron Williams', 'Mehmet Okur', 'Ronnie Brewer') 101"
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
"Honestly, I think Drummond was one of the least appreciated big men in the 10s. Dude was just stuck in some mediocre teams but my ex-BF's father's cousin told me he was a legit skilled offensive player who can bully guys smaller than him, while beating guys bigger than him off the dribble, look at his IG videos in training camp at age 45, he had mad handles for a guy his size. Plus dude can rebound like Rodman in his prime, his offensive rebounding numbers were GOAT tier. It's too bad he just never got the chance to shine, whether it was never getting the right teammates or the right system to thrive in. People talk about guys like LaMarcus Aldridge or Zach Randolph or DeMarcus Cousins as underappreciated but conveniently forget about Drummond. Probably because he never got along with more well-loved teammates like Griffin, LeBron or Embiid.  There's a reason the Pistons call his time in Detroit as the Drummond era."
&gt;DeMar DeRozan? Gone. LaMarcus Aldridge? Gone. Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are gone   but Joshua Primo has arrived
Yeah especially when your current young star is asking for LaMarcus Aldridge and you pick Bargs instead anyway.
"&gt;Brooklyn Nets: Got LaMarcus Aldridge back  Dunno, extending Kevin Durant was also kinda big"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
 Lamarcus Aldridge is more than 3 years older than Andrew Bynum.
i forgot that lamarcus aldridge is back.
"None of the star players for either team are playing. I think the biggest name seeing minutes today is LaMarcus Aldridge. I'm not seeing anyone saying the Lakers are EXPOSED and of course it would be ridiculous to say that.  Edit: my bad, AD is out there today. EXPOSURE"
"&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a fairly quiet group. Most of the guys are to themselves; they stay in their own little shells. It‚Äôll be nice to get them out, open up a little bit, even myself. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that loud, but ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more loud than anybody on this team, like Paul [Millsap], LaMarcus [Aldridge], Patty [Mills], [Kevin Durant], you‚Äôve got a lot of guys who are just to themselves. So it‚Äôs my job to open them up a little bit‚Äù.   Exactly how I imaged the Nets"
Yeah a team with two top 5 players in the league including the 4 time mvp and best player AND and 11 time all star isn‚Äôt better than a team with Westbrook and Ibaka as the second and third best player.  You must be drunk dude.   And just fuck no. The 2015 Spurs with an injured Kawhi and Lamarcus Aldridge was not as good as the 2013 Spurs with Duncan. That might be one of the more stupid things I have ever heard.
"AD vs LaMarcus Aldridge, battle of dominant western conference bigs"
Jevon Carter-Bruce Brown-Sekou-LaMarcus Aldridge-Nicolas Claxton starting lineup lets go
LaMarcus Aldridge and Cam Thomas are combining for 70 against Malik Monk and THT
"If ""good health"" includes mental health/emotional stability then I agree.  By the way, apart from the obvious, a good health guarantee on Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap would be a big deal."
"Chicago Jimmy went NUCLEAR on us everytime, certain players always seem to hit a different gear vs particular teams (LaMarcus Aldridge also comes to mind)"
"Following Dame since even before he got drafted and seeing the type of person he is, his personality, and believing his actions and words.  Plus seeing the other side of the coin in players like Lamarcus Aldridge say they want to stay and be the best blazer of all time and then leave the next summer. I know what just saying the right thing looks like, and Dame is different. He‚Äôs 100% a loyal guy it‚Äôs easy to see"
"I mean who of significance has signed in NY, LA, or Miami in the last decade though? Lebron, kawhi, KD/Kyrie, and butler? If you‚Äôre counting Dwight Howard, harden, Paul George, etc getting traded to those cities as those markets getting all the players, then there‚Äôs plenty of great players that got traded to markets other than those. PG resigned with the small market thunder before wanting out. Chris Paul got traded to the rockets thunder and Suns and resigned there. Jimmy butler got traded to the timberwolves and left because they wouldn‚Äôt pay him. Then he got traded to the sixers and left because they wouldn‚Äôt pay him. The Spurs signed lamarcus Aldridge in FA, who chose them specifically over the lakers.   People whining about how their specific team hasn‚Äôt gotten a top 10-20 player in FA need to understand that there‚Äôs not a lot of those players and they aren‚Äôt often free agents. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to get top level players, and whining about big markets while simultaneously being a top 5 market is genuinely hilarious."
"    pg: Kyle Lowry -&gt; Rajon Rondo (2006)     sg: Duncan Robinson -&gt; Shai-Gilgeous Alexander (DR undrafted, using draft of rookie year 2018)     sf: Jimmy Butler -&gt; Kawhi Leonard (2011)     pf: PJ Tucker -&gt; LaMarcus Aldridge (2006)     c:  Bam Adebayo -&gt; Zach Collins (2017)  Feel like the only straight downgrade is Bam to Zach Collins. Spacing looks pretty rough, though."
"Caris LeVert and LaMarcus Aldridge have underlying health issues. They could die. There are some other players in the same boat too. Probably some of the league coaches and trainers, refs, statisticians, security, etc. might also have health issues. They could die too.   One of my fully vaccinated friends died from it not long ago. He had a health condition that made him more susceptible to getting more severe symptoms. Does it have to be in the thousands of people dying to just do the right thing?"
"LaMarcus Aldridge, Larry Nance SR, Amar‚Äôe, Tom Chambers, Walter Davis"
"he's missed half the season and even then I can think of half a dozen plays that one might categorize as unnecessarily reckless  like slamming josh giddey into the stanchion so hard its surprising he didn't break his back or fouling harden with a slap to the face and then immediately clobbering lamarcus aldridge half a second later.   and he's always had a habit of falling down maybe-semi-accidentally onto people and rolling their ankles  I can't really talk though mitch robinson on my team is kind of the same way, he's really throwing his weight around this year and if he's slow to rotate you might get clobbered"
"Wild how a roster of KD, James Harden, Joe Harris, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills being the 1 seed by one game over the Wizards is considered impressive this year lol"
Westbrook  Also I don‚Äôt know what the general consensus is among Blazer fans on LaMarcus Aldridge but I‚Äôve come round to liking him again
He's been 7ft tall and playing like a guard since highschool - - that's going to take a toll on your body over the years so he's a little more beat up than most. He needs to figure out how to slow his game down just like Russ and LBJ do. Play more like a Rudy Gay or LaMarcus Aldridge. Less dribble moves and more purposeful shots. The role he is in right now is perfect. Catch and shoot or catch the lob. Lessen his iso load so he can have more energy to do more team oriented things.
"id say yes tbh. the nuggets roster is really depleted. so is the nets right now, but harden in his diminished state is still a decent player. then lamarcus aldridge and patty mills have been really good. harris has played most of the year and has been pretty good. right now we're banged up but we had a good 15 games of health."
lamarcus aldridge on booker is not it
"I feel like they any of the duo fit better than this trios, like we spent all summer talking about the Russ/Bron fit, but when they are only thos 2 it works, but this trio can't work if AD isn't better as a shooter and as a defender. Like we all know the weaknesses in Russ' game, but AD floats to the perimeter like he's Lamarcus Aldridge despite the fact that he's (sight can't believe I'm gonna say that) an even worse shooter than Russ"
"U keep moving the goal post Lol. That Blazers team had a young Damian Lillard, who was an allstar that year and a prime LaMarcus Aldridge who was averaging 30 points and 2.5 blocks a game that series, and they had a good starting five overall"
hes washed and he just got shown up by Lamarcus Aldridge tonight .
"But because we‚Äôre the lakers we went from having Adam Levine beg for Lamarcus Aldridge to signing LeBron James a few years later lol  I hate the ‚Äúlakers exceptionalism‚Äù argument but it‚Äôs absolutely true in this case. We were a dumpster fire when LeBron came and he literally came because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the lakers, oh and Hollywood is right there so I can focus on my post basketball career.‚Äù It will happen again, or we will draft some good talent, or we will become a decent 5 seed team, who knows. That‚Äôs half the fun"
Griffin is ass for the time being. This roster wasn't constructed for a 37 year old LaMarcus Aldridge and patty mills to score 15-20 points every game to win. As it is built now it also isn't optimized for harden or kd atleast not without kyrie. Just because we have players that can contribute doesn't mean there isn't flaws in a roster that was built under the assumption they'd have a 27ppg 50/40/90 scorer.
"Probably when we had the core of Roy, Oden, and Lamarcus Aldridge all in their early 20s only for it to completely blow up 2 seasons later"
I like the implication that this means at least one of DeMar DeRozan or LaMarcus Aldridge will be in the Hall of Fame.

Good thing the Zebras were there to save the day  And LaMarcus Aldridge  But mostly the Zebras
Davis thinks he's Lamarcus Aldridge without the ability to post-up.
"Glad to see LaMarcus Aldridge feasting after coming back from his heart condition. Sad that it was against our team. Happy that we made it close-ish out 4 starters! I actually think we might be able to stay around .500 until later December, when Mobley and maybe Sexton should be coming back."
Sloppy win. But I'll take it. Harden showing some life. And LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE! MVP of the game.  ^So ^uh ^what ^happpened ^to ^Cavs ^BigMen?
"As they play the warriors who‚Äôs second best player is Andrew Wiggins. Their rotation  is a team full of G leaguers   ‚ÄòNo help‚Äô is an unfortunate side effect of the anomaly that was Lebron in Cleveland (the first time around). That was a very unique situation.   Since then, and in today‚Äôs game, it‚Äôs damn near impossible to really have ‚Äòno help‚Äô. But Stephen A‚Äôs clown ass and others have helped create an environment where stars get passes and role players get blamed. Which is ass backwards.    This man has James gotdamn Harden. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters‚Ä¶EVER. Lamarcus Aldridge is contributing. Bruce brown is the same guy who was lauded as a glue guy just months ago . Like get this out of here   Not only that, they‚Äôre 10-5! Get Stephen A off the air man. He has too much power and he really effects the culture of how people talk basketball"
"Ah yes, the ""no help"" consisting of James Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Joe Harris, etc. Like if you can't at least go deep in the playoffs with that roster, you might not be as great as you think. Kyrie should be what separates them from ""Clear title favorites"" vs ""One of the most stacked teams of all time"". Anyone who even implies that KD doesn't have enough help is smoking huge amounts of crack."
"How can people even argue KD has no help?  The nets have MVP and 3 time scoring champ James Harden.  LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin?  I guess don't really know who is coming off the Net's \*bench\*, but its not like KD is leading a bunch of crappy starters."
"Lamarcus Aldridge is the most overlooked player in the NBA.   He‚Äôs one of the top players of his generation, everybody knows he‚Äôs one of the top players of his generation, but nobody EVER mentions him when talking about the top players of his generation."
"Don‚Äôt forget Blake griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge, the team is virtually the same as last year when everyone was calling them 2021 champ‚Äôs just off face value, now kyrie is afk and Durant has NO help?!?! Stephen A was one of the main people praising the team last year as well"
"Forgot about that. Their offense has looked extremely poor in comparison to last year. I‚Äôd typically chalk that up to no Kyrie, but last year without Durant, the Nets looked great on offense. So there‚Äôs something schematically wrong there. I do agree though, I just wanted to be careful and not just come to the conclusion myself that he‚Äôs a bad coach without actually having watched the Nets everyday. When I saw him bench Lamarcus Aldridge the entire first half then put him in the game when it was already basically over and use him the wrong way, I just don‚Äôt see how this guy has that job"
You just proved he's more efficient though. Not scorer.   That's like saying durant is a better scorer then Michael jordan.  the stat sheet just says such and such had 50 tonight not well this person had 50 on 68ts% be more if his usage rate went up 4% and his assist ratio was lower.   Side note  If Curry is so good advanced wise how come he isn't top 20 like kobe in Ewa. The stat that shows how much value of winning you bring on the court.  Dude is all the way at 58 next to LaMarcus Aldridge bruh...
"&gt; Says who?   Ummm‚Ä¶like I said, most people. That‚Äôs why guys like Bob McAdoo, Pete Maravich, Willis Reed, and Bill Walton made the list while guys like LaMarcus Aldridge, Mark Jackson, Joe Johnson, and Antawn Jamison didn‚Äôt even come close."
"Larmcus Aldridge, well know cousin of 7 time all-star LaMarcus Aldridge."
Where was LaMarcus Aldridge?
LaMarcus Aldridge just not getting play time.. coooooool
"I think you‚Äôre putting waaaayyyy too much stock into career totals. Most people don‚Äôt look at things like that when considering who the best players of all-time are.   If they did, Vince Carter would‚Äôve easily made the list since he‚Äôs in the top-20 in points. Guys like Antawn Jamison, LaMarcus Aldridge, Tom Chambers, Mitch Richmond, and Joe Johnson would‚Äôve gotten serious consideration as well, since they‚Äôre in the top-50.  If you, personally, think of compiling stats over a lengthy career as the main hallmark of greatness, then that‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm just explaining that most people look more at things like championships, individual accolades (such as All-NBA teams), and peak performance when assessing greatness, and in those areas, AD is more than qualified."
"People talk about a ""downsizing"" in the league, but that has primarily occurred at the 4, not the 5. Most traditional power forwards have now either shifted to center if they are big enough (plus some guys just get older and slower and sort of ""age into"" the position), and/or expand out to the three-point line. Kevin Love and Paul Millsap starting shooting threes. Lamarcus Aldridge and Al Horford are centers now. AD slides between the 4 and 5. Ibaka went from regular PF to stretch center. A lot of 4's now are just big wings. Mmmm, big wings."
"That the Blazers went 50-12 when Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, and Lamarcus Aldridge all played. there was a post that debunked it, it was actually more like 50-24, give or take a game  [credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/eydm5k/oc_the_blazers_did_not_go_5012_with_odenlmaroy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)"

I agree but let‚Äôs talk about that later. Right now we‚Äôre watching Lamarcus Aldridge.
"Unlike virtually anyone mentioned as a replacement for Dame on the list, Dame has played on a small-market team his entire career and without any fellow stars.  Dwight has played alongside Lebron, Kobe, James Harden, Vince Carter, etc.  Kyrie's teammates and teams have a similar profile.  Paul George has played with Kawhi, Westbrook, and Dame's career stats are simply better.  Dame's best teammates ever were Lamarcus Aldridge for 3 seasons and CJ.  To do what he's been able to do in Portland without other weapons to spread the defense is absolutely insane."
"Cmon now, what they‚Äôre doing now clearly isn‚Äôt working. He shouldn‚Äôt be outsourced by LaMarcus Aldridge"
"Tough one for sure, I can emphasize. LaMarcus Aldridge looks fantastic though, I think he‚Äôll be a huge help for you guys later in the year. Automatic on catch &amp; shoots"
"In a battle between ex-Spurs DeMar DeRozan triumphs over Patty Mills and LaMarcus Aldridge, 118-95."
KD and LaMarcus Aldridge get to ride the bus back to the Nets hotel. Everyone else has to walk.
"[Quite a few](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=who+are+the+active+players+with+at+least+14%2C500+points+all-time), dwight, Lou will, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy gay, steph curry, demar derozan, and Dame"
TIL Lamarcus Aldridge only has 2043 assists in his entire 16 year 1038 games career.
Lamarcus Aldridge shooting like 87% from 16 feet
"Is it weird to say LaMarcus Aldridge? After he was forced to retire last year and looked like never playing again, the guy has been an absolute bucket this year. I've seen a few games and I swear he's shooting 100% on jump shots this year"
LaMarcus Aldridge
"No Kyrie, Harden playing like shit on both ends, Joe Harris still in that playoff shooting drought, having to rely on washed Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge to pick up the slack offensively to fill out numbers. Yeah.... KD irritates me but so far it's really hard to argue MVP right now. Especially when all other potential candidates are slacking behind like Luka, Trae, LeBron. Only one close to him is Steph who is playing the best defense of his career early on so far.  Edit: Forgot Jimmy Butler. He's deserving of some consideration."
"Wilt only won when he dialed back his scoring major and became a good playmaker. what does that tell you about his legendary scoring prowess?  And no. It‚Äôs not nonsense‚Ä¶  we‚Äôre not comparing him to LaMarcus Aldridge here‚Ä¶it‚Äôs Shaq.  In the playoffs, Shaq scored on higher volume and more efficiently"
"Good point there, KD and Harden were both on yhe Thunder in thier one finals appearance and even though theyve left should still be an important part of the fams memories. Also guys who were big names like Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge are draws as well."
"I really don‚Äôt agree and don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre downplaying a lot of what was said in the article. If even half of these are true and verifiable then Sarver can be kicked out due to sexual harassment (and pulling an employee‚Äôs pants down and humiliating them in front of 60+ people definitely classified as that) as well as the racist comment about the black players needing a black coach (and using the n word while doing so). There‚Äôs absolutely enough there to open a solid case against him.    Sarver once used the N-word when trying to explain to a staffer why he preferred hiring Lindsey Hunter over Dan Majerle as head coach in 2013, according to a high-level executive who heard the remark  **These [N-words] need a [N-word],"" Sarver told the staffer of his largely Black team, according to the executive.**  A young Black coach could better relate to Black players, Sarver reasoned, and could ""speak their language.""  I don't like diversity,"" Sarver replied, according to Watson and a basketball operations staffer with knowledge of the interaction.  [Sarver to Watson] ""You're f---ing toxic!""  Former employees said he asked players about their sex lives and the sexual prowess of their significant others.  In March 2011, Sarver berated that same female former employee over a tribute video to honor then-Suns executive Rick Welts, according to two employees with knowledge of the interaction. Sarver's issue was that he wasn't featured more prominently in the video and that, instead, it featured more of former Suns owner Jerry Colangelo, who hired Welts. At one point, the woman broke down in tears, to which Sarver said, ""Why do all you women around here cry so much?""  **Several employees recalled separate instances in which Sarver referred to staffers and players as ""inventory.""**  When the Suns were recruiting free agent LaMarcus Aldridge in the summer of 2015, the team knew that Aldridge had young children in Texas and that playing near them was appealing. During the recruitment, Sarver remarked to two basketball operations staffers that the Suns needed to have local strippers impregnated by NBA players so those players would have children in the Phoenix area and feel obliged to be closer to them, giving the Suns a potential edge in free agency, the now-former staffers said.  Former Suns account executive David Bodzin said that in August 2014, **Sarver pantsed him in front of more than 60 employees at the team's ALS Ice Bucket Challenge**. A former senior basketball staffer and a former senior marketing employee confirmed this account to ESPN. In the aftermath, Bodzin said, an HR representative smirked and said, ""Please don't sue us for sexual harassment.""  In another instance that season, Sarver went into the training room to talk X's and O's with rookie guard Elie Okobo. Veteran guard Jamal Crawford left the room.  ""He actually got up off the table and walked out of the room and said, 'I can't f---ing listen to this s---. I gotta get out of here,'"" a second former staffer said. The former longtime staffer in the room confirmed the scene to ESPN. Crawford declined to comment.  In 2017 two former employees said that a white male executive repeatedly called a Black co-worker ""Carlton,"" in reference to the character from the '90s TV show ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" In at least one instance, he jokingly told the co-worker to ""do the Carlton"" for him. The employees said the Black co-worker on multiple occasions told the white executive to stop calling him by that name and that he was not going to dance for him. ""Super racist,"" one former employee said.  One female former employee said that after being physically assaulted by a male co-worker outside of the office, a female co-worker went to HR out of concern for the employee's safety. The two told ESPN that HR spoke with the alleged victim, ultimately deciding that simply moving her desk would resolve the issue. At that time, the alleged victim said there were two rows of desks -- with partitions separating each one -- and that hers was right next to the male co-worker's. They moved her to the second row. ""I couldn't escape,"" she said, adding that if she stood up, he was right there, probably less than 10 feet away. ""It was a joke. An absolute joke.""  One female former sales employee said a former Suns vice president, who appeared intoxicated, asked her how many members of her department she had slept with and about a specific coworker's penis.  When aggrieved workers said they had been considering legal action after being told that the organization would be parting ways with them, two former business operations employees said those people were often offered severance packages in exchange for signing nondisclosure agreements.  Within the first decade of Sarver's tenure, a few members of the approximately 20-person ownership group explored having Sarver removed, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry. The operating agreement that sealed Sarver's position as the team's ""governor"" was quietly reviewed by outside legal counsel. But outside counsel soon relayed that Sarver's contract effectively prevented him from being removed absent serious criminal behavior or similarly egregious conduct."
"Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Bembry, Patty Mills. The Nets front office is world class."

"I think there's something to just giving all-NBA to the 15 best players. No disrespect intended, but Tyson Chandler shouldn't have made all-NBA while someone like LaMarcus Aldridge was on the outside looking in. And it doesn't make sense that we had seasons where Kawhi, KD, and LeBron couldn't all make the first team."
Lamarcus Aldridge Curry
LaMarcus Aldridge is unreal to start this season holy shit
"You get a top 10 all time player in their prime every decade lmfao. Lakers have at most mediocre management, but they still get the largest free agents showing up at their doorstep because of the market and city. If the Lakers were still in Minnesota then they‚Äôd basically be what they were during the washed Kobe and pre Lebron eras: A trash bottom feeder team that squanders all of its picks and perpetually misses the playoffs. They would legit be the current Sacramento Kings. Bulls and Spurs actually earned their rings seeing as how both teams actually drafted and developed their superstars. The spurs‚Äô biggest free agent signing is literally LaMarcus Aldridge while the Lakers have had Wilt, Kareem, Shaq, and Lebron joining them just for the lols. Hell, Kobe literally forced his way to the Lakers by telling other teams that he wouldn‚Äôt play if they drafted him."
https://youtu.be/9ZI1pPqoGNc  Here‚Äôs Steve Nash and the locker room referring to LaMarcus Aldridge as ‚ÄúLA‚Äù. You must have started watching basketball yesterday.
The LaMarcus Aldridge Clippers
LaMarcus Aldridge
"bias, but lamarcus aldridge has been our 2nd best player this season."
"This is speaking with hindsight, cause I doubt the spurs expected age and injuries to hit Lamarcus Aldridge as hard as it did in the last few years of his spurs career, but it would‚Äôve been nice to trade him or move on from him before that happened"
If Bosh had *a little* more pull in the front office you guys would have had LaMarcus Aldridge.   That would have been *nice*.
"Ah yes ""for 20,000 career points, 7 all star appearances, and probably getting a ring later this year we induct LaMarcus Aldridge into the NBA hall of fame!"""
Well we probably wouldn't have come back to tie it if he had been ejected. He went on a nice run of turnovers and missed shots and playing poorly. We needed James Harden and LaMarcus Aldridge to get ejected if we wanted to win.     Or we could just not be shit for 1 game.
"And Pau Gasol, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Bosh, Amari Stoudamire, Zach Randolph, Rasheed Wallace... still a ton I'm leaving out but the PF position of the 2000s is one of the great eras of any position ever."
My list would be  1) jokic 2)embiid 3)KAT 4)sabonis 5)vucevic 6)Lebron 7)ad 8)Lamarcus Aldridge  9)porzingis 10)Zion
Lamarcus Aldridge. He established himself in Portland at the same time Curry changed the game. Big men shooting mid range is not a commodity anymore and the game passed him by
With a higher risk of re-tearing it I imagine? I remember Lamarcus Aldridge did the same thing and ended up needing to have surgery later on.
LaMarcus Aldridge is the (basically only) success story.
Demar Derozan and being the glaring problem for the Spurs  Lamarcus Aldridge and not being the glaring problem for the Spurs

"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."
" Spurs, almost 8  DeMar DeRozan 21.3  DeJounte Murray 15.0  Keldon Johnson 16.2  Lonnie Walker 12.7  LaMarcus Aldridge 12.0  Rudy Gay 12.2  Party Mills 12.3  Derrick White 9.0 almost"
"And Derrick Rose... and Isaiah Thomas... and Jae Crowder... what an absolute disaster of a team. Ty Lue had horrible rotations that year... Crowder at the 4 was absolutely horrible.  The de facto lineup was Crowder at the 4 and Love at the 5... Jae at 6'6"" would just get punished by bigger players like LaMarcus Aldridge. Love/Thompson was much better."
"Nope. We played the lakers well in the second game against them and could've won the game against the pelicans but our center rotation is garbage with LaMarcus out. No clue when he's coming back. And our defense hasn't improved much despite getting rid of Bryn and Belinelli. I expect it will get better as the season goes on but we won't be a good defensive team with Aldridge-Poeltl-Eubanks being our centers. Barring Dejounte starting to play far better on offense, I don't see us managing a record around 0.500 without White."
"yeah, you'd have to be insane.  Warriors are stacked at the 4 already.  We obviously needs wings not Lamarcus fucking Aldridge"
Hey be more creative  We can also trade for Blake Griffin or Westbrook or Lamarcus Aldridge or Al Horford
"but there's still a lot of dudes, who like lma, don't shoot 3's and still put up a lot of points - if lamarcus aldridge could get within 3 of doing this, giannis could do it."
well you just said lamarcus aldridge did it two seasons ago  so yeah probably
"I've always referred to LaMarcus Aldridge as LMA, and always get weirded out when the Spurs local announcers just call him LA."
or LA for lamarcus aldridge. i used to think ppl were talking about los angeles lol
"West is a blood bath and the Spurs still have LaMarcus Aldridge who is a defensive black hole and has actively hurt their team the last 2 years. Outside of like 2-3 teams, I'd say it's not a given any West team makes the playoffs."
Another season in Austin and an expiring contract in Rudy Gay and Lamarcus Aldridge
"Even the TNT crew is not going to talk about rings when analyzing LaMarcus fucking Aldridge, lmao. The smooth-brained nephews in this sub hear the word ""rings"" when the discussion involves players like Shaq/Chuck, LeBron/Jordan, Wilt/Russell and they think it applies to every player ever. Rings get brought up then because those discussions literally involve comparing some of the best players to ever play their positions. Nobody fucking cares if LaMarcus Aldridge benchwarmed his way to a free ring, lmao. Nobody's even going to remember him being on that team.  If the rings argument worked the way people here think it does, Patrick McCaw would be one of the best active players."
"Yeah the Nets definitely need more name recognition. I can't think of anyone on their roster who is a big draw like LaMarcus Aldridge. Or where you suggesting the Nets front office didn't research how the players they signed are playing this year? Also a reasonable take, they obviously hadn't seen that fat guy who loves strip clubs play this year before they traded for him lol. I wonder how he's doing in BK..."
I didn‚Äôt whine once. I could care less about old man Blake griffin tough guy dunking on his former Pistons team and LaMarcus he‚Äôs still in the league? Aldridge.   The Nets are a clown team that won‚Äôt survive the eastern conference and barely hanging on to a top spot in the east cause everyone else in the conference is trash. Totally soft schedule. Receipt me.
"The difference in that argument for a player like Aldridge is not gonna be whether they trick or treated for a ring pop at the end of their career. People aren't gonna suddenly look back at Aldridge NBA resume and think ""wow he got a ring playing 4 minutes a game, what an absolute god. He's so much better than Jimmy Butler, who took a team of sophomores and Goran Dragic to the finals.""  The rings argument matters when it's a player like Shaq shit talking a player like Chuck. Or if it's LeBron trying to make his case against Jordan. LeBron makes a super team and the rings still become a part of his narrative because he's the one who's carrying those teams. Nobody's going to look at LaMarcus fucking Aldridge or DeAndre Jordan and suddenly change their opinions on them because they averaged 2 points while benchwarming for the most stacked team in the league."
"empty stats. andre drummond, blake griffin, and lamarcus aldridge are the 3 most overrated players in the nba at this point"
My man... it's 2021; Austin Rivers is better than Blake Griffin or LaMarcus Aldridge.
"I disagree. Dennis Schroder, Gasol and Montrezl are not better than Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan and Lamarcus Aldridge. But if you add Andre drummond to the list, instead of Gasol. Then they‚Äôre probably equal."
The Spurs biggest get was what? Lamarcus Aldridge? One time.   They wanted in Cleveland because Lebron played there. Lebron would've never wanted to be there it he wasn't from Ohio.
"No, I mean not blowing up all of your cap space on guys who aren't going to get you where you want to be.   10 years from now future fans who get into the game right now aren't going to care. This is the reality of how teams win Championships. The 2004 Pistons were very cool, but they were an outlier. Every team that has won the title has been stacked to one degree or another.   Btw, we're talking about Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in 2021. Everybody needs to calm down. They didn't just add Kawhi. These are useful bench pieces who might give them 10-15 minutes a night."
"Nets add Harden, random scrubs be like ""oh but there is only one ball they will get destroyed by the Lakers""  Nets add washed Blake Griffin and old and washed Lamarcus Aldridge ""Nets are THE superteam now how could league allow this üò¢ """
"Lamarcus Aldridge has basically averaged 20/8 over a 15 year career, I don't see how that's not HoF worthy"
Blake Griffin is literally a bench player and LaMarcus Aldridge has absolutely nothing to offer other than being a massive defensive liability and a guy who would steal touches from the superstars. Joe Harris is clearly the Nets 4th best player. It's a neat collection of names but the last two aren't needle movers in any way and that's why they were both available for literally nothing.
"&gt; Yet in the NBA, After adding 31 year old Blake Griffin, and 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge, the media and a certain segment of fans are yet again beating the hate drum where it concerns Durant  It's really just KD/Kyrie haters trying to cope with the fact the nets are most likely going to win the finals. They can see it coming, so now they're already trying to discredit it.. before it even happens.. sad really."
"James Harden has never won a chip, Kyrie won a chip with LeBron (One of the bests to play in the NBA and has made it to the finals 10 times), a washed up Blake Griffin who has never even been to the conference finals, and an old Lamarcus Aldridge.   They can't win alone so guess what they decided to do? Create a friggin Avenger team."
"Hes 31 years old and probably looking to get one more decent pay day, so he'd be looking to showcase himself rather than ride the bench .   Hes in a completely different place career wise than LaMarcus Aldridge"
"I don't think many people were complaining when it was him and Kyrie and a bunch of role players. Hell most of the contenders have two star level players. The difference between Murray and Jokic and Kyrie and Durant is the latter are much better. But there's still only two of them. Many people were happy to have the era of the dynamic duo instead of the superteam, and his move to Brooklyn was supposed to usher in that era.   Steph and Klay, Bron and Davis, KD and Kyrie, Kawhi and George, Ben and Joel, etc. But then the Nets traded for Harden, so we got another superteam. Most fans (especially hardcore ones that are the most vocal) don't like superteams especially when there's only one.   But at least they had holes. Holes that would be near impossible to fix due to their cap constraints, a necessary sacrifice from forming a superteam. But wait, no, now we got dudes being paid by small market teams to play in Brooklyn on vet minimums. Obviously some will say they are not at the levels they were before and that's true. But that would only matter if they were starters, they are overqualified for the roles they are in. You're gonna have Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge going up against second and third stringers absolutely feasting.   So yeah, now people have a much bigger problem than when he left a superteam to form a dynamic duo. He is smart enough to understand why also, so I don't believe he doesn't know why."
"Yes and most people were fine with him starting a team from scratch with Irving. No hit to his legacy. Wants to be his own man with another person that want's to be his own man. No issue.   ... then they got Harden. A second perennial top 3 player in the league for the last decade and we all went ... what the fuck? Seriously? Okay I guess ... new Heatles .. but they have the same problem as the Heatles, junk after the top 3 and/or no defense.   ... then they got Blake Griffin who immediately remembered he could dunk, Deandre Jordan, LaMarcus Aldridge ... they have something like 45 all-star appearances on that team now ... this is bullshit.   Thus, the comment ""this Nets all-star bullshit team"", meaning it is an abnormality and on a different scale. The Heat had a big 3, just like the Celtics, the Spurs, the Lakers before them. This Net's team is literally on par with the East all-star team."
What other team is starting LaMarcus Aldridge?
"35 year old Lamarcus Aldridge and knee surgery Blake Griffin really got you in your feels, huh"
"Not sure why the signings of Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are making everyone concerned about the Nets as a super-team lol.  The Nets were already a super-team without them, and they‚Äôre going to be role players with limited minutes.  Everyone‚Äôs been saying that Blake and Aldridge are washed the season!!  No reason to hold a grudge because they decided to join a team that has a chance at the championship."
imagine freaking out that lamarcus aldridge is joining nets. this aint 2010...
"i realize that.  i'm saying everybody freaking out because they added a guy who is averaging 13/5 and playing atrocious defense isn't really justified.  there are reasons to think the nets are OP, but adding lamarcus aldridge, who will just take minutes from equal/better players like green and claxton, isn't one of them."
the POINT is that some people are overblowing the skill level of lamarcus aldridge and treating this like a 5 man super-team formation. See the main post for context.
"Didn't even know he was an FA, but thinking about it now if he's trying to go to a finals contending team I wish he went to the Lakers just because I think the color commentary for a team with Marc Gasol and LaMarcus Aldridge would probably sound kinda funny."
"Lol.  As if broken down Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are making the Nets a super team.  That teams biggest problem is its shitty defense, and neither of those guys were great defenders in their primes.  They're both okay shooting bigs who don't add a lot else."
"LaMarcus Aldridge isn‚Äôt that good anymore. Would everyone be freaking out if the nets got Daniel Theis? Fuck no. But he‚Äôs a better player than Blake, DJ and LA. These are just names. They aren‚Äôt anywhere close to what they once were"
"Aldridge and Griffin are complete trash this season. As a bonus go and watch the 7 time all star Lamarcus Aldridge Shaqtin appearance this season, it was hilarious."
"I just find it funny that the reaction to them getting Harden was 50/50. With an equal amount of people saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only 1 ball‚Äù, ‚ÄúKD, Kyrie, and Harden won‚Äôt be able to coexist‚Äù and ‚ÄúThey have no defense + depth‚Äù as there were people thinking they were the new title favorite.  But adding 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge and past his prime Blake Griffin somehow makes them unbeatable."
"its hilarious that everyone keeps using blake griffin and lamarcus aldridge as super team defining pieces. theyre both like rashard lewis and shane battier joining the heat. Dont get me wrong, Irving, Harden and Durant are a super team but their next best player was Deandre Jordan."
"League needs to step in and stop this. NBA is being RUINED by the day with all these players just making Massive superteams. Kyrie, KD, Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, LaMarcus Aldridge. This isnt ok"
Dude they got LaMarcus Aldridge you act like he‚Äôs prime KG lmao
If LaMarcus Aldridge signed with Boston the narrative would‚Äôve been that he‚Äôs washed   Lakers and Lebron fans have brainwashed so many people it‚Äôs insane.
"Well, it does help that LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake, while big names, aren't the players they used to be, there's a reason those got picked up in the buyout market.  KD formed his own squad, it's not his fault everybody wants to play with him for a shot at a title, what was he supposed to do? Say no? If Aldridge and Blake wanted to join the Lakers you could bet your ass that LeBron would welcome them with open arms and this sub wouldn't say shit."
"The Nets are a superteam, but it‚Äôs not because of LaMarcus Aldridge lmao. It‚Äôs 2021, not 2018."
"Imagine telling someone 5 years ago that the Nets could field a starting 5 of:  James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge"
You are going to lie before the lord and say LaMarcus Aldridge is currently better than Andre Drummond? LMA got benched for Jakob Poetl bro
"But also imagine telling them that in 5 years Blake Griffin will be basically a 6th man who was so overpaid he couldn‚Äôt get traded and  who can barely move, Kevin Durant plays 20 games over the course of 2 years because of injuries and Lamarcus Aldridge still won‚Äôt shoot 3s."
"They act like the championship is a foregone conclusion because they signed the ghosts of Blake Griffin and Lamarcus Aldridge lol. It‚Äôs like a weird form of posturing where if the Nets win the title they‚Äôll act like it was inevitable and therefore not impressive, but then if the nets lose (to a really good sixers team or whatever really good west team makes it to the finals) they‚Äôll act like it‚Äôs a monumental collapse."
‚ÄúUhhh but they have no bigs‚Äù  *Signs Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge*
Lol a healthy Lakers are still the favorites. This isn't even close to the 2017 Warriors. Y'all acting like Lamarcus Aldridge is prime Draymond Green
"In the past 3 seasons the nba franchises in Los Angeles and New York have gotten Lebron, AD, Kawhi, Paul George, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge. And likely Andre Drummond. This isn't healthy for the league."
Sorry which of those players are you taking out for 2021 Blake Griffin ~~or 2021 LaMarcus Aldridge~~ ?
"What superstar free agents signed with the Nets? 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge? Blake Griffin with no knees? Brooklyn was such a joke two-three years ago that even Knicks fans were like ""lol nobody cares about the nets"". Name one superstar free agent besides Kyrie Irving that signed with either Brooklyn or New Jersey.  I'll wait."
AD on da way again!!! Now we have enough to vanquish the blake griffin/ lamarcus aldridge nets!
wow first they get 7 time all star LaMarcus Aldridge who definitely isn't washed and then they get EVERY player in the league? smh
LaMarcus Aldridge also is a 50 points player.
You're still here? Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play for the Brooklyn Nets. That is all I'm going to respond to you from here on out. Continue to bash your head against Brooklyn brownstone if you'd like.
How does a washed LaMarcus Aldridge move the needle?
"If they get Drummond then their bench rotation will be some shit like Andre Drummond, Lamarcus Aldridge, Deandre Jordan, Claxton and Blake Griffin. They would destroy most bench units even if they're washed up lmao."
Making an argument that AD is a top 4 player in the league is a lot more credible than making an argument that Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge shift the title favorite odds lol
And I still don't care. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and James Harden and Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are playing for the team based in my hometown.
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
Its also the LaMarcus Aldridge-Royal Ivey reunion the world has surely been waiting for
It‚Äôs just such a dumb narrative. You think Steph worked harder than KD because he never switched teams? Your writing this because the Nets signed 49 year old Lamarcus Aldridge? Were you around when the Lakers signed Gary Payton and Karl Malone?
It's the LaMarcus Aldridge-Ime Udoka reunion the world has been hoping for
"Yea, sure, I‚Äôm the casual for thinking that prime kyrie and harden, along with joe Harris, Blake griffin, and lamarcus Aldridge have a 0% chance of winning a title. Yup, very dumb of me to think that the team running through the league right now has any chance win the title.   You‚Äôre a fool, harden and kyrie make the nets simply unstoppable on the offensive end. They can beat any team on any given night because of that. I‚Äôm not even saying they‚Äôre favorites, but the way they‚Äôre playing right now shows they would have a good shot without KD."
"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, like is this a different LaMarcus Aldridge?"
Everyone thinks Lamarcus Aldridge is an instant championship...?
A 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge is the tipping point?  Fans of teams in the east are so salty. They thought they had a shot with LeBron gone and here comes KD.
Wow people are really overreacting to past prime lamarcus Aldridge joining the nets. Yea he‚Äôs good at offense but damn he still can‚Äôt defend and teams will be hunting him all day when they are on offense. Same with Blake  Tbh if the lakers are healthy I still think they are better than the nets
I‚Äôm glad there is one fan base who isn‚Äôt crying their eyes out over the signing of 35 year old lamarcus Aldridge. Seriously wtf. If I was Lakers bucks clips suns Utah sixers fan I would still think my team had a shot
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge want to play ball with Brooklyn on their chest. I'm so proud of my hometown, and the work that Sean Marks has done."
No. Why is everyone bitching about 66 year old LaMarcus Aldridge signing with the Nets? He‚Äôs not that good anymore and what he does provide is redundant on that team.
I love how a washed up lamarcus Aldridge is the final straw to make this team unbeatable
"And Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake griffin were even worse than Ray Allen was in 2013 lol. And Bosh was not terrible lol, Lebron stans always shitting on lebrons teammates."
A team that has been trash for almost its entire existence finally gets a single season with a shot at a title and everyone loses their minds  How do we deserve any more hate than the Lakers who have talent just fall into their lap almost every single year just because of their location?   And the tipping point is fucking 35 year old lamarcus aldridge lmao
Why would they care?  The ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù talk only matters to dudes chasing a top 10 all time spot  You think Lamarcus Aldridge is gonna sit down with his grandkids and be like here‚Äôs my ring but the media was very mean to me about it so I regret everything...
LaMarcus Aldridge OOOO?
Wait it was 47 year old Lamarcus Aldridge that did it to you?
The Lamarcus Aldridge stopper
Lamarcus Aldridge has been terrible for several years.
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
bro it‚Äôs lamarcus aldridge in 2021
Because typically as you get further down a team‚Äôs depth chart there are less and less players who have been all stars in the last 3 years  This is not the case with Brooklyn lol  They‚Äôre so clearly already above the rest of the East without KD even playing and they‚Äôve got Lamarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin chillin on the bench playing spot minutes  Come on bruh
It's really not worth getting this upset over 35 year old LaMarcus Aldridge my dude lmao.
"Imagine if 5 years ago someone told you Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge would team up to play on the freakin Nets"
When was the last time they got a buyout as good as Lamarcus Aldridge or Blake Griffin? What did they even get last year? Markieff Morris? lmao
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
This sub went from saying Cousins to the Warriors was op to saying Lamarcus Aldridge to the Nets is op.  Jesus.
I have some ‚ÄúLamarcus Aldridge is washed‚Äù takes I need to delete
Ayyye LMAO. LaMarcus Aldridge  Ontheway
LaMarcus Aldridge. Bring him back.....
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
Got given a old Lamarcus Aldridge Blazers jersey and that was the year Dame was drafted.  Been a fan ever since
"A few of CloraPando's last posts  ""Perk floats the possiblity of the Steph Curry to the Lakers""  ""Frank Vogel says Lakers are ‚Äòexcited‚Äô for Anthony Davis to return""  ""Report: Analyst suggests Lakers are best fit for LaMarcus Aldridge"""
"honestly shocked LaMarcus and David Robinson are only one apart, with 4 and 5 respectively. Robinson led the league in scoring and was a way better rebounder than Aldridge over the course of his career. really surprised by that. lol"
"Jimmy Butler, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Joakim Noah."
Defensively adept backup center?????? Get LaMarcus Aldridge.
"Do you think Ben Wallace, Chris Webber, and Lamarcus Aldridge are first ballot?"
I always said: if prime lamarcus Aldridge is the third best player on a team then that team is going to win multiple championships.    That‚Äôs how I see it
"Those were really top heavy classes that didn‚Äôt pan out with most of the talent coming from late 1st and 2nd round picks.  ‚Äò04: Dwight Howard, Iguodala, Deng, Al Jefferson were the three stand outs (all 15th or higher)  ‚Äò05: Bogut (#1), Chris Paul (#4), and Gortat (#57) were the ones in this draft.  ‚Äò06: LaMarcus Aldridge (#2), Rudy Gay (#8), Reddick (#11), Rondo (#21), Lowery (#24), and Millsap (#47) slightly deeper but just as many bangers #20 on as there are in the top 20.  ‚Äò07: Durant (#2 ‚Äî sorry Portland), Al Horford (#3), Mike Conley (#4), Noah (#9), Thad Young (#12), Glen Davis (#35), and of course Marc Gasol (#48).  Edit: autocorrect"
"Especially because fg% doesn‚Äôt accurately capture how many shots are deterred before even being taken.   Gobert warps defensive game plans to where people don‚Äôt even take some of the shots they would normally take. On a similar, though less extreme level, Jokic gets to spots he knows guys want to shoot from to defer them from taking their preferred shots. That doesn‚Äôt show up on the fg% chart, but it does force the offense into taking a lower percentage look than they want to take. The series against the Spurs and Lamarcus Aldridge was the best example of that imo. LMA has those spots on the baseline and the elbow that he really loves, and Jokic was able to kind of force him off those spots or take them in a less comfortable rhythm than usual. Stuff like that doesn‚Äôt always show up in the stat sheet.  It‚Äôs why I said in an earlier comment that defense is by far the hardest thing for fans to evaluate. Not only are there countless assignments for each player on every play, but there‚Äôs also no great way to boil defense down to meaningful statistical numbers. The best we have are probably on/off splits. This leads to stuff like ankle breakers and poster dunks being seen as the ultimate in defensive breakdowns."
"it's not that I think he's more skilled offensively at all. I just think the defensive value is worth that much for centers. going from LaMarcus Aldridge to jakob Poetl made our team so much better, for example. I feel pretty strongly about the center position for defense."
Vucevic is LaMarcus Aldridge-ing us. üòî
"Plus DA can actually play in games, so he has that going for him.  I‚Äôm still high on KAT‚Äôs potential, but maybe he and DA are closer than I originally posited.  I think DA caps out as like a bigger Lamarcus Aldridge."
When you say Lamarcus Aldridge you're also saying Marc Gasol
LaMarcus Aldridge is the only old school pwerfoward i can think of and he plays center lol
LaMarcus Aldridge rolling in his grave
What if they can add a LaMarcus Aldridge or PJ Tucker?
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"blake griffin, kevin love, lamarcus aldridge, and Z-Bo were in the same tier  i think griffin and love were actually clearly better than Bosh personally"
"Yes, I am too? Why would you think I wasn't?  Did you miss when the basketball player Kevin Durant, the basketball player Kyrie Irving and the basketball player James Harden, as well as the basketball players LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin all chose to sign with the basketball team in Brooklyn, a Burrough if New York City, the Brooklyn Nets?"
LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin were both bought out this season because their contracts were untradeable.
"I'll always dispute this when people say the Lakers were trying to be bad. At the end of each season when it was clear they weren't gonna make the playoffs, sure, *then* they were no longer trying to win games and were instead prioritizing looking at their young players. But the Lakers were bad because of a combination of sheer incompetence by Jim Buss (and maybe Mitch Kupchak, depending on how much input he had), and having an aging star in Kobe Bryant.   Post Achilles Kobe wasn't any good anymore, and kept getting hurt, but the Lakers were trying to be loyal to him so he was still one of the highest paid stars in the league, and he wasn't wanting to take a back seat, so no other stars wanted to go sign up to be his sidekick. On top of that, the Lakers had gone all in on the Dwight Howard. Steve Nash combo, and that backfired and really screwed the Lakers immediate future, when Nash had essentially a career-ending injury in his 2nd game with the Lakers and Dwight Howard left after one year.  So that was the backdrop for why the Lakers were doomed to be no more than simply mediocre. But what made them as bad as they were was this stupid insistence that every year they could land a star player just cause they were the Lakers. So every year they tried to pitch the stars to join them, and when they got turned down (LeBron, Melo, LaMarcus Aldridge, etc), they would refuse to sign any non-stars to long term contracts so they could keep their cap clear for the next summer. Rinse and repeat.   This finally came to a head when Kevin Durant wouldn't even give them a meeting in 2016 (when he met with like 5 other teams), and the Lakers panicked and blew all their cap space on Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, signing both to fully guaranteed 4 year contracts for huge money. Mitch and Jim were both fired a few months later, and Rob Pelinka then spent the next two years trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole they were in."
"He actually seemed on track for all Star contention at the start of the 19-20 season, but then he broke his hand running into a LaMarcus Aldridge pick."
LaMarcus Aldridge
"Even in his 2 years in Boston, he wasn't selfish on the court. Sure you can say he was selfish with his career decisions wanting to leave Cleveland &amp; move to Boston to be a top guy but his actual game on the court wasn't really selfish. He was the best player on the court with the best PER &amp; even then he wasnt shooting some astronomical number (~18 shots a game both seasons. LaMarcus Aldridge shot that many per game in 2018 for reference. 18 shots for a ball dominant player is in line with what you'd expect if that) nor having any wild usage rates either. He very much played within the offense with Boston. So idk if it's my attention span in question or..."
"Fair points about the first ballot question. I think it may depend on who else is eligible when the 2025 ballot comes up. Are there 3 or 4 other bigger name talents who are still waiting to get in. I think the biggest names other than Vince that retired last year are Boggut and Barbossa. This year it was Joakim Noah and LaMarcus Aldridge. I feel Vince has a much better chance than most of them of getting in. Wade, Dirk and Parker all retired the year before. But I feel like they will all be first ballot HOFers. So he will be up against some people from previous years like Meta World Peace, Tayshaun Prince, Stephon Marbury, Manu Gin√≥bili. I feel like most of those players will either be elected in before they reach Vince‚Äôs year or they are less talented than him and won‚Äôt get into the hall in front of him."
"Ever since LeBron left, Brian Windhorst doesn‚Äôt have sources in Miami and most of the things he says is wrong about us. Most recently ‚ÄúLaMarcus Aldridge is a lock to go to Miami‚Äù as he goes to NY.   [Here is a reputable Heat source](https://twitter.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1393246375039676421?s=21)"
"**In order:** Jamal Crawford, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Bron, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Steph Curry, Paul George, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Giannis, Nikola Jokic, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown üçÄ, Jayson Tatum üçÄ, Luka Doncic, Zion, Lamelo.   **Honorable mentions:** '01 Tony Parker, '04 Andre Iguodala, '06 LaMarcus Aldridge, '08 Russell Westbrook, '11 Kyrie Irving.  It's funny my honorable mentions stopped at 2011 and didn't continue. Those are all the guys i almost picked over ny final pick for that year.  Tony Parker was a fantastic cerebral PG who won several championships with San Antonio. I went with Paul Gasol because he was one of the best 4s in the game and played at a star level alongside Kobe Bryant. That says alot.   Andre Iguodala was always a really good 2-way player and enjoyed a long, healthy career. But people forget how incredible Dwight Howard was. 4x DPOY, explosive athlete who managed to lead his mediocre Magic team past Lebron's slightly worse Cavs team.  It's a shame that both of my picks for '06 were guys that would end up having health problems. Although Aldridge had a much longer career, he was in the league for many years with a heart condition. Long story short, he is lucky to be with us today.  Derrick Rose was *not* by my knowledge ever an injury concern. But what I do know is that his intangibles blow Westbrook's away, and assuming both could've stayed healthy, I'd trust a Rose-led team over a Westbrook-led one any day (except maybe prime OKC...)  Klay Thompson is extremely underrated because he shares the court with the best shooter we've ever seen, but Klay is a fantastic 2-way player who can not only heat up with some of the greatest scorers ever, he also frequently gets the assignment of guarding the opponent's best perimeter or wing player because he can clamp them down. Also team chemistry."
"It is possible, but even this year it took insanely bad injury luck, and the Nets were still an inch away from winning it on KD's buzzer beater  * Kyrie - out with injury * Harden - out with injury, and then hobbled * Not to mention there was also Lamarcus Aldridge, who had to sadly retire due to a heart condition  That's 2 superstars and an impact player - it's an insane amount of production out with injury"
Really? Tweener positions are historically weak. LaMarcus Aldridge might be top 10 without thinking too hard
Paul George joined La but didn‚Äôt want join the lakers just like Kawhi. Paul George never wanted join the lakers I don‚Äôt know why your saying that. If La is such a great market why did no one join in 2013-2019 when the lakers had their worst streak. People like Lamarcus Aldridge didn‚Äôt want to join. Lebron was our first big name in like 7 years since Dwight. Your just wrong people rather join another contender besides La just because they don‚Äôt want LeBron to win. People don‚Äôt take pay cuts to come here the only person u can say is Trez which is a valuable argument.
Celtics may I interest you in our finest LaMarcus Aldridge?
" &gt;Do I think the Lakers would be better giving lamarcus Aldridge touches in comparison to giving them to Wesley matthews, markieff Morris, Marc gasol etc.? Yes, without a doubt yes.   Then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the Lakers issues.  Wes and Morris aren't really taking possessions away from shot creators, they are the benefactors of shot creators who are out their to stretch the floor and shoot threes mostly. You can't replace them with LA.  Gasol gas a super limited role in out offense but he spaces the floor and is a good passer which can help LeBron operate off ball.  Signing Aldridge does nothing for the Lakers."
"Yes he‚Äôs a negative on defense, but on a team like the Lakers who are a top 10 defensive team and when he would be covered by LeBron James and Anthony Davis instead of Lonnie Walker and DeMar DeRozan I highly doubt his defense would negate his offensive value at all.    Do I think the Lakers would be better giving lamarcus Aldridge touches in comparison to giving them to Wesley matthews, markieff Morris, Marc gasol etc.? Yes, without a doubt yes.   You can argue he‚Äôs a worse fit for y‚Äôall if you‚Äôre only valuing defense, but he‚Äôs without a doubt a better player than gasol"
"So you're agreeing with me then, you know that, right? The Lakers players are constantly extolling the culture and ownership of the team. LeBron is way closer with Jeanie than he ever was with Gilbert or Mickey Arison.   The Lakers didn't have competent ownership for a long time. That, combined with Kobe's injury, they had to tear it down. When Jimmy Buss ran the team they couldn't even get a second meeting with free agents like LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge said the Lakers' pitch was all about brand and history, and he didn't care about that because the team was bad. The Lakers failed to get a meeting with Kevin Durant and tons of free agents when they were bad.    A ton of you guys on this very forum were talking about how market didn't matter anymore and that the Lakers were foolish for trying to use their brand and history to land free agents.  You don't get to cry about ""Laker exceptionalism"" as being unfair now when for years a huge amount of users on here were parroting the line that ""players nowadays don't care about history or being a laker.""  The Warriors were not a free agent destination nor a big market team until Lacob and Meyers took over and the team became competent.   The Clippers have competent ownership. They didn't get any stars to stay when Sterling owned them.   The Nets have competent ownership. They were not on anyone's radar until they got it.   Miami has competent ownership.   Competent ownership and some type of plan to win matters way, way more than location alone."
LaMarcus Aldridge
"The hate against LaMarcus are mostly things that were outside of his control.   The hype surrounding his signing was huge...adding the top FA to the Big 3 shortly after two straight Finals appearances.   His one year with Timmy was great but got derailed by the KD/WB Thunder who almost toppled the 73-9 Warriors.  Then Timmy left. Then Zaza happened...follwed by the Kawhi fiasco, so he walked along with Danny Green. Then Manu and Tony...  Next thing you know, he went from being on a championship contender to a rebuilding team real quick.  We all knew life was gonna be hard after the Big 3, and Aldridge gave us some solid years...I wish him luck on his path going forward."
"Yeah but giving up their best defensive player, an important bench guy, and two young players for pretty washed LaMarcus Aldridge is an awful deal IMO. Aldridge's heinous defense combined with the Blazers heinous defense would be a basketball war crime."
I think the Spurs needs a LaMarcus Aldridge type player.
"Definitely not surprised you took a superhuman fluke play as Tatum not being clutch. You don‚Äôt know as much as you think, actually. Didn‚Äôt the Celtics go to game 7 with the raptors and win? Unless you‚Äôre arguing we dominated a 7 game series, again that wouldn‚Äôt be surprising coming from someone who knows the game as little as you.   The heat just peaked man, hope you had fun. It‚Äôs funny watching your team full of racists and domestic abusers (heat culture!!! Lol) not be good enough so your lame fans scramble to find the next guy. You‚Äôve went from Giannis, to Beal, to oladipo, to LaMarcus Aldridge LMAO. Have fun watching the Nets jog to the finals and see everyone realize how big the talent gap is between Harden and Wade when he wins a ring this year. People who know hoops already know Harden passed up that weirdo years ago."
Found a link to what I was talking about.  It was really hard not to laugh at these in real time during the games.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://twitter.com/jtakuz/status/1354896661953306630?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354896661953306630%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\_&amp;ref\_url=https%3A%2F%2Fairalamo.com%2F2021%2F01%2F29%2Fsan-antonio-spurs-lamarcus-aldridge-15-foot-defense%2F](https://twitter.com/jtakuz/status/1354896661953306630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354896661953306630%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fairalamo.com%2F2021%2F01%2F29%2Fsan-antonio-spurs-lamarcus-aldridge-15-foot-defense%2F)
LaMarcus Aldridge cannot win a ring as a starter. 25 minutes a game. Find a team that needs a 4/5 off the bench.
he's coming to portland. re-read this athletic article with quotes from Dame and LaMarcus and try and tell me that he's not coming home  [link](https://theathletic.com/864563/2019/03/12/mending-fences-damian-lillard-and-lamarcus-aldridge-forge-connection-on-precipice-of-blazers-milestone/?source=emp_shared_article)
"We lost 3 other starters BECAUSE LaMarcus decided to leave, so Olshey moved fast and went into full rebuild around Lillard. If he wanted to stay,  Paul Allen would have paid them all no questions asked.   And even if he just decided to leave,  fans would have understood, especially since we had Lillard to build around. The hate comes from the fact that coming into the season he put it out there in writing for all to see that he wanted to resign, then changed his mind but didn't tell the blazers until well into the offseason. Could have royally screwed over the blazers of they had resigned RoLo and a post Achilles Wes and then Aldridge just dipped."
Yes but it takes 2 to tango.   You seem to be expecting a better player than lamarcus aldrige to a) become available and b) their team not wanting to continue employing them.   Trade exceptions are notorious for being fools gold.  Hopefully yall find something good but imo aldridge is about as good as it gets in these situations.
"I remember when LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love and Blake Griffin were the best power forwards of the game."
"I feel like he was trying to get me to read ""Poop on LaMarcus Aldridge"""
Shout out to the Bulls and TWolves in that draft for letting us turn Tyrus Thomas and Randy Foye into LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy.
It was terrible.   [Our official social media team even retweeted it but had to delete it.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2510286-lakers-delete-their-lamarcus-aldridge-tweets-after-reported-unimpressive-meeting.amp.html)

"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2825332-lamarcus-aldridge-has-discussed-returning-to-trail-blazers-with-damian-lillard    Idk man he's seemed pretty eager to return to the Blazers for a while now. If I was a betting man it seems like the safest bet, there were rumors we might trade for him before this."
They put up a billboard for Lamarcus Aldridge??
"Who‚Äôs the best player from Texas? Jimmy Butler or Chris Bosh? Trae Young is from here too, so is LaMarcus Aldridge. Surprisingly few ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù from Texas though, but a lot of solid bench players. Can‚Äôt forget College Stations own A.C. Fresh either."
"Texas so it‚Äôs a choice between LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Bosh and Jimmy Butler. Jimmy peaked the highest of the three so I‚Äôll say Butler.  Edit: Ignore all that. My dumbass forgot Clyde Drexler."
If LaMarcus Aldridge gets enshrined into the HOF I will eat ghost peppers until I puke blood
Yeah that's exactly the point we're making. LaMarcus Aldridge should not make the HoF in my opinion. I think the NBA's hall of fame lets in too many people and it waters it down a bit.
"No? Traditional power forwards who can‚Äôt defend the perimeter slide up to the 5 nowadays. See: LaMarcus Aldridge, Porzingis, Derrick Favors, Ibaka, etc  Teams can‚Äôt afford to have more than one slow-footed big on the court, especially in the playoffs. Teams with good guards target them on switches and run them off the floor"
"I'm of the opinion that attendance in Minnesota in particular would be helped by them moving to the East, so they play more cities that people out there give a fuck about.  As far as attendance to teams that aren't currently good, that's part of it. Or, there are teams like the Wizards that have been flat attendance-wise for years. The last time they were in the top 5 in attendance is when Michael Jordan played there in 2002 and 2003.  Another point is that the Wizards and Pistons have some of the highest capacity arenas in the league. If they had arenas the size of Milwaukee, Brooklyn or Indiana, they'd look much better from a sellout perspective.  But, if Portland is any indication of what the league needs to do to make in person attendance more attractive, somehow getting a marketable star to teams every so often that people can't miss.  Portland was last in attendance in 2006. We drafted Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge and moved to 22nd in 2007. After drafting Greg Oden,  we were back to #7. 2009? #3 with an average crowd of 20,524 (102.7 percent capacity).  All it takes is a team the city can get behind and believe in."
"We're shopping our vets who're on expiring deals like Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Demar Derozan, Lamarcus Aldridge and potentially Trey Lyles as well.  I'm not expecting any of them to be getting traded, but those guys are on the table.   Spurs on in the middle of a rebuild, so makes sense to shop our vets. Patty and Demar have been excellent for us, so doubt Spurs will move them unless some irresistible offer comes along. Rudy and Trey Lyles are pretty useful pieces for teams looking to bolster their wing depth. Lamarcus is washed atm, so doubt we'll move him."
One name that isn‚Äôt mentioned is LaMarcus Aldridge. Dude was a part of 5 All-NBA teams for the decade and he‚Äôs a 7-time all-star.
