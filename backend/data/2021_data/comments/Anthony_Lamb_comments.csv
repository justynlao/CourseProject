"They just signed Anthony Lamb from the g league, maybe this is to make room for him?"
"If I remeber 2k16 correct Jeremy fucking lamb and anthony Randolph run the league. Giannis is d league, and luka is 61 overall as a euro player it 17?"
Anthony lamb
"How is it this close?  The Rockets have played Kevin Porter Jr., Ben McLemore, Sterling Brown, Jae'Sean Tate, Justin Patton, Kenyon Martin Jr., Anthony Lamb, David Dwaba, and Mason Jones tonight...against the team with the best record in the league that's playing at full strength."
Anthony Lamb who is the first ever player from the University of Vermont (in like 107 years of the program !) to get regular season NBA minutes!!  So thatâ€™s cool
HEY! Put some respect on my man Anthony Lamb. Went to college here in the great state of Vermont lol dude can ball Iâ€™m tellin you
Sterling Brown  KPJ  Justin Patton   Kenyon Martin Jr  Ben MacLemore  Mason Jones  Anthony Lamb or someone named like that  I forgot the 8th guy  Edit: JaSean Tate
I spent a few years watching Anthony Lamb at UVM. Any chance he's gonna stick?
I am a small man and I could be a better bench piece than Anthony Lamb
"lol I have unfortunately watched the whole ass game and im mystified why hes playing so passive... the Rockets tallest player is 6'6'' and we are currently running an 8 man roster of Anthony Lamb, Jeffries, KJ Martin, House, Khyri Thomas, Jae'Sean Tate, and Armoni Brooks. Y'all should be up 30 and Gobert should easily have a 20/20 game..."
They didn't even have a picture of Anthony Lamb on file. When they showed the starting line-up it was four faces and a Rockets-coloured NBA logo.
Wooohooooo Anthony Lamb!!
Good game 76er bros. You guys got a fucking squad. Good luck in the playoffs.   Avery Bradley is so fucking washed. Anthony Lamb and Kenyon Martin Jr. had very nice games though.
"The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package of now-DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman.   After a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James decided ""fuck it"" and proceeded to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers. He immediately traded Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the last seat. The team now paddles down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east.   Oubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership ""only play him in the hype minutes"" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.    The two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2"", is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 12 blocks and 18 rebounds per game.The cavaliers suffer two more losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey.   After a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.  Kelly Oubre takes off his jacket and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees.   The fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense they manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to stay in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron. LeBron, steps up to the line, but he knows Oubre's tricks. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, and LeBron laughs and drains the first free throw.   However, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. Everyone is staring at his knees. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, people are calling Oubre the goat while analysts are saying that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Oubre goes 1-4 in overtime but the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40"
"How about Ben Simmons to the Rockets for Anthony Lamb, Danuel House, and a 2026 SRP?"
"That's exactly how markets work. No one was ever getting absolutely ridiculous hauls with 5 years of picks for stars players until the Anthony Davis trade set a new market. Andrew Bynum a first and a second were enough to land Dwight Howard.  Houston got Harden for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two firsts and two seconds. Kyrie went to Boston for Isaiah Thomas, Ante Zizic and a first. The crazy pick heavy trades for PG, Westbrook and Harden only came after the AD trade set the market. It isn't a reach to think that teams may have been overvaluing and that the market may correct itself based on another trade."
"I guess Anthony lamb, with so many big names itâ€™s hard to tell that thereâ€™s even a worst player"
Disagree   Anthony Lamb got snubbed
Anthony Lamb got that Jared Sullinger body type
I didnt tune in to watch Luka Garza and Anthony Lamb duel  Give the ball to Cade
Anthony Lamb is the worst player Iâ€™ve ever seen
"Iâ€™d love to see him get a spot. I think Burly 3&amp;d wing types who are short are going to get more looks these days after the success that PJ Tucker has had. I look at guys like Ojeleye and Anthony Lamb and think that teams are actively pursuing that kind of guy these days.   Gelo could be a player in that mold that shoots it well, and can hold up on switches against bigger guys in the post. Heâ€™s not gonna have the help instincts, rebounding, and insane effort that Tucker has, but he could fill a similar role."
idk about the only guy fighting for rebounds. Anthony Lamb had more rebounds than Evan Mobley.
Anthony Lamb
Anthony Lamb
Armoni brooks and Anthony lamb
Anthony lamb tho ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶
Cade for Anthony Lamb and DJ Augustin  DJ-Hayes-Lamb-Bey-Stewert is a contender
&gt;This means either Tyler Bey or Anthony Lamb will be cut from one of the two-way contract spots.   We all know who will be the sacrificial Lamb
He's like a somehow even worse Anthony Lamb.
Got PTSD from the Jeremy Lamb game winner when Cole Anthony took the shot ðŸ˜­
