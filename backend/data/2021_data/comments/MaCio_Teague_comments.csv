"Are you serious? Those guys are teammates. Here’s another random collection of college players I would coalesce into one team: Davion Mitchell, Jared Butler, MaCio Teague, Mark Vital, Flo Thamba. Jeez, imagine those 5 together! They might even be able to beat this guy’s group!"
Marquis Teague And MaCio Teague
Are Marquis Teague and MaCio Teague related?
Davion Mitchell   MaCio Teague     Jared Butler    Flo Thamba    Mark Vital       This team sweeps all of them lol
"Historically: Tayshaun Prince, Shawn Marion  Coming soon: Macio Teague"
"The only names I recognize on this Jazz roster are Chealey (G-league journeyman), Justin Patton (big fall from grace), and MaCio Teague (2021 Undrafted). I've seen Malik Newman's and Jarell Martin's names before, too. However, the likelihood any of these guys end up in the G-league, let alone the NBA, is slim.  Jazz White has some of our roster guys, including Juwan Morgan (potential stretch 5 and on our main roster), Elijah Hughes (2nd round pick in 2020 and on our main roster), Jarrell Brantley (2nd round pick in 2019 and two-way last season), Udoka Azubuike (1st round pick in 2020, was our 3rd string center but got injured), and Trent Forrest (PG on a two-way with us last season). Other names I recognize include Dakota Mathias (was on the National Team practice squad) and Jawun Evans (played for Clippers a couple years ago). These guys are definitely much closer to being on rosters than the guys on Jazz White.  FYI, the Jazz White squad is playing against the Spurs summer league team now."

"100%. Even if we go to college basketball, Baylor is constructed the same way. 2 high level PnR guys (Mitchell and Butler) with a 3rd capable ballhandler and shooter in Macio Teague. It’s pick your poison. Oh you wanna stick your best guy on Mitchell? We’ll let Butler pick his matchup and attack.  Honestly that’s why I felt like the regular season win over the Hawks (during the heckling incident lmao) was a big one for the Lakers, cuz I felt like they were such a matchup challenge for any elite defense.  Y’all got an insanely talented squad. I could see a ECF type of run, and depending on Harden’s health, it could go even further. Now I’m not counting Philly out, cuz they are physical and experienced. But rn the Hawks are getting a good look every single time down the court. Everyone wants to compare Trae to Steph, but if anything he reminds me more of Nash. Elite reads and passing ability + floaters and runners in the lane to neutralize rim protection.  If Reddish becomes something and Hunter can stay healthy, it’s gonna be scary for the East."
