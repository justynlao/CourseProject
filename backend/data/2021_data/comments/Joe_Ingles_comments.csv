"They're doing it to stop Joe Ingles, let's get real."
And that's just Joe Ingles!
Joe Ingles SNUBBED AGAIN
Joe Ingles exists
Curry and Mike are lucky that Joe Ingles declined the invitation
So in 10 years he'll be Joe Ingles?
"With no respect to Duncan Robinson, I’d prefer Joe Ingles."
"You missed Joe Ingles, there had their gold and didn't even know it"
"They had Joe ingles and they let him slide to Utah, what idiots"
"This 3pt contest sucked tbh. Should've had actual shooters instead of stars. Need Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, Seth, etc. The guys that are actually there aren't really shooters but shot creators."
Joe Ingles is the best player on The Jazz
Pretty sure this is about Joe Harris and Joe Ingles
PG: Dragic  SG: Clarkson  SF: Joe Ingles  PF: Marcus Morris  C: Chris Boucher
"Dragic’s a good choice for sure.   I’d add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can’t remember), Shake Milton’s should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"
Blame it on Joe Ingles. He doesn’t think Mitchell is a star player. Way to pump up the confidence!  *This is sarcasm for the 69% of r/nba who didn’t get it without the footnote.
everytime he says joe referring to ingles I think he's talking about embiid
Joe ingles is the jazz best player
Joe ingles been hanging onto that hair for 10 years now lol
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles has said as much in past years when he was one of the top 5 shooters in the league.  He'd rather see his kids and take a breather.
"Jazz didn't play through Ingles enough, when Joe and Jimmy don't get double tec it's not a real game."
Cody Zeller or Joe Ingles
Steven Adams has to be my favorite current player that has never played for the Jazz.  I'd burn my family savings to finance a buddy cop movie with him and Joe Ingles.
"What about a white player like Joe Ingles who is nicknamed “slow mo Joe” for a lot of his actions but has a sneaky step on his pick n roll? I would consider him deceptively athletic. Not bc he’s white, but bc he looks like a rec league dad"
Whichever team that has Joe Ingles
Did you watch the series he had against Utah when he played for OKC? Joe Ingles and rookie Donovan Mitchell destroyed him. He actually scored just 2 points in the elimination game 6.
You forgot about Super Superstar and that can only belong to one man in the league. Joe Ingles.
"Mitchell was probably a little better last year than this year, and Bogey was better last year and this year. Gobert was also better last year than this year. All 3 have still been good this year.  Joe Ingles was average last year, but has been amazing this year. Jordan Clarkson was even better this year than last year (he should also be MIP). Mike Conley turned it on late last year, and he has been much better this year. Favors is a much better player than Bradley. Niang is more playable this year.  The Jazz have been playing this style of passing the ball around for quite some time, with occasional iso play. We just needed to hit our shots.  What people forget in that 2018-19 Houston series, we couldn't hit shit, and I felt we got better shots than Houston in Game 3 and 5."
"literally everything is better for them this year than it was last year  in terms of what changed on paper, healthy bojan, conley has adjusted to the system, favors is our backup centre now instead of tony bradley, and players like royce o'neale and joe ingles are even more willing to to shoot the three than they were before.  you can also point to some smaller improvements like mitchell is a more willing passer (even if his assist numbers aren't noticeably higher), gobert is putting in his best season ever defensively, clarkson has cleaned up his shot selection and is an actual human torch, georges niang is not a negative on defence anymore, snyder's rotations are a lot tighter and more effective as well"
and also the goat joe ingles
"Joe Ingles is a GOAT, not just some ""sneaky"" good player."
He'd be a Joe Ingles type player I feel
Joe Ingles will win the Joe Ingles Of The Year award for sure. The JIOTY.
"I’d love Joe Ingles to do it, but he’s been pretty vocal about wanting to move back to Australia the second he retires"
I would kill for Joe Ingles to be one of the Inside the NBA guys
Seems like they just open up the flood gates and all a sudden they're up by 20. They also have Joe Ingles.
"I hate Gobert, and I don’t care that much about Mitchell, but dammit man, I just can’t bring myself to dislike Joe Ingles."
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
Joe Ingles. It’s a dream
"Seems kind of Hasty to be giving the Jazz three all NBA slots. I mean Gobert and Joe Ingles, yeah. But Donovan Mitchell has work to do."
You left the GOAT Joe Ingles off your list.
Joe ingles
"Simmons, D'Angelo Russell, Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Julius Randle bench mob is still a good squad."
what is a Dylan Windler? A homeless man's Joe Ingles?
When the hell did Joe Ingles turn into Steph Curry
Lol I love Joe Ingles  Looks like a dentist but can slash you on the court
No way!   Joe Ingles? Patty Mills? Aron Baynes? Hugh Jackman? Steve Irwin?
"Joe Ingles snubbed off the snub list, wtf..."
"While Ingles doesn't have nearly the resume that Manu does, his numbers playing in Europe and for the Australian National Team are still pretty impressive: [https://www.basketball-reference.com/international/players/joe-ingles-1.html](https://imgur.com/uEi62i8)"
"Three Point contest is not for someone like Donovan Mitchell.. He'd struggle horribly  &gt;  Even Harden looked like shit in the 3pt contest.. These are extremely ""rhythm"" based shooters. They are mainly scorers, not pure sharpshooters  &gt;   Joe Ingles would have been a better option.. Don should have been in the Dunk Contest instead"
Joe Ingles in the 3pt contest would just be unfair.
I mean we are talking about Joe Ingles here. Probably start with Wilt. . .
"You can it’s old or it’s eye test it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a bullshit stat and anyone who gives it any credibility is a moron!   So Russ needs to tone down his volume because he’s inefficient as TS% would supposedly show But Joe Ingles who’s #2 in the league wouldn’t do well with increased volume. So what’s the point of the stat? To add 3 numbers and divide?   A 90% FT shooter is going to shoot 90% or there about whether you increase or decrease their volume.  Why is it TS%, if it’s “objective” &amp; shows “efficiency” Why can’t that be applied?   Here’s all you need to know about efficiency and how objective TS% is   All time list  Deandre Jordan is #2 all time  Steph #5 Adrian Dantley is #8 Kyle Korver #24  Lebron #46 Michael Jordan #98 Larry bird #112 Kobe #218  So you tell me who is more efficient at scoring The eye test or the bullshit stat crowd?"
Joe Ingles being 33 surprises me because he looks like hes in his 40s
"Im not implying it, I'm stating it. Some players can be good scorers at a stars' volume, like Jokic or Embiid or KD, and some are really bad as a star, like Russel Westbrook this year. Russ would definitely be a more efficient scorer if he were a role player who didn't handle the ball as much and took shots less often. Joe Ingles would be horribly inefficient as a main option, because he is only really good at catch and shoot threes and those opportunities come very well in his role. Using analytics and better stats have made the game better, and while you can't abandon the eye test or old fashioned scouting, throwing out something as simple as TS% is way too much of an old-head move."
I can't believe the disrespect you are showing Joe Ingles!
how is Joe Ingles 44 years old
Right? The disrespek to Slow Mo Joe Ingles
Joe ingles. Bojan bogdanavic
"So Jarrett Allen and Joe Ingles are #1&amp;2 in the league this year at about 70% &amp; this “objectively “ means they are more efficient scorers than let’s say  Lebron who is at #82 &amp; at 59.1%.  Or Blake Griffin who is ranked #188th &amp; at 49.1%. That’s objective in deciding who’s more efficient at scoring?   So if it’s “objective” then its the same measure as FT% where Chris Paul &amp; KAT are #1&amp;2 at 97.2% &amp; 94.6% The 82nd ranked player is Luguentz Dort at 74.7% How about even the 110th ranked since I can’t even look up the 188th quickly enough, Marvin Bagley at 54.5%. That’s the same equivalent?   Somehow we change a measure of efficiency by just adding up nonsense &amp; averaging out and giving it a lie for a name.  It’s not “true shooting” it’s FALSE shooting.   GTFO!! with what ever idiot taught people this trash.  People who watch and follow the game forever &amp; know what it’s about would never even look at TS% as a real stat.   It’s another nonsensical advanced statistic that doesn’t measure anything just some stupid number we can add to try to act like baseball advanced statistics."
A race between Joe Ingles and Big Honey has never been scheduled because scientists are not sure of the implications for the time/space continuum.
" &gt;	Two defensive centers - Gobert and Ayton.    Really understating how much better Gobert is than Ayton. Guys like mikal bridges and Cameron Payne are inexperienced, while Joe Ingles, Bojan, Derrick Favors, Jordan Clarkson all have experience."
"Joe Ingles, voters just embarrassed that they don’t want to get jingled"
Joe Ingles and we’re hittin the bar first
Joe ingles ball fake to layup
I’d have to say Klay Thompson  Edit: also love watching Joe Ingles play. He looks like he should be playing a church ball game and here he is locking people up in the NBA
"I'd argue his greatest value was that Utah signed fellow Aussie Joe Ingles to a roster spot as a ""mentor"" to help Exum feel more comfortable with the franchise, Haha."
"PG; John Stockton  SG: Joe Ingles   SF: Andrei Kirilenko   PF: Karl Malone   C: Derrick Favors   Honorable mentions: Mitchell, Gobert, and Okur"
joe ingles is fucking clean yeesh
"He's a physical liability and can be reckless with the ball at times. The last few weeks he's been the new Joe Ingles in terms of smarts and threes. If he and or Ingles are on, jazz slaughter"
"I mean unless you're Joe Ingles, pretty sure 90% of the league's players would be useless without their athleticism"
joe ingles prolly
the sundance award winning ingles documentary in 2029 really needs that shot from joe
Joe Ingles will

"We're averaging the most 3 pointers per game by any team in NBA history and our rotation players, minus the big men, just shoot an insanely efficient clip on high volume. I'll repost this table from another comment, that's accurate as of the completion of tonights game.     |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"
Michael Jordan and Joe Ingles
"We've got shooters everywhere that it's kinda ridiculous that Niang is only the 7th best shooter (by % this year even tho he's at 41.0% and 40.0% the last two seasons) in our rotation, apart from Gobert and Favors.      |Player|G|3P|3PA|3P%| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Joe Ingles|27|68|147|**46.26%**| |Royce O'Neale|31|53|126|**42.06%**| |Mike Conley|25|70|170|**41.18%**| |Bojan Bogdanović|31|78|200|**39.00%**| |Donovan Mitchell|29|98|252|**38.89%**| |Jordan Clarkson|31|100|263|**38.02%**| |Georges Niang|31|37|101|**36.63%**|"

Joe Ingles sighting in the Rubio video!
You know I love Joe Ingles as much as the next guy but do you really think he’s that good?
"How do you defend Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley"

Re: Ingles - with him coming off the bench you'll also note that Rudy's offense drops off as well. Conley and Mitchell are just not as effective in incorporating Rudy in the offense as Joe is.
Ya. Joe Ingles got robbed.
Joe Ingles used emus to keep the Jazz players in check
Joe Ingles
"Dame  Marcus Smart  Jerami Grant  RoCo  Bam   Bench: Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Royce O Neale, Richaun Holmes"
Bam Adebayo   Larry Nance   Mikal Bridges   Joe Ingles  It's defense floor spacing and maybe the biggest one is getting a big who can really playmake and destroy defenses for blitzing Dame off the short roll.
Joe Ingles played a crucial role in fixing things.
"Okay, use a teams seeding while ignoring literally every other factor to determine how good a player is. Joe Ingles and Kyle Kuzma are better than Luka. You’re a genius.   UNSUBSCRIBE."
Like how Paul George is Joe Ingles’ son
"Also Herro, Duncan Robinson, Vucevic, Joe Harris, Connaughton, Redick, Grayson Allen, Bertans and Ingles."
If we get 2/4 can you still tattoo either Joe or Ingles? Hahaha
i'll tattoo Joe Ingles on my wiener if 4 of those happen

"&gt; But he never said that he’s not a star, he said that he’s not a superstar.  Again, the issue isn't Shaq not thinking he's a superstar.  I'd frankly agree that he isn't on that level yet.  It's Shaq saying to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get to that level.  Which is frankly a dick move, and which was obviously Shaq trying to 'provoke' him into becoming one so he could take credit.  Which he's already trying to do.    And going further, shit, the product is supposed to be about the stars of today.  Shaq's retired and is a basketball analyst: dude shouldn't be making it about himself.    &gt;I’m only talking about his overall take on Mitchell.  I've got no issue with his take on Mitchell (basically, that he's not a superstar), and as I've said I agree with that take.    I do have issue with his blatantly trying to take credit, his attention whoring, his pettiness, and his basically just being insecure AF.    &gt;I meant nobody in this specific thread  Sure, because his whole endgame was obvious from the start.  But his whole plan to take credit being obvious shouldn't mean we can't criticize him for it.    &gt;Yeah once again it’s less about Joe and more about the fan reaction.   Again though, Joe was clearly joking.  And if you want to bring up Ingles' Tweets / IG posts we'd then have to bring up Shaq's drama on IG, which is unequivocally worse.    &gt;so we would see an even larger “remember when Jazz fans were mad Shaq said Donovan isn’t a superstar lololol”  That'd be a massive misrepresentation of what actually happened, but honestly we're pretty used to that from this sub at this point."
"Kyrie and Harden are going to be targeted in drop coverage come playoff time, it's the same thing the Rockets did year after year to Donovan Mitchell/Joe Ingles with Capela in the PNR"

"reading all this makes me glad i don’t have to hear “bonjour” when gobert blocks someone and “g’day mate” when joe ingles sinks a 3.  not that it’s really offensive, it just sounds annoying."
Haha Mike Conley washed  Bojan Bogdanovic? More like Bojan.. uh.. BetterStartHittingQuick lmao  Jordan Clarkson? Loser who is a loser with ugly tattoos  Joe Ingles has been jingled  Royce O'Neale wants to be Shaq so bad he changed his last name
Bruh you ever seen Joe Ingles play?
"Yeah It’s definitely not a coincidence this sub decided guys like Joe Ingles, boban, and Aaron Baynes are all lovable characters"
Caruso is like the lovechild of Cody Zeller and Joe Ingles lol
"ah yes, joe ingles was the one giving paul george trouble that series. not, you know, a certain 7 foot frenchman. he had one awful shooting night and you assume ingles had anything to do with it lmao. he averaged 28 points on 45/41/88 splits the first 5 games, joe sure did a great job there!"
Joe Ingles the white mamba!
Paul George put up 25/6/3 on 41/37/86 against Joe Ingles in the playoffs
I don't at all think the Clippers matchup better with the Jazz. Joe Ingles eats Paul George's lunch in the playoffs.
"Playoff P cant help but let his father, Joe Ingles, win."
Joe Ingles in Utah
How is that wack Joe Ingles is incredible
*clears throat* Joe Ingles is like... our 5th or 6th best player.  Clippers have one player that’s a problem.
Joe friccin Ingles... ya moron.
"It’s a justified sentiment though. Coming from soccer, it’s almost impossible to get even a scholarship without playing for a top high school or pay-to-play travel team. And that’s with soccer rosters being almost double a basketball roster and a heavier reliance on minor league talent pipelines. Hockey is basically the same. With smaller rosters and the rise of AAU teams in basketball, there are most definitely a lot of Joe Ingles out in the world.  Hot take prediction: the NBA American talent on average will decline and average International talent will increase, possibly overtake American talent because these youth teams don’t have the best talent, they have the wealthiest talent."
"You can't look at just raw stats dude.  I watched those Jazz teams, shit, Stockton sent the Jazz to the NBA Finals during my High School Graduation.  The starters for the 97 team would jump out on the current team, but dude go look at the bench those Finals teams had. There's nobody there that's going to really slow down Jordan Clarkson and guys like Joe Ingles tended to exploit them (Eddie Johnson and Vernon Maxwell often would magically get hot against Utah) and Sloan's schemes tended to leave shooters open--- Snyder's system generates the most open looks in the league.  Stockton and Malone are far better than anyone on the current roster is, but Hornacek isn't better than Conley, Mitchell, Gobert, Bojan, or maybe even Clarkson. Bryon Russell would be the 90's teams 4th best player and he's about the Royce O'Neale/Ingles tier who is solid but you'd have 6-7 players from the modern team that are as good or better than the 97's 4th best guy."

Bogdanovic looks like the evil version of Joe Ingles
"To be honest,  The Lakers are the only team the really worries me.  The Jazz have the clippers number and Joe Ingles is very good at taking Paul George out of the game."
"If you were picking two people to represent the state of Utah, Joe Ingles and John Stockton could not look more the part."
"Conley is shooting a career high on attempts and percentage. He’s a 37% shooter. He’s currently at 42%.   Donavon Mitchell is a career 36%. Hes at 39.5%, again, on a career high attempts.   Royce Oneale - 38% on his career. Currently at 44.6% on a career high in attempts.   Joe Ingles - 40% on career, currently 44.7%...  Clarkson - 34.5% on career, currently at 39% on a career high in attempts ...  All their shooters are scorching despite going up in attempts which is extremely rare in basketball. That is not sustainable.   And that’s the same for the Clippers."

"It's funny because Ingles WAS brought in to do just that! Haha.  Ofc it helped that he could play, but let's be honest, Joe Ingles never makes a Jazz roster if Dante Exum isn't drafted by them at #5 in 2014."
There's an ongoing joke amongst jazz fans that Joe ingles is Paul George's daddy. PG may be better on paper but I'm not worried if Ingles is guarding him.   The talent of Utah's defense should be considered.
"[""I'm shooting it.""---Joe Ingles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyczzOy4hn8)"
"We have advantages in the backcourt, bigs, and bench. There are too many pick and roll ball handlers on the Jazz for the Clippers to account for. Beverley's aggressive defense is a detriment against Conley and Mitchell because both of them have become patient playmakers. Paul George for whatever reason can't stop Joe Ingles.   The Clippers have fantastic perimeter defenders, but help defense is always more important than perimeter defense. The moment one of Jackson, Kennard, Williams, or Zubac are on the court, the Jazz will exploit that matchup. The drop off between their ""good"" and ""bad"" defenders is bigger than any contending team. There are also just too many playmakers on the Jazz to account for without elite help defense at all times on the floor."

"I never even said Joe Ingles was a primary facilitator, I said he can initiate the offense and can make plays for others, which he can. But if you think Donovan Mitchell is your best passer, you are seriously underrating what Mike Conley is actually doing for your team.  Again, nothing you said counter my argument about how Gobert brings something far more irreplaceable than Mitchell. I'm not saying Mitchell isn't a great player, but Utah is simply a talented team with guards and wings, and Rudy Gobert is a completely game changing defensive player and maybe one of these best pick and roll finishers in the league. Meanwhile, you have few other very good PnR ball handlers outside of Mitchell.  BTW: Ingles has averaged 5.2 assists over the last 4 years on less turnovers than Mitchell who has averaged 4.1 assists. For someone who's had the ball in his hands so much, he's not some type of elite passer for your team. Just look in the thread and see what most of your fellow Jazz fans are even saying."
"I don't mean this condescendingly but that's a really easy-to-parrot narrative that just isn't reflective of Donovan's impact at all. When you are arguing Joe Ingles as a primary facilitator, (even though he has played well recently) you are really just underestimating what Donovan does for us in terms of pace, passing, energy, and pure scoring."
"What Donovan Mitchell brings to the floor is far more replaceable than Gobert. Your entire defensive system rides on Gobert's presence as a rim protector. Utah has guards who can score and create shots with Conley and Clarkson. With a team with so many very good shooters, Conley's ability as a passer and getting guys in their spots is even more valuable than Mitchell's scoring. They also have a wing in Joe Ingles who can initiate the offense and make plays for others."
"Less hero ball and dribbling eating up time on the clock rather than getting into actions that create an advantage. Bojan is slowly getting better physically off his injury, but mostly he is making smarter plays in this category than he was before the win streak.  Defensive focus has been a lot better from the guards. Early in the season there were too many plays where a guard wouldn't even try to stay in front of their man. They would put Rudy in a position where he had to guard his man and theirs. Which he is the best in the league at, but not something you should be forcing him to do because you barely got in a defensive stance.   Also, Joe Ingles discovered his lightning quick crossover that puts grown ass men on the floor /s"
The Jazz have some sneaky athletic players when it comes to Joe Ingles and Bojan. They’re the types of guys you want to date your daughter
Joe Ingles.
"&gt;I watch the Pels way more than you do lmao.  That's literally not possible, as should be obvious by now.  &gt;You use little comments like “single coverage” to discredit any basket he makes.  No, that's called being specific.  When he's doubled, I note that as well -- but teams almost never double him, so you rarely see that comment.  &gt;It’s kind of insane that depth you go through to be a fucking hater.   You should go to more depth and learn something.  &gt;I’ve seen, with my own eyes, him get tough baskets  Everyone in the NBA scores tough baskets sometimes.  The fact remains that Williamson's shooting percentage inside 3' is poor, exactly because he struggles against NBA defenses.  You can look that number up with ""your own eyes"".  &gt; I don’t give a fuck who was guarding him.  You should.  &gt;I’ve seen him do it against the leagues best.   No, you see him do it against Joe Ingles, and Markieff Morris... but you don't pay attention to that, as you already admitted."

Joe Ingles plays like a completely different player when he starts. I think he feels a lot more pressure to perform.
Gobert with 29pts 20 rebounds.  Joe Ingles 7-11 from deep.  Jordan Clarkson off the bench 31pts in 33 minutes. Clarkson for 6MOY

"Utah has 4 guys who can consistently drop 20+ a game, a DPOY and good pieces like Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale who have been shooting 40% from deep.  The Warriors have no real bench. Utah can go 7 deep with starting caliber players."
Joe Ingles
SLEEPY JOE INGLES
"Yo dude, if you're getting highlights can you please post Joe Ingles' chase down blocks on Oubre at around the 8:10-8:00 remaining mark of the second quarter."
Almost like Paul George having parents named Paul George and Joe Ingles
To further this point to the guy who mentioned that Joe Ingles has done it 15 times in that span. One. Joe is a great passer. Two. Donovan has improved his passing a lot since games were suspended. He is averaging 4.9 which is close to what Rubio was averaging in Utah's system. Sure the passer Donovan was in the playoffs against the Rockets wasn't good enough but he is starting to do it pretty consistently now. So for them to check the stats and see only 1 game over 10 assists shows that 1. they don't know about Quin's system and 2. They are using out dated criticisms.
"It was Joe Ingles, I believe."
"Hey, now that the Clippers cut him, the Jazz can pick him back up for some of Joe Ingles magic.  Although getting ""Reyjonned"" doesn't have the same ring to it."

"[The Jazz right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/7drHiqr).  It's legit great to see it all coming together for Utah (not that they haven't been good in years past, but they've always felt like they only hit 80% of what they could do in the past).  Quin is a really, really good coach.  Spida Micthell is a star and keeps getting better (his vision gets better every day, I swear).  I wouldn't have maxed Gobert but he's great and impacts the game, and he looks much better when he's actually catching the ball all the time.  Imagine not liking Joe Ingles, is that even possible?  Bojan is a bomber and getting Favors back has really helped.  And Mike Conley is back &amp; then some, again imagine not liking him.  You love to see it."
"This will seem like a hot take, but this year it has been:  1. Conley - Mike has been totally consistent and has run fantastic offense and been gritty on defense. 2. Gobert - Along with Conley, Gobert anchors bench-majority lineups during the end of 1/3rd quarters and at the beginning of 2/4th quarters. These lineups have been fantastic for the Jazz and they have been totally solid during these minutes. 3. JC - Jordan has bent his shot chart to perfection and Coach Q puts him in perfect spots. He is giving awesome effort on defense  4. Mitchell - Don always gets his points and has been improving the last 5ish games and is likely to end the year 1b with Gobert 1a. 5. Ingles - Even missing some games, Joe is casting and making and has benefitted greatly from having his favorite PnR running mate, Favors, back on the team."
by that logic Donovan Mitchell should be MVP! Rudy Gobert should be MVP! Joe Ingles is in that discussion too

There's no way Simmons wins over Gobert. And Joe Ingles and Clarkson might split the vote so someone else might take it.
Hilarious that you posted some Joe Ingles stat line on here two weeks ago. Just salty over the L I imagine
"What /u/Yosemitehills was probably trying to say is that Ingles plays a lot of his minutes with the starting crew along with actually starting if anyone is out. His advanced stats are way high because 1) he's shooting lights-out this year and 2) he's on the floor with Gobert a lot, who is a plus/minus God this year. That carryon helps Ingles.  I'm just happy that we have two dudes who legitimately could win 6MOY.  JC started out the year at his all-time best scoring efficiency. That's regressed a bit since. He's not tasked with being efficient, though. He's tasked with being volume scoring off the bench. A good game for Joe is 3/5 for 9 points and 4 assists. A good game for JC is 8/15 and 20 points. Just different roles."
"Bro I hate people arguing this Gobert over Jokic nonsense when Gobert also has 3 great perimeter defenders in Royce O'Neal, Joe Ingles, and Mike Conley. Also has an insane primary scorer in Donovan Mitchell, the best 3 point shooting team in the league, a player on pace to set the TS% record, a 6MOTY candidate, and is the 4th scorer on his team.   I was hard rooting for the Jazz because I liked their team design and wanted to see the West shaken up, but their Reddit fans are becoming intolerable. Yesterday I'm arguing with someone who thinks Gobert is a top 10 player, now I'm seeing Gobert over Jokic as if he single handedly guarantees a top 3 defense"
"To be fair the ball movement was dead all game and I think Phoenix's physical defense had a lot to do with that. They didn't give our shooters any room and were excellent staying disciplined when collapsing on the drive so it wasn't easy to kick to a shooter. Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles only had 7 total shots combined, that's a lot to do with how the Suns defended us."
Donovan Mitchell looks pretty nice and Gobert   And tbf Joe Ingles ugly ass looks intimidating af
Swiggity swoogity Joe Ingles comin for that booty
Joe Ingles
"Hopefully not, he probably didn't deserve it over Joe Ingles or Thaddeus Young even when he was playing really well."
I need to see kyle anderson and Joe ingles on the same team some day. Maybe with Jokic.
"Joe Ingles  He is an elite shooter, elite in the pick n roll, can run your offense, a solid smart defender. And to top it off he is great in the locker room."
Joe Ingles is the only right answer
Not European but indulge me to throw my countryman Joe Ingles in with those guys as well.
Joe Ingles does not start at SF for Utah. He plays a mixture of SF and PG off the bench.   Royce O'Neal starts at SF and is a low volume high accuracy 3 point shooter and lockdown wing defender. He probably has an outside shot at all defense 2nd team.

PG got smoked by Joe Ingles. Shit was sad
Joe Ingles. Dad bod best bod.
"Recently bias tends me to go Joe, but the volume scoring off the bench by Clarkson I *think* has been more important for us winning a few games that have gotten close/might have lost and we dearly needed a bucket.   I can think of a handful of games before ASG we def woulda lost without Clarkson, whereas Ingles has just been steady efficient.  I’m gonna go with Clarkson but it ain’t easy"
"both have been great for us this year. Ummm I think if you ask me today I'd give that award to Joe, Clarksons been great but has regressed the last month or so, ingles has been pure fire"
Joe Ingles for MVP
Joe ingles
Jinglin’ Joe Ingles is the only answer
"The real answer here (for guys that are actually role players, not Klay Thompson) is Joe Ingles"
I thought that was Joe Ingles :/
"I understand that. But that's why he's a good scorer and not elite. Joe ingles is not a good scorer, he's ok. Elite is elite efficiency AND volume."
"It’s the other way around. It gets harder and harder to score efficiently on higher volume. For example, you can’t just extrapolate Joe Ingles insane TS% and say he should shoot 15 more shots a game, his TS% would fall dramatically. Donovan has shown what it takes in various situations to lead a team - the notion that his weakness of “inefficiency” makes him the third most valuable on a team would be laughed out of the room by any GM"

Just joe ingles 5 times
"Joe Ingles lives in the governors mansion here in Utah. He didn't have to buy it, we just gave it to him.  (Fun fact about Joe, his real house in SLC has an outdoor court with the green seats from the Delta Center when they did the remodel a couple years ago)"
"He has the 10th best 3 point percentage in the league, and the only players who average a higher percentage with more makes are Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, and Marcus Morris. He also has a lot more to his offensive game than a typically shooter.  So I’d say he is one of the best shooters, but he does get the benefit of open looks from his team (same with Ingles, Harris, Morris, and just about every shooter)."
Like Joe Ingles is marketable
"Joe Ingles was cut by the clippers and now leads the league in true shooting, and is Paul George's father. Royce O'neale was undrafted and joined the Jazz at age 26. He's now a starter."
Joe Ingles
Joe ingles is a glue guy you never trade the glue guy
"Basically Joe Ingles' approach to basketball too, you love to see it."
Mike Conley is playing like Mike Conley again. Mitchell has raised his game yet again. Bojan is back from injury. Gobert is playing the best season of his career. Joe Ingles is leading the league in TS%. Jordan Clarkson has become an automatic bucket off the bench. Gobert’s backup minutes are going to Derrick Favors instead of Tony Bradley.  Plus we were already the best 3pt shooting team in the league last year and simply decided to turn that up to 11.  We’re really just firing on all cylinders at every position this season... except our 3rd stringers. They’ve turned many 30 points blowouts into 15 point wins this season.
Joe Harris  Duncan Robinson   Joe Ingles   Buddy Hield
"I mean just going by this season 3-point shooting:  Joe Ingles- 50% on 5.5 Attempts per game Joe Harris- 48.2% on 6.7 attempts a game Duncan Robinson- 40.4% on on 8.6 attempts per game.   Huge drop off there in percentage. Just got some perspective Donovan Mitchell is shooting 40.3% on 8.6 attempts, nearly identical to Robinson and he’s been known as a chucker. So yes there’s a drop off after Ingles and Harris."
Jingling Joe Ingles is easily the best player out of the lot and I don't want to hear anyone say any different.
1. Duncan 2. Joe ingles 3. Joe Harris 4. Buddy Hield
My man Joe Ingles would be a got damn Euro League MVP now.
Joe Ingles is much much better now than back then. If he went back rn he would tear it up. Shane Larkin and Mike James are considered the 2 best players in Euroleague. Muscala definite has a chance to be top 10 there
"Joe Ingles was not top 10 player in Euroleague,i doubt Muscala would but who knows look Larking how good he is playing"
"If anything, Joe Ingles would be considered before McConnell, but props off the to the dude, he is playing well"
"Wow. Mitchell is absolutely incredible. Joe Ingles is better then Joe Harris. Jordan Clarkson is a star coming off the bench. This team is incredible. By the way, they won by 46. Now obviously it’s the Magic, but beating ANY TEAM by 46 is impressive."
Because Joe Ingles is running away with it
Joe Ingles has the sexiest shot in the game.
Because people still equate the award to best scorer off the bench.  Which is wrong.  TJ has been arguably the best backup pg in the NBA and as a regular season player he has significant value even though he's kinda unplayable in the playoffs.  Still that said Joe Ingles is the clear 6moty idn my book.
It’s not at all. Joe Ingles can condition himself just as well as Curry. That doesn’t make him athletic.
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez

It really should go to Joe Ingles.
Goran Dragic  JJ Redick  Joe Ingles  Draymond Green  Kevin Love
I’m going to go with C. Joe Ingles. The dude has the highest true shooting percentage in NBA history and is shooting 50% from 3. Clarkson is perfect for his role in Utah but Ingles is a god
Joe Ingles
"that is crazy. he's good  another interesting stat: 5 of the top 25 seasons, as measured by TS%, are happening this year  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_season.html  1st. Joe Ingles  12th. Ivica Zubac  22nd: Richaun Holmes  23rd: Jarret Allen  25th: Joe Harris"
I fucking love Joe Ingles!!!
Joe Ingles is having one of the most efficient seasons ever and he’s not even a big man
"Joe ""highest TS of all time"" Ingles is always hot apparently."
Joe Ingles is God
If Joe Ingles isn’t on your list I don’t want to see it
He was also a game time decision. And so was Joe ingles. I’ll let you draw the conclusion.
"Imagine if the Jazz makes it to the finals. Mitchell and Joe Ingles are gonna have to turn into KD and Steph to take down 2 LA teams, Suns, Nuggets, maybe Mavs."
I need Jazz-Nets in the Finals. Joe Harris vs Joe Ingles
"I used to say I wish I had Jordan Clarkson confidence, but I think I really want Joe Ingles confidence 😍"
Glad Joe ingles is one of the good guys
Joe Ingles give me Reggie Miller trash talking vibes. I love it
"warriors fans, whos that joe ingles looking guy? he doesnt look good."
plus you can safely risk up to like 5 Joe Ingles’ getting ejected
Embiid and 14 Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles tweets are full of responses from Jazz fans. “So glad we have players like you that our kids actually can look up to. You are a shining example of what an athlete should be.”  It’s not hard to read between the lines on what they’re insinuating.
I gotchu. [joe ingles show](https://1280thezone.com/the-joe-ingles-show-with-dj-pk-volume-7-episode-12-april-1-2021/)
"Damn, doubt I'll be able to find that.  Edit: [I stand corrected.](https://1280thezone.com/the-joe-ingles-show-with-dj-pk-volume-7-episode-12-april-1-2021/)"
"&gt;He isn't shooting efficiently from all over the floor - his eFG% is like 51st in the league, he is efficient at the line and that brings up his TS%.  Ok fine, I will admit from looking at his shooting splits there's a chance he's below average from 3-10 feet. Other than that though he's good at the rim, probably slightly above average from 10-16 feet, maybe one of the best season ever from 16 ft to 3, and very good from 3. His eFG is 51st out of 125 which given his volume is good.  &gt;Elite scorers are guys that have both high eFG% AND TS%. Making FT's does not make someone an elite scorer.  I don't get this argument. If a hypothetical player scored 50 PPG just from free throws I would say they are elite at scoring. Scoring means scoring points, and free throws get you points. If you want to see who the elite scorers in this league are, look at the league leaders in PPG. If you look at guys with high eFG% and TS% then again you think the elite scorers in the league are Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, and Richaun Holmes. Being able to shoot matters of course, but being able to score is more important when we're talking about scoring."
Joe Ingles said he texted his wife about what happened and then immediately lost service.
"They have a strong correlation, but they're not the same thing. Take a look at the [league leaders in TS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) as an example. Do you think that Joe Ingles, Ivica Zubac, Richaun Holmes, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris are elite scorers? No, they're good in a more limited role. If they needed to shoot as much as someone like Embiid their efficiency would likely crater. Being an elite scorer requires being efficient at a high volume. So yes, they're related, but they're not the same thing."
"The flawed thinking is more about underrating skill and basketball IQ.   Everybody thinks your ceiling is limited if you don't have elite athleticism when that's just not true, look at Jokic, Luka, even somebody like Joe Ingles.   Basketball IQ often manifests itself in how good of a passer you are, and if you are a Luka/LaMelo-level passer, you're going to be a superstar in today's NBA with the way offense is played now, and the spacing that teams have, and it's incredible that teams did not realize that."
Joe Ingles isn't the GOAT
"1. Rudy 2. Mitchell 3. Conley 4. Clarkson 5. Bojan Bogdanovich 6. Joe Ingles 7. Royce O'Neale 8. **Derrick Favors** 9. **Georges ""Minivan"" Niang**"
Joe Ingles
"Joe Ingles.  Not even being sarcastic, he is a joy to watch."
"Joe Ingles and Glenn Robinson III just becomes like, Paul George right"

Joe Ingles
"See the reality is kids of superstars almost never live up to the hype. Now kids of role players? I’m looking at Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker, Damontas Sabonjs. Oh yeah let me get some Joe Ingles and mash it up with a little Matysse Thybulle hmmm"
"Curry might be the best player in the series but the Jazz will have the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and possibly 5th and 6th (depending how you view Joe Ingles and Jordan Clakrson against Wiggins and current Draymond) best players in the series. And that's not even mentioning Royce O'Neal, 3+D guy."
&gt;Khris Middleton   &gt;   &gt;Kyle Lowry   &gt;   &gt;Joe Ingles  You can't tell me which one of these is the definitive #1 on the team though
"Kristaps Porzingis   OG Anunoby   Khris Middleton   Kyle Lowry  Mike Conley   Bench:   Joe Ingles, Thad Young, Rudy Gay, Danillo Gallinari, Maxi Kleber, Chris Boucher, Derrick Rose   Would this team win 60 games? Idk but it would win alot"

Why is Joe Ingles so salty lmao
"not going to lie, if there's a top 5 of nba players I'd like to have a beer with, Joe Ingles would be in that short list."
Forgot   **Jinglin' Joe Ingles**\--I probably don't need to explain this one. Watching him succeed on the court is like watching a guy my age (Old) fuck around and get a triple double on the playground. The laws of motion and physics have no jurisdiction over ground-bound plumber bod Joe.
r/nba: Bro where is Brian Scalabrine Alex Caruso Tacko Fall Joe Ingles and Bol Bol?
Joe Ingles
My favorite player exactly 10 years ago was Paul Millsap. Now its 100% Joe Ingles.
I think Joe Ingles should be 1st team over Giannis and Kawhi too. Put Facu over Steph while we’re at it.
"NBL defenders are capable.   The biggest things international teams are missing is generally elite shot creation and elite physical talent because a lot of those guys get poached. The defence is normally okay, plus they generally play with a smaller 3PT line and fewer defensive restrictions in the paint so things can get a little cramped.  A lot of those guys are the same guys who gave Team USA trouble in the World Cup. Yes, we had NBA guys in that team, but the NBA and NBL guys were both holding their own defensively.   As others mentioned, we've seen NBA talent like Melo play well but he wasn't hyper dominant.  Think of the NBL like a league of smaller, less offensively talented Joe Ingles-es. Not elite athletically but scrappy and can still give NBA players problems defensively.   Plus some Brad Wanamakers thrown into the mix.  ***  To answer OP's question.   LeBron would be the easiest answer. They just don't have the size to match up against him. Instead of throwing 6'8-6'9 big physical bodies at him, they'd be throwing 6'5 Joe Ingles-es.   They'd play scrappy and coordinated but LeBron would body them.  Likewise, if I'm just looking at my own team, I'd say Jaylen probably does better than Jayson would. He's more physically dominant in the way he plays.  Maybe Curry or Dame would be interesting because of their shooting abilities. They could bypass a lot of the interior clogging."
"You realize it is next 3 years, so what you’re saying is the last year of this hypothetical situation. Joe Ingles and Bogdanovic’s game translates with age."
I’m pretty sure that’s joe ingles but I see your point
I know they aren’t current power ranking. Three years isn’t that far into the future and the Jazz have almost all of their current team locked up for the next couple of years. Bojan and Joe Ingles are the only aging players on the Jazz and neither of them have games that require athleticism.
"Nobody seriously compares the TS% of a primary option with a role player. Like I don't think anyone considers Joe Ingles one of the best scorers in the NBA. It does show that Ingles is as good as just about anyone at his role of spot up shooter. I don't think it's a big leap to think that most people can look at volume and efficiency combined to contextualize things. That doesn't change that DeRozan is not an elite volume scorer, despite many of his shots having a high degree of difficulty."
Joe Ingles
"Since he entered the league MPJ is top 10 in eFG% and 4th this season. He’s basically Joe Ingles/Joe Harris but younger, taller, and more athletic. The Nuggets were smart to draft him and lucky he’s heathy"
"Yes it does, it's why players like Joe Harris and Ingles don't just shoot 15 3s a game, it's hard to get that many shots up. If they tried, their efficiency would dip.  Simple way to put it:  Average efficiency + average volume = average shooter  Average efficiency + high volume = above average shooter  High efficiency + average volume = above average shooter  High efficiency + high volume = elite shooter  It's pretty straightforward imo."
Australians really like Joe Ingles too

An overpaid white perimeter player who can shoot the ball and is not a liability on defense. So many of them in the league right now. Joe Ingles is hands down the best and he actually deserves all the money he gets.
"You're not taking into account the roles each player has, Jordan Clarkson has the second highest usage on the team whereas Joe Ingles is ranked 12th.   Clarkson's entire role is to come off the bench and lead the second unit by being super aggresive. Joe Ingles (who has started almost half the games he's played this season) is not the primary scorer whether he's starting or coming off the bench, when starting he would be the fourth option behind Mitchell, Conley and Bojan.   I'm not saying Ingles isn't a good player but there's a reason he is far more efficient while scoring less than Clarkson, they have two completely different roles."
"Boban, Steven Adams, joe Ingles"
Any team with Joe Ingles is a legit threat
"Damn, Joe Ingles was completely covered by Draymond on that 3, impressive."
Gobert is actually really impactful on offense as a PNR lob threat and generally is an exceptional pick setter. Joe Ingles/Gobert PNR is deadly and that’s just with Ingles not someone like Luka
"im curious what you think was bad about the jazz process?  excellent drafting, excellent scouting of unheralded royce oneale and joe ingles types, great internal improvement year over year  the jazz didnt just get lucky this year, its been coming you just didnt notice"
"Skill boost: gobert+shot=duh  Athleticism: Joe ingles, really just a bonus to solidify his goat status.  Size boost: Mitchell, so then he can dunk it with his teeth"
Joe Ingles. A 12 part mini series.
Joe Ingles when starting (so anytime Mitchell or Conley have missed time):  15.7p 5.9a 3.8r 49/46/84 shooting
Lmao you werent watching that series then bc PG (a top defender)  was getting cooked by Joe Ingles all series and Westbrick was worse than Rubio dude shot us out of everygame he literlly took 40+ shots with Melo and PG on the team 😂💀
Bryce Cotton played in the NBA. LaMelo Ball wasn't even close to top 5 NBL players last season and is now starting in the NBA. Joe Ingles is currently one of the best players on the number one seeded team in the NBA and he started his career and played many seasons in the NBL. JaeSean Tate got called up to the Rockets. Cam Oliver just this week signed a contract. Broekhoef has played NBA. The only way to really find out best leagues would be a champions league type contest which had never happened.
"Skill boost: Royce Oneale, Height Boost: Donovan Mitchell, Athleticism boost: joe Ingles"
"Donovan size boost. 6'4"" Donovan would be strong as fuck, super athletic and a much better finisher at the rim so more efficient.   Skill boost for Rudy Gobert clearly. If rudy had a better offensive repertoire he could probably be prime Dwight level IMO.   Athleticism is kinda tough, I wanna say Joe ingles because he's so slow. He's super versatile and intelligent, if he was a little more explosive he'd be able to create his own shot better and be a bigger threat to defenses. But I think maybe the better answer is Bogdanovic. He is already a good pure scorer who can get super hot, he's not a bad athlete but bring him up one more notch and he'd be lethal."
"He's a reddit star along with Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, basically any one who suburbia relates to"

"You obviously just want to ignore my comment now. But where in the world are you getting that Steph is the first player in history to lead the league in scoring and efficiency?  This year he’s 19th in TS% among qualified players. Of the guys ahead of him, Joe Ingles, Gobert, Allen, Holmes, Bridges and Harris are all respectably high volume. And both Porter Jr and Durant are very high volume scorers. How is Steph under any reasonable qualifications leading the league in efficiency? And both Zion and Jokic are less than 1% behind Steph.  And Steph is in no way the first person to do this. It’s also not even certain he will end the year as 1st and 19th. But anyway, Durant led the league in scoring in 2013-14 and was 7th in TS%. And 2011-12 he led the league in scoring and was 13th in TS%. Shaq in 99-00 led the league in scoring and was 12th in TS%. Michael Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times and finished as high as 6th in TS%, with several other finishes in the top 15.  Steph’s volume and efficiency is absolutely incredible, but I don’t know where you’re getting these apparently fake stats from."
"Joe Ingles. Already knocked the clippers out once with him, would be hilarious to do so again this year."
"Fuck that man I want everyone talking trash. I want Ricky Rubio talking shit to Chris Paul. I want Jae Crowder threatening to home invade a Lopez brother.

"Joe Ingles is like the trashy version of Luka, which is awesome."
Or Joe Ingles
"In his last 18 games Dorian ""Joe Ingles"" Finney-Smith has a 68 TS%."
"I don't think this is true. Otherwise we'd see Joe Ingles and CP3 hoovering up rebounds for the NBA's top two teams. I think it's just a stylistic preference - Russ likes to have the ball in his hands so he'll take any uncontested rebound available.  Simmons is one of the league's best playmakers and he still prefers to leak ahead in transition if the opportunity presents itself.  The game doesn't really evolve unless teams can demonstrate that their approach works deep in the playoffs. The most notable stylistic changes in the last five years have been more small ball (thanks Heatles), three point shooting (thanks Curry), more heliocentrism (thanks Harden) and more zone defense (thanks Nick Nurse)."
"That's a pretty silly take considering ""MVP/all timer and one of the GOAT pgs"" is just a description of Joe Ingles."
Joe Ingles isn't our most famous player?
"He is the number 1 hottest three point shooter currently. But that does not mean he is the best three point shooter in the league, the same way Joe Harris wasn’t the best shooter when he was shooting 50% for half the year or Ingles wasn’t the best shooter when he was shooting like 60% for a month or something.  You should do some research on the term recency bias"
“joe ingles and crew”  lol the team doesnt have as much star power as they did with stockton and malone but you acting like joe ingles is our most famous player is absurd
"Nah those Jazz teams had an MVP/all timer and one of the GOAT pgs.  Joe Ingles and crew, while impressively good, do not come close to the starpower"
"I don’t know if those are good comparisons. LaMelo shot an equally shit percentage, but on double the volume, with more difficult pull-up type shots. Also if you watch some of his games, a lot of assists aren’t always super impressive. I’m intrigued though. If we could get LaMelo lite mid lottery, that’d be great, but I worry he’ll turn out to be a Joe Ingles who can’t shoot."
Joe Ingles.
joe ingles and mike conleys toddlers play on the same soccer team and theres hella drama about playing time
"1. conley, SS - good defender, will get on base, has never struck out in his entire career. great table setter  2. mitchell, CF - good speed and range, can hit for power as well  3. gobert, C - Big man with a huge bat, insane range defensively  4. bojan bogdanovic, DH - swings for the fences every time  5. joe ingles, LF - if bojan didnt bat them in joey vegemite will  6. jordan clarkson, RF - also swings for the fences every time  7. Georges Niang, 1B - hes in the league for his hitting, but also surprisingly decent defender for his position   8. royce oneale, 2B - good individual defender, not a huge offensive threat but he can make plays  9. derrick favors, 3b - quietly does the dirty work like a professional"
"Ah yes, the Kobe argument. (FWIW - obviously Kobe's efficient, but this was an argument cavemen typically used to decry Bron's advantage in TS).   Your question means you completely miss the point about TS, btw. Ingles is a high level role player who can somewhat create, so obviously his shots are almost always high percentage. CJ and LeVert are creators and have much higher usage, and have completely different roles to Joe - what you should be asking is who would you rather give the ball to, CJ or Steph? Then it becomes super clear that you want Steph all day because despite similar (or hell, even higher) creation load, his TS is still sky high."
He’s Joe ingles but less cool

TS is overrated when a player takes less than 15 FGA. Guys like Joe Harris and Ingles are overrrated. Let them shoot 15+ times and they will drop from 70% to 60% and less. Its stupid to compare Joe Ingles TS with 8 FGA and Steph Curry TS with 22 FGA

"Rudy Gobert only averages 2.77 blocks per game which really underrates the defensive impact he has when it comes to effecting shots.      Joe Ingles only averages 4.6 assists per game, despite being one of the best pick and roll ball handlers in the league and playmakers in general. I think in 2018-19 he led all non point guards in assists while starting every game as a small forward."
"What?      KD, James, Kyrie vs Rudy, Mitchell, Conley and Joe Ingles  Nets in 4 or 5"
"Here's some remarks on probably the most unremarkable game of the NBA season (or NBA history, you decide). But hey, I wrote all this shit down so I figured I'd share:  * Early on when Rudy is in the action on D he's comfortable straying away from Poeltl to contest shots. First possession he alters an elbow jumper from Vassell then next possession he leaves Jake Puddle to contest Keldon Johnson's layup. This Spurs bunch doesn't have great passing so they're not looking for JP on lobs or quick interior passes to punish Gobert * CAVEAT TO THE ABOVE POINT: two straight possessions the Jazz guard the Murray/JP PnR with two guys; Gobert stunts to Murray both times and Murray finds JP for two buckets * Trent Forrest Good: puts Vassell in jail on the PnR and hits a nice floater. Trent Forrest Bad: leaves his feet contesting a pretty weak Murray pump fake (on replay Murray may have even been looking to pass?) and fouls the shit out of him. Trent Forrest Good: slips by Murray in screen-the-screener action that Quin loves and gets a wide open dunk (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""That's a big time NBA move."" Uhh, no Craig, the Spurs fucked up the coverage and were all yelling at each other after the play) * Wooofff Rudy Gay just got flat-footed by Bojan on an iso and beat to the rim. Bojan isn't De'Aaron Fox, folks. Maybe it's legs because the Spurs have had a hellacious schedule but that looked pretty bad * Spurs get a couple buckets in the first with Lonnie Walker going at Clarkson. The Jazz need JC in the playoffs but he's going to get attacked, he's dying on every screen (even small/small screens). At least JC is hitting the floater though, 5/6 early for 12 1st quarter points * Dieng is getting cooked in PnR. Like Jordan Clarkson [cooking a grilled cheese cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nreFpbJXt30). He gives up a wide open lane to Ingles off a Gobert screen then on a Forrest/Gobert PnR he doubles Forrest (???) and it's an easy lob to Gobert. He's -14 in 6 minutes. Jazz up 22. Cue Drew Eubanks * Oni kinda looks like a guy who can be a good on-ball defender but he's not particularly quick or long or strong or cerebral. Granted he's usually guarding some of the bigger threats. And on offense he'll hit the open corner three and get some offensive rebounds but that's basically it. If he doesn't add something to his game this summer I don't see him sticking. He's like Royce but slightly worse at everything * Pop may be throwing in the towel a bit early tonight? Poeltl hasn't been in since his first stint, logging just seven first half minutes. After going down 22 they're running with Walker/Eubanks/Tre Jones/Bates-Diop/Samanic to close the 2nd quarter. That is, uhh, not an inspiring group. But I don't blame him, the Spurs have been ahead of the game with resting players and I'm sure Pop is trying to save his guys for winnable games and the play-in * Let's talk about Joe Ingles. He's running the point when he's out there w/ Conley/Mitchell out. Everyone says he's ""crafty"" which is kinda just a bullshit lazy white-guy characterization. To me crafty means you have multiple moves, countermoves, variations on those countermoves. LaMelo Ball is crafty, Ja Morant is crafty, Luka Doncic is crafty. Joe has exactly two moves in the PnR: (1) drive left, pass fake and shoot (2) drive left and dump off pass to Gobert/Favors. He's just **really** good at those two moves. Which is hilarious because, as someone who watches the Jazz all the time, you see it coming from a mile away. But Joe times that pass or pass fake so perfectly that it works more often than not * Jazz up 24 at the half. Bojan leading the way with 19 points on 8/9 from the field and getting to the rim at ease against this not-your-father's-Spurs Defense * Addendum to Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: (3) a third defender comes over in the PnR to tag Gobert and Joe whips a lefty pass to the corner for a Bojan three * Watching Royce O'Neale is kinda hilarious because he makes like four buckets a game but he celebrates each one like a cocky eighth grader. He finishes on Poeltl with an admittedly nice lefty scoop shot and looks at his hand as he runs back, then makes a WIDE open three and points to the corner camera while backpedaling. But hey, if you play a thankless role guarding the best guys and being the fifth option on Offensive like O'Neale, go ahead and celebrate big guy * Self-Aggrandizing-Victory-Lap on Joe's aforementioned PnR moves: Joe does move (1) and gets an and-1 on Poeltl (Craig Bolerjack RE this play: ""CRAFTY!"") * All of the sudden the Jazz are up 36 midway through the third quarter and this game is over. Friendly reminder that there are too many games in the NBA season and to get your COVID Vaccine. Yours truly will now be tuning out and YouTubing Jordan Clarkson cooking grilled cheese"
I never thought I'd see Dekobe Debryant get absolutely bodied by Joe fucking Ingles.
I remember watching the olympics and saying I thought joe ingles could make it in the nba. My mate (who was a crazy melo fan) gave me a rundown on how much he would get destroyed by nba Small forwards. That jazz v OKC series will forever be validation to me.
Curry is the American Joe Ingles
"His volume isn't high though, I think even Joe Harris shoots more than he does but Ingles is the superior playmaker and ft shooter.  His numbers with Mitchell and Conley injured would drop that quite a bit.  I'm still personally confused at how Harris is so average at the ft line with that stroke."
"People talk about Dejounte Murray like he's amazing on defense and while he does play amazing defense occasionally, for the most part he's average to slightly above average. Just the last game he played, he was constantly letting Joe Ingles blow by him. Guys like Marcus Smart, Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday are far better defenders than him."
"Well, the short answer is Euroleague games are shorter, more defense- and team oriented. It is almost a different game. A lot of people do the mistake of comparing European stats with NBA stats but they are simply not comperable.  In Vildoza's case, I personally wouldn't call him a star player but he is promising. I don't know how he translates to NBA but I can see him producing in a faster game with more space.   We'll see though. Since they are different type of games every player reacts differently. For example people also always thinks every European player that comes to NBA was a star in Euroleague but that is also not true. We can take Joe Ingles as an example. He was simply a bench wing for years and he wasn't even that good, nobody would ever count him among the best players but he found his niche in NBA. Another example can be Spanoulis, who was among the best players in Europe for years. Nobody in Europe would ever tell you that Ingles is better Spanoulis, yet Spanoulis only played one year in NBA and had to return. The game wasn't really suited for him. It was and is always a matter of fit.   One last example for scoring comparison can be Giannis. He averaged 14 points in FIBA World Cup in 2019. Since he can't shoot and there are different rules (smaller court, no defensive three seconds, no extra steps NBA refs allow), he wasn't as effective as he is in NBA. I repeat once again it's a matter of fit."
"Teodosic was MVP a decade ago. Joe Ingles was unplayable and couldn't score in Europe , now he has the best shooting season ever. It goes both ways my dude, but you don't chose to look both ways"
"just put the ball in the hoop, how difficult is it?  - Joe Ingles, probably"
JOE INGLES
I am joe ingles
I was going to say Joe Ingles but then I remembered every play of Joe Ingles is the best play.
you’re really into joe ingles huh
"Joe ""Charles Barkley"" Ingles"
"Currently, 6th man of the year favorite (-1250 today on Draft Kings)  is other Utah Jazz stud, Jordan Clarkson.  Clarkson is a huge part of the reason that the Jazz have held the league's top record for virtually the entire season, as he provides them with a major scoring spark off of the bench. With a career-high average of 17.5 points per performance, Clarkson is Utah's second-leading scorer, despite the fact that he only plays 26 minutes per game. Only Donovan Mitchell (26.4 points per game) scores more than Clarkson for Utah.   That said. The NEXT odds favorite (+500) is Joe Ingles"
"It’s unnecessarily complex for the situation. If league average TS fluctuates from 10-50%, then your TS+ formula would be significantly better. But with how little league average changes, it’s a true but unimportant distinction. It literally only serves the purpose of helping redditors who argue about whether joe ingles is the most efficient wing of all time.  This is a case of misapplied statistical analysis."
All the time - Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles.
"Yes. Same. Why are you the way that you are, Joe Ingles?"
I want the Joe Ingles AMA!! It'd be the funniest one.
The perfect player for an AMA is Joe Ingles. He'll answer the stupidest questions out there guaranteed!
"As I just said to you in the other comment moron, the only person that said best defender in nba was joe Ingles. No one else in the video says it. You cant even check your own fucking source that's a 2minute video lol"
"Lmao yup and you all post the same fucking youtube link too. Maybe actually watch the video you post? Kd says in the very beginning ""best defender at the guard position."" The only person in the vid who called him the literal best defender is joe Ingles. The rest are just giving lots of praise and deservedly so, but not calling him the literal best.      And buddy I could genuinely care less over who reddit thinks is better defensively between jrue and ben they're both great. But you and you're fanbase are just unbearable"
Those sketches don't even show the tattoo of Joe Ingles that every player has. Complete trash!
Joe Ingles.

Joe Ingles
"Kawhi Leonard is dealing with an ACL injury, but how bad is it?   Sources have revealed to AllClippers that Kawhi Leonard is dealing with an ACL sprain and that he will likely miss the rest of the series against the Utah Jazz.  Leonard's last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster, to say the least. After defeating the Utah Jazz in Game 4 on Monday, Leonard told reporters that he was ""all good"" in regards to sitting out the final minutes of Game 4 because of a knee collision after Joe Ingles fouled him. AllClippers reached out to sources who confirmed that Leonard also told teammates that he was ""all good."" His statement to the media wasn't just a front, Kawhi actually believed that he was all good."
JINGLED! haha paul george you are joe ingles son hyuk hyuk
I better not see any more Joe Ingles father comments anymore
One dimensional offenses get exposed in the playoffs. Without Conley and a healthy Donovan the jazz are completely one dimensional. Joe Ingles can fill in certain spots here or there but he's gassed from the last month of carrying the load. Really relied on Bojan or Clarkson to be more than they can realistically expect to are. Hopefully Mike comes back next game otherwise this series is over.   Kinda funny this is almost the exact opposite the rockets series a couple years ago. Tons of shooters and no one to break down the defense and get them the ball in open spots
NO MORE JOE INGLES IS PAUL GEORGE'S DAD MEMES
"While everything you said is true, Conley is your only reliable true playmaker. Mitchell isn't quite at that level and Joe Ingles is a secondary facilitator at best. It leads to a lot of turnovers and when the threes aren't falling you need Conley to help create shots at the rim. It really is a bigger loss than most people give it credit for. And having Mitchell hurt doesn't help obviously. But all that said, Jazz really should have found a way to win this game"
Loved how Eagle said it’s the Spider-Man meme when Luke Kennard guarded Joe Ingles
Same I can't fucking stand Joe Ingles and this sub's obsession with him
"I don't like Utah, but Joe Ingles definitely isn't why lmfao. Jingles is one of my favorite players in the league."
How could you dislike Joe ingles
Joe Ingles? He's one of my favourite players. Why would people hate him? What's to hate? :/  I quite like Utah as a team. Only thing I don't like is the fanbase.
*Joe ingles IG fan account is typing…*
Joe the GOAT Ingles at it again.
Joe Ingles gonna have a legendary finish to this game
Joe Ingles  Cause of death: drowned in a sea of pussy
Joe Ingles reminds me of an old version with less hair of the blonde guy from the One Direction band
"Since teams can have a 0 and a 00 on their roster at the same time (like Dame and Carmelo), could players start putting a 0 before a single digit too? Like Joe Ingles could be 2 and some other guy could be 02"
"Did I hear that right? Announcer just said ""Luke Kennard against Joe Ingles in a Spiderman meme"" ???"
Joe Ingles is a corpse on defense holy shit
Sit Don play Joe Ingles… can’t believe I said that. But Don is a shadow of himself with that ankle.
Joe Ingles
Why isn't Joe Ingles out playing Paul George? I thought he was better than him
"Joe Ingles could do an ""Uncle Drew"" spin-off and he wouldn't even have to wear a disguise"
Joe Ingles?  Yes. Seth curry? yes. Both bogdanovich. Yes and yes.  Capela?  probably. Marcus Morris. Probably.  Reggie Jackson? Maybe???  Is he even top 25 of every guy left in the playoffs?  LMAO
Joe Ingles looks that 42 year old in your local gym that doesn't look like much but can ball out.
That signature Joe Ingles bump
when you study for Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles but get Royce O'Neal on the exam
Fuck joe ingles. Pos dirty fuck  That was clearly a dirty foul
"Kawhi and Kyrie suffered in-game injuries. So did Lebron, who wasn't load-managing (i.e. not worried about over-use) prior to his injury. Harden has a bad hamstring - he came into training camp in poor shape, part of trying to force a trade. Is anyone really surprised that this is lingering on for him?  You call me dense, but what exactly is your argument here?  NBA basketball comes with the risk of leg injuries. Kyrie came down on Giannis' foot and rolled his ankle. The same thing that happened to Donovan Mitchell. The same thing that happened to Ja Morant in the 2nd game of the season.  Kawhi bumped knees with Joe Ingles. Joel Embiid landed awkwardly.   These are natural basketball injuries. You cannot blame the schedule for them.  Yes, Jamal Murray hurt his ACL on a non-contact play, and AD seemed to have an over-use injury. They are two of the more injury-prone players in the league. I don't really think you should point to those two and say ""SEE, WE KNEW IT!"""
Seems like NBA Finals MVP will be between Joe Ingles or Tobias Harris.
he played back to backs this season. It made me so nervous   then he played 40+ min in every game vs the Mavs (hard minutes) but he looked ok so I thought maybe it’s ok   fuck Joe Ingles. Hip checking someone while they’re running is dangerous. And fuck this schedule and every other day game thing
1. Matt Bonner 2. Joe Ingles 3. Lance Stephenson 4. Quinndary Weatherspoon
"Joe Ingles, everyone thinks he's just a good shooter, but he's one of the better players at running the pick and roll on our team.  He just gets meme-d because he looks like a janitor"
"Nah man. Joe was a winner. yes you can argue that Ingles had a better team, but George had plenty of talent around him and he frequently didn’t perform big in clutch moments.  Joe Ingles is a better player all time than Paul George"
At this rate Finals MVP is gonna be somebody like Ingles/Bridges/Joe Harris/Shake Milton because those will be the most talented players left.
It's time for us to put all the pressure and the Joe Ingles Jazz lead team. No excuses Jazz or prepare for the major dump on your face by the media the following day.
Joe Ingles vs Jeff Green as the marque matchup of the night between two backup versatile forwards suddenly thrusted into the limelight due to an unfortunate string of circumstances.  We’ll be back with more coverage of the NBA finals on tape delay stay tuned to ESPN 8: the Ocho.  Where if it’s almost basketball then it’s kinda a sport.
"With respect to the Niang question, during the regular season he was an elite three point shooter (especially on above the break threes) and a solid team defender. We were actually kind of worried that we wouldn't be able to afford him this offseason. The problem with Niang though is that he plays at a very slow pace a la Kyle Anderson/Joe Ingles, but when the game speeds up come playoff time, Niang simply isn't as skilled as those guys to respond to the increased speed."
Fuck Joe ingles
That pizza guy turns out to be Joe ingles.
"i hate joe ingles with a passion but this wasn’t dirty, just unlucky."
Such a dirty reckless play by Joe Ingles. Disgusting behaviour! /s In all seriousness I knew happiness was too good to be true :/ get better soon Kawhi
Bro we’re really gonna get the Nets big 3 vs Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles in the Finals smh
Fuck you Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles.
joe ingles
Joe Ingles is the superior Joe
"Don’t talk about Shaq like that, but I agree with Kenny smith. Get joe ingles or marjonvich, then we’re talking"
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade … this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
"Joe Ingles first step is legitimately quite good, at least from the eye test"
&gt; Khris is the ultimate guy to watch for anybody who isn’t super athletic  This is understating it. Middleton might literally be the least athletic starting wing in the league. It's a massive credit to him that he's so good with less speed and explosiveness than Joe Ingles
"I think Ty has done a great job at identifying a working formula, but I don't have an issue with Snyder's coaching. Sometimes, the other team just has Kawhi and PG and a good supporting cast and you have to tip your cap to them.     I think Snyder is in a bind and he knows that with athletes of the caliber of Joe Ingles and Georges Niang there are only so many ways you can play against the Clippers' wings. It's frustrating, as a Jazz fan, but hopefully we get Mike back and kind of discombobulate them a bit with the home crowd."
It’s at least half of joe ingles. And 1/3 of bogdonavic.
most nba players don’t fit the typical utah demographic besides ironically someone like joe ingles
"I just want to point out how much I love that Pat “just runs around” Bev immediately plays hard defense after the poster. And how, while not shown in the highlight posted, Joe Ingles (sorry don’t have a good nickname for him) isn’t phased and drains a 3 on the other side right away."
Yeah I'm sure when Joe Ingles tried to clip his knee and then shoved him afterwards that was totally on Kawhi     Wonder what the reaction would be if Pat Bev tried that with Donovan Mitchell?
"From an Aussie, fuck you Joe Ingles!"
Cause this sub actually like Joe Ingles and not PauL George for very valid reasons...?
Joe Ingles is a very underrated player. He's the devil when he's got a hot hand.
"Joe Ingles with the English... and funnily enough, he’s a British citizen."
The English from Joe Ingles!! Lmao
I think the Jazz would still be solid without their best player Joe Ingles
Playoff p is getting past him with ease every time. It’s like playoff p has finally realized that Joe Ingles can’t guard him when he’s confident and aggressive.
Joe Ingles needs to just come to peace with the fact that he’s bald and commit to it
"Joe Ingles simply chose not to win tonight, otherwise his brainpower alone could’ve kept the Clippers to 0 points if he really wanted to. He just never abuses his unstoppable power."
Caught Joe Ingles Air Ball. It flew all the way to my house. Can I keep it?
Joe Ingles looks like a very tired Dodo Bird
"lmao Kennard giveth, Kennard alloweth Joe Ingles to burn him to the rim"
Not sure why clarkson is getting more minutes than joe ingles in a game in which we’re clearly missing out on playmaking
Has anyone ever seen Joe Ingles and Michael Jordan in the same room at the same time?
A Joe Ingles mid range jumpshot would get more up votes on this sub than a PG poster dunk
As a Joe Ingles hater these performances please me
Joe Ingles jumper has a little Dirk feel to it
No pity necessary. They had their chance to sign the GOAT 3 point shooter in Joe Ingles and failed to do so.
The Jazz could have went 16-0 while only playing Joe Ingles this playoffs and people would still say they weren't legit.
"Of course, I mean it’s CLASSY Joe Ingles   /s"
"Nah i think they have a point. There's more to it than race, but I remember watching a video called like ""Joe Ingles being a troll!!!😂😂"" of him talking shit and irritating opponents and whatnot and then a video called like ""Pat Beverly being a clown"" of him doing the exact same shit"
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
"I don’t wanna get in any sort of crossfire here, and maybe it’s foolish of me to ask, but what is the general sentiment that makes people dislike the Laker fans? Is it that some feel “superior” for liking the team? Is it spamming wild trade ideas?  I don’t think those things are right to do. I know the internet maybe acts as a shield for some to say whatever they want, but I feel there are ways to be a passionate and polite sports fan. It’s fine to maybe be mad at a loss or excited for a win, but nobody should make personal attacks or bombard others with harassment.  Maybe it’s just the way things go (Lakers play the baddies against underdogs, Kings get made fun of, everyone respects Joe Ingles), but I guess I’d wanna see a basketball world where there can be a healthy balance of enthusiasm and common decency."
It’s one of his nicknames. Joe + Ingles = Jingles
I need Joe Ingles to take this man's ankles next game 💀
"Ya'll absolutely don't get to claim Ingles, his entire origin story is that you guys chose to NOT sign him.  If Ingles is a former Clipper then so is everyone Doc Rivers has ever spoken to.  This is like Joe Cool claiming Batman as a gangster who grew up robbing rich couples in Crime Alley."
"&gt;What is your relationship with X Player    I don't know what the media expects..  Is he supposed to say *""Oh.. Joe Ingles? Yes. He usually owns me in the Playoffs and i got jingled a lot. Haha. He's awesome""*  &gt;  It makes no sense. Not even a proper bait question. Everyone would just ignore it  &gt;  Especially Paul George. He'll never give credit to anyone.  Dude's a delusional headass    He's the same idiot who said ""we are in the driving seat"" after every game they lost against the Nuggets last season.. up until Game 7. He was probably saying the same thing to himself even after Game 7"
"&gt;I think this was a proper response from Paul. Especially with how big a shot he hit over him late in the game. The only Paul George stopper is Paul George.   How? That's fuckin ignorant. Big shot? They barely survived Dallas, where Luka Doncic was the best player on the floor.. and now they are trying to survive Utah  &gt;  JOE INGLES literally asked the media to NOT talk about Paul and him, because it's in the past. Ingles had every right to STUNT on Paul George and shit on him. Him and the Utah Jazz fucked Paul George in the Playoffs. But Ingles acted with MATURITY. That's the difference     &gt;   Paul George on the other hand, still acts like an ignorant and delusional shit head.     What was he saying when they had a giant lead last year against the Nuggets?  ""wE aRe in ThE dRivIng SeAt""   &gt;  What was he saying when he signed a fat contract with OKC??   ""uNfIniShed BusineSs""   &gt;  Dude's a literal headass"
Mans FINALLY outplayed Joe Ingles in a game. That's a rare scenario.. in the Playoffs
"He just doesn't play well in Utah, he has PTSD of Joe Ingles putting the absolute clamps on him and out performing him in every possible way ever since that OKC matchup.  He isn't one of the types of players to be able to block that stuff out. 20,000 people chanting about him being overrated seems to truly actually rattle him. He freezes up and stops looking like himself. You could build a house with all the bricks he put up in games 1 and 2 lol"
"""Paul George was quoted saying Joe Ingles is a 'talented player and a true competitor', does this prove that Joe has found his way inside Paul's head? Tune into ESPN after the post game show for more analysis of this confusing compliment"""
"Until I see him do it in front of the Utah crowd he's still Joe Ingles' son as far as I'm concerned  Edit: I love PG by the way, I own his Hickory Pacers jersey- but he's traditionally the actual son of Joe Ingles in the playoffs"
"Seriously. The guy was a cold playoff killer in Indiana but he’s had a lot of terrible playoff series since. All mental.  Didn’t he have a 5 point dud vs. Joe Ingles in a game 7 loss just a couple years ago? Seems like Ingles does a decent job of “stopping” him.  Also, theres no such thing as a true “stopper” with modern nba foul calls. The clippers had two supposed perimeter D beasts in Kwahi and Playoff P and they couldn’t stop Murray, Doncic, etc."
I don't give a fuck about Joe Ingles either. PG doin gods work.
PG: “i don’t give a shit”  /r/nba: “TRANSLATION: FUCK JOE INGLES”
"Joe Ingles - ""And I took that personally."""
"Wonder why this only has 195 upvotes   Replace Jokic’s name with Paul George, and Ayton with Joe Ingles and this post has 5k upvotes and a thousand awards lmao"
That's too bad. Joe Ingles is the best. Great dude.
Joe Ingles is a huge trash talker.
at some point Ingles was talkin to PG in the free throw line and Paul was ignoring him but Joe nudged him to pay attention lol.
"Correct. [During the Jazz’s media availability on Thursday prior to Game 2 of their Conference Semifinal series with the LA Clippers, the Utah forward said he doesn’t think much of his supposed rivalry with Clippers star Paul George.  ](https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/joe-ingles-says-beef-with-paul-george-is-a-bit-old-in-my-mind)"
Joe Ingles said as much last time they asked him about PG.
Lob City cut a young Joe Ingles. He would have been a perfect fit for them.
They said joe ingles playing like a soccer momm
"Your Joe Ingles slander will not be tolerated, sir."
"Was pretty good in his first stint in Orlando, like not an All-Star, but a Joe Ingles level of good (but as a scorer/shooter instead of a playmaker/defender/shooter). Was okay in Denver, but from memory that team was a mess with chemistry and coaching changes. I think that was the Ty Lawson DUI season??  AA was kind of a rhythm player though who needed the ball run through him, so wasn't as great in Portland where he was forced to play as more of a spot up guy, same with Knicks where they were in their experimental triangle offense era, and the Kings who had too many guys ahead of him.  I don't think he was *washed* by the time he came back to Orlando, but he was basically a cheerleader for that squad. He could play in the right role, but no team wants/needs a 32 year old 15ppg guy who needs the ball in his hands to be effective."
A team full of Joe Ingles
You cannot trade Joe fucking Ingles. Absolutely get fucked. Give that man some respect.
Kawhi was playing like the best player in the league before Joe Ingles decided to pull a Zaza and he’s not even in your top 5?!   Someone’s clearly bitter that he left and as a result their team won’t even sniff another championship ever again
"Cant forget class acts joe ingles,kelly onlynk and davis bertans"
"Hamish blake is a national icon, gotta say Joe Ingles is the hamish blake look-alike"
Joe Ingles pulled a Zaza on Kahwi
"Well allow me to be wrong. And in the spirit of being wrong I’ve decided to be thoroughly and intricately wrong. Let’s begin.   We start with Kareem and Giannis. We all know Kareem is the career scoring champion but not for long. Lebron will soon dethrone him. And who dethroned Lebron? Why, Giannis of course. By this logic alone Giannis is better but if we get down to the details statistically Giannis is a better player. He provides similar defense and scoring with the added passing and fast break scoring dimension to his game. Also Giannis doesn’t play against plumbers (except Joe Ingles).   Next we have Worthy and Middleton. Middleton won’t have a better career than Worthy I’ll give you that. But right now he’s at his peak and his peak sent a full strength KD and choke job Harden home sans Giannis. One could say KD is a poor mans Khris Middleton. One could say any shot KD can hit Middleton *will* hit. And one will say (that one being me) he’s the best player in the playoffs. No exceptions. Khris ‘bug-eye/deadeye’ Middleton is better than Giannis and thus is better than Kareem who was better than Worthy.   Any questions? I didn’t think so.   Finally we have my most controversial (wrong) take. Magic bricked so many jump shots you’d think the guy had AIDS. He’s an all time great point god sure. But you know who else is an all time great point god? CP3.  Now I love CP3 but I hope State Farm has an ass insurance policy because Holiday has proceeded to rip CP3s ass off just so he can hand it to him. But that doesn’t mean Jrue is better than Magic it means he’s better than CP3. And in all honesty he’s not. But the edge I give to Magic is erased by Magic’s tenure as a GM. You can’t be that bad at building a basketball team and continue to call yourself a basketball player.  In conclusion (aka **tl;dr**) Kareem can’t pass like Giannis, Middleton is the 2nd best iso scorer in NBA history and Magic Johnson GMd his way out of even qualifying as a basketball player."
"His personality alone is golden.  His game is beautiful as well.  If there was a debate about which is more important, Basketball IQ vs Athleticism, Joe Ingles is the guy you go to to point out how important Basketball IQ is.  When he's playing his best, the dude just always makes the right plays, and picks apart defenses so casually, it's wild to watch."
Joe Ingles   I don’t understand why he’s as liked as he is
"See this is what I hate about Lamelo fans. No he didn’t drag his team to the playoffs. I watched about half of all the hornets games this season and he’s not even the second best player on his team, he’s the third. Rozier and Hayward are both better than him. In fact when Lamelo got injured the team went on a 5-2 run before Hayward got injured and that was their best run of their season.  Lamelo this year without Hayward is 4-10. Hornets legit have a better record when he is not on the floor than when he plays. He didn’t drag nothing.   Now saying he’s better than SGA is a horrible take. SGA is legit one of the most efficient scores in the league along with Curry, kyrie, and lavine. He averaged 50.8% from the field, 41.8% from three, and 80.8% from the line. He missed 50/40/90 club bc of free throws but what he did is still crazy. And it’s not like he’s doing it on small volume either, he averages 23.7 ppg on that efficiency and it’s so much more impressive when you look at the situation he’s in. It’s much easier for someone like joe Harris or ingles to do it bc the defensive focus is not on them, it’s either on KD, Mitchell, etc. The fact that SGA is basically surrounded by scrubs (I love Dort but he still needs work on the offensive end) makes it so much more impressive bc he is the one who gets all of the defensive coverage. Lamelo is nice but he’s nowhere near as good of a scorer as SGA. He averages 15.7 ppg on 43.6% from the field, 35.2% from three, and 75.8% from the line all while being the third option for defensive coverage. SGA also beats him out in pretty much every advanced stat. If we’re talking about who is carrying their team it’s no contest. Thunder are 16-19 with SGA which is a borderline play in team (having a better record than both bulls and pelicans which would make them the 11th seed in both conferences) and nearly as good as the hornets record this year (45.7% to 45.8%). Thunder without SGA tho are 6-31, a 16.2% W%. That is by far the worst team record in the league and is the 12th worst record in NBA history. Hornets are 10-11 without lamelo (5-2 with just Lamelo out and not Hayward) a 47.6% W% and hornets are 23-28 with lamelo a 45.1% W%. Now you tell me who is really carrying their team: a guy who makes their team a borderline play in team when he plays while they’re a historically bad team when he doesn’t or the guy whose team has a worse record when he plays than when he doesn’t. It’s funny how you say Lamelo isn’t better than Fox but SGA is debatable when SGA is legit better than Fox"
"Bruh, that's alright. Save yourself from the embarrassment of losing to the powerhouse that is Australia. They got Joe Ingles. Mf built like Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, Magic and Luka into one.   Kidding aside, it's really surprising how the team has absolutely no good playmakers. Let's see how far the team gets."
"I see a lot of people choosing Team B, but I think it's easily Team A. You are surrounding Draymond Green with 4 shooters and surrounding Jokic with 3 shooters. You are also covering Jokic's only weakness with Draymond Green, one of the top 3 defenders in the league. Also, when the worst passer in your starting 5, is Joe Ingles, your team is solid.   Team B is incredible defensively but when the 2nd best 3 point shooter in their starting 5 is Myles Turner, the team is going to struggle offensively. Also despite their defense, they have no one to stop Jokic"
"I watched all three games and it wasn't that bad.  A few players tried if a few times and moved on.  Hell, even the foreign NBA players (Joe Ingles) tried it too.  Your threshold of embarrassment is low lol"
"That’s only because Joe Ingles is too nice, though"
"But even I can understand Joe Ingles.  Well, sorta, anyway..."
"Some things to know:  - Joe Ingles is the GOAT  Thats it, that's all you need to know"
"2008 Olympics, some notable names:  Spain: Pau, Marc, Rubio, Calderon, Rudy Fernandez, Juan Carlos Navarro  Argentina: Carlos Delfino, Manu, Andres Nocioni, Pablo Prigioni, Luis Scola  China: Yao, Yi Jianlian  Germany: Dirk  Australia: Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Andrew Bogut  ----------  I feel like the idea of these teams being better now is just something that people keep repeating to the point that they accept it as fact. I think Spain and Argentina from '08 easily beat all these teams.  The Redeem team had a legit hard-fought game against Spain in the Gold Medal match."
I get this but it’s weird for me because I think lonzo’s best option would be becoming joe Ingles and lonzo isn’t similar to bird at all
LeBron returning just to get torched by Patty Mills and Joe Ingles  You love to see it
You can thank Joe Ingles for that

pat connaughton is like joe ingles. he’s white and doesn’t take huge pride in his appearance so everyone thinks he’s trash just by looking at him
Joe Ingles as SG
"Wasn’t talking about you, was talking about NBA teams and not giving him the recognition and giving him a chance. Joe Ingles is half the player Gaze was and he is a solid contributor."
"John Collins has averaged 16.6ppg, 8.4rpg, 1bpg on 56/35/83% shooting over four seasons and he’s made $11mil for his efforts. Max him out… Joe Ingles is 33yrs old, has lesser stats and will make $14mil this season alone."
Yeah what? It's in the same breath as   &gt;Damn you Joe Ingles
FUCK JOE INGLES
Patiently waiting for everyone calling Pat Beverly a thug for yelling after a play to apply the same treatment to Joe Ingles for taking a top 5 player out for a season in an out of reach game. I wonder why people on this sub treat them differently?
"Joe Ingles doesn’t belong on the court. How could the nba continue to let him play? He’s not a player, he’s a THUG.  Edit: slug*"
lmao. just stalking the clippers sub. lmao some of your members blames Joe Ingles. lol
Joe ingles looks homeless!
No but Joe Ingles undercut and clipped his already vulnerable quad
Clippers sub really blaming joe ingles as if he did something intentionally or dirty
joe ingles is a menace to society
When Joe Ingles cheapshotted him
Fuck Joe Ingles and anyone who defends him
Joe Ingles is now clippers fan biggest enemy
So excited to call Joe ingles a crackhead who intentionally injures players for the next 5 years.
Fuck Joe ingles
damn you joe ingles
Joe Ingles is a thug
I guess it goes to show that time playing together helps a lot.  But still a team led by KD and Dame should not be losing to a team led by Patty Mills and Joe Ingles(I still love you Joe).
If this roster existed on an NBA team we could call them a super team and the title favorites.  Why would we not bash the title favorites for losing to a team of Patty Mills and Joe Ingles?
time to request one of those 2K sim dudes (mostly i just know clique and kenny) to do a 5 joe ingles vs 5 joe harris simulation
I simulate a Joe Ingles vs Joe Harris Finals every night in my dreams. It's the most glorious thing ever.
"Nobody except Joe Ingles deserves to be in the finals, if we're all being honest here"
"Team USA has fucking Kevin Durant and Dame Lillard and lost to Australia featuring Joe Ingles and Patty Mills  The talent differential has shrunk from where it was in 1992 but the rest of the world has not “caught up,” Team USA had no business losing these games (even though they’re going to be fine probably)"
"Lets see luka, giannis, joker, joe ingles, andrew wiggins. Wouldnt be too bad"
Joe Ingles claiming every child out there
"Even then the Australia team only has 6 NBA players (Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova and Josh Green)."
Josh Green (Mavericks)  Will Magnay (Pelicans)   Matisse Thybulle (76ers)   Patty Mills (Spurs)   Aron Baynes (Raptors)   Dante Exum (Rockets)   Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers)  Joe Ingles (Jazz)
"I get your point that it's not really accurate to suggest it's NBA talent vs a whole bunch of not NBA talent, but Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum, Matthew Dellavedova, Matisse Thybull, and Josh Green vs Damien Lillard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Jarami Grant, Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Zach LaVine, and Jayson Tatum isn't exactly close in individual talent."
Joe ingles did the exact same thing this game and didn’t get the call either lol
Joe ingles showing them levels
"Stephen A:  There is no reason [To lose to] some dude name Patty TheDestroyer, who goes by Patty Mills for the San Antonio Spurs. Or Joe Ingles. Or Thyb…however the hell you pronounce his name."
australian talent pool is smaller so guys like patty mills and joe ingles have played in multiple tournaments together  it's not about seeing each other lol. playing versus each other doesn't build chemistry at all
JOE INGLES WOW
Imagine losing to Joe Ingles and Dante Exum
I dont hope for injuries unless their name is Joe Ingles.
"Joe ingles showing these former, current and future Warriors chumps how to shoot the 3."

Sometimes I forget that Joe Ingles is good.
"...while he himself was injured, and had no backcourt help in one game and 50% of Mike Conley in the other.  But sure, let's pretend a Chris Paul that's rolling is the same thing as a hobbling Mike Conley and combination of Joe Ingles and Miye Oni."
2021 Suns MVP finalists:  - Solomon Hill 🔥🔥🔥  - Joe Ingles 🥶🥶🥶  - Andrew Wiggins 🥵🥵🥵  - Clint Capela 😈😈😈
Have been waiting for this!  I'm ready for bulk Joe Ingles shit talking content
"CJ McCollum rocking back and forth. Booker's ability to stop on a dime and go up for a jumper, picture perfect and under control. Bradley Beal somehow going from standing still to casually attacking the rim in a blink. Joe Ingles catch and shoot three while never bringing the ball down. These are a few of my favorite things."
"I mean, our starting backcourt was Mitchell with one working ankle and Joe Ingles."
Also their poor interior passing. Greg Anthony spent a whole quarter talking about how Joe Ingles kept fucking up the passes to Gobert.
"Joe Ingles &amp; Patty Mills, w Steve Adams as the enforcer"
"Guy bet on himself, and beat insane odds to make it in the nba. He has nor only done that but he’s a successful basketball player who got their by believing in himself.   I swear y’all are just too obsessed with hate. Joe ingles rammed his knee into kawhi’s and knocked him out of the playoffs, but y’all just keep bitching about pat bev."
"Good list. Derrick Rose, Joe Ingles,Boban, Tacko,"

He'd be a modern day Joe Ingles.
Joe Ingles and Lemon Pepper Lou
"I’m always surprised how good of a shooter Cam Payne is because his shooting form is awful. His feet point way off to the side instead of towards the basket. Same with Joe Ingles. If it works, it works though."
Joe Ingles must have his wall just fucking plastered with Scalabrine posters
"To be completely clear I'm not trying to diminish how good KD is, just pointing out that when we compare eras he's sort of one dimensional compared to Bird.  Jordan was an amazing scorer but Worthy preferred to guard him instead of someone who could not only shoot lights out but also move the ball and relocate.   To kind of simplify it, Bird was Curry before Curry, though obviously Curry has become the better shooter, AND Jokic/James AND the fight of Butler/Smart but in the body of Joe Ingles.  He was always at 100% intensity, worked hard off ball, could shoot, pass, and always looked to exploit any advantage he could.   KD is an elite scorer, much like Jordan was, but I don't see how it's any different unless you're arguing KD is better than Jordan?"
"Joe Ingles says he wants to retire to Australia, but he's a lot of fun when he's on the local sports radio in SLC."
"What is Garuba's upside?  PJ Tucker?  Even Keon - like, I guess some super version of Bruce Brown?  Like, I don't think Giddey is gonna be a star, but I could see him being a guy with Boris Diaw/Nic Batum/Joe Ingles type value as a big playmaker that can stuff the stat sheet."
Not mentioning Joe Ingles may look like a mistake in a few weeks time
"They didn't have to score in the paint.  Gobert is a fantastic paint defender and even adequate on the perimeter, but he's a liability against 5-out offenses.   In that scenario, he has to cover someone on the perimeter or the opponent just buries the Jazz in 3 pointers.  This creates 2 issues (one is the Jazz's fault, one is Gobert's).  1.  This leaves them without Gobert to backstop as rim protection and if the other mediocre Jazz defenders don't have that, they're much more likely to get blown by and give up a layup. 2. If you force Gobert into being an adequate perimeter defender (basically Joe Ingles) by playing 5-out, he can't do anything in the post to hurt you on the other side.  At that point, he's basically Joe Ingles...except without a shot, or dribble, or ability to create.  So he's a liability.  It's also important to note that issue 1 above is partly also the result of issue 2.  The Jazz have prioritized acquiring shooting (as opposed to defense), because they've been building around a non-shooter.  Guys like Ayton or Embiid also might have issues defensively against a small-ball lineup, but they're not going to get played off the court.  Because if you stick Nick Batum on them, they're going to do massive damage on the offensive end."
I’d say the same for the likes of Patty Mills and Joe Ingles with Australia. It’s so obvious when you hear them talk that the Boomers are so much more important to them than the NBA.
Either Rondo and D Rose for veterans that play hard  and have good iq  Or Malcolm Brogdon and Tyus Jones/Joe Ingles for extremely efficient do it all types
Joe Ingles + Derrick Favors + 2 future 1st round picks  Edit: I'm a Jazz fan until the Sonics win the pendant.
MPJ should be over AG and Conley should be over Joe Ingles
Joseph Ingles - they did Joe dirty
Joe Ingles should have won 6MOTY imo
"kemba walker, Joe ingles, Michael Carter Williams, Aaron Gordon, Kevin love"
"I was the same. Around the point the Suns went up 15, I was like, ""Now we wait for Pat Bev to do something reckless/dangerous around CP3/Book/Ayton to potentially injure them."" Still caught me off guard when it happened.  And it's tough too, you admire his tenacity (to an extent) as a small guard playing with something to prove. As an unbiased fan watching two great teams play, you enjoy watching him drive through the lane and flexing after he makes a tough layup, and riling up the crowed to cheer after a rough foul.   I was starting to warm up to Pat Bev during his series against the Jazz. He was stealing Donovan Mitchell's and Joe Ingles' lunch money non stop, there was nothing they could do about it. Even in the final game, Don went for a drive and slipped or something and was reeling in pain, and Pat ran up to him after the whistle blew and sort of appeared to be checking to see if he was OK, and patting him on the back after a hard fought game. Almost felt like he was turning a corner.  Then this series came and he busted Booker's noes, undercut CP3 and shoved him from behind in a closeout game. Any ""respect"" I had for him from the previous series quickly washed away around game 2/3 of this series."
Who has the title for Outback Jesus between him and Joe Ingles?
Joe Ingles broke us.
Kawhi has never load managed in the playoffs.  he didn’t even load manage last year outside of 5-6 games but dumb ass Joe Ingles decided to hip check him while he was running during a game that was already over   he should load manage next year during the reg season. I never thought it was a good idea for him to play back to backs
"he finished 18-19, he finished 19-20. He got hip checked by Joe Ingles this season and sprained his knee.."
This is all Joe Ingles fault! Ban him from the country.
If Joe ingles did it it’d go all time
It'd be like if Joe Ingles was the best player in the league
"Joe Ingles is the modern Larry Bird, not Luka."
Closest jumpshots I can find are from jokic and joe ingles
Yeah not like Bird played and won against the showtime Lakers and Bad Boy Pistons. Would Magic Johnson and Kareem also be Joe Ingles this generation?
You’re too young. I got to watch Bird live.   Magic was flashy but Bird would be just as disgusting in the modern era.   Bird would be Joe Ingles x 10000000 just talking shit and then burying a jumper in someone’s face.
durant and it is not close. Bird would be Joe Ingles in the modern NBA. KD would beat him 21-0 in a 1v1 game.
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
Joe Ingles
"Blake, meet your second option: The Nard Dog, sharpshooter for hire with the slickest pump fake in the game. Move over Korver. Move over Reddick. Move over even JOE INGLES. There’s a new white shooter in town and his name is Luke Douglas Kennard, 6’5 and 206 pounds. Watch him post up Deandre Jordan for the one handed slam and the stank face. Watch him date the daughter from Chrisley Knows Best. In 20 years Luke is going to be the second athlete to build a school like LBJ did in Akron. Nard University. Detroit will rebound on a dime as students pour in from across the world. Donovan Mitchell’s pitiful career will pale in comparison, and SVG’s true drafting prowess will be fully revealed."
So Joe Ingles would give ‘Nique the business? I don’t buy it
So Joe Ingles
Let the jazz throw in Joe Ingles and get Jaden McDaniels+ in return

"Sure, but are you *really* going to say that ankle was the main reason you lost the series when all of the following happened **post-Kawhi injury**?

Wow we got absolutely fleeced!!!! Y’all gotta realize Boston has zero use for 2nd round picks now. Like we already got two draft and stashes. Rather go get Joe Ingles than keep our seconds (just an example)

I would love to root for Joe Ingles.
I would love Joe Ingles on the Raptors.
"Issue with this i see is who do you poll?  Say you poll team USA, solely comprised of stars (and Keldon Johnson). Then you are only getting the perspective of stars and guys that *usually* get the calls.  Of course they aren't going to like FIBA officiating, they got less calls.    You could also poll guys like Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Evan Fournier since they are quite familiar with the FIBA officiating.  But then you have the opposite problem - you're polling guys that very likely benefit from the differing rule set. I don't see those three foul baiting often if at all and their opponents (the stars) suffered from the rules.   I would be surprised if they didn't like it more.    Then you have the fact that less than 80 percent of the NBA (rough guess) would not be included in this poll, and very likely would be unable because they have not experienced or played under a FIBA rule set.    So I dont see a good way to have an accurate poll."
"Dunno why you’re bringing up Joe Ingles now, but sure"
"Man if you think that’s bad, wait til you see  Joe Ingles"
Joe Ingles strikes me like that kind of a guy to be honest  Also I'm sure Paul George wouldn't say no to that after the injury he had
You actually think I'm serious saying Joe Ingles&gt; Steph Curry as a shooter?
nah  https://kslsports.com/400919/joe-ingles-im-the-best-shooter-in-the-league/?
"Dude is a stud in the regular season. Almost every opposing team’s game thread against us had a few comments like “WHO THE FUCK IS THIS NIANG GUY AND WHY CAN’T HE MISS???” He’s a great locker room guy too, Donovan and Conley were always making comments that he was the funniest player on the team (and that’s saying a lot on a team that has Joe Ingles).  Playoffs though? Dude was LAUGHABLY bad. Couldn’t hit a shot to save his life and single-handedly gave up multiple 10-0 runs to LA the second he was put in play."

Kawhi was shooting with Shaq-level efficiency from the *midrange* with elite defense before Joe Ingles took him out. People do not have memories or they're just not paying attention.

"His game has a polish that's better than the rest of Summer League, but I think it reasonable to wonder what he can work on to improve in the coming seasons. His bag is deep for sure. He's got nice post moves, decent handles, solid passing out of the short roll, and is willing to shoot 3's. However, his 3's aren't great (would have been 0-3 if not for that nice bounce) so perhaps that an area for improvement. His lack of lateral quickness may be fine for centers, but he's probably around 6'9"" so he's either an undersized skilled center or he's a big wing in the Joe Ingles mold (for defense). He's savvy enough to defend quicker guys and big enough to body big men, but he also lacks enough athleticism to avoid getting burned by skilled offensive players. Still, his positioning is great, his BBIQ is high, and he should do well as a backup (initially at least) at the next level."
"Going to start off with possibly the most unpopular basketball-related opinion in existence: Bill Laimbeer was hot in the 80s.    I like Joe Ingles but a lot of his autism awareness is advocating for organisations and programs that actively harm actually autistic people.  Donovan Mitchell and his fans being so salty over Simmons being in contention for Rookie of the Year because he was drafted in 2016 was just dumb - otherwise Larry Bird shouldn’t have won ROY over Magic.   Unless they play at an absolutely undeniably elite level, the Ball brothers’ legacy will be tainted by how embarrassing their dad is.  It’s like that one dad who insists his kids are better than everyone graduated from their kids being in the juniors to in the pros, and it’s just awkward to watch.  Until he actually proves himself outside of summer league, LiAngelo being on the Hornets will always look like nepotism.   Matisse Thybulle’s dad is much more fun to watch than Lavar Ball.  Ben Simmons also gets way too much credit for Matisse playing for Aus.   Kareem is the 🐐   🧙‍♂️&gt; 🦅"
"1. Kyrie Irving is the most offensively talented player in league history. His offense is so good people sleep on his defense. He is actually a great defender. 2. James Harden is supremely overrated his jumper is inconsistent af but i think he plays way better defense than he gets credit for 3. Draymond has been the best overall defender in the league for years but has regressed so much on offense he may as well be matisse thybulle  4. The Lakers roster is awesome i loved every move...shame they couldn't get Rudy gay tho 5. The bucks don't get passed the second round next year and the sun's getting bounced in the first 6. The Cavs are going to compete for a play in spot next year 7. Bol bol is being under used and under developed under Mike malone 8. Phil jackson is the most overrated coach of all time in any sport 9.  Hakeem is the ""best"" center of all time regardless of rings 10. Larry bird would be joe ingles in today's game"
Joe Ingles spoke to my university basketball team
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."

"God if u don’t like Joe Ingles, what are you even doing."
As a Jazz fan I will say the first good look our organization got of Joe Ingles was in summer league. Sometimes you find diamonds.
"Sure, in terms of pure numbers there’s not a huge difference, but the difference mostly manifests itself in terms of how you’re defended. Guys who shoot better have more gravity. Most of that gravity concept has to do with volume so it’s not that big of an issue, but otherwise you’re calling someone like Danuel House (career 36.5% shooter on 6.4 attempts per 36) equally as valuable as a shooter as someone like Danny Green (career 40% shooter on 6.8 attempts per 36).  If you break down most of the elite 3 point shooters, their net effect in terms of raw points is not that significant. Joe ingles shot 45%, but if he only shot 40%, the amount of points per game that would have been lost would be about .9. Compare with Markkanen who, if he shot 36% last year on the same volume, would have lost 0.7 points per game."
JJ Redick  Joe Ingles  Kevin Love  Gordon Hayward  Steph Curry
"I loathe Joe Ingles. Not because he’s a bad dude. But because whenever he plays against us, the argument for GOAT is clear and it isn’t even close."
Joe Ingles and Joe Harris were definitely the first two names that came to mind for me.

&gt;Joe Ingles was hitting me up
"If Joe Ingles really wanted, he could wipe away any NBA player of his choosing from existence and sweep the league for the rest of eternity. The only reason why he doesn’t is because of the Herculean strength of his self-control."
Joe Ingles
"&gt;He shot 45%. 45% on about 5 attempts a game is elite by any measure.  He's 68th in the league in volume, that's kinda the point. He's significantly behind players like Joe Harris and Joe Ingles, for example."
If he works hard he could be Joe Ingles
I'd love to get on the piss with Joe Ingles!
" I think the transition will be somewhat smoother than some suggest.  Gid was a starter for the Adelaide 36ers in the NBL, then played for Australia's team Boomers with teammates Joe Ingles, Aaron Baynes and Patty Mills, exposing him to high levels of international basketball before even stepping foot on an NBA court. That's arguably better for acclimating players into the NBA than the NCAA - filled with one and done prospects."
"I mean, Joe Ingles came in second for 6MOTY and he's not a bench chucker.."
"The team smashed it! Patty ofc was the key, but Joe Ingles played an incredible second fiddle, along with Exum and Thy"
Joe ingles
Patty Mills started playing for the Boomers in 2007 and Joe Ingles started in 2008... They've been in this for the long haul and this is their first Olympic medal. Awesome
The commentators weren’t ready for Joe ingles team speeches lol
"Honestly, the biggest surprise for me in this entire tourney was how foul-mouthed Joe Ingles is."
Uncle Joe Ingles for the big boards and PG handles.

Jazz because of Joe Ingles
I mean maybe the Clips would've made the finals if Joe Ingles hadn't bumped him on that fast break.
Well if they say he’s not the best player it’s because they think it’s Gobert (who also happens to be Black). It’s not like they are claiming Joe Ingles is the best player because he’s white.

Paddy mills  Joe Ingles  Matisse Thybulle  That new kid   Here are some aussie names to pay more attension to instead of this flog.
God gave us Aussies Patty Mills and Joe Ingles in the likeability stakes and the price we had to pay was Ben Simmons.
I think if they wanted to make an argument like that it should have been centered on how much attention white role players get vs. black role players(like the obsession with Caruso and Joe Ingles) rather than with Luka lol  If anyone put up the numbers Luka is they'd get a lot of attention

joe ingles choking here
Lol Durant and Holiday are the team right now the box score is brutal. What the fuck is up with everyone? Like I’ve watched Dame school the shit out of Joe Ingles many times. Why isn’t that happening now?
by god that's Joe Ingles music
"Mavs, Suns, then Joe Ingles in that order"
Not Joe Ingles
"You just contradicted yourself ? You can’t transfer the virus if you don’t have it, but you just said vaccinated people can transfer it but can’t get it from other people???  And that’s not how vaccines work. Vaccines require everybody to be vaccinated for it to work, so the disease can die out. In Portland a few years back there was an outbreak of measles or small pox or whatever it was. The reason there was an outbreak is cause an vaccinated kid in school somehow caught it, and it spread through the rest of the school. The vaccine works by building antibodies that fight back against it in the body in an attempt to kill the strain. With a vaccine you have significantly lower risk to catch or transfer it, but it’s still a risk if you’re directly exposed to it via someone who has it.   It’s especially an issue when people are immunally compromised or have close family that are, such as Kat and all of his deceased relative or Joe Ingles and his son."
Mitchell fumbled a rebound at the very end of a game last season that wouldve given him the triple double.  Awesome reaction by Joe ingles just pointing and laughing at him for missing the triple double
Surprise Joe ingles didn’t get it
We could've Joe Ingles but Doc waived him. Missed opportunities.
"But it would take way more than Donovan Mitchell is my point. They're a contender because they got Gobert at 27th overall. For good but not great teams that draft outside the lottery it's incredibly hard to find those difference makers. There might only be 1 all-star outside the lottery in a given year and there are lots of teams picking. Well run teams find and develop those players more often than poorly run teams for sure, as a Raps fan I see that firsthand almost every year but even with all that turning the team into a Brooklyn or LA level contender is really difficult because you end up having to find a big-time talent either in the 20s or the 2nd round and some years there might not even be one. Like people shit on Portland for not building a contender around Dame without really acknowledging that it's pretty hard, they weren't some incompetent front office, they picked CJ with the highest pick they had during Dame's tenure and then it's hard to see what the path to contention was beyond what they've already experienced. I would look at Portland as an example of a small market team that was pretty well run but never got that luck that they needed. You can't expect a front office to nail every single pick no matter how good they are so barring that it's hard to see how they could have gotten there. So many things have to go right that are out of that team's control. If the Raps traded for Kawhi these days they would be giving up Siakam, OG and then probably like 4 picks and swaps, not winning because they gave up pieces and then having no future after Kawhi leaves. I'm not saying rules need to change or something this is just the reality of team building without big name free agents but I just don't like players signing long term getting all their money and then just demanding a trade. And the Zion stuff is annoying because how can you expect a team to go from drafting 1st overall to a contender in like two years. I guess my point is that you can get the Donovan Mitchell type or the Siakam type that turn your team into a playoff team but getting from there to a championship is incredibly difficult. That all-star you drafted has to be like a top 10 player which are hard to find or you have to find a similar caliber player outside the lottery. Utah is a great example. They have basically done everything right, they drafted an all star in the lottery, they found an all NBA player outside the lottery, they found an elite role player in Joe Ingles and acquired a nice complimentary piece in Mike Conley and yet here they are just a 2nd round out. That's why it's hard because you can do everything right and still not really even come that close if you don't get the opportunity to sign or trade for top players."
"I like to imagine Hinkie staring at Fultz with the 3rd pick, and deciding to trade down with the Jazz, swapping our 3rd for their 13th and an under-the-radar Joe Ingles. We draft Mitchell with the 13th pick."
&gt; made more career 3s than Joe Ingles   why did you think this was a good point lol   shocker the guy who played 18 seasons has made more 3s than the guy whos played 7 as a role player
3s weren’t emphasized in the 90s you dolt. Jordan put up 1.7 per game. Stockton put up 1.3 and has made more career 3s than Joe Ingles. You think John Stockton wouldn’t be practicing 3s and shooting more volume in today’s game?
"Joe Ingles, I'm bored of living (fuck lockdown) and the trash-talking would be fantastic."

"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."

"He’s an elite three point shooter and shot creator.  I can get more into the numbers if you want but it was getting long so just going to bring up a few points but there’s more data in support of this and many writers/analysts have echoed my claim.  Tatum is 19th in career 3 point % among active players. Of the 18 guys ahead of him, only Steph has been assisted on a lower % of his 3 point makes than Tatum has been: 61.7 vs 64.7 though Steph is also 3rd in career 3pt% which is insane. Meanwhile 12 of the other 17 were assisted in at least 90% of their made 3s. Expand the list to top 30, and the only other guy that qualifies is Kyrie who’s ranked 25th and has a crazy low % of assisted 3s.   Bball index’s perimeter shooting metric is very high on Tatum. It had him as the 8th best perimeter shooter in the nba this past season as well as the 2020 season. The players ahead of him for 2021 were Steph, Dame, Duncan Robinson, LaVine, Joe Harris, Hield, and Ingles. In 2020, it was Dame, Harden, Duncan Robinson, Bertans, Hield, JJ Redick, and Devonte Graham."
"Just the many unknowns on our team.  Our defense plummets when Gobert sits, but we got Whiteside to hopefully replicate at least 25% of Rudy does. He might drive Quin, Ingles, and Conley crazy on offense though.  Last year we lacked size at the 4, we got Rudy Gay to help with that but he's old and still considered a tweener 3-4. I don't have any expectation from Paschall tbh because while he looked good in the Warriors tanking season, it was just that, a tanking season and we probably signed him more likely cause he's Donovans super close friend.   Playmaking/age/health: We have Conley, Ingles, and Donovan as our playmakers but Conley is rarely healthy for a full season, and Joe has been looking washed more and more often the past 2 seasons. Depending on Donovan too much might lead to the ankle situation all over again."

My personal fav is when Joe Ingles became franchise all-time leader in 3pt FGM. Craig Bolerjack is the GOAT.  https://youtu.be/bL2Kb9aCx3c

"Jokes aside, Joe Ingles send to be a great time model for aspiring dads, and for especially those dads that have kids with a disability"
Joe Ingles is for the children.
I’d probably put Drummond on the hated team over Gobert and maybe Joe Ingles over Middleton for loved (although that’d skew the parity)? But overall fun exercise and good picks.
Joe Ingles.
Its really quite simple. Is this a rhetorical question? Paul george has had numerous horrific elimination game performances. Not to mention the expectations if the relative teams. Clippers were a massive favorite in the denver series then proceed to lose a 3-1 lead. Even earlier he got meme’d by joe ingles. Now these losses dont completely fall on him but its hard to forget and its easy to know why he has that reputation.
"One thing You see when you step back and look at the “story” of a lot of the guys people complain about being  dirty players, your Jae crowders, your pat bevs or your Joe Ingleses(Ingles? Inglesi?) is that these are guys who really grinded to even get here, because they were never supposed to.  They’re playing against guys who have known they would make it to this point since they were 12. And they had to outlasted a lot of guys much more set up for success.   Another thing you notice about those guys is they all have short or easily shortened first names"
"I mean.. Joe Ingles is the GOAT Aussie, so why not follow the Jazz? I also hear to this day, that some Jazz fans still have real estate on Exum Island soooo..."

"&gt;or just completely shit the bed like he did vs Houston a couple of years back  Lmao, it was his sophomore year and he was the only actual scoring threat as a significant underdog to the Rockets.   It was Mitch, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors, Jae Crowder, Rudy Gobert, Royce O'Neale, and Joe Ingles as the guys that played significant minutes."

Joe Ingles
"Welcome to the Doc experience. At least he's not your GM, too. He's a Hall of Fame Xs and Os guy when he has multiple Hall of Famers running the offense. He's a great players' coach and locker room leader as long as everyone is already getting along. Go ask Ray Allen, Jared Dudley, Joe Ingles,ReggieBullocknaterobinso.......\*trails off\*"
What he’s saying doesn’t even make sense. A lot of these players look much smaller on TV than they really are since they’re constantly surrounded by very big outlier humans.  You constantly have people acting like even a really big guy like Joe Ingles looks like your average joe when he’d be very conspicuous anywhere. And I don’t think that’s just an unathletic white guy stereotype. People way underestimate just how big all of these guys are all the time.

PG Giannis SG Thon Maker SF Joe Ingles PF Bol Bol C Tacko Fall  6th man Isaiah Thomas  does this team break the warriors regular season record?
"Mitchell, Gobert, Conley, Bogdanovic, Clarkson.  So best we’d have available is Royce O’Neale, Joe Ingles, and Rudy Gay."
Joe Ingles did an interview about this game a while back and said they (the jazz) couldn’t really do much of a pre-game shoot around because the press were all there but Kobe gave them all signed shoes after the game.
I wasn’t talking about gobert I was talking about the other members of the Jazz. When Paul George can get by everyone else on the Jazz and Gobert moves to block him that’s going to leave an open man on the perimeter who can shoot a three the other Jazz players need to rotate to defend him but Joe Ingles was playing to many minutes and is getting old as he couldn’t. Donavan Mitchell and Conley were both injured so they couldn’t and bogdonavic is to slow defensively to do it none of that is on Gobert.
My dude!  Salute for the Joe ingles highlight.  Keep singing the praises and enjoy the ride.  I love that guy so much
"That being said, fuck joe ingles…"
Joe ingles
"If Joe Ingles is a plus athlete and has better breakdown handles, is he an all-star lock?  Giddey can be much better than that. Function of work ethic and team culture"
Yeah that’s just one of those where you don’t have time to bring the ball down for a true jumper but you’re too far to do a layup/don’t want to dribble towards the basket. You almost have to be this stiff and really gotta flick your wrist. Joe ingles does this for catch and shoot 3s sometimes
"Anybody in the league that is annoying af like this for genuine reasons related to basketball is always someone you hate on other teams, but would absolutely love them on yours. For me it’s guys like Norman Powell, Jae Crowder, Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood, Derrick White, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, etc… fuck all those dudes, until they join my squad, then they’re my dudes lol. I realize Jamal Murray is a guy like this for people outside of Denver lol."
"Also in the 20216-17 season:  Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside and DeAndre Jordan were starters who led the league in rebounds and were near the top in blocks.  Isaiah Thomas was the league's 3rd leading scorer.  John Wall led the league in steals and was 3rd in assists (edging out Ricky Rubio for his spot).  Kyle Korver, Allen Crabbe, Joe Ingles and Otto Porter were top 4 in 3pt accuracy.  DeMarcus Cousins set the high water mark for personal fouls.  Westbrook is the 4th oldest guy out of all the players I mentioned here."
Doesn't joe ingles count?
Don’t know that it’s unpopular but my biggest gripe is that intentional fouls to stop a fast break should be legislated out of the game. Joe Ingles was rightly ejected the other night for a dangerous foul but Kawhi tore his ACL on a seemingly innocuous intentional foul by the same player attempting to stop a fast break.   If refs can give a basket that never went in for goal tending they can give one when a player intentionally fouls to stop the fast break I reckon.
"Joe Ingles, but that might be me being pissed because he injured Kawhi"
Until the Sixers trade Joel Embiid for Joe Ingles.
"First off, that announcer is trash for lack of respect for other people. the other team is your opponent, not inhuman. Always think if the roles were reversed, if your player got fouled like that how would you respond.     I am a Jazz fan and last week Joe Ingles got ejected for doing a much softer foul on Davion Mitchell, and it was justified because contact in the air is seriously dangerous. This should have been at minimum a Flagrant 1 because it could have resulted in greater injury for Giddey. Contact in the air is serious and ""superstars"" should not be exempt from it."
"Embiid gets this called as a regular foul, meanwhile Joe Ingles is getting ejected for trying to avoid running into a player....this league makes a whole lotta sense sometimes."
Joe Ingles is from Adelaide him and Giddey did reverse career start Ingles went to Melbourne Giddey went to Adelaide
Joe ingles got ejected the other night against the kings for exactly this
"Yes, but is Patty Mills not above Joe Ingles?"
The best two players are a guy who won’t play and joe ingles  They might not win a game
Joe Ingles got ejected on Friday for less than this on the same type of play.
Joe Ingles gets a flagrant 2 because he ran into a jumping player while trying to slow down. Joel tries to commit murder and its a common foul.
The only correct answer is Joe Ingles.
"Chris Paul, Kiss Joe Ingles, Marry Donovan Mitchell"
Yeah that’s significantly more dangerous than Joe ingles play yesterday...  Joe got ejected and Book doesn’t even get a foul...
Joe Ingles… I just don’t like the way he looks
"Somewhere, Joe Ingles just angrily crinkled a can of VB"
"Wait, nothing was called for that, but Joe Ingles got thrown out yesterday for barely touching a player?"
Probably not Joe Ingles.
"Trae, Joe Ingles, Devin Booker"
There is something about Joe Ingles that just makes me want to punch him. Hate that dude with the passion of a thousand suns
"After Joe Ingles hits a layup. "" I tell ya Matt it's like watching a lazy river, that's what we're gonna call it, the lazy river"""
"What do the nba rules say, cause if you go and search for the landing rule on Nba video rulebook you can clearly see that shooters land 1-2 ft in front Look at this video, full of shooters landing in front Curry, Joe Ingles, CJ, Patty Mills, Graham, Jamal Murray, Beasly. https://youtu.be/IUDJpB9UbQc  In FIBA they state that your cylinder lenght is lenght of when you put ball in front of you with your arms half bent on your elbows, but in NBA that is in practice a little more. https://youtu.be/mMaAAANyP8Q from same game his foot moves for more than one shoe lenght which is easy more than 1ft."
"They should call this play more often. I like Joe Ingles, but thats dangerous. Just give up the points."
It’s joe ingles. He’s unable to jump
I definitely trust your reasoning u/ignitionnight \[UTA\] Joe Ingles
Dangerous play mixed with Joe Ingles doesn’t exactly have a good Reputation
Fuck Joe Ingles
"Sorry Jazz fans, I guess we're rivals now. Alex Len is going to kill you, and Joe Ingles will be sent to prison, where he belongs"
Fuck Joe Ingles
"Because if he did a normal dunk or layup there is no contact at all. Because people run at the transition dunk all the time to pressure a mistake, because it might not have even been a flagrant 1 if it was Lebron? Plenty of reasons.   Joe Ingles is an ass on the court, but not the kind of guy to try and hurt someone."
"It is a dangerous play for sure. Doesn't change what I said, if that was Lebron and not Joe Ingles they wouldn't call a flagrant 2."
"Weak call, but they better call this all season for consistency to protect the players then. If that was Lebron and not Joe Ingles I don't think that is a flagrant 2"
Jingles got ejected because Davion went for a dangerous play and swung his leg out at Ingles. Joe shouldn’t be punished for Mitchell’s recklessness.
Joe Ingles is and always has been a dirty player.
Joe ingles is dirty as fuck get his bitch ass out of there
"&gt;and having Larry who is a smart defender but I struggle to see him adjusting to the pace of this NBA compared to the older pace where he could defend.  Good defense has more to do with effort than foot speed or athleticism. It helps to be fast and jump high, but Joe Ingles is a better defender than say Kyrie Irving. Kyle Anderson is a better defender than Tyler Herro. LeBron can take the faster player of the 3/4 position if it's a concern"
I'm a homer for Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles vs Josh Giddey  Aussie on Aussie crime
"TBF, if you get a FaceTime call from Joe Ingles, your first thought might not be professional athlete."
Joe Ingles  Pat Beverly  Trae Young  Chris Paul  Bonus: Last night Jordan Poole had one possession where he forearm shivered Lebron's back multiple times and got called for a foul. THAT was grumpy old school defense.
does Joe Ingles have a big fanbase in aussie land. i hope he does
Joe Ingles
Shame we never got to see Patty Mills play with Joe Ingles in the NBA
Jinglin' Joe Ingles of course
Let's not forget about Australian superstar Joe Ingles
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
"2001 Lakers   Fisher - George Hill  Kobe - Honestly cant think of a comp for young Kobe. If LaVine was also all defensive hes probably closest.   Fox - Joe Ingles   Grant -Taj Gibson maybe  Shaq - Giannis, Embiid is closer to the body type but he takes even more jumpers than AD"
"Caruso went from the biggest market to the 3rd biggest market and also this sub loves white players, especially white players that look like average Joes (literally for Joe Ingles). Also former Lakers players get attention from Lakers fans still following their former players, if Caruso started in the league on a different team he would be less known, if THT started his career on a different team he would be unknown."
Joe Ingles for years
"this just in, joe ingles only listens to the goat, gunna."
"Yeah I mean Steph, Lebron, KD, and Embiid absolutely dominate George Hill, Rodney McGruder, Maurice Harkless, PJ Washington, and Kevon Looney, but do Mike Conley, Demar DeRozoan, Julius Randle, and Domantas Sabonis beat Jordan Clarkson, Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Bobby Portis, and Montrezl Harrell?  Probably not."
&gt;And TISM  Joe Ingles gets asked: 'What are ya? Yob or wanker?'
I am joe ingles....
I'm two years younger than Joe Ingles and I have no idea what CLB or Donda is?
Protect Joe Ingles at all costs
i mean even someone like jordan clarkson or joe ingles is better than kyrie literally not playing   not saying they should do this but it’s something to consider
"""Hilltop Hoods &gt; Kanye and Drake"" - Joe Ingles (probably)"
I know right? Joe Ingles gets to earn generational wealth by playing basketball and is a legend in his country but damn what a fucking loser
"“yb better” -Joe Ingles, probably"
"He's great in transition, and is more of a secondary ball handler on offense. On offense he's ideal role should be more like Joe Ingles. Hasn't showed enough to be the main facilitator."
"I am, from Adelaide where Giddey played last year and Joe Ingles is also from here."
I give Luka   Pg: Luka  Sg: Jamal Murray   Sf: Joe Ingles   Pf: pascal siakam   C: myles turner   Sixth mans : carmelo/ derrick rose.  Base off your criteria and realistic cap space. These players would fit his skill set.
"The video almost seems like a joke, playing techno over a sloth making layups and uncontested 3s. I'm saying this as a Joe Ingles fan too"
&gt; Mentioned Joe Ingles as a player he kind of modeled his game after.  [It shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjcIe8c-Oq8)
What has Joe Ingles done to you?
"I've seen people in this thread compare him to: Larry Bird, Steve Nash, Luca Doncic and Joe Ingles and I am beginning to notice a trend"
I think the connotation is slightly different in this particular example. Joe Ingles looks like an anthropomorphized hangover.
"1. he doesn't fit with the bulls. lonzo need the ball in his hands, just like simmons though he cannot create for himself in a half court setting. but he doesn't need to because lavine will take 20 shots, derozan and vuc both are scorers. adding kyrie makes no sense. and who is to say derozan isn't the 4 this year anyway, did u forget about patrick williams at the 3?  2. this isn't 2K dude. murray for kyrie is a terrible trade. just because you think talent and fit wise it would work, you need to take into considerstion context and situation. no way the nuggets risk trading jamal murray, homegrown guy who has great chemistry with the team, for a headcase like kyrie  3. Kyrie would not want to play with LeBron ""father figure"" James ever again. And they just traded for Westbrook. As if they trade for Kyrie  4. Sixers want to trade Ben Simmons. The organisation (Morey) is not trading him for Kyrie. Needs to maximise Embiid's window, trading for Ky who can't even play in philly is not doing that pal  5. You can't even spell Joe Ingles' name. But this is the funniest one by far. No team says yes to this one🤣 not even the Nets."
"Somewhere between Joe Ingles and Luka, he's sneaky"
Josh Giddey is Jason Kidd in Grant Hill's body with the athleticism of Joe Ingles.
"at some point this year, more people will know about austin reaves than joe ingles"
He’s like a cross between Isaiah Thomas and Joe Ingles.
"I work at a coffee shop in Downtown Dallas that happens to be across from the hotel that all NBA teams stay at. No in-depth interactions, but little convos here and there with Joe Ingles, Blake Griffin, Rudy Gay, and we see Mavs guys a lot (Boban, KP)"
Joe Ingles
"So basically the Jazz with Shai? I wouldn't have him starting over Conley either. Also Joe Ingles doesn't start for us now, he probably wouldn't be starting for us on a combined team."
Klay seems like the coolest dude. Shoutouts to Joe Ingles and Steven Adams though
Hell yeah Joe Ingles FMVP here we come!
"Fox for Simmons plus 2-3 FRPs could work out well for the Kings.  Morey would hate giving up the picks, which is a good sign that it's a fair deal, but would have little choice. Depending on how much you believe in Mitchell this would give the Kings a great chance to make the playoffs this season or next.  The trick would be figuring out how to get the best out of Simmons. I'd also look at trading for Joe Ingles to give Ben some veteran leadership from a fellow Aussie."
"joe ingles has one of the slowest releases ever if he catches the ball beneath his shoulders, and one of the quickest if he catches it above his shoulders"
"Question from NBA.com’s GM Survey 2021-22:  Which active player will make the best head coach someday?  1. Chris Paul, Phoenix – 34%  2. Rajon Rondo, Lakers – 14%  3. T.J.

Joe Ingles passes up wide open 3's despite being a top shooter in the league and it's upsetting.

"I came in here to say Joe Ingles and I got beaten to the punch by Nitro, so I'll proffer a second name: Royce O'Neale. Multiple times last season, I saw him turn down wide open wing 3's only to pass to a guy who was covered. Frequently, it was in the middle of the extra pass action, but his defender was so far away, I was just like I get that's muscle memory, but you gotta take that shot bro, we aren't getting a better one this possesesion."
"Through 60 regular season games this season Joe Ingles was producing the single greatest TS% season of all-time.      He literally only had 3 moves. Catch and shoot three, off the dribble step back three, driving pass fake layup.      He's really good when he's taking 15+ shots but he always looks to pass first and sometimes it's to the detriment of the team because he turns down a good look to try and get an even better one for a teammate. He's been top 5 in the league for 3P% in three seasons now and he's such a good shooter that we just need him pulling up as often as possible but he's also a playmaker and cares too much about being unselfish."
Joe Ingles.  Yall aint ready for the shit-talk king
JOE INGLES  i know hes going to move back to oz but the consensus in utah is that he'd be a fantastic color commentator/analyst when he retires
I guess but I think it’s kind of easy to parse the valid arguments and the nonsense. Some crazy take like “Joe ingles is better than Donovan mitchell because he has a higher EPM” wouldn’t get any traction.
A faster Joe Ingles?

"Joe Ingles for LeBron, AD, and future draft picks"
Joe Ingles 6th man
Joe Ingles
yeah but when he does play he is easily top 5. i mean he didn't really miss many games last year until joe ingles ended his season so I don't really see health as a point against him

Joe Ingles
I’m surprised no one has mentioned joe ingles. That dude looks like my 7th grade science teacher and moves like him too.
"Assuming we're building a team to take part in the 2021-22 season (all peak years are IMO ofc):  **PG: LeBron James** (career 27.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 09, 12, 13, 16  **SG: Danny Green** (career 8.9ppg) --- Peak versions: 13, 14, 16  **SF: Joe Ingles** (career 8.7ppg) --- Peak versions: 17, 18, 21  **PF: Robert Horry**  (career 7.0ppg) --- Peak versions: 94, 95, 01, 05, 07   **C: Draymond Green** (career 8.8ppg) --- Peak versions: 15, 16, 17  rationale: lebron + shooting is a tried and tested formula so here are 3 shooters plus peak draymond  who could occasionally knock down open 3s too (34.4% from 3 in 61 playoff games from 2015-17). All of them are at least solid defenders with some elite ones. Draymond and Jingles are both excellent ballhandlers/passers who can relieve some of the offensive burden on lebron. Might have to ask Horry to become the roll man in some sets ig, im not super familiar w his game haha"
"Respectfully, Slow mo Joe Ingles. Just a standard guy with nothing special going on, just a slew of fakes and a huge bball IQ."
"BJ Armstrong, Tony Allen, Joe Ingles, LeBron James, Dikembe Mutumbo  Bench: Rondo, Rodman, Jared Dudley, Shane Battier, Ben Wallace.  A pair of defensive anchor 5s, size that can shoot, guards that can shoot, a lot of positional flexibility for LeBron to play either forward spot or PG. With a ‘13-‘16 era LeBron this roster wins 55 games minimum imo. Tempted to replace Rodman with Draymond but imo this team has some playmakers as it is i think Rodman fits better as a defensive gadget"
Joe ingles for sure!
"Joe Ingles is my pick. Aside from being 6'8"" nothing says ""athlete"" about him anymore. He barely jumps and is slow as shit, but he has just enough lateral movement to be an excellent defender."
"Joe Ingles looks like a burnt out history teacher, but every fan base has a story about the night Joe fucked them."
"I like Isaiah Joe, but I don't have him above Ingles."
"Shooting. We could really use a third wing who can space the floor at an elite level while not being a huge defensive liability— a 3&amp;D player like Mikal Bridges would be awesome, but even a Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, or Bogdan Bogdanovic type would be fine with our other defensive pieces. People have been overstating our need for playmaking, we've got a bunch of really solid passers (Smart, Schroder, Al, even Tatum when he wants to be) and we'd be averaging more assists if we had guys who could consistently knock down open shots."
#Top 5  1) Joe  2) Ingles  3) Jingles  4) Jinglin' Joe  5) Jinglin' Joe Ingles
"Ain’t worried about no Joe ingles , patty miles or no mf Ben Simmons   N who was that light skinned bum on the jazz . Exum. Lmaoo   Remove the Australians . They are the Wish App British"
"That first 50-win Jazz squad of this decade with Hayward, Hill, Gobert, Favors, Joe Johnson, Hood and Ingles was crazy good when they were healthy. But Hayward missed the first 2 or 3 weeks, Favs got banged up and Hill had turf toe all year causing him to miss a total of like 40 games plus some playoff games. And they still won 50 games  They ran into the KD Warriors buzzsaw in the 2nd round after blowing up the Lob City Clippers. If not for the Warriors I think that team could've been WCF-bound, if not Finals bound"
Yeah or maybe like a Kevin Love/Tyler Herro/Steve Adams/Luka/Caruso/Joe Harris/Joe Ingles/Duncan Robison with a splash of DiVencenzo

Joe Ingles' son is autistic and he works with charities for intellectually disabled children.
"*Caruso makes a simple, open dunk*  r/nba: CARUSO BRINGS DOWN THE HOUSE WITH A MONSTER JAM!!!!  *Joe Ingles goes 5/8 from 3*  r/nba: JINGLES RED HOT FROM DOWNTOWN!! PUT THIS MAN IN THE 3 POINT CONTEST"
"The Clippers were a Joe Ingles shove away from winning it all last season, no one can match up with their small ball lineup on either end of the floor with their switching defense and elite 3 point shooting   Only the Nets have a prayer of beating them by fighting fire with even more fire (at least on paper) and even then I’m confident that the Clippers defense will prevail over the Nets lack of defense"
That’s a Joe Ingles flagrant 2
Having Patty Mills and Joe Ingles on the same team would be too much for the league to handle
I'd probably say Joe ingles
"That surprises me. I know Joe Ingles as a hard working, hustle and hound on defense type of player. I know he's getting older but thats sad to hear"
"Royce O'Neale. Before last year, I thought he was extremely overrated and didn't bring much to the team. A three now and then, and some OK defense. Last year, he really stepped up his defense, his 3 point shooting, and I completely changed my mind on him.  On Joe Ingles, I wasn't watching much when we first signed him. I didn't get the point of signing him just to keep watch over Exum. Started watching more the next year and did a 180, plus a couple back flips, a hand stand, and built a shrine to Jinglin Joe."
"Joe Ingles' shooting percentages are nice, but he's not played well this season. He might be the worst defender on our team and he doesn't care about hustling or getting back on defense. He's also passing up too many open looks. Our opponents are also switching everything on pick and rolls against us, and Ingles can't break down defenses in isolation so he's struggling to playmake."
"Can’t wait till he plays on the Australian team at the next Olympics.  Giddey, Thybulle and Josh Green will all be going into their prime. Patty will probably have one last run before he retires.  Still have Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Jock Landale and Aron Baynes.  X-Factor is if Ben Simmons finally joins. Figure he has a shot at it if he wants to redeem his image."
"Conley’s impact this year has really shown up when you look at the lineups. The Jazz essentially runs three different groups each half- the starters, then a Mitchell-Whiteside led group, A Rudy-Conley group-Mitchell-Whitside again and then the starters to finish.  That third group so far has basically always had Rudy Gobert, Eric Paschall (though probably now Rudy Gay), Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson. The difference between have Conley with that group vs anyone else is staggering. These are the lineups with those 4 (Rudy Pashcall Ingles Clarkson)  Conley- +11.3 net rtg (113 min)  Butler -4.3 net rtg (21 min)  Forest -12.7 net rtg (21 min)   Mitchell -64 net rtg (8 min)  Conley’s ability to floor general that unit in particular is so incredibly valuable."
Joe Ingles.  So fast he looks like he's moving in slow motion.
Something about Joe Ingles makes me think everything he says is filled with wisdom.

Cade doesn't have an explosive first step, but he does have a quick one and does get by defenders 1v1 with his step and handle.  Dunks have nothing to do with blowing by a defender. Kyrie isn't dunking on people, but he does blow by players.  And no, Steph would not be applicable to ""super good 3 point shooter."" The greatest shooter of all time is not a ""super good 3 point shooter."" Joe Ingles is a super good 3 point shooter, Steph is the greatest shooter."
World isn't ready for the goat Joe Ingles to start taking shots at world leaders
And it's part of why it's good Joe Ingles always declines
"I think A.d. would work better with Rudy gobert. He's a juiced up javal Mcgee and Dwight Howard since he doesn't like playing  the 5 often.   Giannas and Jokic would be crazy with Murray running the offense or Middleton.   I got Monte Morris, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, giannas and jokic.   Dennis Schroder,  Mitchell ,  Joe Ingles . A.d. gobert"
Joe Ingles is pretty good defensively despite being one of the least athletic dudes in the league
I had a bad dream the other night that we traded Ben for joe ingles and a first round pick
"Counter point, Jazz passes per game have gone down dramatically this year and aren't running the pick and roll as efficiently which started all that ball movement.  Joe Ingles gone from ageless to playing like is 50 as well."
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
I think Joe Ingles would be a really good fit on that roster
I just want a Joe Ingles feed. The amount of c-bombs would be magical
"Didn’t watch that. I mean some players can be jerks at times but they are just people. Whenever we played the jazz, I was always surprised how much shit Joe ingles talked. It was so funny and incredible. We’d be helping him warm up and he’d be saying how passing the ball to him and helping him warmup would help him torch us."
"Gary Payton II, Cam Payne, PJ Tucker, Joe Ingles etc"
We need to rest Joe Ingles. Like he’s not contributing much of anything tired. Mike has seemed off as well lately.  Overall we need to get tougher. We’re softer than fucking 4-ply
"Credits where credits are due still. Props to players not giving up at the end, I do think this will make a different in terms of morals for the next few games. Now, can we just rest Joe Ingles some fames like what we do to Conley, old man need breaks man."
"two of these guys are memes: duncan robinson, joe ingles  one of these guys plays on the best team in the league: seth curry  one of these guys plays for a team of mercenaries: joe harris  And then there's Buddy Hield, who is the best player on this list."
"&gt;He only became a 3P shooter very recently.  i dunno about this... he shot a career high 45.1% on a career high 6.1 3PA last season, but he seems to have always shot well on respectable volume.  his career average is 41.4% on 4.4 3PA, and he's always attempted more threes than twos.  https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2968436/joe-ingles"
"No. Their roles are similar but how and where they get their shots are not   All these guys you listed are all different players because of their weakness even if their best strength is 3 point shooting. Some with size, some can defend better than others, some actually has on ball creating skill and off the dribble pull up… thus their preferred way of getting 3 point shot vary, Duncan is a one trick pony that loves his dribble hand off because he can’t put the ball down and make play off the dribble, Joe Ingles is slow but he can run PnR and get his shot off in PnR and spot up. Curry can do virtually any type of action to get his shot off"
"They are all very different players. Joe Ingles, Buddy Hield and Duncan Robinson are all *very* different players from one another"
Joe Ingles rolling in his grave
"I don't think they're undervaluing it. The two G League standouts in the NBA are defensive beasts. If they were undervaluing it, these two would never get roster spots. I think they do want more data points which is why they stash these finds in G leagues and monitor them.      It's common practice in soccer to monitor players long term and watch their progression before committing to them. It's very common for players to mature later there and be recognized in and around their prime. We've also seen similar situations in NBA with guys like PJ Tucker, Joe Ingles, etc.    Also, if they are undervaluing G League defense then that would also imply that they're undervaluing G League offense."
Why Joe Ingles get to just touch that mans face though? They were separated and he flies in squeezing cheeks like grandma.
He shoved a ref and turned around almost taking a swing around the general location of Myles.   [Live POV of Joe Ingles] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be6I7_TVUgw)
The real question is what the hell was joe ingles thinking
He's like Joe Ingles for you
He was referring to Joe Ingles
"Joe ingles is literally memed out of control because he’s white  Jalen Brunson and poetl are nowhere near as good as brogdon and probably just as well known, disagree with those  I’m literally a blazers homer and can say definitively CJ is overrated if anything  Tobias Harris is way more respected than brogdon so to say they’re equal only proves the point brogdon is underrated lol"
"Joe Ingles Jalen Brunson CJ McCollum Poetl   Brogdon is a really good player, but he’s more a Tobias Harris than anything: Really good player who isn’t near elite"

Joe “Miley Cyrus” Ingles.
Is it just me or are the Jazz announcers being bitches? Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles clearly put their hands on the refs. Donny pushed one and Joe almost hit one in the face along with pushing. And when Gobert grabbed Turner to pull him down they we acting like he didn't do anything.
"could have sworn I saw that joe ingles was retiring, did he change his mind"
Jae Crowder and Joe Ingles must be on that team as well.
"Forgot Joe Ingles. He could easily get there. 46, 43 and 100 now."
Then I saw him prancing about at Wimbledon while the boys were in Tokyo. I'd l give my left nut to spend a few weeks in camp with Patty Mills and Joe Ingles and the rest of the team!
Kawhi might be out for the year because Joe Ingles hit him in a similar fashion to this. And in a far less dirty way than what Morris did btw.  You still think it wasn't a big deal?
“Don’t mess with James Johnson” - Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles is in the Mucca Mad Boys.
"AC Green played 1,192 consecutive games. There is no way that happens with how the league has changed.   Joe Ingles was the current leader last year at 384 before missing a game."
Joe Ingles real name is Joseph   like what! crazy
"Andrew Bynum is getting old, so we need the new one (was him be the last star who quick played himself out of the league?)     BTW Joe Ingles is younger than Andrew Bynum"
i hope derrick and carmelo enjoy the view behind joe ingles in this race
you buried the lede a little here  you mean joe ingles?
"Is it Joe Ingles? Can't tell from your flair. If it is, I'm listening. Would love to get jingled right before the holidays."
Did Joe ingles get traded to the nets or thunder?
You forgot the time he grabbed joe ingles leg
They have Joe Ingles. That’s the only thing they needed
"nah joe ingles is a tradie for sure, sparky or something"
"Reminds me of the time he tripped Joe Ingles from the floor 2 years ago, not as bad as this but disappointing that he still can't control himself when frustrated."
"His biggest issue, IMO, is that he's not a plus passer. That would really open things up for him, potential-wise. Without a big improvement in his creation for others, I don't see how he provides value on that sort of contract. But you know, sometimes it takes guys a while to add that to their games. But if he could become, I don't know, Joe Ingles as a passer...that would cement him as a max-caliber player to me."
Seems like a weird way to spell Joe Ingles
"Well you're obviously a Harden stan, but oh well:  https://pickinsplinters.com/2020/05/14/breaking-down-james-hardens-postseason-inefficiency/  The main issue here is, just as he has forced his scoring average up by manipulating bad officiating rules, Harden has forced himself into being a mediocre shooter with poor mechanics and exceptional range, and you portray him as a great shooter. Bullshit. Stephen Curry is a great shooter, Joe Harris is a great shooter, Duncan Robinson, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, are great shooters. Harden is the China of basketball, just a manufactured knock off version of the real deal born out of a dynamic of competitive necessity following the dominance of Curry. He's boring to watch, and he won't win a ring on his own merits. Your favorite player is kind of....shit."
Like Joe Ingles of course
"Maybe?  A lot of them are still too young to tell.  Gobert with a third DPOY for sure, Mitchell if he stays at a high level for a while, Joe Ingles is the GOAT and I guess thats it."
"dante exum, joe ingles, can you believe how solid jazz is before"
LOL joe ingles look like he finished teaching high school class by day and drop 40 on you by night.
Same when people say Joe ingles looks like a teacher or something. He's 6'8
1a )Donovan Mitchell  1b) Mike Conley  1c) Bojan Bogdinovic  1d) Joe Ingles  1e) Rudy Gobert
"JJ Redick Apple Podcast called, The Old Man and the Three is great. Recently interviewed Mike Conley. Talked about how during pregame of the last Jazz/Pelicans game, JJ mentioned to Joe Ingles that Mike was gonna be on the podcast to which Joe responded something along the lines of, “What?...are you running out of guests?” Lol.   Here’s the link to the Apple Podcast Episode with Mike Conley:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-old-man-and-the-three-with-jj-redick-and-tommy-alter/id1525281746?i=1000507816801"
Larry Nance  Zion  Joe Ingles   Gary Harris  Kyle Lowry   This also might be bordering on cheating too much with too many good players but off the top of my head what I came up with. Playmaking from multiple spots in general is something I think would help any Zion offense
"Yes, it really does.  They have a clip they play introducing the ""Joe Ingles Show"".  It's not so much of a jingle, but at least it's something."
5x Joe Ingles
"joe ingles exists in a space that you cant even imagine  its somewhere between time and space, and gravity (the real 3rd dimension)...somewhere within there lies ingles. an element that will explode in your face just when you think hes a slow ass white dude"
The disrespect to Joe Ingles.
Not sure if you're getting your Joe's mixed up or if Ingles simply absorbed Joe Johnson's essence when he retired
"That was the most ""Joe Ingles"" play ever"
Joe Ingles: Math teacher Alex Caruso: Joe Ingles’ substitute math teacher
You have Joe Ingles
Can't believe Joe Ingles could have been a Clipper
He was our 3rd string PG. Joe Ingles has always been our backup Point Guard.
"Wrong: Thought Bojan would be a lot more consistent than he has been (I know he's coming off injury, but still)  Right: Joe Ingles is still the GOAT"
"No I won't lmao there are plently teams where he wouldn't be the best shooter..I'll go through the teams off of the top of my head lmao  Warriors - steph and klay obviously loool Portland - Lillard and cj Utah - Joe Ingles and Bodanvic(sp?) Nuggets - Kat would be the best here. Porter is close Suns - booker  Clippers - kwahi and pg  Lakers - Kat would be the best  Mavs - Hardaway  Rockets - Kat would be the best, Gordon possibly  Spurs - don't watch enough of them but Kat probably  Kings - budy hield  Wolves - Kat New Orleans - jj  Memphis - Kat Okc - Kat   Heat - Robinson herro  Pacers - Malcom  Hawks - trea and bogdonvic(sp?) Wizards - beal Nets - harden kyrie kd and Joe Harris lol 76sers - Seth curry and Harris  Raptors - van fleet  Knicks- kat Celtics - brown possibly Tatum Magic - Kat but possibly vucevic or Ross Charlotte - Kat  Cavs - sexton  Bucks - middleton  Bulls - lavine  Pistons - Wayne Ellington   These are litterally without thinking too hard or looking at rosters lol. This is shooting in general that I would take over Kat. Some are arguable but idk Kat isn't the best shooter on most teams in my opinion"
"PG13 already lost to Joe Ingles. And Kawhi choked last year. As far as LeBron and AD goes, yeah, they're pretty good. We'll just have to see what happens I guess."
This is basically what Joe Ingles did with the Jazz over a few years - started as an efficient spot up shooter and now is one of our primary playmakers.
The bigger question is: is Joe Ingles only allowed to win one MVP award this season?
Joe ingles
Depends if the Cavs trade for Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles is starting at the moment. ;p
"I’ve been thinking about how important having a team of role players on the jazz is. Like if I were the gm, and San Antonio offered me demar derozan for joe Ingles or even Royce, I don’t know if I could do that. Maybe I should clarify here, that I am not, in fact, a gm in the nba."

"God, I love Joe Ingles highlights. It gives hope to the bottom 10% athletes at 24 Hour Fitness that they to can be a math teacher laughing at yet another player with a 40"" vertical who fell for my 2 MPH ball-fake layup."
Joe Ingles.
Lakers. I still can't trust an all-star like PG getting outplayed by joe ingles.
Shout-out to Joe Ingles who is at 68.5% TS this year as a non big man.
"I think this is the game plan Snyder has always had, and he finally had the right team for it. The team is built around Gobert, his main role is to protect the rim. However, Gobert absolutely is not a shooter, so we can only rely on 1-4 for outside shooting. The last couple of years we generated a shit ton of open shots, but we never had the players to consistently drain them - Rubio, Favors (as PF starter), Crowder etc. Now all of the starters on the floor not named Gobert are excellent 3pt sharpshooters. The Jazz run a ton of screens &amp; switches, and their ball movement is incredible. Also the bench. Jordan Clarkson is a madman. Favors had only spent 1 season away from Utah his entire career - which was last season. He already has deep chemistry with this core. He comes off the bench and slides into the backup C role, where Tony Bradley &amp; Ed Davis severely lacked last year - defensively and getting boards. Add Joe Ingles and Georges Niang to the mix, and you’ve got a deep team."
They don’t call Steph curry the American Joe Ingles for nothing
He's a fucking 7 foot Joe Ingles... surprised he hasn't conquered the whole world
Joe Ingles
* Clarkson takes 3s instead of 2s. MF also plays defense now.  * Mitchell is a better passer and has better vision. Improved on Defense.  * Mike Conley understands the system. Better on Defense this season.  * Bojan is healthy.   * Joe Ingles is resurgent.   * Derrick Favors is the backup C instead of Tony Bradley (when Utah would hemorrhage points on the bench).  * Royce O'Neale decided he wanted to be a rebounding god and added elite rebounding to his top shelf 3&amp;D skillset.
"That's nothing, players should 100% on Joe Ingles assists this season."
He’s a high flyer that Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
Are you saying Joe Ingles isn't a superstar?
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles amiright?
"imagine getting blocked by Joe ""4 inch vertical"" Ingles"
I did not know that joe ingles gets to the bucket at will.
That Joe Ingles is a problem
well rudy gobert is bad and royce oneal?? and joe ingles moonlights as a history teacher so idk why this is impressive
Is Joe Ingles the most gifted athlete? I’m confused at your bewilderment
"Did he just call Joe Ingles ""not the most gifted athlete?"" Excuse me?"
Congrats Joe Ingles!! Jingle all the way
Can you do this with Bill Burr and Huell from Breaking Bad but with Joe Ingles face in Bill Burr and Zion’s face on Huell?  No?  Okay thanks bye.
"First Joe Ingles (hit 384, 418 if including playoffs), now PJ Tucker. Apparently Cory Joseph is at 292 games. Does anyone have a list of the longest active consecutive games played streaks?"
"I think part of the reason Utah's bench is so good is that Clarkson is really a luxury for that bench, not a necessity. Any bench which starts with Ingles and Favors as two of the first guys off the bench has an abundance of playmaking thanks to their legendarily efficient pick-and-roll and the fact that Joe Ingles is one of the smartest passers in the NBA and can blend in well with. Those two are good enough to be starters on a solid playoff team. If you take one of the most efficient pick-and-roll tandems in the league, and elite rim protection from Favors, you can go pretty far.   Take that killer bench tandem *and* add a talented iso scorer who can take over a few possessions to give the other guys on the floor a couple of plays off, and it's no question that the Jazz have the deepest bench in the league. It isn't just a situation where he's putting up big numbers as the only capable player on the floor; the Jazz just always have at least three starter-quality players on the floor at once, so he has the luxury of not being the focal point of the opposing team's defense whenever he's on the floor."
"Love his story with how he made a career for himself in the NBA, same reason why Ingles is my favourite player.      Honesty, PJ Tucker and Joe Ingles actually have a lot in common now that I think about it. Both bounced around different countries playing international basketball before establishing themselves as key role players that would sustain incredible iron man streaks."
Just give it to Joe Ingles you cowards
Joe Ingles after hitting the game winning 3 pointer in the game 7 of the 2021 finals over Julius Randle
gobert going off right now but it could be joe ingles or royce depending on who plays better
Joe Ingles?
Joe ingles
These Lakers seem like a good team. Very interested to see if they can do it against superstars like Joe Ingles in the playoffs.
"The Jazz are another great example of this. They have the best record in the league and currently have 7 players averaging over 20 minutes a game. Of those 7 players, 5 of them are:  - Rudy Gobert - Drafted 27th overall - Bojan Bogdanovic - Drafted 31st overall - Jordan Clarkson - Drafted 46th overall - Joe Ingles - Undrafted - Royce O'Neale - Undrafted  The only players on the roster drafted higher than 27th overall are Conley, Favors, and Mitchell. Granted, some of those players like Bogie and Clarkson were well-established with other teams before joining the Jazz but I think it's cool to see a team doing so well that is mostly comprised of late-round/undrafted guys"
"And Joe Ingles  And Jordan Clarkson  And Mike Conley, depending on who you ask. I think he was playing like an all-star but the way all-star selections work, there's a small chance he gets in :'("
Joe ingles
"Being from Australia, the first thing to do is follow your fellow countrymen in the NBA as there are some quality players in the league from down under... Particularly the greatest 3-point shooting, trash talking, Aussie of all time, Jinglin' Joe Ingles!"
time to give Joe Ingles his flowers
"He can slow Mitchell down, but can he slow JOE INGLES down?? no way mate"
Have you seen Joe Ingles?? 🤔
"Jazz have Joe Ingles, advantage Jazz."
yeah and the jazz have joe ingles
"Hey man, I'm rooting for the jazz. Love watching donovan and joe ingles. If the lakers dont make it to the finals, im hoping the jazz will"
"Joe Ingles. Don't need a superstar when you can just Jingle everybody.   Real answer, Kevin Durant. Might be older, but can lead a team and still has years left."
"They are the best TEAM but they do not have a top 10 player so people have every right to be skeptic how they want to defend Lebron/AD when Murray Jokic was killing them last year, they have Joe Ingles playing SF that shit is not working against Lebron"
Are there 2 bogdan or 2 joe ingles?
I was gonna say they have no legendary streetballer but remembered Joe Ingles exists
joe ingles sir
"Definitely Quin. 76ers are loaded and play weaker teams regularly. The Jazz are freaking nuts. Their third best player is either Jordan Clarkson, or Joe Ingles. Yet look at the record they're putting up."
"I mean, Joe Ingles is a top 4 player so not really sure what point you're trying to make here"

Joe Ingles totally pushed off there so he ruined it
"Most ridiculous game ever. Jazz have a blowout victory, Devin booker has a 59 point game, and who does the Jazz arena cheer for? Jimmer who went 1-10 (0-5 from 3). I remember seeing Jae Crowder’s face was frankly just disgusted at our fan base for how insane they were going for him. I get people being a fan (I lived in Utah and played church ball during Jimmer-mania, believe me I know how much people love him here), but that means cheering for him when he checks in and maybe for his first bucket but don’t cheer louder than you have for your own team. I wanna say Joe Ingles refused to answer a question about it after the game just walked away from the reporter lmao."
so what ur saying is joe ingles mvp
Joe Ingles and Playoff P
10 Joe Ingles would beat 10 Paul Georges
And 1 Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles tied Pistol Pete for 7th most assists in Jazz history!
"My asshole clenches with fear everytime I see Joe Ingles shoot a 3, Jazz are so scary."
"In a 5v5 league, a more fluid joe ingles"
Neither is joe ingles
could you image being shit talked by 10 joe ingles for 48 minutes
A team of Joe Ingles could do it.  Defenses wouldn't know what to do.
10 Joe Ingles. Endless jingling. Jingle all the way.
10 Joe Ingles
"Joe Ingles, Tobias Harris, Jermani Grant, Mikal Bridges and more are way better than DeAndre Hunter."
Never mind. If Mike Conley/Jordan Clarkson/Joe Ingles are better playmaker then what is wrong with what Charles/Shaq are saying? Y’all should be hoping Mitchell develops to be a better playmaker than the 3 of those guys together lol.   I would say average playmaker for a point guard of all star caliber.
"Fun fact the Jazz run the offense with more than one facilitator such as Joe Ingles, Clarkson, Conley, and Mitchell. You do the math with the assists."
Joe Ingles is a bad man.
I'll always dislike it when people say that because there's so many types of jumpers.      Is it like Kyle Korver/JJ Redick where the player can hit curling jumpers off screens?        Is it like Joe Ingles where the player primarily is just a stationary catch and shoot from the corner?      It it like Serge Ibaka where the player can hit elbow pick and pops?      Is it like CJ McCollum where the player can pull up and shoot from anywhere on the court from creating their own shot?
Big fan of Joe Ingles
"Joe ingles, very good defender, can run the offense, can play off ball, attack the rim, high level shooter, great chemistry with rudy gobert. One of my favorite players ever to watch."
OOOOOOOOOF My hometown boy Joe Ingles killing it!
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles looks like some hard boiled detective who has been up for several days trying to catch a serial killer.
"Not really my friend! I respect that. I just disagree because for me the sport won’t be as interesting if everyone just dunked and played like young vince/tmac, kobe. Players’ ways to compensate for their physical limitations make the league as varied as it is now. That’s why we have a magic johnson, a larry bird, a charles barkley and so on. I enjoy watching joe ingles play, i enjoy watching the Joker play. If you mean to say you wanna see more physicality and purpose in driving to the rim then im all for it as well! I just dont agree with the notion that the high flying players of years past are the model for quality/great nba basketball. Luka and Harden are no pussies. They just exploit the rules. Paul pierce was from the era that you were talking about and he knew how to foul bait (but it was still purposeful because he was often in a triple threat situation). I think there’s a happy medium where we can all agree that skill and exploiting the rules is alright but blatantly spamming foul baiting isnt. Case in point Trae’s game this season. It’s awful and it’s not basketball."
"Joe Ingles is the best teammate not only currently, but ever."
"It's early and we've been shooting the lights out from 3 and rebounding well (though not in this game), but I can't help but have a lot of optimism about our depth right.   Clarkson has been insane in limited minutes. Conley is really returning to offensive form, probably more comfortable with our offensive system. Mitchell has had a slow start and fully expect his numbers to improve. Bojan has been recovering from an offseason surgery, I think he'll be back to form with more minutes. Royce and Niang have been looking solid shooting the 3. If Joe Ingles also finds his shot again, we just have a plethora of perimeter threats that make this offense potent from 3.   I hope we trend closer to high 40s or low 50s in threes attempted, because this roster is built for it."
Utah’s is pretty much a meme sub for Joe Ingles. I actually enjoy it honesty
"Joe Ingles, for the laffs."
Joe Ingles - legendary trash talker
Joe Fucking Ingles. Iron man.
Joe ingles
"Dude got his shit rocked by rookie Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles, he’s gotta earn that respect because I sure as hell ain’t gonna give it to him rn"
"Utah Jazz for sure. We have the league's most sympathetic and likable player, Joe Ingles. Really funny guy, you just can't hate on him. We have Donovan Mitchell, best player of his class (2017). He would have got Rookie Of The Year award but he got robbed by Ben Simmons. I don't wanna get into that, complex situation. Anyways we have Rudy Gobert, good ol French guy, best defencer in the league. He got 2 back to back Defensive Player Of The Year. And we have a really good chance to be champion this year."
"Yea facts there has not been much talk about how nice he's been this year. Really just suffering from the lack of coverage of the Jazz and it seems to be a trend for smaller market teams in general. Seems like the media, only makes room for two players from small market teams (Donovan and Gobert, Ingram and Zion, KAT and DLo, Sabonis and Brogdon, Jokic and Murray). I mean it's true that most teams have two players that garner a lot of media attention, but for small market teams there no room for the other important players. I mean it seem's like the only other dude on the Jazz who get's mentioned is Joe Ingles (although deservedly so because he's the greatest basketball player in the history of the game /s) lol but ofc he's a really more known as a meme, although he is a good role player. I mean there's barely any coverage of Bojan Bogdanovic and the dude literally averaged 20ppg last year on 60% TS..."
"Shaq does the same shit everytime he talks to Joe Ingles, he throws on a terrible Aussie impression and proceeds to throw in a shitty ""shrimp on the barbie"" joke while Joe gives a fake laugh and waits for an actual question."
"Pay attention, Joe Ingles- this is what eating minutes looks like."
Joe Ingles would be hilarious
he shouldve known 3 years ago when joe ingles was clapping cheeks
joe ingles isnt in the starting 5 mate
"Joe ingles Finals MVP, Nba DPOY, All Nba 1st team MIP and ROTY just cuz"
"It was he and Joe Ingles against the Clippers in the final game of the season,  someone had to score."
I saw Luka's ceiling as James Harden on offense and 2017 Joe Ingles on defense. That's an insane player.
"It's hard to take anything significant away from this game, really. The Cavs were severely short-handed, so a lot of bench guys got some good burn, while the Jazz were really only missing Joe Ingles (which, to be fair, is significant for them).   It's like the Jazz are the only team not dealing with COVID right now, maybe because they started this whole thing back in March. Fingers cross that it stays that way.  Bogdanovic was good again tonight. His wrist is just causing him to be so inconsistent, it's hard to know what to expect from him night to night. Sorta like Conley last season. At least Conley is back to his normal nightly performance. Once Bojan gets right, Jazz should be pretty good compared to the rest of the league.  I posted this stat in the PGT but there was a graphic that before last night's game, the Jazz were 5-1 against teams &gt;.500, but 1-3 against teams &lt;.500. They really seem to struggle to maintain a high level of play against teams they're ""supposed"" to beat. Hell, even the Pistons came back from down 20 on Sunday to make the game closer than the end results - Jazz won by 10 but it was like a 3 point game with a minute left.  Hard to put the Jazz anywhere on the power rankings when they're being so inconsistent - they're a top-4 team in the west record-wise but then they've also lost to the Timberwolves and the Knicks."
"I loved Amin, right up until that statement. Grossly underrating Fox. Also this statement is inherently disrespectful lol.   Kevin Huerter is who Joe Ingles thinks he is"
I think you're just describing Joe Ingles.
"This reminds me of the videos of Joe Ingles ""exploding to the rim"" for a dunk lmao"
What if the Clippers signed Joe Ingles instead of letting him go...
&gt;Favorite defender to watch is Joe Ingles  Wouldn't have named J.I.  in 449 guesses.  I'll have to pay more attention to Ingles' defensive chops.
"I'm a big Joe Ingles fan. I told this story on JJ's pod last year, but I actually used him as my NBA-comparison when going thru pre-draft. I love the way he competes and does what he needs to do to help the Jazz win games."
Thoughts on Joe Ingles?
"Quite possibly my favorite question (or maybe I should say opening statement lol). Appreciate you for noticing. A lot of time spent with Chris Quinn, Eric/Bill Foran and our training staff has been whats helped the most. Favorite defender to watch is Joe Ingles. Really good at using his body/positioning and has quick hands."
Unfair advantage for Joe Ingles
"Yeah I was nice just talking about the Melo part. Trapping Rubio out of pnr and rotating off Joe Ingles in the corner while Utah was playing with a total non shooter (Favors) or a guy you're 100% happy to see shoot (Crowder) was mind blowing.  Yeah Melo was unplayable, yeah PG was inconsistent, yeah Russ lost his mind, but Donovan was maybe the worst of them all"
Joe Ingles would agree with you
Joe Ingles was out.
"*The Jazz Bench*: Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Derrick ""Playing For"" Favors, Jordan Fucking Clarkson, J.F. Clarkson, Jordan F. Clarkson, The Second Coming of Jordan, Clarkson."
That Joe Ingles fan page on Instagram in shambles rn
First game without Joe Ingles since five seasons ago
"This just doesn't feel right, the Jazz aren't the Jazz with out Jinglin' Joe Ingles"
"Does this sound like a lottery team to you?  Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles, Ricky Rubio, Jae Crowder, Dante Exum, Derrick Favors, Rodney Hood, Joe Johnson.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/2018.html)"
"1. “Named himself Playoff P then proceeded to get embarassed by Joe Ingles and rookie D Mitch  2. “Thats a bad shot” after getting eliminated by Dame  3. “We’re in the drivers seat” after games 5,6 against the Nuggets"
"I was born in 94 but am an Aussie so got into ball later and always find it strange when so many people in their early 20s discuss MJ, Russell, Bird etc. It’s too hard to rate something from the past in nba when people rate Lebron differently after every game. Getting an opinion from a few YouTube highlights. Anyway Joe Ingles is the goat."
Joe Ingles and Derrick Favors
Joe Ingles and Derrick Favors
joe ingles was in my house yesterday night he was sitting on my dads lazy boy fully reclined eating the cookies with milk left out for santa he was watching shrek 3 because apparently “it’s the best one mate” after i told him to get the fuck out of my house he got up slowly brushed the crumbs onto my moms fucking carpet did the finger guns with both hands and said “you’ve been jingled” before walking out of my front door
"to be fair ive only watched 1 game of his (this year so far), when he played the jazz and shot 6/22 and -12+-  we do have joe ingles on the team though, so its not really fair for paul"
Losing to Joe Ingles when you have Westbrook and PG is a huge upset.
"Not really, if Donovan has a bad night, there's nobody else who can pick up the tab. Any ""contending"" team needs another player like that, and it's not Mike Conley or Joe Ingles. Good depth, but look how well that served Utah in the Denver series."
"Nah a lot of us think he’s overrated because he gets absolutely shut down by guys like Joe Ingles in important playoff games. He’s amazing in the regular season, but he becomes an incredibly average player on a Max contract in the playoffs when people actually get in his face."
"Woah, his dad's name is not Paul, it's Joe Ingles."
"I absolutely know I’m biased but there are a lot of reasons to be. Mike Conley is starting off the season playing the way he ended last season (aka really good). Donovan has started this season a little slow but if the playoffs are anything to go off of we have nothing to worry about with him. Bogdanovic (our second top scorer last season) is back after missing the bubble with a wrist surgery. We have a 2 time DPOY with Rudy Gobert, plus Derrick Favors returning fills a massive hole in our roster when Rudy is off the court. Plus we have Jordan Clarkson who has been a walking bucket, and Joe Ingles who pairs really well at the PnR with Favors. Really just have a really solid team and our roster basically only improved since last season."
"He doesn't get criticized for losing, he gets criticized for running his mouth.  Dubbing himself playoff P and then getting punked by Joe Ingles does that   Chirping at Dame and then having Dame send him home on an iconic, series-winning walk off shot does that  There's a few more examples, but its 1:24 am and I dont feel like going that deep"
Joe Ingles exposed his weakness lmao.
Bet. Until he sees Joe Ingles in the PO that might be the case
"so now you're moving the goalposts. you went from saying he had a bad series to he had a bad game. he averaged 25ppg, i'm not sure how you can say that's having a horrible series. every player has bad games, and joe ingles had nothing to do with that. unless getting hacked in the paint by two defenders with gobert in front of you while getting no whistle is getting ""jingled"". not pg's fault he had to stand there and watch russ jack up shot after shot"
Dude changed his flare to joe ingles to type this
"I think most people felt bad for PG when he had his injury, then forced the trade to OKC and he named himself Playoff P and laid an egg against Joe Ingles and it became pretty easy to hate on him."
Joe Ingles v Playoff P again. Who says no.
"Derrick Favors, Joe Ingles, and Mike Conley. All certified Clipper killers."
No worries. Jazz are 3-1 against the Clippers since they picked up Joe Ingles' son.
It’s not his fault Joe Ingles is his dad.
Yeah but Joe Ingles son is playing for you guys now so it's still personal unfortunately.
Joe Ingles goes in... Paul George goes out...  Coincidence?
Quick say Joe Ingles is on the Jazz
Australian?  Two words : Joe Ingles
Basically Joe Ingles then.
Joe Ingles or Thaddeus Young should win it but Jordan Clarkson probably will because voters are brain dead and only care about scoring. You might as well have a bunch of Twitter morons vote for SMOTY at this point.
Well now Joe Ingles is at 48.7.
"who can say, joe ingles may overtake him"
joe ingles is an overrated youngster
"Tbf Joe is at 6.6 attempts which is an entire attempt more than Ingles, so that matters."
"I wonder why it’s “6+ attempts per game?”  *does a quick search*  Oh, it’s probably because Joe Ingles shoots 5.5 and has a 3pt% of 49.1."
Joe Ingles at 49.1% but only shooting 5.5 attempts a game
Clearly Joe Ingles.
The real question is why isn't Joe Ingles the runaway favorite for 6MOY.
Joe ingles is a starter.
The real 6moty is Joe Ingles.  Neither of those guys should even be in the conversation.
"Joe Ingles is very underrated in this aspect. Look at him. He looks like he should be teaching accounting at your local community college.  His BBIQ and his Shooting is how he's become a key rotation piece on the best team (record wise) in the NBA.   I think he very well may be one of the best passers in the league. He is probably the best PnR ball handler the league has as well.   I wouldn't necessarily put him top 5, but its hard to fill out a top 10-15 without bringing up Joe."
"Joe Ingles' TS% is 73 on the season, just ridiculous."
PG - Joe Ingles  SG - Donovan Mitchell  SF - Jae Crowder  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Rudy Gobert  Basically a worse version of the current Utah Jazz. We'd likely be a 4-6 seed in the West this season and lose in the first round to the Lakers.
"All of this, just to beat the god Joe Ingles"
Joe Ingles statue incoming
Ur telling me Joe Ingles isn’t a b-ball legends name?
Joe Ingles?
Any answer expect Joe Ingles will not be taken seriously. He would be amazing on tv
"So what’s the cut off to be considered elite?   Joe Ingles takes 5.5 3’s a game, shooting 50%. If he isn’t elite, no one on planet earth is."
KD was great and all but TS% isn’t the end all he all. PG averaged a good TS% in OKC that didn’t stop him from going 4/17 in an elimination game that he was guarded by Joe Ingles.
Joe ingles
"Psh. Joe Ingles is a superstar.  I mean, just look at that guy.  He’s an athletic marvel."
"You wouldn't say that to Joe Ingles face, he's jacked."
"Positionless basketball though.  Finding talent on the wings is definitely the hardest but I can't specify a single position.  Consider the top ten point guards and compare them to the top ten SGs or SFs and you'll start matching up dudes like Joe Ingles and Kelly Oubre with Jrue Holiday and Trae Young.  Then look at the big men who got bought out.  The wing is the hardest place to find talent for sure, what position you call it is up to you."
Joe Ingles
5/5 so maybe its not him....maybe its PG who just didnt bother showing up for the whole playoffs and let joe ingles get to him
Joe ingles.
Runner up will be Joe Ingles.
You mean the most complete player NOT named Joe Ingles? Maybe. . .
Sure idc Larry Bird would be Joe Ingles at best in today's NBA anyway  KD's rings are still meaningless either way
I’m a single issue voter and I won’t stop campaigning until color commentators are replaced with Joe Ingles being mic’d up during the game.
"""I'M 33!!I'M 33!!!STOP THROWING THE BALL"" - Joe Ingles"
That’s Joe “Most efficient player in nba history” Ingles of course they need that much talent
All that to beat Joe Ingles
All this to beat Joe Ingles.
"Joe Ingles makes exactly what he's worth to the Jazz - $13 million a year, will make $14 million next season. He's paid like a top end bench player, which he has been during his time with the Jazz. He also has started plenty of games during his time here with us."
I wanna see all of Joe Ingles 😋🤤
Have you seen Joe Ingles' mentality
"Joe Ingles isn’t a prospect though, he’s already a star"
It means that he was worse than Joe Ingles this year.
Joe ingles
"There’s a lot. Robert Covington, Royce O’neale, Alex Caruso, Joe Ingles, and Danuel house are other guys off the top of my head"
"There’s a lot. I’m pretty sure Robert Covington, Royce O’neale, Joe Ingles, Alex Caruso and Danuel House were all undrafted as well."
Paul George's legal custodian Joe Ingles
"In Australia our headlines are more dramatic ""Simmons leads his seventy sixers over Utah!  12p/5r/11a/3s from Ben willed the Sixers over the line. Matisse contributed heavily with stifling defensive efforts down the stretch.  Joe Ingles put up a fight for Utah, going 4/5 from beyond the arc.  ...   ...   Oh yeah and embiid goes for 50p/20r, may have contributed a liiiitle bit."""
1. Rudy Gobert  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Mike Conley  4. Joe Ingles  5. Jordan Clarkson  6. Bojan Bogdanovic  7. Royce O'neale  8. Georges Niang  9. Miye Oni  10. Matt Thomas or Ersan Ilyasova?

bruh put joe ingles #2 on 6moy  he knows
I got into Joe ingles because of the jazz but I'm a huge fan now
"I got into the Jazz because of Joe Ingles, but I am a huge fan now"
you know how every time you get crossed you get isekai'ed when joe ingles kuroko hang time duncan robinson double clutch jumpers?   they don't think it be anime references like how hang time plays but it do
joe ingles is the 3rd option that guy’s way too good
Because everyone is disrespecting Joe Ingles
Matt Thomas looks like a midget 20-year-old Joe Ingles with a nice tan
The nephews here are always sensitive to Japanese like asking not to relate everything to anime in Rui threads or when Yuta was posterized and not liking comments saying he had a whole episode of flashbacks when the fact of the matter is that every nba highlight is riddled with anime references like how hang time plays or double clutch jumpers or how Duncan Robinson or Joe Ingles do not bring the ball down while shooting is being related to Kuroko or how getting crossed gets you isekai-ed.  Your weeb hearts shouldn't be offended for getting exposed. Japanese references for a Japanese player especially is not disrespectful at all lmao.
PG got clamped by Joe Ingles when he was on the Thunder
All for Joe Ingles' FMVP to taste even sweeter
Joe Ingles begs to differ.
yeah but we have joe ingles
All this to beat Joe ingles and company in the finals smh my head
Wait for Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
"&gt;He was on record for not even wanting to be a Laker and it's contract year so yeah he has that kind of pull.  Not according to Vogel.  ""“I haven’t made any final decisions on that. It’s definitely something I want to look at,” Vogel told reporters on Wednesday, via Ryan Ward of Lakers Daily. See how he and LeBron look together sharing the ball-handling responsibilities.”  &gt;It's a fact that Marc is an all nba first team and DPOY no amount of your tears will change that  Riiight.  And the Knicks traded Smith and a second for the League MVP.  &gt;Because they wanted that 6MOY award and or they're more comfortable coming off the bench.  Riiight. That prestigious award that Schroder does not want.  In addition to being unaware of most of the facts here, consistency is an area that you are struggling in.  'Course, you didn't even know that he had not won it, until I told you.  So if I'm ""a casual"", and you know far less than I do, what does that make you?  &gt;Robert Covington and Joe Ingles come to mind, roco was cut at training camp by houston and Ingles by the clippers both quality players.  Both were cut before playing even 8 games, not after 100+ like Jones and McKinnie.  &gt;I mean it is correct since it's a fact that the Lakers are currently the deepest team in nba history  The Lakers are not even the deepest team currently playing out of the Staples Center.    And I already educated you on what a historically-deep NBA roster looks like, so your continued ignorance of that is, as you earlier put at, ""a very bad look"".  Try harder, you are embarrassing yourself."
Weird way to spell Joe Ingles
"He was on record for not even wanting to be a Laker and it's contract year so yeah he has that kind of pull.  It's a fact that Marc is an all nba first team and DPOY no amount of your tears will change that.   Because they wanted that 6MOY award and or they're more comfortable coming off the bench. It's pretty simple. Imagine being so dumb thinking a 6moy can't start, casuals' IQ are at an all time low.   Robert Covington and Joe Ingles come to mind, roco was cut at training camp by houston and Ingles by the clippers both quality players.  I mean it is correct since it's a fact that the Lakers are currently the deepest team in nba history, you disagreeing is just your wrong Delusional opinion."
Joe Ingles.
Joe Ingles is the heart and soul of the NBA
Joe Ingles. And. Joe Ingles.
"Clarkson was on Zach Lowe's podcast recently, and on it he confirmed that when he first arrived with the Jazz, he went up to Joe Ingles and said something like ""if you have the ball at the end of the shot clock and you don't have nothing, just give me the ball, I'll shoot it."""
"Kyle Lowry, Stephen Curry, Joe Ingles, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo.  League fucked."
PG: Jokic  SG : Joe Ingles  SF: Giannis  PF: Embiid  C: Robin Lopez  Coach: Richard Jefferson
Joe Ingles + Jordan Clarkson have combined for more points than the entire starting lineup. That's probably not going to cut it...
Random player to go off against us is Joe Ingles once again
Joe Ingles is a God
"Canada for sure, but Australia has had quite a few players come and go in the league.  Luc Longley on the MJ Bulls  Bogut Simmons  Patty Mills Joe Ingles Matthew Dellavadova Thon Maker  Aron Baynes  Shane Heal and Andrew Gaze are some Aussie basketball legends that managed to make it to the NBA in in the 90’s  Matisse Thybulle is American but I believe he is gunna play for Australia in the Olympics which is great cause he’s my favourite player."

"&gt; Larry Bird shot two 50/40/90 seasons when the NBA as a whole shot 3's 10% lower  &gt; literally there is no context to remove here. its clear cut. who makes more 3s on higher percentage?  He *literally* spelled it out for you and you still missed it. In those 50/40/90 seasons he mentioned, Bird shot 40.0% on 3.0 attempts when league average was 30.1% on 4.7 attempts, and he shot 41.4% on 3.1 attempts when league average was 31.6% on 5.0 attempts.  That's +10% relative to league average on 75% of the volume entire teams were taking, for a 150 game sample size. He was an even bigger outlier than Steph Curry.  &gt; bird never had more than 3.3 attempts per game while ingles is averaging 5+ attempts this year on a better percentage.  Imagine unironically using a 33 game sample size to claim that Joe Ingles is ""point blank"" the better 3 point shooter than Larry fucking Bird. Especially when Ingles is shattering his career highs in FG%, 2P%, 3P%, FT%, and TS% in that small sample size, aka he's likely going to regress to mean.  &gt; ive posted the numbers a hundred ways and restated the premise multiple times but if you just dont want to hear me, i cant do anything for you  LMAO. Staggering lack of self-awareness. That's 4 btw, not 100."
The disrespect to Joe Ingles.
Joe Ingles is intradeable
"Joe Ingles and then whoever, it doesn't matter."
It’s kind of funny he has that reputation now when a side by side comparison makes him look like a worse long range shooter than Joe Ingles. Obviously bird’s volume from 2 and the line make a difference but still a little counter intuitive lmao
Joe Ingles
"&gt;	The Jazz have the DPOY and damn near everyone on their team is a good defender.   Wrong. Mitchell, Clarkson, bojan, and Joe ingles aren’t good defenders."

"For this season, this entire sequence from the Jazz was pretty fun with the Bojan mid-air behind the back and the baseball pass to the spring-loaded Joe Ingles release.  Just the fact that there was a Bojan pass at all rates it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GctaBa24FGM"

"Great person to display some fun highlights, NBA Insta is about marketing, Kelly Oubre highlights will sell/appeal more than some Joe Ingles/ Lamarus Aldridge highlights"
"You mean besides Joe Ingles?  I don't think anyone else combines size, the ability to dominate at the rim with downhill speed, and Pete Marivich type playmaking into one package like that.  He's also elite at three point shooting and trash talking."

Thought you was talkin about Slow Mo Joe Ingles
"I'll go with current players.   1. Joe Ingles: Large part of Jazz's success. Great playmaker, defender, shooter.  2. Nikola Vucevic: Probably the 4th best Center behind Jokic, Embiid, Gobert. His current season is not being noticed with season averages of 24.6/11.6/3.7 including 40% from 3 and 85% from the line because his team is not doing well with 4 of their rotational players out for the year."
"If we’re talking about post up, fade away, push off inside hookshot moves then you need to take a look at Joe Ingles. His bag of tricks is deeper than Santa’s sack of toys."
Joe Ingles
They should have 4. Mike Conley has been an absolute beast since he’s come to town and Joe Ingles has been snubbed of an allstar appearance these last couple years.
Joe ingles for number 2?
1. Joe Ingles  And the rest is whatever
Joe Ingles snubbed
Joe Ingles
"No I think Jerami is better offensively than Horry was, and Horry was miles better than Jerami at defense. I’m on my phone but Horry averaged like 6 FA/game playing less than 30min a game whereas Grant has not been a defensive standout but is showing he can be relied on as a volume scorer taking 17 attempts/game this year. Bob never ever had that capability, as his strength was being a defensive anchor. You can’t build a team around that. It’s like building around Trevor Ariza as someone said below, or Joe Ingles. It’s a fair question!"

"Because the dude continuously refuses to back up his shit talking. He made the ""Playoff P"" comment right before getting sonned by Joe Ingles. He's like the republican version of trash talking..."
"Joe, and I cannot stress this enough, Ingles."
Is Joe Ingles a 90th Percentile Perimeter defender?
Joe Ingles was 27 when he came into the NBA and  he's twice as good as his first season at 31.  Robinson can definitely grow.
Nice to see Matt Thomas and Joe Ingles spending some quality father-son time together.
"Joe Harris was a 4 year college player who got drafted to a Cavs team that doesn't play rookies, then got hurt and the magic were dumb enough to cut him.   He was good straight away with the Nets, which was the first time he got real minutes in the NBA. Then took another leap after a few years to become the elite shooter he is now. Joe ingles obviously wasn't in the NBA at all as you said, and contributed as a role player pretty quickly after arriving.  I think fans hope the late bloomer thing will happen to guys who are in the league for 5 years, playing relatively consistent minutes and suck, Harris and Ingles are not an examples of that. It almost never happens that way."
If they hadn't cut Joe Ingles they have a real shot at a title.
joe ingles didn't even make the league till 27 and didn't have a breakout year till 30. joe harris didn't have a breakout season till 27

Joe Ingles kinda looks like Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys
Joe Ingles = Toby Flenderson
Kind of hard to believe fact about Todd Fuller: He was briefly a teammate of a teenage rookie Joe Ingles in Australia and Mark Price was the coach (also very briefly)!
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles has a pretty quick release on catch and shoot 3s too
No way.  It will forever and always be Joe Ingles.  Why do we even have these threads??
"Unless the Suns play the Jazz like they don’t matter with our injuries currently, y’all will be 1st seed tomorrow and into the foreseeable future. We might not have Conley for a couple of games and I hope the organization doesn’t try to rush Mitchell either. Right now we’re relying heavily on bench players and third stringers, which isn’t too bad when you have a GOAT like Joe Ingles, but still lol."
Joe Ingles is gonna be on the top of the JINGLE stats
Guess Joe Ingles is the MVP then.
"Hey do people call Joe Ingles Jingles? Because if they don't, they should definitely call him Jingles."
You're right. Joe Ingles should be the MVP
"*To be fair*, MPJr in this stretch has had way more volume than Joe Harris or Ingles (again, 21PPG on 69%TS the past 35 games, 25PPG past 10 games), and SGA doesn't have Curry's volume OR efficiency..  If you put it that way, Curry vs Ingles, then my post looks dumb af haha"
"Like being a spot up shooter is a skill, but it’s like comparing curry vs Joe Harris or Joe ingles lol obviously the guy scoring efficiently off the dribble is much more impressive than the guy sniping off of assist"
"This is neat and all, but can we really trust a system that doesn't put Joe Ingles at #1 for every year he's played?"
"Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum, Doc Rivers, Austin Rivers, Enes Kanter"
"No order: Joe Harris, Clint Capela, Joe Ingles, PJ Tucker  Number five I'm not sure of yet."

Everything Joe Ingles does is effortless.
Joe Harris  Joe Ingles  Royce O'Neale  Robert Covington  Bobby Portis
"Raptor is a hybrid metric including both box score complexes and APM, which, yes, is based on box plus-minus. I never said it wasn't adjusted or altered, of course it is.  Context matters for RAPTOR. What 538 is interested in as a project is probabilities; with sports, their top priority is predicting game outcomes. So what RAPTOR really is at its core is the condition in a conditional probability matrix. What this means is that they are calculating PrA|C where A is Lakers beat the Magic and C is their relative RAPTOR ratings. All that is important here is its predictive ability - teams that win should have higher raptor totals, how they achieve those totals is irrelevant. AD could have his RAPTOR swapped with Kuzma and it wouldn't make a difference to the system's efficacy as a predictive tool.  This is the root of its problem as a rating for individuals. The success of a team must be distributed amongst the individual players; this is why all Jazz players rank strangely high. Important factors get lost in this: the strength of a coach is not evaluated, so their impact gets absorbed into the players. The increase in probablity that the Jazz wins by having Snyder as coach is distributed into Ingles, Clarkson, etc. Secondly, it does not evaluate the fit of the team together. A team may lose due to lacking complementary skillsets despite the genuine skill of its players. Thirdly, the raptors of worse teams must be deflated, so bad coaching/bad fit get absorbed by players. To predict the magic losing, you either had to siphon raptor from AG/Fournier or you had to cap Vucevic, or both. A cursoory glance at the player rankings shows the absurdity of using it for evaluating the skill of players/using it as a top player ranking. Joe Harris isn't better than Zion - the Nets are better than the Pelicans.  As someone who has had to study the foundations of probability systems too much, take my word: more complex formulas don't remove absurd results, they just make the absurdities more complex."
"Ultimately a lot of analysts will consider players in terms of what they bring to deep playoffs teams. There isn't much place for Russell Westbrook on one of those if you consider how defenses treat him in the playoffs and how much shooting you need to place around him for him to be effective.   So yes, he's better overall player than a Mikal Bridges or Joe Ingles. That goes without saying. But what does it actually mean in the long run? We should be able to distinguish between a player's box scores/first-order impact and their fit/flexibility/second-order impacts. Russ is incredible at the first but quite low on the second. I think Nate Duncan considers the second to be way more important when ranking players"
The clippers /s  Funny the lob city clippers desperately needed a wing shooter and they let cut Joe ingles
"Joe Harris, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green"
"Is there a team in the league that would *not* want a Joe Ingles on their team? Seriously, I’d love to see what roster is so stacked that they can look at Joe Ingles and say “Nah, we’re good.”"
If Joe Ingles isn't on your list your list is wrong.
"What’s your definition of a role player? If it’s just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who’s just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don’t require super high usage."
Honestly the first person that came to mind was Joe Ingles lol the guy could literally do anything you ask of him and I don’t even like the Jazz personally
Joe Ingles.
I mean Utah has Joe Ingles on the floor
Joe Ingles is already at 19 games out of 56. So still higher than Lou from that season.
"I’d argue the 2013 &amp; 2014 Spurs and 2011 Mavs are closer to the most complete teams in recent NBA history.   Spurs had Parker, Ginobili, Green, Kawhi, Duncan, Diaw, Splitter, Patty and Cory Joseph. They had a lineup for every style and could defend against any team or lineup they came across.   The Mavs had Dirk, Kidd, Chandler, Terry, Peja, Stevenson, Marion, JJ, Brewer and Haywood. The only defensive weakness was Dirk but he was a superstar that year to the level that no one on the Spurs team I mentioned nor anyone on the Jazz are close. Other than that they could defend any superstar you threw at them with multiple defenders and they had 4 or 5 guys who could reliably create offense.   The Jazz’s weakness is that they can’t match any of the other contenders through sheer talent/star power. In the playoffs you eventually have to be able to match a KD, LeBron, Jokic, Kawhi, Steph level player down the stretch of 16 games. They also have no real hope of guarding a LeBron, KD, Harden, Kawhi, or Luka. Royce Oneal and Joe Ingles are not carrying you through 4 rounds against that competition."
Joe Ingles is shooting like 50% from 3.
"Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17 points on 15 shots with 41/34/92 shooting splits. Shot chuckers usually get the award, but I really don't think he deserves it. If it has to be the Jazz, I would rather give it to Joe Ingles."
Clarkson absolutely deserved it for the first half of the season but Joe has been hot on his tail all year and now that Clarkson has ahead a long stretch of less than stellar production it should go to Ingles.
Joe ingles
Joe ingles plays the game the white way such a shame he will lose to clarkson
"Joe Ingles should win over both of them, I'm shocked Bobby Portis isn't getting more buzz, and DRose should get votes at least"
Joe Ingles? Why is Clarkson the candidate over Ingles
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
"You need Jazz basketball in your life sir. A beautiful utopia that only a serial killer like coach Snyder could make a reality, where both Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson can coexist and thrive!"
Joe Ingles? LaMelo Ball? Patty Mills? Stephen Jackson?  Honestly this take is so incredibly weak.
"Kobe and Durant (sadly). Durant would beat Bird 100-0 in a 1v1 game, dude was just Joe Ingles with short shorts"
Larry Bird would be a slightly better Joe Ingles in today's NBA so him
I’m also just going to put out that I think Joe Ingles would be hilarious and fit in perfectly
"If you take into account volume, curry sits right at 3 SDs above the mean in terms of ""fantasy impact on 3pt%"" I guess you would call it.  Joe Harris is the league leader at 4.34 SDs above the mean and Joe Ingles second at 3.50 SDs above the mean. Curry sits third.  Harris and Ingles shoot nearly 50% from 3, curry sits at 42.7% on twice the volume however."
"Joe Ingles, he and Mitchell seem to share the backup PG duties when Conley sits."
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
Joe Ingles because hes on track to set the all time highest single season true shooting %
Joe Ingles will break this record in 2 October games next season
After Joe Ingles? LeBron maybe?
I always wonder how Steph would shoot if he only took the shots that like Joe Harris or Joe Ingles take. 60%???
This is one of the hardest teams to try and reconstruct because they weren’t superstars but they fit really well  Chauncey Billups- Kyle Lowry  Rip Hamilton- Joe Ingles  Tayshaun Prince- Talen Horton-Tucker   Rasheed Wallace- Michael Porter Jr.   Ben Wallace- Clint Capela   The team that I built isn’t as good on defense but is better offensively
"PG still having nightmares about Joe Ingles and the Playoff series against the Jaz. Crazy that Donovan Mitchell was a rookie and led the Jazz to a 4-2 victory over Russ, PG, and Melo."
"If you think founier, rob williams, Tristan thompson is near jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, favors, niang, oni I suggest you watch more basketball outside of the Cs..  Rob williams is a very solid bench player. The others are eh"
Should be Joe Ingles imo.
He’s [actually throughout his career consistently been joe Ingles in the month of February and a mediocre 3 point shooter every other month of the season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/balllo01/splits/). It’s been a weird trend that’s held up for 4 years

Joe Ingles. Law of averages
In no world is either Joe Ingles or CJ the 151 best player
CJ Mcollum and Joe Ingles
Clearly it's Joe Ingles
If Joe Ingles is both the GOAT and a role player then he’s definitely the GOAT role player.
Joe the GOAT Ingles

Have her watch Joe Ingles play. She'll know deep within her loins that he is what an ideal NBA player looks and plays like.

"Joe Ingles. Guy willingly goes to the bench while he has 3 teammates making the all-star game, his other teammate for some reason is considered for 6MOTY despite him having better stats and he doesn't complain at all"
Joe Ingles
"Who cares about 17 starts? Ingles is the best 6th man and its not even close in my eyes. Better player than Clarkson and he is more valuable to the Utah team in terms of playmaking and defense. Also unreal shooting splits making him one of the best in that field as well. I hate when 6th man gets his award based just on scoring. Joe shoots better, defends better and he is a better playmaker than  Clarkson. Scoring isnt everything, if Joe was taking as many shots as he does, he would easily have same amount of points even if we factor in the fact his splits would drop a bit.  Joe for the win. Lets basketball wins for a change. Real basketball skills. Teamwork. IQ. Taking good shots. Making teammates better. Cmmon lets make it happen. He truly deserves it."
Hey dummy we have Joe Ingles
There’s not a single team that wouldn’t want joe ingles. Every team wants a highly effective role player.
i would hate to have joe ingles on my team. he's trash. frankly i doubt there's anybody (besides jazz fans) who would want a guy with 73 ts% on their team
joe ingles is getting a statue outside of the viv so hands off
i don’t think about joe ingles enough to feel strongly either way
"There was one from game 2 Grizz-Jazz the other day which was laughable. I think it was Dillion Brooks flew by Ingles on a close out and and stuck his ass out on the way, hitting Joe in the face, in the first quarter too."
Jordon Clarkson or Joe Ingles
Just have to insert that Joe Ingles is PGs daddy.
joe ingles

"Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Pat Bev, and Serge Ibaka are also smart/disciplined defenders and Luka’s still averaging 35/9/9.  He’s a generational talent and you will see why. If you think Royce O’Neal and Joe Ingles are going to contain him then you’re in for a long series."
I would go up against Joe Ingles. But his trash talking would probably leave me in tears in the fetal position.

Does that make Joe Ingles the best 7th man ever
Joe Ingles’ fake pass on the pick and roll. People look so dumb when they fall for it
"Jazz have a few undrafted legends on their squad in Royce Oneal and Joe Ingles. Sixth man of the year Jordan Clarkson was also a second round pick. Of those 3 only Royce was originally signed/drafted by the Jazz. Bojan Bogdanovic was also the first pick of the second round, also not drafted by Utah."
Joe Ingles is Australian fyi
I mean that depends on position joe ingles is 6’8” and Clarkson is 6’4”. They fill pretty different roles on the lineup
I been mixing up joe harris and Joe ingles as long as they've been around
Have you kept up with things since then? Every SLPD officer was required to attend a training on [Sensory Inclusive Training](https://www.google.com/amp/s/kutv.com/amp/news/local/slc-police-partner-with-jazz-player-joe-ingles-for-sensory-inclusion-training)  Also I believe Utah just passed a bill that will require every officer in the state to have the training.
"I mean, we all already know that Joe Ingles is the GOAT."
Joe Ingles: the car mechanic who can drain 3's
"Glad Clarkson won, but this being even hotly debatable goes to show how people view the game differently nowadays (almost purely about stats), or they just don't watch Jazz games.  Joe is more valuable to complete that Jazz team, yes, like a glue guy, but he's not a traditional 6th man in a sense that if your team gets dry on offense, put Joe in and you'll turn the tides. He's more like a system player, making Ingles a 5b-position guy if you will instead of a 6-position player, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Clarkson on the other hand..his value to the Jazz (and that particular team alone) is understated. He is so valuable to that team that the moment things are not working particularly for the Jazz (which is very often especially pre-Clarkson trade when their bench is trash), like 3pt shot not working or no other teammate step up to take the shots, Clarkson is their go-to guy. Like garbage shot clock? He's there for you, and he works more often than not. It's not pretty sometimes, but when times get tough, just call him, and he made it work by winning basically (Jazz is #1 in regular season duh).  I think the TL;DR of this is that for the Jazz, Ingles is the best 5th guy complementary piece to the team; Clarkson is the bail-out basically, like the 6th player when you can't make it work with any 5 players you put (and that includes Joe). That's why he's more of a traditional 6th man more than anything, and he deserved to win 6MOTY."

That's why he's more of a traditional 6th man more than anything, beyond those PPG numbers."
I don't disagree but I think Joe Ingles deserves it too
"6MOTY really needs a redefinition, right now it's based on the ""best performing"" player coming off the bench. Joe Ingles has been way more impactful than JC, it's not even close and Thad Young who was probably the best player off the bench during the season didn't even get any recognition.   &amp;#x200B;  I guess after Iggy didn't get any respect for that 73 win season, this award became hopeless."
"&gt; I mean the numbers other than PPG don't bear out him having more impact than Joe.  Oh, I agree.  But frankly the metrics I'm aware of don't really capture roles and how replaceable those roles are given who else is on the roster.    And on this Jazz roster I'd absolutely argue that JC at least as valuable, if not moreso, as Ingles.    &gt;You can dig into lineup data and look at like for like lineups and find that the ones with Ingles are better because the ball flows better and the assist rate for the team spikes like crazy.  Sure, but like I said, we basically had stretches where Joe was called upon to lead the 2nd units last year, and the offense just wasn't there.  JC solved that.  Our best 2nd units are probably those where both men are playing, frankly, but w/o JC the firepower simply isn't there.    &gt;You're basically saying ""PPG is overvalued, but we gotta give it to Clarkson because of his PPG""  No.  I'm saying PPG is overvalued, but PPG is legitimately something that has to be considered regardless.  If anything, you're massively undervaluing PPG."
"I mean the numbers other than PPG don't bear out him having more impact than Joe.  Clarkson had a negative on/off. Ingles was extremely positive. Advanced stats prefer Ingles. You can dig into lineup data and look at like for like lineups and find that the ones with Ingles are better because the ball flows better and the assist rate for the team spikes like crazy.   You're basically saying ""PPG is overvalued, but we gotta give it to Clarkson because of his PPG"""
Well if Joe Ingles can start for much of the season and that’s the only argument against him and the guy who made the comment says that Joe’s more valuable is pretty much saying that as long as he’s more valuable he should be in the conversation meaning LeBron could be 6MOTY because he’s valuable.
"Ernie: ""How many Silver awards has u/Prussian-Troll gotten today?""    u/Prussian-Troll: ""Uhh... 0?""      Joe Ingles: *holds up a finger* ""One."""
"I get what you're saying, but tbf getting buckets off the bench is also immensely valuable to a team.  Clarkson has literally carried the bench offense for Utah in stretches this season, and bench scoring was one of our biggest weaknesses before we traded for the dude last year.    I do think PPG gets overvalued in awards like this, but in Utah's case specifically I'd actually argue he's had more impact than Joe (despite the latter being more flexible).  We've tried having Ingles anchor the bench unit's offense, and it just didn't work last year."
Everyone needs more Joe Ingles in their life
It’s that coke from Joe ingles homeland. It’ll get ya little loose.
I refuse all awards unless they’re presented by Joe Ingles... except on Reddit of course.
Get you a friend like Joe Ingles.  Very wholesome moment for sure.
"You should show the whole setup.   For those who didn't see it, the crew asked Ingles and Clarkson a series of 3 questions about 6th man history. The last question was ""How many Jazz players have won the 6th man award?""  Jordan hesitantly says ""Zero"" and Ingles says ""One"".  Ernie asks Joe, ""Okay, who's the one?""  Joe says, ""Jordan Clarkson"" and passes him the trophy."
Joe Ingles
Clarkson seemed genuinely surprised and humbled there. What a nice moment even though I think Joe Ingles had a better statistical case for the award.
That was way cool! Really was a great surprise. Was not expecting that. Joe Ingles deserves an Oscar.
"That was a great reveal. How Joe Ingles answered ""one [player for utah won]"" and gave him the award"
Joe Ingles setting Chuck straight about the segment was the best part. Dude's got a future as a sports anchor!
nice surprise by Joe Ingles on TNT :)
Joe Ingles has a career in TV after basketball
I wish I had a friend like Joe Ingles man
Joe Ingles honestly deserved it more
Joe Ingles honestly deserved it more
"“He was almost that glue guy off the court for us,” Joe Ingles said. “I wish I went to one more massage that I didn’t go to...I guess I’m very grateful that I got seven years with him and some hilarious times and sad times.”"
"Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles actually both do some similar stuff, but in the half court"
"You telling me the same team w/ Joe Ingles, [a mf who ain't even know what TS% is](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n5gyo5/macmahon_joe_ingles_has_fing_no_idea_what_true/), has players who care about RAPTOR??? DRPM?!?!  LMAO"
Why lol Joe Ingles dicking Playoff P is already a foregone conclusion
"“He was almost that glue guy off the court for us,” Joe Ingles said. “I wish I went to one more massage that I didn’t go to...I guess I’m very grateful that I got seven years with him and some hilarious times and sad times.”"
" “He was almost that glue guy off the court for us,” Joe Ingles said. “I wish I went to one more massage that I didn’t go to...I guess I’m very grateful that I got seven years with him and some hilarious times and sad times.”"
Lmao joe ingles at the end
Joe was sick of Brooks and the grizzlies from the beginning. If you watch joe ingles after he inbounds the ball for the jazz’s very first possession. You’ll laugh at how he gets through 3 defenders to get to his spot for the 3.
"&gt; Dougie Fresh  “He was almost that glue guy off the court for us,” Joe Ingles said. “I wish I went to one more massage that I didn’t go to...I guess I’m very grateful that I got seven years with him and some hilarious times and sad times.”      “He was almost that glue guy off the court for us,” Joe Ingles said. “I wish I went to one more massage that I didn’t go to...I guess I’m very grateful that I got seven years with him and some hilarious times and sad times.”"
But Ingles is already called Slow Mo Joe
Brooks is going to die when Joe Ingles paints a tunnel on the stanchion
No wonder brooks is mad he gotta play against Joe Ingles
"Don't forget uhh them classy players like Caruso, Boban, Joe Ingles...qwhite the bunch huh?"
90 point game from Joe Ingles incoming.
"Ever since Joe Ingles in that playoff series... well, I'd be bitter too if I got jingled that badly."
"I don't even like Harden, but it is reeeeeeeeally interesting how reddit is constantly excusing Jokic's horrible defense compared to how this sub shredded Harden in the mid '10s in almost the exact same situation.  r/NBA continues its nonstop unsolicited MVP campaign for the delightfully relatable chubby white Jokic for MVP.   Sponsored by the weekly suburban lawn care trimming dad hires, and presented by Trader Joe's avocados on multigrain toast.   Alex Caruso Joe Ingles TJ McConnell"
"Joe Ingles, Nicola Jokic, Luka Doncic. Dude has a type."
"I wanna see a guy like Embiid or Jokic with a super-shooting team, just for kicks. Not even for like an official game, just an exhibition match for the spectacle. Like, a line-up of Steph Curry/Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Joe Ingles/Embiid or Jokic. Steph isn't allowed to do Steph things, purely just a dominant post-up threat down low and the four best catch-and-shoot shooters* in the league surrounding him.  Like the Finals-run Dwight Howard Magic on steroids.  *I don't know who statistically the four best catch-and-shooters are this year, but I think that's a pretty solid guess at the actual top four, right?"
Joe Ingles is actually PG's father.
False he called himself playoff p the year before that in the Jazz series. Then Joe Ingles rocked his world
"Joe isn't a ""master of none"", he's one of the best PnR ball handlers in the league, a great playmaker, excellent defender, and among league leaders in 3p% on pretty substantial volume.   Clarkson is attempting almost 9 3PAs per game, Ingles is attempting a touch over 6. Ingles is getting around 8.3ppg off of his threes. Clarkson, with *three more attempts a night* is averaging only about 9.2 points from threes each game. Clarkson is on average shooting close to twice as much as Ingles is but only averaging six more points.   Clarkson is a very valuable sparkplug off the bench, but to compare him to Mitchell's role is just not reasonable. They're both talented isolation scorers, but Mitchell is a substantially better shooter, he's more talented at relocating off the ball, and he's a much more gifted playmaker, not to mention the fact that he can play above the rim as well. While you're correct to say that Mitchell is often the focal point of the opposing defense, Clarkson very rarely is. Usually the focal point of the defense when Clarkson and Ingles share the floor is Mike Conley, because those two are part of the Jazz bench lineup of death that includes Mike, Rudy, and Niang. In fact, that's the Jazz' second most played lineup.   In that lineup, Clarkson gets a lot of shots only because he's a convenient guy to dump the ball off to when a play falls apart, but his shot is dramatically worse in terms of efficiency or quality than the shots that *any other guy on the floor* will be taking. Mike is more efficient from just about everywhere on the floor, Joe is better in the PnR and behind the arc, and Niang is a really gifted 3p% guy as well. Obviously Rudy is insanely efficient as a lob threat and roll man too, so they'd rather run that kind of a play instead. Joe is a *huge* part of why that lineup works so well - if you can force the ball out of Mike's hands, it goes to a guy who is *just as good of a playmaker* as the starting pointguard, and is still an incredibly lethal scorer.   Clarkson is an important guy, obviously, and he serves a valuable function, but to claim that he is the focal point of the team's offense is ludacris when you realize that in the most common lineup he plays in, an isolation is *at best* the fifth option after a lob to Rudy, catch-and-shoot attempts by any of the three other shooters on the floor, a pick-and-roll, or a Conley isolation. If the ball ever touches Clarkson's hands, and it's not an immediate catch-and-shoot situation, that is a sign that the play has failed, and that they need to put it in the hands of the guy who is the best at making inefficient shots. He does not make his teammates better, and he is not the catalyst for what transformed our bench unit to be as effective as it has been this season. Those factors were Conley and Ingles."
"Ha is fantastic and definitely has some moxy to his game. That said, he’s a terrible 3 point shooter (~30% this season) and almost cost the Griz the game with all his bricks he put up, big late game shot aside. For him to be considered a superstar, he either needs to work on that shot until he has the shooting skills of our Lord, Joe Ingles, or he needs to stay within his game and dominate the lanes."
"Yeah, I was reading the same stats, Im just talking about March -you cant call it ass if Clarkson +/- avg is up, with almost 16PPG vs Ingles best avg this season 13pts?? with Joe's several bad games that got him a 0 points and several 3 or below 5 points and low assists for an avg playing time of 25mins, Yeah, so much for ""Super easy to access"" lmao.      Honestly, Joe plays well with dynamic players like Mitchell and Clarkson,  these dynamic players get doubled team and break defenses that give spacing so shooters like Joe can take open shots, that's what I call the true impact.     You have to think why this year is Ingles best year? because he started playing with Mitchell and Clarkson, that is what I call ""simple as that"". Sorry, I will no longer entertain this thread since your stat referencing was inaccurate.  Peace out"
He's a beautiful young man: Joe Ingles probably
Apologize to Joe Ingles
"Generally speaking Redditors love certain categories of players.  1. Volume shooter with good TS - Curry, Dame, Beal, Lavine   2. 3 point specialist with high consistency - Ingles, Joe Harris, Clarkson, Seth Curry   3. Lots of blocks and steal - Myles Turner, Thybulle   4. 3 &amp; D specialists - Covington, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  Sometimes they go out of fashion but based on what I have seen here, it is generally true.  Players with 'clutch' reputation also have a lot of goodwill.   On the other hand, Triple double gang has polarized reputation."
"I’m sorry I just came here to vent.   Why are people bashing the Grizzlies/ Jazz series?   Will it be a sweep? Probably, Probably not.   But I feel this is much better than whatever we would’ve gotten with the Warriors.   This is the same shit that got Steph that damn MVP nod. (I know he had a god like year) but the fans are like “no ones watching Jazz/Grizzlies”   yea it doesn’t have a true superstar in it. But still bro it’s basketball stop bitching about the series if you aren’t gonna watch it. I wanna see Valanciunas vs Gobert , Mike Conley going back to Memphis. Kyle Anderson vs Joe ingles.   TF? What’s all this complaining about?   I hate this meat riding ass league and it’s fans sometimes man damn"
"Don’t worry all you steph lovers, the goat joe ingles is still in the playoffs!!"
Josh Green or Joe Ingles.
"I really hope he ends up being a good valuable role player for a few years like joe ingles. Joe came into the league late, albeit at 27 not 30. But has developed into a huge piece for us"
Sounds like the Joe Ingles one I see on Instagram every once in a while when I make the mistake and check comments.
"LMAO at that top 5 list, lemme fix it for you pal  Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, Joe L Embiid, Jo Bamba, and Poku"
"clarkson is scoring about six points off the bench more than ingles on eight more shot attempts a night more or less. ingles is much better at manufacturing efficient offense too; he's one of the best pick&amp;roll ball handlers in the nba and is a lot more capable of running things as a primary or secondary point. there's a reason we had joe running the 1 when mitchell and conley were out and why we would sometimes close with him on the floor but almost never with clarkson. clarkson is a decent guy to have sitting in the corner, and he's great at manufacturing offense to let the other guys take a few plays off and recover while he scores in isolation.   joe is better at basically everything else you could ask a modern nba player to do. he can defend four positions, spot up, create a little off the dribble, run half court offense, drive to the basket, you name it and it's a skill he has and is at least very good hut in some cases is genuinely elite and among the best the nba has to offer.  Clarkson is a better isolation scorer. Joe is the far superior player."
5 Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles has left the chat
"Lol look at my flair. I’m not saying it as a casual fan. I am fine with joe getting it, and in fact think he deserves it more because, to me, the 6th man is the “next guy up”, and joe has shown to be perfect for that with Conley and Mitchell’s time out this season.  However, typically the 6MOTY goes to the highest scorer off the bench. And that’s clarkson. So to say he doesn’t deserve it is just not a great take (even though I agree with it). Ingles started 30 games this year, that’s 41% of games. So he is really on the border of “starter” and “bench” player. (But again, I think 6MOTY should go to the “next man up”, just in recent history that hasn’t been the case)"
He saw Joe Ingles waiting in the finals and he shidded and farded

It happened to Joe Ingles earlier this year.  They said he flopped on replay so they gave him a tech.

Playoff P's entire existence is designed to get JINGLED in the playoffs by Joe Ingles
ok hold on are they really selling out on joe fucking ingles? hello?
Joe Ingles is what PG think he is
Everyone on the Jazz not named Joe Ingles playing like pure garbage on the offensive end. Yikes. Donovan is getting locked up too. Jazz have no chance in the series if Kawhi stays on Donovan. Conley better get his ass back.
THE CLIPPERS CUT JOE INGLES
So this is the Joe Ingles game

"I'm Jazz fan from Turkey since 2017 and I haven't had any regret about it, we are currently the best team in the league, we have a great history and we have Joe Ingles, one of the best players that ever walked on Earth, there's a downside of being a Jazz too, someone will call you a racist because you are a jazz."
Anthony Edwards (Ego) Joe Ingles (Aussie Dad) Stephen Adams (NZ/Teddy Bear) Giannis Antetokounmpo (Sincerity) Donovan Mitchell (Smile)
Joe Ingles gunna have Paul George in HELL
I'm going jazz this one. Donovan Mitchell playing like he should be the MVP. Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson both 6th men of the league. Rudy Gobert the DPOY. I don't see clips taking this one. They just don't have enough manpower to stop Mitchell and company.

Just having Joe Ingles makes them special ❤️
Donovan Mitchell  Mike Conley  Rudy Gobert Joe Ingles  That's 4  Bojan Bogdanovich is borderline.
"1. Nikola Jokic 2. Derrick Rose 3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis 5. Joe Ingles         Joker is fresh on my mind after the game but I tried to avoid putting on the really really young guys like Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker excetera, as far as Joe Ingles I like the what can I say lol"
"Somebody askewd for my reasons, so here it is:   &amp;#x200B;  1. Derrick Rose - His pure love and respect of the game is just visible.  2. Chris Paul - It's the only thing that's missing in his HOF career.   3. Seth Curry - He's worked hard and made his own path. Same the Gasols for me.  4. Joe Ingles - He's quite a character, foreign impact, a sportsman.  5. Jordan Clarkson - He's an inspiration to aspiring Filipinos (A little bias cause I am), and him embracing the second squad roles is something young guys can learn from."
"Yeah, no shit. You also just contradicted yourself twice. Since Jokic is playing a tougher opponent his fg% should be lower than Embiids, yet youre slandering Jokic by saying embiid has been more efficient? You’re saying embiid has no help offensively yet his teammates are putting up number because his opponents are so bad? If you’re just gonna say a player is good based solely by there TS%, then joe ingles is a top 10 player in the league. Watch the easy buckets monte, jamychal and Mpj have all bricked this series. If everyone was the same regular season to post season, Giannis should be a back to back champion. But he’s not because the playoffs are completely different. The fact of the matter is that you have yet to counter that embiid has had ample help around him on both sides of the ball, facing inferior competition, and not missing his second best player. The suns are daring anyone on the nuggets roster to make a bucket and no one this series has. Embiids 2nd, 3rd and 4th best teammates have all markedly been better in the playoffs, and have 100% added more help than anyone on the nuggets this series. So again, i ask how does embiid have similar or less help than Jokic. Because his players came to play and jokic’s teammates have all been collectively worse"
Not sure if I should go for suns or jazz  Suns: Beat the Lakers if they become champions losing would not be bad.  Jazz: They got Donovan Mitchell who is super like able. Also Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles is the greatest player of all time

"Most perimeter stars of the 90's and 00's will be more effective today provided they are able to shoot three pointers off the dribble at around league avg.  The reason is simple.  Increase spacing and the advent of switching defense to prevent the three point shot off the high screen.  Perimeter stars today are often isolated against the opposing teams weakest defender.  Often a center or a poor defender due to switches in screen coverage.  Allen Iverson would murder if he could isolate against the Kanter, Nurkic, Vuc, Jokic or Ingles, Trae, Harden, Joe Harris, etc as we so often see today."

"I'll give you Morris playing poorly, but Bev has been good on Defense and you should never need to rely on the like 6 points a game i'd expect him to get. Comparing ibaka to conley is a bad one, he's an upgrade on the starting unit and then you get Joe Ingles to feast on the bench"

"Ben Simmons, the poor man's Joe Ingles that can't shoot."
yep morris gambled that joe was going to bait him by rising up and pass to royce. faked like he was going to switch and went back to royce.   watching the position of the Clippers players here it seems like its definitely Jackson's fault. Maybe Beverly was supposed to get Ingles but he was clearly unaware and was totally out of position. Jackson should have realized it and picked up the ball carrier
"hey im not disagreeing!!! i love me some joe ingles. but if were being 100% real with ourselves, joe ingles doesnt do this shit on the kings. he benefits from being in a spot where he doesnt have to do too much on a night-to-night basis. if joe ingles goes 1-10 we prolly dont say shit, bad shooting night, whatever.

"No Serge Ibaka (Season ending back surgery)  Joe Ingles finishing 2nd beside (Jordan Clarkson) for 6th man of the year.

(To be fair the Clippers haven't done shit since it's entire existence as well)  But to go out and say I'm a Ignorant rebranded Lakers fan, when you can't even look at the other side of the argument and just go with  ""Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley is injured reason why we lost"" ""You're ignorant AF""  Get out of here with that weak petty shit.  &amp;#x200B;  Jazz fan have the same mentality as their roster.

"I agree with everything you're saying, for sure. But the comment I replied to implied that that's the only reason why people like Joe Ingles more than Paul George.

"As a Jazz fan, I'm fully here for the PG redemption arc.   Because the better PG looks, the more powerful our highlights of Joe Ingles shutting him down become."
I think it would be great if both Patty mills and Joe ingles could carry the Olympic flag out. Both are great sportsman and make me proud to be Australian.
"Caron Butler, Matt Barnes, Luc Mba Moute, Danny Granger, Reggie Bullock, Grant Hill, Paul Pierce, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson, Jeff Green, Wesley Johnson. Who was their missing piece in my opinion? Joe Ingles who they had and cut from the team without even touching the floor."
We got people in this sub comparing him to Joe fucking Ingles when we were down 0-2 in the Jazz Series.  Put respect on my man name.
OK maybe Trae wasn't the best example but I still feel like excessive or animated celebrations (ie westbrook) are a form of taunting  Also there was a play where Paul George attacked the basket and got fouled and Joe Ingles mocked him for what he thought was flopping. No tech and I'm OK with that too. The refs are just maddeningly inconsistent
"Where do I start  1. Between 2015-17, he was notorious for “coasting” during the regular season, only to get the 7th seed and lose in the 1st round every time.  2. “I should be taking that shot” in reference to CJ Miles missing a game winner in the playoffs against Cleveland. He them proceeded to airball the game-tying shot in game 4 and got swept  3. Cheated on his gf/soon to be wife (who was also his coach’s daughter).  4. Got a stripper pregnant, tried to pay her to have an abortion. She refused, so he married her.  5. Presumably fucked Roy Hibbert’s gf, which caused that huge downfall of the Pacers in the 2nd half of 2014. (This one’s not proven so take it as you will)  6. “Playoff P”, along with all the shit-talking with Joe Ingles which came to bite him in the ass  7. “That’s a bad shot”  8. “We’re still in the driver’s seat”, in reference to them blowing a 3-1 lead against Denver. They’d then lose game 7 and the series.  There’s probably more I’m not remembering, but I think you get the point.  Edit:   9. 2-16 performance for 5 points in Game 6 against Utah."
This guy was being compared to Joe ingles  Let that sink in for a moment
"Him and Joe Ingles are the absolute best people I could imagine to represent our country. Patty as a proud, caring indigenous man, and Ingles with the work he does with autism due to his son. Those two make me happy to be Australian."
As always quantity =/= quality. If your roster isn't completely stacked you don't need 8 mid 1st rounders to draft the Joe Ingles of the world. You're gunning for potential superstars and Top 3 Picks are the safest bets to get one.
"Out of curiosity, so if you guys get a ring will you also send one to Joe ingles for winning you the conference finals? Cuz fuck that man should be your finals mvp for saving your season like he did"
I think he’s talking about Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles' jersey is like a shade darker by half-time
"I say it's the other way around. You could be at the lowest percentile of acceptable athleticism for the league but be a prominent role player if you have high IQ, good fundamentals, and work hard on being a specialist like a shooter. Like a Joe Ingles type of guy  Just look at the typical disappointing project players, the guards who never pan out are out in the league in 1-2 years when teams give up on them but even the trash bigs who can still serve as bodies out there still get passed around.   JaVale had such a high floor for how physically gifted he was but skill/IQ just wasn't there"
"The term veteran used to be mid 30’s guy who was once a great player but is now just getting solid minutes and is above average. In today’s league I’d say players become veterans after their second contract (27,28,29 years old) the league evolving to a faster pace is a big reason for this. Can’t just be a Joe ingles guy . Gotta be athletic"
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles over Lebron James.   The sheer embarrassment from James would be legendary.
"If I'm not being whooshed, as an avid bball player, IMO this is wrong and way overthinking it. Sure, it might make sense somewhat logically but fundamentally it's really about practice and eye-hand coordination. I've seen skinny kids with zero muscles or 250lbs beasts with pecs the size of texas be great shooters, so the pec theory doesn't work here.  Go to any gym, it doesn't matter what build a guy has, fat, tall, short, lean, thick, wide, etc, if you can shoot, you can shoot.  Look at Joe Ingles, he flares out his non-shooting arm a lot.   Never judge a shooter by his body. It does *not* matter how your form is, it's all about skills and practice. Plenty of guys with ugly jump shots but they tend to go in.   Your pecs should be the last thing you're thinking of if you're working on your jumpshot. Work on your dip, your wrists, your body aligment, figure which you are comfortable with one-shot motion or two shot-motion, etc, etc.   Another case of science vs reality.

"Joe Ingles ×5 lol, other team fouls out on techs after being Jingled over and over."
Joe Ingles
"Joe Ingles was a missed opportunity for us, we had him and then Doc waived him before the season started. Also when we needed a small forward too. Thanks Doc.  I'd think Andre Miller would be most hated for two things, one for sucking so bad and not halfway trying when he was with us in the Elton Brand days (he was traded for Darius Miles), and then the hip check on Blake Griffin. But older fans would probably point to the first one.  Some also hated Elton Brand too, ClipsNation used to call him FElton because he convinced Baron Davis to come over while he bolted to the 76ers almost immediately afterwards."
"I’m British - I guess Luol Deng for best NBA player listed as British? Joe Ingles and Steve Nash are both British citizens so they kind of count, and there’s a few other honourable mentions like Ben Gordon, OG Anunoby, John Amaechi and Michael Olowokandi."
"I believe he has every skillset and weapon to be a decent 20/5/5 player if unleashed playing in any city not named San Antonio. He can pass, he can defend, he makes clutch play and has a big heart. And most importantly, he plays smart.   If you think he is a role player, you are telling me you can't tell the difference between Spurs Ginobili and today's Jazz Joe Ingles."

"I agree generally, and I’d probably hate players like bev and Draymond if I didn’t spend all those years defending cp3 from similar generalizations.   But Joe ingles is pretty similar, already had a similar reputation as a dirty player, and also just injured a top 3 player, yet he’s treated like a lovable every man on here. No one’s calling him a homeless crackhead. Personally, I don’t think players should be held responsible for protecting the player they’re playing against. That’s the ref’s job"
Maybe that's the account of the one and only Joe Ingles
Both me and Joe Ingles went undrafted that day.
The classy version of Joe ingles 😤
"I mean, think what you want of bev. I ain’t really here to convince you different. I just enjoy saying the racist things this sub says about bev regularly about Joe ingles"
Joe ingles looks like a crackhead!
Also I follow the Jazz but am a Suns fan. I feel nothing for Joe Ingles one way or another.
And which players… go on.    You know Joe ingles actually injured a guy and is also  a dirty player but  you love his white ass.
You said he bonks heads with people every post season.   Pat bev is the classy Joe ingles
Pat bev is the classy version of that guy Joe ingles who looks like a crackhead
"If you wanna do something fun, watch how this sub reacts when you say all the stuff this sub says about pat bev, but make it about Joe ingles instead.   “Joe ingles looks like a crackhead/gorilla(yes this sub did say both those things directly about bev)  “Joe ingles tries to intentionally injure players because he’s a thug.” Etc. it’s a lot of fun."
"excuse you, but the boomers have FIBA patty mills and the white larry bird, joe ingles. what other team can match that devastating one-two punch?"
man i didn’t even know joe ingles was the one who happened to be involved in the kawhi play. that’s how little they talk about it on here 🤣
lol what?  are you actually watching the series?  i haven't seen one person suggest anything was done intentionally.  just like we're not trashing joe ingles for knocking kawhi out the playoffs with the hip check.  it's a fucking physical game.
"No man I watched it, then watched it again several times as the broadcast showed it form a bunch of angles. Shit happens. Don’t think Joe Ingles deliberately hit Kawhi’s knee either but lucky for Phoenix."
"when does joe ingles get the australian TV commercials, didn't four and twenty pies hear about simmons being a fraud"
"Joe ingles isn’t a basketball player, he’s a thug, that’s why he intentionally injures people"
"Lol, I’m going to just keep saying things I’ve seen people on this sub have said about pat bev and just apply them to Joe ingles. Maybe then people will notice how quickly they get racist about it. Anyway here we go:  Joe ingles and jazz bench look like a bunch of gorillas!"
Joe ingles kidnapped Shamoo and put him in a chlorine tank because he enjoyed watching it die.
Joe Ingles stole my Cadillac converter
Pat bev is the classy version of that crackhead Joe ingles 😤
Pat bev is the classy version of Joe ingles.
"&gt; On KOC’s mock draft, he compares him to Sabonis, Vucevic, and Enes Kanter. Honestly, feels like they just picked three bigs who weren’t originally from america  Yup. Also see them comparing Giddey to Joe Ingles, and Moses Moody to other guys with long arms"
"I mean, you don’t plan on Covid, a shortened season, and injuries my man. I didn’t think we’d be able to beat Utah without kawhi. And this was gonna be lob city all over again. And it wasnt. So it sucks. But I guess I’ll just be big mad about Joe ingles saving his cruelest Jingle for us."
How about add Reggie Jackson and Joe Ingles instead?
Love that Ben Simmons and Joe Ingles are the only players in the NBA when watching the Australian stream commercials.
"lmao TIL the Australian national basketball team's mascot is the [Boomers](https://australia.basketball/blog/2021/02/03/australian-mens-basketball-olympic-squad-revealed/).    &gt;Currently ranked #3 in the world, the Boomers will head into Tokyo looking to claim their first ever Olympic Games basketball medal and will do so under the tutelage of Brian Goorjian, who will this year attend his third Olympics as Boomers Head Coach.  I also didn't realize how many NBA players were Aussies.  Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Bynes.  Should be interesting to see how they fare against the US team."
"I would want both of them, Payton Pritchard, Kevin Huerter, Alex Caruso, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Gordon Hayward, Porzingis, and Nico Mannion for no particular reason."
"I wanna see a number 1 pick thats ""the Next Joe Ingles"""
Overrated: Joe Ingles  Underrated: Royce O'neale  Oh shit its history uh Overrated is Carlos Boozer underrated Bryon Russell
but joe ingles was already old when he came here…way easier to pick up things as a kid than as an adult.
Give me Patty Mills and Joe Ingles any day. Delly too
"It's his call of course, but that sounds like a bad idea. He's done this before, hit the gym and skipped playing for Australia, last time he did it he started the next season looking about the same, and  Joe Ingles who played came back looking awesome.   Can't think of a better way to overcome any mental blocks than to spend some time with your people."
Yeah but also Joe Ingles
"I mean he's defending Simmons and over here no matter how badly he shits the bed most people will still defend him just because he's our guy.  We're pretty loyal to anyone who makes it in American sports at all, whether they're a 3rd string college kicker or a superstar in the NBA you'll find kids with their jerseys and news articles where it'll be ""Joe Ingles' Jazz won today""  Shit, we still treat Patty Mills and Delly on the same tier as like a Kemba or something"
"Australia has Ben simmons (stocks an all time low and will probably bitch out but still worth mentioning), Joe ingles, patty mills, delly, baynes, thybulle, josh green (Dallas), broekoff (former Dallas), exum and a bunch of other guys who are either in the NBA or have been in the NBA, doubt any non USA national teams entire roster has that kind of depth"
"Utah doesn’t have a true backup PG. Joe Ingles played that role when Conley was out and he had a really bad Clippers series so it fucked them over. I’m not ready to give up on Conley yet, Chris Paul was injured at the same age and people thought he would be toast. Utah does need to address the secondary ball handler role, preferably someone that can lob the ball to the rim"
"Meh, I dunno, Gaze was Goat, but it is so hard to compare him to any of the guys that have had long successful NBA careers since he barely played at that level (I know it was a different time he was old by the time he got a chance).   Would you take Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Andrew Gaze or Andrew Bogut with your number all Aussie team if picking them at the start of their careers?"
Joe Ingles with the speed of De'Aaron Fox and the athleticism of Ja Morant
But..but.. Bill Simmons says Luka is the best thing since sliced bread and is the modern day embodiment of Larry Bird if Bird was in the modern era..(except we all know the modern day Larry Bird already exists..his name is Joe Ingles).
"Nobody was hyping up the jazz perimeter defenders huh? Joe Ingles and Bogdanovic are both bad perimeter defenders. Conley is pretty solid but he didn’t play. Donovan is neutral on defense but he was hurt. Gobert did not lose them the series, quin snyder did. You don’t know what you’re talking about"
Joe Ingles the best Australian.
"Ben could really benefit from playing in the Olympics and being with the Boomers squad.   He hasn't shown much interest in joining that crew, but being around Patty Mills and Joe Ingles for an extended stretch would do him wonders."
"After Joe Ingles was booted from the playoffs, Gallo is the only player representing the YMCA white dad league"
Joe Ingles is a better passer than Payne...  Clarkson exists too.
"Completely revamp the wing rotation. Niang should not be re-signed, as much as I like him. We need one forward that can play as a small ball 5, another forward that can somewhat isolate on offense, and another forward that is athletic. All three guys need to be able to play positive defense. Unfortunately, every team is looking for wings.  They could also use a true backup point guard instead of using Joe Ingles for primary playmaking duties.  I'm not sure how much other teams are interested in Jazz players, but I wouldn't be against trading Bojan for a 3 and D guy. Perhaps KCP."
"He gets paid 200 million dollars for defense. Literally that is what the entire league values him for. He is supposedly the most valuable defender the league has. We all know he’s absolute dogshit offensively. So if he’s getting paid 200 million dollars, I don’t really think you can blame the lackluster defense on anybody but him. When you pay somebody 200 million dollars solely for defense, you better be expecting this guy to single handedly carry your team on that end because obviously your budget is going to be lower for the others. So I’m not going to blame Donovan or Ingles because it’s on Gobert to defend considering he is the primary reason supposedly for the Jazz being the best defense in the NBA. Yet, despite that, the Jazz played like a below average one against the Clippers.  Again, you keep blaming others. But Joe Ingles does not get paid anything near Gobert and his worth is deemed by his shooting, not his defense. Mitchell has never been a particularly good defender either. Gobert is the so called DPOTY. He’s the 200 million dollar man. He’s supposedly the greatest defender the NBA has ever seen if you look at aNaLyTiCs, so if there’s shitty perimeter defense going on, he should be able to cover for those mistakes. It’s not like their perimeter defense even got that much worse. The only downgrade was Mitchell and he never has been a good defender anyway.   You keep blaming everybody else but Gobert is the reason the Jazz will never win anything. This team has sunk all their money on an immobile and useless on offense big man that can only be played one way. The rockets in earlier seasons abused him in the exact same way the clippers did this series. Gobert turns into a mental midget on drop defense coverage schemes."
"I think there's some misinformation here.  First, I don't think Rudy really suffered from foul trouble this series - he had like, one game early where he got in trouble and Favors had to come in, but I don't think it was as consistent as you're making it out to be. There's a perception he's prone to fouling because he was in trouble during the first Memphis game and always has one or two early, but the only game he played less than 30 minutes was in game 3. Every other game was 32 or more, and the only one he really was put into foul trouble early was in game 4.  Second, he was absolutely contributing - look at the Gobert minutes vs the Favors minutes. Gobert went +5 / +14 in the two Jazz wins, whereas Favors was -2 / -8. Several times in the Jazz' two wins, the lead would shrink when Favors was on the floor, and then extend again once Rudy checked back in. That's not a coincidence. When the Clippers played Zubac, Gobert was ridiculously impactful because that's the kind of scheme the Jazz are built to tear apart. In the losses, Gobert was -1, -4, and -16 (in the big blowout where he sat a while) until this most recent game. None of which can be attributed only to Gobert.  Finally, I implore you, *actually watch the game* and *look at what the Clippers are doing offensively* before blaming Gobert. Your Ben Simmons comparison doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Simmons is a man to man defender. If Trae Young blows by him or breaks his ankles or shoots over him or gets him in foul trouble, that's on Simmons. But it's not Rudy's fault when Joe Ingles can't stay in front of Marcus Morris or Donovan on one leg can't contain Paul George. The Jazz perimeter defense was basically nonexistent this series after the Clippers switched to going 5-out, and any Clipper could get to the rim at will, so Gobert was forced to either concede a wide-open layup, or a wide-open three if he decided to close out on whoever was parked in the corner, and the Clippers also hit a bunch of really tough shots over him in that last game. He didn't play his best, definitely, he could have been more impactful. But to pretend like he's solely responsible for the defensive breakdowns happening on the perimeter is really silly.    It's a tough break, and he definitely showed his offensive limitations that game, he couldn't punish the Clippers when there was a mismatch in the post because he's not offensively skilled, and he let himself get pushed out of his spots too much which neutered his ability as a dunker and lob threat, but the defense wasn't his fault. There was a total lack of schematic adjustment to what the Clippers were doing, and a huge lack of effort by Jazz perimeter defense to contain people going to the basket."
"First, nobody is talking about Joe Ingles in a Pat Bev thread, second, “a much more important player than Westbrook”???? lmao what  You’re weird dude"
"Weird. Joe ingles caused an injury to a much more important player than Westbrook,  and is also a [“dirty player”](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/10/24/joe-ingles-utah-jazz-fine) with a bad rep but you don’t seem to care about this much more present and relevant example."
"He had what 8 years to find a 3&amp;D wing. Ariza was a free agent multiple times in that span, Danny Green was waived twice, Joe Ingles was available for nothing, so was RoCo.  Best he did was Roberson and Sefolosha"
Are you telling me joe ingles isn’t as good as Paul George?! But he has a funny meme about him!
"He’s just saying he hopes Conley stays. He wants him on his team for multiple reasons I’m sure, this is just Joe Ingles personality"
"So does Joe Ingles still own PG? cause i aint tryna see that cringe ""jInGlEd"" shit ever again"
It’s on the coaches Gobert shouldn’t have been in the game for that long  due to match ups. Joe ingles should have played a lot more. Clippers played small and exploited the matchup all night long. Zu was getting into similar problems in the first half then Ty Lue made the adjustments and took him out. Rest is history
Joe Ingles Sr.
Joe ingles
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles did nothing that series   same with Joe Harris   man wow those guys really disappointed me
"No. The scheme was exploited because Conley and Mitchell were hurt and Joe Ingles can’t guard anyone faster than him. They were the liabilities, but the prevailing take is “hurr durr Gobert bad” and you are a puppet. You clearly don’t know enough about basketball to make educated comments about schemes."
"I wanted to see him get some minutes, but Ersan isn't a good defender at all now. He's slower than Gobert and Favors, and he can't defend drives.   The spacing would be nice to have, but therein lies another issue this series exposed that I don't see enough discussion about: the Jazz lack isolation scoring. You can space the floor all you want, but Joe Ingles and Bojan Bogdanovic can't beat their man off the dribble. The only healthy player we have that could do that is Clarkson. When the Clippers switched 1-5, they forced the Jazz to beat them via isolation, and they couldn't do it."
I don't know what the Jazz do about Gobert. He's a liability when teams can shoot the three go small and have time to scheme against the Jazz in the playoffs. It would help if the Jazz could find a couple of good 3 and D (emphasis on the D) guys instead of guys like Joe Ingles. But they're going to paying Gobert out the nose for the next few years.
"joe ingles immediately proceeds to hip check anyone in sight. anyway,  enjoy cancun."
i wonder if the joe ingles hip check is dirty. anyway enjoy cancun.
All I gotta say is Terrence Mann is the man and fuck joe ingles
"He wasn’t sitting in the paint except for when they tried 2-3 zone a handful of times where that’s literally what he is supposed to do. And they didn’t rotate at all when they were covering man on man. You can see Joe Ingles literally flat footed and starring at Mann while hugging Morris on some of the highlights of his threes on here.   The issues with the Jazz were they’re unathletic and slow on the perimeter if they’re not just small. Gobert had to cover for that on drives by coming off his guy sitting in the corner because it was either a three or an easy lay up, and the Jazz just let it be an easy three every time.   Just because you have Brook Lopez suck for his reasons doesn’t automatically mean that’s why Rudy got shat on."
"It’s an X out. So The next man (say Joe Ingles) closes out on Gobert’s man, and Gobert or the person whose assignment Gobert originally helped on, closes out on that person’s man.   Ie Donovan’s man drives, Gobert helps, Ingles covers Gobert man, and then Gobert can stay in paint and Donovan close out Ingles man or Gobert close out and Donovan stays on assignment"
Dude turned it over a lot at the start of the 3rd. I wouldn’t blame anyone. Rudy was already limping after he fell on top of Mann in the first half. It is what it is. Props to the whole Jazz team apart from Royce and Clarkson. And Fuck Joe Ingles
"And just like 2018 but vice versa, Joe Ingles has 5 points in game 6 to end up being eliminated."
"I was referencing an interview Ingles did where someone called him the Australian Steph Curry and he said something like ""nah, he's the American Joe Ingles"""

Joe Ingles and Matisse. Delly just sign in the NBL. Bynes is also NBA but he is hurt atm.
Getting blown out by Joe Ingles and Jock Longdale LMAO... Patty looking like prime Jason Kidd with all the assists.

Joe Ingles looks kinda fat. Probably wrong tho. Definitely stronger tho
"Joe ""Finasteride"" Ingles"
So y’all are just getting fucked up off the dribble by joe ingles?? Ok.

Dude Joe Ingles 2/2 from 3.
"No joke though I got a massive spike in anxiety when I saw ""Eric Paschall"" because I was super worried the following words would result in the last seconds (to me) of Joe Ingles being on the Jazz."
&gt;3. trade joe ingles for luka and zion (pending)  FTFY. Quit disrepecting my man Ingles like that.
1. re-sign conley ✅  2. get pashall ✅  3. trade joe ingles for luka or zion (pending)  4. guaranteed 3-peat
Not yet… but it could be the NEXT Joe Ingles!
"Damn, not even a Joe Ingles thrown in for good measure."
That’s not Joe ingles
I mentioned this yesterday but:  **Tracy McGrady for Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley**  I would say that would be the equivalent to if Kawhi was traded for Donovan Mitchell and Joe Ingles.
"Have they actually been okay since the Clippers lost? The pod got bad for a couple of episodes after and I haven't been back yet.  Dudes actively rooting for Pat Bev humourlessly screeching about Joe Ingles being the dirtiest player in the history of sports didn't seem to be worth my money anymore, it was cringey enough for me to take a break after being subbed for over two years and a Handbook fan for years before that.   They took a break and aired the pre recorded eps with Mande and others and when they came back it's like they legitimately understood less about basketball and comedy than Andy.  Idk what happened to them during the break but the fact that some people actually find Joe Ingles funny really did seem to hurt their feelings and send them into some kind of spiral.  I figure I'll re-up as the off season ends and check back in to see if they're back to being funny instead of salty."
"except he isnt  just off the top of my head steph, dame, seth, joe harris, ingles, paul george, klay"
Joe Ingles in another uniform wouldn't look right.
"If you’re an Aussie then root for Joe Ingles and the Jazz. Really likable team. Unless you are looking for a popularity factor, then look elsewhere."
"As a fellow Australian I would recommend not following the 76ers, at least not because of Simmons who’ll probably be gone, you can still just follow Australian players like Simmons when he’s traded or Patty Mills and Joe Ingles pursuing championships, also Jock Landale just signed with the Spurs which will be fun although I doubt he’ll play much. I’d recommended picking a team with a young star so your passion for the nba grows with that player, I think the Thunder would be a great choice for you personally, they have a great young star in Shai, just drafted an Australian (Josh Giddey) with the 6th pick, will likely suck for the next couple of years but will likely be pretty good for a while after that."
"Pick the Jazz. We have Joe Ingles and are generally an underdog franchise, so it feels great when we win. We’re also usually pretty good and have an extremely likable superstar in Donovan Mitchell."
"I seriously doubt it. He just doesn't have the base to be able to handle guarding other 5s at all. He's a 3 who can ball handle a bit, and who can survive if he gets matched up against some 4s.  Think a poor man's Joe Ingles, and you'll have the right idea."
Joe Ingles was an actual 6MOY finalist
"There were three players over 33 who played significant roles on this years playoff teams: Mike Conley, Chris Paul, Lebron. They all had injuries in the playoffs. Goran Dragic, Carmelo, Joe Ingles, Gallinari were probably the next most significant contributors over 32 on playoff teams. Dragic had injuries late in the season. Gallinari had a playoff injury. None played over 30 minutes a game and closer to 20-25 minutes.   The list of guys 33+ who play 30+ minutes deep into the playoffs is a very short list. Lebron, Chris Paul, and Kyle Lowry 2 years ago at 33 are it really in the last few years.   The Lakers are going to have to be really smart to distribute the minutes. Teams are giving too much to some of these older guys in my opinion (not the Lakers necessarily since they’re 1 year deals mostly). We’re going to see some teams stuck on some contracts for guys who fall off the cliff."
"All you've got to do is google Joe Ingles' name and you'll see dozens of articles about rumors about how interested the Warriors are in him. They just signed two players at the vet minimum (Bjelica, OPJ) to fill out their rotation instead of buying 2nd round draft picks. They're not re-signing Oubre unless it's for a S&amp;T, even for a cheap contract, which they might do if they wanted to try and rehabilitate his image before trading him for assets, or if he develops a jumper, adding him to their future core.   They've had multiple comments that indicate that they're looking to compete for a championship pending Klay's health. They even said they weren't a developing program flat-out a week or two ago - [source](https://twitter.com/Con_Chron/status/1407511923969576960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1407511923969576960%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemanhoop.com%2F2021%2F06%2F25%2Fgolden-state-warriors-bob-myers-interesting-message%2F).   I don't think a team focused on development is interested in trading for Joe Ingles, and I don't think a development team would flat out say ""winning matters more than development"". Kuminga is a project. Moody can plug-and-play I think, but definitely isn't as valuable to winning as Ingles is at this point in his career barring an exceptional rookie season. Paschall is good but not as valuable as Ingles, and Looney is good, but if they can find a backup C on a minimum deal then I still think Joe is better.  I don't think that GSW are necessarily in a ""throw all the assets in a deal for stars"" kind of situation, where a guy like Moody or Kuminga have no value for them, but it's been reported by Tony Jones that Utah is interested in Paschall and Moody, and by a few GSW beat writers that Golden State is also interested in Ingles. There's definite interest between the two teams, they're probably in talks, there's just way too much smoke for there not to be a fire. Whether or not anything happens between the two teams is up in the air, but I think if the Dubs weren't open to the idea of trading off youth for veterans to help them win a championship, they never would have picked up the phone in the first place and we wouldn't be hearing about it."
"I mean I hate it less than letting Oubre walk for free, but I’d much rather have Joe Ingles and a number of other players if Schroder."
Joe Ingles looks like a middle age dad who plays pick up at the local YMCA...so thats not exactly shocking at the surface level
Joe Ingles
"So is Joe Ingles.  And he's a 45% shooter.  High BBIQ, great team defender as well.  I just don't see how Oubre is more valuable than Ingles sorry."
"Ok well the Warriors rated Moody high enough to consider him at 7. And even if they didn't, Joe Ingles is not worth a lottery pick."
It's very likely that Joe Ingles is better right now than Moody will ever be.
He was mocked in the top 10 and the Dubs considered him at 7. They aren't trading him for Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles historically has been a good defender.
Mans talking like Joe Ingles already got sent to the Warriors lol.  Isn't it just a rumor? Why would jazz move off a 45% shooter for Kelly Oubre 😂
Joe Ingles looks about 10 years older.
That's Warriors Summer League legend Joe Ingles
not surprising when you look at joe ingles’ face compared to stephen curry’s face lol
Joe Ingles on his deal is worth way more than an overpaid Oubre. And he's probably a better defender.
Joe Ingles everyone. Gonna be weird rooting against him next round
"Ignoring the fact that Bogi is flat out better, and you're not getting a lottery pick who was mocked top 10 for Joe Ingles"
"Lakers fans know. Patty likes to torch teams. I think someone posted on this sub a game from 2012, USA v Australia. Patty was like 8 years old. Was skinny too. I think Joe Ingles was on that team, too, and they were hooping."
Joe Ingles for PM
"Lol, Joe ""FUCK"" Ingles."
Still possible to do trades on the margins to add Arron Holiday or Joe Ingles types. The Warriors front office fucked up by trading for Oubre and then fucked up again by not trading him at the trade deadline. They serve blame for doing a shitty job but a certain group of fans acts like they can do no wrong.
Joe Ingles is missing from the video
"Joe Ingles playing an Andre Iguodala-type role on this Warriors team is something I'm interested in.   If we get Ingles here, im happy with this trade."
Maybe someone like Joe Ingles for both of them?
"For who, joe ingles?"
2021-22 Joe Ingles to Lakers
Love the interviews with Joe Ingles and Patrick Mills. Both seem like great players and great guys
Embrace Joe Ingles as he's the most fun countryman from your lovely country. Thybulle defensively is also a good watch. Don't fall in love with Ben Simmons because he tries to scrub the Australian off of himself.   But yes playing nba 2k would be beneficial in helping you learn players and teams and such
You know damn well I’m not comparing Joe Ingles to Larry Bird lmaooo. My point is there are tons of unathletic players doing well in today’s game. And the Jokic comparison is a good one imo. He’s a SF Jokic. Their passing and craftiness mirror each other.
Even still though there's no way it's a coincidence that his two other comparisons were Joe Ingles and Jokic 😂
"And just one guards defense wouldn't change much, it's Mitchell and Bogdan/Joe Ingles having mediocre/below average defense that hurt even more"
"yeah, like a joe ingles, jordan clarkson, bojan bogdanovic"
"Although I would love DeRozan getting a ring with Lakers, last season they were in the position they were in because they didn't have a reliable sharpsooter. This season is going to be even worse, while Lebron, AD and Russ can all shoot 3, it is secondary for them and DeRozan is more or less the same. They should target a role player like Joe Ingles %100, 3nD is what they need instead of another midrange-rim finisher."
"Clippers were on their way to a chip by being one of the best 3 point shooting teams of all time this season until Joe Ingles pulled a Zaza, no one in the league is able to match up with their small ball 5 out lineup"
"Dude seems happy living that soccer dad life with Joe Ingles in Utah. Can’t blame him, it’s a quiet place and a great environment to raise your kids in."
Bruh Joe Ingles is 33 years old!
...okay well then lonzo is a good comparison. Still not Joe Ingles. And lonzo is closer to lamelo than joe ingles
"For the lads who missed the last 30 seconds don't worry, you didn't miss much  patty thrills got hit fouled, so Joe Ingles bumped his opponent, the Germans weren't happy, so Attacked him, Aron Baynes popped out for the fight, some dude brought a grenade to the fight, and France surrendered   it was a pretty normal 30 seconds"
"Honestly I'm not either, haha.  I'm just trying to point out his projected role and why he was drafted.  And it isn't to be a Joe Ingles player, it's to be more of a lead guard.  I personally am not a big fan of his.  It still annoys me when people just illogical comparisons based on race and country, haha.  That's why I've been adamant in trying to correct the notion."
"Chris Boucher shoots like the superior medieval siege weapon. Everytime he loads up I'm going ""man that's a brick"" and then its just a swish.  Joe Ingles too, especially when he'd have that wild deep dip on his jumper."
Joe Ingles
"Eh, I would say Bron and AD are average shooters, personally, but they can ball out when it matters... example, AD hitting the last second 3 against Denver in the 2020 playoffs, and Bron got streaky too.  But you don't get Bron and AD becaude of shooting, you get them because of their athleticism and everything else.  I think you maximize AD and Bron by having *other* shooters because shooting isn't why they're superstars.  (Bron also sucked at FTs when he came into the league, and still kind of sucks at FTs sometimes.)   Good shooters to me are Seth Curry, Booker, Middleton, Joe ingles, Kyrie, Mccullom, PG, Doncic."
Trade picks 7 and 14 for Joe Ingles /s
"Joe Ingles mentor, this guy is going places"
worse than the process sixers  theres no way you think a team with patty mills joe ingles and matisse thybulle as there best players wins 40 games
Gonna be thousands of Joe Ingles lookin MF on here lol

I want Joe Ingles badly
joe ingles look like one of the homeless guys u see at parks
Lonzo is like a Joe Ingles
"ITT: People overvaluing Ingles.  Joe is a good player but he's also going to be 34 next season and is expiring. There's also been rumors of him retiring soon.   Replacing him with a wing who is almost a decade younger, has better size &amp; plays comparable defense all while moving down 8 picks in the draft wouldn't be a bad trade at all.   As a Lakers fan I'd probably prefer to use Kuzma in a trade for Hield over one for Ingles honestly."
"The thought process would be we’re going to be over the cap for awhile, and Ingles is getting old. In two years it would basically be the difference between having Kuzma or nothing because if we don’t re-sign Joe we won’t have cap space to replace him. Ingles has also been pretty disappointing the last few postseasons and we might think we could add a contributor at 22 but not 30."
Til Joe Ingles Is overrated
Seeing Joe Ingles in a Lakers uniform…I may just die
"I’ll never forgive joe Ingles for being the closest player to kawhi when he got hurt, watch yourself kangaroo man"

"Joe Ingles over Wiggins, I’ve seen enough"
Young white American prospects get compared to Larry Bird. Young white European prospects get compared to Dirk.   It's only fair that young white Aussie prospects will be compared to Joe Ingles
Joe ingles
"probably someone like joe ingles, but he doesnt even start for the jazz (when all are healthy)  so i dunno its a good question  would have to be someone who can shoot the 3 very well, and provide some other decent playmaking/defense, because players like that are good on all teams, which is why i went with ingles in my head"
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
"His highest volume 3PT seasons all exhibit 40-43% on 3P shots (slight outlier in 1990 where he shot 33%). He was considered one of the best shooters and influenced guys like Reggie Miller. So yeah he's just flat out wrong, Bird could definitely shoot the 3. Now granted perimeter defense is more intense these days but with his height and increased practice, he'd probably be like Joe Ingles or better, while dominating other aspects of the game."
"One that has blown me away for a while is CJ Miles, a 15 year vet who joined the NBA in 2005 and is no longer in the league, is only 7 months older than Joe Ingles, a 8 year vet that joined the league in 2014."
Remember when Kawhi got injured?   If not for Joe Ingles Clippers would’ve win it all
I have my money on Joe Ingles.
"Rudy gay, Hassan Whiteside, Jordan Clarkson, Jared Butler, Joe Ingles. Oh wait. That's the Jazz's 2nd team... Damn we're deep"
So regular Joe Ingles.
Just imagine the thought of a loud Joe Ingles.
"Patrick Beverley(will probably be downvoted by okc fans, and that’s fine)  Fair: he plays a bit rough and isn’t careful. Also he shoved cp3 like a bitch.   Unfair: holy shit there’s a lot. that he’s this particularly dirty player who intentionally tries to injure people. He’s no dirtier than a player like Joe Ingles. Hell, I’d say  Jae crowder is the *much* dirtier player who intentionally tries to injure people. Jae crowder intentionally poked pg in the eye in the playoffs, was called out by the lakers in round one,  and took swipes at people’s knees after flopping to the floor in every play. It wasn’t really close. Beverley and Booker bonked heads and articles wrote that Beverley headbutt him. It’s insane.   Even the Russ injury, Russ made the same dive for the ball earlier in the game where he got injured. And Beverley, on every replay is clearly going for the ball."
[This is you last month saying KP should be traded for Joe Ingles and cash considerations.](https://i.imgur.com/9kRvIRP.png)

"Honestly, that's why I'm taking Anthony Edwards over KAT. Joe Ingles over Donovan Mitchell. It's not ultimately who's the BEST player. Gotta look at the group on the floor.   Run Dame at PG, Ant at SG, SGA at F, Jingles at F and Joker at C."
"Battle between Pacific and Northwest. For the Northwest division I'd do:   Damian Lillard, Anthony Edwards, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Joe Ingles, and Nikola Jokic."
Joe Ingles  /thread
This is great news and not surprising  Joe Ingles had a pretty passionate talk with the entire team before last season saying that the team needs to take this seriously because he doesn't want his kids to get Covid.   I remember him saying at the time that everyone was onboard and doing everything they can
ESPN: Joe Ingles disses LeBron
Get Joe Ingles in there too
What do you mean? Joe Ingles is already the GOAT
That Joe Ingles intentionally injured Kawhi
"Would love to see Joe Ingles, World Champion. It's a little crazy he is even in the NBA, let alone one or its most efficient players ever."
"(Sga)MCW, (dort)marcus smart, (giddey)joe ingles, (bazley)lamar odom, (poku)bol bol....  Hmmm????? Lol"
"Is Jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neal and Bogdanovic clearly better than Reggie Jackson, Terrance Mann, Batum and Morris?   I'd say they're pretty even.  Clippers had the two best players in the series."
forget joe ingles is that tall
He would just be tall Joe ingles
"I mean, yeah….  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who’s serviceable on the court, who won’t win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
There is really only 1 obvious option and that's joe ingles
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
Joe Ingles it is.
I suspect Joe Ingles could take over when Barkly calls it quits.
"List:  1. Wilt - whole seasons full of style, like when he decided to lead the league in assists just to try on a new style 2. Dr. J - dunking with style, innovative medical professional style 3. AI - style per pound unrivaled 4. Steph Curry - little known fact, the 3rd point on his 3's is awarded for style 5. Garnett - on fire at all times, always everywhere style  Honorable mentions:  * Paul Pierce - uncle style while outscoring and outplaying your superstar  * Klay - I'd rather be boating style * Joe Ingles - m8 style  And some strong rising contenders:  * Embiid - living in your head style * Trae Young - shimmy and shoot style"
I now want to hear Joe Ingles taunt another player with this line.
"Hard to compare this early, but comparisons i've heard range from Ben Simmons (passing and rebounding), Joe Ingles (style of movement/shooting), Rubio (playmaking ability). One video i saw sees Manu Ginobli comparisons if he improves his jump shot. Again, hard to say so early, but theres not much he's really weak at- his passing is top notch, he's pretty good in the paint, solid on defence. The main criticisms i've seen are that his handle isn't always the tightest (but his craftiness makes up for that most of the time), and hes not the most explosive, but his height etc make up for that, and at 19 that will only improve."
"giddey can have joe ingles spirit but not yet, we need it for another few years"
"Some of the role players don't play with enough effort and some play really dumb. Also, the officiating was so one sided I'm 90% sure Foster was covering the spread of 20+ free throw discrepancy. In no fairly officiated game should Joe ""0.9 FTA career average"" Ingles and Giannis shoot the same amount of free throws."
"&gt;While Reaves, like Caruso, may be incapable of creating an advantage against a set defense of superior athletes   &gt;Further, his sneakily impactful defense has impressed in spite of his diminutive build and negative wingspan.   &gt;At his peak, Reaves’ comfort on an NBA court could lead to something like Joe Ingles-lite production.  &gt;Like Ingles, Reaves could turn his unconventional athleticism, high IQ, and shooting stroke into a career as one of the more productive role players in basketball."
"Joe Ingles is their designated wing stopper in a league filled with superstar wing players. On top of that, Mitchell and their other guards don't always make great rotations (Compare Steph Curry being beat and trusting Green to cover for his mistakes to Jazz guards ball watching). I don't know if it's the players or the coaching, but you can see the jazz players point at each other and shrug mid possession in that clippers jazz series. Having a good help defender only works if everyone is making their rotations."
"Sort of hard to calculate it in bulk since the 2019-2020 season messes everything up and you have to modify it by hand depending on how many games their team platyed... but so far it looks like:  Buddy Hield and Joe Ingles with 99% of available games played, T.J. McConnell with 97%, and Andrew Wiggins with 96%. Then a bunch around 95% like Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jordan Clarkson, Damian Lillard, and Harrison Barnes."
Joe Ingles had the longest ironman streak for a while
Dark Joe Ingles
How many blocks will Paschall have on Joe Ingles tonight?
"Joe Ingles?  Why would you go with that comparison?  They play completely different positions, one is a combo guard the other is a 6’8” forward."
Lmao slow down.. first he has to match Joe Ingles before you can even remotely put him in the conversation with booker.
But Joe Ingles got ejected…
"You can’t teach timing. It’s a natural feel for the game. IQ can get you for when you’re not athletically gifted.. IE, Joe Ingles"

"I don't know, after reading his explanation and re watching the clip it does makes sense. If Joe would had shot the ball normally Paschall would just had pass him by the side with his arm up and his arm would had been fully extended just as Ingles released the ball. And obviously we can see he put the 3 fingers sign."
1. Patty Mills 2. Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles highlights are the best.  https://streamable.com/vlh5bf
The common answer would probably be a 6'1 or shorter rookie or a bum that barely anyone knows but for this im gonna pick some actual good actual good player  * Joe Ingles * Evan Mobley  * Duncan Robinson * Tim Hardaway
can't Jingle Joe Ingles
Azuibuke is our raw big man prospect at 6’10”  Bojan is a 6’7” SF.  Rudy Gay is 6’8”.  Rudy Gobert is 7’1”.  Joe Ingles is 6’8”.  Hassan Whiteside is 7’.  We’re ok on size.
Joe Ingles because of instagram comments on major sport platforms
"its sort of high key--there were three 6 man of the year finalists last year  2 top vote getters?  thats right, jordan clarkson and joe ingles  we got the 6th and 7th man of the year"
Joe Ingles?
Mike Conley gonna lose his job to Joe Ingles.
"What incentive do the Jazz have to do this though?  He's well-liked among the coaching staff/rest of the players, he himself loves it in Utah and he's one of the most popular players among the Jazz fanbase.  Every person involved with the Jazz is happy that Joe Ingles is on the team.  They have no reason to move him, much less to another Western playoff contender."
"No, thank Joe Ingles"
"Lol, the day Joe Ingles leaves Utah is the day he retires &amp; moves back to Australia."
"FROM THE ARTICLE:  &gt; Utah Jazz forward Joe Ingles has agreed to a one-year, $14 million extension, keeping him under contract with the franchise through 2021-**2022**, agent Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports tells ESPN.  His contract ends *next* season."

It’s helping joe Ingles and bojan but hurting the rest
Sloppy Joe Ingles
"We brought back Favors and we are starting Royce O'Neil instead of Joe Ingles and he's playing INCREDIBLE defense... He's actually holding all this shit together.  Joe is now a flamethrower off of the bench with Clarkson.  Conley is playing like Memphis Mike again finally, which is a game changer.   Also, we went to an outside in mentality with all of our shooting capability, which has revolutionized how we get buckets.  Of course Joe is starting when Conley is out."
Look at where the pass hits Ingles hands. Joe barely has to flick his wrist because the ball is perfectly placed in his shooting pocket. Unreal.
That Joe Ingles shot tho 💦💦💦
Whoever said Utah doesn't have a superstar clearly hasn't seen Joe Ingles play.
The superstar nonsense needs to end. The Jazz have international superstar Joe Ingles.

Anybody else spot Joe Ingles in this video?
"I think Dray and Wiggins have both been more impactful than their BPM/VoRP would indicate (especially Draymond). But whether i agree with you depends on what you mean here by ""really good."" If you mean Wiggins is a solid starter now, I'm with you. If you think he is a borderline all-star, hell no.  [EPM,](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm) which takes into account plus/minus data and is a lot fairer to defensive players, has Draymond ranked 82nd overall, and Wiggins at 101. (Steph is 5th, and first in offense).    I still think that underrates Dray, though it's impossible to accurately measure Dray when he's currently the only 5ppg 35% shooter in league history to be indispensable to his team's offense.  I do think the ranking is accurate for Wiggs. And it's not a slight on him. Wiggins has turned himself into a top 100 player in the league, which is to say, a solid starter(5 starters x 30 teams, 150 players). This is a major improvement over Minnesota bust Wiggins. Oher players with Wiggins relative impact right now are Jae Crowder, Justin Holiday, Joe Ingles--good role players. That's where Wiggins is, though he's being asked to do more for us because we're so offensively challenged.  If you want to bump him up a little because of his ability to handle second unit scoring responsibilities--albeit inefficiently--I could accept that. That leaves Wiggins as somewhere around the 90-100th best player in the league. If that's what you mean by ""really good,""  I agree with you. Wiggins is no longer a negative on the court and has become a legitimate role player.   He's a good 4th/5th guy on a contending team--think young Harrison Barnes--being asked to be Steph's offensive sidekick. I'm starting to like Wiggins along with the rest of this scrappy team, but Steph is still hard-carrying this shit"
"Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Royce O'Neale, and Georges Niang are all like that for Utah as well.  Mike Conley is pretty close to making it too, lol.  Still totally crazy for someone like Steph, though.  His offensive load is huge for Golden State."
The disrespect to Joe ingles smh
The disrespect to Joe ingles smh
i agree joe ingles should win mvp since he is playing on the number 1 team and he is a nice fella
The disrespect to Joe Ingles.
"The Nuggets destroyed the Jazz bench. They staggered their starters to play specifically against the weak Jazz bench. That is where their advantage came from. Jazz starters killed it all playoff series long.  This year hapless Tony Bradley has been replaced by Derrick Favors and Joe Ingles is pushed to the bench because we have Bojan back (who was our second leading scorer last year and will probably end up there this year too.)  Last year the Jazz bench was a -8 points per game on average. This year the bench minutes are a positive. The starters are ridiculous.   Are you just going to ignore that a major cog of the Jazz offense was missing in the playoffs last year? I mean no excuses, you still gotta win, but yeah, the offensive rating will definitely be affected. I guarantee that if Paul George misses the upcoming games against the Jazz you will factor that into the pot if the Jazz sweep.  In any case, it would be a good series, even though i think you are vastly overrating the Clippers Pick and roll defense. I guess they could entirely neutralize one of the best pick and roll combos in the league. They haven't shown an aptitude for doing that either this or last season, though."
Joe Ingles???
joe ingles  kerr is too cute with it
Joe Ingles should start the all-star game.
"So, if you and your wife are out for the evening, and Rudy Gobert or Joe Ingles rolls up, and one (or both) of them starts spitting game at your wife, you should be good?"
"Coach?  I could see a team throwing money at Chris Paul when he retires to coach.  Commentator, I could see Joe Ingles doing that as a gig when he retires, but probably back in Australia."
Joe Ingles underrated.
And do people think that the Governor is just ruling and signing orders non-stop 24/7?  Let the man who appointed Joe Ingles and interim Lt Governor for a day watch the damn Jazz game and take a potshot at Shaq.
But plus Joe Ingles so it evens out
Yeah I’m definitely having a huge get off my lawn moment in this thread right now   They’re a really good team but get back to me in June. Feel like I’m about to stumble on some Gobert is basically just Duncan takes and Conley is Parker with defense. Oh and I’m sure Donovan Mitchell is a better player than Manu and joe ingles is Boris diaw on a diet.

Anyone who wants to see some great pics of people and things dunking on Shaq should head over to our sub. Highlights include  Joe Ingles Gail Miller (Elderly former owner) Mini Van Sexual Favors Rudy And the list goes on
Every day you wake up in Joe Ingles' world you run the risk of going to bed a friccin moron
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles.
Joe Ingles is the missing link between neanderthals and the Splash Brothers
Joe Ingles. That is all.
League Pass is basically just showing Joe Ingles trolling everyone on the court warming up haha  I love that man
"What about Joe Ingles? Dude looks like a 45 year old used car salesman but he crosses dudes up with some of the best trash talk in the league. Caruso would have like 2 sportscenter highlights but he wouldn’t be an all star vote getter or loved like he does on the lakers. It happens all the time. The lakers fanbase is big enough that especially when they’re having a bad season, one of their players becomes randomly super popular."
"Not because he’s worse than Donte, but our bench is trash and him with Bobby could be a great tandem like Jordan Clarkson and Joe Ingles.  Literally the exact same way he’s utilized with the Raps lol."
"Joe ""YMCA"" Ingles"
"You can't stop him. You can only hope to contain him. Also, I'm looking forward to kyle Anderson vs Joe Ingles whenever they match up next"
joe ingles is the best
"&gt;Also better physical training is a part of athleticism. Like I was way more athletic when I was working out and playing regular pickup pre-pandemic than I am now sitting on my ass all day. It's not just an intrinsic quality; it can be developed.  Sometimes the top guys are just freaks though.  There have been plenty of NBA players with terrible diets and poor work ethics who played with crazy athleticism when they were young.  I believe Derrick Rose subsisted mostly on candy in his early years.  Bo Jackson said he never lifted weights but he was insanely strong and fast.       I agree that athletes are probably marginally better now because of the expanded talent pool and training options, but I think the effects of that are enormously exaggerated.  The biggest difference in today's game is what athletes are selected based on how it's played.  Ben Wallace is a freak athlete, but he probably could not be effective in today's game.  His best skill is interior defense and it matters less and less.  He has less top tier post players to match up against.  Joe Ingles is not a freak athlete, but he is extremely effective in today's game with the spacing and freedom of movement that didn't exist in the past."
"As soon as I heard Joe [Ingles] and trash talking, I was sure that what would come next is gold, lol.  Aussies just hit you different with it."
The part about Joe Ingles lmao. “What are you running out of guests”
Joe Ingles is the Orange Cassidy of the NBA. IYKYK
"In this case, also 42% 3pt shooter Bogdanovic and 45% 3pt shooter O'Neale on the perimeter. As long as Ingles is sealing that he can pass for as good wide open shooters in any opposite direction from a help of Sabonis or Brogdon between him and the rim (Mitchell is a 41% 3pt shooter, but the one guarding him ain't in a position to get between Joe and the rim, which is no bad either), he gets a free pass to get close enough for a floater (and the fact that he does it slowly actually may help adjust his body posture for the shot)"
Excuse me have you ever heard of uncle Joe Ingles??
Joe Ingles is the Honda Civic of NBA players.
"DeSagana Diop, Joe Ingles, then LeBron"
Joe Ingles is European?
"Fair enough, but you did Wall dirty.  Give him at least a name rotation player like a Morris twin or Joe Ingles."
"Terrence Ross, patty mills, joe ingles"
"He’s essentially Joe Ingles, who every team would love to have"
He’s still playing but it’s Joe Ingles
I certainly would love to have Joe Ingles on my team. He’s one of the best role players in the entire league.
"Tim Duncan, joe ingles, Russell Westbrook, dame, Steph"
Joe Ingles and it’s no contest.
"Joe Ingles is playing the game like he’s supposed to play too, does that mean he is also MVP?"
"joe ingles is #0, he's transcended all."
interesting 🤔... joe ingles must be #11 then?
"Top 20ish Donovan Mitchell elevates his game in the playoffs and the Jazz already have a top 15 guy in Gobert. They also have arguably the deepest bench in the league, including two guys in Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson who could be starting for other playoff teams and they will have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs so they've got as good a chance to won it all this year as anyone else and anyone who says they're not contenders is a clown. They do have one very clear achilles heel though and there's a chance it gets exposed and their success will be matchup dependent just like every other team."
"&gt; There is a grand canyon sized gap between Popovich and those 2 coaches.   At the end of the day, it is about the players and buying into the system and that is exactly what you have in these situations.  &gt;It had 3 hall of famers  3 slightly washed HoF'ers and 1 future HoF. I just got through watching Joel Embiid dominate the Suns. When I watched him, Joel Embiid was doing Joel Embiid things to the Suns like a superstar. It isn't like you had Tim Duncan doing superstar things that playoff and winning. You had a great team play great winning ball making every possession on both sides of the ball count and that is exactly what you have with the Suns and Jazz this year.   &gt; great depth  Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson have been pretty damn great. The Suns Cam Johnson and Cam Payne have been pretty damn great. In terms of [net rating](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StarterBench=Bench&amp;sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1), the Suns have the highest net rating bench in the league while the Utah Jazz are also in the top 5 at number 4. Both of these teams have excellent depth.  &gt;They haven't yet earned that status.  That is the whole point of trying to predict things. It is easy to say someone is a championship player after they are Champion. Everyone can say who is the championship team after the season and the post season is over.   &gt;Regular season is nice  Regular season is the best predictor of post season.  &gt;they need to both prove they can get out of the 1st and 2nd round first.  Great, ya ok lets talk about which team won after they won then. The 2020 Lakers are a Championship team. Bold statement, I know."
Joe ingles would never...
Joe Ingles was already on the Jazz
This is the MVP ladder and it’s undebatable:  1. Brad Wanamaker  2. Julius Randle  3. Alex Caruso  4. Michael Jordan  5. Joe Ingles
"Bad take.  Also I called the Nets injuries back in December. When you build a team that consists of 3 aging superstars, Joe Harris, and a bunch of mostly-scrubs, you’re gonna lean too hard on those 3 superstars (one of whom was coming back from a serious injury) and they’re gonna get hurt. That shit is on Steve Nash and the Nets front office. Nobody gets to call the Nets the best team in the league when that judgement is based on a hypothetical scenario where 3 guys play 40 minutes a night for 72 games in 5 months and not run into problems.  Lakers aren’t that much better. Lebron is 36 and hasn’t been injury free the past few years. AD is 28 (which isn’t old, but isn’t young) and has had a variety of injuries in his career, and the Lakers all but depend on those two to win them games. They’re probably a playoff team but definitely not better than a first round exit without those two.  Jazz’s oldest major players are Conley and Ingles. Conley has been rested a LOT to prevent injuries this year. Ingles has rested a couple games too—which is huge because prior to this season he had the longest streak in the NBA of not missing a game. He also plays EXTREMELY low-impact non-physical basketball. It’s easy to see how he avoids injuries just watching him play. The rest of the Jazz are either mid-career or young, and they’ve all been played carefully.  Also helps that the Jazz team is deep—they miss a couple guys, and they probably still win.  And that’s why the Jazz have the best record. They’re hands down one of the best teams—i think even if the Laker’s and Nets were healthy they’d be competing for the top spot in the league—but they’re THE best in terms of the way they were built by the front office and the way they’re managed by their coach and staff, and, well, as the standings show, that shit is important.  The Jazz are proof (as if the Durant/Curry/Thompson team wasn’t proof enough) that Superteam/Superstar basketball is dangerous and relies heavily on health to be sustainable. Which is why it’s so shitty that regular season play isn’t rewarded more. If the only important part of the season is the playoffs, teams don’t give a fuck if players get injuries as long as they can scrape a low playoff seed and then bring them back and hope for the best for the important one month at the end of the season. Rewarding regular season play would force teams to build sustainable lineups and take care of their players in the long haul."
"Joe ""james"" ingles with the double step back"
Celtics sign Joe Ingles to a one-day contract to mix the secret phrase into his casual trash-talk. No one would even notice.
Man could you imagine Joe Ingles with the confidence to shoot the 3 like Miye Oni
How dare you disrespect Joe Ingles!
"No because as good as Gobert is at the things he does, he will have a really hard time matching that impact come playoff time.   Also something that Gobert probably doesnt get enough credit for but he should is that he's the only real elite defender on his team. So Draymond use to have Iggy and Kawhi had Duncan as a tandem. Does anyone really think Joe Ingles and Royce Oneal are gonna stop stars on the perimeter?"
Joe Ingles.
"&gt;I'd fully expect Joe Ingles to come out of introductions with a crown, scepter, and leopardskin cape, full WWE style  This would be incredible LOL"
"Rudy's actually pretty chill. . .  I'd fully expect Joe Ingles to come out of introductions with a crown, scepter, and leopardskin cape, full WWE style, in the introduction of every game the next season though. I'd buy a podcast of his trash talk every single game too."
"Joe Ingles at driving pick and roll pass fakes to create a shooting opportunity for a scooping left handed layup.       Karl Malone, pulling the chair on a big that's attempting to post up.      John Stockton, swiping down for a strip/steal on a jump shooter."
None of those dudes have gone 2-16 for 5 points in a 5 point loss while getting outplayed by Joe Ingles in a game 6 elimination game
This is true because we know it should have been Joe Ingles.
"I bet he was so mad when D Wade became a part owner he burned his Joe Ingles jersey, because we know he doesn’t have a Donovan Mitchell jersey for “reasons”."
Thought this would have been about Joe Ingles before I read Steph Curry
Joe Ingles play better as a starter. That is the argument. Cant win 6th man like that
One day we'll all have to wake up from the dream that is Joe Ingles and we'll all be worse for it.
Joe Ingles on PG tho
So basically if Steph Curry was Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
"He's not wrong, Joe Ingles has been ridiculous recently.  That Curry bloke has been alright too I guess..."
"5 Joe Ingles, 5 Andrei Kirilenkos, and 5 Rudy Goberts."
"It doesn't matter that much.  Steph's 3-point percentage is 52.9% when the nearest defender is ""very tight"" (0-2 ft.), 38.6% when they're ""tight"" (2-4 ft.), 43.2% when he's ""open"" (4-6 ft.) and 45.9% when ""wide open"" (6+ ft.).  He's shooting 40% from 3 when there's a tight or very tight contest of his shot. He's shooting 51.3% overall under such circumstances.  For reference, Dame is at 33.7% on tight/very tight 3s. Joe Ingles, who is shooting 48.6% from deep, has made 30.8% of his most contested 3-point attempts."
"Joe ""Steph Curry"" Ingles"
Joe Ingles is a very underrated shooter
Joe Ingles
they might think hes joe ingles if we dont talk about it that much
Joe Ingles will win it.
Joe Ingles is jingling all of LA tonight
Joe Ingles is trying to show Steph Curry up tonight
The juxtaposition of Marc Jackson saying high powered offense as Joe Ingles strolls up to the three point line and does his classic slow release is amazing.
god i love Joe Ingles
Imagine having Joe Ingles as your 7th man? Oh wait I don’t have to
Joe Ingles might need to switch shoes soon. He wears a Kobe 2015 or something. The equipment guys have to order off the second market every couple weeks.
&gt;a poor mans draymond isnt better than randle or ingram   &gt;Of course I didn't mean literally that he was better but he was the 27th pick. Do you know how many 27th picks pan out like him?   I literally never said that he was better than Randle.  &gt;Clarkson looks like he’s. going to be 6MOTY and he’’s the 46th pick which by your standards makes him more impressive than Nance.  Clarkson started red hot and since he has cooled down and tbh Joe Ingles is making a better case for 6MOTY than Clarkson   &gt;and he’’s the 46th pick which by your standards makes him more impressive than Nance.  There isn't a big difference between the 27th and 46th pick because you can basically buy those picks for cash while there is a huge difference in expectation between a #2 or #7 pick and the 27th pick.
Yeah I do see a lot of players do a lot of smaller charity work that goes unnoticed.   ie Joe Ingles currently has a charity auction going
Superstars attract more viewers = more money. I don't think names like Norman Powell or Joe Ingles will attract viewership.
&gt;Lakers/Jazz  Are you insinuating Joe Ingles is merely mortal?
Joe ingles plays for Utah
Could always support a team that has an Aussie on it like the 6ers with Ben Simmons or Jazz with Joe Ingles. Just happen to be the teams at the top of each conference
I love Joe Ingles so much. Happy to know hes balling
"Noice. Joe Ingles currently sits at 52/49/87 so he's got a small chance, but certainly not as likely as Tony Snell"
Whichever team has Joe Ingles. Easy answer.
"I legit think you could make a solid case for any of the starters and 1st rotation players on the Jazz roster. Jingling Joe ""The Accountant"" Ingles is definitely the head of that list tho"
"joe ingles. the nets could offer all of Kyrie, KD and Harden and I'd still have to think about it"
"If Joe Ingles ever plays anywhere but Utah, I may just quite watching the NBA altogether"

"Dwight powell is the true Offensive GOAT, not Joe Ingles who cheats with 3 pointers"

Joe Ingles displaying assist mastery
"... Yes, Joe Ingles. The famous spot up shooter. It's not like he's been our primary or secondary playmaker for almost every possession he's been in the floor for the last six years."
Well we've already seen what happens when Playoff P meets Joe Ingles in the postseason.
Who knew Joe Ingles was the best guard on the team?
"Yeah, I don't think Joe Ingles is up to the challenge of locking down AD."
Gotta have Joe Ingles on your list bro
Joe Ingles could fuck my wife AND my mom and I’d still just say thank you
Joe Ingles. Wow.
Joe Ingles: best TS% in nba history.  The GOAT
"People don't understand that while TS% indeed does matter, it's only ONE stat among a billion other things that a player can do well on the court and be great. Is Russell Westbrook an inefficient scorer? Yes, but he also has a 61-win pace everytime he posts a triple double, is a great playmaker on offense (five of the last six years averaging 10+ assists) and everyone talks about how great of a leader he is.  Saying that Russ isn't great because of his TS% is like saying that AI wasn't great because of his TS%, you are literally ignoring every single aspect of basketball and only focusing on scoring efficiency.  If TS% was the only thing that mattered, Joe Ingles and Rudy Gobert would be the best duo in the league with their sky high efficiency, heck Zion Williamson and his 65% TS makes him better than LeBron ofc."
I mean Joe ingles is right there. He's played every other position on the court this year.
What???? Joe Ingles is clearly going for 60 shots not Clarkson
im being hyperbolic but i just checked and how is joe ingles shooting 49% from 3 on 5 attempts per game
Joe Ingles is not a deity.
"If life was Michael Scott, Joe Ingles would be dead by now"
Releasing Joe Ingles to sign some nobody was such a classic move by the genius talent evaluator that is Doc Rivers.  Too bad Jingles wasn't a former Celtic or he would've been signed on the spot.
I think he may mean source for the Joe Ingles connection you claim exists
The west runs through joe ingles
Nah Joe Ingles will win it next year
How are you so sure Joe Ingles isn’t moonlighting at the help desk for Adobe?
Joe Ingles owns everyone. We revolve around Joe Ingles
Ben Simmons and Joe Ingles. The GOAT wizard of Oz.
And Joe Ingles owns Paul George.
Paul George and Joe Ingles
"It used to be Joe Ingles, then it became Royce O'Neale, then it became Georges ""George"" Niang, and now it's probably Miye Oni. He's going to be really good next season."
Joe Ingles'...everything is starting to reach this criteria.
"You can argue that Dame is a better player, but Joe Ingles has objectively contributed to more wins this season."
got destroyed by a rookie donovan mitchell and clowned by joe ingles.
"Joe Ingles is a meme, but he is the glue for the jazz’ chemistry and is also a lethal player. He’s a huge part of our success"
&gt;but he's not the best player on his own team  So then why don't we hear any Joe Ingles for MVP chatter?
"The Jazz are just about the least injured team in the league so it doesn't really count but in the 15 combined games that Mitchell and Conley have missed, Joe Ingles' has stepped up.      He's been inserted into the starting lineup in those games and has averaged 17/4/5 on 54/52/88 shooting as a starter this season."
"He has Joe Ingles as his flair, we all know what kind of guy he is."
"And they still lost the game, even with Tobi putting up 36 as well. Also, if he says he put that up on Gobert, in the same game Jordan Clarkson also scored 40 on Ben in 29 minutes 13/20 shooting with 7FTA (compared to Ben's 38min 15/26 13FTA and Tobi 37min 14/24 5FTA). Joe Ingles also put up 20 in that game on 8/12 shooting, Donovan 24 on 9/24. By his logic I guess neither of them really deserve the DPOY.     If it was up to me Ben would win the DPOY, but its pretty apparent the league has always favored bigmen in winning that award. I think Gobert still has just as strong of a case as Ben tbf."
could you imagine if joe ingles was unironically the best player in the league?  yeah hed be famous.
Yeah..Royce O'Neal gets zero love on this sub by everyone not a jazz fan. Sure Joe Ingles is a beloved meme but no one appreciates what he does outside of Salt Lake  I fucking love Caruso but he gets way more exposure by simply being a Laker. He deserves it but other teams guys deserve it too
Joe Ingles was hype for a while to be fair lol. Caruso would at least be similar imo.
"If you removed Joe Ingles from the Jazz, how would that change the numbers?  He was drafted ""75th"" in 2009, and then signed by the Jazz as a free agent in 2014. What does this even tell us? The Jazz didn't draft him. They didn't even really develop him, he was already a pro for 5 years. He wasn't ever ""untalented"".  Anthony Edwards and LeBron get the same score, both drafted #1. How does making these two players equal in ""this is how much talent this team have"" even make sense?  Same goes for multiple #1s that are no longer elite players (Rose, Griffin) are both ""better"" than Durant.  This is some pretty flawed data analysis if you ask me."
Joe Ingles is a such a great dude. Also a fun player who’s had some really solid years but I can’t get enough of his sarcastic humor.
Joe Ingles
I have no issue with the Jazz donating whatever they want to donate. They are under no obligation to donate anything. I just find the idea that a child's future is literally dependent on whether Joe Ingles makes a bunch of threes one night to be something youd expect in a book about life after the fire nation attacked or after the 15th hunger game or something
Joe Ingles bout to daddy dick Wayoff P. Friccin moron.
"Probably someone's IFTTT.  IF: r/nba thread mentions ""ingles"" or ""jingles"" or ""jinglin' joe""  THEN: Tip thread with wholesome award and upvote."
I want Joe Ingles to tell me that he would never lie to me.
"In the 57 games Bertans has played this season, he had 16 games where he shot less than 33%.  In the 62 games Steph Curry has played this season, he had 15 games where he shot less than 33%.  In the 67 games Joe Ingles has played this season, he had 16 games where he shot less than 33%. If you include games less than 34%, **Joe Ingles had 26 games where he shot less than 34%.**  I have a feeling the guy you're responding to doesn't watch a lot of Wizards basketball. As a die-hard Spurs fan, I always follow the youngins who move on from us. Bertans is playing good basketball, its really hard to find your rhythm behind two guys who are arguably one of the most ball dominant players in the league, and a coach with a peanut for a brain.  Bertans is taking 7.5 threes a game at 40%. That's worth $16 million a year."
"Yeah I definitely agree. I also think there’s a lot of guys who are so good at their role that I value them more than a lower impact young guy putting up good numbers on a bad team.   I think having guys like Kyle Anderson, Jarrett Allen, Joe Ingles, Robert Covington helps teams win more than Garland. Ingles is a pretty egregious omission from this list imo."
"I think it's a good argument until you look at their actual numbers. Steph really averaging 32ppg on 65.5 TS%. Joe Ingles just had one of the best shooting seasons ever and he finished at 68 TS%. Steph's second and third best offensive players were Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins. But I'd agree that generally, I think the latter is more impressive, and I'll admit that I'm biased."
"I’m convinced Garrison Matthews is gonna be the next Joe Ingles. In a few years, he’ll randomly show up on some contender as one of the league’s best role players, and we’ll wonder “where the hell did this guy come from?” only to realize he was on the bench of an NBA team who desperately needed his skillset."
"Def. holding back the Science teacher. Really great teammate and shooter. Always there when you need an extension on your homework due date, or give an extra credit assignment to bring up your grade. No but seriously I bet Joe Ingles hasn’t missed 1/3 of Education Reforms missed games since he left Utah."
"Nah.  Ingles is much more flexible, but both are really good at their roles.    We've tried running Joe with the bench unit, he can't really carry an offense on his own.  JC is great at that.  But at the same time Ingles works better with the first unit with other offensive weapons because he's a better playmaker.  Probably better at running the P&amp;R too.    I'm just happy to have both."
"Agree there, but I think Clarkson edges Ingles out just because of the massive jump in his play overall. Where Joe has been solid since he came into the league. But Joe definitely does more overall for the Jazz.  Though, they definitely needed that bench scoring to push them to where they are now."
"Full list of everyone who qualifies for these filters (i.e. everyone who has made more than 50 pull-up threes since the ASB):  Steph Curry - 93/229 (40.6%)  Damian Lillard - 95/245 (38.8%)  Anthony Edwards - 55/142 (38.7%)  Buddy Hield - 53/139 (38.1%)  Jayson Tatum - 65/178 (36.5%)  Luka Doncic - 90/262 (34.4%)  CJ McCollum - 59/175 (33.7%)  Lowering the threshold to 40 adds Jrue Holiday (43/103, 41.7%), Joe Ingles (47/119, 39.5%), Donovan Mitchell (50/129, 38.8%), Zach LaVine (48/137, 35.0%), Kemba Walker (42/126, 33.3%), and Jordan Clarkson (49/175, 28.0%)."
"&gt;*There are  And this is just a very agreeable list.   Other main candidate for DPOY is Ben Simmons. But he just isn't as much of a presence on the entire team's defense.   And as for 6MOTY, legit the only options even **CLOSE!** Are Jordan Clarkson, and Joe Ingles.   Yes there are Jazz, but the Jazz are kinda leading the league."
Joe ingles [Head Bandage.] (https://3gz8cg829c.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/image-renderer/original/full/743/center/80/185061b4-d5cc-4723-956a-58dd6270613d-joe.JPG)  It looked even better when [he wore it in black.] (https://imgur.com/8e3Y0k6)
Joe Ingles?
"Joe Ingles ain’t getting the award but it’s not because he doesn’t deserve it. JC in his bag this year, and he will get it."
"Lamar Odom won 6MOTY, I don't see why Joe Ingles shouldn't. Not that I particularly care whether Ingles or Clarkson wins it as a neutral party. I'd be happy for them both, and the Jazz win in general."
Joe Ingles is a meme guy and imo 6man of the year this year
"&gt; Except when Conley and Mitchell went down (separately and together) he's the player they turned to be the key player in their offence. Not Clarkson  But that's the thing: much as I love the guy you can't really put Ingles out with the second unit and expect them to have enough firepower offensively.  We tried that last season and it didn't really work (a fair chunk of the Jazz sub was memes about how bad our bench was), and it's why we picked up JC in the first place.    One of the two was going to have to slot into the first team as the ball handler / playmaker with our starting back court out.  JC probably could've done a decent job, but we needed him more for bench firepower, which Joe couldn't have really provided."
"Tired with jingling the league, Joe Ingles has now started Jingling his teammates"
The case for Joe Ingles is pretty clear...  Is the team worse if they lose Joe or Jordan?   Pretty clearly Joe.
Joe Ingles ROY = Joe Ingles Rampages on YOU.
Every thinks the Jazz are locked in the conference with the Lakers.  The Lakers are actually locked in the conference with Joe Ingles.

Joe ingles ROY
When joe ingles was starting out playing in australia he was one of the most athletic in the league not so much now tho
joe ingles has finished top 5 in 3pt percentage at least twice before that i can recall  not a huge surprise
"They also call Ingles ""Slow-mo Joe""."
"Man, we have some fucking generational clowns in this thread. It's obviously Mark Eaton, but nephews wouldn't know about him. 2 DPOYs and this sunnufabitch could barely move. Slower than anyone you dummies have mentioned. Gasol? Ingles? Stop it, these people are nimble ballerinas compared to the lumbering tower of power that was this 7 foot 4, 300 pound auto mechanic. I'm not sure I've ever seen him jump on film, just a little toe-bounce maneuver. He made an All-NBA team too so Joe Ingles can suck on my Joe dingle you pathetic circlejerking divas."
"Sooooo....Joe Harris eclipsed him in 3P%, 3PA, and 3PM (not to mention games played and minutes played). Why does Ingles age make it a more impressive feat? Shooting mechanics aren't really affected by age."
Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles
Joe Harris won the 3-point shooting title this year with a .475% and congrats to him. I dont mean to take anything away from Joe Harris as he is an incredible shooter and deserves all the praise he receives. Joe Ingles had quite the season in comparison.   **Joe Ingles -**  33 years old  Minutes played = 1867  3 Point % = .451  3’s attempted = 406  3’s made = 183 total (2.3 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  **Joe Harris -**  29 years old  Minutes played = 2141  3 Point % = .475  3’s Attempted = 444  3’s Made = 211 total (3.1 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  Not bad for an undrafted player who was waived by the Clippers in 2014. The Utah Jazz gave him a chance and the rest is history.  I also found this interesting..  &amp;#x200B;  **Utah Jazz All-Time 3-Pointers Made Leaders:**  &amp;#x200B;  1- Joe Ingles – 993 (7 Seasons)  2- John Stockton – 845 (19 Seasons)  3- Donovan Mitchell – 726 (4 Seasons)
&gt; **The Deadshot Award (presented by Ray Allen/Reggie Miller)** &gt;  &gt; best qualifying 3 point percentage (Basketball-Reference): &gt; &gt; 1.    Joe Harris (47.5%) &gt; 2.    Marcus Morris (47.3%) &gt; 3.    Bobby Portis (47.1%) &gt; 4.    Bryn Forbes (45.2%) &gt; 5.    Joe Ingles (45.1%)  pro tip for shooting 3s: have a 6 letter last name that ends in S
Joe Ingles
"Thats scoring blindness, Joe Ingles can create offense outside of isolation situations and is a better defender than Clarkson. Super high value off the bench"
Joe Ingles is the spirit animal for many redditors.
"Either this, or Joe Ingles winning every award would be acceptable."
Joe Ingles the goat.
&gt;a team without a superstar  *Joe Ingles intensifies*
"A bigger issue is the warriors defense.  Let’s assume draymond can keep Gobert on ice (unlikely but not impossible)  Jazz still have Conley and Mitchell to create, and if we assume Wiggins plays great defense they still have 1/2 of those guys to create. (Not to mention the more energy exerted on defense will lead to a lower offensive output).  Even after all of those unlikely occurrences the Iazz still have one star to create and their bench depth and shooting. Joe ingles, Clarkson etc.   The warriors defense isn’t good enough about"
Tell Quin Snyder to stop playing Joe Ingles over Clarkson at the end of games then
&gt; I know they’re far from title favorites but it’s a great accomplishment for a team without a superstar.  The disrespect to Joe Ingles is real
"I agree, Joe Ingles will definitely get the Jazz some wins."
Isn't joe ingles bettee than JC?
"Jokic, Gobert, Monty Williams, Anthony Edwards, Julius Randle, Joe Ingles"
Joe Ingles
"I mean, he has the 2nd most 3 pointers made in a season ever. If it wasn't for a guy named Steph, he would have the 1st and 2nd most made in a season. The difficulty was insane those years too.   But lets look at a top 10...  1. Steph  2. Dame  It gets debatable after that in no particular order  3. KD 4. CJ 5. Duncan 6. Redick 7. Joe Harris 8. Seth Curry 9. Paul George 10. Kyrie  Not sure I put Harden in top 10 of simply ""shooter"" either. I guess ahead of PG or CJ?   Guys who could be top 10 if you swapped any of those out... Harden, MPJ, Ingles?"
Placing a bet on Joe ingles at +200 just because of this thread lol
Coty Monty williams  6th man    joe ingles
"You’re just replying to say something. His performance against the Warriors, Jazz, and POR were not due to injuries. More so against OKC/LA last year. He had 3 20+ games against LA but also 2 10 point games. Coming off injury he had 7/17/20 against OKC. Proof is in the pudding and unless he can make it out the first round without a co-star, he’s not going to be considered a playoff threat. I doubt Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are shitting their pants over someone that couldn’t get past Joe Ingles and a Rookie"
&gt;Joe Ingles really about to win this after his teammate was the frontrunner all year lol  So few votes though. There's tons of volatility in voting for MIP and Sixth Man.
Joe Ingles? What
Joe Ingles really about to win this after his teammate was the frontrunner all year lol
"VORP must be garbage, it clearly ranks Joe Ingles 30 places too low"
All I’m seeing is that Joe Ingles is being underrated in the GOAT discussion

I wish everyone except Joe Ingles’ nephew the best of luck!
Joe Ingles fills the big tittie anime catgirl quota too.
"This is kind of a side note, but it's absolutely wild that Teague and Korver were all-stars that season.  It's like Joe Ingles being an all star this year"
Joe Ingles?
"Joe Ingles, if you don't already consider him a star. . ."
No one will eliminate Joe ingles
It’ll have Joe Ingles so that makes up for it
Joe Ingles
Clearly Adam Silver wants to see Joe Ingles and Bryn Forbes in the NBA finals
Vogel is a Joe Ingles fan confirmed.
"No, now it's Joe Ingles."
"Ok. I don’t see how any team doesn’t get worse if a superstar goes down-but apparently you think UTAH is that stacked and that deep. I guess we will see.  Injuries piling up, no worries I guess Joe ingles will lead us to the finals."
Joe Ingles?
Have you met Joe Ingles?
You know joe ingles is on your team right.
"OK Joe Ingles is the best shooter(besides Steph) on the planet by ""a wide-ish margin""! Still sound biased?"
"Pls show stat that Joe Ingles is better wide open shooter than Joe Harris by ""the widest of margin"""
You misspelled Joe Ingles.
And miss out on all the lols of Paul George losing yet again to Joe Ingles?
"I agree, Shamet isn't very good, but the fact that he and Redick had career years at 20 and 35 years old shows you how three point specialists can flourish next to Jo and Ben.    Guys making less who could fill the role: Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, VanVleet, Buddy, Clarkson, Rozier, Gary Trent.  All players who takes at least 2.5x as many threes as Harris.  Brogdon was another guy who moved and signed for a lot less than Harris got who I think would make the team better.  They would look awesome as sixers and we could probably have two of them for what it took to get and resign Harris.  It's hard to say exactly what was available so I can't just say they should have signed Kawhi, Kyrie or KD but the sixers took themselves out of the running for a superstar by trading for the 58th best player."
"Lol, blatant abuse of officiating favoring the small market Utah Jazz- now that's one I haven't heard before!  When you have an all time great and marquee player like Joe Ingles chirping in your ear all night I'm sure as a ref that starts to impact your decision making"
This is a laughable take. It should be easier for him to score if he isn’t the defenses focus. Even fucking Royce O’Neal put up 17   Clips will be lucky to get through the mavs and if they do Joe ingles will make pg13% his son again lmao
He doesn't want to face Joe Ingles in the second round.
"Joe Ingles will neutralize KD and Kyrie at the same time, while Mitchell, Conley and Bogdanovic triple team Harden, and Rudy just waits for anyone to dare drive to the rim. Easy clap."
Joe “Goat” Ingles
Imagine if Lillard had Joe Ingles UNGHHHH
Joe ingles doesn’t touch it enough
"Dillon Brooks, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Javale Magee  I omitted former Sixers because there’s a few, but dammit I’m still gonna say TJ McConnell"
Open looks - Joe Ingles by the largest of margins  Difficult shots - Dame   Absolutely No Bias
Clippers don’t make it passed Utah in the 2nd round. Joe Ingles gonna have Paul George in purgatory
"No.  Cause we had max cap space for Free Agents in 2018, and 2016.  Durant and LeBron were free agent in 2018, didn't sign.  They used the space to absorb other teams bad deals.  In 2017 Joe Ingles turned down big money from the Nets to resign with the Jazz."
The correct answer is Joe Ingles
Caruso Reddick Ingles Joe Harris Duncan Robinson Steven Adams Olynyk McConnell etc
"Go watch the OKC-Jazz series if you want to see how Paul George does against Gobert you casual.  Your boy put up 5 points on 16 shots in 45 minutes in an elimination game, more turnovers than points.  A completely pathetic game after a series long meltdown from a dude who is so bad at facing adversity that he can't handle sharing a court with Joe Ingles.  *That* is your second best player?  At least OKC had a third star, is Zubac supposed to be your Carmelo or something?  Your knowledge of basketball is as bad as your fan fic."
PG will not feast with Joe Ingles on the other side
"I’d say it’s pretty even. Jazz took the series 2-1 this year although Clippers weren’t healthy for one of their losses. Each game was within single digits and went back and forth the entire time.  Big X Factor is PG13, who has been notoriously inconsistent against Utah. He’ll either have a career game or get locked down by Joe Ingles whenever we play."
Yes.  The Nets have been in Brooklyn for 9 years.  They whiffed on every free agent.  They couldn't get guys like Joe Ingles out of Utah with big money (in 2017).
" Along with Joe Harris, Frank Kaminsky, Grayson Allen, TJ McConnell, Duncan Robinson, Joe Ingles, Tyler Herro, Myles Leonard, Cody Zeller, Gordon Hayward. LOVE those guys. First team all class."
Exactly. When has it ever *not* been Joe Ingles?
"C'mon now, we all know its STILL Joe Ingles"
Cus Joe Ingles needs something to do after he retires. Haha jk. Idk. Idc. I think we should get a latino in there. A real firecracker.
"Thought about this. I want RJ and Draymond, but I also thought of three other names that might work in this dynamic.  You'd have to screen test personalities as I don't know how the egos mesh.  JJ Redick, CJ McCollum, Joe Ingles. They might all be in the right age range depending on when we lose ITN guys. They all seem like natural media performers (or better, experienced through other formats).  I could see CJ wanting to go down the Aldridge route and wanting to be a reporter though. JJ for Ernie maybe - slightly more edgy due to his white Duke villain past.  Dray already is a Shaq sub somehow, and RJ would be a great Kenny sub. Chuck is hard to replace, but if you replace that southern accent with someone that works (Channing? Jingles? Some sort of Channing Frye/Jayson Tatum hybrid, although Channing Tatum is a ridiculous name for a media performer - it would never happen, right?), maybe?"
He’s not in Miami or LA tho he’s in Utah a very family centric place. By all accounts he’s made friends with the team and is happy. His kids and Joe Ingles kids play on the same soccer team.
Graduate of the Joe Ingles School of Basketball For Guys who Play Against Miami and Do Other Things Good Too.   :(
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
Joe Ingles’ ball fake makes it seem like people aren’t even trying to defend his layups
Is this even a question? It's Joe Ingles with no doubt.
"We have dad-dicked Paul George twice in the playoffs. If we can stick Joe Ingles on you and limit your productivity, you don’t have a claim to being better than our best player. There have been two exceptions to the superstars &gt; systems rule. The ‘14  Spurs and the ‘04 Pistons and our team is built like a genetically modified hybrid of both."
"Homie, Donovan Mitchell’s a beast in the playoffs. My homie Joe Ingles shut down PG years ago in the first round on D... They got a legit chance against the Clippers"
Joe ingles is criminally underrated by anyone who isn’t a jazz fan/doesn’t watch their games
"Hey, that’s “Seventh Man of the Year” Joe Ingles for you"
I would fight Joe Ingles and maybe Kevin Durant
100% chance Joe Ingles takes up temporary residence in George's head.
"I thought joe ingles would end up MVP... so not that one.   Umm, I thought lebron would’ve given in and shaved his head well before now. He truly is determined. #striveforgreatness"
You guys just need a Joe Ingles. It even makes the bad years funnier.
"Joe Ingles says he's 33, but we all know he's 53."
Joe Ingles looks like a middle age physics substitute teacher
Joe Ingles is hilarious my dude. The legend

You forgot Joe Ingles
Dawg I get to see joe ingles vs PG again it’s lit p
Bro this kids a clown. Joe Ingles and Clarkson might be better than Balding Trae and the wannabe Bojan
Average Joe Ingles fan
Joe Ingles caused all of this.
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
Joe Ingles has been non-existent this game.
joe ingles  he's cold and heartless with his incessant Jingling
"This checks out, Lebron has never beaten the Jazz once in the playoffs. Is he dodging Joe Ingles? Probably not but I can’t say for certain."
"Bruh, why did Donovan have to fly 10 feet and Joe Ingles had to point it out to the ref before they blew the whistle and made a call????   Hello??"
"OP beat me to post this but I had my title as ""[Highlight] The Clippers play lockdown defence on the crunch time possession but Joe Ingles steps up and knocks down a clutch 3 ball"""
"Every time I see Joe Ingles I just imagine his daily life   “So what do you do for work?”  I’m an NBA star on a playoff contender   “Ahahahaha, good one, no really”  …..google me   “… so you’re like… REALLY hot”"
Joe Ingles is an inspiration. I'll have his hairline in 5 years
I'd give anything to hear Doris Burke call Joe Ingles one of the greatest shit-talkers on national televison

"way too much credit to their editors lol. it would be like ""Joe Ingles: Paul George annoys 'the hell out of me'."""

"Joe ""accounting professor"" Ingles"
But the Suns don't have a Joe Ingles and that is why the Jazz will win their first championship.
"I mean yeah, Ingles lives rent free in Pandemic P's head, there is no vs, Joe is the Dominatrix and PG13 is the sub."
When you have a kid my current company buys you 6 two hour maid sessions to clean whatever in your house you want. I really gotta figure out how to make as much as Joe Ingles cuz damn someone just showing up and cleaning my house is amazing.
1.	Joe Ingles (and it isn’t even close) The rest of these players are scrubs in comparison
"i feel like everybody and their dog have gotten torched by a luke kennard. white dude running around non-stop with a shit haircut hitting every fuckin midranger. annoying as fuck.  joe ingles is that mf dad at the rec literally can't run the length of the court but for some reason you can't get by him, he steals the ball from you with quickest hands you ever seen, and he reads you and your friends like a book on offense. doesn't even look like he's trying, in fact it looks like he's trying to do fancy shit all the time and it's even more annoying"
And one is autistic. Joe and Renae Ingles are major promoters of autism awareness. That family’s wholesomeness frequently makes me mist up.
The new narrative is whether Luke Kennard can supplant Joe Ingles as the dopiest looking dude who will still torch the other team.
"""Yo, don’t you ever compare me to Paul George again. Don’t you ever do that."" --Joe Ingles"

I legit love Joe Ingles. Especially because of his advocacy for autism awareness (my bro is autistic).
Joe Ingles
Does anyone have a link to Joe Ingles’ player intro like the one listed in OP? I’ve heard it’s hilarious
Every team could use a teammate like Joe Ingles if only for moments like these and the locker room presence. The on court skills are like the cherry on top. And the memes... oh god
"Whenever i play joe ingles on 2k, i just pull up on the fastbreak 3 and hit it, and then imagine mike breen saying JINGLE BELLS, or MERRY CHRISTMAS in his usual BANG tone."
"People who like Joe Ingles.   He’s not depressed, mate."
That is the correct response to Joe Ingles.
Iguodala DEFINES that role for me over the past few seasons. He was an amazing contributor on the Warriors without the need to steal the limelight. Stepped up when needed and always positively contributed.  I definitely think Joe Ingles should have won it this year too. He filled that role beautifully for the Jazz this season.
You spelled Joe Ingles wrong
"Which is why Joe Ingles didn’t win. Take the whole season into account and Ingles was quite a bit better than Clarkson. And as far as how many games he started, I think being the first person inserted into the starting line up when someone’s missing only strengthens your case."
I suppose Joe also like ingles
Joe Ingles gonna pop off for 45 a game against the Nets and play lockdown defence on KD.
Yea and he's been owning Joe Ingles since that series when hes guarded him. We keep that to ourselves though.    Every son outgrows their father at some point. its a beautiful thing.
&gt; There's two types of people in this world: those who like Joe Ingles and ~~those who got jingled~~ Paul George.  FTFY
There's two types of people in this world: those who like Joe Ingles and those who got jingled.
Joe Ingles is a national treasure
how can you not love joe ingles
"""*Wouldn't be able to do it without you guys.*"" - Rudy Gobert  ""*We know.*"" - Joe Ingles"
He’s better than Joe Ingles and Royce O’Neale
For me the biggest thing is that instead of Miye Oni coming off the bench it's Joe Ingles.   The starters will be fine with Joe but the bench unit can struggle to get the offense going without him running it
"Jazz missed 21 straight shots or something, were missing Conley, Joe Ingles played bad, Mitchell played bad first half yet still won."
Yes... Joe ingles has 5 points in the 3 games prior to yesterday. Him playing poorly isnt some magically new thing   Royce had 8 points... consistent with his season average of 7 ppg   I’m sorry your feelings are hurt as a jazz fan that I think the clippers will win the series. I just have no idea how you’re going to get over it
Reminds me of the way Joe Ingles moves too.  Surreal watching Joe move at 2 MPH yet somehow stay in front of a ball handler.
"This hate goes back way longer than the last year, this is entirely because PG decided to crown himself with a nickname (tacky as fuck) after a single playoff game win (cocky as fuck) against the Jazz in 2018 before completely shitting the bed and getting wrecked by a rookie and Joe Ingles (embarrassing as fuck).  This rivalry has been entirely based on PG's choices which makes it fun.  They don't just hate Paul George for being Paul George, they mock him for thinking he's Jordan. There's a level of pity somewhere in there too I think because Paul George is pitiful when he plays the Jazz."
Someone finally puts Joe Ingles in his proper tier
"Using CBS rankings only taking American players ranked 75 or after could field a team of   PG: Derick White, Pat Bev  SG: Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry  SF: Joe Ingles, Mikel Bridges, Otto Porter  PF: PJ Tucker, Jerami Grant  C: Kevin Love  &amp;#x200B;  Team would get wrecked by the American # 1 Team, but its not bad"
joe ingles is likeable too
Joe Ingles a bum  &amp;#x200B;  Quin is not a good coach
yeah I'd rather have Joe Ingles out there because at least he isn't a black hole on offense that fucks up spacing.
Would you rather play notable perimeter defenders like Bojan or Joe Ingles out their.  They have no options.  Outside of Gobert all of their defensive players suck.  Royce is average at best.
Good thing Joe ingles injured the best player in the world
Who’s the cutest player on the Jazz? Has to be tied between Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson right?
"Naw, it's Joe Ingles /s"
Joe Ingles simply radiates sexy dad bod energy
Real Aussies love Joe Ingles anyway
The obvious answer is Joe Ingles and Michael Jordan
"Is Joe Ingles the best Aussie player all time? I’d say so, although Bogut had higher potential if his body wasn’t made of glass"
Do I get to cheer when Joe ingles gets injured now too?
Don't act like we didn't all watch Joe Ingles literally put Kawhi in the figure 4 and just kept leaning back until Kawhi's knee exploded like a rotten grapefruit!  Joe Ingles is a fucking menace to the NBA and I can't belive Adam Silver is just letting it happen.
"My prediction for Jazz/Clippers today if Mitchell and Conley are both benched:  It's late in the 4th. There's only a few minutes left to go. All hope has been extinguished and everything is silent in the Staples Center. Joe Ingles explodes for yet another monster dunk over Reggie Jackson, bringing the Jazz total to 130 to a pitiful Clippers total of 61 and his own total for the night to 70-25-20. Jackson's goggles are blown off from the force of the dunk and shatter on the ground. Kawhi cries silently from the bench. Paul George is in the hospital undergoing emergency surgery for a class 4 Jingling he received in the 1st. It's not clear if he'll pull through.  With the lead safely secured and only 3:05 left, the Jazz bring Ingles back to the bench and send out Niang. Clippers win, Jazz are eliminated."
"“Highlight: after INJURING kawhi, Joe ingles WRECKLESSLY runs near a player THE NEXT PLAY.”"
“It was reckless and DIRTY that Joe ingles bumped knees with kawhi.”
"Josh smith HOU lit us up one of those years. So did Joe ingles and Joe johnson UTA. They wrecked us. Ofcourse Blake and CP got injured. Cant win with DJ, JJ redick, Jamal crawford, matt barnes, lance stephenson, austin rivers, Cole Aldrich, and more that i cant remember just now"
Joe Ingles most definitely doesn't approve
Now they got bitchboy all-pro wanker joe ingles jackknifing him on defense.  The only way they can stop him is through cheap shots and trying to injure him.
They still have the GOAT Joe Ingles though
"You have Joe Ingles, stop complaining."
"He load managed due to lingering injuries. He had to increase the load when Don went down and got hurt again.  Jazz need to get a solid backup PG that's not just Joe Ingles, so we can give both Conley and Joe reasonable rest.  Also getting some sizeable athletic defenders wouldn't hurt"
Joe Ingles lost a son last night
If Beverley did this shit he'd be called a lowlife dirty crackhead.... I wonder why it's different with scrappy classy Joe Ingles 🤔
His best coaching move was probably telling Joe Ingles to injure Kawhi.

He's playing like Joe Ingles but without any scoring at all
Joe Ingles lost a son tonight
"Playoff P and Joe Ingles, name a more iconic archrivals"
"This defeat it me hard. Both team played great basketball, I thought we had them after 3 quarters, but then Australia came out with big D, rebounding and freaking Joe Ingles hitting 3s after 3s...  Don't know if this very same problems may appear again with Nigera, as they are very big."
"If someone said close your eyes and imagine international basketball, Joe Ingles is the picture that would come in to your mind."
joe ingles is the basketball player of all time
Did Joe Ingles attempt a shot that quarter?
"""Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Josh Richardson, Landry Shamet, Aaron Holiday, and a variety of picks are being dangled in trades talks.""  With all due respects to those players, no player goes from untouchable to ""Landry Shamet's available; let's test it out!""   Keep in mind the organization we're talking about. They pissed away a dynasty with KD/Westbrook/Harden because they *might* (and turns out wouldn't have) gone into the luxury tax by resigning him. Shai's getting $100+ million after this coming season. OKC is far from being good and have confused themselves with an NFL team where a bunch of mid-to-late-first-round draft picks actually are worth more than a star player."
"I get Holiday, Shamet, Josh Richardson. But why Joe Ingles and Bojan?"
"Did anyone else read the title as “okc called det to offer shai and 6 for #1 pick, bojan bogdonovic, Joe ingles, Josh Richardson….”  I was shocked Detroit wanted ingles and more shocked Utah said no."
"Yes, he is better than Bryn Forbes by a pretty good margin at this point in their careers , that isnt worth energy. Joe Harris is a good comp, Buddy is marginally better (Buddy is asked to do more than he should be doing and is taking 4 more 3PA a game than Joe), and he is marginally payed more than Joe is. A lot of these guys take hometown discounts to win a title. A guy like Joe Ingles could get paid 3-4 more a year if he wanted to play on a less loaded team. JJ Reddick made 23 million in 2017 for putting up Hield like numbers. When that immediately fell off he regressed to a lower tiered mean (to be fair he was nearing the end of his prime that season alone)."
Joe Ingles bandage killed them.
I don't think Demar even fixes the the scoring problem when Lebron sits because Demar would start. So would Westbrook. The Lakers need an actual 6th man like Joe Ingles.
"I don't think the problem is those guys not knowing their roles tbf, it's that guys like Lillard and KD are scared to be ball dominant. It feels like everyone's trying to be accomodating and that's stopping any actual organization or hierarchy from forming.   If Dame wants to take 20 shots, Tatum or LaVine isn't going to give a shit.   Like, you said Holiday fit well because he was used to his role from the Bucks, but Holiday ended up taking the most shots on the team vs France.   Team USA feels like a bunch of guys that are afraid to take ownership. Whether that's as a result of something Pop's telling them or because we're all just afraid of stepping on each other's toes, I have no idea, but that was pretty clearly the biggest issue, and what separates Team USA from these other international teams atm.  Australia knows Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are gonna take 15+ shots every game no matter what, France knows Fournier's gonna take 15+shots every game no matter what, Slovenia knows Luka's going to take 20+ shots every game no matter what.   Team USA goes into games and has no expectations for anyone and tries to play around whoever has the hot hand, and if no one's particularly hot, they literally have no consistency offensively."
They should just play on a court which is a giant ad screen. 48 minutes of ads during the game. Bonus points in game if players are caught on mic singing jingles.  Also bonus points for being a jingle. Joe Ingles MVP for this reason.
To hammer this point home he’s the perfect combination of a coked out Patty Mills in Australia competition and the sweet shooting of Joe Ingles. This would be great for Memphis and  if they can find a trade partner for Anderson
Why lol? Bouknight and Kuminga are considered much better prospects. The most popular draft comp for Giddey has been Joe Ingles without the shooting.
"There is decent amount of players with FIBA experience, and some with the Euroleague (which is by far best competition with FIBA rules outside of National competitions) like Joe Ingles who played 4 years of Euroleague basketball before coming to NBA etc... Luka played 3 seasons of Euroleague I think, or 2 full seasons."
"Joe Ingles, on his 28th birthday."
How will he accelerate past Joe Ingles?
Joe fucking Ingles
"Gobert had the highest PER on the Jazz and had almost double the win shares over any other player on the team except Joe Ingles. Since he also carried the French team to a victory over ""leagues ahead"" guys like Booker, KD, and Dame, I'd say that makes a pretty compelling argument that he makes a big difference."
"My reasoning is. a) He is returning after missing 3/4 of last season and after like 2-3 games with the boomers it's takes time to know where your team mates are on the court, b)this game was very physical and disjointed for all the players see Joe Ingles and Baynes they struggled with the physicality  in the key all night     Another thing is Dante is 6,6 long and has a high center of gravity so he can move fast and lose balance easily"
I don't know basketball well/at all.   Is Joe Ingles having a poor game? His 3 early 3s were great but since then he's just driving at the basket and turning it over.
Joe Ingles is the best shooter Australia has seen since Ned Kelly
Only question is is Joe Ingles going for 50 or 60 this game
Joe Ingles or Derrick Favors. They both have kids and seem like really good dads.
Joe Ingles and/or Georges (pronounced George) Niang in Utah.  Funny mutha fuckazz!
"We rock with the Aussies regardless. Obviously we want the US to win gold, but Patty Mills a monster and Joe Ingles a meme legend over here. Hopefully we’ll both be up on that podium together."
A major injury caused by a bullshit play by Joe Ingles don't forget that part
Joe ingles ingles being the best example of course
Joe ingles
It blows my mind that CJ Miles and Joe Ingles are both 33.
It's kind of sad that it took this long for me to realize Joe Ingles is Australian.
So much great Aussie content haha  Dunlop Volleys  Joe Ingles not giving high-fives to certain guys  Players singing to [Slim Dusty](https://youtu.be/hOML9zwoZn0)  Patty fuckin Mills  and of course bulk shit-talking
Javale is going to need to find a star to follow because Joe Ingles is such a great content generator for Matisse.
And for a significant stretch of time was the 3rd most accurate 3 point shooter behind Joe ingles and Joe Harris. He also had a really bad slump early in the season and if you adjust that it was probably more around 42%
"Westbrook far above anyone else. He cares too much not to have one. Besides him, Ricky Rubio, Mike Conley, Joe Ingles for obvious reasons, Wes Matthews."
"Your points are good but you arguing with someone who couldnt even read to see if I was referring to Lonzo's 3 point shot, which is a sign your just gonna be engaging with someone who's only interested in acting in bad faith. But yes, Lonzo doesnt have real gravity that affects defenses, teams were fine with putting guys like Giannis on him to play free safety to help off him and let him chuck.   It's also pretty clear in his career splits in the month of Feb every yr he shoots like Joe Ingles and for every other month of his career he's a mediocre shooter."
"Ok, since no one else has taken the bait yet: ty lue was saying 3 of the 4 best teams in the nba(one of whom hadn’t been determined yet at the time of him saying it, as Philly and Atlanta hadn’t played game 7 yet) were black men.   Also Joe ingles flair"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"Joe Ingles, is that you?"
The defensive moment that may go un-celebrated here is joe ingles’ strategic off ball bump on kawhi. That’s Bball IQ: disruption
I think they go to Joe Ingles as a primary ball handler when the bench comes in. Clarkson only gets it if he has a mismatch or off the catch when the ball is moving. They should go to Joe tho if Clarkson is cold that game.
"All I know is that I would bring a sign of Joe Ingles holding his child, Paul George."
Joe Ingles played some good defense last night but he’s been in a shooting slump the entire playoffs. They need him to get it going
There’s actually a pretty simple 3 step program if you’d like to become an official Jazz fan.  1. Say “Fuck the Rockets”  2. Say “Jordan pushed off”  3. Accept Joe Ingles as your Lord and Savior  Do that and you’re in.
I didn't watch the game but if PG got clamped by joe Ingles then he deserves it. If Ingles wasn't his primary defender then disregard.
"it looked to me like neither were in a good position. both Ingles and Kawhi tripped over each other and stumbled. by the time Kawhi recovered, Ingles had gotten in front of him with both hands up. he couldn't beat Joe off the dribble either, so he had to give it up."
"I dont understand what’s fun about voting for something obviously stupid and outta left field. It’s a waste of time, and could potentially ruin a historic moment for legendary players.  Imagine if some booger-eating assholes took away Steph’s unanimous MVP because they thought it was hilarious to vote for Joe Ingles."
"It’s as if you’re forgetting the shot was blocked.   Your argument would be perfect if it was the classic lebron case of passing to a teammate and he just missed. No. It was blocked. And not by Joe ingles, or Bogdonovich, or some surprise play. It was Rudy mfin Gobert. That plays into the decision making.   So you ask would I want Kawhi taking a contested ‘bad’ shot. YES. Rudy Gobert with one foot in the paint means that man is not open. That ending was predictable"
"Wait until the Jazz have a first half where they don't have a 0/21 shooting streak. Unlike Kawhi and PG, Mitchell shows up every game (even if it takes him a bit to get going sometimes).  And don't forget that Conley, arguably the 3rd best player on the Jazz (behind our #1 Joe Ingles and our #2 Joe Ingles) is out."
"Okay, but Ingles was PG's primary defender that series, so it's not unfair that the takeaway from that game 6 was that Ingles shut him down.  Realistically, if you want people to respect PG, he needs to just play better in the playoffs against the Jazz. Till then, the memory everyone will have of him is going 2/16, then 4/17 tonight. Arguing that memes aren't exactly accurate won't do anything to fix his habit of underperforming while playing on the same court as Joe Ingles."
joe ingles is a bad motherfucker i tell you what
SOMETHING (joe ingles) about utah
Joe ingles reading this like 0\_\_\_\_0
Joe ingles has entered the mind of Paul George.
Don't forget about Joe Ingles with a wet fart on their faces
"Joe Ingles' defence was great in this play as well, held PG down then came in to help Gobert out."
"Bruh you coming at a guy super hard when you aren’t even right... Kawhi stepped back and elected not to shoot cause of joe Ingles good defense. Since he knew Kawhi needed a 3. So he’s lost his dribble and either Kawhi is gonna have to reload and shoot an off balance 3 with no momentum, or he sees Morris’s man with a foot in the paint. It’s literally the right play. Good defense and Morris could have done better maybe. How are you gonna say Morris was equally covered as Kawhi lol that just shows you weren’t even looking"
"To piggyback off this, Australia (if all their players show) has a really solid rotation. Ben Simmons, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes, and Dante Exum is a solid group of NBA players. They also have other notables like Mitch Creek, Ryan Broekhoff, Thon Maker."
Joe Ingles
Does playing Joe Ingles really affect Paul George that much?
Only the stars can make them. Like joe ingles is ass from 3 but guys like ja can knock them down. I miss when you could have good games with randos. Now it’s just get a star and only shoot with them. Badges went too far
"Joe Ingles is a guy that can get you a bucket, and a guy that can stop you from getting a basket, I don't see how you can beat that"
I mean that’s what happens when your playing you dad joe ingles
Mavs don’t have Joe ingles
Nah he just ain’t gonna fuck with Jinglin Joe Ingles
The Joe Ingles Playoff P memes are going to be so good
His dad Joe Ingles is taking care of him tonight
He can’t handle Joe ingles
What the fuck is Greg Anthony talking about Joe Ingles not being able to pass??? lol
Joe Ingles is his kryptonite
I thought it was just a meme at first but I’m convinced PG is genuinely terrified of Joe Ingles lol
He always plays this way when his dad Joe Ingles is on the court
People talk about Scottie Bron and Bruce bowen but Joe Ingles vs PG is the best perimeter defender I've ever seen
Do you not know who Joe Ingles is
Joe Ingles I guess lol  PG and PL both rocking 13 for a reason
PG is simply getting nervous cause his father joe ingles is at the game
Joe Ingles and Bogdanovic look so similar lol
If the Jazz win do yall think PG is gonna excuse his poor play by saying Jazz fans and Joe Ingles is affecting his mental health like last year?
I think the Joe Ingles memes got to him.
Joe Ingles is his kryptonite
Joe Daddy Ingles
Some reason? You mean his father Joe ingles?
Joe Ingles owns Paul George
Joe Ingles wrong for this one
"I find it outrageous that Joe Ingles does not have any commercials on air in Aussie TV. This man is the face of Australia, not that fraud Ben Simmons"
I was not aware how much people fucking hate Joe Ingles but it's funny af
Joe Ingles looks like he picks his kids up from school and asks them “who wants ice cream!”
I absolutely can not stand Joe Ingles
"maybe not showing ingles beefing with rondo? joe is fucking with them, how he pushed kenard after a whistle and luke said dont do that man"
Clippers legend joe ingles. Wish doc would've given him a chance
Luke looked like Joe Ingles son
yay paul george's father joe ingles has entered the court
Gonna be wild when Joe Ingles dicks Paul George again.
One of my favourite playoff matchups ever is having a rematch tonight. Paul George vs Jinglin Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles is going to father some children in this series
All this talent just to stop Joe Ingles
Oh boy joe Ingles is go off isn't he
I’m thoroughly excited to see how Joe “Toby Flenderson” Ingles gets in PG’s head this series
Imagine the luxury of missing your all star point guard and still having Joe Ingles
International kings winning MVP - can’t wait to see Joe Ingles next 👉🏼👈🏼
Can't wait to see Paul George get owned by Joe Ingles again later on.
so joe ingles and alex caruso died?
I think Klay would be close to what he is because Klay is one of the greatest shooters ever and was an elite perimeter defender. I think you’re underselling by comparing to Joe Ingles (lol) or Booker (completely different game).
"Clippers would have Kawhi/Luka so probably the two best players on the floor.  Utah would then have Donovan and Gobert  Clippers would have Paul George  Name a single Clipper who is better than the following list of players  Ja Morant  Mike Conley  Bojan Bogdanovic  Joe Ingles  Jeremy Clarkson  Derrick Favors  Royce O'Neale  Maybe the Clippers 4th best player is as good as Royce, but Utah would be WAAAAAAAY deeper.  It's not bias, its just Utah has a deeper squad and we'd be adding Ja in the mix in this hypothetical."
"Hotter take: Klay and Dray wouldn't be stars (and hence not 'help') without Steph.   Outside of KD every player that leaves GSW during the Curry era falls off an huge offensive cliff.  In all honesty Klay is the one I struggle with the most, he could be another Booker or Joe Ingles."
Nice joe ingles get to start against his son now
We just ignoring Rudy Gobert/Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles as defenders?  The Jazz bench would be super deep dude. Luka/PG/Kawhi can't play 48 minutes a game.  And why are you acting like Rondo isn't a playmaker?
I'd love a Joe Ingles and Georges Niang commentary duo for the Jazz
"The great part about the Joe Ingles meme is that it triggers opposing fans in to thinking we're being absolutely serious every time.   You've let yourself get Jingled, buddy."
"Similarly, Joe Ingles is almost certainly gonna start in place of Conley for the Jazz in at least game 1, which gives the Jazz 2 undrafted starters and drops their highest drafted starter to 13"
"1. Why the hell is no one contesting vuc if he's a 41% 3pt shooter?  2. Looks like kuz needs to stop taking contested 3s  3. Very impressive from Joe Ingles, almost no drop on contests despite shooting 45%..."
We are a better team with Conley starting don’t be ridiculous. Joe Ingles is a better player when he’s starting though
Joe Ingles causes PG some problems
Joe Ingles is starting now… PG about to have flashbacks of 2017. (In all reality this sucks ass)
Which means Joe Ingles will now be a starter.  Welcome to Paul George's nightmare.
"Yeah said this back in February when they played matchup in general no bueno for Utah. Bet on LAC yesterday.   --Rudy Gobert not gonna be able to exploit and punish LAC for playing so much Morris at the 5.   --Utah is one wing defender shorter tbh for a Paul George/Kawhi lineup. Joe ingles is also 3 yrs older now than when he handled his son PG last time   --LAC switching alot is the type of thing that can neutralize alot of the actions Utah runs. Not the same type of motion offense you saw in the past but there is still some of that and in particular rely a ton on Gobert as a screener which teams have switched in the past to neutralize alot of their actions.   --- Too many defenders LAC will hunt and that's the type of thing they do. Kawhi was hunting Donovan when they played in the reg season. Bojan will get targeted. Jordan Clarkson definitely will also. Makes it easier for LAC   ---Like the article talks about Utah is built around taking away the rim, not something that really changes how LAC plays alot.   ---Solid LAC matchups across the board for Utah perimeter players. PG's length can get over the Conley pick and rolls make it harder for him to get off especially those floaters. Batum/Kawhi can do fine on Mitchell/Clarkson."
CP3 is still in his prime at 35. He's the catalyst of making Syns into a title contender and will get an All-NBA selection.  The likes of Joe Ingles &amp; Blake Griffin are players who are past their prime.
Joe Ingles
Russell Westbrook  Joe Ingles  Jae Crowder  Michael Porter Jr  Myles Turner
I’ll raise you a Royce O Neale and Joe Ingles as well
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."
"While I don’t think Thibs is undeserving, many players in Snyder’s system would not operate as well without him. Royce O’Neale, Georges Niang, Joe Ingles and others thrive in this system but I believe would have minimal success elsewhere. I could see them drop substantially with a league average coach"
Joe Ingles is definitely one of my favorite players to watch because of everything aforementioned. Can’t wait for his beef with PG to start again haha
Man I’m 26 so never seen Jordan play live but it’s so weird when people try to claim someone’s a goat when they’ve seen highlights. You can only judge from what’s in front of you which is why I know Joe Ingles is the goat.
Let's not forgive 3 years ago when Joe Ingles played great defense on Paul George overall.
We talkin about the same paul george that allowed joe ingles to live rent free in his head?
"Joe ingles is still really underrated. One of the best 3pt shooters, super efficient, makes good decisions, and plays great defense.  People talk about him as a meme more than his actual skill"
"Overreliance on athleticism combined with nonexistent boxing out instincts and poor defensive rebounding effort.   I know the Pelicans are a good rebounding team and as long as one of his teammates gets the rebound then that's a team success, but Zion doesn't even box out. If you check the NBA.com boxout stats, his defensive boxout numbers are more like a guard and pretty terrible for a big. Players with more defensive boxouts per minute: Duncan Robinson, James Harden, Joe Ingles.  On offense, aggressively going after rebounds means the potential for more points. There's nothing flashy about getting defense boards."
"Joe Ingles, he about to ruin PG's year"
"Jazz may not have Luka, but we have 9 scoring options and better defense. I'm not understating the Clippers, but if they can tale Clippers to 7 games with 1 man doing all the heavy lifting, I think round 2 will be quite different. Also, Joe Ingles makes PG shrink. We'll have to see who wins because who the fuck knows at this point?"
Maybe Joe ingles can help him?
"&gt;Luka is 100% surrounded by shooters man.  No, he's not. Inconsistent players who make 60% of their attempts one day and 25% another aren't shooters. Bogdan, Bojan, Ingles, Gallo, Joe Harris, Bertans. Seth- these guys are shooters.  &gt;They were 3rd in percentage and 5th in attempts for the playoffs coming into tonight  Horrible sample size. They were 18th in percentage in the 72 game regular season."
Joe Ingles is a sexy man
"Is there any other answer aside from Joe ""thunder down under"" ingles ?"
You forgot Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles would taunt him mercilessly.
"biasedly disagree with that. i want to go through jj, joe ingles doc cut him, then cp3/austin rivers and jymchal, and finally blake and dj/or lou/gallo or tobias/doc"
One thing about the Jazz is the only wing defender that can actually work with Kawhi and Paul is Joe Ingles
Joe Ingles tf   \#joeinglesforpresidentoftheworld
Royce O'Neal is the answer to Kawhi. Not stopping of course but slowing him down. Joe Ingles made Paul George his bitch last time they played. The Jazz are not just a Mitchell team. They have shooters everywhere.
"Yes, considering Joe Ingles just had one of the most efficient seasons of all time for a guard, and Jordan Clarkson averaged 18 ppg. Is that not scary to have coming off the bench?"
Yes. Conley is his second best option. Clarkson was cooking off the bench but he’s cooled down somewhat. Bojan is a great shooter also. Gobert is like a better Clint Capela. Royce O Neal is going to have his hands full with Kawhi and PG. I’m not sure if Joe Ingles can contain Kawhi. If the Clippers decide to go small or run Ibaka I think they can go 5 out and run Gobert off the floor and that will give the Jazz serious problems since he’s they’re defensive anchor.
I cant wait to watch joe ingles destroy PG again
The Paul George Redemption Chapter 1: The Mavs (Complete)   Chapter 2: Joe Ingles
"He's playing against his father, Joe Ingles, and has playoff ghosts from 2018."
PG revenge vs Joe Ingles?
Get ready for the Paul George / Joe Ingles match up.
Joe Ingles and can’t wait for him to complain on every foul call lol
Never mind Kawhi vs Donovan.  The *real* entertainment value of Jazz-Clippers is going to be Joe Ingles vs Paul George.
Joe Ingles. Hands down.
Joe Ingles would like a word
Lebron-KD-Kawhi-Joe Ingles?
Joe Ingles legit an iron man for the Jazz. That doughy ass white body is invincible.
Where is Joe Ingles?
That title belongs to Joe Ingles
I can't stand Joe Ingles
"Joe Ingles is below league average on off the dribble and contested, try again"
"Yeah, and Joe Ingles is a better shooter than Steph Curry. I mean look at the percentages, it must be true!! Figured a Steph fan would understand the influence of degree of difficulty when considering shooting percentages. Guess there are brainless nimrods in every fanbase, though."
I want to live in a universe where joe ingles is finals mvp
Player: Mike Conley - a great guy  Team: Jazz - one of the best winning record % franchises in their entire time in the NBA but haven't quite got over the hump (thanks MJ!)  They are also a team built via the draft and have cultivated a great team culture and they also have Joe Ingles
Jingled - the feeling you get after being graced from the GOAT Joe Ingles
"Nope, not even the 7th a.k.a. Joe Ingles!"
If Joe Ingles gets inside PG's head we're screwed
Jazz don’t have a top 5-7 superstar lmao guess you haven’t watched joe ingles play
Nah it was joe ingles
"He’s Joe Ingles, can’t you read"
We don’t like to think about soldiering through the Nets and Sixers only to get shot out of the gym by Joe Ingles
"It's not gonna matter if it's small market vs small market, as long as both teams have identifiable superstars that are entertaining to watch. Embiid or Giannis vs Jokic or Luka is gonna be about as popular as LeBron or Kawhi vs Harden and KD. Ratings suck when it's a bunch of good players getting their bucket within the flow of the offense facing off. Casual fans don't want to watch Joe Ingles 3s and be like, ""Well, I could've made those if the passing opened up that much space"". They want to watch superstars do superhuman things and cheer for the heroes facing off against the villains."
