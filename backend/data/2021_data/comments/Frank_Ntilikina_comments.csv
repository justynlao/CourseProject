Frank Ntilikina gets injured in 2019 what happens
top 10 picks Frank Ntilikina &amp; Kevin Knox haven‚Äôt developed much of anything. DSJ got worse since he was traded there.
"So Harden would‚Äôve won a ring if Josh Smith and Dwight Howard were better at basketball? You realize Dwight and Josh Smith bricking free throws wasn‚Äôt exactly out of the ordinary for them, right?  ‚ÄúIf these players who are known for missing shots just didn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôd be different!‚Äù And if Frank Ntilikina were Kobe the Knicks would be a playoff team."
"As somebody well versed in the Frank Ntilikina experience, I can see that Hayes stinks already."
"Obi has barely played because he was hurt.  Hayes is probably out for the year with an injury that could sap the little bit of athleticism he had, and he wasn't good to begin with.  Hayes is Frank Ntilikina if Frank was forced into being a starter for no reason.  Dude is garbage."
"Probably Frank Ntilikina, I still think he would do well on the right team, but an offensively below average point guard is a hard sell."
He's better than or comparable to:      DJ Augustin   Reggie Jackson     Tre Jones   Yogi Ferrell   Tim Frazier   Dellavedova   Quinn Cook   Chris Clemons   MCW   Brad Wannamaker   Jeff Teague   Dennis Smith Jr   Ish Smith  Cameron Payne   Frank Ntilikina   Raul Neto      go fuck yasself
Uhh... I would bet on it. Never heard of anyone buying frank ntilikina and RJ Barrett jerseys
"I feel like New York is still a team that would take a chance on Kyrie. What about something like this?:  * HOU receives: Caris LeVert, Julius Randle, Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Brazdeikis, BKN 2021 1st Rounder, BKN 2023 1st Rounder, BKN 2025 1st Rounder, 2022 Pick Swap with BKN, 2024 Pick Swap with BKN, NYK 2021 1st Rounder  * BKN receives: James Harden, PJ Tucker  * NYK receives: Kyrie Irving  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=y4ye7wuc  Brooklyn doesn't completely gut their roster and retains depth but they have no draft picks to trade for 5 years. New York gets a top 8 PG (when he plays) without giving up a core piece like RJ or Robinson. Houston gets younger good upside players who can contribute immediately or can be flipped for more picks.   Thoughts?"
Thybulle is a less handsome Frank Ntilikina
in other words Frank Ntilikina
Poor KD. Really chose to play with Kyrie over Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilikina
Getting serious Frank Ntilikina vibes from this description
imo frank ntilikina is the most misunderstood superstar in NBA history

"i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs rooting for him to get hurt, i think he‚Äôs being realistic.   for example, i love Frank Ntilikina, but this damn sure won‚Äôt be his last injury of the season"
"Obviously its not fun no matter what, but it's better than another year of complete apathy towards your team knowing that you won't be competitive this year and have no path to contention in the immediate future- all the while watching your fan base get excited by simply doing nothing, irrationally attaching themselves to no name rookies, and getting their hopes up by mediocrity only to eventually be let down.  Seriously, if you love basketball there is nothing worse than hour team not only sucking, but having no future and having to just get fake excited about guys like Landry Fields, hold out hope that Frank Ntilikina is going to one day turn into an actual basketball player, and look at Julius Randle memes because he had a hot start."
Don't forget about Frank Ntilikina the year before
"Frank Ntilikina to Orlando for Mo Bamba + 2rp   i love frank but unfortunately don‚Äôt see much of a future for him in NY. he can play 1-2 and conceivably the 3 in a small lineup.   Magic have no use for Bamba, Knicks might be able to use him as Mitch lite and trade Noel at the deadline"
"Granted some of these guys are still respectable NBA players, but I thought they all had All-Star/All-Defense upside at the very least:  Jabari Parker  Nik Stauskas  Nerlens Noel  Kris Dunn  Frank Ntilikina  Terrence Ross  Evan Turner  Perry Jones III"
For me its just how little I even think about frank ntilikina lol
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah‚Äôs bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson‚Äôs doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
All of this with Frank Ntilikina hurt... watch out NBA
Adam Morrison.  Josh Childress.  Dennis Smith Jr.  Frank Ntilikina.
Frank Ntilikina is the most tenured Knick
"In no way saying he's Draymond level, but Ntilikina can develop into this type of player. His impact on the court is always much more than his trash stat lines imply. Maybe I'm just a Frank stan though"
Boston game 6.         I guess his feelings got hurt.          That game against the Knicks when Frank Ntilikina bumped into him and Kanter started talking shit. LeBron proceeded to clamp 7'3 Porzingis and hit the dagger to win the game.
 ( I have a feeling this will get tons of downvotes since y‚Äôall hate the last name Ntilikinaüò≠) I been a Frank fan since he was a frenchman. He is the only reason I watch the knicks otherwise I would disregard that team like me and millions of others do each year. I‚Äôve noticed a couple things since I‚Äôve watched all their games. The players seem jealous of Frank and I‚Äôm assuming they are jealous because 1. He‚Äôs better than most of them and 2. He gets more media attention than all of them combined (rightfully so). His teammates show that jealousy on the court when they don‚Äôt pass to him even if he‚Äôs open (anyone that watches their games can confirm this). They look god awful when frank isn‚Äôt on the court orchestrating the offence. Yet the coach refuses to start him when elfrid payton is struggling with the thought of a star frenchy taking his spot hence his terrible performance. For the knicks to win games they need to hand the keys to the team over to frank but because they are so damn prideful and in denial they keep losingü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"Guys his size with his mobility and his shooting don't exactly grow on trees.  That said, he's one month older than Frank Ntilikina, who's often described as a bust.   MPJ is obviously a lot better than Frank (duh), but he's no raw 19 year old--he just had some gruesome injuries and is now healthy enough to contribute."
"RJ Barrett, Frank Ntilikina and 2 seconds."
i brought up Kemba because Frank Ntilikina embarassed him on the international stage and he doesn‚Äôt deserve to have a roster spot after that.

"Now before you clown us, I think this is a good basketball decision. When Quickley is on the court he needs to just shoot and he can't do that with Randle and RJ taking shots.  also FRANK NTILIKINA REDEMPTION ARC"
"I mean, he isn't the French Prince, but it will do.    #Frank Ntilikina"
"The coaching is a huge part of it for sure. David Fizdale was about as bad as it gets for a head coach. We showed mild improvement when Mike Miller took over, and this team showed it had at least some potential with a competent coach.  Thibs is much more proven than both of those guys for a reason. The Knicks also pumped more resources into improving the coaching staff as a whole. That's also part of it.  Another part of it is that, starting with drafting Ntilikina in 2017, the Knicks have only drafted players with exceptional work ethic with their first round picks. Frank, Knox, RJ, Quickley and Toppin have all been applauded on multiple occasions for putting the extra effort in to improve. Randle said as much last week on JJ Reddick's podcast. They're all young players who care, want to get better, and have high character. Despite all of the losing the last few years, the culture has slowly been shifting for the better. I think we're seeing that pay off this season.  As to your point regarding 3 point shooters... the Front Office added enough options that we at least have one guy who is on from 3 most games to keep our spacing present. Usually its Quickley, Burks, or Bullock (with Rivers and Knox stepping up here and there )...  but even Randle has had some great 3 point shooting nights this season.  There have been a lot of improvements. It's not just one thing"
Trade Frank Ntilikina. He‚Äôs garbage

" &gt;We can‚Äôt just ignore the number of covid absences and injuries the Heat have had  While the Knicks haven't had any covid absences outside of Frank Ntilikina, the first 10 or so games of the season we had 8-9 players active and the rest out with Injury. In those games Randle carried us to wins even with the lacking personnel. If Bam is equally as impactful he should have been able to carry as well"

If Frank Ntilikina got [this poster] (https://www.facebook.com/bleacherreport/videos/1539342966238517/)  on Porzingis to go down he would have gotten a bust outside MSG
"Seeing Knicks brigaders in the Mavs sub saying ""thanks for the lottery pick"" was so obnoxious. These guys usually shut up when you remind them they turned two recent ones into Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilikina who SUCK, so let's see what they do with an even lower one this year."
Top 1 is getting dunked on for not believing Frank Ntilikina is one of the best defenders of our era.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dtr4fb/who_is_more_impactful_as_a_defender_matisse/f6yb3yb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3  That and I‚Äôve seen some ludicrous takes regarding both Pete Maravich and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
"Knicks have suckkkked at drafting since Porzingis.   Obi Toppin over Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin Knox over Shae Gilgious Alexander, Michael Porter Jr and Mikal Bridges  Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo"
"He was actually decent in NY too. Before the KP injury that team was around the 6-seed and the PG's were Jarret Jack and 18 Y/O Frank Ntilikina. The second best player was THJ.  In addition to running a Phil Jackson system, the guy did as well as anybody could. I think at the time I just thought he was meh, but it's clear that you can do much worse. Hornacek is an NBA level head coach even if it's in the middle tier. There are definitely worse coaches out there than him."
"Every fanbase has an attachment to their players, you see it whenever trade rumors happen.   However, there's a difference between being attached to your greatest player ever and Kevin Knox/Frank Ntilikina."

The Frank Ntilikina/Obi Toppin bench unit happened
"- Warriors get: Elfrid Payton  - Knicks get: Brad Wanamaker, Eric Paschall + 2nd round pick  ....... next trade  - Bulls get: Obi Toppin, Kevin Knox, Reggie Bullock, Frank Ntilikina + 2 1st round picks  - Knicks get: Zach Lavine, Tomas Satoransky"
"Payton and Rose were both out.   Frank Ntilikina started but played less than 10 minutes because he wasn't doing much.   Immanuel quickly was the main PG and played with the first and second units.   You gotta remember though that our offense is mostly run by Randle, we use him as a Point Forward because he's got superb passing instincts and ball handling for his size."
Yeah we're starting Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina.

The disrespect to Frank Ntilikina
Believe it or not i think the Knicks were interested in him also Kemba is from New York as well. The Knicks won't offer what they were before but they do have some young talent like Knox and frank ntilikina who are much closer in age to tatum and Brown. Wouldnt be to bad of deal tbh
"Russ, i play like Frank Ntilikina without the defense"
I love what y‚Äôall are doing with this roster. You weren‚Äôt gifted with superstars like frank Ntilikina and Taj Gibson but through hard work you‚Äôve managed to catch up to us. That‚Äôs that mamba mentality if u ask me üíúüíõüíúüíõ
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
"Knicks:  1. Derrick Rose, SS, great defender, sill enough speed, good contender to be a 20/20 guy, maybe will have to be a 2B/3B later in his career if his knees give out 2. Julius Randle, 3B, man is in purely for his offense, average/below average defender 3. RJ Barrett, P, Shohei Ohtani type player, I've seen some nice full court football style passes from him this year 4. Obi Toppin, RF, Hiding him in RF for shaky defense but will definitely make some highlight plays. great athleticism makes him a potential 30/30 guy 5. Mitchell Robinson, 1B, nothing is getting over his head at 1B, massive strike zone is  definitely negative though 6. Immanuel Quickley, LF, I could see him being a plus defender in left, probably more of a put it in play, don't strike out guy on offense. 7. Elfrid Payton, 2B, No chance he hits over the mendoza line but will play gold glove level defense. 8. Frank Ntilikina, CF, great reaction time make him a premier defensive center fielder, his quick hands give him a potential utility role as a middle infielder. 9. Nerlens Noel, C, Gonna hose guys down at second, veteran leader who can call a good game for our young pitcher. Like the 7 and 8 hitters, likely won't do much on offense"
What happened to Frank Ntilikina?
Frank Ntilikina
Lebron knew of ntilikina but never once recommended him. Ntilikina has value on the defensive end. This years just been shit luck. For example Kyrie literally stepped on franks foot while he was standing still and Frank got called for the foul
holy shit you're the guy who's gassing up Ant like he's the second coming of Jesus and you want to clown knicks fans gassing up our own boy on our OWN subreddit? If we say Frank Ntilikina is MVP you're gonna bring that up too?

"Step 1: Show her Frank Ntilikina with braids  Step 2: You no longer have a girfriend, and dont have to worry about this"
Idk if you worded the title correctly but what I do know is:  Derrick Rose - On court: +10.4 Off court: -0.5  Immanuel Quickley - On court: +6.9 Off court: -1.0  Elfrid Payton - On court: -2.0 Off court: +5.1  Come playoffs Derrick Rose should be starting and Payton should probably be out of the rotation with Frank getting 15ish mins. Putting Quckley with Frank allows Frank to cover Quickley's defensive flaws and gives us another shooter to put in the corner rather than Payton who can't shoot at all.  Quickley/Payton - On court: -15.4  Quickley/Ntilikina - On court: +1.9
"I don't know what the hell was going on last night. Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Trae Young, Clint Capella.... everyone got hurt.  Hope Trae's okay. Had he played the whole night there's a very good chance this game has a different result. I thought we were going to have to bust out Frank Ntilikina to at least try and defend him."
"1) FRANK DOESNT GET 20 MINS A GAME LMFAOOOOOO   2) Frank is a defensive player and is averaging just one point than Edwards, who is a scorer   3) Please do not try to argue Frank Ntilikina, who is a legitimately useful player in the NBA, is worse than Edwards, who has been inefficient at best"
"How are Frank Ntilikina, Danilo Gallinari and Frederic Weis doing rn?"
Phil Jackson also said to draft Frank Ntilikina
"Idk man this knicks team may be one of the more wholesome ones in the league right now. RJs got a long term girlfriend, our best player and defacto captain just wants to see his wife and kid after every game, our best rookie loves jesus more than i love lego bionicles, we got DRose in a Master Splinter from TMNT-esque arc, and one of our starters is a champion for trans rights.   But then ofc you have Frank Ntilikina bedding women left and right and dressing like the devil went on vacation in miami making everyone consider a life of damnation just for a slice of that French/Belgian adonis  Writing this was weird"

"The last time he got styled on by Frank Ntilikina, I wouldn't get my hopes up."
"&gt; You think fans are worse because you don't identify as an athlete,  i literalyl played soccer at youth level in brazil with huge crowds on multiple occasions, lol. the level of play was never as relevant to my personal experience as a bunch of grown man threatening to beat me and screaming (the most creative they could come with) personal insults 2 meters from me in the crowds. crazy, huh? playing against a huge hateful crowd gets the adrenaline pumping much more than playing against a top tier team in a library - simple as that.  &gt; Dude, I have professional basketball players in my family, I have known 30 plus d1 players, many of whom played over seas too. College arenas get as loud as those over seas one, too.  americans being excepcionalist and thinking their version of something is the most special, the most hardcore, the one with most pressure, lol. colour me surprised. and your version of the story completely ignores all i mentioned about how those players are coming into the league and europe, in their and their families countries, taking it completely seriously and professionally. nba players that go to europe are taking a downgrade / admitting failure, so from their perspectives, of course they are not going to see it as much pressure. and yes, ""not being good enough"" is a certain type of pressure, but that's not what we were talking about here - luka and giannis are not even close to not being good enough.   &gt;  there is no argument otherwise.  what a shitty way to end a reply, btw - specially since it's pretty fucking clear you are going to argue forever for the sake of arguing and make up stories about dozens of imaginary basketball players that played in europe and talked to you about this subject specifically, just not to give in. and you are a type too common on the internet.  and well, [argue with them](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1895785):  &gt; Nicolas Batum  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in France  I've played EuroLeague games where it gets pretty crazy. Serbia, Turkey, and Greece are the top three in my mind. My first NBA game, I had to play against the Lakers in Staples Center against Kobe (Bryant) - MVP Kobe. **Coach (Nate McMillan) was like, 'You won't be scared to play against Kobe in front of 20,000 people, will you?' I was like, 'Coach, I've played in Greece, in Belgrade ‚Ä¶ this will be nothing compared to that.'**  It's just different. The atmosphere is crazy. Panathinaikos, Partizan Belgrade, Fenerbahce, those places. The first EuroLeague game I ever played in Turkey, they had protection over the benches, and during the timeouts, while my coach was talking, all you could hear was things hitting the shield, like, 'bap, bap, bap.'   &gt; Bogdan Bogdanovic  Current team: Kings Played for teams in Serbia and Turkey  Here (in the NBA), there are lots of fans of individual players. **Over there, it's more about the teams. There are different cultures in every league in every country there. It's unbelievable. The fans there really take it personal, like they are in the games. They are really nervous and mad in the games like the players. But to me, that makes it nice to play there, even on the road. It's a different kind of pressure. You have to experience it for yourself.** For me, I'm used to it, so playing in a game where fans are throwing coins or lighters or phones is nothing new. Over there, it's normal. They're pointing lasers in your face while you shoot free throws.  &gt; Willy Hernangomez  Current team: Hornets Played for teams in Spain  When I was playing for Madrid, we had a EuroLeague game in Turkey. I'll always remember this: That I was warming up before the game, and I lost the ball, and it bounced and rolled all the way to the stands, and I remember, I didn't even think about going to get the ball like here (in the NBA). The fans there are really crazy. You really feel scared sometimes. There's no way here I would feel (scared) like that. The people there really support their teams and you have to respect them, but sometimes they also cross the line.  **There are some arenas here that are really quiet, you don't even notice people are there, so for us (who have played in Europe), not that the NBA is easier because you never want to say easy, but maybe getting used to the crowds there doing everything crazy, makes it easier for us to focus on the game here. Here, we don't even have to pay attention to the fans.**  &gt; Furkan Korkmaz  Current team: 76ers Played for teams in Turkey  **They will talk shit about your family, and not like here. About your mom, your dad, if you have sisters, they know everything. They will Google stuff about your family, and I was still really young when I played over there, so think how crazy that is.**  &gt; Frank Ntilikina  Current team: Knicks Played for a team in France  My craziest memory was the (2016) EuroCup final against Galatasaray. The away game in Turkey, I remember walking to the locker room before the game and the walls were shaking because the fans were already so crazy inside. We (SIG Strasbourg) couldn't hear our coach talking in the locker room, because of the fans in the arena.  &gt; Joe Ingles  Current team: Jazz Played for teams in Spain and Israel  Serbia and Turkey were always the craziest, but I remember in Greece one year, in Panathinaikos, someone threw a plastic cup of Coke at us during a timeout, and it landed right on our coach's whiteboard while he was drawing up a play. That's pretty funny, but it wasn't funny at the time. He was pretty mad, but what are you going to do? They don't kick people out for that stuff there or try to find out who did it.  One of my teammates, I don't remember if it was a lighter or a thick coin, but one of my teammates one year got his head split open from someone throwing something. But then there's a good kind of crazy, too. Maccabi (in Israel), where I played, no one was throwing anything, but to have 15,000 people love being such a part of the game, it was wild.  &gt; P.J. Tucker  Current team: Rockets Played for teams in Israel, Ukraine, Greece, Italy, and Germany  **There's nothing like Greece and Turkey. Israel's pretty turned up, too. But yeah, over there, it's not like fans. It's like gangs. It's like hoods. It's about where you're from, and they take it very personal. They love - love - their teams. When I was in Greece, I played for Aris, and when we played PAOK, I had to have a security detail, because it's a big, big rivalry in Thessaloniki. It splits the city. When we played, it got so crazy that they shut the fans out and we had to play a game (later) that season with no fans (in the arena).**  I played a game in Turkey where fans were lighting coins - like using a lighter to light the coins - then throwing them at us.  &gt; Goran Dragic  Current team: Heat Played for teams in Slovenia and Spain  I've played a lot of games in Belgrade and other places where if you're not careful, you can get hurt. They throw crazy stuff. I've been a part of one game in Olympiacos (Greece) where they threw oranges on the court. I never found out why. In Belgrade, they just throw coins and lighters. In Europe, most of the arenas, they put a protection, like a tunnel, behind the benches, so players don't get hit. When you're sitting on the road bench in Europe, all you hear is 'tick tick tick' - things hitting the tunnel. It's part of it. You get used to it.  One game I played in Croatia, in Zadar, and they have this organization of fans that are really crazy. We had an incident where one of our players got in a fight with a Zadar player, and these fans broke onto the court, and we just took off, we had to run (away) to the locker room in the middle of the game. I was only 16 at the time.  It's funny you know, over there, when you're on the road, you don't know if the security guys are with them or if they are going to protect you."
Anything involving Frank Ntilikina
Frank Ntilikina
Don‚Äôt forget defensive ace and next coming of Michael Jordan AKA Frank Ntilikina.
We picked Frank Ntilikina when Donovan's dad works for the damn Mets.
Not even the #1 French player. Let‚Äôs not forget Frank ‚Äúthe Frenchise‚Äù Ntilikina
PG13 for Frank Ntilikina that is our final offer
"Tf you talkin about? It's so played out-- just like the Frank Ntilikina vs. Dame Lillard debate, I mean give it a rest already"
They will shine playing with Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox.
"donovan mitchell is a baller, good thing we took frank ntilikina instead of him"
Switch out Ben for Frank Ntilikina
"Yeah to be fair that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs played six total minutes in three losses these playoffs.   He‚Äôs played the 223rd least minutes per game out of 230 players, beating out only Keljin Blevins, Tolliver, Amir Coffey, Rayjon Tucker, Yogi Ferrell, Frank Ntilikina, and Tacko Fall. That can kind of mess with the usage percentage - Rayjon Tucker is 8th for example"
Also Frank Ntilikina.
"Yep. As an unbiased honest Blazers fan, I think we need to trade Dame to a contender, probably the New York Knicks for quality assets. I'm thinking of starting PG vet leader Elfrid Payton, young prospects Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox, and maybe a second round pick."
"Frank Ntilikina, Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw, Evan Fournier, Mickael Pietrus, Rodrigue Beaubois, Nando De Colo, etc"
Joakim Noah.  Frank Ntilikina.
Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox perhaps
Confidence is one of the best skills^(just ask frank ntilikina)
Eh Let‚Äôs pump the breaks a bit. Phil drafted Frank Ntilikina over Donovan Mitchell because Franky Smokes fit the triangle better.

Frank Ntilikina üòç
Can I at least some Frank Ntilikina action before the last fleeting seconds of garbage time thibs?
Any plan for that Jaylen Brown foe? Do you think he is a qualified piece for Frank Ntilikina?
Kyrie Irving 100% having nightmares about Frank Ntilikina
Better hope yall dont face Frank Ntilikina and the Knicks then.
"Bullock literally sits in the corner and lets Trae rest on defense it's so frusturating. Burks would at least attack him if he was on the floor. I think DRose shouldn't be starting, he's our best player but we need him to lead the bench unit. Quickley specifically struggles without him on the floor at the same time  Dare I say it... Frank Ntilikina should be starting, he'd be doing the same thing Bullock is except playing actual defense (and Frank actually shoots corner 3s at a really high clip)."
"D‚ÄôLo barely had any trade value. The Wiggins trade looks great in hindsight, but a year ago, it was widely speculated that the Timberwolves would‚Äôve needed to attach a first just to get rid of him. And the Knicks offered Frank Ntilikina and a first for D‚ÄôLo. The league clearly wasn‚Äôt very high on him"
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
"We're talking about Frank ntilikina, not Payton"
"&gt;ntilikina played so bad  frank played a total of 32 seconds the whole game. 9 seconds of which is in that [trae game winner](https://youtu.be/ujy7hN-THb8). before that, the last time he was on the floor was during the last 23 seconds of the 2nd quarter.  the way i understood it, chuck is less focused about how frank played moreso how he thinks thibs made a mistake putting a cold player out there to guard someone like trae.   regardless if people would put the blame on thibs, frank, the lack of defensive help from the others, or all of the above ‚Äî- regarding u/snoo_srba ‚Äòs question:   [‚Äútoast‚Äù](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/toast) is chuck‚Äôs family friendly way of saying ‚Äúfucked‚Äù, as in frank‚Äôs basically fucked in that possesion."
Thybulle is who Knicks fans think Frank Ntilikina is
Best=Julius Randle. Young exciting=RJ Barrett. Vet Beast= Derrick Rose. MVP=Frank Ntilikina.
I think Frank Ntilikina may help them more than Derrick Rose does... Frank may become playable given Clippers' roster.
1. Subbing frank ntilikina in for ‚Äúdefense‚Äù  2. Toppin scoring 3 buckets in a row then getting benched for a cold Randle  3. whenever the knicks chuck up bricks wth 20 seconds left on the clock
Looks like Taj Gibson ran a screen on Frank Ntilikina allowing Trae Young path to basket ... WTF?
"Even without the commentary is easy to spot that Ntilikina fucked up, Taj is doubling Trae from the left side and Frank had to stop him from going right, because that's effectively the only way he can get to the paint for a layup or hit the floater. If Ntilikina doesn't bite and never allows Trae to go to his dominant hand, Trae would've had to either pull up from 30 feet for a contested jumper or passed out of the double team.  Taj Gibson played it perfectly and the defensive scheme was really good aswell, but an individual mistake cost them and Trae got an easy game winner."
"Except the dude they out on him the last possession Frank Ntilikina, defensive specialist?"
Frank Ntilikina confirmed a Knicks fan
They‚Äôve got Frank ‚ÄúLockdown Defender‚Äù Ntilikina to thank.

Frank ntilikina could be a fashion model  Frank kaminsky could model at land of the free and home of the whopper
Frank Ntilikina - Lance Thomas - Carmelo Anthony - Wilson Chandler - Stephon Marbury - Allan Houston - Patrick Ewing - Bill Cartwright - Earl Monroe - Willis Reed - Johnny Green - Carl Braun - Leo Gottlieb  Knicks goes all the way back to the very first game in NBA history
"Funny enough, Frank Ntilikina is out of the rotation as well."
Enes Kanter will always have my respect for not letting LeBroke Ankles getting away with trying to bully Frank Ntilikina.
Yes. And the others were (almost) exclusivly when we didn't play more than 9 guys.  We don't have the depth of other teams. Frank Ntilikina was our first reserve
Frank Ntilikina had a 20 10 game at the end of last season =)
Frank Ntilikina. Shoots 19 percent from 2 pointers
Frank Ntilikina
Frank Ntilikina
Fred is a better defender anyway. It‚Äôs like saying Frank Ntilikina is better than Chris Paul.
"Lol Knicks fans are so dumb. Yeah, the same Knicks fans who had a ""we didnt trade Frank Ntilikina for Kyrie Irving Upvote Party"" on our sub. The same Knick fans who thought we shouldnt trade for Chris Paul. The same Knicks fans who thought we should trade Randle for a 1st round pick  Knick fans are more in love with some romantic idea of a team than a team that wins. If we had traded for Paul this year we very well could be in the Finals. The East is wide open. The teams are flawed."
Can‚Äôt wait for Frank Ntilikina and Nic Batum to wreck this team
"IQ is absolutely on the table lmao. Some of y‚Äôall think we can get Dame fucking Lillard with Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox, plus a couple of late firsts. Absolutely deluded."
Some guy on Twitter said Frank Ntilikina should be paid a huge contract since Duncan Robinson may get 18 million. And that Frank is the best player on the french team while Duncan wouldnt be the best player in his pickup game
Frank Ntilikina is also on the Knicks
"With no disrespect to you personally. I think the same if Ntilikina.   Obviously I don‚Äôt watch as many Knock games as you, but I‚Äôve watched Frank probably 15 times or thereabouts. And he‚Äôs shown nothing beside some ever so slightly above average defense. No jumper, a satisfactory handle n that‚Äôs it.   He and Knox just don‚Äôt strike me as basketballers and yet they‚Äôre both top 10 picks"
"There are a lot of reasons to criticize the Knicks for picking Frank Ntilikina in 2017.  But for whatever reason, the biggest reason Stephen A. also harps on is ""you draft this guy FROM FRANCE?!"".  Also, Porzingis had to put together like 3 solid months before Stephen A. even made an attempt to pronounce his name correctly and without laughing while doing it.  The man is outwardly xenophobic when it comes to European players in general."
"I mean, if we retain Frank Ntilikina and trade for Dennis Smith Jr., the two of them with Elfrid Payton could combine to put up 85 points to squeeze out one more win."
we call that the Frank Ntilikina Special
Wait a minute. Michael Pietrus is Air France??? I‚Äôve been calling Frank Ntilikina that this whole time! I even @‚Äòd him on Twitter with that.   OMG I feel so stupid!
Frank Ntilikina already exists
Literally happened this year with Frank Ntilikina in the playoffs
Frank Ntilikina to the Warriors.
I understand losing a team like Spain or Serbia...but they lost to fucking France and Pop got the shit coached out of him. Gobert is good but not that good and Frank Ntilikina was clutch af.
Uh I don‚Äôt see Anthony Joshua and Frank Ntilikina in that vid
We only lost against Germany because Frank Ntilikina wasn't born yet.
"Oh God please let it be **Frank Ntilikina**.  ^^^I ^^^know, ^^^I ^^^know."
&amp; Frank Ntilikina
Like how Frank ntilikina killed us in the fiba cup
"Are you serious? Him and Ntilikina have drawn the bust bro curtains for a while now. Knicks had 3 draft busts on the same team at one point, DSJ, Frank, Knox  LOL."
I stopped reading at Frank Ntilikina. That‚Äôs a croissant dynasty right there.
He played Frank Ntilikina at the 4.
"The part I think you're really struggling with is you said Timmy has no offense without Luka, as I said that's stupid. Worse offense does not equal no offense and that's the part you're not wrapping your head around. A player with no offense is someone like Frank Ntilikina or DSJ, now those guys have no offense, Timmy without Luka does not equal no offense. Turning a 35% shooter into a 40% shooter also isn't a guarantee as well, that's another thing you're not able to grasp.  Josh richardson shot 35% from 3 before he played in Dallas, what happened to him? Uh oh, he didn't shoot 40%"
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Mo Bamba and I‚Äôm willing to give Frank Ntilikina a shot too
Mitchell is apparently pretty good friends with Frank Ntilikina after they bonded during their draft workouts.
Batum / Fournier / Gobert / Ntilikina  The U.S had way more talent. France was often depending on Frank to be their primary shot creator.
"Kemba got outplayed by Frank Ntilikina, fam.  That FIBA appearance was pretty brutal."
"I am worried about the Knicks ruining their new team culture by trading guys away to try to get a star, especially one that doesn't fit perfectly, but a big sore spot for the Knicks was having only 2 guys trusted to guard small forwards (RJ and Reggie Bullock), and they were 2 of the only guys who would be trusted in the clutch to guard shooting guards. I don't want RJ to play 46+ minutes in back to back games ever again unless its conference finals or finals and overtime both times. I would be ok with the Knicks trading for Ben Simmons if they don't have to give up Randle, RJ, Reggie Bullock, or Immanuel Quickley. I think losing Derrick Rose would be unavoidable, he seems like the only one outside of those players the Sixers would actually want. If we get Alec Burks back, RJ keeps improving his 3pt shot, and Randle keeps shooting like a god, it might not be terrible spacing, at least not worse than with Frank Ntilikina (yes I know he shot like 40% from 3 this year but a lot of them were uncontested corner 3s in garbage time) or Elfrid Payton (as long as we forget the first 5 games of the season where he looked like discount MVP Westbrook)."
"I just want any team with a decent player development program to pick up Frank Ntilikina. He's got all the measurables, just ZERO confidence."
someone should try this with frank ntilikina
It's probably not the same today as it was a year or two ago but no touches nerves like Frank Ntilikina.
frank ntilikina - he‚Äôs still learning how to dribble with his head up
"Cap. If Frank Ntilikina wants to talk shit to you, you say yes sir, shut up and take it"
Y‚Äôall must‚Äôve forgot when frank ntilikina sent team USA packing
Our sub has a guy whos obsessed with frank Ntilikina of all people. Every post is related to him. The post could be about Julius Randle and he‚Äôll be trying to give an essay on why frank sucks as if he‚Äôs our starting pg and not someone on the end of our bench üòÇ
Alright boys new debate frank ntilikina or Michael Jordan
"&gt;That wasn‚Äôt the point at all you dumb bitch you just can‚Äôt read  Ah yes. When you run out of arguments, resort to name-calling. A tried and tested strategy. Just pitiful.  &gt;Our team almost definitely has more cap space and more picks with a better record than you I can guarantee it  Oh damn. I forgot about the amazing FA acquisitions and drafting the Knicks have done recently. My bad. After all, only a competent organization can recognize a gem like Frank Ntilikina and pick him."
Frank Ntilikina
Thought Frank Ntilikina would eventually work his way into like a Pat Bev role. Thought Kevin Knox would be an elite bench scorer. But that's homerism I guess.
Nicolas Batum father is from Cameroon. Axel Toupane father is from Senegal. Frank Ntilikina family is from Rwanda.
"Nah man France in fo', who on this team can guard Frank Ntilikina ?"
Until Frank Ntilikina ends their run
It's a love / hate thing but there is a deep and pure love from a large section of the Knicks fan base for the French bench warmer Frank Ntilikina...
"Nah I completely disagree. Hayes can shoot. He shot 40% from 3 last season and has steadily improved his shot this season, going from like 20% in his first month to 33% in his last month. It ain‚Äôt great but his form is pretty and I have no doubt in my mind he‚Äôll be a great player. Very few players can pass like he can, and he‚Äôs only 19. This isn‚Äôt like Frank Ntilikina, Killian legit has so much potential. Just cause Cade is the main ball handler doesn‚Äôt mean Killian will bust - in fact, Killian‚Äôs had his best games this season at the 2. Its wayyyy too early to sell on him, ion want no 15th pick for this stud."
There‚Äôs a whole subreddit dedicated to Frank Ntilikina if that isn‚Äôt the strangest attachment yet for the longest tenured Knick
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas ‚Äì New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama ‚Äì Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France ‚Äì New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington ‚Äì Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest ‚Äì L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
Frank Ntilikina locked Kemba tf up
Ben simmons should try to pass the ball into the hoop.    Ben simmons should try the rick Barry shot    Ben simmons should be traded to the knicks for frank ntilikina since he's like a Ben that shoots
Frank ntilikina the savior of NYC. Jk a certified bust
Huh sorry but you know France is in the same bracket right ? Team USA has no answer to the Frank Ntilikina/Evan Fournier backcourt.
"He didn't want to get clowned on by Frank Ntilikina in a 70-127 lose against France, I can understand that."
FRANK NTILIKINA &gt; BEN SIMMONS
"That's fair enough, but france team had Rudy Gobert, Evan Forunier, Nicolas Batum, and Frank Ntilikina, no all stars level player (you can argue for Rudy Gobert).   USA teams can overcome chemistry issues because of the overwhelming talent, but that wasn't the case that time. You have to admit that the world is slowly catching up in talent."
BRB.  Going to shave Frank Ntilikina bald.
Ben Simmons is a taller Frank Ntilikina.
I have never seen a player more devoid of confidence and i watched Elfrid Payton and Frank ntilikina play all year
Dennis Smith Jr   Ron Baker  Frank Ntilikina
"All your guard are getting COOKED by Frank Ntilikina, mark my words. He conserved his energy all season just for that.   France in foooooo'."
Tim Thomas.  Jonathan Bender.  (sigh) Frank Ntilikina
I hope the Knicks do something similar and bring Frank Ntilikina coming back as a special advisor next season
I can't watch this anymore without thinking of the edit with Frank Ntilikina
"Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Mavs 2023 first round pick"
Always have to make the Montreal Francs and trade for Frank Ntilikina
"Off the top of my head, Dante Exum, Markelle Fultz, Justise Winslow, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina"
Frank Ntilikina
"Markelle Fultz is not a bust. Dude is an above average player in the league right now. The only reason people don‚Äôt know that is because he plays in Orlando, and most people stopped paying attention to him after he got traded.  Josh Jackson(sort of) and DSJ are the two busts from that draft. You could argue Frank Ntilikina too, just because he‚Äôs still unplayable in some matchups due to spacing problems."
I still believe in Frank Ntilikina.
Frank Ntilikina because Curry got his name right.
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
Discount Frank Ntilikina honestly

"You should've seen the heat I used to take for saying things that were incredibly obvious to fans of 29 other teams such as ""Frank Ntilikina is bad.""  You get vindicated eventually, but it's annoying."
What about Frank Ntilikina
Frank Ntilikina
He was unnecessarily mean to ~~the Knicks ball boy~~ Frank Ntilikina too
Of course defense matters. But it‚Äôs not the only thing that matters. If it was then Frank Ntilikina would be playable. Simmons is a liability in the halfcourt and his confidence is shot. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not a top 40 player.

"Frank Ntilikina.   If you‚Äôd just let the ball move without ego, god damn that dude can play a pure game of basketball."
Frank Ntilikina
May as well add De'Anthony Melton and Frank Ntilikina if u putting Herro on here
All this time i thought Frank Nitty is a nickname for Ntilikina
"Frank Ntilikina would excel on the Spurs or jazz  Devin Booker is overrated   Chris Paul plays a lot dirtier than given credit for  Doris Burke is annoying as hell/ we don‚Äôt need to hear about the nets team and or players every game especially when they aren‚Äôt playing  Mike breen needs to save Bang! For special occasions only   Woj became annoying the second he knew he was popular just like Adam schefter  Kyrie won‚Äôt win anything without lebron  Luka won‚Äôt win a title with Dallas   Hardaway Jr is extremely overrated. Either he‚Äôs on fire or a clunker there is no in between.  Rachel Nichols isn‚Äôt all that and a bag of chimps   Mark and Gundy use the word absolutely waaaay too much  Bullock well he shoots at a good percentage people miss the fact that it usually is to start the games and then he disappears for the last 35 minutes.  Steve nash was a scapegoat hire not a white hire. If they fail they‚Äôll just wipe their hands clean and move on.  New Orleans needs to relocate or they‚Äôre gonna lose Zion because they can‚Äôt get anyone who wants to there (even though New Orleans is a pretty chill place)  Minnesota should just move to Seattle already I‚Äôm hoping that is A rods plan. Minnesota is like Idaho and the Dakotas sure they‚Äôre states but ehhh that‚Äôs about it. Nobody really mentions them.   Jimmy butler is not a superstar and the heat are not a superteam. They‚Äôre a great team but not a superteam (with Lowry included of course)  The bulls are so overhyped on just signing lonzo, a guy who can‚Äôt create his own shot had one just one decent year so far. They‚Äôre going to be 7th or 8th seed tops."
Frank Ntilikina
"per multiple sources, the pelicans have interested in Frank Ntilikina."
"I'm pretty sure that it does not count unless they say it three times.  ""We renounce the free-agent rights to Frank Ntilikina""  ""We renounce the free-agent rights to Frank Ntilikina""  ""We renounce the free-agent rights to Frank Ntilikina"""
"Frank was inexplicably asked to play the wrong position for 3 seasons. His defense is incredible, Thybulle like, but I have never seen a ""point guard"" with worse ability to finish around the basket than Ntilikina. Speaking of Thybulle, Frank is actually younger than him so hopefully another team picks him up and lets him focus on being a 3&amp;D player."
"Frank Ntilikina, Sekou Doumbouya, and soon Killian Hayes. So many questionable picks from France"
"Jimmer Fredette, Frank Ntilikina, Kris Dunn?"
"Klay aint coming back until mid-way through the season, no reason he can't start next to Steph until then.  Whats the alternative? Saving it for Frank Ntilikina?"
"It's not just Hayes, he is way too high on too many guys who bust, he loved Frank Ntilikina and Mo Bamba too. It's a bad track record. Tjarks to me has consistently been better.   I also listened to his free agency podcast and he said that he liked the DeRozan, Jarrett Allen, and fucking Zack Collins contracts. I don't think I can disagree more with someone's view of what were good contracts in this off-season.   His analysis is just not that in depth. It's simplistic and lacks nuance. He repeats the same advice for literally every guard star in the NBA, in that he always says the next step for Dame, Harden, Trae, LaVine, Booker, and Beal is to play off the ball and cut like Steph Curry, neglecting the fact that Dame and Harden are too old to change their games like that and that NBA superstars love having the ball in their hands, not running around off the ball hoping to get the ball back from an inferior teammate. You're not going to turn Dame into an off the ball player at this stage in his career, it's just not going to happen. (How's he going to do that on the Blazers anyway?)"
frank ntilikina is alive
"Lmfao at the Frank Ntilikina take, as the Knicks put in Frank to guard him at the end of game 1 of the playoffs and Trae toasted him for the GW floater"
Frank Ntilikina still has a cult following. Never say never fam.
Lmao you think he passes to Frank ntilikina with a gold medal in the line hahahahaha
I was about to say if Frank Ntilikina hits two of the biggest 3s down the stretch...
Imagine if Frank fucking Ntilikina hits a game winner to win the gold medal over team USA
LMFAO Who the fuck does Frank Ntilikina think he is üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Who the fuck does Frank Ntilikina think he is lmao
frank ntilikina playing for his contract rn
Frank Ntilikina owns USA
YOU CAN'T STOP FRANK NTILIKINA. ^You ^can ^only ^hope ^to ^contain ^him.
I‚Äôd rather have Frank Ntilikina than DSJ
Frank Ntilikina was vastly overrated by my fellow knick fans for years. I think even the Frank stans are starting to realize he isn‚Äôt good.
Dude shot 5/18 and was clamped by Frank Ntilikina but he thinks the game was rigged LMFAOOOOO
Wow just the presence of Frank Ntilikina on that play!!! Oh my!!
"He started really well with quick 12pts 8ast, then his frustrations started when Frank Ntilikina guarded him in the 2nd quarter, not allowing him to contribute anything, slashing their early lead by end of the 1st half. The frustration carried on with Batum and Cabarot on him, even earning him a tech. All around great game still, his passing was incredible all game."
Frank Ntilikina does have quite quick hands
Frank Ntilikina is gonna throw it down in Bam Adebayo Face in the Gold Medal Game

"right before the whistle blows for game 1, kemba and d rose rip off their masks and it‚Äôs elfrid payton and frank ntilikina."
"Knicks were a top 2-3 defensive team last season and the 4 seed. We took the same roster and traded Elfrid Payton, Frank Ntilikina, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker. I'm not sure where your logic is?"
"At least we have Paris St. Germain, right?  Shams: PSG sign Frank Ntilikina to 3y, ‚Ç¨ 30M contract"
Wait until you see what Frank (Ntilikina) does
They need to go out and sign some defenders. They should sign Frank Ntilikina
Frank Ntilikina? Can't he be recast as a wing like MCW was?
It is actually hilarious how quickly this sub went from saying he was one of the most important players on the floor for the Bucks and they don‚Äôt win a title without him to ‚Äúactually he‚Äôs basically washed and can be easily replaced with someone like Frank Ntilikina‚Äù   Like you said I saw people eating hundreds of downvotes for even attempting to say he was not playing anywhere near as good as this sub thought.
"You can probably find a defensive minded 2nd rounder or UDFA that can grow into that role, who won‚Äôt put you into the tax.  Hell Frank Ntilikina is an inch shorter and would cost a fraction of the price."

the disrespect to frank ntilikina
Frank Ntilikina has found his home I see.
In no order:  1. bagley 2. Poku 3. Frank Ntilikina 4. Dorian finney-smith 5. LiAngelo Ball
Yeah they should S&amp;T for Frank Ntilikina. He could let Porzingis shine more.
Didn't Frank Ntilikina embarrass Luka enough on television already?
It‚Äôs been real sad going from the earlier Reddit days of seeing people argue about Carmelo Anthony to arguing about Frank Ntilikina smh. I liked Frank though. Pour one out
"I won't be surprised at all if 26 year old Frank Ntilikina is viewed as a top-tier backup on a good team, but he has a new injury every month and they derail him every time it looks like his game is coming together. Combine that with his sizeable cap hold and time just had to be up. Hopefully he gets his body right, gets a few healthy seasons under his belt, and gets an opportunity to make good on a little of his potential."
"Alright, I present you Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilikina. Two other scrubs that are young that haven't had consistent playing time.  Every team has these, Cam just has the flash to keep confusing you. You think he's good because he does. He's not."
"1 if you count Axel Hervelle, drafted by the Nuggets but never played a game.  Also, Knicks GOAT Frank Ntilikina was born in Belgium!"
"Oh touche, I thought RHJ went way higher than that...still I could find other examples too if you wanted. Jonathan Issac, Frank Ntilikina, Mo Bamba and Deandre Hunter are a couple other ones..Hunter looks to be working out though."
Tell me about it dude I'm the OG Frank Ntilikina stan. I interrupted his date with a supermodel in Cannes at 2 am just to gas him up for 10 minutes.
Frank Ntilikina
"Knicks  Frank Ntilikina for Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Thybulle"
"Teams are so delusional about their young players, like the knicks and frank ntilikina"
It makes me sad but Frank Ntilikina (6'7 I think)
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"I knew Frank Ntilikina was a bust before he was even drafted. A combo guard in a horrid French league averaging 5 pts with no handles, leads to none other than the epitome of a bust."
"His 5.3 PER and .422 TS% say otherwise, Cap.  Here's a nice video of Frank Ntilikina looking good at basketball though!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZUKRaI\_xy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZUKRaI_xy0)"
TBF those 26 games he played did not look very promising. Congrats on getting the next Frank Ntilikina though!
Obi Tobbin? Frank Ntilikina? If anything I think Mitchell Robinson is inflating your average...those second round picks who ended up having any value really seem to boost the rating
"They have more than 3 NBA players on their team. There‚Äôs Gobert, Batum, Fournier, Nando (who did play in the NBA), Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and Frank Ntilikina"
"Yeah, he only has Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard and a bunch of other All-stars. They're getting outplayed by Rudy Gobert, Evan Fournier and Frank Ntilikina."
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hell of a team‚Äù    Frank Ntilikina, Timoth√© Luwawu-Cabarrot, Thomas Heurtel, Nicolas Batum, Guerschon Yabusele, Evan Fournier, Nando de Colo, Fenerbah√ße	, Vincent Poirier, Andrew Albicy, Gran Canaria, Rudy Gobert, Petr Cornelie, Pau-Lacq-Orthez, Moustapha Fall  Edit - grammer"
"France didn't even use their secret weapon, Defensive Stopper Frank Ntilikina"
wym 'Best shooters in the world' ? Frank Ntilikina wasn't playing.
They thought Frank Ntilikina would be playing an thus tried to avoid burgerland getting humiliated on national TV.
Has Frank Ntilikina been getting minutes? Been on the bench since i turned it on
There's no adjusting to Frank Ntilikina. Even though he hasn't played yet.
Has Frank Ntilikina played yet?
Frank Ntilikina to turn into prime Jordan like the last time they played the US?
Frank Ntilikina
"Theo pinson, Frank Ntilikina, Bobby Portis still"
Frank Ntilikina hasn‚Äôt even turned 23 yet but some Knick fans will swear he‚Äôs a bust
Theo Pinson was obviously the key to the Knicks finishing fourth this season. Frank Ntilikina is better than Jrue Holiday. RJ is basically MJ. Obi Toppin and Kevin Knox are both better than Kevin Durant. Mitchell Robinson is basically Wilt.

"Our boi, Frank ""The FO Killer"" Ntilikina, already making his mark."
"I think you're maybe taking Rotation Player the wrong way. Rotation Players are like solid guys that you want on your roster. And I'm just guessing that anything Prospect is probably constrained by years in the league. They probably aren't categorizing anyone going into their 4th year as a Prospect.  Don't want to put words in your mouth. I think rotational player is probably right for him. His ceiling is definitely higher than that, but I'm guessing this is looking at his most likely scenario.   Norm Powell is also a Rotational Player. Gordon Hayward is a Rotation Player. Aaron Gordon. But so are guys like Frank Ntilikina and Derrick Jones Jr. It's a big range."
My strongest memory of Frank Ntilikina is Clique making him into a meme.
I will never forget the wildly upvoted highlight videos or posts that would be like ‚ÄúFRANK NTILIKINA - 15 minutes 3/1/1 INSANE REBOUND‚Äù lmfao
This is true. I remember talking to a cabbie in NYC and he immediately brought up how excited he was about Frank Ntilikina. It wasn‚Äôt just a Reddit phenomenon.
My Knicks fan friend once called Frank Ntilikina the ‚Äúbest two-way guard in the league‚Äù. We still haven‚Äôt let him live that one down.
Frank Ntilikina on the Mavs eh? if Frank and KP share any mins on the floor that would be crazy lol
"How so? We just acquired our superstar, future DPOY Frank ""Le Stops"" Ntilikina."
It reminds me of the one Frank Ntilikina wrote before his first season with the Knicks.
Hilarious that Dennis smith Jr and Frank ntilikina have both played for the Mavericks and Knicks after being back to back picks
Every time Frank Ntilikina is mentioned i will always get reminded to rewatch and laugh at [Steph](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FgfDgSZoREo) trying to say his last name
More like Luka took a #2 and named it Frank Ntilikina.
" If Frank has million number of fans i am one of them  If Frank has only 20 fans I am one of them  If Frank has only one fan then i am the one  If Frank has no fans that means I am no more  I will never go against Frank Ntilikina, A biggest Frank stan forever!  GOAT forever!!! üá´üá∑ üëë"
2022 Nba champion frank ntilikina?
Frank Ntilikina doesn't belong in the rotation **at all**.
I know people like to shit on frank but he‚Äôs actually a nice fit next to Luka I don‚Äôt know why you are being down voted..?  He‚Äôs alright at playmaking and is good at defense   Who‚Äôs the best guard frank has played with? Tim Hardaway? Trey Burke? Courtney Lee? Derrick Rose last year? Luka is going to be all of the offense of this team and a player like frank fits the mavs future better...  the mavs need to punch up the rest of the roster  A 23 year old Ntilikina fits much better skill set and timeline wise with 22 year old Luka than 35 year old Goran Dragic....
"I read this as former Knicks ""great"" Frank Ntilikina"

Frank Ntilikina / Dennis Smith Jr / Kevin Knox / Sekou Doumbouya / Harry Giles
"Frank does not lack bbiq at all, his problem is confidence.  He was also really good at making pocket passes off pick n rolls in his first 2 years in the league. Since Thibs came over, Franks role was very limited to change his position to a catch and shoot wing defender that had to ""get to the 3pt line, pass it off to someone else at the 3pt line"". Thibs has no time to develop young guys like Ntilikina and Knox unless they produce right away like Quickley."
"Frank Ntilikina. Long wingspan, drafted to be a guard, has decent shooting form... but he is supposed to be a point guard and his playmaking just fucking sucks. I dont know if its confidence or bbiq, but if he could just attempt a drive here and there it would have done wonders for his career. I mean, if he could do any sort of passing that wasn't ""get to the 3pt line, pass it off to someone else at the 3pt line"" he could have been great maybe."
Hi Frank Ntilikina
Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilikina
Making room for Frank Ntilikina üëÄ
The Frank Ntilikina special. Guys who are straight garbage but their fans keep raving about their ‚Äúall nba level‚Äù defense that‚Äôs overrated anyways.
"Killian Hayes, Frank Ntilikina, Theo Maledon are all heirs to the throne of Tony Parker  Cest nul"
"From the Knicks side - he couldn‚Äôt beat out Emmanuel Mudiay and Frank Ntilikina for the starting spot, both years after that, he couldn‚Äôt beat out Frank or Elf for the starting spot.  His first real season with us he got injured ‚Äî came back and played bad. That same year, he lost a close family member and took some time off ‚Äî came back and played worse (also got boo‚Äôed by the fans)  On the court he didn‚Äôt show flashes of anything special. Couldn‚Äôt beat dudes off the dribble, couldn‚Äôt run a offense, defensively REALLY bad (although Thibs somehow turned him into prime Gary Payton in the pre-season).   IMO he‚Äôs at most.. a spot rotational player/ end of bench guy."
"Frank Ntilikina, I think he can turn it around. Though not getting minutes with Thibs the PG whisperer isn't a good sign. He probably needed to get out of NY."
Frank Ntilikina with a consistent role i think he can be a solid pg in the league
i'm still on that Frank Ntilikina/Kevin Knox hopium
Frank Bryan Ntilikina.
"Became a Knicks fan around 2011, but been diehard since 2013.   Where do I begin?   Alexey Shved or Langston Galloway being legitimately the best player on the floor at times in 2014/15?  Losing our pick in 2016 to the nuggets, who drafted Jamal Murray?  Jarrett Jack and Ramon Sessions getting reps at PG in 2018?  Getting backstabbed by KP in 2019, followed by falling to the third overall pick in the 2019 draft?  Drafting Kevin Knox instead of MPJ, and Frank Ntilikina ahead of Donovan Mitchell?  It's been a dark eight years. Let us have this moment with a competent FO and team."

In 2019 when the Knicks played the Mavericks in Dallas and Frank Ntilikina drove to the rim [to dunk try and dunk on Kristaps Porzingis](https://youtu.be/kNLU6nFDjDo). Was sitting on the couch and leaped up yelling after someone who‚Äôs incapable of scoring confidently shoved his nuts in the face of someone who was the franchises biggest villain at the time
Frank Ntilikina will become a NBA level player
Frank Ntilikina would suck
Frank Ntilikina is literally the greatest defensive player ever how is this an insult
Frank Ntilikina can be a starter
"Wait, didn't we release Frank Ntilikina?"
"i thought frank ntilikina would be taller, better passing pat bev and josh jackson a better shooting iguodala"
"Gotta be Frank Ntilikina, Josh Green, and Sterling Brown"
The man singlehandedly behind Frank Ntilikina debates.
(provided you can do something offensively - see the Frank Ntilikina experiment)
Frank Ntilikina got it this year
"Omg get over it already. And this comes from someone who owns a Ntilikina jersey. At best he is a rotation player, every other player in this thread is mainly a generational talent.  Hit me up 10 years from now when Frank is a multi euro league champion."
Frank Ntilikina
"I know in general nobody should be panicking after one game, but I think in this case the mavs should be panicking  yeah the hawks are good, but they looked totally outclassed as a team  they have the same roster as last year basically.  their big acquisitions were spot-shooter reggie bullock and frank ntilikina who is not a NBA caliber player.   they already have THJ to fill the spot shooter role so why go for bullock  dwight powell is not a NBA starting caliber player anymore and yet they don't have anyone else to start over him.   he gives them almost nothing on either end of the floor.  dorian finney smith is a total crapshoot from night to night what you will get.     KP is actually one of their least concerns because while he's a fundamentally flawed player at least he and luka have really nice PNR chemistry which will probably be their main scoring engine this season  they are not moving in the right direction and they probably don't have any chance to win the championship with this roster.  they don't have enough assets to get a game-changing wing player that they need to replace powell  they have the same issues as last year except with worse coaching, what are their options to improve as a team?   at least the cowboys are good I guess"
"If only we had other good young players who made all rookie teams and the #1 pick, oh well.   How's Frank Ntilikina doing?"
"Idk. You guys needed a rim protector and secondary ball handler and you went out and signed Reggie bullock. Great player but idk how you're going to exceed last year because 3,&amp;D didn't seem like what you needed and yet thats what you got.    Shoutour frank ntilikina. Watch him do this again 81 times"
wont stand for this frank ntilikina slander
"When Ntilikina missed that shot, the Hawks‚Äô radio play-by-play guys said, ‚ÄúFrank Ntilikina picking up right where he left off with the Knicks.‚Äù Lol."
"mavs took THJ, KP, reggie bullock, trey burke and frank ntilikina from us  its only fair they send us luka, 1 for 5 thats more than fair"
instead of getting luka's slovenian teammates he was tearing it up with in the olympics they decided to get frank ntilikina and reggie bullock
frank ntilikina would never let his team go into halftime with a 7 point deficit
we demand another team give minutes to frank ntilikina
we demand frank ntilikina
Reminding me of Knicks Legend Frank Ntilikina. Hope RJ has a better future.
Frank Ntilikina with a ROY vote lmao
Crazy that Frank Ntilikina is the second best player on the Mavs
Idk what you‚Äôre saying. Frank ntilikina is a god
"Mavs. Luka will be outstanding as usual but getting Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina as their big off season moves? I appreciate them for their service, but those aren't what I'd consider the kinda moves that'll get them far in the West."
"Take that and add those minor moves that DO have a huge impact to our roster.  We are a seriously deeper team now with a lot more defense.  We basically replaced Nico Melli, Wes Iwundu, and the corpse of Jason Richardson, for Reggie Bullock - a solid 3 &amp; D starter for a playoff team, Sterling Brown who plays above average D and hit 42% from deep last year, and a flyer on Frank Ntilikina who hopefully can be a matchup based defender on some more elite wings when needed.  Even if KP doesn't improve, our regular season record should be much better simply because we are deeper.  KP is going to be the ceiling raiser in the playoffs."
"Nah it‚Äôs that we sucked AND we whiffed on multiple top ten draft picks (see Jordan Hill, Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina)"
"&gt; I mean I would rather Frank Ntilikina than Trey Burke.   What a scathing indictment of Trey Burke. For the record, here's Trey Burke's 2020-2021 matched up against Frank's best cherry-picked stats from any of his seasons:  Burke - .428/.354/.895, per 36 minutes: 16.2 points, 3.1 assists, 2.1 rebounds; .544 TS%, 12.6 PER, 0.0 VORP, .071 WS/48  Frank - .393/.479/.864, per 36 minutes: 10.8 points, 5.3 assists, 3.7 rebounds; .512 TS%, 9.8 PER, 0.0 VORP, .070 WS/48  Remember, I cherry-picked Frank's stats (fg% from 2019-20, 3PT% from 2020-21, for example; should be noted that the .479 is a small sample size of 23 three-pointers all season) and Burke still comes out slightly ahead, imo. Does Frank have more potential? Maybe. But if push came to shove, I think I'd still go with Burke."
I mean I would rather Frank Ntilikina than Trey Burke. But in no way am I expecting Frank to play many meaningful minutes for us. But it's not like he's really costing us anything.
Best: I called Frank Ntilikina being a huge bust before he was drafted. Something about a pg with the dribble moves of a 70‚Äôs power forward that averaged 5 ppg in a crappy French league didn‚Äôt do it for me.
"Let's go. Ive been waiting for this all my life. Frank Ntilikina, your time has come."
Keljin Blevins (Messi) and Frank Ntilikina
Knicks fans act like they win a championship whenever Frank Ntilikina would draw a charge
"Nothing's worse than going into the Knicks sub in the past 4 years and saying anything negative about Frank Ntilikina. Although, I'll be the first one to admit that I was a part of that."
Frank Ntilikina
Dude Luka dragged you to the 5 seed.  TH jr was your second one best player.  Outside of Luka the Dallas roster is not that good.  KP wasn‚Äôt traded because no one wanted him.  TH jr is probably best suited as a 3-D player not the 2nd best player on a team.    I will also leave it at this if Dallas could trade either TH jr or KP for BI straight up they would do it in a heartbeat and be considered a top 4 team in the west.  Dallas might have played as a team under Carlisle and gotten to the 5 seed but that does not meant they have a talented team.    As far as upgrades go seriously Reggie Bullock and Frank Ntilikina?  Seriously they were not good enough for the Knicks so they upgraded from them.  Dallas kept everything the same
"I think it's close but since Luka will be benefiting playing next to Frank Ntilikina, Luka will probably end up looking better."
2016: Kris Dunn to Buddy Hield  2017: Lauri Maurkennen to Frank Ntilikina   2018: None  2019: Jarrett Culver to Coby White  2020: Anthony Edwards to James Wiseman
"Bazemore:  I don't want to be vaccinated.  Pelinka:  Listen here, you little shit.  This is the best chance you have at a championship right now.  If you don't do this, I'll release you right now, and just go grab Frank Ntilikina.  That bench spot is going to be warm one way or another.  Bazemore:  yes, dad."
"Frank Ntilikina, Devontae Graham, &amp; Shaun Livingston."
2016: Denzel Valentine to Juancho Hernangomez  2017: Lauri Markkanen to Frank Ntilikina  2018: Wendell Carter Jr to Collin Sexton  2019: Coby White to Jaxson Hayes  2020: Patrick Williams to Isaac Okoro.
A huge number of Knick fans spent the past 4 years overhyping and making excuses for a player only averaging 6/3/2 on 37% shooting named Frank Ntilikina. It‚Äôs the most annoying shit I‚Äôve ever experienced from the Knicks fan base.
note that this the exact same thing Knicks fans said about Frank Ntilikina
Knicks fan here. I was all in on Malik monk over frank ntilikina. nailed it!
"Part of the reason is the difference is bigger this season is because the Mavs have added better defensive pieces to their bench in Frank Ntilikina, Sterling Brown and Reggie Bullock. (Not big names, but great defenders statistically over their careers)  As a result the drop-off when he is on the court is much bigger, because the bench is better than it was. To give a similarish example, Cole Anthony has one of the absolute best on-offs in the entire league right now, not because he is a superstar in disguise (although he is very good) but because our bench is horrendously bad and lacks a true PG.  On-offs tell you as much about the replacement players as they do about the player themselves."
It‚Äôs a historically one-sided beef. It all started when Kanter was on the Knicks and him and Lebron got into an altercation because Lebron bumped Frank Ntilikina. Lebron then proceeded to shit on the Knicks with a dagger LeFuckYou 3 and never spoke to Kanter again lol
"how are mavs fans feeling about frankie ntilikina these days, I know he's been injured a few games and was hot and cold for a little bit the prior few games  just like to keep tabs on how my boy frank is doing"
ask frank ntilikina
y‚Äôall got Frank Ntilikina what more do u need
"imagine blowing your lottery picks on frank ntilikina and kevin knox and having your next FO clean up your mess by getting better players with 25th, 26th, 58th overall picks"
Every team has that guy though. Frank Ntilikina was that guy for us for years. When he was first drafted it was real but then he just became a meme after awhile.
Frank ntilikina
Better than Frank Ntilikina
Davion Mitchell is closer to Frank Ntilikina than Matisse Thybulle
The poor man‚Äôs Frank Ntilikina
After seeing Ntilikina play for us... I think they might lol. Frank looks like a completely different player.
He‚Äôs Frank Ntilikina with braids rn
"I mean at this point he‚Äôs basically Frank Ntilikina, hes really gotta step it up cause he was billed as NBA ready"
any mysterious raw lanky pg who has good defensive tools get dante exum/frank ntilikina comps
"With how quickly things move in this league a ""burner pick"" can still be really dangerous for a team tho. For reference, we couldve have Donovan Mitchell right now and frank ntilikina has a 2 year residency at the Dallas Institute for Wayward Knicks"
"I've only seen him play in the one kings v wolves game so far this season, but he sure looked like a defensive stud. Granted, it was only one game, but he looked like the definition of an active, highly annoying point-of-attack defender.   Idk what the point of this post is but I think he's gonna be miles better than Frank Ntilikina."
He has the 7th lowest TS in the NBA. He‚Äôs good on defense but being good on defense and useless on offense just makes you Frank Ntilikina.
Frank Ntilikina.
Hitting on good-but-not-great players with your lottery picks that often is still impressive. Not a single Frank Ntilikina or Kevin Knox among them!
"Well we lost but I was impressed with Frank Ntilikina once again. Picking him up was an absolute steal.   Really hope Bullock steps it up and starts hitting more shots (AND LAYUPS) though, he‚Äôs been disappointing so far compared to how he played for the Knicks last year. I like Reggie and have faith he will, but it‚Äôs frustrating right now. Never would have imagined I‚Äôd be saying Frank was the better Knicks acquisition at this point lol"
"That‚Äôs what a CP3/Booker team is going to do in the 4th. Our team fought well without Luka. Tough loss but some real questionable coaching decisions at the end.   Ntilikina was a huge bright spot. This is the first time we rlly saw him get real minutes defending elite guards. While Booker hit some tough shots, Frank did a great job when guarding him imo."
Can‚Äôt believe the knicks gave up on the goat Frank Ntilikina
Believe it or not Brunson and Frank Ntilikina are winning us tons of games
Scottie Barnes/Patrick Williams/Deandre Hunter/JJJ/Josh Jackson   Franz Wagner/Obi Toppin/Jaxson Hayes/Collin Sexton/Frank Ntilikina
"Our bench is very solid rn, its our starting lineup that lacks versatile players outside of Luka/KP. Frank Ntilikina has played very well, Reggie Bullock was a key starter for the Knicks last year, and we still have Maxi Kleber who was injured tonight.   But I'm convinced Dwight Powell is not even a 9th or 10th man in other teams rotations. Like you guys are 4-8 and both Poeltl and Eubanks are better than Powell. Even on non-playoff teams, I don't think Powell would deserve minutes. Our center rotation is BAD."
Frank the Tank Ntilikina üò§
Who woulda thought a Mavs fan would be singing Frank Ntilikina praises at the tail end of 2021? So glad to see my boy doing well.
"They have a lot of players that fit specific roles, they need another playmaker that is in the starting lineup. I think that is something that makes the bench team look better. Just the fact that they have a secondary ball handler in frank ntilikina. The 3 bench guards surround KP and Tim hardaway looked like the best lineup last night  Also doesn‚Äôt help that DFS has been shooting horribly."
They clearly missing Frank Ntilikina.
Frank the Tank lmaooo I will always love that nickname whether its Kaminsky or Ntilikina
"I thought Frank Ntilikina would become a player like Mike Conly, still think he can be a good rotation player on a good team."
Frank Ntilikina. Bust bust bust
"Frank ""The French Goat"" Ntilikina"
FRANK NTILIKINA
Frank Ntilikina
This is some revisionist bullcrap. The East had Michael Carter-Williams and Frank Ntilikina over that same period.
"LOL, that edit.  Feel the same way in any thread about the Mavs.                          I read an interesting thing somewhere about how strength is a huge deal for some young players.  Like, Lebron was a grown man at 18, but a lot of guys are nowhere near filled out yet.  Mavericks fans have been delighted by Frank Ntilikina this year, and part of the explanation for his delayed  development is that he was drafted at 18, and he's just one of those people who needs to get physically more mature before he can do anything against NBA adults.  (In Frank's case, it also has to do with his giant wingspan, and how having really long arms means flinging a ball toward a basket takes more force and is harder to control.)              Similarly, I remember seeing Jarrett Allen in person when he was at Texas, and thinking ""My god, he's a *kid*.""  I couldn't believe when he declared for the draft.  I think the Cavs got ahold of him at the exact right time.               Sorry to hear at Sexton.  Y'all are going to be frightening next year."
Bootum is too busy watching Frank Ntilikina bench mins on the Mavs
I'm high on Hayes but I also thought and said the similar things about Frank Ntilikina. He's obviously played far less games than Frank though
FRANK NTILIKINA Number One. Others are irrelevant
"and frank is like the 7th best player on their roster and is actually one of the bright spots this season for them.   I like frank so I hope he actually uses this opportunity to develop into a better player, he's still pretty young and could improve his game.  But yeah that's exactly it if frank ntilikina is getting big minutes then that really raises questions about the quality of guys you can put on the floor.   He was the 14th best player on the knicks last season and we cut him to make room for random prospects"
Knicks legend frank ntilikina
"They were better.  We had a great defense, but we didn't have a shut down guy who we could tell to go stop the best player on the other team.  There's a reason we were relying on *Frank Ntilikina* to get a stop against Trae Young when he hit the game winner.  Sixers had a guy like that, they just choked their ass off."
Frank Ntilikina
"Wait, what? I love Frank Ntilikina?!"
I‚Äôm really not convinced that a team that plays Frank Ntilikina significant minutes will be good.
Frank Ntilikina
"I thought it would be better than this at least, their starting lineup look like they have no idea how to play basketball and luka is just phoning it in since he got paid  the dallas sub is seriously asking them to consider starting frank ntilikina after 5 games.   on one hand it's nice frank is getting an opportunity, on the other hand if this is the best they can put on the floor thats a big yikes"
"Jeff Green and Rudy Gay  So far into his career, Frank Ntilikina"
you know you have roster problems when frank ntilikina is playing big minutes and he's not even close to the worst player on your team  frank will be starting for them at some point this season I bet.   he's playing better defense than some guys out there
"gonna get some big frank ntilikina minutes this game, put up a fat +20 in garbage time"
Nice. Now do Frank Ntilikina.
Shout out to Frank Ntilikina for playing great defense and hitting a few shots. He and Kleber were huge for us defensively.
