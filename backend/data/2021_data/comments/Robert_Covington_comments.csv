"Maybe casually isn't the word, but you don't move a generational talent (and Kyrie absolutely is, maybe not impact wise but the ceiling of what he's capable of) for Robert Covington and Steven Adams or anything like that. In this set up, when you've got to guard KD and Harden, Kyrie can probably eviscerate any defense in the playoffs. That's extremely valuable. He's a better shot-maker than Harden. You can get serviceable players before the playoffs start. The nets have shown that they can play okayish defense when they want to. They have a playable NBA center coming back (Claxton), they just signed an athletic big (pelle) and they just got Iman Shumpert. For all we know, that fixes a lot of their issues. They've been without a playable big man since getting James Harden. I just never saw the sense in giving up on the chance for the GOAT offense with zero chance of being stopped for a couple of guys who won't move the needle as much as you think in the playoffs, especially when the issues can be somewhat solved. Trading one of these guys rarely works out"
"If you're playing the nuggets, sixers, and Lakers it's going to be pretty important. I think you always need to have weakside rim protection but guys that excel at weakside rim protection aren't guaranteed to be good post defenders, like robert covington is good weakside rim protector but he's a poor post defender, there are tons of skinny long dudes who play really good help weakside defense but they're just too skinny to stop these massive dudes from backing them down, sometimes length and skill can compensate for that lack of strength in the post. A lot that goes into post defense is just raw strength and smarts. Typically though you need to run a drop coverage with really strong post defenders because they're too slow and top heavy to switch out on the perimeter which opens up 3 pt oppurtinies on pick and rolls.   Great teams that win championships typically can play every sort of defense at a high level and make adjustments throughout the game. The only outliers imo are the lebron miami and cleveland teams but some might argue Kevin love and tristan in combination are actually good enough and while the heat did play small they had udonis haslem who plays bigger than his size and they also had joel anthony. Chris Bosh wasn't exactly a pushover either and was kind've impossible to guard from the 5 even though he was kind've an afterthought.   GS best teams excelled at every type of defense for example. They always had the ability to go to draymond at the 5 for their switch heavy schemes and first they had bogut and then they had zaza to deal with good post up guys. Lakers are very similarly built this year. Raptors championship team was also built similarly with gasol and then switchy Ibaka at the 5."
Robert Covington 29 points
"Sixers connections to the g league are deep: Robert Covington spent a full season in the g league, Danny Green hung around there a couple months too.  Shake Milton putting up 15 a game this year after spending most of two seasons down in Delaware iirc."
"which is really useful tbf, but only if you look at it properly under that context  like we know Robert Covington isn’t a top 10 player in the league, but when he (or like, Donte Divincenzo last year) pops up at the top of those kind of stats, it’s good indicator that they’re succeeding really well at their role"
"Isn’t that what you asked though? He got called underrated so much that he’s now overrated? I honestly think Dame might be the second most overrated player in the league, after Robert ‘perfect 3&amp;D guy for any contender’ Covington"
"Blazer fan here. We basically brought in Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. to fill the vacated roles that Maurice Harkless and Al-Faruq Aminu filled during our WCF run a couple years ago. They are here to play good defense and if they can hit some shots on top of that great. Otherwise fine leave it to Dame, CJ, Gary and Melo. The more important and urgent matter other than Roco’s 3p% is the team health. Both Roco and DJJ are currently out with a concussion and a right quad contusion respectively. Hopefully we’ll get them both back in a week or two but we will still be missing Nurk and CJ for a while. To be clear Dame is literally our only healthy starter right now."
robert covington
Give me some sweet sweet Robert Covington. We need a 6'6-6'8 wing defender
"And the Rockets trading him away for nearly nothing always puzzled me.  The Rockets got:  * Robert Covington, 6.5 ppg, and no longer on the team.  * Jordan Bell, 3.0 ppg, deep bench player, not on team.  * And a 2024 second round draft pick from GSW."
"He also traded a first for Shumpert lol.  As for the Capela trade, Morey attached a first on him overall... Now Atlanta can get a first FOR him... Let me repeat, Morey traded a positive asset (Capela) and added a first on top of it and the piece he got back was Robert Covington. GTFO...  He also traded a second rounder for Caboclo."

Used to be Robert Covington
"Maxi Kleber, Draymond Green, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson come to mind"
&gt; Robert Covington  [Someone else had a similar question it looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fa70xd/what_is_robert_covingtons_middle_name/)
Does Robert Covington fit the bill? What’s his middle name??
"Let's say for example right, I haven't watched a single raptors game this season and probably won't unless they're playing the Lakers. Would I be wrong to look at your place in the standings and say hey, y'all should trade Lowry because your record is bad, he's an expiring contract and the best case scenario is for y'all to finish idk 7th,8th or in a play in game?  Can't I say the same thing about Vucevic? Hey the magic should probably trade this guy because they'll probably be in play in territory and it's better for them to have a lottery pick than to try and make the playoffs with this group that really doesn't look good on paper?  Can't I look at the box score and say hey, Robert Covington isn't doing much of anything right now. The last time we played him he looked like a decent help defender but he's not worth his contract, they should probably look to upgrade or hey, the deal to acquire him looks really bad right now.   Like how many games of these teams do I need to watch to be able to make the above statements? I don't think anyone needs to watch sixers or nuggets games to tell you Ben Simmons can't shoot from the perimeter and they should have traded him for Harden or that Murray hasn't played well since the bubble.   I'm sure there are certain circumstances where someone says something and they have no clue what they're talking about, but most of the takes I see on this sub aren't exactly baseless criticisms or require someone watching X team a lot.   I don't have to watch every Jazz game to tell you I don't think Gobert is worth 30M a year, I've seen him play before, paying 30M for a few screens in post defense that isn't good enough to slow down Jokic or AD isn't really worth it in the West."
"Dame, Brogdon, Justin Holiday/Derick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Sabionis. This team would play so well."
"Nets absolutely shouldn’t be, having a guard that can’t play off ball would be a disaster. They don’t need a playmaker, they need a three and d guy, think Marcus Smart, Robert Covington."

"I think he'll get the Robert Covington treatment sadly. Cov was legit one of the best defenders in the NBA when he was with us, but only got the recognition 3-4 years into his Philly career. Having said that, Dort seems to be more known because he can have offensive nights as well, which Cov rarely had."
Robert covington was a waste of a roster spot on my fantasy team this year
The number 3 pick in the draft is not a Hinkie find. The point of what he said was talking about guys that were undervalued and have developed.  A lot of guys played on the sixers with Hinkie.  Many of them were seen as developmental players.  Robert Covington is the guy most people talk about.  But there's now a bunch of players in the league that are valuable who were not on many radars until after working with the tanking 76ers.
"He was a great defensive coach with the Sixers. And he was Robert Covington's mentor, and Covington has given him a lot of credit in his development as a defender.    Shame to see him struggle in a head coaching capacity in Atlanta."
when you trade robert covington for picks that signaled to me theyre done trying to compete.
George Hill  Seth Curry  Duncan Robinson  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez
Robert Covington does not want to play center again.
"BPA&gt;Fit has backfired too.   ATL drafted ""BPA"" Marvin Williams when they already had Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, Al Harrington, and Josh Childress as wings. In doing so, they passed up ""better fit"" prospects like Chris Paul and Deron Williams, even though they badly needed a PG.   Then the next year they drafted another ""BPA"" forward, Shelden Williams, instead of ""better fit"" Brandon Roy. By the time they realized their mistake, they had to trade Shelden Williams for a washed, overpaid Mike Bibby.   Or how about MIN drafting 2 ""BPA"" PGs in a row (Rubio, Johnny Flynn)? Or the Clippers drafting 2 PFs in a row (Chris Wilcox, Melvin Ely), when they already had Elton Brand and Chris Kaman?   DET drafted BPA Darko when they already had Ben Wallace at C, instead of better fit Chris Bosh to replace Elden Campbell (though they eventually traded for Sheed to fill the PF spot).   PHI went BPA Fultz when they already had Simmons at PG, instead of better fit Tatum to replace Robert Covington/Dario Saric.   MIL chose BPA Jabari Parker when they already had Giannis at PF, instead of better fit Embiid to replace Zaza Pachulia.   NY picked Jordan Hill when they already had David Lee at PF, instead of better fit Demar Derozan to replace Jared Jeffries.   UTA picked BPA Trey Lyles when they already had Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors at forward, instead of better fit Devin Booker to replace Rodney Hood.   ORL drafted BPA Mo Bamba when they already had Vucevic at C, instead of better fit Collin Sexton to replace DJ Augustin.  You can find examples to support either approach. There's no single correct way."
"Avery Bradley, Seth Curry, Robert Covington, Jae Crowder, Shaq"
This is more uncomfortable than a Robert Covington layup attempt
"Yeah but we also went to the WCF finals with no Nurk though and most people would consider Robert Covington and Derick Jones Jr. better players than Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless (ask Heat fants) who they are replacing the roles of from that team, Gary Trent has also made a big jump this year, Melo is shooting 40% plus from 3, Rodney Hood is still working his way back into form but will be there by the postseason, CJ is playing the best basketball of his career (and its mostly by adding 5 or so 3 point attempts a game so its sustainable).  Last year Nurk was out until the bubble and then still with barely any conditioning coming back and the team had no Kanter or Hood or Covington or DJJ and it was pretty much Melo or Mario Herzonja on the wing.   There is a reason people view them as a bigger threat this year. Upgrading your best players from 4-8 and getting your 3rd best player back (eventually with Nurk, he's also not in his normal game shape yet)  Right now the team is still waiting on Nurk to get back to his usual self and still winning at a decent clip which will only keep going up as they play together more and as Hood gets back into form"
"The key is 3 point shooting volume. There are guys like PJ Tucker and Robert Covington who just have very limited offensive skills beyond spot up shooting. But they shoot 3s at volume. If you think Thybulle can get to 34-35% on 5 3's a game with his defense even if he does dick on offense beyond that it's at least a rotation player. Maybe not as good as Robert Covington but Robert Covington is really valuable.   I agree the rest of his offensive skillset is horrendous, and that people only conceive of 3+D guys in terms of shooting and ignoring everything else which is a flaw in analysis. I also think Thybulle has enough defensive potential where he can be a relative exception to the rule in that regard.   Just comes down to the difference between pretty good defense+average shooting+no other offensive skills vs top tier defense + average shooting + no other offensive skills."
Thybulle has already shown elite defensive skill and he’s a solid one cut slasher too. He’s got Robert Covington potential.
"You don't understand the point. He's going to make that money regardless - he's on a guaranteed contract and you think Adidas will drop him b/c he's averaging 25 instead of 32? obviously not.   The only people who are suffering b/c of Harden is Houston, which is entirely their fault for not trading him. If they don't like how he's acting maybe they shouldn't have traded away players like Robert Covington to save money"
i would legitimately get into shouting matches with people about how valuable Robert Covington is. some sixers fans were absurdly negative about him because of his streaky shooting and it annoyed me irrationally lmao.
"Westbrook may suck now but he was really good last year.   John wall only has maybe 1 year better than him in 17 wall and walls not going be 17 wall again even though he’s had some good games.  Like westbrook, not a good fit with harden.  Someone like Beverley was ideal and Paul was fine not having the ball sometimes and contributing in other ways.  Robert Covington is back to underrated again.  No he’s not the defender he was in Philly but he was their best defender last year and really the reason why small ball defended so well."
they also lost key contributors in Robert Covington and Austin Rivers
"He was shitty as hell for you guys after you got him. Then he had 50/50/85 splits in the playoffs. That sort of streakiness is just life with Robert Covington. He always brings it defensively, though, so everyone loves him regardless."
PG: Kemba Walker SG: Caris LeVert SF: Tobias Harris PF: Robert Covington  C: Jusuf Nurkic
"robert covington, i love him to death, but he cant dribble a single time or its off his foot"
Our 2018-2019 we won 36 games and only well apart once Rose and Robert Covington got injured but we had legitimate chance at making the playoffs.  And last season wouldn't have been nearly as bad had KAT not been injured. Even then if KAT can carry that roster why can't Wiggins?
They don’t wanna get run over. Did u see what happened to Robert Covington a couple nights ago
They don’t wanna get run over like what happened to Robert Covington a couple of nights ago lol
"My interest in the Sixers took a huge hit when we traded away Dario and Robert Covington. People called me stupid, said we were so much better. Then we got knocked out of the second round again.  I really wanted to care about the Horford Sixers but last year just felt like a waste of time"
Robert Covington.
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
"Aaah, the good ole Robert Covington special"
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."

Robert Covington
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."
"The Blazers traded two firsts for Robert Covington when they could’ve just drafted Saddiq Bey, who’s basically Robert Covington Jr."
ROBERT COVINGTON AND DERRICK JONES JUNIOR BUD.
What’s wrong with Robert Covington?
"There's a reason he's now on his 4th team in 3 years, and it's because the idea of Robert Covington is nowhere close to what he actually is.  The guy can't create his own shot, and his defense is overrated. We gave up 2 first round picks for him and he's averaging 6 points per game while shooting under 30% from 3. I know it's still early, but he has not been impressive in the slightest so far."
"Why did people think the Blazers were going to be much better than last season? Because of Robert Covington, who can't play defense? Imo, if they're legitimately able to trade for Harden, they should do it because this team is going to be fighting for the 8 seed again by the end of the season and more likely than not, Dame will be bailing them out."
"Robert Covington is so important to this blazers team, his shots need to start falling. First game all year with double digit scoring, and his shot was off in that second half when the bulls came back."
"Nobody cares about pickup games you play with random bums. We’re talking about basketball at the highest level, and on this level an offence that has role players attempt a high volume of mid-range shots is gonna suck and be competent unable to keep up with teams that actually play correctly.   Sure, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker can take a lot of them because they’re actually good shooters. Danny Green and Robert Covington and like 90% of role players should be shooting threes or layups almost exclusively because 40% mid-range shooting is terrible."
Robert Covington
He's Robert Covington.  Which again is a fine 4th best player on a title contender.
[“Robert Covington handle”](https://youtu.be/SQAr8i8UWDU)

"PG: Ish Smith/TJ McConnell  SG: Robert Covington/Tony Wroten  SF: Jerami Grant/Nik Stauskas  PF: Christian Wood/Jahlil Okafor  C: Richaun Holmes/Nerlens Noel  Team would still be pretty bad, but they'd at least be competitive these days."
"2017 they still had Kristaps, Noah (of course he became a tire fire but at the time there was still some hope he could be at least solid), Frank Ntilikina (who was just drafted with high hopes)   2018 Knicks had DeAndre Jordan, Dennis Smith Jr. (thought to be a future star), Frank Ntilikina (who still had more hope back then) and Mitchell Robinson   76ers:  2013: ROY MCW, Nerlens Noel (granted he was hurt but still had that hope)  2014: Noel, Robert Covington, Joel Embiid (missed year but still carried massive hope)   2015: Noel, Covington, Embiid (still hurt), Jalil Okafor (was still an all rookie guy with upside at time)  2016: Covington, Embiid, Saric (decently regarded draft and stash guy playing his first year), Simmons (hurt the whole year but still was a hopeful impact guy)   Nets 10 years ago had Brook Lopez"
Harden and Robert Covington are both wings.
Chris Paul  James Harden  Robert Covington  PJ Tucker  Christian Wood
"Robert Covington, gives him tons of spacing and elite switch defense."
"To improve on the team that made the ECF last season we really just need Kemba healthy. The Jays have stepped up in a big way. Tatum, Brown and (healthy) Kemba is looking like a really strong top 3.   To take the next step, we're one starting level wing short and it means we're asking for a lot from everyone. We're relying on our top-end talent having huge nights every night and we play a lot of bad lineups that end up costing us games.    All of our main bench players are individually good when they're playing with the starters. The issue is when we play our bench players with other bench players.   Grant Williams is a great example, he looks good playing next to Kemba, Smart, Brown, Tatum. He looks pretty bad when he's playing next to 2-3 other Grant Williams.    We could chase a secondary star, but even just 1 decent wing would take a lot of pressure off our guys.   Eg:  * Robert Covington * Otto Porter Jr * Jae Crowder * Harrison Barnes * Terrence Ross * etc etc  Our bench players are good fill-ins but 1 more starting wing would mean we don't have to play so many lineups that have a bench majority."
Nope  We traded pick and Robert Covington for  Christian Wood  DET pick  POR pick

Ok Wizards GM. Tell me why you didn’t trade for Robert Covington then
I guess ideally you'd have Robert Covington next to him. A guy who can primarily guard a wing but is an elite help-defender at the rim. But there aren't a lot of those guys in the league

Robert Covington is such a great guy. He’s a great example of giving back to your community!
Robert covington was in the skills challenge though
Sounds like Robert Covington at the small ball 5 (just the stats)
In the regular season off ball defense is more valuable.  In the playoffs in specific match ups individual defenders like an OG Anunoby become more important than the Robert Covington type
"I really appreciate that the NBA has used the All Star Weekend as a platform to support and raise awareness of the importance of HBCUs, but did they really have to add *Robert Covington* to the Skills Competition (presumably because he’s the only player to have graduated from a HBCU)?"
It seems Robert Covington wants the few minutes of fame.
"CP should wipe the floor with this group....so naturally congrats to Robert Covington, your Taco Bell Skills 2021 Champion"
"I would've killed to be in the room when the NBA decided to put Covington in the skills competition  ""So here's my idea, as a nod to HBCUs we put the lone HBCU alum in the skills competition""  ""I love it, who is it?""  ""It's uh...it's Robert Covington...""  *crickets"
Robert Covington really going all the way to Atlanta just to do this
Imagine doubting Robert Covington. He's about to wipe the floor with these nobodies.
Of course it makes sense to put Julius Randle and Robert Covington in the skills contest. /s
"Christian Wood, Robert Covington, Jeremi Grant, there's actually quite a few"
"How do you even fix Jokic's glaring defensive deficiencies?  Pick up a talented and versatile 6' 8""+ two-way player  that can check small ball fives and has the length and lateral quickness to rotate swiftly from the weak side corner to help contest interior shots?  How many of those players are even available?   Robert Covington, Christian Wood, and John Collins?  Oh, wait, they allowed someone who fit that mold perfectly that shined in the bubble to simply walk away."
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
"Robert Covington. Ever since RoCo started wearing 23 earlier this year he has had been so many iconic moments. MJ was good, but at this pace RoCo might just edge out Terry Porter for the greatest of all time."
"&gt; defensive system   You mean relying on Enes Kanter (and wait, Robert Covington himself) to protect the paint?"
"We've been discussing PDX being elite for years upon years.    Other teams who were meddling teams just 2-3 years ago are surpassing them now.  The only person who moves the needle on PDX is Robert Covington seeing how he's going to be defending the best SFs come playoff time.  If he doesn't show up, they'll get destroyed."
"ok for the sake of simplifying this argument, there are 24 all stars every year, right? Take a look at last years all stars and tell me which 4 Robert Covington is better than"
"Robert Covington is the best example, he's so so so good as an help defender for a forward, but on ball he's almost powerless wether it's against guards or power wings.  On the other end of the spectrum guys like OG Anonoby or Lou Dort are absolute lockdown on ball, but not that special as help defenders.  &amp;#x200B;  If I had to do top 5 I'd say on ball (perimeter players only):  1. OG Anunoby 2. Ben Simmons 3. Lou Dort 4. Marcus Smart 5. Kawhi  Off Ball/help defender  1. Smart 2. Simmons 3. Tatum 4. Covington 5. Mikal Bridges  Lebron can be the best off ball defender when he's into it, I won't lie I haven't really watched him enough this season to say how he's been, also possible that Kawhi has slept and I just didn't notice, kudos to Royce O'Neal (on ball), Dejounte Murray (on and off the ball), Thybulle (off ball, didn't include him in the top 5 because he doens't play enough for me, but could be THE best), Jrue (on ball), Kyle Anderson (off ball), Jae'Sean Tate (on ball), Wiggins (on ball).  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure that I forgot a big name"
I'm thinking of who the underrated power forward would be. I don't know if Robert Covington is underrated or not but he feels like he'd be a good fit in this lineup
"I'm admittedly very low on Langford but my point still stands in trying to draft older, win-now players next to your two stars.  I'd have to sit and think on a list but I'll take someone like Robert Covington for example. Your sub is begging the Kings to give up Harrison Barnes and Covington would've been a somewhat comparable player at the 4 who went for two firsts."
"He gets voted in because that's who the fans wanted to see - not because his team is better. They're both putting up incredible stats and I wasn't going to be mad if Lillard made it over Luka, but to use team record is a bit disingenuous as Covid ravaged our starting lineup (literally made us play like 6 or 7 games with 5 players out when teams now get to have their games postponed) and Gary Trent Jr/Robert Covington would be the 2nd/3rd best players on our team right now (Brunson would be the 4th best)."
"He's getting super open shots because teams don't respect his shot and it's not going to be a deciding factor in many games. No one's going to devote on-court resources to defending his shot, it's not worth it. And again, any good defense can dry up those shots. I truly hope he goes to a playoff team so it'll give people a chance to understand what playoff defenses do to these types of ""shooters."" To be clear, the reason he's a ""shooter"" at all is b/c he can't do much else in the half court. This is like Robert Covington shooting. yeah he shoots 3's b/c he doesn't have a role elsewhere, not because he's actually dangerous from there.  To my comment on whether he's ""3 &amp; D,"" I guess that depends on what level of 3 point shooting and defense you expect. A guy who can't force the defense into a difficult decision over whether to guard him or the basket doesn't satisfy the 3 point requirement in my book. That's why he gets these super open looks that pump up his % in the first place."
"The Blazers roster around Dame for most of this season has been Robert Covington, Gary Trent, Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Jones, Anfernee Simons, Rodney Hood, and Harry Giles..."
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
"Robert Covington seems kinda overrated, he’s a nice piece yeah but not a game changer like people always talk about him as"
Robert Covington defense! haha
"What? Who ever said he was unplayable? IIRC people thought he was underpaid when the Rockets re-signed him, then thought the Rockets were dumb to give him up for Robert Covington and triple down on small ball last year. Maybe there are few people who were overhyping the death of the C, but I think most everyone here thought he was a good player."
Robert Covington is possessed by Klay Thompson rn
what the hell.  Luka was cooking and we get THJ isolating vs Robert Covington at the end of the quarter.
"im just saying you cant claim celtics are win now mode when they literally havent made one trade for a win now move. look at the nets trading for a guy like shamet, or clippers trading for morris. Even the portland trailblazers traded two firsts for robert covington. Celtics have not traded any firsts for a vet."
"I was being serious. I want to know OP’s definition of a role player so I can answer the fucking question. If they think Robert Covington and Aaron Gordon are Role Players, then The next step up from them would be borderline all-star quality players."
"That’s a good point. It’d be interesting to look through the stats after this season though. I’m curious if COVID and the lack of training camp is gonna cause more wild swings than normal.   There’s also different kinds of good shooters. The first is guys that are super hot and cold like Danny Green, Robert Covington, or Jamal Murray (or me on a much worse scale, lol). The second type of guys who are just always consistently good, but don’t necessarily reach the same peaks as the guys from the first category, like JJ Reddick. I’m not sure which is more valuable."
The idea of Robert Covington is the reality of Royce O’neale
"Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like the idea of Robert Covington is better than the reality. I *loved* the Blazers picking him in the offseason; in theory, he’s the perfect 3 and D player, a guy who doesn’t need the ball on offense but is switchable and versatile on defense. But he’s a fairly average three point shooter (below average the past few seasons) who doesn’t contribute many other ways on offense. On defense, he’s a good player, but not a great one; he’s occasionally guilty of ball-watching and can’t really switch onto small guards or centers. I think the reality is that Covington is closer to Wes Matthews: a good defensive piece who’s a generally good shooter. I think that’s a valuable piece to have, but he’s not the difference maker fans (including myself) have thought he would be."
"Underrated:  * Royce O’Neal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It’s like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
Robert Covington cause I can shoot and play D but if I put it all on the floor it’s an automatic turnover
"I know the podcast is hilarious but Caruso is not an ""elite"" role player. That's like a Robert Covington.  Caruso is not as good as Dellavadova and I don't think I've heard shit about him in years."
Robert Covington sounds like a jousting champion
Can someone explain why Robert covington went from a stud last year to a sucker this year?
ROBERT COVINGTON WITH NO REGARD FOR ~~HUMAN LIFE~~ TEAM SOLIDARITY
I am soooo tired of watching people freak over their center as they destroy Enes Kanter Harry Giles and Robert Covington.  God I just want Nurkic and Collins back
ROBERT COVINGTON WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
"Sleeper agent, Robert Covington. Been trusting The Process since day 1. /s  In all seriousness, I hope Kanter doesn’t need stitches for that cut"
Embiid is good. But embiid is getting guarded by enes kanter and now robert covington. relax
Sixers legend Robert Covington vs Blazers legend Seth Curry
"Even worse, they traded Robert Covington for Jaden McDaniels and Ricky Rubio and traded Dario Saric to move up 5 slots in the draft to pick Jarrett Culver"

"I think wings can impact a ton if they play help defense, provide secondary rim protection etc.  But Kawhi didn't do that, he didn't need to do it, because he often played with 2 rim protectors + Danny Green who is/was a solid help defender for a wing.  Wing stopper get more important in a playoff series, against specific match ups. But that's why for example a guy like Robert Covington (before this year, he sucks this year) can be more ""valuable"" defensively in the regular season than guys who are way way way better than him on ball"
"Like the Lakers switching Robert Covington onto LeBron in the playoffs. It doesn’t mean Roco is a bad defender, but he’s best as a help defender so switching him onto the ballhandler takes away his greatest strength of help defense"
Trade God Morey making a bonkers 4-teamer all to get Robert Covington for one season.
Robert Covington
"Danny Green, Shane Battier, Robert Covington. 3&amp;D are still underrated.   Also: Rudy Gobert"
"Uh, yes? Draymond averages 8 assists a game.   Wanna know how many assists Dames second leading playmaker averaged in those 30 games CJ and Nurkic were out?  1.7. It was robert covington lmao"
I’m ok with the city getting excited. Its the loud ass hot takes from people who couldn’t tell me who Robert Covington is that piss me off.   Don’t bitch to me about Simmon’s offensive production unless you shared our agony over Jah being hot garbage. Tell me about Totally Normal Collars first.
Sir Robert Covington does not need more arc on his 3
"It is a populated position and yet it isn't, because there aren't many players who fit squarely into the 3&amp;D mold.  They can't be too good on offense or they will be more than just 3&amp;D.  Kawhi Leonard started his career as a 3&amp;D player, but now is a bonafide superstar.  Is Klay Thompson a 3&amp;D player?  Some would say he's too good for that as well.  If he's still a 3&amp;D player, he's the best when healthy -- but maybe he's too good.  But they also have to balance excellent and frequent three point shooting with excellent defense, and not be too much of one or the other. The problem is that three point shooting can be volatile.  Robert Covington has always been considered a premier 3&amp;D player, but last year his three point shooting deserted him, as he only hit 33.5% of his threes.  Yet this year he's back near 40%.  The other problem is that catch-and-shoot three point shooters may not score much.  Despite his good three point shooting percentage this year, Covington is mostly a great defender who scores 9 points a game.  He makes one assist and one turnover per game.  So his real contribution on offense is small. How much does a 3&amp;D player have to score to be considered an offensive asset, and if he scores 20 points per game like Klay Thompson is he too good to be called a 3&amp;D player?  I'm just saying it's not easy to define whether someone is a true 3&amp;D players, yet not a star.  Lots of players are loosely placed in that category, but most of them have strengths and weaknesses that makes the classification suspect."
"Robert Covington. His versatility and impact on D this season are top-tier, and he's shooting 40% from 3.  Edit: OG Anunoby, too. Who has been slightly less effective on D, but more versatile than RoCo, and is also shooting 40%.  https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1378781381896114178"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"Give me Bobby Portis, Boris Diaw or a player like Robert Covington."
Robert Covington is the fucking GOAT my goodness
"&gt;Harden  The Rockets in 2015-16 were pretty bad (Dwight had started to decline). Trevor Ariza as his 2nd best player along with Dwight. Pat Bev as third best player?   Even last year, the Rockets beat the Thunder with Harden having a pretty terrible supporting cast. Eric Gordon and Robert Covington were probably the next 2 best players (and see how terrible they look without Harden). I mean the team fell apart without Danuel House. Westbrook was an absolute disaster in the playoffs.   Harden because of his style can minimize the negative impact of the supporting cast better than Steph can.   Apart from 2017-18 Harden never had a great supporting cast (CP3 had a weird decline in 2018-19)."
"Yeah they were signing guys who had no business being in the NBA like TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Jakarr Sampson, Christian Wood"
Robert covington
"Yes. As someone who watched way too many Wolves games, yes RoCo is good but we definitely got more than he was worth in the trade. His defense is definitely great, but a tad overrated. And he played pretty much at his peak in Houston (which was a perfect fit for him), which still wasn't enough to get them past the Lakers buzzsaw. Wiggins was instrumental in our early season success last year. I'd expect us to do better on a night without Cov than a night without Wiggins (which wasn't really the case in 18-19 tbh).   Basically the argument comes down to this for me: would you rather have Robert Covington as the best player on your team, or Andrew Wiggins as your best player? It's pretty obviously Wiggins. Same argument can be applied if you make them the 2nd best player, 3rd best, etc. Yes they have different roles, but Wiggins is the better player and their contracts should really be the only thing that makes it debatable (in which case I'd rather have Cov on his current contract than Wig's)."
"I'm not really sure how good a defense a coach is realistically expected to generate with Dame, CJ, Robert Covington, Gary Trent Jr. Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter lead the team in minutes so far this season.   Some of that is on the coach for managing rotations, but a lot of that is injuries and personnel."
And how dare they develop gems like Robert Covington and Kork to be solid rotation players in the playoffs
"we got him in a 4 team trade that got the rockets Robert Covington. He’s a beast and our defensive anchor, 4th best player on the team."
Am I insane or is that Robert Covington?
this is gonna sound random but i oddly confuse him and robert covington
I’d like to nominate Jrue Holiday and Robert Covington
LeBron and 14 Robert Covington
Take our robert covington and put in og. Roco is a good team defender but an avg man to man defender
Who is good if KP isn't good. Like is Robert Covington good? What are your standards man
Why is Robert Covington on here? Blazers defense is ass
Lol good.   Houston already fucked the rest of the west over handing you Robert Covington for peanuts.
"Yeah rockets got played. ""Robert covington was amazing"" lol where is he now"
"True, Giannis give you much of what Robert covington give you and some."
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
Morey traded that dude AND a 1st for Robert Covington lmao
Robert Covington and TJ Warren
"Hinkie would personally drive players to the airport.   The process gave guys a chance who may have never gotten a chance elsewhere. TJ McConnell and Robert Covington, along with many others, may have never played any real nba minutes if not for the process"
"Long time first time wassup? I can set aside the sports rivalry for a minute to recognize another team losing their home grown boys. I can't imagine if Philly won a ring with Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Landry Shamet, etc how I'd feel if they had to leave after."

Draymond Green and Robert Covington. No pass is safe.
"Sixers never sat guys like Horford or SGA.  Brett Brown Developed guys like Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel etc."
They did develop a lot of their players to be NBA players though. They just didn’t have the superstar to build around.   TJ McConnell  Jakar Sampson   Richaun Holmes   TImothy Lu Cabborot   Robert Covington  Jerami Grant   Christian Wood   And those are just the late Undrafted players lol
"The process was 3 years and the worst of those years gave opportunities to a lot of guys who wouldn’t have made it otherwise. That 10 win team featured TJ McConnell, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Jakarr Sampson, Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes who have all signed second contracts and established themselves in this league"
"&gt;He was on record for not even wanting to be a Laker and it's contract year so yeah he has that kind of pull.  Not according to Vogel.  ""“I haven’t made any final decisions on that. It’s definitely something I want to look at,” Vogel told reporters on Wednesday, via Ryan Ward of Lakers Daily. See how he and LeBron look together sharing the ball-handling responsibilities.”  &gt;It's a fact that Marc is an all nba first team and DPOY no amount of your tears will change that  Riiight.  And the Knicks traded Smith and a second for the League MVP.  &gt;Because they wanted that 6MOY award and or they're more comfortable coming off the bench.  Riiight. That prestigious award that Schroder does not want.  In addition to being unaware of most of the facts here, consistency is an area that you are struggling in.  'Course, you didn't even know that he had not won it, until I told you.  So if I'm ""a casual"", and you know far less than I do, what does that make you?  &gt;Robert Covington and Joe Ingles come to mind, roco was cut at training camp by houston and Ingles by the clippers both quality players.  Both were cut before playing even 8 games, not after 100+ like Jones and McKinnie.  &gt;I mean it is correct since it's a fact that the Lakers are currently the deepest team in nba history  The Lakers are not even the deepest team currently playing out of the Staples Center.    And I already educated you on what a historically-deep NBA roster looks like, so your continued ignorance of that is, as you earlier put at, ""a very bad look"".  Try harder, you are embarrassing yourself."
"On-Off defensive rating differential.      A stat the effectively looks at how many points fewer per 100 possessions teams score when a player is on the court compared to on the bench.

"I don't understand how I'm seeing all these trade rumors for Portland talking about how they need to trade for a defensive player to help.  They added Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr in the off-season, two of the better wing/big hybrid defenders in the league.   They have also missed their defensive anchor (Nurkic) for most of the season.  Shouldn't they be focusing on what they do have versus what they don't?"

It's a fact that Marc is an all nba first team and DPOY no amount of your tears will change that.   Because they wanted that 6MOY award and or they're more comfortable coming off the bench.

"Full piece  *""Gersson Rosas made no secret when he took the job as Timberwolves president that the primary way he was going to restructure the Wolves was through trades. Minnesota has never been a free-agent destination in the NBA, and Rosas wasn't naive enough to think he could change that overnight for big-ticket players. Instead, trades, the way Rosas' former team in Houston became a contender in landing James Harden, were going to drive the roster overhaul.  		  D'Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Juancho Hernangomez, Ricky Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt all came to the Wolves via trade, and the draft pick that eventually turned into Jaden McDaniels also came in a trade.  The March 25 trade deadline is nearing, and reports are circulating of the Wolves' reported interest in Atlanta's John Collins and, to a lesser extent, Orlando's Aaron Gordon. Hall of Fame NBA reporter Jackie MacMullan said on Bill Simmons' podcast recently that she heard from sources the Wolves were ""dying"" to get Collins.   ""Just as Rosas made clear trades were the primary way he was going to reshape the roster and then followed up on that, when reports have emerged about Rosas' pursuit of a given target, fire typically has followed the smoke. The Wolves never gave up on their pursuit of Russell, and their interest both in the 2019 offseason and before the February 2020 trade deadline was public knowledge. Even as reports varied about the state of negotiations in the days leading to the trade, in the end the Wolves dealt Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick for Russell.  Before Robert Covington was traded, it was an open secret the Wolves were shopping him, as some national writers strongly hinted in the days leading up to the four-team gargantuan trade that netted the Wolves Beasley, Hernangomez, Vanderbilt and a draft pick.  Now the same dance seems to be happening with Collins, who will be a restricted free agent after the season but is reportedly looking for a max contract. Trading for Collins now ensures the Wolves would secure his Bird Rights, as they did with Beasley and Hernangomez, and would also ultimately control whether he re-signs in restricted free agency, but just what might that cost? Would the Wolves have the room to keep him?  Would part of that cost come in another first-round pick? Since the Wolves owe Golden State a top-three-protected first-round pick this year — and there's a chance the Wolves land in the top three and the (unprotected) pick conveys in 2022 — they can't deal a first-round pick until 2024, as the NBA doesn't allow teams to deal first-round picks in consecutive years.  Perhaps it's just as well the Wolves are hamstrung in dealing first-round picks, considering they may finish this season with a record that gives Golden State a 60% chance of retaining a pick that falls between No. 4 and No. 7. The Wolves were hoping when they dealt the pick that it would be somewhere in the teens, not the top 10.  The way this season has gone, the pressure has built on Rosas to make another move on a roster that still needs building. All the games the Wolves had to play without Russell, Karl-Anthony Towns or both have made that clear. Towns also won't want to play in a state of constant rebuild for long. Trade deadlines and offseasons are the time tectonic roster shifts can happen, and Rosas has pulled the plug on multiple moves in the past two cycles. This deadline promises more of the same. The signs are there, and Rosas is likely to make a move of some kind. As time goes on in Rosas' tenure and the Wolves continue losing, there's more riding on each move Rosas makes.  He has shown he won't sit quietly as the NBA turns around the Wolves, but making the right move is more paramount than ever in his tenure.""*  Chris Hine covers the Timberwolves and NBA for the Star Tribune. chris.hine@startribune.com"
"I think he'll get there but a lot of media will vote for him ""by default"" and  it will be unfair because he's been legit great.  But yeah he might be hurt because the value he has on defense isn't the tradionnal wing stopper, he's almost doing what a guy like Robert Covington did (while being way better on ball of course) but sometimes people underrate how important help defense can be especially on the wing"
"&gt;So you’re saying they elevate their team by creating scoring opportunities for teammates? Which is directly the result of Steph playing off ball? Just a different play style?  Dame and Harden on ball creates more and better looks than Steph off ball.  &gt;Nobody who watches Steph Curry play basketball thinks this doesn’t occur pretty much every time he crosses half court. He is doubled constantly at the same distance and the rest of the team does to 5 v 4.  But he plays more off-ball....so it happens much less frequently.   &gt;You said above average. Those are the words you said lmao.  14 &gt;15. It's technically true, but you're also arguing semantics my man. Look at the roster Dame carried to the #2 offense last season.  &gt;That’s genuinely a much better offensive supporting cast than what Steph is working with now. Steph would murder somebody to play with CJ McCollum.  Is it the difference between 22nd and 2nd on offense? Think we both know that's a no  Dame would also murder someone to play with a guy like Draymond that can carry the defense and facilitate...cause Dame has literally no one on the entire roster than can pass.  Robert Covington at 1.8 APG is literally second on the team lol"
"As a heat fan, We rely on Jimmy too much, If Bam develops a shot , and our younger guys like Herro, Nunn, and Achiuwa keep developing we would be in a much better spot. While we're on the topic, if we got better big defenders it would also help astronomically, like Why is Kelly Olynyk still on our roster, and the fact that we have him and Meyers leonard who is pretty much him but worse is stupid.  They space the floor, but aren't great at it, and the amount of layups i've seen Olynyk miss is insane. A guy like Robert Covington would be so much better, similar to Jae Crowder last year; has good defense and can knock down a 3. The height advantage by Leonard and Olynyk is pretty much useless because they are worse perimeter defenders in a 3 point/perimeter oriented league."
Is his trade value lower than Robert Covington last November who was about to turn 30?

robert covington? I agree
"I’m sorry but this is just full blown nephew takes. Not going to even bother responding anymore who thinks adding Robert Covington to the blazers suddenly makes the capable of beating lebron James in the playoffs,"
"I really don’t think you know what objectively means.   You’re objectively wrong, we have actually seen Covington try to guard lebron and AD in the playoffs and it wasn’t good.  &gt;which Portland had against LA  They were getting blown out by 15 or 20 most those games. At least watch the series if you’re going to talk about it. In some of those games lebron and AD didn’t even break 25 minutes. Robert Covington isn’t going to make a difference in a 20 point blow out"
Blazers weren’t ever going to actually compete with the lakers. It took the lakers shooting a historically awful sub 20% from three but after that they blew the doors off of them. Adding Robert Covington doesn’t move the needle at all and he didn’t do shit to help the rockets against AD/bron.   Sorry to rain on your parade but saying Robert Covington will help guard lebron/AD is as laughable as the 2017 raptors picking up pj tucker to be a “lebron stopper”
Yeah I see the comparison. Defensive specialist 3/4.  My comparison for his floor is Robert Covington. He has the streaky shooting that can be developed and fantastic instincts

"If I look at the 70 players who have played at least 1000 minutes this season, the top 15 in Def RAPTOR are:  Rudy Gobert, myles turner, Robert covington, Luguentz Dort, Fred Vanvleet, Nic Batum,  Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Julius Randle, Bam adebayo , royce O'Neal, Justin holiday, Ben Simmons, Kelly oubre, DeAndre ayton  This is littered with players who are either great individual defenders, or at least do a great job playing a defensive role in a solid system (FVV, Julius Randle, for example)   Wiggins ranks 25th out of those 70 players for the record - so hes fine enough but I can't buy all this talk that hes elite on that end   Also fair to note that he is ranked 67th out of those 70 players in offensive RAPTOR , right behind Anthony Edwards. So there's that"
Nah bro Dario Saric and Robert Covington are studs and way better than anyone Dwight ever played with!!!
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)   I’m not calling Dirk Nowitzki, Rodman, Barkley, or Robert Covington a “big man” AD is a Power Foward with the skills of a Center, but he is not a Center. Therefore he is not a big man."
Barnes is becoming this year's Robert Covington. Rock solid player that is gonna get overhyped around the trade deadline to the point that fans of the team that eventually gets him is gonna be slightly disappointed
"It will come across as hating but it's 100% the 6ers.   I feel like Boston/Toronto get graded on a similar level. We had the 1a/1b defence in 2016-17 and we were lucky to get a 2nd team All-D nomination and I know Toronto generally gets overlooked as well.   When it comes to Philly, people kind of forget there's a difference between being a great defender and a DPOY candidate.   * Embiid is perenially top 5 in DPOY voting (honestly deserved) * Robert Covington was top 5 in DPOY (and the second he left he wasn't even All-D) * Simmons is top 5 in DPOY voting * There are talks about Matisse one day being top 5 in DPOY voting   They have some great defenders but they don't have *Prime Rudy + Prime Draymond + Prime Kawhi* and that's the level when we're talking about a team having multiple DPOY candidates."
"Talk about the refs all you want, but in a 1 point game, Robert Covington missed 2 consecutive free throws. Refs may have been bad, but just making one of those free throws would've made a huge difference."

"To add to this, Robert Covington was one of the first signees of the Process, and wasn't a Sixers asset pre-process.      Like u/broke-collegekid said above, he was not a positive NBA player at that time. He was one of the most important players from the process era, but was not an above average NBA player at the start."
"and Robert Covington, and TJ McConnell. Calling these guys mediocre is absolutely slander. Everyone who's not an all time great is mediocre now?"
"They have so many picks coming in. Those players will have more potential and will be cheaper than the boarder line NBA players they are sending out there.   I know the goals of tanking, I watched the process Sixers. But I also saw all the Sixers fans gushing over guys like Tony Wroten. Every now and then you’ll find a guy like Robert Covington, but not every player needs a great number NBA minutes for you to realize they are end of the bench players."
"Well it becomes ""is this the game they win?!"".  Plus they had dudes that were trying to make it in the NBA.  So they weirdly showed a lot of heart.  They just weren't good.  We found Robert covington who played his way into an NBA role.  Tj McConnell as well.  Maybe those dudes never get a shot if not for the process years.  That's why it was fun."

"Consider also, the NBA forced better measurements. A lot of players have shrunk in the past couple years. E.g., Bradley Beal is no longer 6'5"". He's 6'3"". Robert covington was 6'9"". Now he's 6'7""."
"Okay so he's been top 3 in WS, WS/48, BPM, PER, VORP, RAPTOR, RPM, and RAPTOR WAR. RAPM is the only statistic that has that opinion and frankly is not a very good statistic for comparing players. According to RAPM the best player in the league in 2018-2019 was Danny Green. In 2017-2018 it was Robert Covington. In 2013-2014 the best player in the league was Andre Iguodala. My favorite though has to be in 2009-2010 when Anderson Varejao was the 2nd best player in the league according to RAPM. Clearly RAPM is either not made for comparing players or is completely useless because I don't think anyone is going to agree with any of these players rankings."

"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
DFS and Jalen Brunson on the mavs. Lu Dort. Robert Covington before his extension.
"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
"He is 4th in total deflections (193), tied with Ben Simmons and behind Fred VanVleet (194), TJ McConnell (217) and Robert Covington (229). Per game, he is 10th with 3.1 per game, behind OG Anunoby (3.2), Smart (3.3), Jrue Holiday (3.3), Larry Nance Jr (3.4), Butler (3.5), TJ McConnell (3.6), Covington (3.6), Ben Simmons (3.6) and Fred VanVleet (3.9)."
"We'll see a few starters come out from this thunder team.  They had Jerami grant, Robert covington, t.j McConnell, nerlens noel who all improved afterwards.  Lakers had the same issue where the players improved afterwards like lonzo, Ingram, randle, and Clarkson. And Larry nance jr. Is injured.  They all played not good enough(for LeBron) because of both Walton and because they were so young."
"A 3&amp;D player IMO is a player who plays above average defense or is considered an above average defender (ideally someone who can guard the opposing team's 1st or 2nd best player), isn't really creating a lot of shots for themselves or others with the ball in their hands, and their primary role on offense is limited to taking and making threes. So guys like Danny Green, Robert Covington, Pat Beverley, Dorian Finney-Smith, Mikal Bridges, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and OG Annuoby would be what I'd consider 3&amp;D players.  Some of the guys you listed are good three point shooters and defenders, but they create too much offense for themselves and/or others to be strictly seen as 3&amp;D players."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
"Robert Covington on Wiggin's contract would be clowned on too.   Look at Tobias Harris, so many people clowned him last season for his performance relative to his contract. Ppl are quiet this yr because he's producing."
"There are a lot of people who still think he’s the guy he was in Minnesota.  But maybe not overt hate (by most), but if you changed his name to “Robert Covington” or some other defensive player and he was having this kind of season people would be considering it a breakout season."
Portland really has no assets to go for a big splash. They gave up two firsts for Robert Covington. CJ doesn't have too much trade value. What can they really do?
"You also get Bob Lanier, McAdoo, Dandridge, and Cousy. If we count Robert (you already said Timelord who doesn't go by Bob) then there's also Robert Parish, Horry, and Covington. Sounds like a squad to me! Definitely not as good as the Kevins but very deep."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

"I really like what Presti has done in OKC, and I highly approve of his current rebuilding plan (granted, I'm a Hinkie-stan for life).          By maximizing your potential of landing a franchise-changing player, you can also give your young prospects lots of PT to develop and you will discover hidden gems in the Process. For example, the Sixers under Hinkie found Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, and Richaun Holmes, among others, and gave all of them a chance to showcase flashes of talent that eventually blossomed into consistent talent and earned them solid-to-great contracts around the league."
Are you implying Houston wasted Harden? Cause they litterally got him every star he asked for and always found quality players on Minimum contracts also there 3rd best player was Robert Covington and not Tucker
In what Universe is PJ tucker better than Robert Covington
"Excellent help defender, but he'd be a target in pnr for elite ball handlers, kinda like an even more extreme version of Robert Covington"
"Exactly. If you are tanking you might as well start random young g-league/undrafted talent and see what happens. Sometimes they are complete trash and sometimes you find gems like Robert Covington, Lu Dort, Moses Brown, Christian Wood etc."
Robert Covington. TJ McConnell. Nerlens Noel. Dario Saric. Jarami Grant. Michael Carter Williams. Christian Wood.
Where this in the playoffs? Hardens 2nd best player was Robert Covington
"He finished 9th and won a total of 7 points. In that sense Robert Covington, Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown were in the conversation for DPOTY because they all finished with a similar amount of points. His own teammate finished 3 spots higher than him."
My bad for the late response but I think if you guys landed Robert Covington and move him back to the wing instead of running him at the PF like the Rockets do. He’d most likely go back to his 76ers days of efficiency. Idk I’m just taking shots in the dark. I love your team and want to see you guys succeed
"The fate of twitter user LordTreeSap’s house on the line, I want ROBERT COVINGTON"
Robert Covington gives his teams an aneurysm anytime he puts the ball on the floor. He shoots 64% of his shots from 3. He's definitely a 3&amp;D.
"Eh. By your definition would a player with an all-around good skillset that isn't an all-star not be a role player? For example Robert Covington. He's a role player, but somehow doesn't fit your definition of a role player."
Robert Covington was a role playing starter. And he was first team all defense.
"A better defensive Robert Covington is probably not an all star, but to call that a role player with starter minutes is just as wrong.  That being said, theres a big gap between learning to shoot, and being a high volume 3pt guy like Cov."
I haven't watched him play but his statistical profile (aka I own him in fantasy LOL) breaks down exactly like Robert Covington. I think that's a great type of niche role he can find himself in for his career.
Jimmy butler was traded for Robert Covington and Dario saric.
He was pretty good in his prime. When Rose got hurt he was the primary scorer and did an admirable job at that. He was an average/above average 3pt shooter. Great defense and would take on the opponents best player. I’d say he was a Robert Covington with much better offense.
Harden 2nd best player was Robert Covington that series
"It's not improved though. They're worse on 3s and offensive efficiency than they ever were.   Season| 3PM| Offensive Rating ---|---|---- 20-21| 26th| 14th 19-20| 19th| 13th 18-19 |19th | 8th 17-18| 12th| 12th  People forget the 76ers have actually had pretty good shooters over the years.  Seth Curry and Danny Green aren't a new development. The 76ers had JJ Redick and Robert Covington, who were better versions of Seth and Danny.  What's changed for them this year is their defence, but their offence and spacing is worse than it's ever been."

norman powell and robert covington appreciation comment
Robert Covington and Norman Powell.. two corporate names
"It’s the opposite, Jokic’s average defense is worth way more because it’s harder to field an average defensive center, there just aren’t many who can do it. That’s why players like Bismack Biyombo are even in the league- teams are willing to have black holes on offense if it prevents them from getting absolutely torched (being unplayable) by big men and at the rim. Jokic has proven he’s a playable defensive 5 even in the playoffs. Jokic is a bad rim protector compared to *starting NBA centers*, but he’s as good or better than “elite” defensive PFs as a rim protector, like Anthony Davis and Robert Covington. His rim protection numbers have been better than Anthony Davis’s for the past few years:  https://imgur.com/a/6HZBV7y   That’s the best illustration I can think of for how much lower replacement value is for centers than other positions on defense (so average D is worth more)."
"Yea i guess what i meant is that when the offense runs through curry there tends to be a lot more passing, movement and screen setting. They try to see if the rockets are going to make a mistake first then and most importantly they keep help defenders occupied while Curry quickly attacks a mismatch. Those kinds of possessions were where the warriors scored a lot more efficiently and generated easier shots.    With KD you get a lot of dribbling in one spot with the whole defense keyed in. Or you get him slowing down movement or the flow of the offense. When i say baited i mean that those posessions were you have a lot of standing around with one guy slowly attacking a perceived mismatch is the exactly the kind of thing Houston wants because that where their defense excels. With steph he was quickly penetrating the defense for either scores or passes that generated high efficiency offense. With KD its him rising up over pretty good defenders, while he can make those shots its just harder to get things going because the rockets defense is confident that he cant make the right reads.  2017 rockets werent drastically different to me, Id argue a guy like Robert Covington is just as valuable as ariza. The biggest difference is the difference between russ and cp3 but for the most part the defensive personnel were very similar. Not saying its a 1:1 comparison but there is enough similarity to come to a conclusion. Im just saying theres no way lebron lets them get away with what they did to Durant."
"PG: Harden (25)  SG: Ingles (12)  SF: Kawhi (26)  PF: Robert Covington (9)  C: Draymond (7)  Total: 76  Great defense, shooting, and passing."
"Why would any team want this lol.  Besides, it is entirely possible to renegotiate deals, it is just super uncommon.  [Covington &amp; the 76'ers did it to give a 15MM pay bump on Covington's last year and locked him in for 4 more years](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2743561-robert-covington-76ers-reportedly-finalizing-4-year-62m-contract-extension)"
Well all those players have different skill sets. Great defender doesent = great on ball defender  Their are multiple parts of defense. Defense isn’t just one thing. Draymond is a great help defender. That’s what makes him a great defender. He’s good on ball but that’s not why he’s great. Same for Giannis (athlouhj Draymond is better on ball than Giannis. Robert Covington is a genuinely poor on ball defender. He’s great in hell defense though.
And steals is not a good metric of defensive skills  Iverson never made an all defensive team. I don’t know why Iverson was brought up at all  Robert Covington is an elite help defender but not great at on ball defense
I have so many questions about this list. Why was *Robert Covington* allowed to shoot so many times in one half?
Robert Covington has entered the chat
"You'd like all your players to be the best versions they  can be. Some guys, like a Grayson Allen or JJ Reddick top out at quality role players. Trevor Arizas, or Robert Covington types.   The thing that is frustrating with Ben Simmons is he has all the intangibles to be LeBron 2.0. He's 6'10""/11"", can guard 1-5 at DPOY level, has a great handle and passing vision seen only in top tier point guards, his size is an instant mismatch and if he put in the work and matched it with the mentality, he'd be a Mount Rushmore player.   It's not giving heat or being salty, it's almost bitter disappointment that we're witnessing one of the greats not be...great"

Robert Covington?
By that logic Robert Covington got snubbed
Thing is the blazers with Nurkic were roughly 15th defense in multiple years. Problem is Nurk gets hurt and Stotts had Enes Kanter to protect the rim along with Robert Covington and fuck all to guard the perimeter.
Those Rockets teams were pretty flawed though. Dude had Robert Covington playing center and no actual bigs. And no mid range. That takes CJ McCollum out.
2 years ago this dude was told he wasn't helping the team win while putting up 60 and 70 point games. People legitimately argued that Robert Covington was a better player. Booker deserves to talk all the shit he wants.
Alex Caruso and Robert Covington.
Robert Covington
He is their Robert Covington; the low usage 3&amp;D guy
"Robert Covington, richaun holmes"
"[Wojnarowski] Portland has agreed to trade star guard Damian Lillard to the Trailblazers for CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Jusuf Nurkic, and 3 first round picks."
"They absolutely need to trade for a top five player to be in contention with Dame. You act like they would just be adding that player and losing nothing.  Also, Allen and Levert are not Late First quality assets, they outperformed that.   You also seem to forget the Blazers gave up two first for Robert freaking Covington. They don’t have the draft capital that Brooklyn did."
People like the idea of boxing more than the actual thing.  The Jeff Green / Robert Covington effect
1. Joel Embiid  2. Ben Simmons  3. Robert Covington  4. Dario Saric  5. TJ McConnell
"Look, Jokic got killed tonight in the PnR. There is a difference between that statement, and he is INCAPABLE of being a positive defender.  Regarding getting targeted: matchups make fights. Guys like Robert Covington and Pat Bev get targeted in some matchups, are they automatically bad defenders?"
"The NBA community likes analytics, narratives, and fun basketball. Rudy Gobert is the perfect representation of everything modern NBA fans don't want to see in basketball. He doesn't shoot 3's, doesn't defend multiple positions, slow, back to the basket, not flashy, analytics and modern basketball theory prove that Rudy Gobert sucks...But then he plays good and wins basketball games. Their Is a reason why players like Robert Covington, P.J Tucker, and Zion are beloved. They represent the type of basketball fans want to see. Gobert isn't that."
Putting PJ Tucker and Robert Covington on the floor together was the most genius thing Morey ever did save trading for Harden. Perfectly complimented each other's weaknesses AND Russ's weaknesses.
"Robert ""Coach Slayer"" Covington"
"The r/RipCity thread when we landed him was like “YO GET IN HERE BOYS WE’RE MAKING A RUN THIS TIME.”  It’s like, no, we traded for Robert Covington. Lmao"
Robert Covington is an absolute enigma
Or just specifically Robert Covington
Robert Covington is the human victory cigar of firing people
"He's the ultimate ""missing piece"". When a team wants to try and prove to their supporters that they at least kinda care, they get Robert Covington."
"""Luke, come in and have a seat.""  ""What up Vivek? I heard you guys were making some roster moves.""  ""We are. I don't know how to say this, but we really appreciate your time here. We just traded for Robert Covington which means...""  ""Fuck. Yeah, I know what it means. Why couldn't you just fire me over text or something? You had to go and get Robert Covington to really prove your point?"""
Reminds me of how everybody wanted Robert Covington as if he actually changed the team's defense.
Robert Covington? Gotta be some sort of really good 3 and D player.
"It’s both hit and miss with fantasy.  Fantasy players run into the same biases that other fans do with initial skepticism over a guy because of preconceived notions. However, they also tend to break those biases much more quickly because they are being continuously confronted with empirical evidence to the contrary - and if a guy is in waivers then it’s a race to grab them, so maintaining the skeptical wait and see approach is usually not in your best interests (without getting into a rabbit hole of fantasy roster management).  That said, guys who perform very well in fantasy also tend to get overhyped, especially if they are guys who excel in their role.   Robert Covington, for example, is one of the most memed fantasy basketball players ever primarily because he was ballin out with those process sixers teams and a lot of people got him off of waivers. And for the following few years he was reasonably consistent at giving you stocks and threes. People call him “lord Covington” around there.  I don’t know how much of his reputation as an elite 3&amp;D guy in the basketball community comes from that, but it’s probably a nonzero amount. The problem is he’s a better off ball defender than on ball defender, and his game doesn’t really scale up. So he’s a fine role player, but probably not worth the picks he’s been traded for over the past few years (arguably - there’s something to be said about finding a good role player to fill the holes in your roster).  A guy like Jokic was probably still thought of as a meme by most of the fantasy community like everyone else as an overweight euro guy. But his game actually *did* have room to scale up - as anyone who listened to/read EG’s posts back then would know. A common refrain against Jokic is “yeah his per36 numbers look good but let’s see him do it full time. He’s too fat to play more than 20 minutes a night. Those fancy passes and post moves won’t work against starters; he’s just feasting on bench units.”   One of the local Denver guys once compared Jokic to a goldfish. He said he would grow to the size of his bowl. He has consistently risen to every challenge so far."
"Yeah, I'd say this is just Sixers Robert Covington"
It was a process era thing. Not much else to root for. Robert Covington used to be the biggest Frosty guy. He'd hype up the crowd.
"Why tf did Portland give up 2 first round picks for Robert Covington lmfao.   And the Harden trade was not as bad as people make it out to be. It's pretty much impossible to get equal value for a top 10 player, but the offer that they took was the best one available."
"&gt;If that's all it took to pry away Jerami Grant, plenty of teams would pony up two 1sts.  Not true, Grant wasnt for sale before the deadline.  &gt;Portland gave up two 1sts for Robert Covington. Grant is way better.  The Blazers overpaid. Jerami was considered around the same the year before and he went for 1 playoff 1st."
"Fuck Yeah.  If that's all it took to pry away Jerami Grant, plenty of teams would pony up two 1sts.    Portland gave up two 1sts for Robert Covington.  Grant is way better."
Dirk and Duncan's organizations actually surrounded them with good players   Dame wants to win here but the best trade we've made to get him help in 5 years is Robert Covington lmao
Robert Covington is not good enough to the point where you do trades to accommodate him.   Also you can never have too many versatile 3nD players.
Robert Covington on steroids.
"Such a dumb question to begin with. This team would go for a 48-0 3-peat and win every game by 30 points:  Donovan Mitchell  CJ McConnel  Paul George  Bam Adebayo  Karl Anthony Towns  Bench: Dragic, Robert Covington, Nurkic  So I guess Paul George (or whoever you pick) is capable of being the best player on the greatest dynasty ever"
i think robert covington also gets overrated for the same reasons josh richardson got overrated for a stretch
This is tough.   Jokic can dominate anyone. But we also watched him against Portland vs Robert Covington and co.  I think I have to go with kawhi right now. That man can literally get a bucket at will and he doesn’t really make mistakes
"Honestly it was a “get what you can” situation since he was walking either way. And we got Curry out of it, I guess. It’s more that we bought into the idea that JRich was this Robert Covington approximation when he clearly is not"
we’ll give you slightly gently used CJ Mccollum and Robert Covington for Benny.
"Dude, the biggest win now move we've made in 5 years for Dame was trading for Robert Covington lol  That can't be your biggest ever move to get Dame talent when he's had zero all stars on his team in that span"
If u go super small Robert Covington and PJ Tucker
"I mean a team's struggles ultimately fall on all three of players, coaching, and management. It's the player's job to execute a scheme to win games, it's a coach's job to design and adjust a scheme so the players can execute, and it's management's responsibility to supply players who can execute as well as a coach who can get his players to execute.  In Stott's case - he had two clear objectives given by management: to win a playoff series and improve the defense. Management supplied the team with guys they thought Stotts needed to improve the defense, and therefore win a series, with players like Derrick Jones Jr and Robert Covington.  In Stott's case - the management did seemingly give him players that would improve the team.    Add Gary Trent Jr's comments this season about being asked to do way more within the Raptors' defense - and it's hard to say Stotts got too much blame. Maybe he wasn't actually given enough talent to work with - but management has every reason to believe he was and that he failed at his job."
"Captain obvious choice for the front office. Dont get me wrong, a good chunk of the Blazers problem IS the front office and their bad decisions, I don't know how many teams have a worse rotation at the 4/5 spot than the Blazers do, Robert Covington shouldn't be defending Jokic the whole final 5-6 minutes, but ultimately Stotts has a first ballot hall of famer and he wasted his prime"

"god can't save you austin, but cj mcollum robert covington norman powell can"
"I just checked and how the fuck has CJ not been an all star ever. That's crazy to me. West must be that stacked.  Anyways, it doesn't matter. CJ is still a good player that is still a threat that the defense has to focus on. It's not even debatable which sidekicks were worse. Imagine comparing someone like Kyle Macy and Dave Corzine to Robert Covington and Norman Powell. And I'm not making those first two names up. Those were two of MJ's starting teammates in the 63 point game. Macy was out of the league after the next year."
How about sending a double team? The guy is in the midst of an all-time performance and you're worried about leaving Robert Covington open?
Fucking Robert Covington man. Throwing the game away
I can never forgive Robert Covington for trying those two missed dunks. Why is he cocking it back ffs
I can never forgive Robert Covington for trying those two missed dunks. Why is he cocking it back ffs
I can never forgive Robert Covington for trying those two missed dunks. Why is he cocking it back ffs
Robert Covington sucks now
How can Jokic be MVP when Robert Covington is the best player on the Nuggets?
"If you're in that locker room wearing a Portland Trailblazers jersey tonight and your name is not Damian Lillard, how can you live with yourself? We needed only one of them to be fucking replacement level to pull this one off with the way Damian was playing, and what did we get? Robert Covington missing wide open dunks and CJ McCollum walking on the sideline with the ball.  I feel sick to my stomach."
Good night to everybody. Except Robert Covington
Robert Covington missing 2 dunks when he could’ve just did a layup
Lol kill robert Covington wtf
he'd have 50 points on mostly insane turnaround 3s over royce oneale..er uh robert covington
be the robert covington you want to see in the world
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"&gt;  you guys couldnt even win one game against GS and KD wasnt even playing.  ...the series before we beat Denver starting Enes Kanter.  Then people are somehow shocked we don't do better playing Dame, CJ, and Enes Kanter vs Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green while Dame is playing with a separated rib.    Our center rotation that series was Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard.  We went from starting Aminu, Mo Harkless, and Enes Kanter to Norman Powell, Robert Covington, and Jusuf Nurkic."
Surprised Robert Covington hasn't come up
"Sounds a lot like Robert Covington, except Covington is actually playable"

"&gt;In the real world it's hard to point to ways that they definitively should have done this or that and then actually be able to prove that they could have done that thing if they wanted to.  This is kind of the problem people look for definitive proof of ""Well they couldve done this specific thing"" and if its not 100% concrete then they use the idea of plausible deniability of ""Well we dont know for sure if that couldve happened"". Which before long people run with and turn it into ""there is nothing else they couldve really done in this spot"" because that's convenient.   Reality is over the span of 5 yrs their track record speaks for itself. Gave out awful free agent contracts in 2016 that crippled them. Have been content running back largely the same core for 4-5 yrs. Never been viably involved in trade talks for any really good player(not even a Kawhi but a Jrue Holiday type). Their big ""all in move"" was trading for Robert Covington. Have never shown any interest in actually seriously trying to pursue a title in Dame's prime. Which guess what that involves risks, but not even trying and being content running back dead end 47 win teams isnt it at all.   You can nitpick any specific move and say ""Oh well circumstances were this and this"" and ""that's why it wasnt that bad"" etc. Over the course of 5 yrs however the evidence is what it is and doing this is just not living in line with reality."
"Sorry Portland, but if you task 6'7"" 200 lb. Robert Covington and legendary olé defender Carmelo Anthony to grab a rebound over one of the best rebounders in the league in a must-have situation, then you deserve to lose."
LMFAOO terry stotts had Robert Covington boxing out Jokic for the game winning rebound 😭😭😭
"This game really was the ultimate 2021 Portland Trailblazers experience.     \- Damian Lillard splitting the defense to hit wide open wings who proceed to throw up bricks     \- Jusuf Nurkic, knowing his team's only chance of staying in the game is with him on the floor, removing himself from the game by committing a pointless boneheaded foul with five minutes left      \- Terry Stotts deciding the best way to handle Jokic over the final five minutes is by bodying him up with Carmelo Anthony and Robert Covington (!)     \- CJ repeatedly sagging off of Austin Rivers as he drills open three after open three"
"I think there's only really a small table of elite 3&amp;D swingmen in the league, and Jae is certainly one of them:   * Jae Crowder  * Robert Covington  * Mikal Bridges  * Marcus Morris  * Danny Green  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  * OG Anunoby * Dorian Finney-Smith * PJ Tucker"
"Also Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Landry Shaker, possibly? Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Iguodala, Lou Will"
Robert Covington with a terrific 3/1/1 on 38 minutes played in a playoff game.   This franchise owes Damian Lillard a public apology.
Robert Covington
Robert Covington was really good at this when he was a Sixer.
"Jimmy got traded for Robert Covington, Dario saric, Justin Patton, Jared bayless, and a second. Kawhi got traded for an all nba player (derozan), a young center with potential (poetl) and a pick that became keldon Johnson. Safe to say that jimmy was easier to trade for."
"The Pocket Rockets were custom made to be abused by AD in the paint and he still didn't take advantage of it.  He settled for a lot of mid range shots and was a turnover machine.  He had 3 good games and 2 below average games against a team whose ""bigs"" were PJ Tucker and Robert Covington."
"“If a young unproven playoff player shot 50% from 3 on Robert Covington we would have won”  MPJs shot selection from 3 was wild, on top of that he won’t go 11/11 from 2 again."
"I think of wings as forwards, especially the SF position. Although they are fairly solid with the PF position right now, with Robert Covington and Carmelo Anthony, the SF position is pretty much vacant in the 8-man rotation they are running-- they have kept a three-guard line-up (Powell, Lillard, McCollum) with McCollum taking the point when Lillard sits and bringing in Simons, yet another guard."
"Well it's also different because he had Russ, Eric Gordon, Robert Covington, and PJ Tucker instead of relying on Jordan Poole, JLT, and Dray lol"
"The Sixers were an embarrassment and ruined basketball by unearthing players like Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Christian Wood and Richaun Holmes."
"Were the Sixers tanking when they drafted Joel Embiid instead of a healthy player who could contribute like Dante Exum? Were they tanking when they traded away future superstar Michael Carter Williams for a first round pick? Were they tanking when they took a future first and Dario Saric who wouldn't come over for two years in exchange for Elfrid Payton? And were they tanking when they gave minutes to g leaguers like Robert Covington or second round picks like Jerami Grant?  Or is it possible young players just need time to develop or get healthy? Is it possible Michael Carter Williams or Evan Turner weren't going to result in the Sixers winning more games? And is it possible after the Sixers traded away essentially everything valuable they had for a player who would never play a single game for them, it was not feasible to put together a competitive team immediately?   Who's to say? I don't know but I don't think it's you. You're not the Sixers expert you pretend to be  Edit: Also what is this?  &gt;Just going through the replies you will see many readers were misinformed by the false narrative you pushed  Did a child write this?"
"Bro we were literally able to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris from moves he made two years prior. He literally said he shuddered at the lost opportunity of signing Robert Covington as an UDFA when Houston picked him up. He didn't just suck and guess, he was building something that stood the test of time (BC and EB). Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Richard Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few pieces that would be really beneficial to contenders not as stars but as high-mid level bench pieces"
"I don’t really know how Thybulle’s career will progress, and to be honest I think he will never be an overly positive floor spacer. I think his shooting ceiling is around Robert Covington.  However Thybulle’s defensive ability is definitely a lot rarer of a skill than being a league average shooter. That’s why I mention that “if” Thybulle can become a league average shooter, he will be an amazing player."
"Can’t remember exactly, I think 2K 13 or 14, but I won numerous MVPs with Robert Covington lol. Draining 3’s like he was Curry."
Well I also included Robert Covington who is a perfect fit there  But because they'd suddenly be a title favorite
"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
"I still think there are some adjustments here, but I dont think it's a *terrible* framework.  I've thought of something similar if Portland was going to blow it up and Sixers were going to move Simmons for him:  Philadelphia receives: Dame + TJ Warren + Buddy Hield  Indiana receives: Ben Simmons + Robert Covington  Sacramento receives: Tobias Harris + Domantas Sabonis  Portland receives: Marvin Bagley + Tyrese Maxey + Aaron Holiday + 2021 Sacramento 1st (pick 9) + 2021 Sixers (pick 28) + 2023 Sixers pick + 2027 Sixers pick"
"Robert Covington got 2 FRPs.....there's so much nuance to just saying first round picks. But yeah, two Hornets FRPs are likely much more valuable than others, no offense."
Robert Covington.
"trades are still a thing. for example, if the cost to get Jimmy Butler in 2018 was only Robert Covington and Dario Saric i don’t see how they couldnt have competed with that offer"
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
You mean *checks notes* Robert Covington wasn’t enough last year
"You forgot the classic, Robert ""Blow the team up cause for some reason having one defender isnt enough"" Covington"
"There were numerous years where the defense was around 16th, which was part of the goal. Have an elite offense and an average to above average defense.   All Stotts ever needed with Dame was a defensive center and some 3 and D wings. He never really got that outside of Nurkic. He got Anthony Tolliver, Mario Hezonja, Enes Kanter Derrick Jones Jr who shoots 25% from 3 and Melo. Robert Covington was the only one and he's a bit overrated on defense.   Stotts failure was Olsheys to begin with."
"What about when Butler was done in Minnesota? He was traded to the Sixers for Jerryd Bayless, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and a second round pick. Portland definitely could have made a better offer than that"
"In 2017, George was traded for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, at a time when Dipo was seen as as disappointing and Sabonis as solid but nothing special. In 2018, Jimmy was traded for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round draft pick."
"I think the difference is Utah have put a far better team around Mitchell than Portland ever have around Dame. Dame hasn't played with an active all star since his first couple of years in the league when LMA was still around. The biggest moves we've made in the last four years was to bring in Robert Covington and Melo. Coupled with what can only be described as terrible draft picks, the front office should be ashamed that it got to this.  Dame was as loyal as anyone could have expected him to be, and the FO accepting mediocrity has pushed him away."
Especially when your team has made zero moves to help you out  The biggest trade we've made in the last 4 years was getting Robert Covington lmao.   You can't win as the only all star. Even winning a single round as one is tough
He’s not a net positive on that contract. He’s Robert Covington making the max
May I introduce you to my man Robert Covington. Starts hitting logo threes on the regular towards the end of the season but can't hit a layup to save his life. I call him a budget Holiday.
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
&gt; Draft picks are the only thing tossed around more than ~~Trevor Ariza and Robert Covington~~   your mom*
"Noel and Embiid were both injury concerns, which explains the Okafor pick decently well. There were also reports that Hinkie was ready to sell high on Okafor the spring of or summer after his rookie season, a la MCW, but he was fired too quickly.  As far as talent evaluation goes, people always seem to forget he was responsible for taking chances on several players who have been contributors to playoff teams. TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerami Grant, and Christian Wood to name a few.  I think he would've shined the most retooling a championship contender, in the ilk of his old mentor, Morey. His real strengths were less in the lottery and more in the late second round, acquisition of G Leaguers/undrafted players, and trades. All things the Sixers could use now."
"Dame was winning games this year with Enes Kanter and Robert Covington as his best teammates. AD couldn’t do that, plus he gets injured way more than Dame and isn’t the leader Dame is."
"Giving up Simmons for a return of Buddy Heild, Robert Covington and another role player make the Sixers the 4th seed."
Draft picks are the only thing tossed around more than Trevor Ariza and Robert Covington
They needed to build a better roster.   Get the best complimentary players (eg Robert Covington comes to mind) vs all stars to impersonate those guys. And definitely bring in size like a Brook Lopez and Andre Drummond to play big. Having Bam and KD as your biggest on the roster won’t work well.  Any thoughts on better roster construction?
And I would trade Robert Covington for Kevin Durant
Mikal Bridges and Robert Covington are not a 40 point swing in a game against Australia.
"players who get wishfully compared a lot to Draymond Green because they are pretty skilled, they look like they are too small to play center a lot but center is still probably/aspirationally their best position, and if you squint hard they seem like maybe they could be multi-position defenders  Tier 1 - Draymond Green, ΟG Anunoby, Ben Simmons  Tier 2 - Onyeka Okongwu, Daniel Theis, Aaron Gordon, Zion Williamson, Robert Covington, PJ Tucker  Tier 3 - Grant Williams, DJ Wilson, JaMychal Green"
"Role specialization in basketball has caused stars to focus on only one side of the ball. If you add some 3D guys like robert covington and mikal bridges, I can guarantee USA is going to start winning by 30 again"
We need Robert Covington.
Westbrook Harden and Eric Gordon isn't the greatest defensive lineup. It gets worse when you realize the big on the floor was Robert Covington.
"They ran small ball 3 guard lineups frequently last season with Harden, Westbrook and Eric Gordon. Austin Rivers also played with Harden and Westbrook. They had Robert Covington as the big in that lineup.  They occasionally ran CP3, Harden and Eric Gordon, however, they didn't do that too often because they had Ariza at the 3."
"""Let me tell you a little story about the 2020 season. I was doing this deal with Houston for Robert Covington, never once touched the salary cap. I'd go to the trade machine, get some Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones Jr, Cup-A-Rodney Hood... baby, I got a stew going."""
"The idea that value ""basically zeroes"" if the person is on the losing team is incredibly flimsy.   In no world does it make sense for dame's value to be rendered null because Robert Covington can't dunk and cj can't pass. In no world does it make sense that facundo campazzo and his 1/5 with 3pts had a more valuable game and contributed more positive influence in that game than dame.  Dame, the singular player, had more value in that game than every single other player who played a second in that game.  Denver, the collective team, exploited the blazers poor defense and inability to get consistent offense outside of dame.  It was obvious to anyone watching that dame was the best player on the court. It was obvious to anyone watching who had the most positive influence in the game.   Roco converting one of his two missed dunks does not change that fact. His teammates going 1/14 in OT does not change that fact"
"Just because 20 point leads are blown more often, doesn’t mean it’s an acceptable outcome, *especially* in the playoffs.   And those are just examples. Other “lesser” guys who the fanbase always really appreciated because of their hard work and hustle would be guys like TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Dario Saric. Any time those guys come back to Philly, they still get standing ovations."
"Eh, not if hes shooting like that. Thats PJ Tucker or Robert Covington money"
"For instance, Miles Turner, who's been shopped all over the league @ 17 Mil.  Bobby Portis who's only getting paid like 3.6 Mil or Jerami Grant who's only on a 3 yr 60 Mil deal. or Robert Covington ,etc etc etc."
Robert Covington w the Vipers  Note: I use DuckDuckGo tho so my search results get kinda weird sometimes lol David Robinson does pop up in third tho after a pic of Duncan Robinson.
Is this still working? I would love to have robert covington in my flair.
"Off-ball, he can play a slashing game that's common on forwards and can be a 3 and D guy low-key like a Robert Covington. It's LeBron though and him playing that way is more of a way to conserve energy/effort than to play the more controlling/taxing on-ball PG style."
Robert Covington III and Quinndary Weatherspoon sound like English tea traders for the East India Company
"The sliders don’t make the game less shit, I shouldn’t have to force a basketball simulation  game to do simplistic things like make Robert Covington a functional basketball player or make it so that a bunch of starter and quality level players go unsigned and stay there because 2k doesn’t understand the salary cap."
"Michael Beasley is still a better pure scorer than perhaps 40% of NBA players on current rosters. The only issue is he’s not a system player (can’t really be a 3rd/4th option on the court), doesn’t play much defense, and is old. But if you need a bucket for one possession, he’s better than a lot of players. For example, he would already be better pure scorer than Robert Covington or DJJ on the Blazers, except the first two offer a ton of other things like defense."
"I wouldn't call Giddey a 3&amp;d prospect yet - obviously he's got the size for it but by all accounts he'll be a bit of a project. Moody is that 3&amp;D guy but by all accounts his ceiling is probably a Robert Covington type.   It's a classic case of ""do you build for the future beyond the current dynasty"" versus ""do you tool around the current dynasty for one last run"""
"The franchise mode might be one of the worst parts of the game. It’s one of if not the only mode they don’t make money from so it’s been the same exact thing for like 3 years now. Contracts become inflated after like 2 seasons so it’s literally impossible to sign players, everyone just magically becomes a star, trades are even worse than proposals you’ll see on Reddit, there’s no realism at all, some players are just completely horrible because they purposefully turn down their stats (an example of this is Robert Covington literally being like the worst player in the league) there’s so many other things I could say but I’d be ranting for hours."
Why is Robert Covington the backup center and Nurkic is the starting forward?    Also is the salary cap turned off here?
"&gt;A mask doesn’t affect shooting?  My guy, if Robert fucking Covington didn’t let a mask affect him, I expect the same from Booker"
"The market was what it was. Even Robert Covington yielded 2 firsts for the Rockets, Vucevic yielded some young players and 2 firsts..   For the Bucks it was crucial for them to go all in to show Giannis their commitment to win now in this bitch.. it would have been a much better outcome too given they had the chance to do Sign and trade with Kings for Bogdanovic, but some bullshit leak fucked it up"
Hunter is great. He’s like Robert Covington but an efficient 16ppg.
"I don’t think so, at least not from the fan perspective.  For me personally, and for a lot of other die-hard Sixer fans, the Process years were great.  I enjoyed those teams so much more than the years of consistently finishing 7th-10th in the East and knowing we were never going to contend to win a championship, and never going to draft high enough to draft a truly impact player.  At least with the Process year, I had zero expectations and I wasn’t getting my heart broken by being let down over unrealistic expectations.  It was also great watching lightly heralded players such as Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, etc turn into quality NBA players."
"Espn is the new mtv,many have stopped watching  it because the channel  dropped the real reason people originally   watched it. Maybe that reason wasn't profitable so I get it.  On Jalen Rose, Kevin Love  is a guy who I said retired years ago but didnt tell anyone.   I don't know if he made the team because he is white but I do know other guys like Brook Lopez , John Collins even a Robert Covington deserved the slot more and bring more to the table. Because with that roster what he brings is redundant, he only brings they say experience. Outside shooting debatable.  And for Jalen, Ayton played on the Bahamas team so I don't know if he can play for team USA.  If you can't prove what you say might as well keep it to yourself."
"they clearly did develop talent? see Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood(kind of), Ish Smith, Jerami Grant, Saric, Embiid, TJ McConnell  &amp; i remember point guards Isaiah Canaan, Ish Smith, TJ McConnell, MCW and Tony Wroten.   i understand you don’t like the process but what you just said clearly wasn’t true. Okafor has proven to be a bust on multiple teams, Noel never developed to his potential on multiple teams either. don’t act like this is strictly a sixers thing"
Instead of this deal find a way to bring Robert Covington to the Warriors. I like Poole as my back up PG. i like wiseman as my center too. Mulder and smiley need to go
"They weren’t an all time great but they probably would have gone back to back.  That 76ers team was built much better. Had Jimmy Butler, Robert Covington and had the floor spacing provided by the shooting of JJ Reddick.  The 2016 Warriors team almost lost to OKC. But we don’t use that as a knock against them."
Throw in Robert Covington and you can have yourself one half of Ben Simmons
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Robert Covington  Quincy Pondexter  Wilt Chamberlain  Tiago Splitter  Travis Outlaw
Robert Covington
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"Agree or disagree, Kemba is a negative asset that took the #16 to get rid of. You are totally disrespecting the value of Ben Simmons. If you can get CJ McCollum+ for Simmons, why the hell would you take Kemba instead, who is more injured and less skilled.   Rockets basically got the same haul for Robert Covington, and they didn't have to take on an awful max contract, they got an expiring Trevor Ariza"
"&gt; PHI receives: CJ McCollum, Robert Covington POR receives: Ben Simmons, Seth Curry  I pitched this trade like a week and a half ago and Sixers fans destroyed me for suggesting it."
Nah he will most likely be a decent role player. I’m thinking a shorter version of Robert Covington
"Robert Covington, Trevor Ariza, or Danny Green?"
"Stares directly at Marcus Smart, Draymond Green, and Robert Covington"
"How do you guys not see it? Portland can go into the luxury tax for Dames last 3 years. Resign Norman and run out a line up of Dame,Powell,Simmons,Robert and Nurk. That line up will score enough and the defense will be light-years better, especially if Covington and Nurk stay healthy."
"And the bucks should have traded Giannis because he would have gotten more value than Bledsoe /s    This take is so dumb lmao   Ben Simmons doesn’t work. They don’t need a second star they just need a fringe all star and maybe a role player to playmake or play defense. If they can get Robert Covington and McCollum for example that’s more than enough. The sixers are a contender, they just need a different piece that fits their needs, not a compete rebuild"
"&gt;Blazers never had... Ariza  The absolute DISRESPECT for Trailblazers legend Trevor Ariza.   His defensive contributions involved trying hard and then getting traded for Robert Covington, which is more than you can say for most guys we ask to play defense."
"Yes!  The credit I will give him: he *did* do a decent job at identifying some value prospects in the doldrums, like Robert Covington and Jerami Grant, and he signed them to good contracts. His trades were good, but partially because he was doing fire-sales of assets and only wanted picks back. What he did when he held Payton hostage for the Magic was good. But there are other aspects of GMing that he was *bad* at, and his legion of starry-eyed devotees who pay respect at his shrine on the regular seem to overlook all these."
Robert Covington gonna be the starting center now.  Sorry Nurkic and Kanter.
"He has CJ/Norman Powell/ Melo who can all score very well and somewhat initiate the offence if Dame wants to play offball. Nurkic is a good big, just very injury prone. Robert Covington is a good wing defender who can knock down some 3s. Anfernee Simons is a great spark off the bench and is a very good shooter, he is only scratching his potential. Zach Collins was good, no idea what he's like now after the injuries.   All in all, Portland have a good roster. It's just very unbalanced because of their lack of defensive stoppers. They would literally need maybe 2/3 trades and their team, on paper anyway, can be 1-4th seed in the west."
"Dawg, if Robert Covington, Marco Bellinelli, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Reddick, George Hill, and a whole other handful of tweener 3pt chuckers like Mike Scott and Ilyasova can't help this man with his jump shot, Lu Dort ain't doing shit for him lol"
"In 2017-18 when we lost to Boston we blamed Brett Brown and Robert Covington. In 2018-19 when we lost to Toronto we blamed Brett Brown and Tobias Harris. Now its Doc Rivers. No coach can win when you have a black hole offensive liability like Ben Simmons on your team. Saying that, don't care if the organization fires him."
"Please leave my dad, Robert Covington out of this"
Tobias Harris goes up softer than Robert Covington.
"Eh.. bit of a revisionist history there. At the time, they already have a Mikal Bridges, who just had a 1st team All Defensisve season with 37% 3pt shooting in Robert Covington. Their biggest need at the time was a replacement down the line for expiring JJ Redick so they traded for a SG. Admittedly, trading for Zhaire was a bad trade, but no one couldve predicted the freak accident he had, and even if he was healthy, he might not be a great fit. If they had traded for a better shooting prospect like Huerter or DiVincenzo, it wouldnt be as bad of a trade."
If the Blazers include Robert Covington the Sixers would be getting an upgraded version of Thybulle-a strong defender that take open shots
"Props to the clippers for making the open shots and not giving up at halftime, they deserve to win the game. But this comeback is on the Jazz coach Snyder.  Keeping Gobert in the game for so long as the lead slipped away due to open 3 pointers in the corner from Mann or Batum on just about every possesion....  It's a baffling decision and I don't understand why the Jazz didn't match up with a Conley, Mitchell, Clarkson, Bogdonovich, O'neale lineup. If Conley couldn't play that many minutes in his first game back then play Ingles instead.  The clippers didn't play Zubac hardly at all in the 2nd half, so there was no need for Gobert's rebounding and rim protecting. Even if the Jazz guards gave up contested lay ups and 2 pointers, that would be a more difficult comeback for the clippers than giving up wide open corner 3s.  Just about every clipper highlight from the 3rd quarter is Mann or Batum hitting a 3 pointer with Gobert's outstretched arm barely in the frame.  Moving forward, the Jazz need another impact player off the bench who can play the 5 in against other team's small ball line ups. (A Robert Covington or Draymon Green type of player.) Or a big man who can stretch the floor a bit on offense at the very least (A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player, though preferably someone a little younger.)  The Jazz have a good team, they just don't have a flexible line up to match up against other team's playstyles. Compare them too... the Clippers, who have players like Cousins, Zubac, and Rondo. They have Morris, a guy with decent size who can stretch the floor. Reggie Jackson and Luke Kenard who can stretch the floor and give a spark off the bench. All players with a specific skill set that is useful in certain matchups and specific situations."
"The Snyder overreactions are dumb. We have no other players worth putting in, maybe Juwan Morgan wont look worse than Niang, but even then he's not doing shit as a small ball 5.   Jazz need more versatile players like Royce. We have no perimeter defense outside of him. Jrue Holiday, Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, Aaron Gordon, etc all got moved and we couldnt get any of them."
"They are a good team, but this series exposed that they do not have a good small ball line-up, specifically for defense. They more depth off the bench and should make 1 or 2 roster adjustments (but preferably both).  1. A big man off the bench that can rebound on defense and space the floor on offense, while still offering some decent rim protection. A Brook Lopez or Marc Gasol type of player. (Though preferably someone younger if they can.) This player would swap in for Gobert when teams play small, because Gobert has no post game on offense which makes him a liability in these small ball matchups. 2. A wing player who can guard the perimeter and also play the 5 against a small ball lineup. A Draymond Green or Robert Covington type of player. Someone who can close out to the 3 point line, but also hustle and get rebounds."
"I mean Robert Covington and Dario Saric turned into Jimmy Butler turned into Josh Richardson turned into Seth Curry, so maybe Seth Curry was the final stage of the process all along"
Robert Covington and Mikal Bridges
"McCollum is easily an all-star in the east. And games used as a point guard he scores 28+ and is surprisingly efficient. Robert Covington is a positive on every team and Morey loves him. And also, who should the 76er's trade who's better than Simmons?"
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are a couple recent ones:     Robert Covington: [https://basketballbeacon.com/robert-covington-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/robert-covington-player-profile-stats/)     Tim Hardaway Jr.: [https://basketballbeacon.com/tim-hardaway-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/tim-hardaway-player-profile-stats/)     If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page)     Thanks!"
"I'm not sure how to articulate this as well as I should but in my opinion I think people are a little unfair when they dismiss bigs like that.  If you compare to a mid-level 3 and D player like IDK Jae Crowder or Robert Covington or Patrick Beverley or something like that I think the comparison makes more sense.   They can hit open shots and they can have a 20 point game when they're feeling it,  but they're not guys that can put the ball on the floor and create offense reliably on their own.   If you're relying on Jae Crowder to be your 3rd best offensive player you're going to be very sad when he goes 1/5 from 3, but if he's the 5th guy on a well-constructed roster with playmakers it's an awesome skillset.  The valuation is kind of weird because you're obviously expecting your big to influence the defense in a way that perimeter players can't, but I think from that perspective it makes it easier to understand why people would want that.   If you have a good point guard and if Steven Adams is going to be a one-man defense that takes the pressure off and gives you roster flexibility to play guys that aren't a good fit defensively I think that can really have a much bigger impact than just his individual skill would suggest."
"Sure, but we’ve seen players escalate situations to force their way out. Kyrie threatened to have a season-ending procedure if he wasn’t moved. Kawhi was willing to sit out the season if I remember right. James Harden intentionally flouted COVID protocols. Butler threw a tantrum and set up an interview to embarrass the franchise, then loafed it up and down the court for 13 games before tanking his value so severely he got moved for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.   The way things are currently constructed, players have a lot of power to get what they want. There’s no way to fully combat that, but if a dude not even halfway through a rookie contract is trying to force his way out, the league needs reevaluate how they maintain parity and keep the league as a whole running."
"You name 3 and then say who else? Lol Robert Covington,  Okogie is also a good defensive player So is culver for a younger player.  He has had good defensive players around him."
* Tobias Harris  * Malcolm Brogdon  * Nikola Vucevic  * Robert Covington
"1) i purposely left out klay because this post doesn't include all-star players. I can respect Robert Covington, OG anunoby, Mikal Bridges pick. But i believe with the 3&amp;D status, he is up there.  2) I mentioned in the next few years, he could be an all-defensive player. Pels terrible defensive rating is because as a whole, the team doesn't have good defensive players; Zion and BI are not good defensively.   3) i'm not sure about this. I'm not qualified to evaluate half court offense.  4) i believe he can be an all-star, not necessarily next season or the season after that. The point being, he is only 23 and has a lot of room for improvement. His reworked shot mechanics has proven that he has a great work ethic and works hard to develop his game. So it is not unplausible that he can become an all-star caliber player"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
I think Steph/Klay/Dray is too good and too experienced to lose a 7 game series without something going significantly wrong. If Klay is noticeably a shell of himself I see it a little more but if he's 85% of himself like a Robert Covington type with his shot still being what it is I can see a very stubborn (conference or)  finals run
"Joe Harris, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, and DeAndre hunter too"
"I guess it depends on who the 3rd team is in that hypothetical. Everybody seems to forget that trading Ben will result in them having a wing-sized hole in their roster that they don't have the personnel to replace him with. Are they really going to run Danny Green or Korkmaz at the 3?  If they're able to swing a Dame trade, I sincerely think that the 76ers would consider throwing a pick back at Portland to take on Robert Covington (he'd be traded anyways if Portland is blowing up the damn team).  McDaniels could fit that whole, but I doubt that Philly would want to trust a second-year guy that was barely a first round draft pick with starters minutes on push to contention."
"covington averaged 9.3/7.8/1.2 on .500/.500/.900 in the playoffs which was a slight uptick in points and rebounds and significant uptick in shooting percentages lmao no stinker there, dude literally performed about as well as you want from a player who's there for his defense and spacing.  everyone is letting his two missed dunks in the double OT game weigh too heavily; he was the second best blazer in that game with 19/11/0/2 steals on .500/.500/1.00; complaining about robert covington's offensive production in the post-season is just letting dudes like cj, norm, nurk (guys you'd actually want, and expect, to contribute significantly) skate free of criticism."
"I watched Ben Simmons and Robert Covington play together for a season and a half, and at no point did I think Ben and RoCo were a spacing problem. Ben generates more three point assists for anyone in the league, RoCo would get more open threes playing next to him."
Derrick Rose didn’t have a problem with KAT. Robert Covington didn’t have a problem with KAT. Taj Gibson didn’t have a problem with KAT. Ricky Rubio never had a problem with KAT. Literally no one ever had a problem with KAT but Butler yet somehow KAT is the one to blame for running people off his team. Gotcha. Great argument.
Blazers: IDK? Rockets: Robert Covington Nuggets: Jermi Grant Heat: Bam. All pretty good
"That list of moves makes him an average GM. Picking up CP3 was the only elite move you mentioned. We also got Ariza on a filthy deal back in the day, which you didn't name.  Doesn't make him a top 5 GM, and the Harden trade doesn't make up for the difference. He doesn't understand stability or how to value talent. We cut/traded guys like Christian Wood, DeAnthony Melton, Robert Covington, etc. all because Morey doesn't understand talent. Our draft record was horrendous and then we didn't make a first round pick for 4 straight years before this one. He left our franchise in shambles and Stone has been building it up to a better point than Morey ever did."
"Who knows what they'd do - Jody Allen is apparently trying to sell the Blazers and it's easier to sell a competitive team (probably).  I imagine if the Blazers are blowing it up they'd clear house for all of the picks they can. Here's the rough deal:  Philly gets: Either Dame/CJ, Robert Covington  Minny gets: Ben Simmons  Portland gets: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, picks from BOTH Philly and Minny"
&gt;	 We saw Robert Covington a few times and each time he was just walking around by himself. One time he was just sitting alone at an empty blackjack table at Resorts World on his phone.  He’s just like me🙃
"Scrolled way too far to see this. Idc if you think SGA, Ja, Jaylen etc are better than him (they're not), putting him in a different tier entirely is utter disrespect. This mf put Fox in the same tier as Seth Curry, Fred Vanvleet, and Robert Covington"

And he’s not a salary dump-he’s an asset. I would say pretty similar to Robert Covington in terms of play. Portland had to give up 2 first round picks to acquire him. I think you could easily get one (20-30) first round pick for Kleber (if you had too).
Lonzo's defense is legit and the other 2 try. Put the 3 of them on the floor with like Robert Covington and they do fine defensively
This implies Kawhi has small legs like Robert Covington   Kawhi has a really nice posterior chain himself

"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
"No joke, I argued with a dude in our sub who wanted to trade Mitch straight up for Robert Covington……"
"If anything Toronto won the trade. They got rid of a guy they weren’t going to resign for a 22 year old averaging 16 on a playoff team. You act like Powell is a great player. He’s a really good bench player on a championship team, as shown in 2019. I don’t know why Portland traded one of their few young players for a 6th man who has a similar playing style to CJ McCollum. Portland’s has a lot of these desperation moves, like trading a first round pick for Robert Covington. How’d that turn out for them?"
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good. My favourite ""firm"" that operate in this particular sector of the game is ""The Ball Index"" ([twitter](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index)).

[The Method](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1405541308639244288?s=20)  **Basketball Index's All-Defensive 1st Team (**[tweet](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1405299149226926082?s=20)**)**  * Ben Simmons * Alex Caruso * Robert Covington * Draymond Green * Rudy Gobert  **Basketball Index's All-Defensive 2nd Team** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1405253847778574340?s=20))  * Matisse Thybulle * Dejounte Murray * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Tobias Harris * Clint Capela  **Basketball Index's All-Defensive 3rd Team** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1405216845498552324?s=20))  * Jrue Holiday * Russell Westbrook * Royce O'Neal * Kyle Anderson * Jakob Poeltl  **All-Defensive Role Team** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/The_BBall_Index/status/1405284052161101824?s=20))  * **Point of Attack:** Alex Caruso  * **Chaser:** Paul George  * **Wing Stopper:** Jimmy Butler  * **Helper:** Robert Covington  * **Perimeter Big:** Jarred Vanderbilt  * **Mobile Big:** Jusuf Nurkic  * **Anchor Big:** Rudy Gobert"
and Pascal Siakam and Robert Covington probably should be above the as well
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
"Oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with someone who spent 2 whole minutes on a player bref page after hearing about him for the first time. That kinda dedication to analysis just can't be matched. I salute your analytical prowess.   Every advanced stat backs him up:   1.6 Lebron (compares to: Derozan, Ja Morant, Robert Covington, Myles Turner)   1.7 EPM (compares to: Lowry, Middleton, Sabonis)   2.0 Raptor (compares to: Ayton, Vuc, Royce O'Neale, Joe Harris, Jaylen Brown)     He started in the closeout game for a championship team. He's a fantastic guard defender, hustles for loose balls, and has great IQ.   But I can see how all of that is easy to miss when the entirety of your bball knowledge is listening to Microsoft Narrator read you bref pages since your blindness prevents you from actually watching games."
"Who would you define as starting caliber, like a Robert Covington or Aaron Gordon?"
"""We're just one Robert Covington away from a 3-peat."""
"I think, as you pointed out, some significant roster overhaul was needed.  I'm not sure their 1st round pick situation but my Bulls just turned 3 future picks and a bunch of space parts in to Vucevic and Derozan, so the idea that Portland is stuck is just not trying hard enough.   Dame is absolutely in win now mode so mortgaging the future is the right move for the Blazers, especially knowing you can turn around and trade Dame for a cache of 1st rounders if it doesn't work out.  As an aside, they are paying Robert Covington, Tyler Zeller and Tony Snell a combined $39M which is just terrible."
We are probably not breaking up the Turner/Sabonis pairing for better or for worse and I imagine that a Ben Simmons trade would not only drain you of your draft assets but also Robert Covington as well   Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the Raptors swung again with a package centered around OG and FVV.
"The 4 has kinda evolved in the league today to big dudes that can shoot / defend. i.e. Robert Covington, Draymond Green etc"
I’d just want to see Norman Powell or Robert Covington being traded in exchange for an Oubre S&amp;T just to see this sub explode.   It’s more of a pipe dream but it’d be glorious.
"Thanks for the response.  I guess when I say ""terrible supporting cast,"" I mean in comparison to championship-caliber teams.  I don't believe that Dame has ever had a championship-quality team around him, or even close to one.  Damian's Trailblazers have always just been a 'good' team, but never great (again, just my opinion).  I don't think they'll be anywhere close to great just by adding Norman Powell. They need to rebuild while they can. Get some valuable pieces for Dame, C.J., and Robert Covington, and try again. What they're doing now is just wasting his career. He's loyal, but to a fault. If he wants to win a championship, it's not going to be with the Trailblazers. That's no fault of his own; upper management is to blame for not doing enough."
Robert Covington will usually shoot like 28% for half the season and then 50% for the other half lol
for a second I thought robert covington said this
"Thoughts on this three team trade I thought of this morning  Bulls Receive: Robert Covington  Trailblazers Receive: Pascal Siakam  Raptors Receive: Lauri Markkenen, Coby White, Anfernee Simmons, 2022 Trailblazers FRP, 2024 Trailblazers FRP"
Robert Covington agrees in sign language
Ariza is funny because he's the sort of dude *every* team wants. Pretty odd he hasn't stuck anywhere. Another one like that is Robert Covington. He's basically the ideal role player but he's already been on 6 teams at 30 years old.
Robert Covington energy
"No, he brought in shitty players. No one would want or pay for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Nerlens Noel, or Christian Wood on their rosters to support their stars."
"You'd think this guy is a McDonalds cashier by the way Celtics fans talk about him and some other Celtics younger players, but he's like a better Robert Covington against us. Jayson and Jaylen play well against the Raps but nothing too exceptional, it's more or less every other Celtic that scares me so much."
"Other names that come to mind beside OG are Mikal Bridges, Lu Dort, Robert Covington  OG shot 39% from 3 on 6 attempts a game.   Bridges shot 42% on 4 attempts a game.   Dort shot 34% on 6 attempts a game.   Covington shot 38% on 5 attempts a game.   So Bridges had the highest percentage. OG shot the best on more attempts.  Defense is subjective, some metrics favor OG, some I assume would favor Dort or Bridges.   I think based on the numbers it's really a toss-up between OG and Bridges right now, as pure 3nD players."
"**Block A:** Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  This is a toss-up and ultimately a win-win situation no matter what.    **Block B:** Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Matisse Thybulle, Cut Robert Covington  I think Anderson is easier to fit into any starting lineup due to his range of skills. Matisse's lack of offense/spacing makes it tough + he's been good off the bench. RoCo is too hot/cold.     **Block C**: Start Cade, Bench Mobley, Cut Jalen Green  Ignoring potential, right now Cade is the most pro-ready. And Mobley's mix of length, athleticism, playmaking, touch, and defense should allow him to adapt quicker than Green."
"He’s on my “all-hypothetical all-star” team with Lonzo Ball, Josh Richardson, Robert Covington, &amp; Otto Porter."
"Oh, you're one of those. Yea the team would be much better off it they had built around Jrue Holiday as a #1 option  Ask Robert Covington and TJ McConnell how much they hated getting a real shot at NBA minutes"
"I mean, if you're gonna name them you should also name all the 2nd round picks and undrafted FA's we signed and developed. Namely: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc."
"Eh, I mean i hear that  say that and I hear the max contraxt he signed with Detroit was around there, and he didn’t live up to that. But 15 million isn’t best or second best player on the team money anymore. It’s like, timberwolves Robert Covington was considered insanely flexible and good value for that amount."
What’s the current “better in theory” team?   PG - ???  SG - Josh Richardson  SF - ???  PF - Robert Covington   C - Myles Turner
"I agree, that wasn't commented towards you specifically, but just speaking in general of what i see in terms of general consensus (by upvotes as proxy) comments from dubs flairs. I didnt mean to put words in your mouth, so I apologize.   My comment to you was more ""how does he fit moreso than any other 3&amp;D guy does."" Like how would he fit you better than a Jeremi Grant type or a Dillon Brooks type or a Robert Covington type etc.  &gt; think you know team building math better than the FO of a championship team, so rock on.  That's just an appeal to authority argument not actually attacking the argument itself that results have been less than the sum of supposed variables. And I'm not inclined to believe its the Steph Curry variables part of the equation.  I dont think ""I know better"" I dont know what actual deals other teams were putting on the table, I just know Wiggins is fine, but hes not this special player people need to fawn over and thats just what I see on this sub. Sorry for seeing it I guess."
"I think it actually helped those guys on an individual level. They gave a lot of players actual minutes to grow and develop against top talent, rather than sit on the back of the bench and only play 3-on-3 at the end of practice. And look at Richaun Holmes, Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, even Nerlens Noel now as well. They're all doing awesome around the league"
Sixers ended up getting Jimmy Butler for Robert Covington and Dario Saric after a shitty beginning of a season with these sorts of rumors. Think that's where it ends up?
"Offer 1: Damian Lillard   Offer 2: CJ McCollum, Robert Covington and 3 1sts   Offer 3: CJ McCollum and Robert Covington   Offer 4: CJ McCollum and a 1st   Offer 5: CJ McCollum   Offer 6: Robert Covington and a 1st  Offer 7: Robert Covington"
So is letting the best player in our franchise history walk because the only move we've made to help a guy that's the only all star on his team in 5 years is trading for Robert Covington
"I was rooting for the bucks. I know giannis has a beef with harden, but harden also dumped us and went out of shape so that we would get no assets for his trade, saying in his last press conference that we didn’t have enough skill, chemistry, or talent. I was rooting for cp3, but that team just has so many floppers it was hard to root for. I’m so happy for pj tucker. Losing him and Robert Covington, and Jeff green hurt me the most :("
"I feel for Kings fans man we’ve been hoodwinked for years by our old management in the exact same ways as them. They’re gonna trade 9 for like Robert Covington just to miss out on a star draft pick while making the 10 seed each year, and eventually blowing it up in 2025"
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
"&gt; some dirty work  Mikal Bridges, Danny Green, PJ Tucker and Robert Covington entered the chatroom"
"Robert Covington, he's a decent 3 and D SF/PF who fits the Warriors ""win now"" timeline and can replace Wiggins minutes."
Robert Covington has been allergic to open layups since Philly and it’s good to know he hasn’t changed lol
"You are correct, I think Portland traded some picks for Robert Covington right? And from what I can recall, Milwaukee was pretty set up to insert Jrue and be a lot better. Feel like Portland would need a lot more work. Plus Lebron and Giannis already being there are better then Dame, so there's also that."
"If Khris made it more of a point to be in the public eye, we'd talk about him like we do a Paul George or a Jamal Murray. Khris is good. Ain't no reason to act like he's fuckin' Robert Covington out there. Khris is certainly better than Kyrie for the Bucks."
Robert Covington ----&gt; Trevor Ariza ------&gt; Klay Thompson (all in their primes)
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
"That was godlike incompetence by the rockets. Sadly we don’t have the picks necessary to get Dame. I could see us potentially getting Robert Covington or McCollum if Portland decides to blow things up, but we would still have to get lucky to do that"
He’s about the same height as modern power forwards like Jae Crowder or Robert covington
Only trade I remember Houston doing before Harden asked out was getting rid of Robert Covington for old ass trevor ariza and draft picks. Thats not a win now move
"I know this post is a few days old but when I say build around Dame what I mean is stuff like:  A) Wasting time and money on old bums like Carmelo Anthony to ""win now"" instead of developing.. anyone else.  B) Signing CJ to a long, big contract extension shortly after Damian Lillard signed his supermax.  This one is very damaging.  This extension is just now kicking in, despite being signed shortly after Dame signed his supermax.  If Dame forces his way out this summer, they will be left with CJ's extension kicking in and they'll have to find a way to unload him now, possibly giving up assets just to do it because moving contracts like that isn't easy, despite him being a good player.  So not only will it be work to get rid of him they were also robbed of actually getting assets for him a year or so ago.  C) In a ""win now"" move, traded 22 year old rookie contract Gary Trent Jr for Norman Powell who just opted out and is now a FA.  What happens if Dame leaves?  Worst case they just RIP'd an asset, best they sign Norman to a big new deal and try to move him in the future.   We could rattle off examples for days, like how they don't have a 2021 draft pick because they traded it for Robert Covington.  So to respond to your initial statement, which offers a valid point but imo comes to the wrong conclusion.  They indeed did build around Dame, they just didn't do it very well.  It's also worth noting, given CJ's extension following shortly after Dame's that Dame himself very well may have been a vocal factor in this move.  As he was in wasting time on washed up Melo.  It's not something we haven't seen before, if franchises completely give in and essentially make their star the GM of the team it can backfire in the future (ie lebron with cleveland, and I see you with that lakers icon, if they aren't careful them too).  At least with LeBron he might leave your franchise desolate but you get a ring out of it so can't complain too much."
"76ers - Dame, Buddy Hield  Kings - Ben Simmons, Robert Covington, Isiah Joe  Blazers - Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, 2021 #9 pick (Kings), 2021 #28 Pick (76ers), 2022 Pick Swap, 2023 Top 5 Protected Pick (Kings), 2024 Unprotected Pick (76ers)."
If I did this for the modern NBA and try not to make it too crazy:  Ben Simmons  Lonzo Ball  Luka Doncic  Robert Covington  Bamonte Adebayo
I don't know how serious these discussions are (or if they're even real in the first place) but I imagine a serious hang-up in these conversations would be Robert Covington. I honestly imagine that the 76ers don't have enough leverage to ask for him at this point.
"&gt; Yeah, my mistake for interpreting his starting 5 exactly as he presented it. Fuck me, right?  I guess? Just seems weird that you wouldn't assume the ability of the coach to just play whatever lineup they think is best. Like did you assume come playoff time they wouldn't be allowed to have lineup adjustments? But whatever, my bad for assuming, sorry.  &gt; Oh, please. Every contending small ball team in the last 5 years could at least shoot from 4 out of 5 positions.  Yes I agree, if clarke was playing big minutes next to simmons there would be problems. But besides that I just don't see the need for 5 shooters. The whole point of small ball is to have 5 quality offensive players, and so that you don't have to play some unskilled big (e.g. rudy gobert). Simmons would still be a fantastic small ball 5, on offense at the very least.  &gt; And so is saying they are a contender when you have multiple teams with top 10 players they have to compete against. Simmons can’t be your second best player on a championship team.  I think the jury is still out on Ben Simmons when he has a team built to accommodate his deficiencies. Sure this team would never be favored to beat the nets or lakers, but the way most people use the term ""contender"" is fairly broad. I could say something like ""a team with devin booker as their best player when there are teams with multiple top 10 players will never be a contender,"" but most people consider the suns to be weak contenders at worst. Also FYI I never even said this team would be contending, although I think they would be, when you consider the normal, broad definition of the term.  I'll just add, in 2017-2018, the sixers went 52-30 and were the 3rd seed in the east (this was good enough for 3rd in the west too). Joel Embiid played 63/82 games last year. Jo/Ben's best supporting players were robert covington, jj redick and dario saric. Fucking Jerryd Bayless played about 20mpg in the regular season. In other words the supporting cast was dogshit and they had 60 games of embiid instead of james harden, and that team still was the 3rd seed. I hope this shows why reading that the team in OP's post has a ceiling of 5th seed gives me an aneurysm."
"&gt;ESPN's Stephen A. Smith reported on ""First Take"" on Wednesday morning that the most recent Blazers and Sixers trade talks have centered around shooting guard C.J. McCollum, along with other pieces:  &gt;""According to my sources, they're talking about C.J. McCollum, they're talking about Robert Covington, they're talking about a couple first-round picks.   &gt;""The 76ers have not been willing to bite."""
"Listen I get that the model looks at injury seasons unfavorably but cmon man lets be real for a second. Even if klay doesnt get his legs back and isnt a great defender anymore or cant drive to hoop like he used to his shooting alone will allow him to be at the very least a rotation player. This same metric has kevin durant, kyrie and bradley beal as borderline allstars while FVV is an allstar?? Likewise in what world in robert covington a borderline allstar?!? I dont care what advanced metrics they used to create this list, anyone with eyes who has actually watched basketball will tell you this list is complete garbage."
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Derrick White, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Joel Embiid  Bench: Ricky Rubio, Seth Curry, Joe Ingles, OG Anunoby, Robert Covington, Domantas Sabonis, Nerlens Noel"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
PG: Ricky Rubio  SG: Danny Green  SF: Robert Covington  PF: Draymond Green  C: Steven Adams
"Replies like this are so brain dead annoying. You're going to sit here and tell me that CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Jusuf Nurkic, Robert Covington and Larry Nance aren't assets that would return value in a trade?"
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
Are you saying Kyrie and KD aren’t at the same level as Robert Covington?
PG: Malcom Brogdon (4)  SG: Luka Doncic (1)  SF: Saddiq Bey (3)  PF: Robert Covington (5)  C: Anthony Davis (2)  6: Gary Trent Jr. (6)  7: Mo Bamba (7)
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Alex Caruso  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Joel Embiid  Bench  LaMelo Ball / Jamal Murray / Austin Rivers / Lu Dort / Jae Crowder / Robert Covington / Clint Capela  I legitimately think this team can go 82-0 if injuries are not a factor.
"I’m going to try to also just include mainly role players.    C: Myles Turner  PF: Giannis  SF: KD  SG: Klay Thompson  PG: Jrue Holiday   Bench:  Reggie Jackson  Seth Curry  Matisse Thybulle  Robert Covington  Joe Ingles  Bobby Portis  Brook Lopez     Definitely could be better when some of the non All Star picks but without picking fringe All Stars, I like this team. Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn’t sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
"PG: Shai Gilgeous Alexander  SG: Paul George (allstar)  SF:  Kevin Durant (superstar)  PF: Jayson Tatum (allstar)  C: Joel Embiid (superstar)  \---  Bench PG: Fred Vanvleet  Bench SG: Mikal Bridges  Bench SF: OG Anunoby  Bench PF: Robert Covington  Bench C: Myles Turner  \---  Third string: Marcus Smart  Third string: Marcus Morris  &amp;#x200B;  I think starting lineup is basically impossible to guard. Bench is more so developed to focus on defense and basically hold the fort down while my starting lineup rests. Third string are luxury players for niche lineups. For Marcus Morris specifically, I think he may be the player best suited to do a small ball closing lineup at center of non-stars/non-superstars."
Robert Covington if Lillard gets traded
"Robert Covington is the epitome of this, on paper a perfect 3 and D player. He is cheap enough that desperate teams will keep trading for him to make a push (Rockets, Blazers) but not actually good enough to make much of a difference. Jae Crowder to an extent is as well, if there was a pokemon evolution line it would be Solomon Hill -&gt; Covington -&gt; Crowder"
Robert Covington
TIL I learned Robert Covington is a second option. Weird how his career high ppg is 13. Your whole comment is so laughable I won’t even entertain the ridiculous points like Covington has the same strengths lmaooo
No that’s not my logic lol. You tried to stretch it to extremes of bit role players when we’re talking about a second option who averaged 20+  ppg for a GOAT team. To equate him Robert Covington is a joke and shows that you just really undervalue klay or are weirdly defensive about demar. I lean towards that latter considering your last statement. Never said demar was a failure lmao.  Actually now that I think about it in this analogy klay is worse than Covington since russ&gt;demar. Totally ridiculous.
I don’t see why it matters? I mean most contenders would rather have a Robert Covington than a Russell Westbrook. Who would you say is better?  Floor raising matters
Robert Covington prior to Portland trade and now SGA
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/robert-covington/  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/kevin-durant/  Bonus: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-player-projections/jimmer-fredette/   Do I need to say more?
I’m judging his contract off his PPG and role  Is Robert Covington getting 23 million right now? You’re basically getting the same thing from Covington and Gordon other than the fact Gordon has cool dunks sometimes
"Not that it means anything, but if you cross reference the Athletic top 125 with players listed in this thread the order would come out to: Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby. Also, havent seen him mentioned yet, but Joe Ingles could be in the mix as well."
1.Mikal Bridges   2. OG Anunoby   3 Marcus Smart   4. Robert Covington   5. PJ Tucker
Robert Covington deserves to be on that list.  Possibly as high as 3rd in my opinion
Robert Covington is a commonly listed one. Klay is also the ultimate 3&amp;D guy when/if he is healthy.

"Seriously. They didn’t get 60+ games in any of the last 3 seasons from Malik Beasley, D’Angelo Russell, Robert Covington, or even Teague… they’ve had significant missed time from the guys that would get them in the playoffs"
"I never said it was a fluke. He's just clearly got a more limited skillset than almost any other star  Like what does he do that say, Robert Covington doesnt? Nothing. He's just better at the same things."
Idk man. I’ve always thought they could’ve waited and instead taking their shot at something like Clint Capela and Robert Covington for about the same price they gave up for KP. Maybe I’m wrong though and they would’ve gotten something far worse as they waited for Giannis. At least THJ has been a great fit
"He wasn’t for his career but he did last year, similar to Robert Covington who also can no longer really play the 3 and the advanced stats show is much more favorable as a 4 or small ball 5."
"Even in the last 5 years , prime Jimmy Butler for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a second round pick was a travesty, especially if Houston’s 4 FRP offer was real. I get that RoCo was a valuable role player in his prime and Saric was coming off a really good sophomore season, but that isn’t enough for what Butler offers"
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
Robert covington
"Yeah, I’m not sure if it’s enough. I don’t think it’s a terrible offer though.   Trade value can plummet when a player threatens to sit out. For instance, Philadelphia traded Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler when he demanded a trade. This proposed offer from the Timberwolves is certainly better than that trade. Beasley is a 40%, high volume shooter, McDaniels has a lot of potential, Reid is a solid backup center, and Beverley has a ton of playoff experience. The 76ers also have a chance to package the first round picks for a Star later.   Honestly, I’m not really sure if a drastically better offer is out there:  -	The Raptors reportedly don’t want Simmons after drafting Scottie Barnes. Which makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Warriors don’t think that Simmons and Draymond fit. Which also makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Kings are unwilling to offer Fox or Haliburton, and an offer based around Buddy Hield seems similar to the Wolves current offer.  -	The Trailblazers aren’t trading Lillard. Maybe they’re willing to trade CJ? I’m not sure about that though, cause CJ and Lillard are best friends. There are also reports that the Trailblazers think Simmons is too ball dominant for Lillard. Plus, I don’t think Simmons can really coexist with Nurkic and Nance."
"My guess was the Kings, but since 2011 the Rockets' favored partner was the Timberwolves, with 6 trades:  * Clint Capela out, Robert Covington in * Troy Daniels out, Corey Brewer in * cash out, Alessandro Gentile in * Chase Budinger out, Terrence Jones in * B.Miller/Mirotic/Parsons out, Flynn/Motiejunas in * cash out, Parsons right back in lol"
If it was just for CJ I'd be disappointed. There's obviously fit concerns with Simmons and Nurk - at least Embiid can stretch the floor.  I imagine that if Philly actually wants to engage with Portland they're going to try like hell to get Robert Covington because they need to replace Ben's wing defense. Portland has no reason to get rid of RoCo though unless they're blowing it up.
Robert Covington. Bring him back.
And Robert Covington
"&gt;He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington.   How is having these guys on your team for a hot minute and trading them/waiving them before they actually develop supposed to be a point in his favor? I do give him credit for the Covington acquisition/contract (see some of my previous posts) and sure McConnell is a fine player for his pedigree, but the fact the Sixers had every opportunity to cycle through 2nd rounders/UDFAs and give them playing time and only got two players out of it who actually stuck around for the team becoming competitive is exactly why I don't think he's some genius GM like his defenders purport. It'd be a bigger issue if NONE of these guys stuck but the absence of complete failure doesn't automatically make Hinkie good.  I don't see anyone giving the Hornets credit just for taking a flier on Wood because their GM doesn't have a cult of personality around them."
"&gt; after your fan base gave up on him anyway.  care to go back and find the thread where we traded jerami grant? because very few people were in favor of that move. you do realize that Hinkie didn't trade Jerami, correct?  Richaun Holmes isn't very good? So he's better or worse than Dwight?  Robert Covington isn't a good player?  You do realize that keeping Jrue means that we likely never get a chance to draft Embiid, correct? Like we didn't have Embiid on the roster before we traded Jrue. You do know that right?"
"&gt; It’s only now after they failed you’re calling them bad.  many people in our sub were calling out the tobias trade when it happened. most of us were fooled with the horford signing.  &gt;Same thing once Doc got fired from the clippers y’all were thirsty as fuck  this is a blanket statement. many many many fans were against the rivers signing. including myself.  Hinkie never got a chance to finish what he started. So it's mostly an unknown. He made some poor decisions but the franchise was still set up to have significantly more success than any era since Dr. J.  Which picks of his were ""horrid""? Okafor. You got another? Here's some players Hinkie acquired outside of the top 10.  Jerami Grant  TJ McConnell  Richaun Holmes  Robert Covington  Dario Saric (drafted elfrid payton and flipped him to the magic for a FRP. The magic moved essentially two spots in a draft from 14 to 12 for a FRP)  Hinkie also refused to bog the franchise down with long-term bullshit contracts which gave the team massive flexibility.   This is not even to mention that we had players like Alex Caruso and Christian Wood in the summer league and on the NBA roster during this time period. Not going to give Hinkie credit for that as they did not stay with the team very long.  Hinkie was the GM for 1.5 years until Jerry was hired. he was essentially forced out of power after Jerry joined.  I challenge you to name another GM who acquired that type of talent outside the top 10 in the draft in the course of two off-seasons."
"&gt;moves on the margins for anyone  He picked up fringe guys who have since bloomed like Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, and Richaun Holmes, and also role players like TJ McConnell and Robert Covington. That's pretty encouraging foresight. He saw that MCW wasn't going to last and shipped out the ROY-winner.  He whiffed on Okafor and Nerlens, but even those are tough because the only legit players who went close behind them were McCollum and Kristaps, who refused to work out with us.  I agree that he had bad relationships with agents, but he seemed to have a solid eye for talent"
"Wolves got Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton (who was our first round pick at like 14 the year before).  &amp;nbsp;  When a player makes it known he wants out and the team holding him tries to hold out for the best offer sometimes you have to accept a deal for peanuts."
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn’t trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
"To get KAT and D'lo to the playoffs? Which is kinda the goal with 2 (3 with Simmons) young-ish franchise pieces.  Like its been fun slandering Ben Simmons all summer, but at bare minimum he is a supercharged James Johnson/Robert Covington on defense and the fit with those 2 definitely wasn't bad. And the wolves have the spacing to absorb him into their rotation and use Ben for his other strengths.  It's not ring or bust. Especially for a franchise like Minnesota"
Wtf does Robert Covington think he's Jake the Snake Roberts or some shit?
You're underselling it.  [He definitely has at least a foot long snake.](https://uproxx.com/dimemag/robert-covington-joel-embiid-sixers-python-snake-team-meeting/)
Robert Covington has a 9 inch cock
"&gt; CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Bruh. Wat. No. We would never do this. If anything, CJ straight up, but even then, we shouldn't. Young Socialite doesn't want to play here. He isn't worth the bad chemistry."
"I almost feel for Philly here because Simmons trade value just tanked even further. It sucks for Philly fans because Morey I think was trying to get the best possible return for Ben, but sheesh. Ben really don’t give a fuck about the organization. He just wants out, and now he might have to get shipped out for like Robert Covington and a pack of menthols."
"CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, Nassir Little  Derrick White, Thaddeus Young, Lonnie Walker, 2024 unprotected 1st, 2025 swap, 2025 bulls 1st  Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverly, Okogie, 2022 pick swap, 2023 Unprotected 1st, 2025 unprotected 1st  Tyrese Halliburton, Buddy Hield, Marvin Bagley, 2022 pick swap, 2023 1st, 2025 1st  I’m still acting as if he’s a positive asset. I think most of these deals are fair-ish and realistic"
"I think *ideally* for Philly, and **this is a longshot to happen** is a trade to the Raptors for OG and FVV.  Ben has a lot of faults, but the two things he can provide are ball-handling and defending the opponent's best player. Having both of those duties for 1 player is huge and to realistic replace those duties it'd require 2 players back. FVV and OG provide that.  A shittier version of that would be one of Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and Harrison Barnes.   That's always been my issue with a CJ trade - Philly is going to kick and scream to get Robert Covington back too because if Ben's gone - who's going to defend the 3 on the 76ers? Old-ass Danny Green?"
"&gt; Hasn't regressed on defense or as a passer/playmaker. Just lost faith in his shot. &gt;  &gt;   His AST per 36 has regressed from 8.7 in 17-18 to 8.1 in 18-20 to 7.7 in 20-21. His Defensive Win Shares has regressed from 5.0 in 17-18 to 3.3 in 20-21. His VORP has dropped from 4.5 to 3.8 to 2.8 to 2.2.  &gt;Same guy who is only 25!!, elite on the fast break, elite defending the wing, a great passer, and who scores 15 ppg despite a clear mental block. literally all he would need to be effective in the playoffs is getting ft's up to 60% and building confidence.  And has a reputation for putting in as little work in as possible. Plus, wing defense is overrated; it's better to have a great defender who can score than a shut-down defender who can't, because there isn't a single ""shut-down"" defender who can actually shut down a superstar scorer.  &gt;Identify the player Phi could acquire who would be better than Simmons (since you are trading away potential/youth/team control) and the picks that would accompany him.  Patrick Beverley and Robert Covington would be better for the 76ers than Simmons by virtue of taking up less of the salary cap, while providing defense and scoring. Even Danny Green, washed as he is, would probably be better value for the 76ers.  &gt;If the answer is no one, then it's a terrible trade.  Yeah, it's a terrible trade both ways. Simmons costs to much for what he is and does, and there's no way the 76ers will be able to get what they believe to be commiserate value because others teams simply don't think Simmons is worth what they're asking.  To put it another way: Simmons is like a very beautiful woman who you've married in Vegas after getting really drunk, except when you actually get to know her, you discover she's vapid, a persecution complex, complains to the manager of every business she walks into, and has a Hitler tramp stamp. And all of this ends up on display because she makes enough of a scene to be on the local news.  You might be into her for how good she looks and her potential to become a good person once you fix her, but most people are going to look at her and think she's not worth the trouble."
That’s almost as bad as trading two first for Robert Covington
"The OP purposely left out large parts of the article. Other important information  &gt; That accept-the-qualifying-offer, bet-on-yourself tactic—in addition to client-poaching from other agents—has drawn ire from Paul's rivals in the agency world. To be fair, they are often guilty of the same activities; a significant portion of income for larger agencies is generated by poaching clients before a player's next lucrative deal.  &gt;The National Basketball Players Association does not prohibit certified agents from contacting other certified agents' clients, a noted contrast to the NBA's tampering rules, prohibiting team executives from contacting rival teams' talent. That stance has frustrated many agents for years.  &gt;And it's not just Paul.  &gt;Sources told Bleacher Report that Victor Oladipo was influenced to leave longtime representative Aaron Turner of Versus Management for Excel Sports just before free agency this summer. Excel gave Oladipo the same sales pitch: a new agent can deliver more money than the previous one. In this case, like Noel's, they didn't deliver.  &gt;Back in 2017, Robert Covington left his agent Chris Patrick (who helped land the two-way forward his first legitimate NBA stop in Philadelphia) for behemoth CAA Sports ahead of signing a four-year, $62 million deal.  &gt;Oladipo and Covington are merely two of a long list of examples.  &gt;The union has never shown much interest in policing such backchanneling. But a popular solution often mentioned by agents is saving 1 percent of the commission on a player's next contract for the previous representative, which would likely require some form of arbitration.  &gt;""It is wild to see all of it aired out like this,"" another veteran agent said. ""It happens all the time, but it never becomes public. It happens around the draft even. Guys will say anything to convince these players to come.""  &gt;Maybe these headlines do go away and Noel's filing was simply a public gesture against the agent he feels wronged him. ""I'll pay you this 200 grand, but I'm gonna s--t in your cornflakes before I do,"" one representative who previously worked with Noel said.  &gt;The majority of league sources contacted by B/R do expect the union to settle some type of agreement between these two parties, being that a legitimate legal battle benefits neither Klutch nor Noel. For Noel to win $58 million in alleged lost salary, he would seemingly face a daunting uphill battle in a court of law.  &gt;""The truth is Nerlens is not innocent in this,"" another agent said. ""If you're silly enough to turn down that kind of money, that's not on Rich.""  &gt;Paul's defense would be simple: An agent can never be held accountable for accurately predicting the future. He was providing a client with counsel, counsel that Noel did not have to accept, and if Noel did not suffer an injury, he very well could have garnered a richer deal.  &gt;That following summer, in 2018, Clint Capela scored a five-year, $90 million contract from the Rockets, a solid payday for a bouncy pick-and-roll threat and rim-protector of similar ilk.  &gt;Noel's case relies on the argument that Paul did not act in Noel's best interest, that Paul had no part in pitching the center to the Thunder in 2018 or sufficiently marketing him to other teams the following seasons.  &gt;It likely would be very challenging, however, for Noel's defense to find a team figure willing to come forward and confirm that series of events as a witness at trial. It's a sensitive topic that multiple league personnel declined to comment on for this article."
"Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges, Kris Middleton"
"That's not how it happened. Jimmy requested a trade when the season ended as he was unhappy with the Wolves. Jimmy would have been unhappy with any team where he wasn't the unquestioned star. Thibs ignored the trade request and let the team fall apart. There was no reason for KAT to rush into extension talks as he was guaranteed the max extension. He had every reason to wait to see how the Butler situation would play out before resigning.   Thibs played the hand poorly, waited until he had no leverage and ended up settling for a package of Dario Saric and Robert Covington for Butler. None of that was KAT's fault."
"I’m a 6’1 Robert Covington, streaky shooting, bad handle and good defense"
"That's cuz you see him keeping up with more 3s and 4s than actual quick 2s. Yuta from what i seen only has quickness to keep up with mobile 3s and 4s. LOL at that point, you might as well call PJ tucker, Robert Covington a 2 guard. You know that's not the case."
yes it does. cj at the time is a better player than mpj. they both suck on defense . dame and jokic are both mvp level players. i prefer jokic but dame is still good. nurkic as a third option is comparable to aaron gordon. then you go into the part that makes portland better norman powell is better than everyone else on the nuggets. the players that were missing from the nuggets drop their depth alot. robert covington is better too than most of the rest of the nuggets players. pj doizer will barton and jamal all out they trade away monte morris for gordon. pretty much had no guards left over. then you have enes a turn style on defense but can give you a good 5 minutes when jokic. on paper blazer are much better than the injured nuggets. coaching really did them a big diservice. terry stotts should have been fired years ago.
"I’ve never come away from an Aaron Gordon performance thinking, “that guy might be an All-Star”.  He’s in the Robert Covington tier of role players."
So you're saying that the Lakers should trade AD for Robert Covington.
The sixers also had:  Jerami Grant  Richaun Holmes  Christian Wood  Alex Caruso  Robert Covington  Nerlens Noel
yeah I don't need Robert Covington shooting 43% on midrange Js lol
"What's the best (realistic, in terms of contracts/roles/ego) set of complimentary players to pair with Luka, for a team where he is clearly the best player? (E.g., I'm not including lineups where he teams up with other MVP-level players.)  Would you roll out two guards with him, or an extra wing? I feel like a heliocentric Luka team would need to focus on 3&amp;D role players.   We all know Cuban has coveted Klay for a long time and he's obviously the best complimentary piece to just about any star. Who else? Maybe Malcolm Brogdon for 3&amp;D plus secondary playmaking? Then add Robert Covington as a forward and Clint Capela as a defense/PNR dynamo?   Brogdon/Klay/Luka/RoCo/Capela is probably the best ""realistic"" team you could assemble around Luka, where he is the best player/center of the team. Anyone think they have a better one?"
More like Jae Crowder or Robert Covington imo
"So, he sees the game so well, AND he's super smart.   He strips Gobert at least twice simply by seeing the play develop about a half second ahead of time and just knowing where the ball is going to be. Same with the strip on Mitchell; impeccable timing and placement.  But the play that really stood out to me? At 1:37 - when he knows the ball is going to Dame before the pass reaches Robert Covington. He fronts the ballhandler, and as they pass it he turns, sees Covington in the corner, realizes, then turns and sprints right toward open Dame to lock him up before the ball reaches Covington's hands.   That kind of IQ is off the charts for a rookie who hasn't played these folks before.  And that's not even mentioning his balletic on ball defense (with a pirouette even at 00:25!). His feet are quick, he moves just outside the range of the defender and keeps his hands down almost every time to keep from fouling. This is the first time I've seen him play and it's impressive."
"Oh for sure. I’m not saying he would be what he is in Detroit necessarily (but like you said lots of other factors go into getting better regardless) but to say that it was an okay move is wrong I think. Jermai Grant on the Sixers was worlds better than Christian Wood on the Sixers ever was and was already on the edge of being a valuable role player at the point he was traded. He certainly could have provided as much value as a year of Ersan (on a bad team) over his contract and most likely would have developed at least a little more as well.  And I agree that the Sixers do not have the best development coaching but Jerami Grant was a second round pick process Sixer who stuck on the team for two years (a real sign in those days; we were shuffling anyone and everyone around on 10-day contracts so if you stayed that long it meant something) on teams full of other young developing players. The Sixers have certainly not been close to the player development level of the Raptors or anything but during the Process years they did find/develop a number of late round picks or exiled free agents like Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, etc. It certainly wasn’t unreasonable for late draft pick young players to develop with the Sixers back then"
Robert Covington
"The 10-72 Sixers had Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Christian Wood, and Robert Covington"
"Jerami Grant, TJ McConnell, and Robert Covington are all guys off the top of my head developed by Brett Brown into good players and have gotten solid contracts to prove it.  Their improvement from g-league level players to starter level is way more impressive than Ben’s."
"In the NBA, a dollar is worth more than four quarters. That is, a guy who puts up 24/8/8 is worth *way more* than four times what four guys putting up 7/2/2 are worth.   Luka puts up 26/8/8 with average defense.   Trae puts up 24/4/9 with bad defense. Cam Reddish (part of the trade) puts up 11/4/1 with good defense.   Luka is the dollar to Trae 50-cent coin and Cam's quarter, but it's closer than people think imo. If Luka becomes an MVP putting up 32/9/9 on good efficiency and decent defense at his peak, but Trae becomes a top 3 PG putting up 28/2/10 on better efficiency, and Cam becomes a solid starting quality player, it's more like ninety cents to Luka's dollar. But in the end, I think the Mavs are on top.   As an analogy -- would a team rather have peak Lebron, or peak Lillard and peak Robert Covington? I think 30 out of 30 teams take Lebron."
"I have no idea why the hell the 76ers would not accept CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, and a first for Ben Simmons."
"The NBA and Blazers content I have consumed seems to indicate restructuring is a possibility... there has clearly been some discussion of Simmons to POR. Doesn't mean it is likely to happen, but it is a realistic possibility.   https://ripcityproject.com/2021/09/22/portland-trail-blazers-rumors-ben-simmons-cj-mccollum/  ""In the last 24 hours, controversial talking head Stephen A. Smith added his two cents, saying that sources had informed him of a potential Portland Trail Blazers package involving CJ McCollum, Robert Covington, and picks.      Stephen A clearly isn’t a reputable source for information around whether certain trades work under the league’s CBA rules, but he is likely to have league sources who have given him this info.      There have been multiple reports though that confirm this, from sources such as Woj, and ESPN’s Zach Lowe.      This package may be slightly inflated as a starting point, as Covington is worth one or two first-round picks on his own, so there is no way Neil Olshey sends multiple picks as per the report from Stephen A. The likely deal would be Covington and McCollum and a pick, and then the Sixers send one player back make the salaries match, and then even up the deal."""
"This almanac is consistently amazing, but [Robert Covington apparently being more clutch than Lillard](https://i.imgur.com/gouTEw4.png) is all I'm going to take away from this year."
Robert Covington or Seth Curry
Robert Covington and Saric for Jimmy Butler was a complete robbery by the Sixers and setup the Sixers to compete for a good 5-7 year window with Butler and Embiid.
Robert Covington was never that amazing
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"
Ah yes center Robert Covington.
"That Dame game was so nuts. It's insane that a player can do stuff like that and not even be in the Top 5 conversation. I think the distance between him and Steph is smaller than most people think.  I really do think Dame has what it takes to be an all time great, but his teams always never seem to reach the heights he needs to be taken more seriously. This game was a perfect example of that. Pretty sure Robert Covington bricked not one, but TWO DUNKS in the towards the end of the game, and no one could score reliably other than Dame."
"Not current, but that 4 team trade that saw the rockets shipping out Capela and Gerald Green for about half a season of Robert Covington was one of the worst deals I’ve ever seen  I knew it in the moment, I know it now, that deal was just as bad if not worse than the Chris Paul trade (in terms of trade balance, not overall impact)"
Well Robert Covington and Brandon Jennings are in my top 10
"I thought he was gonna be a solid bench player that teams would want. Not in terms of play, but in terms of role, what Robert Covington is. I thought he’d be a fringe starter that should really be a sixth/seventh man. And even THAT was wrong."
Robert Covington? Jerami Grant? Joel Embiid? Lol
"What playoff-bound team is going to be so desperate they’ll suddenly up their offers for a guy who hasn’t played for half a season and whose team basically has to entirely structure their whole offense around him to be productive? His value has been in a nosedive ever since the dunk that never was and we have no evidence an injury elsewhere is going to magically reverse that course. Plus, even an injured team just has to beat out the best alternative offer, which is piss poor at the moment and for the foreseeable future. You’d have to have multiple teams with injuries to get into a bidding war to get his value back up to all-star return. Portland is not a Robert Covington calf strain away from trading Lillard for Simmons lol."

"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."
"Kyle Lowry-Devin Booker-Robert Covington-Ben Simmons-Porzingis  3 high level defenders, 4 willing and able shooters around Simmons, rim protection with KP and Covington, and 2 playoff tested shot creators to make up for Simmons lack of skill in that area. Also 2 elite level passers and a very good one in Booker   It really depends a lot on if you think KP can get to a better defensive level than he’s show in Dallas though, you could swap him for Myles Turner but you’re losing some of the shooting upside"
"Robert Covington. Scores, Rebounds, Assist, Steals, Blocks, Threes"
I completely disagree. Being on a playoff team is sometimes terrible for these guys because they can’t get playing time to develop.  Look at a guy like Robert Covington for instance. He was undrafted and bounced around the league and couldn’t get play time till the process sixers developed him while tanking.
Yeah people have to look at the assets he left them with:  * Joel Embiid - C * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons) - PF/PG * Jerami Grant  - PF * Christian Wood - PF/C * Richaun Holmes - C * Robert Covington - PF * Dario Saric - PF/C * Nerlens Noel - C * Jahlil Okafor- C  Do people seriously think Hinkie was getting full return on what was the single greatest PF/C logjam in NBA history?  Do people seriously think Hinkie would have saved the 76ers from Colangelo/Brand overinvesting in PFs and Cs?  They had to sell guys at a loss because they had no place for **NINE** +6'10 guys who couldn't shoot.
"**PG:** Ben Simmons   **SG:**  **SF:** Robert Covington  **PF:** Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, Dario Saric   **C:** Joel Embiid, Richaun Holmes, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor  For argument's sake, imagine they use the OKC and Miami picks to draft even Caris LeVert and Malik Beasley.   That gives them a starting lineup of Simmons, LeVert, Covington, Grant, Embiid. You only really need to keep one of Wood/Saric and one of Holmes/Noel/Okafor then.   The next part which would have made things *really* interesting is if they take Tatum instead of Fultz in 2017. That gives them a rotation of:   Simmons, LeVert, Tatum, Grant, Embiid with a bench including Beasley, Covington, Wood/Saric and Holmes/Noel.   Then who knows what you could get in a trade with the other one of Wood/Saric, Holmes/Noel/Okafor and all their future picks."
"I think that's s disingenuous way of ranking them. First of all, if you are going to shit on teams for bad drafting, Cleveland had the #1 pick 2 years in a row and took Wiggins and Anthony Bennet. THAT is putrid drafting.   I agree that Boston and the Lakers did well in the draft, I think they are probably the two most talented front offices in the league.  So really you are bring rough on the 76ers for drafting Okafor and Fultz when they turned out to be busts. But there are a lot of other busts in the draft as well. Not every pick can be a winner. I think a 50% hit rate is acceptable and as others have said, Hinkie also picked up a lot of other players with lower draft picks who are now recognised as being the sorts of key role players on championship teams that you want to have. Robert Covington etc etc.  &gt; And they have the two worst busts up there.  Anthony Bennet as a #1 pick is criminal. Minnesota took Derrick Williams 2nd in '11. The Bucks took Jabari Parker 2nd in '14."
"I really liked when Robert Covington and Saric were on the team.  I believe the entire process was designed to develop a perennial contender, but everything seemed rushed."
"It’ll be someone you never expect,  Robert Covington gonna steal it away"
Robert Covington
"Vuc has very good shot contest rate. He doesnt rack up blocks but is a Steven Adams level deterrent.   Williams and Ball are both situated perfectly. Ball/Caruso are statistically excellent point of attach defenders and Pat Williams looks like he can become a Robert Covington like forward who is versatile both on and off the ball on defense.    2 great defenders, 1 solid rim presence  and then you have your two you can hide--- just like every team has to hide someone or another.    DeRozan will be subbed for Caruso a lot, but its not much worse than any other team imo. We also had much worse players and athletes last year playing guys like Lauri and Denzel Valentine and Billy Donovan still ended up with a top 10 defense rating"
"What's more liquid, a 2nd round pick and cap fillers or Ben Simmons?  If some one like Robert Covington becomes available, what's more likely for sixers to get him? Ben Simmons or 2nd round pick and cap fillers? Even after trading Ben, sixers are not able to sign any one. A Ben Simmons is still easier to trade, including in a multi team, to get sixers what they'd want than 2nd round pick and cap fillers."
PG - Lonzo Ball - $1  SG - Luka - $5  SF - Robert covington - $1  PF - Giannis - $5  C - Ayton - $3
"If a player gets criticized for not having a ring, it means they're one of the greatest players of all time. Nobody gives a shit that Robert Covington doesn't have a ring.  In order to be one of the *greatest* greatest players of all time, you do need to win championships."
Kevin Durant  Luka Doncic  Rudy Gobert  Robert Covington  Brook Lopez  i.e. Luka with a 7-footer who can actually shoot
PG - Luka Doncic $5  SG - Gary Trent Jr. $1  SF - Giannis $5  PF - Robert Covington $1  C - Deandre Ayton $3
PG: Lonzo Ball $1  SG: Devin Booker $4  SF: Robert Covington $1  PF: Giannis Antetokoumpo $5  C: Karl-Anthony Towns $4
"The best role players are plus defenders and can shoot the three when fed by the stars. Tucker did that with Harden at an insanely high level for years in Houston. Even at his current age, I am still putting him on my list. Mikal bridges looks to be one of the up and coming 3nD studs. Marcus smart is an elite defender, and honestly I’ll take his questionable shot selection because his defense simply makes up for it. Robert Covington needs to re-find his shot, but he is also the right archetype. Finally, I’m going to cheat a little and say OG Anunoby. Idk how much longer we will consider him a role player, but he is about as good as it gets for 3nD."
I feel like half of the guys probably did but just don’t get asked about it  Off the top of my head I bet someone like Robert Covington just got it when it was available like a normal person and didn’t need a room full of doctors to make the decision
markelle fultz -&gt; james harden   jalen suggs -&gt; jason kidd  chuma okeke -&gt; robert covington  jonathan isaac -&gt; rashard lewis  wendell carter jr -&gt; al horford    cole anthony -&gt; mo williams  rj hampton -&gt; dante exum  terrence ross -&gt; eddie jones  franz wagner -&gt; mike dunleavy jr  mo bamba -&gt; rudy gobert  thats pretty damn good
"I dont blame Ben for wanting out at all, the 76ers front office has been awful since he got drafted. Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges and Markelle Fultz are 3 players that are perfect for the team but they traded RoCo and other trade pieces for 1 year of Jimmy Butler (who eventually turned into Seth Curry who i love but id prefer RoCo if i had the choice). Mikal Bridges move completely baffled me and the Fultz situation disgusted me by how the front office acted.   Add all of that ontop of the fact that both their coaches have been subpar (Brett Brown seemed like a nice guy but had some severe mental lapses as a coach) and Doc Rivers... it just seems like he doesnt have people skills, what he said at that interview and the interviews after that is just a joke, and if thats what is being said publicly, whats being said behind closed doors and at practice. I dont blame Ben for not shooting or being aggressive if that's how little confidence his coach has in him.  AND add all the trade rumors hes been dealing with and its all a disaster waiting to happen.  Now saying all that im not saying Ben is blameless, if he ever wants to be a Super Star player he has to change his mind set, he has to hold himself accountable and take initiative. He has all the skills but he doesnt have the mentality to be great, at least not yet. But the amount of criticism he gets is completely disproportionate to the amount of blame he holds."
Those are running two bigs in the traditional mold.  I do think that the future for both of those players is to be playing with another small forward like Robert Covington in the front court rather than a traditional center.  Both players are athletic enough to defend perimeter players (they are just awesome enough to also be shot blockers).
"Yeah and Harden wasn't traded at the deadline specifically because Houston tried to wait and it didn't work out. They had to bail out early to salvage the situation.  They didn't get any of the packages they were holding out for and settled for a package that was no better than what they already had on the table during the offseason.  Jimmy Butler was another player Minnesota tried the waiting game with and it didn't work. They didn't end up lasting until the deadline either and had to settle for less than they were hoping for.  Minnesota waited and they got: Dario Saric, Robert Covington and a 2nd round pick.   Doesnt sound like a great couple of examples.   All it shows is that Philadelphia is going to put on a brave face, get the shit kicked out of them and then settle pretty quickly for a package no better than what's already on the table.  By comparison, I could point put the Paul George trades, Westbrook trade, Anthony Davis trade, etc etc.   All cases of offseason trades where the teams actually got returns they were pretty happy with.  &gt;Tobias  Was an expiring non-star you guys picked up cheap because his old franchise didn't want to pay him what he was about to demand.  &gt;but let's not act like big deals don't go down in season  The best time to trade him is already in your rear view mirror. The trade deadline is a buyer's market not a seller's market.  Let's not pretend like your situation is going to improve by waiting for a worse time to sell your star.  You said the best time to trade him was at the deadline. Then you provided a couple bad examples and changed your tune to ""well at least some trades happen during the season"".  &gt;the trade deadline is historically the best time to sell  Lol"
"Not sure who's comparing Nesmith to Klay, the most complimentary comp I've seen for him is Robert Covington tbh"
Its that easy. Why don't they just go to the 3&amp;D wing store and just pick one up?  I heard if you buy a Jae Crowder you get a Robert Covington 50% off.
"Yeah you know my blazers are struggling atm, I think we should upgrade Robert Covington for Giannis.  I think it'd realistically make us better"
"What people thought Robert Covington was at one point is exactly what Jae Crowder is, so give me Jae"
"shiiiiiit, I've got a team full of those dudes already.  I'd rather the Wiz trade for like Terrence Ross, Thad Young, Eric Gordon or fucking TJ Warren at the deadline than send him to Portland for a partially washed Robert Covington."
"Very analogous situation to Robert Covington on the Process 76ers. Absolute gem of a draft pick and a ridiculous contract to boot. He'll get paid though, no worries."
"They had Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington and Jerami Grant so yes probably. Also an unproven Richaun Holmes coming off the bench!"
"Barkley is my favorite ex Sixer.    Some of my other favorite ex Sixers in terms of playing is Wilt Chamberlain,  Robert Covington,  Dr. J but I dig Charles in terms of his skills and his infinite basketball wisdom.   I love how he speaks his mind."
Robert Covington?  Eric Gordon?  God bless the small ball rockets
"I remember the hype behind a potential D’Lo for Aaron Gordon or Robert Covington trade.   Back then a lot of people wanted the Warriors to take Covington instead of Wiggins lol, in hindsight that sounds disgustingly bad considering the Warriors were going to be over the cap either way."
"I wonder if banishing Bagley to the G-league would do anything. Obviously, it would deplete his already minimum trade value, but at least he would get some playing time with lesser competition to work on his craft (if that is a thing he does).  Kings' cap space is limited too. It's difficult to see how they can wiggle to get some second-round picks from absorbing bad contracts. It'd be nice to just take a bunch of stabs at future draft picks and undrafted guys and see what sticks. Considering the gradual increase in talent across the league (almost to the point of expansion), surely there must be some hidden gems just waiting to be given minutes, kind of like TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, and even Richaun Holmes."
"Here are some of the Sixers process era players that weren't considered NBA players (by a long shot, in some cases) at the time..  * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Jerami Grant * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * Ish Smith  All of these guys went from being essentially G-Leaguers to contributing players.  Brett Brown isn't the guy that's going to lead you to a championship, but he's one of the best at getting lower tier players to improve and play hard.  I'd argue that due to his unique experience coaching one of the worst teams of all time, he's one of the most qualified of this particular situation."

"Bingo! I wish more of our fans understood that.   Got people pointing at what Garbua is doing w/ RGV and saying he should've got minutes with the Rockets and, no, that's now how that works *at all*. JC really needs to be sent down to RGV to get minutes at that speed for a season or so, then see how he looks getting rotational minutes with the Rockets.  Sengun was the Turkish league MVP - dude is ready for NBA minutes. Garuba is close, but I personally think he needs to marinade w/ RGV for their season. Christopher is incredibly rough around the edges, but he's the exact type of dude that seems like he just needs some minutes at the G-League level to smooth his game out.  Hartenstein, K.J. Martin, KPJ, Gary Payton II, Montrezl Harrell, Clint Capela, Robert Covington - all those dudes put in minutes with RGV and are starting or getting significant minutes off the bench. Still makes me mad we let GP2 go to the Warriors - he was something special with RGV, all 3 times he was with us lol"
"People often begin to overvalue certain players, often role players, the longer they don’t play because the idea of them is often better than the actual player.   It’s always funny to see how many players go from untouchable to kind of meh between 1 month before the season to 1 month into the season.   For example, Robert Covington is one of my favorite players but his value is much higher when you’re thinking about him rather than watching him."
"Go look at the roster of those teams and try to figure out why.   In fact, heres a reminder of what the Wolves traded an All NBA talent for....Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick.   2 rotation players... one of which had a major injury that year, and the other that didn't even wanna be in Minnesota and played like it. One guy thats not in the league anymore and a 2nd round pick...   Shouldn't be rocket science around here that when you take an All NBA talent off the team and replace it with bench guys, the team gets worse. Also, the last two seasons have been Towns' worst when it comes to injuries. So shouldn't exactly be shocking the Wolves have missed the playoffs since Jimmy left."
dude robert covington
Robert Covington.
perfect role player. this is what people though Robert Covington was
"Lakers and Wizards Ariza in early years was actually doing some off the dribble stuff, he was not a stiff with ball handling like Danny Green or Robert Covington or PJ Tucker…  I mean at least the Ariza comp is like a low ceiling. Another ceiling comp is maybe Gordon Hayward? Hayward does have a better mid range and off the dribble shooting that maybe Franz can develop those one day"
Magic shaq is quick asf. I think he would basically be a giannas or taller zion. The game changes base off generational players.   Shaq is one of the main reasons people started shooting jumpshots and not wanting to play center.   Defense just make him a on the best help defenders. Play a zone defense.   A modern day shaq team would be like.   Lonzo-  zach lavine - Robert covington-  Marcus Morris- Shaq   Ricky rubio- Paul George- Harrison Barnes- Bobby Portis- Shaq   Last Deaaron fox- Duncan Robinson- kawhi- joe ingles- Shaq
"It's tough to say for sure right now, between the small sample size, how injured we've been, and how just straight-up unpredictable the East has been thus far.  Assuming health on both sides, I'd personally like our odds against the Bulls. Vuc scares me and I think overall they'd definitely put up a fight (especially if they get hot out on the perimeter). That said, any matchup with us comes down to the simple question of that team either having someone(s) that can slow down Giannis or having the offensive firepower to be ok with him going off. I don't think they have anyone that comes close to managing the first, but they definitely have a chance at doing the second. It really comes down to how well Vuc and DeRozan play, IMO - LaVine's going to draw Jrue all series I'd imagine, and while Lonzo and Caruso are really good at contributing to a good offense, they aren't the types that are going to carry your offense themselves.   If they're looking to be in good position come trade deadline time, I think the best thing they could do would be to try to get a good help defender that can play minutes at the 4 and 5. I think someone like Thad Young or Robert Covington might make sense there (not accounting for the cap - dunno their contracts and what the Bulls could realistically afford to move), as they'd both help and might realistically be available."
"I think this is the ideal lineup:   PG: Jrue Holiday   SG: Jimmy Butler   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Jerami Grant    C: Dwight Howard   That team is filthy defensively, then you have a bench of Horford, Wood, Holmes, McConnell, Fultz, Ish Smith, and George Hill. If we're ranking off of talent alone, Hill/Horford/Wood arguably have higher peaks than Jerami Grant, but Grant is needed to fix that very tenuous spacing, plus he's a more versatile defender who fits alongside Dwight."
They did the same thing with Robert Covington.
"It's crazy that he was ranked 82nd by espn at one point. Robert Covington, Davis Bertans, and Eric Bledsoe are some of the players ranked significantly higher than him."
"We're starting to get into semantics because some people would consider players like, say Robert Covington, a role player while others consider him a good player or both.   So I'll say this to be clear: my opinion is we have Ben Simmons so we shouldn't trade him for anyone worse or who would be worse for this team. If Morey decides a player is better for the Sixers than Ben even though the player may not be as good then I'm fine with that. But I'm not taking a player or players that are definitely neither better for the Sixers or better than Ben. Because the baseline isn't nothing, it's Ben. We have Ben for four more years.   I hate that that shit happened and said it would be a problem (and got heavily criticized for it) but we're here now. Just gotta move forward when and if he is ready. But that doesn't change the reality or our goal."
&gt;Every year. D-Lo lead the Nets to an eastern conference playoff  Well KAT's in the west.   And the 2nd best teammate he's had in his 7 year career is arguably Robert Covington.
"I've been open to trading either of Turner or Sabonis for ages - the issue is though that if we traded either, we'd be looking for a defensive-minded stretch-4 back and those players are about as rare as someone with Turner's skillset. We got close apparently with the Gordon Hayward S&amp;T.  Here's a list of forwards I'd think be a great fit next to Sabonis - pretty much none of them are available:  Johnathan Issac, Marcus Morris, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith, Aaron Gordon, Robert Covington  PJ Washington is about the only player I could see a realistic trade for.  We'd have to be high on PJ (I am, I don't know if many others are). For what it's worth, Miles Bridges erupting to start the season has made him more expendable. Apparently Charlotte's tried a few times to offer PJ and a 1st for Turner and I think that's a realistic return.  I'd also like Harrison Barnes, but he's on a hot-streak right now."

worked well for Robert Covington in Philly as well.  In a standard team/offense he probably wouldn't even have made a roster at the time and ended up as a top level 3nD guy for a while.

I don't think that was unreasonable for Barnes. Robert Covington went for two firsts to Portland (#16 in 2020 and #23 in 2021).  What I probably would have done was a 1st and one of either Nesmith or Langford.
Lambchops are you off the Hawks bandwagon now?  Also I don't think that was unreasonable for Barnes. Robert Covington went for two firsts to Portland.  What I probably would have done was a 1st and one of either Nesmith or Langford.

"*Definitely* Thybulle. His athleticism is a godsend. He dunks everything in the fastbreak, and I've seen Robert Covington (who I love) miss too many layups to take that for granted."
"&gt; Well one year Curry was hurt for damn near all of it so that was gonna be down the drain  Sure. But I feel like it was still a bad idea to surrender before that even happened. And in hindsight, surrendering in 2020-21 is looking like a terrible idea, they would've been right up there with the Suns if they cared about winning, and would've had a chance to make the Finals.   &gt; Also the whole premise revolves around a Robert Covington trade which we don’t even know was a realistic possibility  Covington is frequently traded for 1-2 first round picks. If not Covington they'd get someone else. He's just a placeholder.   &gt; but you’re so far over the cap anyway that it doesn’t even matter to anything besides luxury tax  But it does matter. The crazy luxury tax subtly matters for every move they make. For example they didn't use the MLE this year."
"Robert Covington.  Financially that’s the better move. No one is gonna want to pay 40M for those 2 guys, they’re not worth it. Not even close.  Covington if used correctly moves the needle and is a solid rotation piece.  You’re still paying Wiggins too much for what he does and a project lottery pick does not makeup for it if you’re a championship contender.  Also most teams would not be able to afford wiggins either."
" As a Warriors fan, Wiggins and Kuminga.  Everyone keeps talking about how Warriors need to make win now moves. What win now moves can we make? Adding Robert Covington isnt a win now move lol. The smart move will be to keep Poole, Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman.  Steph at 36 will still be playing at a high level. Alongside a 33 yo Klay and Draymond (assuming he re signs for cheap), they will be playing with a 5th year Poole, 4th year Wiseman, 3rd year Kuminga and 3rd year Moody. This team will be deeper than the Pacific Ocean"
Well one year Curry was hurt for damn near all of it so that was gonna be down the drain. Year after that was just weird and the world was in chaos. And can we get a few years in before we start judging Kuminga’s value lol. Also the whole premise revolves around a Robert Covington trade which we don’t even know was a realistic possibility. Personally I like the value of Wiggins and Kuminga more and yes that Wiggins contract is brutal but you’re so far over the cap anyway that it doesn’t even matter to anything besides luxury tax
The Robert Covington game
"&gt;What are you talking about? Harden was carrying a terrible squad. Who was his second best player? Eric Gordon? Third best was Robert Covington? I mean the Rockets needed Danuel House to be a major contributor. Every single play had to be run through Harden.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;What happened to Lebron last year with AD out? I have no idea what your argument here is. When teams are built a certain way, one star is usually not enough. The Thunder were also a great defensive team with literally the best Harden stopper in the NBA.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Westbrook is terrible. Harden was playing with a very limited roster that was built with the assumption there are two ball dominant creators.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;You were right about the Capela timeline though. I remember he was out but the plantar fascia stuff only came out post trade."
"yes, i did see that video where derrick rose finds out he’s traded while standing in front of his mansion and next to his luxury car  he’s free to retire in stay in chicago  i also find it funny how D Rose getting treated like this is unconscionable, but somebody like Robert Covington or Jae Crowder just has to deal with it bc they are role players and should just be happy to have a spot"
"Horrible take isolating a small start of the season sample and ignoring Tatum's entire body of work. The casuals really love looking at small samples and then creating very weird opinions based on them though so it's not too surprising to see the masses support this opinion. Tatum is going through the same cold stretch as Lillard but you don't see people like Robert Covington calling him out lmao. Smart needs to know his place in the league, he's a defender first and an offensive contributor second. Without guys like Tatum he wouldn't score half as much as he does."
"Because talent around the league see's how much of a ballhog he is, they don't want to join voluntarily. I had to drop Robert Covington on fantasy because he barely gets any touches because Dame always chucking smh"
"And he's not even a great individual defender, more of a team help defender. He's much more Robert Covington than Ben Simmons."
&gt;gave two middle fingers as he forced his way to BKN  I love how you feel it's your prerogative to tell Rockets fans how to feel about Harden leaving. Newsflash: Our owner is a penny-pinching scumbag who didn't commit to maximizing the prime of one of his franchise's Top 3 ever players. Tell me how he's meant to feel about an owner that salary dumped Robert Covington. The guy is still a proud part-owner of our women's soccer team and has returned to the city multiple times to interact with the community.
Embiid had a way better cast once and they played less than 20 games together. I don't think it's fair to say Robert Covington and Dario Saric as your 3rd and 4th best players is a much better cast than those best Pelican teams.
"Yeah I definitely agree. I also think there’s a lot of guys who are so good at their role that I value them more than a lower impact young guy putting up good numbers on a bad team.   I think having guys like Kyle Anderson, Jarrett Allen, Joe Ingles, Robert Covington helps teams win more than Garland. Ingles is a pretty egregious omission from this list imo."
We won’t have much cap space but mainly 3 and D Robert Covington types would be nice
"TJ McConnell, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Dario Saric. Those were process guys, not first round picks, but second rounders/undrafted/gleague players/eurostash never coming over players. And they're each putting in work somewhere and earning good minutes. The only reason Silver intervened was because we weren't a small market, we were a big market and we blew up an 8 seed roster which had failure after failure and no obvious way forward to contention, it took us 5 years to go from mediocre to 1 seed. I'd fucking do it again in a heartbeat if we ever got back to that 8-10 seed mediocrity."
"The 2015 Sixer who won 10 games included solid NBA players who without the Process to give them a chance may never have gotten a chance to develop into the players they are now.  This includes TJ McConnell, Jerami Grant, Robert Covington, and Richaun Holmes all of whom are solid role players still even though none of them are stars."
MVP: Damian Lillard  DPOY: Robert Covington  MIP: Carmelo Anthony   6th Man: Anfernee Simons  ROTY: CJ Elleby  COTY: N/A
"Danny Green is a catch and shoot guy who makes 15 mill, Robert Covington is strictly a catch and shoot guy who makes 12 mill.   12 mill is good value for Caruso imo but yes obviously you have to be a contending with other high level players to get the best value from him."
We need a 3 and D swingman to complement our good backcourt and good interior presence. A player like Robert Covington would be perfect but there's no world where we'd just get him lol
"I feel for Wall. The fact that he was acquired with a 2nd round pick lets you know the whole story. Houston were hedging their bets on a rebuild after the Morey/D'Antoni era had ended, but were still hoping Harden would stay.  Alas Robert Covington is traded for a pick and Harden soon follows. Eric Gordon is mysteriously shut down and PJ Tucker is traded to the Bucks.   Wall is now on a team that would much prefer to develop guys like Tate, Wood, KPJ, Brown through the losses. Guys that are delayed by the presence of a ball dominant star like Wall.  The only answer is to buy him out. I can't see a contender taking on his contract or a rebuilding team requiring his minutes. And buying him out does right by his good character he's displayed during the transition."
"ah yes. guys like jerami grant, robert covington, tj mcconnell sure did lose out being in philly"
"He absolutely focused on project players. TJ McConnell, Richaun Holmes, Robert Covington, Christian Wood, Jakarr Sampson have all signed multiple NBA contracts after being given the chance in Philly.   Most of those guys wouldn’t have gotten a shot in the league otherwise"
