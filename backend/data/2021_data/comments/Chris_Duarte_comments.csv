"Alperen Sengun is a probable lotto pick no one has heard of, but he could a beast in this league. Usman Garuba could go in the lotto too, and he’s been amazing in Spain.    Daishen Nix, Jared Butler, Scottie Barnes and Chris Duarte will be the steals of this draft. But it’s filled with talent from top to bottom."

"Chris Duarte, future superstar MVP*"
"Chris Duarte, drafted in 2021, is a year older than him"
I heard Chris Duarte is also a really good at baseball.. idk much about baseball but I’d like to see Pat and Chris touch each other bases sometime
"Seeing as we just got Rick Carlisle back in town as our head coach, we’re in win now mode. We just drafted a 24 year old, Chris Duarte, who looks like he can also play solid rotational minutes.   We had a lot of pieces last year too, but we couldn’t stay healthy. It also didn’t help that we had a pitiful coach who’s defensive scheme consisted of going over on every screen no matter if the player shot like Simmons or Dame.  We had to deal with Oladipo not wanting to be apart of our squad too. Thankfully we turned him into Lavert.   There was a lot going on last year.  I’m not saying we’re a huge contender, but we’re now  a lot more of a step in the right direction."
"I mean we’ve done that once in the last few seasons, this year. You can argue that he won’t be better than all the players picked behind him, but you really can’t know that until we actually see them all play and he seems to fit with the FO’s current timeline pretty well. We have by no means drafted well, but we’ve had 4 top 15 picks in the past 12 years. Those picks were Paul George, a trade for George Hill, Myles Turner, and Chris Duarte. I wouldn’t say that’s particularly bad."
We are destined for eternal mediocrity...  That is until we drafted future first ballot HOF Chris Duarte who will lead us to the promised land
"What bothers me is their draft picks in the mid first. It seems like they play it so safe. There is a path to contention without tanking for them but you have to be willing to take big swings in the draft. Example: Chris Duarte will be good for them, but at age 24 he doesn’t have much room for growth. It was an extremely safe pick. Look at some of the other small market teams who are contending without tanking, they always hit on a star mid-late in the draft and while that’s hard, it doesn’t happen if you consistently draft the highest floor guy."
The disrespect to our lord and savior Chris Duarte
"Elusive 7th pick. 7th pick only works charm for the Warriors.  13th pick. Use this pick to draft a shooting guard and you have yourself an allstar at best. Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell and Chris Duarte"

Chris Duarte
Chris Duarte older than my dad
No fucking Chris Duarte highlights tho smh  HoH is garbage
Chris Duarte
Dude is a capable shooter and only 22. Chris Duarte was just drafted at 24 in the 1st round by the Pacers. He will get signed somewhere that's for sure.
Chris Duarte is going to avg 25 for the pacers and we are a top 4 seed in the east
"5x5 watch: With about 5 minutes remaining, Chris Duarte has 19/3/6/4/4 vs Portland.   7/15 shooting (3/8 3PT, 2/2 FT) and +29 at this point in the game."
"Always partial to the Pacers:  TJ McConnell, Chris Duarte, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, OShae Brissett"
Duarte also got stepped on by a hawk on a buzzer beater and didn't get a call so I don't really know what to make of summer league reffing.  Edit: https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/chris-duarte-buzzer-beater-vs-001400977.html
"Caught this one from Chris Duarte a few days ago  https://youtu.be/3deQtclfxTY?t=114  They didn't call it, but he still made the buzzer beating shot (and it looks like he was expecting the call after)"
"Think of it this way he’s younger than Chris Duarte Obi Toppin, Cory Kispert, etc. There’s still a lot of upside with him, and he’s already a productive player as is.  If he doesn’t improve its basically the going rate for a sharpshooter anyways. But if he makes a jump it’s a steal"
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than the following 2021 1st round draft picks:  * Davion Mitchell * Chris Duarte * Corey Kispert
Brandon Ingram (2016 draft) is younger than Chris Duarte.
Thing is Chris Duarte is Dominican… and if I know my people.. that birth certificate might be a little sus lol  I would say he’s either 37 or 16.
Chris Duarte could be their father
It's gonna come out that he's younger than Chris Duarte.
Chris Duarte to the Lakers???
Eric Paschall is the same age as Devin Booker and Chris Duarte.
He’s the same age as Chris Duarte. I think he has time to improve.
True but the 13th pick makes like 3 mill/yr on his rookie contract.  THT was a mid-second round pick and really hasn't done anything meaningful in the NBA as an individual yet if we're being honest.  Not necessarily saying 10.6 mill/yr is astronomically high but idk how Chris Duarte matters.
Something wild to think about: Exum is only 8 months older than Cam Johnson and only 2 years older than Chris Duarte.
I definitely like your young guys from the draft in Chris Duarte who is a nice large guard and Isaiah Jackson who can translate into a pretty good defender in the front court. Hopefully Warren comes back healthy too
What? He's twenty. He's three years younger than Chris Duarte.
"Its unlikely but if KAT, Chris Duarte, and Montero (projected lottery pick in 2022) play in 2024 in the qualifiers, Dominican Republic could make it. The real answer is Embiid - the road for Cameroon is significantly harder and with Embiid’s health, its unlikely he ever is allowed to play intl basketball by Philly"
Chris Duarte for MVP
It finally happened to me this year when I realized I'm almost a year older than Chris Duarte. It feels weird when the oldest guy in the draft is still younger than you.
"Yes it was. Chris Duarte will always be older than Josh Primo, regardless of how long of a career he has. The literal reading of it makes no sense."
or it could be Chris Duarte
Chris Duarte is older than Bam Adebayo
Who the hell is Chris Duarte?
Interesting fact. Josh Primo's mom graduated HS the same year as Chris Duarte.
So Chris Duarte = GOAT?
He’s actually chris duarte
"No, it’s a bad pick because they already have the back court of the future in Fox and Hali.. there are still better prospects at the wing and forwards like Zhaire Williams, Moses Moody, Chris Duarte and big like Kai Jones or Alperen Sengun on the board..  Davion is not gonna be effective next to Fox and Hali and that is just not gonna help the Kings nor Davion develop anything"
"idk, maybe it was just smokescreen, but i don't think so. We really wanted Chris Duarte, and were trying to trade up for him"
Chris Duarte?
"It looks like Taj was 24 years and 1 day old when he was drafted in 2009, and Chris Duarte is 24 years and 45 days old."
"The Pacers picked Duarte to get the rights to Chris Duarte Jr in 15 years. Playing the long game, I love it!"
Warriors got a good draft. End of discussion   It’s a matter of those picks work out for them but Kuminga and Moody are lovely for any team at 7 and 14 really  Alternatively you could wonder what if they got Franz Wagner and Chris Duarte instead but ehh
Chris Duarte is a hooper
Chris Duarte is fantastic here
Chris Duarte gets the senior citizen next year smh
Chris Duarte is 6 years older than Josh Primo
Chris Duarte is older than Deaaron fox lmfao
Just here to see people’s comments about my boy Chris Duarte in a few picks. Hope the best for him.    Side note: he is suited and booted tonight with his kid
Someone nba ready so either trey murphy or chris duarte

"At this point, I don't believe Beal is going anywhere anytime soon. Chris Duarte has long been rumored to Washington at 15, and if he's there on the table, he seems like the pick."
Chris Duarte  10000x All Star after receiving the immortality chip in 2047
Chris Duarte will be a top 10 player in this draft
"Fun Fact: At the end of his rookie contract, Chris Duarte will retire and transition to an assistant role"
I would love Chris Duarte here but if we move the pick again fuck it let’s see who we can get
"One name that seems to keep popping up is Oregon’s Chris Duarte, who I don’t think drops past 14 or 15. Considering our cap situation, Pelinka may see Duarte as a rare opportunity to get some value for money. Who knows which reports to believe though."
1. Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons)  2. Jalen Green (Houston Rockets)  3. Evan Mobley (Cleveland Cavaliers)  4. Jalen Suggs (Toronto Raptors)  5. Scottie Barnes (Orlando Magic) 6. James Bouknight (Oklahoma City Thunder)  7. Jonathan Kuminga (Golden State Warriors) 8. Moses Moody (Orlando Magic) 9. Franz Wagner (Sacramento Kings)  10. Josh Giddey (Memphis Grizzlies)  11.

Josh Christopher (Utah Jazz)   I got bored at work and decided to take a stab at the first round.
Chris Duarte?
"In the worst-case scenario in which they have to use their picks they can get some really solid bench depth that they're hurting for.   Davion Mitchell at 7 seems solid, especially considering their bench PG is *checks notes* Nico Mannion.  At 14 I'd go for a roleplayer wing - Chris Duarte, Moses Moody or Trey Murphy.   PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole / Damion Lee   SF: Wiggins / #14 / Kent Bazemore  PF: Draymond / Juan Toscano  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid lineup in the West. Obviously it depends on the big 3 playing out of their minds to get deep into the playoffs but the talent is there."
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
"&gt;I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.  So, the ""SnT Schoeder for Lonzo and fill out with good vets"" method, ala the 2020 run.  Do you think Pelicans accept that offer?"
"I don’t want Russ bc that means no depth. He isn’t bad, he’s just a bad fit for the Lakers since Lakers need 3PT shooting.   I would love for Lonzo to be S&amp;T for Schröder and probably Gasol. For Kuzma and Trez to be shipped. Caruso and THT resigned. Melo to be signed with vet min. Gorgui Dieng and someone like Dewayne Dedmon to be signed as vet mins. Then fill remaining roster with players from last year on vet mins. Oh yeah, keep the #22 pick and sign Trey Murphy III, Chris Duarte, or Jaden Springer.   Best possible scenario I can think of.  Lonzo KCP LeBron AD Dieng during regular season.   Lonzo KCP THT LeBron AD during playoffs if THT makes a huge leap."
Chris Duarte (2021) is older than Brandon Ingram (2016)

Everyone's sleeping on Chris Duarte
"There was a kid from my town who was almost literally always at the park playing/shooting around. Every single time I went to hoop he was there, either playing in a game or training by himself. He was a quality player on varsity, never played college.     If you really want to make it happen, you just have to keep working at it. Tell your coach you are 100% serious about getting as far as you can. Even if you don't make the NBA, you can make a living playing the game overseas. Make a game tape of yourself and send it to college coaches. Aim for something reasonable. Instead of Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, consider the small D1 or even NAIA schools. Look up players like Chris Duarte and see what road they took."
"He can create. He won SEC freshman of the year, and made first team. He lead his own team in scoring. He is an overall player than just a pure scorer or shooter.   But he is totally okay with deferring to the top scorer on the team. The main thing is that he is 19, and so it’s hard to say what his ceiling is.   I get it though, bias aside, he isn’t showing star potential. Still, Davion Mitchell, Chris Duarte and Wagner went ahead of him, who, imo, have just as many question marks."
"""Ka-ching"" is the sound I'll make when I cash out on my Chris Duarte rookie of the year bet"
Chris Duarte.
"Trading Wall will be next to impossible...but who says no?  PHI gets:  John Wall, Caris Lavert, TJ Warren, Chris Duarte, and picks from HOU  HOU gets: Kristaps Porzingis   DAL gets: Tobias Harris   IND gets: Ben Simmons"
Pacers must have known when drafting Chris Duarte to help fill some minutes.
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
Chris Duarte
When the answer is clearly Oshae Brissett or Chris Duarte
Malcolm Brogdon  Chris Duarte  Justin Holiday  Domantas Sabonis  Myles Turner  T.J. McConnell  Goga Bitadze  Oshae Brissett  Jeremy Lamb  Torrey Craig  Isaiah Jackson  Brad Wanamaker  Caris LeVert  DeJon Jarreau  T.J. Warren
The Chris Duarte/Scottie Barnes rookie battle everyone was hyped up about pre season goes down in about 4 hours.
"&gt; Analysts: ""Wow, they really should have drafted player A!""        I haven’t seen anyone say this about Chris Duarte, have you?"
Chris Duarte is also good… and he is 13th pick
Chris Duarte does
I hope Indiana is ready for the Chris Duarte era
Who's your way-too-early all-rookie team? I got   Chris Duarte / Jalen Green / Josh Giddey / Scottie Barnes / Evan Mobley
I'd go   evan mobley   scottie barnes  jalen green  chris duarte  josh giddey
Who is this Chris Duarte guy
Dude is a walking bucket.  Also not to mention Josh Giddey and Chris Duarte from this class as well. You love to see it.
&gt;The best deals available right now will still be available then  The world doesn't wait for the 76ers. At one point Brodgon + pick #13 were on the table. Now the Pacers re-signed Brogdon and are happy to have Chris Duarte. The deal isn't coming back anytime soon.

Scottie Barnes has removed Chris Duarte from the ROTY chat

Chris Duarte has entered the chat
Chris Duarte.
Chris Duarte is a rookie playing his 3rd game but he's allowed to take so many shots. Every player needs Coach Rick as their coach
Where is Chris Duarte from?
Chris Duarte is going to be a serious RoY candidate. His odds dropped from +3500 to +1200 last I checked.
"Chris Duarte is the next Klay, Davion Mitchell is the next Dort, Scottie Barnes is the next KD, Cade is injury prone, and Zion is an ice cream truck."
chris duarte roy
chris duarte because hes a god rn
"chris duarte actually looks really good. if those reports of the warriors wanting to trade for him were true, i can see why"
Yes because when he was drafted he was considered a project and a player that would take a few years before contributing. Someone like Chris Duarte had a much higher probability of winning ROY even though he was drafted 13th because he’s ready to play now.
"last night, chris duarte  two nights from now, jalen suggs"
"Chris Duarte, I've heard so much about you"
Let's go Pacers!!! Anxious to see how Chris Duarte follows up his 27 point debut.
"Chris Duarte is going to have the best season of all the rookies this year.   Domantas Sabonis is going to be an All Star for his 3rd year in a row.   LaMelo Ball is the best Ball brother, and it's not particularly close. He legitimately may be an all star this year.   I would fake an injury if I was ever tasked with guarding Steph Curry  Russ simply will not work with the Lakers. I don't like Dennis and they shouldn't have paid him his 80 mil, but Russ is a downgrade considering his contract."
"3 observations and potential overreactions from last nights Hornets/Pacers game:  1) Melo is for real  2) If Sabonis keeps hitting 3s, he is going to be SCARY  3) Chris Duarte OROY"
Chris Duarte with his career average of 27ppg
Chris Duarte is gonna win ROTY. At least in the buzz. I watched Jalen Green and he's raw af. Duarte is so smooth off the dribble and catch. He honestly should replace Levert
"I hope Chris Duarte wins ROTY, or at least continues a similar level of play."
He's no Chris Duarte
Who the fuck is Chris Duarte
"I know people joke.   But legit.   Chris Duarte might be the oldest guy to ever win the rookie of the year, IF HE WINS  I believe Brogden was also 24 when he won. But I think Chris might be more months older, when he wins."
"Thats cool and all but..CHris Duarte, my beloved"
Chris “Lightskin Donavan” Duarte
ahead of GOAT chris duarte?
damn why they snub Chris Duarte
Should Chris Duarte be in the MVP conversation?
Holy shit Chris Duarte is having himself a great start
Being 24: Chris Duarte
Chris Duarte will be ROY and Isaiah Jackson will be the steal of the draft. Think I'm being biased? Well I am. Blow me.
Chris Duarte will be first team. Dude has looked legit so far. Plus he will get the playing time with Warren and LeVert being out
"I, like many Pacers fans at the time, really wondered why we selected Chris Duarte over Moses Moody on draft night. But Duarte has been really impressive over summer league and preseason. Can’t wait to watch this guy get better!"
"Chris Duarte IMO is the most NBA ready. Smooth scorer. I might even take him over Levert cause of his injury history and looming FA.   Giddey, Davion and Scottie are stand outs too."
It is if you're 24 and named Chris Duarte
Northwest Florida State College - Either u/gontrohyt or Chris Duarte
Are you dumb? I said Chris Duarte was a bad draft pick because he is already 24 years old. Why are you talking about Luka. Luka was a good draft pick.
Warriors wanted Chris Duarte sooooo bad but he got picked right before they were up next.
"Chris Duarte on the Pacers is going to be great this year. Going to get a ton of playing time on a decent(ish) team, in Rick Carlisle system"
"He's 23, younger than Chris Duarte and the same age as Davion Mitchell..."
Chris Duarte MVP season incoming
"Chris Duarte - main comments/attention about him around the draft was his age, but the guy can really play, and is going to get a lot of minutes on a decent (ish) Pacers team"
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.

"Chris Duarte might be a player Philly likes because of his 3&amp;D ability, as well as being able to play right away. Also, Isaiah Jackson might have some appeal to Philly to use in a trade later on…"

Chris Duarte could win ROTY
"Yeah let’s compare 24 year old Chris Duarte with 20 year old Zaire and expect the same… I know calling Zaire Williams a monster is a big reach, but one of them was picked for immediate impact, and one was picked for potential upside, so even seeing the upside in Z. Williams show up already in games is a W for the Grizz"
"Nah bro, he's totally a monster and they really made the most out of trading up. Check this out:  10th overall Ziaire Williams, season highs: 11/4/3  13th overall Chris Duarte, averages: 13.1/4.3/2.1"
Chris Duarte
Chris Duarte
Mobley playing defense like a 5 year veteran was not something I expected.  And Jalen green hasn’t really wowed me after al that talking he was doing.  Chris Duarte is the most surprising for me though
I’m heated because they said that Chris Duarte got fouled and should’ve had the and one. I don’t think I’m gonna let it go for a bit
"[I got down voted](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pjn7tq/comment/hbxstpf/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and went into an extended argument with a Philly fan when I said pre-season that the 76ers GM should've swallowed his pride and traded Ben Simmons to the Pacers for their offer of Malcolm Brogdon and the #13 pick.  Brogdon later signed an extension so he cannot be traded any more this season, and that pick was used to get the outstanding prospect of Chris Duarte. The 76ers could've had two players helping them compete for a championship without the animosity being spewed all around.  Brogdon is a distributing PG that can shoot and plays solid D, and if they didn't want a rookie during their run for a title this season they could've traded the #13 pick pre-draft for a contributing vet."
Chris Duarte plays so well for someone older than Joe Biden

I'd rather have Jordan Poole than Davion Mitchell going forward.  Also I find it funny that Chris Duarte is a rookie and is ineligible for this list.
Was gonna say Chris Duarte but he's too old
chris duarte
"I love Chris Duarte, but this is an example of the drawback, even drafted a year earlier, Killian is a full 4 years younger. So much time to still grow for the 20 year old"
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
Old rookies should be expected to be awesome immediately though. They gave less years to develop and are closer to their peaks. Look at Chris Duarte for example. Mitchell’s  production is concerning
"Biased: Chris Duarte  Unbiased: Ayo Dosunmu  Why on the unbiased? Well, it's a somewhat random pick, but he's a second rounder who has actual playing time so it's looking okay. he might develop, he might not. Give it 5 years."
"The Pacers are currently 5 games under .500 and they just upgraded bald coaches from Bjorkgren to Carlisle. I'm curious to see if the franchise finally decides to blow it up, turning him into a tank commander/development guy, and trade Sabonis, Turner and/or Brogdon for picks + young players. Their remaining schedule is the 9th hardest (as far as opponent W/L goes), [per tankathon.](http://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength)  They pretty much only have their own assets as far as picks go after 2023, and they have a couple seconds in the immediate. As far as contracts go, they only have Brogdon, Sabonis, and McConnell signed through the '23-'24 season, as well as their rookies, Chris Duarte and Isaiah Jackson.  So yeah, Pacers... whatcha gonna do?"
Chris Duarte
Chris Duarte MAXIMUM
"Wiggins is only 2 years older than Chris Duarte, the Pacers' rookie..."
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
"You guys made a lot of odd moves this season for sure... Seemed like you outsmarted yourselves with the Ziaire pick too, instead of sticking with your status quo of taking experienced rookies in Chris Duarte?"

Chris duarte
"Part of it is luck and exceptional foresight, not just draft position or number of 1st round picks. Every draft a few guys outside of the top 10 blow up into solid starters or borderline stars, especially if they can shoot. If you added Chris Duarte and maybe Delano Banton to the Wolves' current roster, they'd be a decent team and have a fairly bright future."
"Right after that, Cade plays the #9 pick Davion Mitchell, #13 pick Chris Duarte, and #7 + #14 picks Kuminga and Moody.   He’s playing 6 lottery picks in a row!"
Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
Chris Duarte is the opposite of Jayson Tatum
Chris Duarte
"yes, but at least he plays the odd game and plays it well (avg 22ppg while being a net positive on the court and a better playmaker than anyone else on your squad right now). But you also would have gotten a first round pick out of it, not sure if it was for the 2021 draft but that pick ended up being Chris Duarte who is averaging 16ppg and shooting 42% from deep. That's a lot of offensive production you would have gotten back for Ben (given you would have made the same pick, not a given obviously)...and not to mention never seeing any of this ongoing drama. In hindsight it looks like a really bad decision to turn that offer down...even moreso when you consider the player you were wanting to trade for is in the worst slump of his career and dealing with a long term injury. Damn, you guys really stuffed up..."
I was told 2 weeks ago that Chris Duarte is a hall of fame lock.
*Chris Duarte enters the chat.*
chris duarte isn’t on the raptors?
How many wins would this all-rookie starting 5 lineup get?  * PG) Josh Giddey * SG) Chris Duarte * SF) Scottie Barnes * PF) Franz Wagner * C) Evan Mobley
Literally got downvoted for being a Celtics fan right there.  It's been 7 games and we're talking about All-Stars lmao.  Is Chris Duarte also rookie of the year?
"IMO it should go: 1) Scottie Barnes, 2) Franz Wagner, 3) Chris Duarte, 4) Evan Mobley, 5) Jalen Green"
You mean he's no rookie of the year Chris Duarte.   It's gonna happen. Mark it
I'm not going to declare #1 overall pick Cade a bust but so far he's 0-14 from 3pt range averaging 3 PPG. Meanwhile:  \#4 pick Scottie Barnes is averaging 18/9  \#13 pick Chris Duarte is averaging 18/4  Cade Cunningham isn't off to a ROTY start I think it's fair to say.
Chris Duarte at 10?
Don’t forget 46 year old Chris Duarte
1. Scottie Barnes 2. Evan Mobley 3. Chris Duarte 4. Josh Giddey 5. Jalen Green
Dude. Chris Duarte is older than Brandon fucking Ingram
I’m sorry is Chris Duarte not good enough for Rick?
Chris Duarte is really good too i had no idea who he was before this
"The 2021 12th overall pick, Joshua Primo, is 5 years and 194 days older than the 13th overall pick, Chris Duarte."
"yes, i know. Most people compare with NBA ready picks like chris duarte (24 yrs old)"
"As a raptors fan I thought he was going to be something special lol.  He had the blueprint.   Any number pick 13 shootinf guard that can fly/ shoot(kobe) usually turns out surprisingly amazing. Donovan, Booker, lavine, now Chris Duarte for pacers is looking good. Tyler hero as well."
"Well if you don’t know who Chris Duarte you obviously don’t watch basketball, so why do you even bothering commenting amigo? 😂"
Wasn't that chris Duarte this yr?  He was nba ready but because he's older he dropped.  They figure he doesn't have much more room to grow i guess
Yeah but kd is fun to watch and who the fuck is Chris Duarte. This was harmless quit your bitching
"How the fuck are some of you defending him not getting ejected lmao..   You can’t bend the rules for a certain player period. If this was Chris Duarte his ass would be tossed in a second..  Read the rules, force and intent are not the same thing people. Holy."

"Other people have mentioned this, but I think Kuminga falls. I think his reputation from preps play kept him high in mock drafts, but we are getting no buzz about some team being super into him and I just am not convinced he is actually that good or that high upside.   Assuming Barnes goes top 5, I think the Thunder take Giddey at 6, highest upside player they could find there.  If he falls past them, I actually think the Warriors take him.  And Magic take Moody if the Warriors don't.  Wagner goes to Kings at 9 and is actually a good pick.  Knicks draft Sharife, Thibs loves quick guards and they could use someone that can get to the rim and make plays even without spacing.  Their other pick could be a shooter, like Chris Duarte, a good fit in a Thibs offense, Corey Kispert, or Trey Murphy.  Bucks draft Joel Ayayi.  Might be wrong, but that is the vibe I get based on what I know of the sorts of players Bucks typically value.  All around player from a good NCAA team who can play off the ball well.  I could see them taking Neemias Queta too.  I think Keon Johnson might be a draft slider, while I think Springer actually goes to Pacers at 13.  Tough for non-shooting guards in the league, have to have special characteristics."
"Why not get the win-now pick at 14th though? They worked out Chris Duarte, Corey Kispert, and Trey Murphy III yesterday who all could easily go 14th (hard to see Kispert last til 14th though.) They could use the 7th on a higher ceiling player like Bouknight, Moody, or Giddey."

Chris Duarte
"1. You might get better feedback on r/NBA_Draft  2. Who tf is Bones Hyland and why are you mocking him to us especially when Corey Kispert, Franz Wagner, and Chris Duarte are still available"
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
"&gt;Chris Duarte at 14.  Big reach. 24y/o, limited athleticism, short wingspan."
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
"Scottie Barnes is such a Warriors brand of player tho, he’s a switchable defender, 6’9, can make play and read the floor well.  But I guess your Team want more offensive talent?  Corey Kispert and Chris Duarte would be good Fit with NBA ready to contribute"
Chris duarte?
Draft Chris Duarte and go for a center in free agency. Maybe a marquesses Chris’s and run it back
"Honestly, I think most Thunder fans are so focused on praying they get two Top 5 picks in the lottery, they haven’t bothered thinking about later picks. But personally, I hope they get a wing. I like trying to trade up for Moses Moody in the late lottery, but there have also been rumors that Presti gave a promise to Chris Duarte.  EDIT: As for picks in the 20s, Jalen Johnson seems like the high-upside, low-floor pick Presti likes to take chances on."
