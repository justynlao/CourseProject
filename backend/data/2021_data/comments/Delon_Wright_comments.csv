"On the hivemind aspect:   There are 3.8 million users on this sub. Even if only, say, 100,000, are on here regularly, that's still a huge number of people. And, with that many people, you're going to see a huge number of different opinions.   So when a player (say Delon Wright) has a bad game, all of the Delon Wright haters will come out of the woodwork to argue their case- because why would they argue that point when Delon is playing well? Meanwhile, the Delon stans will sit back, not wanting to waste time in an internet argument.   r/NBA or any other sports sub (both r/soccer and r/nfl are accused of this too) isn't a hivemind swinging wildly from hot take to hot take. There are lot of different people with a lot of different opinions here, and the reddit upvote/downvote system only encourages those people to strike when the iron is hot and their opinion seems reasonable."
Delon Wright and Blake Griffin helped too
"Shoutout to Dwayne fucking Casey for putting Blake to make sure we lose this game  Shoutout to Delon Wright, for missing a easy wide open 3, then stutter back on defense, zero effort, then Bog ended the game  Well, we still tanking while still competitive, unfortunately, Dwayne Casey does not want to let the rookies play on a team that is rebuilding"
"Turned a few teams down that wanted to take him in the 2nd round, went to the Raptors who put him on the G-league team, developed him, brought him up, kept improving, won a ring and got a FMVP vote, secured a big bag, set a couple of records including franchise single game scoring.  Looking back at that Gleague team that won it all it was kinda unfair: Pascal, FVV, Poeltl, Delon Wright, Bruno were all on the roster"
"Other names include: George Hill, TJ McConnell, Elfrid Payton, Delon Wright, Ricky Rubio, Brad Wanamaker, Tyrese Halliburton and Alex Caruso"
Traded away Delon Wright.
"RAPTOR has CJ 7th with Capela, ahead of Lebron, AD, Gobert, KD. It also has Jordan Clarkson and Fred VanVleet as the 15th and 16th most impactful players, above Steph and Beal. It also has Patty Mills ahead of Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, and Lillard. What an accurate statistic! Advanced stats are meaningless, just use your eyes and you can see Lebron is clearly the most impactful player in the league  edit: Not to mention Shake Milton, Delon Wright, Terry Rozier, Bobby Portis, and Monte Morris have a higher RAPTOR than Donovan Mitchell despite him playing with Conley like you said. Since RAPTOR is such a good stat, Utah's GM should have been fired yesterday for giving 82nd best player in the NBA a max contract when he's no better than Josh Hart."

"What a difference trading Seth Curry, Delon Wright, and Justin Jackson makes...."
Okay. Delon Wright.
"Delon Wright was actually pretty awful. Low IQ plays, very hesitant to shoot, and overrated on defense when he was here. Glad he's doing alright in Detroit as I liked the guy, but he was a big disappointment.   Boban was also just a huge matchup liability. He cannot rim protect (0 blocks this year in 100 minutes, and a 0.3 BPG guy), he cannot defend in space, he cannot defend on the perimeter and he cannot reliably hit 3s. So basically he can only play when the other team has a big back to the basket center who is slow, which is basically no one. We can play him on Jokic for stretches, but that's really as much as it gets. Boban as much as I like him is just such a matchup liability."

"Who does Delon Wright remind me of? I wanna say Michael B Jordan, but I'm not completely sure...  Edit: autocorrect. Meant to say Mikal Bridges"
"Nope. They made Sign&amp;Trade to send Wood to the Rockets and got from them the 16th Pick (Isaiah Stewart) and Ariza  DETAILS The Rockets by trading Covington to Portland got Ariza+16th Pick+2021 Protected 1st.  Detroit then made a 3-team trade with Dallas and OKC. The Pistons got Delon Wright (Dallas), the Mavs got James Johnson (OKC), the Thunder got Ariza (Detroit) and Justin Jackson (Dallas)"
Play creation? Where?   He's a better Delon Wright.
"Delon Wright, Jeff Green, Aaron Gordon"
Oh yeah delon wright the God jj the God and c Lee the man who played like 5minutes in 80 games is whats costing our offense.
"Kristaps hasn’t played, Seth is gone, Delon Wright is gone, JJ Barea is gone, Courtney Lee is gone. Not to mention someone like DFS had an outlier shooting season last year.   As individuals that might not seem like much, but even the guy you mentioned is one of the best shooters in the league being traded for a average shooter."
"I'm the last person whose gonna apologize for Weavers mistakes. I'm in the camp of, he's great for the draft...but probably bad at everything else. I mean you seen the contracts he was dishing out (Grant at 20mill &amp; Mason at 8mill) when he could have kept Wood (even if we overpaid) and still kept Josh Jackson as well (to fill in for the Grant role). You saw the trades he made (bringing in Delon Wright and trading four 2nds and Kennard for Bey) and now we see the results of his moves...which is more taking. But it feels more like accidental tanking, that purposefully."
Feel like a solid trade would be delon Wright to the suns who need a 3rd guard
I was actually asking because in 2K I blocked a shot on Giannis with Delon Wright and this happened and he didn’t get the block
"I feel like we keep getting hit by huge games from role players. Gallo dropped 38 on us a few days ago, Jalen Brunson had a big night, the Pistons slaughtered us with Delon Wright and Saddiq Bey a while back. Anyone else feel like this has been happening a lot?"
"I think we originally intended to compete this year, not tank.  Vincent Goodwill reported that we were in on the FVV discussions but just got priced out. This occurred AFTER we signed Grant.  So imagine Blake is back to playing like he did in 2019 (third team all NBA), Rose is playing like he did last year, and then we add in Jerami Grant, FVV, Plumlee and Delon Wright.  Is that a world beater? Of course not. But that team probably competes for the 6th spot in the East.  Griffin, Rose and Hayes being as bad as they were was a surprise and now we're mostly trying to tank (as much as Casey likes playing vets 35 mpg).  It explains why we went through the different machinations to stretch guys instead of just biting the bullet."
"Trust in Morey and this coaching staff. Big upgrades over the slop we've dealt with the last seven years.   I do think they're either going to add a piece like Lowry, or heavily upgrade the bench with multiple pieces like Delon Wright and Bjelica.   We can also pray for Irving to return with the original people and take another hiatus from basketball."
"Curry-Richardson was a trade that sacrificed offense for defense, Kleber, Finney-Smith and Porzingis have been hurt, Delon Wright is gone and Powell is struggling to return from his achilles injury as you'd expect a rim running big to, going from shooting 64% last year to 44% this year.   Potentially unpopular opinion: I think Luka can only fool you so many times as a defender.  He's got every move in the bag but once you adjust to his pace, left handed-ness, deceptive passing and preferred scoring moves he goes from maybe the best offensive player ever to merely elite, especially when he doesn't have another dynamic offensive player to lean on.  Like Harden, Steph or CP3 have largely failed to do, Luka may have to find another gear athletically to dominate in the playoffs without a stronger supporting cast."
"The whole “Lonzo pushes the ball well” has got to be one of the most overstated skills of any player in the league since Kevin Love’s outlet passes. It’s like everyone wants to talk themselves into Lonzo being better than he is. His D is above average, but not great, his three is (currently) above average but not consistently good.   He’s a solid player. A rich man’s Delon Wright. A poor man’s Fred VanVleet."
"Ben Simmons' defense two seasons ago was tremendous in the playoffs. Kawhi was only slowed down when defended by Ben. He didn't get to play in last years' playoffs.   He has had two years to improve on that end, in which he undeniably has. Brett Brown made the decision to run with Jimmy at point against Toronto,  and Jimmy cited that decision as being one of the many reasons Brett had no idea what he was doing.   Ben is so much more valuable than fans realize, and it's evident by the fact that when coaches got to vote, they recognized it.   That said, I do think we need one of the two additions because your concerns aren't entirely far off. We need a Lowry like talent or a huge bench upgrade with multiple talents like a Bjelica and a Delon Wright."
"I’m just spitballing. George Hill would be another one, maybe Delon Wright?"
The Raps trading away Jonas Valanciunas and Delon Wright for Gasol 2018-19 Truly an all in single season move that worked.
Maybe until Delon Wright or Hayes comes back. Saben Lee is on a two-way contract at the moment so he might be a good pick up now but not for the rest of the season.
"Yep! Hes been so good. Its crazy it took a Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, And Ellington injury to see him unleashed. Weaver really hit on 3/4 picks and Killian may not be a bust (we have to see him play more than 7 games)"
We had 30m that same year and brought in Seth Curry and Delon Wright
"Sixers have some of the best net ratings for individual lineups because of how good their starters have been, but the bench is a MAJOR weak point  I wouldn't be surprised with someone like Lowry, Lavine, Fournier or Oladipo with some guys like a George Hill, Bjelica, Ellington, Delon Wright, Larry Nance, etc. to fill some holes on the bench  Lowry would obviously be more difficult with Toronto saving their season"
He's the only 'bad' defender on that list? Unlike defensive stalwarts TJ McConnell and Delon Wright?
"I didn't watch this game, but the previous games he's been with the Pistons he was getting around 12 minutes and he was actually solid. The only thing I don't like about him he's shooting too many contested 3s and he's not a very good shooter. This game I guess Casey wanted to see how he plays on more minutes, or I got the impression from another poster that Delon Wright was hurt, maybe that's why he played more."
Korkmaz to Detroit for Delon Wright or Wayne Ellington.
If you want to throw in Delon Wright as well that would be appreciated
"Gary Clark, Delon Wright, Bismack maybe lol"
Someone told him the Pistons are going to the finals so he got a Delon Wright tattoo and learnt his Pistons history
Delon Wright shoots threes like he’s not strong enough to hit the shot from that far
"Luck and scouting are important, but I agree that player development and culture are really important. Just look at the Raptors drafting Anunoby, Siakam, Delon Wright, Norm Powell and FVV after the 20th pick, or in Fred’s case undrafted. Heat and Spurs have also done a great job with this."
"Josh Jackson and Mason plumlee are not getting traded, and delon wright shouldn't and probably won't. Idk why but everyone has an obsession with selling everyone that isn't young, it's ok to have some vets and rotational pieces. Also next year is Blake's last year of his contract, waiting it out isn't really that bad"
"This is such a weird choice by whichever subsection of the NBA gives out these awards. Delon Wright, playing for the same team, averaged 17/6/6 this week with excellent percentages."
Yeah that's why the philly series was so bad. Undersized guards versus like the shortest player being what? Jimmy butler 90% of the time lol.  And I remember the size issue is what made some people think we should've kept Delon Wright.
"Saddiq's play was absolutely crucial in the Boston and NO wins considering how little Grant contributed in those games.   On the other hand, if you were going to give this award to Bey you probably could have given it to Delon Wright considering his level of play in those wins."
Delon Wright is severely underrated. He could very well be a Shaun Livingston type player on a contender.
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
Delon Wright
"Divincenzo ,DJ Wilson and a 2nd for Delon Wright ."
"The 2019 offseason we opened up about 40M of cap room for Kemba and/or Danny Green. We got nobody so we resigned all of our UFA (Dwight Powell) and RFAs (KP, Kleber, DFS) to go over the cap and used the trade exception from the Harrison Barnes deal to ship two 2nd round picks for a sign and trade Delon Wright. Seth Curry signed via MLE, Boban BAE. Later on in the season we used more of that TPE to trade another 2nd pick for Cauley-Stein who didn't play in the bubble and was later resigned. We let the remaining exception which was still around 10M expire.  Then we traded Delon Wright and Justin Jackson and one or two more 2nd picks for James Johnson lol.  Our draft picks this year aren't looking too great so now idk what the front office is gonna do. This is the last offseason coming up before Luka signs his big ass extension."
Damn mavs could really use delon wright right about now ..
Wouldn't the Mavs be better if they just kept Delon Wright and Seth Curry
who's our second? Delon Wright?
"Raptors always had good bench units in recent years. Like FVV, Delon Wright, OG, CJ Miles, JV, Poetl ect. Forget how it changed from season to season, but just in general.  Early 2000's Kings were pretty sick too led by Bobby Jackson"
"Yeah what?? Like I can understand thinking he's overrated, but he's got to be one of the least polarizing players out there. Very chill guy.  This is like hating Delon Wright."
"I would take the current Pistons with prime LBJ or prime MJ to make the 1 or 2 seed in the east, I would at least think they have a shot.  Those guys are just that good imo. I think the bench would be weak but Delon Wright, Elligton, LeBron, Jerami Grant would have LBJ on the floor with some decent to good 3 point shooters and defenders. Just missing a big really but its not as if the Nets have any bigs of note.  Looking at the roster the big would be Plumlee lol but somehow I am still foolish enough to believe."
"saddiq, beef stew, killian, sekou, josh jackson, grant, svi,...delon wright maybe"

"Sometimes it comes down to which team is hungrier.  Cleary the C's wanted to hug that L more than your quote-unquote Bad Boys. Deal with it.  If you want to point fingers, maybe talk to your bro Saddiq Bey, clearly that m'fer didn't get the memo as he was racking up a career night against the Celtics.   Your team is legit trash. Watching them play, all I could think of was that Saddiq Bey and Delon Wright, will never be the 1-2 punch on a tanking team. If you want to legit tank, the Pistons have to find worse players than these 2.   I watched them make play after play, and hit shot after contested shot. Fucking losers. If either of those guys had that killer DNA, they would have done a better job of missing their shots and drawing offensive fouls.  I'm sorry that we stole the loss from your guys tonight, but the Pistons played less worse than the Celtics, and didn't have what it takes to be the worst team in the EC."
did Delon wright just jump with the ball and then start dribbling?
"IIRC, JV said in an interview that Kyle texted him to ask about his ring size, and said that he’d accept one if it was offered.   For whatever reason, we opted to say no and not offer one to him or Delon Wright, citing that “the league’s precedent sides with them” or something to that effect.   Quite a few people are still irritated about it, myself included since JV played with us for a big chunk of that season and was a big piece in our team for years."

"The Pistons happen to match very well against the Lakers and Nets because of their size. I thought about betting on them defeating the Nets and I would have made some cash but I read Delon Wright was questionable and didn't do it, damm"
This post is 25 minutes old and there isn't a single mention of Delon Wright in the comments. But his play over the last few weeks has been great. Lead the team in +/- tonight and he thoroughly outplayed Kyrie. Always a great defender and it feels like he's figuring out the offensive side.
"Hayes has been out indefinitely since early Jan with a labral tear. Without him and Rose our PGs are Delon Wright, Frank Jackson, &amp; 2nd round rookie Saben Lee. He'll get plenty of minutes."
"Not better than Delon Wright, that's forsure."
"If you're banking on Delon fucking Wright to get hurt for DSJ to get 25-30 minutes then the answer is ""his play will not be impressive."""
"Kawhi liked everyone on the team well enough, especially Kyle, Serge, and Norm. The only drama that anyone knows about for sure is that Delon Wright was complaining about playing time."
"Kings were acc pathetic. I don’t understand how they were so bad. Their game plan was just “let’s shoot the ball from anywhere at anytime, especially if we’re contested.” Youre playing a team of literally rookies, with our best player being Cory Joseph, why tf are you crumbling like this   Free Delon Wright smh"
"No, that cap space was used to resign Dwight Powell who was a UFA and the remainder was to resign bird players DFS, Kleber, and Porzingis to operate over the cap. The trade exception created from Barnes was used for Delon Wright and later on Willie Cauley-Stein at the cost of three total 2nd picks.  Out current potential cap space is mostly due to Tim Hardaway expiring and Josh Richardson who was acquired from Seth Curry who we signed while over the cap."
"They were probably one of the strongest defensive teams in recent memory.  Also, Delon Wright (and Jonas) was traded for Gasol."
"Lmfao I would. Our bench is literally a bunch of rookies &amp; hella soft vets. You really think Wayne Ellington and Delon Wright were chirping at Blake? Blake was literally the mentor, the leader, to 80% of this team a few weeks ago"
"You aren’t familiar with the elite tier spacing that Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Josh Jackson, Delon Wright, Killian Hayes, and Jahlil Okafor were providing Blake early this season so that nobody was clogging the lane defensively?"
Really? I think it’s Delon Wright by a mile
Delon Wright
"It was Svi before being traded with delon Wright 2nd. Now (I'll get down voted by pistons fans for this) it's sekou. Just has no feel for the game and his lapses are painful. Glad he barely gets in the game, he needed another year in the g league. Now that he'll be going into year 3 it seems unlikely till after his contract is up, or the team declines his option. Doubtful a trade would bring much back."
It also means their trade value is alot lower than taking a 19-20 yr old if they end up disappointing. Cam Reddish for example would still be a great trade piece. If he were 24-25? You're looking at Delon Wright who was traded for two 2nd picks.
"We were trying to sign FVV to pair with Grant. I don't think Weaver's initial plan was a tank, but he's pivoted to it.  It also aligns with all the dumb machinations we went through to get Delon Wright.  https://mobile.twitter.com/VinceGoodwill/status/1330203272712425473"
Also we just traded solid Delon Wright for trash Cory Joseph. Isn’t that also a clear tanking move?
"People give Casey a lot of shit (some of it deserved, some of it not), but one thing you can’t deny is that he gets the most out of all of his players. If he can’t even make Dennis Smith a solid backup like Delon Wright or early career Freddy, then there’s no saving him."
"never change, delon wright jr."
Reminds me of dion waiters when lbj was rumored to re-sign w the cavs. Gotta love see delusional and cocky players.   I have a special soft spot for Kelly cause he talked shit to Delon Wright after a playoff game and delon stuffed him as he was trying to pad his stats  Never liked kelly after that
"dude is so good that when you google Delon Wright , josh pops up instead. he's good enough to be 2 players at once"
"1. Assists is not the sole defining measure of a PG. Who would be your ideal backup PG?  2. Our bench unit bricks a lot of shots. How many FGs are made by Mavs while Luka is off court?  3. Brunson is a 2018 2nd round pick who has only started getting regular time this season. IIRC, his primary position was always PG.  4. When Brunson plays alongside Luka, he takes SG role. How many minutes does he get to play PG? Won't that decline further in playoffs?  5. If Brunson hasn't improved, why would Mavs trade away Delon Wright?    --‐-------------‐-------------------------  I don't think Dwight was available to us. 76ers were supposed to be prime contenders with Harden coming in as well. Dwight chose them to get another ring.  Even WCS, despite his limitations, declined his option and got extra money from us. Isn't Hassan Whiteside playing on a vet minimum contract for Kings? Would you rather have Whiteside over WCS?"
Demar and Poetl hurt but it felt like it was really needed and then it still felt like just business.. but don't know who shares the sentiment but when we traded JV and Delon Wright.. that one was a bitter sweet feeling because it felt like the last important push needed but those guys were truly part of the OG squad
Haliburton and Delon Wright is such a good backcourt for years to come.   Plus there's also Fox in there too.
"Some good, some bad. That big Spurs run behind DeRozan came against Delon Wright and Terrence Davis."
Yea I can’t believe we really traded Delon Wright for 2 seconds and Cade. Fleeced!
"Delon Wright wont make that happen  On the other hand, CoJo already has us on an L streak"

Delon Wright
"&gt; If Maxey and Thybulle turn out to have the level of impact that JV and Wright had then Philly would be ecstatic.      Once again you're ignoring age and contract control. JV and Wright were 26, expiring, and more or less capped out in terms of development, so the Grizzlies basically paid for their bird rights.            &gt; Thybulle has no offensive ability for his ceiling to be much higher than what it is now     I don't disagree with your point about Thybulle tbh, but he's still All-Defense in his second year and acting like that doesn't have value is silly. If he can become semi-competent on catch and shoot at all he's gonna get paid 20 million a year.        &gt; Maxey was a 21st pick that hasn't shown anything at the NBA level    Saying he's shown nothing is pretty ridiculous given he has scored more in an NBA game than either JV or Delon have and they're both 8 years older than him. Like I don't think we need to worry about him sticking in the league long term."
"Dude we traded CJ Miles, Jonas Valuncinuas, Delon Wright, and **an extra** 2024 second rounder for a 34-35 year old Marc Gasol.   I understand our situation was dire given how we were a full out win now mode but that's the difference. Do you think 12' OKC wouldn't have went full out let's go for the ring if we could go back in time?  I don't think teams are grasping how hard it is it get to the Finals or some shit. These players' windows are very limited, if 76ers, the Bucks, or even I'd say Heat (repeating)/Celtics don't reach the Finals in the next few years I'll be the first to say it's the same OKC situation. Deep regrets.  LeBron when he returned back to Cleveland after their Finals run remember how hard Tristan Thompson fought tooth and nail for his extension? Check that shit up right now, 4 months a contract stalemate that included missing training camp.   People probably forget right? I remember people here were giving shit to everyone. Tristan 8.5 points 8 rebounds ain't worth 20M! Tristan Thompson is valuable he can defend all positions! Look at LeBron and his posse helping his buddies get rich and ruining our future! We are screwed if we sign Tristan long term if LeBron leaves! Dan Gilbert is too cheap once again!   Seriously. Prime example of a win-now. Houston fans and media already praised Houston for attempting to go for a win-now mode even against arguably the greatest teams of all time. They seriously capped their future but they were very close and majority agreed it was well worth it.  Lowry is a needle pusher. How many times did Boston fans go on the fence about Danny Ainge not trying to win-now. They had chances to get Paul George/Jimmy Butler remember? Seeing Jimmy Butler's success on Miami would he + Eastern Conference Finals that went 4-3 against LeBron not been a good try in 2018-19?  Trying to protect your future is very important but when you have a realistic shot at the title there should no question you go for it."

"They focus too much on being a football school.   Also a lot of the talent gets recruited and divvied up amongst the powerhouse Pac 12 and to some extent the Mountain West programs. If you grow up in a talent rich SoCal there isnt one or two particular programs you choose from unlike Bama/Auburn, Texas/Texas A&amp;M, Ohio/Ohio St, or Michigan/Michigan St etc...Theres a ton of options. You can go to UCLA, Arizona, ASU, Stanford, San Diego State or other really good programs on the west coast.   Also because its so talent rich, if youre a lesser star recruit for instance playing in SoCal, you might either slip through the cracks or think of being the star of a nearby Pac 12/Mountain West program than being more of a role player for USC/UCLA.

"Barton probably isn't available, as the Nuggets will want to make a real push and their bench has already been weakened. I know he's having a down year, but I think the Nuggets will want to hold regardless. Tucker, Delon Wright, and George Hill are likely gettable- in particular, I think Wright would be a great fit. He's having a career year and is a positive on defense who can playmake. The 76ers have shown they really need a playmaker with Simmons out, and Wright can be that guy IMO."
"yeah but i would rather be going after a raft of other guys than overpay for that. Instead of just getting lowry, try get a combination of delon wright/tucker/hill/Mills/Barton.  Possibly look at Hield if Sac sell low. Morey is a solid GM so he isn't going to make a dumb move. So if the raps want to keep him so bad, he won't sell the farm. he's not dumb."

"After Detroit traded DRose, Delon Wright probably became Detroit's best ball-handler and pick and roll orchestrator. Decent shooter who seems like he's improved his jumper, and he's always been a crafty lanky guard who can get into the paint and splash out to shooters or finish himself."
"That last possession was brutal.  Walton waits until 9 seconds left on the shot clock to call a timeout, then draws up...that?  Delon Wright dribbling around for a bit?"

"DELON WRIGHT IS A KING, THANK YOU."
"oooh, the Delon Wright faction! Never met your Guild before. Tell me more!"
May I introduce you to Delon Wright?
"&gt;Man is literally walking with his back to the ball on a fast break in the 4th quarter  First of all, all ten players are in the frame at the beginning, that's not a fast break.    Second, Drummond is already deeper than everyone except Hield/Kuzma in the corner, so there's no reason for him to be running anywhere at that point.  Finally, yes, he loses sight of the ball early, but he recovers long before it matters.  If you pay attention, you'll see that Drummond starts this clip helping out a little on Delon Wright -- probably not his job right there, but it's not a lack of effort problem.  &gt;then doesn't even bother to contest a layup   Look at Drummond's feet.  He's outside the restricted area to the side, at that point.  All he can do from there is foul Holmes, and probably give up an and-one, just like Schroder does.  &gt; I don't know what to tell you...   This is because you haven't the slightest clue what you are talking about."
"Marvin Bagley, Harrison Barnes, and Delon Wright all have the Mavs circled on the calendar"
Delon Wright finishing this game with a vengeance.
If anything we won more games because Hayes missed time. Early on we had Delon Wright playing pg and he was so good we had to trade him away lol.
"We’re destined to have a combo guard every year that ends up disappointing us. DSJ two years ago, Delon Wright last year, JRich this year. We need a secondary playmaker next to Luka, but none of the guys we get seem to work out.  I’m worried that we’ll overpay for Lonzo Ball, who also isn’t a good enough playmaker right now in the half-court."
If just being bad = tanking than the term is meaningless especially in the context of this thread which is directly referring to the strategy.  Tanking has only been a term the last decade or so. It was a buzzword popularized to explain what the Hinkie Sixers were doing for the most part which was strategically aiming for a higher draft pick vs trying to win games.  If the Kings were tanking they wouldn’t have traded for Delon Wright
"Tough to say. Raptors roster is all-around more talented, but starting Delon Wright at PG is pretty rough, and Serge isn't really a 4 at this point in his career. If I can run DeMar at the 1 and do, like, DeMar/Powell/Green/Kawhi/JV, I'd probably take the ex-Raptors, but it's still a weird lineup whereas Irving/Rozier/Hayward/Morris/Horford fits pretty damn well."
Delon Wright is so good though!!!
"Don't you dare compare our two teams right now.  One is the best team in the West, and the other closed a game with Delon Wright and Terrance Davis."
Imagine playing so regular dudes like delon Wright and richaun Holmes are killing you
"I didn't know until recently that Delon Wright was Dorrell Wright's brother, yet I've heard the commentators say that during the last two Kings games I've seen. Weird. It's like when you learn a new word, and then hear it everywhere."
Apologies to Delon Wright for indirectly putting him through that  raptors legend
"&gt;But then this has literally nothing to do with losing those guys.  ?? Yes it does, this whole conversation is about how you are worse after losing those guys. Other teams have been able to replace guys who leave easier.  I don't blame you for trading for Kemba - at least that was an attempt to replace Kyrie, but you didn't replace Hayward, Horford, Morris, or Rozier with good enough players.  Contenders are able to find value in the bargain bin every year, don't give me the whole ""woe is me"" bullshit as if you didn't have options available. Covington was traded for a mid-round first. Horford himself was dumped for nothing. You could have moved Hayward last year before he jet set on you. Dwight Howard is a backup C on a contender, Torrey Craig is a rotation player for a contender, You didn't want to move for Aaron Gordon last year when you had 3 1st round picks for up grabs. Jordan Clarkson went to the Jazz for nothing. George Hill, Delon Wright basically moved for nothing but you went for shitty ass Jeff Teague instead.  Please don't act like there was no alternative. Ainge made some wrong moves in trusting goes, drafted the wrong people, etc and these are the consequences."
"You’re right about that, Delon Wright"
He's starting Haliburton who is currently top 3 in the ROTY race. Delon Wright plays 20-30 off the bench. What a weird pair of issues to choose when there's so much else you could have picked lmao
If Kevin Lovin you is wrong I delon wanna be Wright
"One trade I didn’t understand was the Cory Joseph+2 seconds to Detroit for Delon Wright. Why did the Kings give up 2 picks for Wright? He’s on the exact same level CoJo is, both mediocre backup point guards.   I don’t understand the Kings man, they should’ve sold high on Barnes, moved Hield, and not given up draft capital for a guy like Wright."
"I remember Billups as being similar to like a Delon Wright. Not the best, not the worst, passable as a starter but you would still be looking to upgrade. Then he got onto those Detroit teams and really found his jumper, the rest is history.  Steve Nash was really good at the time, and it was considered weird at the time that Cuban wouldn't extend him. Especially since the guys they paid instead (Walker, Finley, and Jamison) were all gone in a year anyway. It looked worse because D'Antoni's system was such a perfect fit for Nash's game, but it's not like he was a nobody before he left Dallas."
Delon Wright noped the fuck out of the way lol
"Literally none of these guys lead their teams in touches.  Booker ranks 76th in touches per game, behind guys like Delon Wright, Elfrid Payton, and Theo Maledon."
Memphis records are silly.   Delon Wright is 2nd (tied for 2nd now with Ja Morant) all time for Memphis triple doubles and he played 26 games with them total.
"I looked up the roster changes just out of curiosity (roughly organized by minutes played)  -  **Atlanta Hawks:**  * Out: DeAndre Bembry, Damian Jones, Vince Carter, Jabari Parker, Alex Len, Allen Crabbe, Jeff Teague (not a roster subtraction but Hunter/Reddish have played less time this season due to injuries)  * In: Clint Capela, Solomon Hill, Danilo Gallinari, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Tony Snell, Rondo/Lou  -  **Mavericks:**  * Out: Seth Curry, Delon Wright, Justin Jackson, JJ Barea, Courtney Lee  * In: Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Wes Iwundu, Nicolo Melli, a pu pu platter of bad rookies (Green, Bey, Terry, Hinton)  -  Amazing how the Hawks basically replaced 7 bums with ~6 genuine rotation players ranging from solid to great. The Mavs definitely downgraded, and Josh Richardson gets worse every day he's away from Miami."
Before the trade deadline our guard depth was quite bad. Now we got Delon Wright and Terrance Davis III who come off the bench and play better defence than our starters. Personally I'd rather Davis start over Buddy. Our front court depth is still quite bad though.
That’s the Delon Wright I remember in Dallas.
"Also, Delon Wright is a good NBA basketball player. He needs to start or play way more minutes."
"There are a few guys I've always wondered what their stats would look like with really high usage. Guys with pretty good per-100 stats and (some of them) pretty good advanced stats, but just never high enough usage.   * Dejounte Murray, Devonte' Graham, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Delon Wright, Monte Morris, DeAnthony Melton, Patty Mills, Malik Monk, Shake Milton  I think Murray, Graham, and Bogdanovic could easily put up All-Star stats under the right circumstances. The others I'm not too sure about but I've always been really curious what would happen if you gave them more opportunities.  I think Goran Dragic is an example of one of those guys who always had really impressive stats in low minutes for the first few years of his career, then found himself in a situation with more minutes/opportunity and really thrived. Same with Fred VanVleet."
"My thought is that, if this same shot was made by someone like delon wright, trevor ariza, lonzo ball, etc. We'd be impressed but we wouldn't associate the shot itself with  GOAT shots such as the trevor booker's backwards love tap w/ the Jazz. But because it's doncic, who is synonymoud with NBA david copperfield, we give him that extra association bonus.  And that's ok 😎😎😎"
"lol I genuinely don’t understand your move to trade for Delon Wright, giving up 2 seconds and a beloved vet in CoJo. It’s not like Wright moves the needle or anything. Literally fleeced, we got the better player AND two picks"
"Yah, just like when we traded JV, Delon Wright, CJ Miles and a pick for a 34 year old Center."
We got rid of Delon Wright for not shooting 3s when open.  Not exactly sure how Ben is going to work any better.
"Much needed, the last two seasons Mavs have been horrible with drafting and trades, 3 draft picks last season and they're all shit, trading Curry for Richardson, trading 2 second round picks for Delon Wright then giving up two second round picks to trade him to Detroit then Detroit trade him 2 months later for 2 second rounders to Sacramento wtf were you doing Donnie"
"Ironic.  &gt; Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. **It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry** and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  &gt; Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says. **Nelson remained the team’s president of basketball operations, a role he has held since 2005, and other executives and agents continued largely communicating with him or Cuban regarding personnel matters. Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J. Redick in 2021**. But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
I feel like you’re actually Delon Wright
"Y'all are overthinking this ""who proposed trading up for Luka"" thing.  Luka was a consensus #1 overall pick.  Vlade psyched himself out because he knew Luka's dad, who was a hot-head.  Suns drafted for fit, and if Ayton ends up being a top-5 center on both ends of the floor and can't be played off the floor in any series, then people will forget he was taken over Luka (this is already happening).  The wacko shit going here is Bob pushing for non-shooter Delon Wright, Rick starting him the first game, then overruling Bob to bench Wright.  *That* is the only evidence of a power struggle that I've seen any evidence for.  The rest is anonymous sources.  Could be assistant scouts for all we know."
"I realize this is mostly a joke, but the situations aren't even in the same universe. This whole article is being published against the backdrop of Luka literally saying he is going to sign his Rose rule extension, but involves speculation about a rift that ""could"" impact Luka ""in the future."" Worse yet, the article half-heartedly notes that Volugaris' contract is set to expire, a fact buried deep in the piece because it obviously doesn't support the faux-concern this article is meant to drum up.  Not to mention, if you read the description of Voulgaris as the ""shadow GM,"" it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny. The entire thing is primarily based on anecdotes about how Voulgaris pushed for Seth Curry and Delon Wright and two of our draft picks, but Seth and Delon are **not on the Mavs anymore**. Moreover, the article strangely notes that all of the big trades made by the Mavs have been spear-headed by Donnie Nelson and that Voulgaris approved of them, but stops well short of suggesting Nelson needed or required Voulgaris's approval. Altogether, other than complete conjecture, none of the ""facts"" in the article support the notion that Voulgaris served in any capacity other than as our director of analytics, which is a capacity in which it would make sense for him to provide lineup insights to Rick Carlisle. The article goes a long way to twist this into something nefarious, but it makes no sense.   The concerning thing coming out of the article for me has less to do with Luka and more to do with whomever in the Mavs organization so clearly has an axe to grind with Voulgaris and chose to try to make him look bad to Tim Cato. That internal rift is what the Mavs actually need to address."
"Two 2nd round picks for Delon Wright, Delon Wright + 2nd round picks for James Johnson, James Johnson + 1nd round pick for JJ Redick, a guy that was injured, washed and clearly stated where he wants to be and where he wants to go, aka wont stay after the season."
"Delon Wright is a great analytics player. Relatively efficient, low usage, good defense, decent shooter (though he hasn’t been a consistent one over his career.). He’s a guy who’s a plus on every roster, per the numbers. But, as the Mavs situation illustrates, he’s only that plus when he’s used right, which is a coach’s job. You can’t just slap him into the startling lineup because of the data. Analytics are supposed to fill in the gaps so we can better understand and use players, not define their usage. The small ball C thing perfectly illustrates this. Daryl Morey didn’t play small ball with the Rockets because he wanted to eliminate the C position, he did it because his data showed that PJ Tucker and RoCo were defensively capable of playing the position, and were comparatively underpriced."
"Dallas announced Voulgaris’ hiring in the fall of 2018 with a title — director of quantitative research and development — that vastly understated his actual role. Multiple league and team sources tell The Athletic that Voulgaris has been the most influential voice within the Mavericks front office since joining the team, either initiating or approving virtually every transaction made over the past two seasons. Those same sources add that Voulgaris has frequently gone as far as scripting the starting lineups and rotations for longtime head coach Rick Carlisle.  That influence has spanned Doncic’s three seasons in Dallas. While he had been drafted prior to Voulgaris’ arrival — Donnie Nelson, the team’s longtime president of basketball operations, was the driving force behind trading up to acquire the Slovenian wunderkind, a process he described in detail to The Athletic last year — Cuban had sought out Voulgaris’ basketball advice in the years before putting him on the team’s payroll. As one team source says, “Mark Cuban is the most powerful person in the organization, but whoever he’s listening to is second.” Cuban was won over by Voulgaris’ vision: an analytics-driven spread pick-and-roll offense with Doncic as the focal point which he has tried implementing in the past seasons.  It’s unclear when the Cuban and Voulgaris relationship began, but their coming together is perhaps unsurprising given Cuban’s origin as a self-made tech billionaire whose first major purchase was the Mavericks. Voulgaris has never been shy about his desire to run a team. In an ESPN feature from 2013, Voulgaris is quoted as saying, “The whole process (of becoming a highly successful gambler) has led me to believe that I’d be able to put together a better team than almost any general manager in the league. If not maybe all.”  The way Voulgaris tells it — the ESPN feature is the only notable reporting ever focused on him, and he declined an interview request from The Athletic shortly after being hired — he began gambling on the NBA in the late 1990s and had made millions by the early 2000s. His success, he says, came in part from an instinctual reading of certain coaches. It finally failed him during the 2003-04 season, causing him to lose much of his gambling wealth and step away temporarily, only returning once he’d developed an analytics model that brought back his old edge. He says he did exactly that, his new model beating the odds at a rate higher than five percent. In 2009, he gave up gambling again to consult for an unnamed NBA franchise. The advisory role lasted one season; he returned to his previous life afterward and began publicly promoting himself. In the coming years, he became a well-known presence in the basketball world.  Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason. He was traded that offseason.  Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says.

But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
"We traded Delon Wright off too, he really did do all the little things pretty well, but just seemed to hesitate too much when the time came to shoot.  Never could fit in with the starting line up like we hoped, but did alright with the bench unit.  Josh Richardson has become a worse version of Wright."
"It's not just FA. It's also the draft and his trades. Seth for Josh. His complete inability to recognize talent in the draft, bar Luka and Brunson. But I don't even give him credit for that since everyone and their grandma knew that Luka was the right pick.   The way he spends 2nd rounders like candy while accomplishing nothing.  If you follow the trade from Delon Wright to Reddick. We basically gave up 5 2nd round picks for an injured Reddick. I repeat 5 2nd rounders. For a team that barely has any assets, that's a deathblow, just abhorent asset management. It's purely inept. He needs to be fired."
"2 second round picks for Delon Wright, 1 second round pick and Delon for James Johnson, 1 second round pick and Johnson for Redick and Melli.  That's 4 second round picks buddy. Obviously not worth a ton but it's still throwing away shit for nothing cause you keep fucking up every trade."
[Don't forget that he's also played against Delon Wright Sr. and Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuPdZ7K7JIA)
"as far as average nba players go someone like Delon Wright feels right, he's not exceptionally bad or good at anything, he's just average to slightly above at everything"
"He actually seemed to play better for a bit during the season, but holy shit did he look like last year’s Delon Wright out there this series"
"Well that depends on the team. All the players that are currently on the team when they win get a ring. The other players that were on the team at some point during the regular season but got traded or waived are eligible for a ring but it is up to the team if they want to give them one. The warriors gave out rings to guys like Anderson Varejao ( he got one from cleveland the same way too), Jose Calderon, Briante Weber, and Omri Casspi  even though they weren't on the team when they won. The lakers gave rings to Troy Daniels, Demarcus Cousins, and Zach Norvell even though they weren't on the team when they won. The Raptors are the only team (That I know of) to not give rings to players that left midseason. Delon Wright, JV, CJ Miles, and a few other guys were eligible to get rings but they decided to not give them one."
For the raptors we only give rings to the ones on the playoff roster. So we end up not gave a ring to Jonas Valanciunas and Delon Wright. CJ Miles too.
Delon wright and Terence Davis we're available for nothing at the deadline too
"Trade Kuzma for some sort of ball handler IMO. Not sure who would take Kuzma for 13 mil and get rid of a good ball handler to do it though. Maybe even try to get someone like Delon Wright, a serviceable ball handler who can run the bench while Bron sits.   Also let Drummond walk, IMO."
10-13. Good back-up pg. he’s slightly better than Delon Wright who makes around 9 mil.
“Bring Delon Wright back or I’m walking”
"Kings:  1. Fox 1. Haliburton 1. 2021 Pick  1. Barnes 1. Holmes (if he resigns), otherwise Delon Wright 1. Terrence Davis 1. Buddy 1. Bagley"
"Kings:  1. Fox 1. Haliburton 1. 2021 Pick  1. Barnes 1. Holmes (if he resigns), otherwise Delon Wright 1. Terrence Davis 1. Buddy 1. Bagley"
"de'aaron fox, tyrese haliburton, buddy hield, harrison barnes, and richaun holmes should really be enough to get it done within the next five years imo  funny thing is their roster seems better than their record, like bagley isn't trash and he comes off the bench, they've got delon wright and terence davis hanging around there too, you can do much worse than fox for your superstar and the supporting cast are above-average starters. It just all goes awry for them every time because 1) terrible fo 2) bad coaching 3) it's the kings"
Dennis Schroder is Delon Wright with Lakers brand cache
"Look at Fred VanVleet, Siakam, JV, Poetel, Delon Wright - all developed under Casey. He was great for those young players"
Sending out Kings picks instead of currently zero picks from the Kings. End tally for the Blazers would probably look something like:  * Barnes * Delon Wright * Thybulle * Maxey * 9th overall * Kings '23 * Kings '25 * Sixers '23 * Sixers '27  I think that's a pretty fair haul for Dame seeing what other stars have gone for.  But yeah I agree. Trade looks pretty awful for the Blazers and the Kings as he posed it.
"Delon Wright was traded at the deadline,  the likely starting lineup will be  Hayes Cunningham Bey Grant Stewart   with a mix off the bench of: mason plumlee, saben lee, josh/frank jackson, and a likely late first rounder as the pistons will probably try to trade back up with their 3 seconds"
"I could see detroit taking 2-3 firsts and bagley in exchange for sending jerian grant to philly. Not sure if he's too redundant with tobias still on the roster, but I dont think this trade is *super* unreasonable:  PHI gets Hield, Grant, Delon Wright  DET gets bagley, george hill, #9 pick this year, 2023 SAC top 5 protected pick, 2025 lotto protected pick  SAC gets Simmons and some second round picks or shake/maxey, or plumlee from detroit to fill out their front court with a few extra 2nds going to DET instead of SAC"
"I think they want players back instead of picks, maybe a Paul Watson or a Delon Wright if they can find salaries to dump/match."
"As Long as it's not Fox/Hali...all of em.  Don't think he's  necessary. Best trade is Barnes for Wiggins, pick swap this year and salary filler they choose. Delon Wright?"
They probably think Delon Wright or Josh Richardson deserved to handle the ball more lmao
"&gt;  so I'm not sure why he is even relevant.  I brought up CJ Miles because you brought up the Marc Gasol trade. **""and it came at the price of two former first rounders (both drafted higher than Maxey and Thybulle!)""**. As if former draft position means anything when it comes to trading players, but your point is incorrect. JV was drafted 5th overall. Delon wright was drafted at the same position as both Maxey &amp; Thybulle. Miles was drafted later than both of them. But you didn't even acknowledge my main point of Maxey &amp; Thybulle being on rookie contracts having much more value than all 3 of those players that were traded for Gasol.     &gt; (And if you think the fact that Marc Gasol's $26m player option at 35 years old added value compared to Lowry's expiring + Bird rights, I'm not sure what to tell you.)  Where the fuck did I say that? I literally said ""Third, Lowry has much more value than Gasol did seeing as Lowry is commanding players on rookie contracts and 1st round draft picks.""  &gt; do you REALLY think Morey made the right decision keeping Maxey, Thybulle, Danny Green and some late 1sts  yes seeing as that's a bullshit offer for 35 year old lowry. If they get him this offseason it will be for salary (hill/green) a prospect (Maxey or Thybulle) and a single 1st round draft pick."
"&gt; and it came at the price of two former first rounders (**both** drafted higher than Maxey and Thybulle!)  God raptor fans suck. First of all, JV was the only player drafted higher than Maxey or Thybulle. Delon Wright &amp; CJ miles were drafted 20th and 34th respectively. Second of all, none of those players were on rookie deals, which Maxey and Thybulle both are on. Third, Lowry has much more value than Gasol did seeing as Lowry is commanding players on rookie contracts and 1st round draft picks.  Such a poor argument you made that didn't paint the comparison fair at all."
"Okay, so an unproven young player (Grayson Allen), a rotation wing (Jae Crowder), filler (Kyle Korver) and 2 first round picks (#23 in 2019 + the protected 2020 pick). From my understanding the ask for Lowry was Maxey and/or Thybulle (young player/s), Danny Green (rotation wing), Mike Scott (filler) and potentially 2 first round picks (both of which would most likely be in the late, late 20s). Okay, so the ask for Lowry included one extra asset, and I understand valuing Thybulle (not Maxey) very highly, but consider that it would have been a trade to a division rival and direct competitor (which is never discussed), Lowry has a way better resume than Conley, and both teams knew that the 76ers' guard play was their weakest link.  The Gasol trade didn't involve any first round picks but did involve JV, who was one of the team's main centers, and Delon Wright, who was also an important rotation player. The commonality is that it required parting with important rotation and depth pieces to shore up a glaring weakness in the roster.  Did it guarantee anything? Of course not. Gasol could've broken his pinky toe a week before the playoffs and it would've been a disaster. But when you have a guy like Embiid playing the best basketball of his life and you know his clock is ticking, you have to maximize your team's championship window and Morey failed to do that."
"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It’s important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he’s more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty’s shoes I move him via waive if we can’t get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it’s all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox’s athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
I read somewhere Delon Wright asked to be included in the Marc Gasol trade due to lack of playing time behind FVV
Valanciunas Delon Wright and a 1st is a lot more than scraps.
It feels like only yesterday that I was thinking Delon Wright was our guard of the future and FVV was tradebait without a clear spot in our lineup lol
"&gt; less talented players like Fred have flourished because they found a good spot for themselves  When Fred first signed with the Raps he was the 4th PG in the rotation behind Lowry, Cory Joseph, and Delon Wright. Then there was also DeMar, Norm, and T-Ross who had guard minutes ahead of him. He earned his way into this spot, not because he found a good spot"
"Tbh FVV was a pretty bad roster fit for us coming into the league, we had a ton of guard depth that he was buried behind.  It's a testament to his hard work that he eventually beat out more ""talented"" guards like Delon Wright, Cory Joseph, Norman Powell, etc."
Delon wright as well.
"Booker’s low assists are one thing. The issue is that hes consistently has a turnover problem in the past that hasn’t gone away despite not being the main playmaker. The only guy with at least 2.75 turnovers per game (he has 3.1) and the same or fewer assists per game is Embiid.   It’s just untrue to say all the things KAT’s better at is due to him being a center. Booker’s significantly worse from 3 for example and has been for years.  His advanced stats don’t just look bad compared to KAT’s or centers’, they look bad in general.   He has a negative bpm. Some of the guards above him who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard: Sexton, Reggie Jackson, Brunson, both Murrays, Devonte Graham, Haliburton, Clarkson, Fox, Brogdon, T.J., both Ball brothers, Kemba, Terry, Delon Wright, FVV, Jaylen, Westbrook, Beal, CJ, Mitchell, Jrue, and Conley.  His win shares per 48 is worse than qualifying  guards like CP3, Conley, Mitchell, Jrue, Trae, Brunson, CJ, PG, LaVine, Beal, Jamal, Lowry, TJ, Seth, Delon Wright, Jaylen, Reggie Jackson, Kemba, Clarkson, Connaughton, KCP, Rozier, Hardaway Jr., Brogdon, Campazzo and FVV.   Guys who played fewer games and still have a higher vorp include Kyrie, Russ, Zach, Beal, Jrue, Mitchell, Conley, Jaylen, CJ, Terry, FVV, Brogdon, Fox, Shai, Jamal, both Ball brothers, Kemba, Haliburton, Lowry, Cam Payne, and Thybulle.  There is no reason for Booker to do so poorly in advanced stats across the board on such a good team where other guys do well in advanced stats. Not to mention his advanced stats were still incredibly low when he was a first option."
"They know and have known and are indeed trying. Luka ain't staying for another Delon wright level off season so Mark Cuban was smart to hire two guys that ""players like""."
Depends on the team. Cavs offered Varejao a ring. We did JV so dirty for absolutely no reason. I think it was just cause we didn’t want to give Delon Wright a ring cause he requested a trade.
"This is my tinfoil hat take, but he seems to be the mouthpiece of the front office.  He got the leaks for [the rockets Harden asking price](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kwqmei/jason_dumas_source_the_rockets_asked_for_ben/), [the rumors of Morey not being able to make a deal with Houston cuz of Fertitty hurt feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/md4ql9/dumas_daryl_moreys_relationship_with_tillman/), and he got [the Doc Rivers signing scoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j2ygll/dumas_source_doc_rivers_is_currently_with_the/).  [This tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lkjwab/dumas_the_sixers_are_in_the_market_for_a_point/) might've been Morey trying to drive down the price on George Hill by saying the sixers were looking at Delon Wright,too."
"*Disclaimer: My take on this*  It sounds like a trade deadline offer from Indy. This in no way shape or form makes sense for Indy now as opposed to a couple months ago. I have 0 inside information on this season. but I'm willing to bet that Brogdon was one of the lead guys in the locker room that had a problem with Bjorkgren before that situation boiled all the way over. He's a smart guy and I can see him having a Philadelphia Jimmy-style problem with Indy's coaching staff. Especially in a year where they underperformed internal expectations the math adds up for me.  This however makes 0 sense now because Ben Simmons is the least Carlisle-like guard i think i have ever seen whereas Carlisle would love a guy like Brogdon. The Mavs brought Delon Wright in and then Wright quickly fell out of Carlisle's rotation because Wright was very deferential and indecisive in Dallas. At the end of the Dirk era on Carlisle has built a very guard reliant system predicated on quick decisions and conviction where the guard decides to go with the ball. Luka embodies this now, before Luka it was DSJ and other aggressive score first guards like Barea, Beaubois, and Monta Ellis he really personally gravitated to (even Jalen Brunson). I can't think of a single $20 mil.+ guard that fits that description worse than Ben Simmons.  I think Philly is releasing this now as a smokescreen to artificially prop Simmons' value up because Brogdon, Lamb, and a first may very well be where Simmons' value currently tops out"
Delon Wright
"Better? That really depends on need, both are roll players. If I have limited rim protection and looking for spacing then I want/need Boucher. Just want to point out that Delon Wright got two 2nd's at the deadline and The Clippers just played Zubac serious minutes in the WCF.  Playoffs is contending. If you want a ""sure"" title you might as well give up, because there are always super teams. Even your title team was a bounce away from being a 2nd round exit. No one had Atlanta in the ECF. No One.  Mobley is easy. Trade next years, likely, mediocre first to move up a spot."
"Alright so the top from the rest of the pack.  Rozier, Booker, Oubre, Turner, Harrell, Delon Wright, Richaun Holmes, Larry Nance Junior, Norman Powell.  Thats leaving out Osman, Jason Richardson, Tyus Jones, and Portis."
Well they were actually trying to make the play-in last year which is w hy they bought Delon Wright. IIRC the Celtics and [Nuggets](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/23/nuggets-harrison-barnes-kings-forward-harrison-barnes-trade-deadline/) wanted Barnes with their TPE and Kings said [no](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31110462/nba-trade-deadline-latest-intel-most-likely-deals)
"During Dirk's twilight, yes. For the last few years though, Haralabob has been at Cuban's ear so it's hard to blame Donnie for *all* the mistakes. It sounds like he wanted Dragic rather than Delon Wright, for example."
"Hard to judge Donnie that harshly when we really have no idea which recent moves were his and which were Haralabob's. Delon Wright was one of the worst moves we made, and that was Bob's idea (Donnie wanted to trade for Dragic, but it got nixed at the last minute by Bob/Cuban to save space for Wright).  Ultimately, I do think Donnie needed to go...but not because he was objectively bad. Rather because he and Cuban clearly had opposite visions for the team. Cuban should have let him go 5y ago instead of hiring Haralabob to undermine him. It was a short-sighted move and it's led to this horrific situation.  Also, please don't drag Rick into the conversation of ""living off success."" Notoriously abrasive? Sure. Dragging subpar rosters to the playoffs with weird-ass lineups around an aging Dirk? Also true. Rick was too close with Donnie to stay once Donnie left, but he wasn't ""living off past success"" as a coach. He was *succeeding* every year."
"I can only hope that the new FO (which is actually one hired through competent channels with real due diligence rather than nepotism and false promises) is going to turn it around. Monte Mcnair has already overhauled the scouting department which had in part been responsible for some of these dubious draft picks over the years. He hired Phil Jabour who was previously a scout for the 76ers, The Magic, and The Rockets and was the head of the department in Philly when he left in 2020. Not to mention pulling Wes Wilcox in as an Assistant GM who was responsible for some of those great Hawks teams from a few years ago. Did some minor trades during the season with good value proposition to pick up Terrence Davis and Delon Wright, and drafted Haliburton earlier in the year. I haven't had any major issues with anything he's done besides endorsing Walton for next season. However, that could be because we don't want to continue the cycle of having a revolving door of coaches until someone appears who will be a legit upgrade. Maybe he's waiting for a fresh faced coach to pop up, maybe he actually believes in Walton. I'm not sure yet, but I can't particularly hold this current FO accountable for actions taken prior to their arrival and can only judge what I've seen. So far its been alright, no major fuck ups yet. I am curious to see what he does this offseason, as I think he can make a splash if he plays the cards right."
"This is the way, although I might target Larry Nance Jr or Rudy Gay rather than Delon Wright. I think our need's bigger at 4 than 1."
"Lonzo isn't much of a playmaker in the half court though. Brogdon I think would be a perfect fit, but I don't think that they can get/fit him. Paul/Conley/Lowry would be good fits too, but not sure they'd leave/would have to be a sign&amp;trade. Rondo and Delon Wright would be intriguing."
"That’s up for the team to decide. In 2019 Valanciunas, CJ Miles and Delon Wright didn’t get rings from the Raptors."
he was still shittier than Delon Wright. Thank God Delon got traded before he could win more games for us.
"Conley for 2 firsts, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, and a traded player exception.  Marc Gasol for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles."
"The two packages our beat writers have floated are Buddy and Bagley plus picks, or Barnes and Delon Wright plus picks. I think the Hield package would me more interesting to get you more spacing, plus you gamble on Bagley turning into something solid with a change of scenery."
"Should be about as much as Delon Wright. So in this market, slightly above at $9-10 Million. Which would be the Full MLE. He should take a shorter deal(2 years) to see if he can improve as a shooter &amp; lead guard to get maybe double down the line if he finds the right team."
"Kyle Lowry fits next to any player, that's part of his appeal. He's a point guard who can play as a SG for another PG (FVV; Delon Wright; Cory Joseph) or be a floor spacer for a scorer (Kawhi; Derozan), or he can be a great playmaker/floor general to get his teams easy baskets for his bigs off PNR (Ibaka; JV; Biyombo) or shooters (Powell; OG). He does this without being exposed on defense and regularly switches on bigs and holds his ground. I can't understate Lowry's versatility despite being a 6'0 PG. He's always played 2 roles for this team, carry our bench lineups as the main offensive player/scorer, and than play a more secondary playmaker role once we have our starters in."
Delon Wright once said that you need to scan Milky Ways one at a time to prevent electrical infetterence
"Trading JV on 20 mins a game, and Delon Wright, is way different than trading DG, Tisse, Maxey, *and* 1sts."
"The ""Fuck It, Let's All Just Trade Our Problems"" Trade. Add picks as necessary:  Sixers Get: Kevin Love, Buddy Hield, Delon Wright  Mavs Get: Tobias Harris  Cavs Get: Kristaps Porzingis  Kings Get: Ben Simmons"
"If we wanted someone who wouldn't shoot 3s, we would have kept Delon Wright."
"Well I meant more in terms of the roster. Could be Bob didn’t like any of Donnie’s recent trades or signings, but was overruled. Seth for Josh trade was not that good, and so far the KP trade has not looked so great. Delon Wright unfortunately didn’t do much here either.   I think the past 2 years were overall successful, but with how much and how quick Luka has won, I’m not sure if he agrees with that or not."
"I wonder what the next domino to fall will be.  Surely Boston won't be keeping all four of Rob/Horford/Tristan/Moses and paying 35mil to backup centers.  It might be Rob as part of a big move trade package and/or if they can't get an extension worked out, or maybe Tristan and a 2nd or two to get a player on a similar salary.  I'd love to somehow get Delon Wright out of him."
"In sum:  Sometime 2018, Cuban hired Bob to be his analytics director. Bob has a background in poker and NBA gambling (developing programs that beat the odds). He made a few millions on it and intrigued Cuban enough to be hired (Bob is also a semi regular guest on Bill Simmons podcasts).  Donnie the GM has been the GM for over 2 decades, overseeing the Mavs success from the early 2000s and peaking in 2011 with the Dirk+good vets lineup. Since then, he has made hit and miss decisions (hits include Monta, and later Luka) and misses (almost everything else since 2011). Still, he oversaw one of the most successful NBA teams of the past 2 decades.  So Bob comes in and starts having a say in Donnie's decisions, cause Mark listens to analytics guys more and more (and crypto-bro - hurrah!). This includes picking Josh Green over Saddiq Bey for example. Identifying Seth as an FA target. And some other decisions that didn't pan out (Delon Wright). This likely started the power struggle between him and Donnie.   Donnie starts fighting back, because it appears his job is on the line, given the rapid ascent of Luka and increased pressure to build a contender around the 22 year old. He likely supplies Tim Cato, reporter, with info on a hit piece vs Bob.  Bob on the other hand sees an opening in Donnie's tenure and does a reddit video that's kinda hilarious in retrospect, showing off Donnie's GM ""Masterclass"" since 2011. So it's a back and forth game.  Donnie loses, unfortunately. Reports suggest the decision to let him go was made before the hit piece on Bob, and many Mavs fans have wanted a change in the front office for quite some time.  Rick has been with Donnie for 13 years, and they go way back. He likely saw the writing on the wall and decided to leave on his own, knowing he was next if they didn't do better next season. He also does not completely jive with Luka, though I'd argue it's a healthy relationship - Luka needs someone to challenge him, otherwise he'll turn into LuGM.  As for Luka. He loves Donnie. Hit and miss with Rick. And supposedly hates Bob. Part of the friction with Rick is apparently the way Bob is able to overrule Rick on some coaching decisions (I suppose lineups?).   Anyway, end of the day... we'll see what happens. I hate that it came to this, but who knows if this will prove better in the long run?"
"We need a coach that can manage egos like Rondo and Delon Wright, not kick them out. All Rick needed to do in 2014 was bend the knee to Rondo, and we win that first round But pride prevented him from doing so.  Don't get me wrong, Donnie was a hell of a GM up until that Monte Ellis game 7 against SAS. Everything he did was solid.  But 5 years later, we seem to be in a thought spot that is only getting deeper, even with a generational talent like Luka. I've always thought Carlisle hasbeen overrated particularly because he is an offensive minded coach that relies on open threes. His defenses have always been mediocre to straight up bad.   As I was saying, Mark is a market buyer. He is in this game to win. There won't be another prime Luka if we keep wasting these exits.  things."
Firing a GM that fails to put talent around him?   He had two chances to get Luka a backcourt partner and ended up with Delon Wright and Josh Richardson. He needed to go.
"No way Masai agrees to giving up the 905.  Having our G League team be a 30 minute car drive from Scotiabank Arena has been instrumental in accelerating our prospects' development.   - Poetl  - Delon Wright  - Oshae Brissett  - Siakam  - FVV  - Powell  - Boucher  - Flynn  Are all players who have benefited from exposure to Raptors coaching staff/facilities while they were technically in the G League.  I think Boston is even a stretch, Montreal is 50+ miles further from Boston than Maine, and Maine is already almost 250 miles away."
"Fuck it, trade him back to the hawks for Delon Wright"
"I feel like if Russ could learn how to fit into a team dynamic, including hitting outside shots, he would've been an 18-20/10/10 guy on a proper contender.   Delon Wright is a 10/10/10 type of dude but he has to be ball dominant and doesn't offer enough scoring to justify it.   Then you have a guy like Jokic who if you held everything the same but dropped his scoring, he'd be great to center a proper offensive scheme out of as you can go to him at the nail and run everyone else around him. He'd probably have a stat line in a 10/10/10 range but if he brought the same defense he wouldn't get a roster spot.  That's what I all think."
Yeah but i could see him getting some burn once Lou retires and if Delon Wright doesn’t play up to par
"Almost all of the Hawks rotation players are 23 or younger, so the Hawks might get quite a bit of internal growth. They also added a nice backup PG in Delon Wright, who’s an upgrade over what they had there last season. I’m a Hawks fan so I’m biased of course. But the Hawks could potentially contend with the Heat for that 3rd spot.  The big question mark team is the Bulls. They’re kinda sneaky, they have several nice pieces now."
PG: Delon Wright   SG: Tyrese Haliburton   SF: Brandon Ingram   PF Tobias Harris   C: Nikola Vucevic
"&gt; There should be a massive market from top teams for good executives because the difference between having a top exec and a middling one are massive.  I'm really skeptical of how big that gap actually is.  I think a lot of it is luck.  We're judging guys based off of incredibly small sample sizes, with countless factors out of their control.  Like, Masai has drafted 10 players since he came to Toronto (not counting this year) and he's produced 1 All Star (Siakam), 1 good starter (OG), 2 low level starters (Poetl and Delon Wright) and some backups/filler.  Is that enough to call him good at drafting?  If Siakam had blown his ACL as a rookie and never made it beyond being an energy guy off the bench, how much would that one freak twist of luck swing Masai's perceived talent at scouting?  Or what if Kawhi's shot against Philly had bounced off the rim and the Raps lost in the 2nd round.  He would have walked, the team would have been forced into a rebuild and the Lowry/Derozan era would have ended in quiet disappointment.  A slight breeze in the arena that one moment could have totally changed Masai's reputation.  There are some parts of the job (like building culture and handling the media) which we have a better chance of accurately assessing, but anything involving transactions has such a heavy luck component that we can barely even sort the good GM's from the bad ones."
"Look at where the Raptors were before he got there and what they’ve accomplished since. Perennial lottery team and laughing stock to averaging 50+ wins and having the best accumulative record over 7 years.   Look at his draft record. He consistently pulls premium players out of late picks and the 2nd round (Norman Powell, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby).  Look at his eye for talent where no one else looks. Picking up undrafted players every off-season who quickly become impact players.  (Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Terence Davis)   Look at his trade history.   In Denver he traded Carmelo to the Knicks where everyone knew he was going to go anyway but got a huge haul of young players + picks including the pick that became Jamal Murray.   He gets to Toronto and unloads Andrea Bargnani  for a package that would include a top 10 pick in 2016 which would later help him to secure Kawhi Leonard.   Then he begins swindling the league  John Salmons = Lou Williams (who then won 6MOTY)   Grieves Vasquez = picks that became Norman Powell and OG Anunoby   Terence Ross + a late 1st = Serge Ibaka   Derozan, Poeltl + a late 1st = Kawhi Leonard + Danny Green + 5M in cash   Valanciunas + Delon Wright = Marc Gasol   There isn’t an executive in the league that matches Masai’s overall excellence in every aspect of front office operations."
"They were playing Delon Wright, Justin Holiday, Ivan Rabb, Bruno Caboclo and Tyler Dorsey.   They got Ja Morant right after"
Hawks added Delon Wright for backcourt defense. We’ll see
Whoever got paid to write that article has no idea we traded for Delon Wright.
"Hawks just got Delon Wright and the Knicks have Rose and Kemba. Celtics could work for Richardson, but the trade couldn't happen right now they'd have to wait 2 months."
Based on what overrated Lonzo just got paid...Delon Wright
"Lmfao how are you downvoted? Payton Pritchard averaged 7.7 points a game (19 min) last year. If Payton's an NBA level scorer then Dennis Smith Jr. should be considered a scorer 7.3 pts (19 min). Also Draymond is a scorer at 7.0 per game. Delon Wright averaged 10.0 a game, he must be scorer too? TJ McConnell dropped 8.6 a game, he can score the basketball.  Yeah right, this sub man."
He's the only actual average or above defender on the team after the Delon Wright trade. he improves their defense when he's on the floor but they are horrendous on that end when he's off.  On the other end he's one of the best play finishers in the league because he's a good FT shooter who can catch lobs.   I'd like to see him in a different team context because bad coaching+bad defenders isn't something a single dude can clean up.
Delon Wright
"Easily, but Nate is definitely going to use Delon Wright and Lou will as backup pg options before he gives Sharife any minutes"
"Hawks in 5, 6 at worst. Trae is a borderline superstar and is only gonna get better. Plus the Hawks supporting cast is way better. They also added some really nice supporting pieces this year in delon Wright and gorgui dieng"
You forgot to mention our first round draft pick Jalen Johnson.   We also added Gorgui Dieng as our backup big and Delon Wright as our backup point guard
"Appreciate the work put into this. It’s a very well written and organized oc. And I agree JT’s next step would ideally be developing his playmaking.  I do struggle with what/how much to take from the stats given where certain other players are ranked. JT posts up twice a game so didn’t look into that one too much but the others all had some results that made me hesitant to put too much weight in them as a proxy for playmaking.  Luka’s tied with Dame for 20th highest assist% off drives (over 10 drives per game). Jaylen’s 24th. Love JB but his playmaking’s nowhere near theirs. Saben Lee, Kemba, Delon Wright, and Fultz rank 4th, 12th, 15th, and 17th and they all, plus Rozier, also outrank Doncic in pass% off drives (Harden’s 27th of 56th in that one, just above Siakam). Jokic isn’t top 10 in potential assists. Schroder’s ahead of Steph and .1 behind Jrue, closer than Jrue is to any of the 28 guys ahead of him. D’Lo’s assist% is better than the majority of guys with over 25 usg% including Giannis, Ja, Steph, DeMar and Shai.   Other metrics put JT in a better light but not sure how much to take from them either. These from Bball index were from the end of april so might’ve changed a bit but that’s most of the season still. Of nba starting forwards, he was 10th in pass creation volume, 6th in pass creation quality, 1st in scoring gravity, 9th in playmaker rating, 7th in passes made, and 14th in assists per game. On his team, he was 1st in pass frequency, 2nd in passes per game, 3rd in assists per game, 3rd in pass creation volume, and 2nd in playmaker rating.   Info and definitions for above stats at https://www.bball-index.com/glossary/"
"I'm not disputing the fact that they had great offseasons. All of those teams got better, but so did we.   We were one of the most injured teams in the league last year. Honestly we should probably be talking about how we added De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish to our roster. Hunter played 23 games and Cam played 26. Even Bogi only played 44 games. We're also coming into the season with much better options at the backup 1 spot. Whatever positives Rondo brought to our team off the court, he was absolutely abysmal on the court. Staring the season with Sweet Lou and Delon Wright coming off the bench is a huge improvement for us.   Also, as others have pointed out we might as well be a completely different team with Nate coaching. I get that you can't just throw out our record under LP, but what we did in the playoffs proved that our regular season record under Nate wasn't some fluke."
"Casual fans think he has actual star potential. He was an All-Star replacement once, and other than that one *fairly good* season I think he has just been average at best. He can collect some stats on offense but he's horrific on defense and analytics think he contributes almost nothing towards actually winning games.  That's not even factoring in his contract. I'd take someone like Delon Wright at $9M over DLo at $30M any day of the week. (Even hotter take: I think Delon Wright is probably just straight-up better than DLo period.)"
I love Delon Wright but he's been a backup for 80% of his career.
"Delon Wright will be back up point to trae, that’s how deep we are"
"Our backcourt was a mess. Easily the worst backcourt in the league. Revolving door of players. Some Killian, some D Rose, some Delon Wright, some Cory Joseph, some Saben Lee, some Frank Jackson, some Josh Jackson, some Diallo, and even a little McGruder.     If I had to guess, I would say that Wright got the most starts at PG, and Josh Jackson got the most starts at SG. I could totally be wrong, but I watched literally every game, and I'm not sure without looking it up. So, I fault absolutely no one for not being up on all that mess.  Cade solidifies one of the positions, but we're still looking for someone to step up and claim the other guard spot. Beef Stew (or maybe Olynyk) will fill out the C position now that Plumlee was moved."
"Well we do in reality, Delon Wright is a bigger, more physical guard who will presumably be the backup and Lou Williams is, well, Lou Williams.  Cooper likely won’t play much barring injury."
"Grizz did something similar, maybe not all to their preferred situations, but to great ones: Marc/Toronto, Mike/Utah, Crowder and Iggy/Miami, Delon Wright/Dallas, Grayson Allen/Milwaukee. But they got good returns for most."
Delon Wright. I got a soft spot for that ex raptor
"We got center and guard depth now with 2 nice acquisitions in Dieng and Delon Wright.  We were one of the most injured teams last year and if Jalen Johnson turns up like he's been, even better forward depth than before which was bad cause we had to start solo (love the dude but he's not a starter)"
"I believe one source of drama was Delon Wright being frustrated that he couldn’t get minutes, even when Lowry was obviously hurt and could have rested.  Lowry had incentives in his contract based on how many games he played; if he made the All-star game etc. Delon was stuck as an 11th man on an absolutely stacked roster in a contract year.   I’m not saying Delon is exceptional but he is definitely a rotation player on a roster, that would be the starting point guard on a lot of teams. He was happy to go to the Grizzlies."
Not only is that  not true but it’s a massively closed argument. For one we didn’t have many holes we have our stud pg for the future in young two young promising wings in reddish and Hunter and two snippets at two guard  in bogi and huerter plus athletic big men in capela and ogungwu. Not to mention we got deeper at guard with the addition of Delon Wright and in the front court in gorgi dieng. Jus cause we didn’t trade all our assets for Bradley Beal didn’t mean we didn’t get better
You can always give enough unprotected picks and pick swaps that something like this will work. It's a question of whether it is worth doing(which it is not in Sacramentos case at all IMO).  But like yes if you give Masai all the unprotected picks a bunch of pick swaps and matching salary in the form of like Harrison Barnes and Delon Wright he's not exactly going to hang up the phone.
"Ignore the other posts they're vastly underrating those guys to hype Dirk up as if what he did isn't impressive without embellishing.   Kidd = Conley/Lowry type vet PG  Terry = Clarkson if he was a legit passer/rich man's Delon Wright  Marion = Mikal Bridges level defense, similar offensive value even though their games are different  Tyson = Clint Capela but DPOY level, or middle class Gobert  Dallas had a strong ass roster, people just expected them to choke."
"He was injured the entire season, but he was really bad in what minutes he got during the playoffs. He was definitely one of the weakest players on the roster and he was only on the roster going into the next season because he picked up his player option. I hope he works out for the Celtics and all, he's athletic and a pretty solid defender but even TT would've been an upgrade, let alone flipping him for Delon Wright."
Woohoo we got Delon Wright!
"DeRozan still hurts - even though it obviously worked out for the franchise. Also surprisingly, Delon Wright was my favourite player and I wish he'd been here for the championship."
"I'd like to nominate the Hawks as a very deep roster as well. Legit 2 deep at every spot.    PG- Trae, Delon Wright, Lou Will  SG- Bogi, Huerter, Mays  SF- Hunter, Cam, Solomon Hill  PF- Collins, Gallo, rookie Jalen Johnson  C- Capela, OO and Gorgui"
Delon Wright inbound🤞
"This is [the trade](https://i.imgur.com/DTigGSZ.png) that will reportedly land us Delon Wright in exchange for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando and a 2023 SRP"
"Schroeder to Boston would be such a disaster. Wouldn't you just rather keep Kris Dunn? Actually, you should have just traded Thompson for Delon Wright!  But even if you messed up on all that, wouldn't Elfrid Payton have gone there rather than be 3rd string in Phoenix?  Brad Stevens - bad start!"
"I mean it was a solid off-season. Two steals in terms of raw talent in Jalen Johnson and Sharife Cooper respective to their draft positions. Turning two literal zeroes on a roster in Dunn and Fernando into Delon Wright who’s a  very capable backup. Resigning Collins for effectively 4 yr/100 is a fair deal. Signed Dieng of course for relatively cheap and he’ll help against bigger teams and be a stop gap till Okungwu returns from injury. And Lou will returning to mentor Cooper and give us quick buckets if needed.  While we Hawks fan are super excited about the direction of the team, we didn’t knock it out of the park in terms of free agency. We signed exactly what we needed and ducked off. The real prize is having a potentially healthy roster. Hunter and Reddish especially. That will be a bigger addition than any free agent on the market."
Don’t forget Delon Wright
"""Who's still on the board?  Myles Turner, Devin Booker, Cam Payne, Kelly Oubre, Terry Rozier, Delon Wright, Bobby Portis, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Larry Nance, Kevin Looney, Montrezl Harrell, Richaun Holmes, Josh Richardson, and Norman Powell?  Nope - we gotta get Kaminsky!""  -Michael Jordan, 2015"
"I don't really see how this is relevant. My point is that at his prime he was good enough to be a starter in weaker team if given the minutes and a slot to do so. Obviously that's not what happened, but given that he's performed similarly or better to some of the weaker NBA starters when playing against or even with them I don't really see  how it's that he ""absolutely"" wouldn't have been good enough rather than that situations/fit didn't align in time.  Even if we are discussing whether or not he could have been starter at the time he played in the league, we'd have the issue that he never really went to a weak team.   I mean how much better do you think players like Delon Wright, Josh Jackson, Jae'Sean Tate, Dwayne Bacon, or Cole Anthony for example are than what Nando DeColo is now or at his best?  Or you can take those guys I mentioned, do you think they would have started in Spurs or Toronto at that time? Hell, I'm not even sure if someone like Rubio or Bledsoe would have."
We went into last year with Brandon Goodwin as our backup point guard and the shrug emoji as our back up center. We've added Delon Wright as a backup PG and Gorgui Dieng and brought back every single important contributor from the team that made the Eastern Conference Finals. This has been an awesome offseason and hopefully we can stay healthy this year!
Because not enough people will know [what you're talking about](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/delon-wright-hilariously-caught-saben-lee-in-4k/)...
I've heard it could also somehow involve the Celtics/Hawks/Kings trade with Tristan Thompson and Delon Wright somehow. There's been no talk about Schroder's contract and no talk about why the Hield-to-the-Lakers trade fell apart so it's at least consistent with the idea that Schroder is still somehow involved.
"Well it looks like Delon Wright and Buddy are both probably being traded, so that would leave us with Fox, Hali, Mitchell, and Davis right? I might be missing someone, but having 4 guards is pretty standard"
Awesome. He was really good for us last year. Delon Wright is 100% gone though now.
"Don’t forget we are replacing Lou Will for Delon Wright backup PG minutes. A far, far better defender with more size. We have a legit backup center now in Dieng instead of having Gallo play backup 5…. Huerter should help anchor our second unit. Now our defense won’t get absolutely torched whenever our starters sit."
We got Delon Wright in a 3 team trade a couple days ago and I don’t think Lou is coming back. Wright isn’t bad and I’m happy we have an actual PG off the bench now.
Idk why he reminds me of delon wright on mavs. Can drive can pass can hit some shots on low volume
"Delon Wright for Luka, who says no?"
Dunn already got moved (to the Celtics) in the trade that got us Delon Wright from the Kings.
Well it's not like Westbrook is the only ball handler in the league. They used all their assets and cap to get him. They made a concerned effort to get Westbrook. In the Hield deal they could have negotiated to get Delon Wright as well from the King's whom they just shipped out. The 22nd pick they gave away for Westbrook was similar in value. The point is they wanted Westbrook and were literally willing to give everything outside of LeBron and AD to get him.
"I wanna believe but they said that about Delon Wright and J-Rich, too."
"Before we traded for Delon Wright and drafted Sharife Cooper, I would've bit you hand off for a good backup PG at only $6.3 million a year, that's an absolute steal."
"Before we traded for Delon Wright and drafted Sharife Cooper, I would've bit you hand off for a good backup PG at only $6.3 million a year, that's an absolute steal."
They wanted Delon Wright instead
"Fun fact, that was almost certainly Voulgaris who nixed that trade. All the rumors point to Donnie being the one who wanted Dragic, but Bob/Cuban peeled off at the last minute to go after Delon Wright instead."
"lol go eat a dick asshole. I never said it was realistic, I never said they should do it, it's just some fun puzzle solving I like to do in my free time. I have gotten several trades correct though. Teddy Bridgewater to DEN, Delon Wright, TT SAC ATL deal, Horford to BOS Kemba to OKC, Anthony Miller to HOU, CP3 WB swap in HOU, Brock Osweiler salary dump to CLE, HOU drafting Davis Mills, TEN drafting Brady Breeze @ 215 overall, etc.. It's a fun side activity that I like to do."

Teddy Bridgewater to DEN, Delon Wright, TT SAC ATL deal, Horford to BOS Kemba to OKC, Anthony Miller to HOU, CP3 WB swap in HOU. It's a fun side activity that I like to do."
" We already traded Prince away under Travis and I think we would rather develop what we have in house over Juancho.  Beasley is the only one we would be interested in, but honestly likely not anymore especially if the Delon Wright trade goes thru.  Wright provides backup PG minutes and combo minutes along with Bogi and K'Von."
"No lol, Delon Wright is literally perfect for us and we are giving up absolutely nothing to get him. This deal was huge for Hawks"
"What the fuck is going on lol, I would like to receive my new Delon Wright in exchange for an expired Applebee’s coupon and moderately used toilet paper"
"Delon Wright, Kelly O and Mo Bamba in fantasy at the end of last year was like the Heatles lol"
"&gt;Suggs is projected be an elite defender  There's a difference between good and elite, he's projected to be a good defender.   &gt;his floor is two way combo guard, way higher than Delon Wright come on now  His floor is not higher than a good backup. Do you realize a floor is his absolute worst outcome? Saying his floor is Delon Wright doesn't mean I think that's what's going to happen."
"Suggs is projected be an elite defender, his floor is two way combo guard, way higher than Delon Wright come on now"
On paper it's defensible. We are wanting a three point shooter-defender who can attack and handle the ball every now and then. He was still pretty decent at the start of the season then for whatever reason he played worse until he can't get any playing time at the playoffs.   Same thing with Delon Wright.
"He's similar to Fox in that it's hard to see the way he turns into a legitimately elite player. Doesn't project as an elite scorer, passer, or defender. Less bust potential than Lamelo and Fox though. His floor should still be a useful backup in the vein of a Delon Wright."
"What doesn't get mentioned is that he made a team that already had Lowry, sophomore Delon Wright, and 6th man finalist Corey Joseph as the point guard rotation.  The absolute last thing we needed was a 6'0 unathletic point guard, yet he beat out a lot of promising guys for that last spot, including Hassan Whitside and hometown guy Brady Heslip"
"How did bob not get strangled by luka is beyond me... Dragić is like his mentor and really good friend thats also an amazing basketball player and they shared chemistry after their eurobasket win, delon wright tho lol"
"fun fact: despite Donnie Nelson getting so much shit for being a bad GM, that move was almost certainly nixed by Bob Voulgaris...he wanted to save room for Delon Wright instead"
Didn’t they trade Delon Wright to get CoJo? And now they’re getting rid of him for nothing?
"He's ok. He can create a little on his own, he can pass a little, he can score a little. The problem in Dallas is that having Richardson do any of those things was significantly less efficient than letting him spot up while Luka did them. And he wasn't a good spot up player. I could have lived with all of that if his defense had been top notch, but it was merely pretty good. He basically ran into the same roadblock that Delon Wright did the year before."
"We also just traded Delon Wright, who I would rather have kept than trade for Schroder"
He'll be kind of a bust. Similar career trajectory Delon Wright has right now. Maybe I'm wrong but I'm not very high on him
"Delon Wright, the story of the guard who every fanbase talks themselves into, and nobody wants to keep."
"Delon Wright is probably the best player involved in the deal and Bruno is horrible, literally a human victory cigar"
you sure about that?  Delon Wright was horrific for us this year  but i know little about kris dunn so i'll hold off saying i know for sure.
Just curious did you think of this because of Grizzlies legend Delon Wright getting traded (Delon &lt;--&gt; Delonte)?
I've always like Delon Wright. I like him for the hawks
Delon Wright was good like 3 years ago he had a couple of triple doubles here and there
For Delon Wright
So it's:  SAC - Tristan  ATL - Delon Wright  BOS - Dunn/Bruno/2nd
"But the thing is the 2 guards on the Kings are also small.   They have Delon Wright, Buddy Hield, Terrance Davis who are all too small to play as a 3 full-time.   With their current roster, the kings are very guard heavy and will likely play some undersized lineups."
"That’s 26 minutes for the 2 and 1 slot though.   Kings have Buddy Hield (34 minutes a night), Delon Wright (25.8 minutes a night), Ramsey (7 minutes a night), and might re-sign Terrance Davis (21.5 minutes a night).   So if there is 26 more minutes to fill for the guard slot, that’s at least 3 guys that are all the size of a 1/2 fighting for those minutes (assuming they don’t trade)."
"Depending on how the Ben Simmons and Kyle Lowry situations go in Philly, I think a Buddy Hield and Delon Wright for Tobias Harris structure might make some sense."
"Right but if you *do* trust your development, the upside here is Kawhi Leonard. A franchise-defining player.  I'm not saying the Raptors have flawless drafting and development. They drafted Bruno Caboclo, Delon Wright and Jakob Poeltl with three straight first round picks. They get a lot of credit on the Anunoby pick but Anunoby was projected to go way higher before his injury so it wasn't really some galaxy brain draft decision to pick him up where he slid to.  I know Wright and Poeltl weren't total busts and, along with Caboclo, were picked late enough in the draft that it's easy to miss on your picks, but the Raptors do get maybe more than their share of the benefit of the doubt due to the success and development of players like Powell, Siakam and Van Vleet.  I'm always going to be nervous about them passing on Suggs until we know how good both Barnes and Suggs turn out to be. I'm just hoping they made the right decision here."
"i forgot about the rookies Lakers drafted, i think that helps for salary filler, otoh this whole transaction is predicated on schroder wanting to play for the kings and the kings wanting to pay schroder what he wants (while also taking on the other odds and ends) and this seems implausible considering including the rookie they just got they already have 4 PGs (De'Aaron Fox, Delon Wright, Tyrese Halliburton, Davion Mitchell)."
Delon Wright going to BOS for TT &amp; assets
"And don’ forget they traded second round picks for Delon Wright last year, unless they deal him they may be rolling with 4 point guards"
They’ll just laugh:  De’Aaron Fox/Haliburton/Schroeder   Delon Wright/Davion Mitchell/Ramsey  The Kings can’t get any more guards right? Right?
"Our backup is Delon Wright for 9 mil. He can be moved very easily in the offseason. Tho he’s solid, this is a move I think that sets us up for a trade and if he can be Marcus Smart who actually can shoot, he’ll be Fred Van Vleet hella fast and that’s a bonus. I might be the only Kings fan that’s wants to trade Fox for Simmons straight up as well so…"
"Off the top of my head we got 2 from the Delon Wright sign and trade, and a second + a conditional second in the Melton trade. May have obtained another 1 or 2 along the way."
Bleacher report player comp for Ayo: Delon Wright
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
Delon Wright is a PG and deserves at least 25 minutes too….
Ya maybe + Delon Wright?
"yeah no we’ll definitely take Delon Wright for Ben Simmons, that will surely do it"
"Honestly I wouldn't hate it if the kings sent Bagley and, like, hield plus a guy like Delon Wright and a first for the Simp"
"Rose, Ariza, Delon Wright and Javale McGee were all traded for basically just 2nd round picks last year besides Fournier, but every year there are guys on cheaper contracts than Fournier that get dumped, Ainge could’ve been way more aggressive in adding talent"
Ok Delon Wright
"JV and Delon Wright got traded in 2019 and still haven’t been back. Danny green hasn’t gotten his ring yet. Kyle, Norm and Serge are coming back as visitors"
"He did a lot of things.  I remember on the in-bounds play after a score, he tried to give offensive players enough room to catch the in-bounds pass, land and turn.  So they always would land directly in front of him and they'd be facing off, getting ready for the offensive player to put the ball on the floor and start dribbling down the floor.  Well, as soon as that ball hand started that first dribble it was a steal pretty much every time by CP.  I watched him do this to Delon Wright time and again one game.  So after a few of those you see the inbounds pass being caught and when the guy lands he does not turn one bit, but stays perpendicular to CP.  Then that first dribble is protected more and they could make the turn or pass.  You still see that issue come and go when CP is in a game against someone who is not an elite ball handler."
Delon Wright
"In a vacuum you obviously take Nique's HOF career over 22 year old Trae. But if you open it up to consider the team, then yeah, the current Hawks would be worse if you swapped even prime Nique onto the roster. Then you'd have Delon Wright driving the bus; no thanks."
"I don't hate it at all lmao. I literally just said asking for a trade is fine and has been done plenty of times, but there are ways to do without alienating your fans or being a bitch.  As a Raps fan, we just moved Lowry at his request. We also traded Delon Wright at his request so he could get more PT. Do you see Raps fans with a rager against either player?  I guess you're young lol, reading comprehension comes with time. Enjoy!"
What is the trade value of these players:  Derick White  Kendrick Nunn  Delon Wright  Alec Burks  Eric Gordon
Are you Delon Wright?

Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
"Dragic is a back up point guard dumb shit.    The pelicans are trying to make the playoffs.  Yeah Delon Wright is a rookie, Lou Williams is a rookie,  dieng is a rookie.  Celtics can trade Schroder and  Dunn  The rest you can look up yourself  You are a complete fucking tool"
"I like this one too, been thinking the same thing:   * They'll have a full season with McMillan, which will help them gel a bit more. Not only that, but they won 68.4% of their games with Nate last year, that's 56 win pace in a full, 82-game season.  * De'Andre Hunter will be back and healthy, people forget they were missing a starter who played like one of the best 3&amp;D wings to start the season.  * They brought back LouWill, who was a nice bench spark plug last year, drafted Sharife Cooper to give them some backup playmaking, picked up Gorgui Dieng (who's a reliable backup C) and Delon Wright (a really solid defensive guard), and they have a ton of high-potential guys like Cam Reddish/Jalen Johnson/Onkeya Okongwu who could break out."
"Does it rly count tho? Then the Hawks should be up there for extending Trae, Collins, and Clint. Signing Delon Wright and drafting 2 rookies who should’ve been a lot higher up"
"This is a list of guards who're all within 2 inches of Steph and clearly better defenders - Kyle Lowry, FVV, Fox, Cory Joseph, Schroder, Delon Wright, Hali, Beverley, Jrue, Smart, Conley, Neto, Rubio, Jevon Carter, Kris Dunn, Dinwiddie, Rozier, Donte, Caruso, KCP, Brogdon, Josh Hart."
"Your starters through 6 man (CJ) are good.  Gotta fill out some depth with the other NBA players though.  You'd want Jake Layman, Mo Harkless, Delon Wright, and Meyers Leonard added.  Those can join along with your idea of Simons and Collins (if healthy) filling out the depth.  After that you get some less playable guys, maybe Evan Turner and Ed Davis.  That gives you a 14 man roster.    Insane guard rotation with Dame, CJ, and Beal.  Your forwards are spottier.  Derozan played PF this last season, but you'd have to fit him and Draymond into the starting lineup.  Jake Layman is a respectable bench SF.  Maybe Wright can get some sf minutes?  Zach Collins (if we pretend he's magically healthy) can back-up at the 4 and 5, then you have Harkless at the 4, though he hasn't looked good since leaving Portland.  At the 5, you have Collins, then Leonard, and a 'break in case of emergency' sub in Ed Davis.  I think that's actually not the worst 14-man roster.  Solid team.  Too many question marks for me, such as the starting line-up having some spacing issues, being weak at SF, and having several questionable NBA players.  ET hasn't played in a couple years.  Edit: I say weak at SF under the assumption Derozan would be playing like a PF still, even if he's in the starting lineup as a SF"
"PG: Trae Young  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic  SF: De’Andre Hunter  PF: John Collins  C: Clint Capela   Reserves: Delon Wright, Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish, Danilo Gallinari, Onyeka Okongwu."
Please keep Delon Wright out of trade conversations
Delon Wright would've been an interesting piece if they had kept him.
Can't sleep on Delon Wright either. He can provide league average quality at backup guard.   I don't expect injuries to stop being rampant throughout the league. Depth is necessary in todays NBA.
"Sry for the homer but im gonna bet $1k on the Hawks over.    1. Hawks were one of the most injured teams last year - our only injuries this year will be Okongwu for half the year and Hunter for maybe a few games.   2. Coach change turned around almost every team stat 180 degrees   3. Young players will at least get slightly better   4. We lost Tony Snell, Bruno Fernando, Brandon Goodwin, Nathan Knight (one 9th man + g-leaguers) for Delon Wright, Dieng, and 2 solid rookies.    All this and we are only set to get roughly the same record as last year (last year we had 41 wins in a 72 game season)..? Easy money here."
"i mean maybe i’m crazy, but i have really been liking the DG/Rubio lineup. those two plus Mobley just make us such a tremendous passing team and i think that highlights mobley   sexton will always look to get his bucket first, while everybody else (DG to a fault) looks to get their teammates involved first   i think keeping ricky, signing Delon Wright, and then figuring something out for a wing in a Sexton trade (Reddish would be cool, but i also don’t want to pay him a lot).   imo if this team is ever going to be a real title contender, it’s because Mobley and Allen are elite on defense, Mobley and Garland are elite playmakers, and because it’s death by a thousand cuts   i don’t think Collin’s iso scoring fits with our two main cogs"
Delon Wright?
Ya the depth we have is not a bad thing at all. Likely gives us the ability to move some of it for older/more impactful players like we did with Delon Wright and Jakob Poetl when we’re getting more competitive.  Stoked to see how the team looks when we get our best player back.
"Literally everything we've done since getting Luka has turned to shit. It's really incredible. KP trade. Signing Delon Wright. Trading Barnes. Trading Curry. 2020 draft. All complete disasters. Reggie Bullock looks good so that's nice I guess, but he's a role player. We really have to turn it around before we lose Luka."
"There are also guys like Delon Wright, who played 49 games for Raptors in 2018-19 (Kawhi year), got traded at deadline and didn't get a ring."
"Pretty much. We have only two players in the roster that can create for others: Brunson (and he is really a SG that works best as a secondary creator than someone to play pure point) and Burke (which isn't good, but he *can* make passes).  Everyone was screaming all offseason to bring in a secondary playmaker to spell Luka. Up to this day the mere mention of Goran Dragic spikes a civil war at r/mavericks. Apparently everyone BUT the Mavericks FO thinks Luka needs someone other than Brunson to spell him.   I would kill to have Delon Wright back to run the offense off the bench."
"JV, Delon Wright, etc."
"Lies.  Gallo can come off the books which will free up 15Mil.  Delon Wright comes off too, that's another 15 Mil.  Lou Williams is 9.5 Mil that comes off.  All of those contracts equal up to 15+15+10=45 Mil.  I don't think Reddish and Hunter will get max contracts.  If you give them both 25 Mil each, its workable.  The lux cap is near 150, they fit, if only barely.  Don't forget that even if they sign next year, they aren't on the books til 23-24.  By then, Bogi will be in his last yr clearing the way for Okungwu's contract."
"Neal/Dinwiddie is not better than Young/Bogdanovic lol. Not to mention the hawks have Huerter, Delon Wright, and Lou Williams off the bench"
but we have delon wright to run the second unit now and huerter/bogi can create a little too
"Yeah, for sure. That first half was just Luka throwing the ball away trying to get everyone involved. For all the bullshit and bad vibes Rick gave off, he didn't ever veer from the fact that Luka needed the greenest of all lights for the team to really flourish. And yes, I get that there's a gravity argument (AKA teams are gonna simply gameplan around Luka and force him to pass) and ALSO a fatigue argument (AKA we saw what happened in the playoffs when Luka had to do everything and ran out of gas in the 4th), BUT that doesn't change the fact that Luka has to score. Period. The guy needs to get in his rhythm and not worry about making everyone else feel peachy.   I don't know if any other new coach would take us a different way, because it's clear that Luka needed help. Like, taking the weight off him was gonna be the gameplan regardless of the coach.   And that leads us to the most frustrating element of all this, the clear argument that has been beaten to death on every podcast and article and season preview----**For the Mavs to be good, KP has to fuckin step up.** The guy looks awkward when he gets the ball and lost when he doesn't have it. He gets the ball taken away when he faces up and he dribbles the thing up to his fuckin chin. IDK what to make of it. I watched him in NY (shit, we all did). He was confident. He was fluid. He played loose and without abandon. All his injuries suck, and I'm sure that those are playing a role in his timid style atm, BUT STILL, the dude has to fucking step up.   Some thoughts on KP specifically (since i'm drunk and feeling it now): --Stop hanging around the perimeter ON DEFENSE. The dude is getting switched out and then just staying there. He's gotta be the weakside stronghold, even after the switch. There were two or three plays tonight where he got switched out on to Delon Wright and then just let Reddish and Hunter blow by their defender without sliding back and making an easy block. Delon Wright? Dude hasn't made a three since Moses was lacing up his sandals...  --GET LOWER. This is what pains me after watching Dirk my entire life. Dirk was skinny. He was awkward and lanky and sometimes goofy looking. But when Dirk got the ball, nobody pushed him around, because he stuck his ass out like he was Cardi-Fuckin-B. Holger taught him all those footwork and positioning drills because if he hadn't, he woulda just become what KP is now--WEAK. The dude has got to push some folks around and create space. How many times did KP get his jumper blocked tonight? 3? 4? And how many times we ever see Dirk get his jumper blocked? Like once or twice over a 20 year career? He knew how to position his body and get space. KP, right now, gets the ball and stands STRAIGHT UP. Anybody who's ever played any sport understands the ""Athletic Position,"" but apparently KP has never heard of it.   --Stop lolly-gaggin around waiting to set a screen and diving at the wrong moments. For all of KP's shooting prowess, he dives at the EXACT WRONG times and clogs the offense. It's like, so fucked. There was a play where he ran Collins straight into Luka on a drive, and Luka go fouled, looking supremely frustrated, but honestly I couldn't tell if he was upset at the ref, at Collins, or at KP for not having the awareness to no clog the lane when it's a easy lay-up.   Damn...sorry u/checkm8300. I got way off there. You're right. That's all I was tryna say.  Anyhow, shitty loss. I want Kidd to succeed because I want the Mavs to succeed.   Everyone, including myself, just have a drink, meditate, smoke something, whatever you do to feel better. It's a long season, so let's hope this is our lowest point."
"A few reasons, but We basically had to bet everything on KP and We have had no tradable draft assets because of it. We traded multiple first round picks for KP after trading a first round pick for Luka. Ironically if there was no lottery system we would’ve had the 3rd pick originally and wouldn’t have needed to trade up. This meant we didn’t have any 1st round picks that we could trade for 5 years (I think?) because of the Stephan rule. It’s really tough to trade for good players without first round picks, especially when all the players you draft are projects (josh green, Tyler hey, etc.) so they aren’t worth much anyways.  In addition, a few years ago we thought we were getting Kemba, but when that fell through our backup plan was seth curry (awesome player), and Delon Wright. Analytics said Wright would be great for Luka (efficient player, good at defense) but he was awful next to Luka (hesitant to shoot, mediocre at best defensively) so that was a bust.  The following offseason, instead of spending our money for guys like bogonovich we were somewhat held hostage by the idea that Giannis might not re-sign with the bucks. Props to the hawks for bowing out of those sweepstakes early and instead shoring up their roster, seems like that was the right move. Because we wanted cap space, we traded Seth Curry for Josh Richardson (1yr deal +1 yr player option). We expected him to be the exact player we were hoping to get from Delon Wright, and that he would play above his contract, thus leading him to opt out of Giannis were to be available. Unfortunately he became Delon Wright 2.0 (hesitant to shoot, mediocre defensively), and Giannis re-signed with the bucks later in that offseason. We also traded for James Johnson (expiring) and then traded him for JJ Redick (expiring).  This off-season we had a decent amount of money so we were hoping for Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately he took his talents to south beach. We seem to finally understand our best option is to just spend our money on good role players instead of swinging for big players, which led to re-signing THJ, and signing Bullock and Brown. I think our roster is better than last year, but the coaching change will likely take some time to adjust for the players.  tldr;  Trading for KP and Luka cost us tons of draft capital  We prioritized cap space for star players, but never signed any star players."
I just saw little Delon Wright grab an offensive board between Luka and Prozingis...
I like Delon Wright but he’s not a good fit with us
Hot take: I kind of liked Delon Wright in Dallas
"He’s been great IMO. He’s made a couple small mistakes that our fans freak out about, like the Delon Wright trade and subsequently letting him walk, but I really don’t care if the mistakes are small. Not every move works out and the draft changes things all the time. But he’s drafted two nice players, and damnit if he didn’t set up 2 awesome trades (Bogdan for Donte sign and trade and Buddy to LA for Kuzma) that would have been awesome but fell through due to last minute bs. I’m confident in the decisions he’s making, if we make enough good ones we’ll get lucky more often than we have in the past"
Not trying to rain on your parade but don't get your hopes up too much with Delon Wright. He was terrible with us.
There's a reason why Delon Wright can't carve himself some rotation time anywhere. He's been getting traded from one team to another for years.
"Locked down young talent(Collins, huerter), signed a legit backup pg(delon wright), fortified our big rotation(dieng), and returned young talent from injury(Hunter, cam)"
we traded him for 2019 cap space and trade exception  which we used to trade off our picks for delon wright and cauley-stein  we then traded delon wright and more draft picks for james johnson  then we traded johnson and more draft picks for jj redick and nico melli.  now both of those players are gone
This is my source. But I may be interpreting it wrong: https://ca.nba.com/news/report-toronto-raptors-will-not-give-championship-rings-to-jonas-valanciunas-delon-wright-and-cj-miles/s6f8safcgsm21my2cmdxmrhdz
This guy ruined Utes basketball until we got Delon Wright. Fuck Boylen.
"Hawks should be 2-5 with the heat. Additions don’t automatically mean things will work out. And we aren’t just banking on improvement from our players, we went and got solid backups in Delon Wright and Dieng, and we will have Hunter and Cam back healthy to start the season unlike last year."
"Outside of Bruno Caboclo, we hit on all of our picks even if they were late:  2015: Delon Wright- 20th   2016: Jakob Poetl- 9th              Pascal Siakam- 27th  2017- OG Anunoby- 23rd  2020- Malachi Flynn- 29th   They were good role players at worst"
I thought Sekou Doumboya would be a poor man's Luka/Lebron hybrid.   Dude isn't even a poor man's Delon Wright lol
He got benched for Delon Wright in the 4th quarter of the closeout game vs Washington too
"there's a very small handful of bench guards in the league that can shoot as well as him and pass. and we got him basically for free by trading a guy who's not currently on any team's roster, a center we never played, and a shitty second round pick.  why do you have a hate boner for delon wright of all people that's so weird lmao"
"Well that’s kind of just arguing semantics.   Mirotic was more affordable so more teams could realistically bid for him.   However assuming all things equal, Gasol was the better player that more teams would want on their roster.   To say the Raptors wanted Mirotic over Gasol is pure speculation. Raptors are a tight lipped organization and the reporter that said the Raptors went for Mirotic than pivoted to Gasol doesn’t report on the Raptors, so I’m not sure how he would have internal information on them.   You also said the Raptors were willing to pay a premium for him, but the only thing we know the Raptors offered was Delon Wright and they didn’t surpass the Bucks bid of 4 second round picks, so not sure why you think the Raptors were willing to pay a premium for him."
"The criteria in the draft is very few busts and a good number of players who over-achieve considering where they are drafted.  So for the Raptors these are their 1st round draft picks:  Scottie Barnes  Malachi Flynn  OG Anunoby  Jakob Poetl Pascal Siakam  Delon Wright  Bruno Caboclo (bust)  Terrence Ross  Jonas Valančiūnas  So 1 bust in 10 years. Pretty fucking good resume.  All of the players on this list are legit NBA rotation players, and a few have become borderline All Stars.   Pascal was selected 27th overall and is now a #1 option who scores +20-25 ppg, made an All Star Team and was All NBA.  OG was selected 23rd overall and is now one of the most versatile defenders in the league, and avgs +17 ppg and 40% from 3 point range.  And the list goes on.  And this is not including the undrafted talent (Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, REDACTED) that they have managed to find over the years."
"I know im a hawks fan but I think we might take the cake.  Our 2nd unit will be some combo of:  PG: Delon Wright/lou Williams  SG: Kevin huerter  SF: Cam Reddish  PF: Gallo  C: OO/Gorgui Deing  Then we have Jalen johnson, Solomon hill and sharife cooper to back those guys up"
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
"Many players shoot 50% from 2. I’ll use the lineup for the Pistons which were the worst team in the league last year.  Mason Plumlee: 63% 2pt / 0% 3pt  Jerami Grant: 47% 2pt / 35% 3pt  Saddiq Bey: 45% 2pt / 38% 3pt  Wayne Ellington: 52% 2pt/ 42% 3pt  Delon Wright: 52% 2pt/ 35% 3pt  Josh Jackson: 49% 2pt/ 30% 3pt  From the Pistons, we see that half the starting lineup shot 50% for 2 pointers. When you factor in drawing fouls, 50% 2 pointers is worth more than 33% 3 pointers as well."
"Ah right, good to know that you've got some solid prospects in John Collins, Kevin Huerter, Delon Wright, Gorgui Dieng."
"Of course it is, the differences in lineups are to blame and the fact that the better offensive Kings also have better offensive units. There’s a reason why in Jas rookie year, the Grizzlies offense was better with him off the court despite him being efficient than he was in 2021.   The defensive difference between Holmes and JB is negligible at best. Holmes is still undersized despite how active he is.   Halliburton, Corey fucking Joseph and Delon Wright are not even in the same stratosphere as the guys I named like Brooks or Slomo. They are average to slightly above average at best and at the guard position, the least impactful defensively.   I didn’t even mention Deanthony Melton lmao, these are entirely different tiers of “good” on defense. And their 7th ranked defense is proof of that.   I never said Fox is head and shoulders above anyone. I just said the Grizzlies core are clearly a much better supporting cast, mainly because of defense. And that is NOT because of Ja Morant."
"WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT BARNES! We could’ve resigned he and KP and just been over the cap then trotted out Luka/THJ/DFS/Barnes/KP with Jalen, maxi, Dwight Powell etc off the bench. I guess we don’t get to sign Seth and Delon Wright if we don’t trade Barnes, but those guys got traded for Josh richardson who turned into Moses brown and a trade exception we won’t use and Delon Wright was turned into James Johnson who turned into JJ Redick who turned into nothing. Yay"
"We're also hurt by a bunch of smaller moves. Seth for Josh Richardson, Delon Wright, all of our draft picks last year, even the Harrison Barnes trade.   The KP trade was a worthwhile swing, but we don't seem to make any good smaller moves either."
"Yep, Delon Wright could be a sneaky big acquisition if he can run the offense to any reasonable degree as the backup.  We're a deep team, with guys like Gallo, Reddish, Huerter, and Lou Will off the bench, but they need somebody to actually keep shit together and run some semblance of an offense or it's just a series of ISO's."
"This is bubble footage. Look at the background — no gym has those lighting fixtures, this is the converted hotel convention/event space. Also, Delon Wright."
"They definitely don't have too for sure, even Delon Wright and Valanciunas didn't get a ring and they played a lot during the regular season."
Casey also loved running lines with Delon Wright or Cory Joseph in for one of the forwards and sliding up DeMar so they had 3 ball handlers. Even did it a bit with Vasquez a while back
It was in the three-teamer that got Delon Wright to Atlanta and Dunn + Fernando to Boston
"In the Delon Wright trade to ATL.   Originally, ATL traded Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn to the Celtics. ATL received Tristian Thompson. It became a three team trade which resulted in TT getting moved for Delon Wright."
Wait when did Delon Wright go to the Kings
He got traded for Delon Wright
"2011- Jonas Valančiūnas to Jan Vesely   2012- Terrence Ross to Andre Drummond  2013- N/A  2014- Bruno Caboclo to Mitch McGary  2015- Delon Wright to Justin Anderson   Pretty rough.   All three were traded for important championship pieces. Caboclo was 2 years away from being 2 years away 2 years ago, but Mitch McGary was worse"
"&gt;Last, last season we had high iq ball distributors like Seth Curry and Delon Wright. Combine that with KP always being a willing passer and we had good ball movement without Luka"
"Isn’t harden starting at PG? I can’t really see Kemba playing with mills, defensively it would be too disruptive. If anything I think the nets could use a longer ball handler, like a Delon Wright"
Delon Wright
"I feel like giving Jalen Johnson minutes can't be worse than Hill and TLC getting them, honestly.   And realistically I'm not sure how giving Cooper a shot can be much worse than Delon Wright and Lou Williams have been so far this year.  That's not to say that you don't want to get your vets right by the playoffs, but these young guys have to be options too.    People love to give Thibs shit for relying too much on the starters and not liking rookies, but he played Obi and IQ big minutes last year, and when we've been missing guys this year he's had no hesitation putting Jericho Sims and Quentin Grimes into games."
"I also know that Bogdanvic and Capella who've been in the league for a while now both look massively improved now that they play with Trae. I also know that John Collins doesn't look nearly as good when he plays with Delon Wright or Lou Williams - both of whom are competent PGs. Maybe some of the credit for Trae's teammates playing so well should go to him.  All I'm saying is that everyone always says Luka is way better and has a way worse team, but every other great player with a bad team has massive on/off numbers. AD had +8.8, +9.4, and +9.7 his last three years in NOLA. KAT has +9.0, +11.2, +5.3 last three years in Minny, etc."
"I loved the way he was squawking about Delon Wright when the Raps faced the Wizards a few years ago in the playoffs. Then, after he failed to back up any of his bravado over the rest of the series, [this was the final play of the series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuPdZ7K7JIA)."
"You could add Danny Green too (since that’s who they originally wanted with what they paid Delon Wright instead)  In fact, just have the Mavs and Sixers combine teams"
"Hey wait a second, that's not the client, that's professional basketball player Delon Wright! 🧐"
"I'm curious what people think of Jalen Brunson. With Rick I always felt he was the guard whisperer so never really thought highly of decent guard play from Delon Wright, Devin Harris, Burke, monta, ect, but Jalen has just kept getting better and craftier even with the Kidd handicap. I know he's a little undersized but I'd be curious to see what he could do in a D'Antoni Suns Nash system."
Wait why was Fitz talking about how much he loves Delon Wright?
Why would Delon Wright say such a thing? He was great for Utah
"he was traded there for kris dunn and bruno fernando, atlanta flipped him for delon wright"
"Dwayne Casey has a history of making guards look better than they would elsewhere. He did it with Delon Wright last year and he's doing it with Cojo.  Joseph is limited, and most of our sub hates him because he's not an exciting young guy, but he's a solid vet and has the highest +/- of all their rotation players."
"I mean it's almost the exact same roster as last year. The biggest difference is Delon Wright becoming backup point guard (kinda). Other than that we changed 3rd string center, 3rd string PF, and have Shariffe cooper on a two way"
"Scrolled through literally all the comments looking for what the 2nd tech was for, still have no idea. I also hate Delon Wright Jr. but these T's are weak af."
"Bones Hyland is the most impressive player in the very early season outside of the top 10, besides Duarte. He is starting to play valuable minutes and a valuable role for a playoff team. Can't get much better than that. Same could be said about Dalano Banton and Ayo Dosunmu, even though both of them thrive because of mostly pure hustle and less because of very valuable, role-oriented skills. At least compared to Bones.  I dig what I see from Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, from OKC. He has the tools to be a good role player in the NBA for a long time. He rebounds well for his size, makes the simple right plays.   Same could be said about Herbert Jones from the Pelicans, but he mostly stands out with his defensive effort because the rest of the Pelicans are really, really bad as a team. Including Trey Murphy III, but he'll figure out his best role once Zion is back. Someday.   I get the mentioning of Sengün, but I don't like the Iso-heavy playstyle of the Rockets at all. He's good at anticipating where the ball goes on defense and he has a few flashes as a scorer and playmaker on offense. Advanced stats love him, eye test isn't that convincing for me yet (looks like a Delon Wright case from the past where stats are more uplifting than the eye test). I'd love to see a whole lot more of Garuba, honestly. It's a shame he doesn't get to play and show his defensive tools - I hope Stone sends Wood or Theis out before the trade deadline.   I'm sensing that Tre Mann is starting to slowly find his shot and confidence on offense. He looks really interesting as a Lou Will type of player. I trust him more than Cam Thomas and he could be visually even wetter than Bones on some nights if he finds his groove and role in Oklahoma. His skill to create separation from defender is pretty remarkable. Buuut.. He has a long ways to go to even earn a stable role in the Thunder's rotation.   I don't truly understand Snyder benching Jared Butler after Butler's poor start (let him play through it, because, God, the Jazz need more athleticism, smart playmaking and youth on the perimeter).   There hasn't really been anything more. Mamukelashvili was... um, tolerable as the worst option in the Bucks frontcourt when Lopez and Portis were both out. I guess you can say the same about Garza and probably Bassey when he gets more minutes as Embiid is in the protocols. Moses Moody will give sporadic minutes every now and then, but I think he'll mostly be in the G-League. Most of the guys outside of the top 10 are waiting for their chances in January-April, when vets are having more rest days and tank race is underway, especially after February."
Not a hawks fan but  Huerter is terrible so far  Capela isn’t fully healthy   Hunter hasn’t played to the level he played last year before injury  Lou and Delon Wright are disappointing replacements for Trae  Bogdan and Gallo could play better than they have played so far   Combine all that and boom 4-9
"39 assists to 21 turnovers, which sucks, but tbfair, no one else can pass in this team. even delon wright cannot"
Trae and JC were good. Capela and Delon Wright were decent. Everyone else was absolute DOGSHIT
"It'd make sense if it's a three team deal including KAT if he wants out, because the Capela Simmons fit is so fucking bad.   Would look something like:  ATL receives: KAT, Isiah Joe and Ben Simmons76ers receive: Collins, Reddish, Pattrick BeverlyTimberwolves receive: Capela, Okongwu and Delon Wright, 2024 and 2026 unp first by atlanta"
"Personally I want more minutes for cam. He is a great defender and is energetic on offense. He isn't very consistent, but additional playing time will help.  Hunter and Collins are bother much better defenders than Towns, but neither one can score consistently outside of Collins catching lobs. Capella and reddish can cover up a lot of the defensive issues KAT and Trae create.  Hunter has been inconsistent and injured pretty often. I know he hasn't been in the league very long, but I'm willing to risk losing him for Towns.  It will also help Trae to have another guy on the court that can draw a double team.  I think a starting lineup of Trae, KAT, Capella, cam, and bogdonavic (if he can remember how to shoot) with huerter, delon Wright /Lou, gallinari, onyeka (when he comes back) and anyone but Solomon hill is a pretty solid roster.  Also I would include Solomon hill in trade because he sucks ass."
"It would leave them absolutely razor thin at the wings. You’d be left starting bogi and hunter which is good. But then there’s zero bench. Bench wings are limited to Solomon hill, tlc, delon Wright and Lou will. And the latter two are more of primary ball handlers and not wings. All of which besides wright have really only played (and not well might I add) in blowouts. Trading Collins, huerter, reddish AND pickS (!?!) for Kat would hurt the hawks for more than help I’d think"
We were better off with Delon Wright and Langston Galloway the last few seasons. Or even Ish Smith.  Like they're not good but they make teammates better. CoJo just plays for himself.
Delon Wright is solid but just not an offensive spark like Trae is. The second unit really plays around cam + who ever is at the 4 then.
"Capela is playing like absolute horseshit, they're refusing to run plays for John Collins, Cam is dog shit. McMillan has somehow decided that Lou should be backup PG over Delon Wright again."
That was the Delon Wright triple double monster end of the season.
"We actually played above our talent level, pulled out some wins against good teams with crap lineups. We beat the warriors at the end of the season with Delon Wright, Bruno Caboclo, Ivan Rabb, Tyler Dorsey and Justin Holiday starting."
My love for Dorrell Wright makes me wish Delon all the success in the world
Man I’m SO relieved that Delon Wright came out instead of Lou
"""Delon Wright is a treat to deal with, but his brother... kinda guy you think, wow, I never want to see *that* guy again. Oh, he's on our pre and post-game show? How about that."""
GO HOX! If Nate doesn’t play delon wright then i will be very displeased
"Then....Occam's razor.     Make the G-League playoffs more prominently known.     If you're indicating that it's already in the time span, just make the g league playoffs more important in the span of the all star break.     It's unrealistic but make the G-League playoffs matter to nba fans.     I know for some teams, the G League is important. I'm looking at the 905 cause that's where Siakam, Vanvleet, Delon Wright, Poetl, Norman Powell Boucher and a few other of their guys came up. Jeremy Lin also came up there yeah?     It would be scuffed but tying some kind of incentive for the parent teams would make the G League matter more."
Also Mavs let him go in free agency for essentially getting Delon Wright instead
The fact that Lou Williams is playing over Delon Wright is making me question Nate’s judgement. The reason we went out and got Delon was because we have no playmaking on our bench when Trae comes out and we’re wasting him smh
"Bench Mob (FVV, Delon Wright/Norman Powell, CJ Miles, Poeltl + Siakam aka Yak &amp; Skills) will always hold a special place in my heart."
"Masai literally traded CJ Miles, Delon Wright &amp; Jonas Valanciunas for Marc Gasol."
"Delon Wright Jr. keeps getting sonned, son"
**2021:** Scottie Barnes (4) and Dalano Banton (46).   **2020:** Malachi Flynn (29).   **2017:** OG Anunoby (23).   **2016:** Pascal Siakam (27) and Jakob Poeltl (9).   **2015:** Delon Wright (20).   He's barely missed. The two who have left have shown to be really tidy players too.
"Not only the Kawhi trade but doubling down with the Gasol trade at the deadline.   All told, we sent out 4 young players Toronto drafted and developed in DeMar, JV, Poetl and Delon Wright, as well as a bench piece (CJ Miles). All these guys are still doing well in this league.   Just really savvy team building that put us in position for a win-now move and shows why every single draft pick and development of all are important. You can’t hope to win otherwise, unless you’re a fan of a glamour market team. Trading 5 key depth pieces shouldn’t be possible and yet we are still in a great position now, just 2 years later."
Every coach loves that man lol. Kings fans were cheering and smiling from ear to ear when we traded Joseph and 2 seconds for Delon Wright because it meant no more 30 minutes of Joseph every night
"Yeah and the league is driven by superstars, nobody is going to a game to watch Alec Burks vs Delon Wright, lmfao. The NBA will soon realize that not calling these shooting fouls are screwing up superstar players efficiency and they will adjust soon enough. I mean, maybe Trae and Harden aren't getting every call they got the year before, but it will be close come the end of this 82 game season imo.   It seems like to begin the season they are tryna make an example outta Trae/Harden so people stfu about them and once All-Star break rolls around, I am sure they'll start getting more calls again. Not to mention, I am sure Trae and Harden and Embiid and all them are gonna figure out a loophole to this new rule change to start drawing more shooting fouls again which should also help them get their free throw attempt rate closer to where it was last year as well."
"Lol   Also I forgot to add that you’re wrong about Tristan Thompson too. We didn’t overpay him, we just took on the second year of the contract Boston gave him in exchange for Delon Wright.   Anyway, stay dumb."
We will take him for Delon Wright and a first @Golden State
"utah and atl  utah has literally 2 6moy caliber players, nuff said  hawks have a deeper bench than utah, but talent wise it's close. lou, gallo, reddish (who's popping off, mip run????), huerter (has been terrible so far, but no worries), dieng has been serviceable, also delon wright is a perfect backup pg"
"Financially, the FO had been pretty impressive. They take almost every opportunity to trim bucks where they can. Waived Avery Bradley before his contract became guaranteed, did a sign and trade of Delon Wright to get a million or so off the books, and signed Tyus Jones for less, and the CJ Miles deal especially was a masterpiece. Saved money trading for Dwight Howard, then saved money again with the buyout.  Knowing the financial advantage of a 30th pick vs the 31st is right in line with that savviness."
2015: Delon Wright with pick 20  2015: Norm Powell with pick 46  2016: Jakob Poetl with pick 9  2016: Siakam with pick 27  2016: FVV undrafted  2017: OG Anunoby with pick 23  2019: Terence Davis undrafted  2020: Malachi Flynn with pick 29  2021: Scottie Barnes with pick 4  2021: Dalano Banton with pick 46
"There’s literally no way the Sixers would do a deal based around a Lowry sign and trade and a few throw away assets.    If a Lowry S&amp;T is the best they can manage, the Sixers could just do Simmons for like Delon Wright and a protected first (again not going to happen because his value isn’t that low) and use cap space to sign Lowry outright while keeping Simmons out of the division. No point in involving Toronto."
"If Hield moves, he’ll be the full time SG. There’s a reason they traded for Delon Wright"
"Valancuinas was getting 20 minutes a game that year, he was arguably less impactful than DG was for us this year  Mattisse and Maxey are both on a completely different tier in terms of value than Delon Wright was"
Scraps lmao. Valanciunas was better than Maxey + Thybulle combined and he’s developed even further to become a top 10 center now.   Delon Wright was also a stud for us.   Masai’s asking price was fair given that there were multiple other teams bidding hard for Lowry as well. He would’ve been a needle mover for whatever playoff team he went to. If you want a guy like that you have to mortgage the future.   Simmons doesn’t have teams dying to get him. People think they can but low rn and that’s the only real interest.
"&gt;Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles + picks to get Gasol  The picks were 2nds, so that trade is basically scraps for an upgrade at center   Maxey + Thybulle + Green + 1sts is not at all comparable to the Gasol package"
"Two rookies and a draft pick is not even close to equivalent.   In 2019 Masai gave up Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles + picks to get Gasol even though he was clearly declining. Gasol ended up being a pivotal piece for them and they won a chip. Lowry could’ve been that for Philly, but they weren’t serious about contending."
"Bagley, Delon Wright and #7 for Marcus Smart, Aaron Nesmith, and a future pick."
Correct. Hield's salary is $22.5M and the Lakers are over the cap so they need to send around $18M in a trade. Kuzma is $13.0M.  Is he going to opt in? Seems unlikely to me if he can get $7M anywhere else where he can pick rather than being forced to a team.  Only other way it would work would be adding KCP and Delon Wright to the deal.
"They'd be best off drafting Sengun, moving Hield, Barnes and maybe Delon Wright for more young pieces or picks, and moving forward with a core of Fox, Haliburton and Sengun."
Delon Wright sure did.
I will not HEAR this Derozan/JV/Alfonso McKinnie/CJ Miles/Delon Wright slander sir.
"Yeah, a lot of these rumors and reports are meaningless. If a Kings-Lakers trade would happen, it would be for Delon Wright, not Buddy."
"I think this would have to be a S&amp;T. A couple years ago a lot of RFAs were being S&amp;T to avoid matching. I recall Delon Wright being signed and traded from Memphis to Dallas for 2 seconds, and Brogdon being signed and traded from Milwaukee to Indy for a first or something.  Any amount the Raps offer with cap space would be matched"
"They can move Haliburton to the lineup, Delon Wright trade made it possible."
Haha well he was a frequent starter througout the 2021 season and is still an above average defender. While not a playoff performer I can see a team that hasn't made the playoffs in a while seeing value in him. Which is why I like his fit on the Kings as a competent backup paired with Delon Wright to support a Fox/Haliburton duo. Addition by subtraction for the Kings by trimming Hield who is a great shooter but amplifies the Kings biggest weaknesses.    I'd also say the Pels may just be forced to hang onto his contract or hope for a showcase start of season to flip him at the deadline.
"Yeah, Teague is horrible. That’s another thing as well. Maybe a guy like Delon Wright could me targeted? Trade Brook Lopez to the Kings so Bagley can play the four and they can let Holmes walk if he wants too much money? Plus I’m sure the Bucks could also get either a second for giving up the better player and/or another piece."
"I remember when Raptors won and ex raptors like Jonas, delon Wright who were traded for gasol didn’t get a ring. The raptors asked other organizations that was in the same situation and I guess they told raptors no to giving former players rings when they played parts of the season with the team."
