"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"It's pretty hopeless to make sense of any rotation. Usually the end of the bench guys are vets who can mentor young players but ours are just more young players. I like what I see from McDaniels and Nowell but they probably are the only benefactors of being on such a shit team. In reality, they would probably be playing on two-way contracts for most teams.  Being completely realistic, Jaylen Nowell could not be any more one dimensional. Even on offense without the ball he just stands there. He looks good when he's hitting jumpers but when he's cold he is a complete negative.  Re: Anthony Edwards, I think he's exactly what people scouted and reported him to be: a charismatic athletic guard who can get to the rim and dunk but often has mental lapses and horrible shot selection. I hope he makes improvements but based on recent developments of other players (Culver, Okogie especially) it's hard to really get excited about any future with this team.  It especially sucks to see the roster that Rosas has built knowing he is nearing Kahn levels of winning %, and that we might have drafted the wrong guy (see: LaMelo), and we might be losing our draft pick to the Warriors."
yeah but at least he always brings it on D. If I had to pick one it‚Äôd probably be Jaylen Nowell. he‚Äôs shown have flashes but too many poor decisions and bad shots to go with bad defense as well
Jordan McLaughlin and Jaylen Nowell
"We want to win every game dude.  The only reason multiple guys played 40+ is because our guard rotation was so shallow with  Beasley, D Lo, jaylen nowell and Rubio all out .  Jordan mclaughin normally doesn't play at all"
1. KAT  2. D'lo  3. Beasley  4. Rubio  5. Ant  6. Jaden McDaniels  7. Naz Reid  8. Jaylen Nowell  9. Josh Okogie?
"Whats the alternative? Bench him for jaylen nowell, who will also chuck as much as he wants?"
"Jaden plays for the Wolves, Jalen plays for the Hornets.... Unless you are talking about Jaylen Nowell who plays for the Wolves.... Or if you are talking about the Hornets player but the stupid April Fools day prank is blocking your flair."
"We got Jaylen Nowell and Naz Reid in 2019.  That wasn‚Äôt disappointing even though Culver hasn‚Äôt panned out.  Nowell turned the corner this year, looking great."
"You have very little job security as a second rd pick .  Its not like FVV was turning down some insane amount of money .  For example, if Jaylen Nowell sucked the wolves could let him walk for nothing after this season after not even making 3 mil in his first 2 yrs combined.  Being a second rd pick is only a good thing if you weren't going to be signed as a UDFA .  Otherwise you're better off just going undrafted and picking your situation"
Maclauglin was offered the same deal discussed here.  Naz Reid and Jaylen Nowell are both on the 2mil year non-guaranteed.  JMac thinks he can do better.  Maybe he can.
"But choose to bandwagon the Minneapolis Lakers flair...  Compared to the mess the roster was in when he got here Rosas has done an excellent job and the only glaring mistakes were heading into the season with no starting PF and drafting Culver in 2019 (he can still pan out but its unlikely and he made up for that mistake with Jaylen Nowell,Naz Reid,Jordan McLaughlin and Jaden McDaniels).   Another thing you can blame on him was Ryan but Glenn clearly chose the signing there."
Jaylen Nowell
Jaylen Nowell.
They knew they could resign Jordan McLaughlin at or around the minimum and also had Jaylen Nowell on a 2-way so they had guard options.
"Good. Coby White is a better,more selfish Jaylen Nowell, he can't run an offence."
"[Me](https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/5jY6EPf5MHQ/hqdefault.jpg) when I hear ""Jaylen Nowell"""
jaylen nowell is more of an offensive weapon
Heard of Jaylen Nowell? Book it.
"Even if he is a wing the Wolves still don't have good wing depth and certainly no good 3 and d depth at the wing at all. It's not good trying to figure out if on a night to night basis if Okogie, Culver, Jake Layman, or Jaylen Nowell have to play 20+ minutes a night. With the big position you can get good minutes out of Vando, McDaniels, or Naz playing alongside KAT the same hasn't been true for the wings on the roster where either they're getting lit up by the opponent or are offensively unplayable."
"well it‚Äôs his second second and the first season where he‚Äôs played a significant role. Plus, him seeming better about it this game and it being the first game since Finch had a chance to really work with the team may not be a coincidence.  And as far as Shabazz Muhammad, Jaylen Nowell has far far more potential on offense. Even if Shabazz passed up some more looks, the ball stagnated when he got it so the offense was dead anyways. Nowell has legit gravity on offense and you can see other guys getting open because of it. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to think some more experience at the NBA level would unlock a dangerous offensive against player. But then again there are some guys who never figure out when to shoot and when to pass so who knows"

Jaylen Nowell and Jaden McDaniels 48 points on 19-22 shooting lmao. We‚Äôre coming for that 12 seed üòéüòéüòé
"Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards and Jaylen Nowell are the next NBA big 3"
how bad is the pelicans defense to let jaylen nowell and jaden mcdaniels score 48 on 19-22 shooting
Jaylen Nowell been chuggin Michael's Secret Stuff
Jaylen Nowell is the greatest shooter of all time.
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
Unbiased opinion  MVP - KAT  DPOY - Josh Okogie  ROTY - Anthony Edwards  6MOY - D‚ÄôAngelo Russell (He‚Äôs been coming off the bench for the past few weeks)  MIP - Jaylen Nowell  COTY - Chris Finch  EOTY - Gersson Rosas   What do you guys think?
"&gt;Ant also hasn't been hurting his team to same extent by the on/offs - Wolves are basically even with Ant on the court vs. off it for the season and I think he lately has probably been a clear positive, since the coaching change.  If we forced Jaylen Nowell or Josh Okogie to take the shots Ant has been forced to take we'd be even worse off. Honestly do you even watch the Wolves?"
"Right, in BKN he has ball handlers along side him in Dinwiddie and Levert. We‚Äôve tried that with Rubio and guys like Jordan McLaughlin, Jaylen Nowell, but they all have huge limitations so it‚Äôs never been perfect. It could definitely work with the right pairing."
&gt;Update: in sorry everyone but due to inflammatory and downright repugnant behaviour by u/brolysfavoritenephew the only non Timberwolves jaylen nowell fan will be leaving this subreddit for good. I was an asset to this community and am saddened by these recent developments and you are too. You may take you're frustrations out on said user. Goodbye.    Lol I appreciate the commitment to the bit
The golden boy of r/nba is me and I'm getting pretty tired of it. I'm just your regular jaylen nowell fan stop treating me like some god who can do no wrong the top 5 posts on the front page right now are about me its insane
His defense in that  2 -3 zone was actually insane. Would get blocks nonstop. Man that team was fun to watch with Jaylen Nowell too.
Unbiased take:  1. Malik Beasley 2. Anthony Edwards 3. Jaylen Nowell 4. Zach LaVine 5. Malik Beasley again
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- ‚Äî Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother‚Äôs death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  ‚ÄúThis win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,‚Äù Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt deserve to win,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúWhenever we take these teams lightly, we don‚Äôt do what we‚Äôre supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It‚Äôs not good basketball.‚Äù  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West‚Äôs worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn‚Äôt let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  ‚ÄúTough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,‚Äù Wolves coach Chris Finch said. ‚ÄúTotal team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.‚Äù  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs tough to overcome,‚Äù Spoelstra said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.‚Äù  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame ‚ÄúWith Liberty and Justice FOR ALL‚Äù warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks ‚Äì the previous two teams to play in Minnesota ‚Äì along with the WNBA‚Äôs Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves‚Äô website during Friday‚Äôs game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
"Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, and Jaden McDaniels are three guys who are regular staples of the rotation now that really only got their run because of injuries (Naz probably would've gotten some regardless, but the other 2 only got some because of injury/absences), and have kind of proven to us how disposable some of these middle of the rotation guys (Juancho, Layman, Vanderbilt, Culver) will be in the offseason"
Smh the Jaylen Nowell disrespect. He was sent too.
"Dlo: ""Look jaylen, they appear to be playing *harder* than they did in the regular season!""  *Jaylen Nowell produces pen&amp;paper and quickly jots that down*"
Part of me just wonders if D‚ÄôLo wanted to go to watch a game and support Booker and the org was like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll comp your tickets if Jaylen Nowell can tag along and watch with you.‚Äù
[Jaylen Nowell posted an ig story from that game. Can confirm that happened.](https://np.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/njibm4/our_boy_jaylen_at_the_suns_game/)
[Jaylen Nowell posted an ig story from that game. Can confirm that happened.](https://np.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/njibm4/our_boy_jaylen_at_the_suns_game/)
Our 2nd round pick Jaylen Nowell would go before Jarret Culver. Honestly Culver ain‚Äôt getting draft after what he has shown.
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"I watched all of his games in Timberwolves uniform. Culver does not possess even one good NBA quality. He cannot shoot (even FT), cannot consistently finish through contact, not a good playmaker, may be decent (??) cutter. His defense is fine but not something extraordinary. About success in tanking teams - despite being one of the worst teams last 2 seasons Timberwolves never tanked. Started last season 10-7 and tried to win games after Dlo trade, this season everyone was injured (chance for Culver to step up) and eventually the team started to play well with Culver out of rotation.  Edit: Culver has had tons of chances. We tried him as primary PG, SG next to ball handler, SF, he even played 4. He was a starter, bench player, everyone. Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels and even Jaylen Nowell somehow used their chances and became consistent rotational players. Culver is literally the worst player in Timberwolves right now."
Jaylen Nowell too
"Three or four team trade where Minnesota includes rubio, beas, and some combo of naz reid, culver, jaylen nowell, and/or mcdaniels plus a first or two. This could be in a Lowry sign and trade or with various other teams moving on from a player Philly might be more interested in."
Believe me I KNOW its not great. That why I said its so easily beatable. The only way it gets done is if theres a 3rd team for you to move Rubio and a pick to. Like a Lowry.  Beasley + Lowry + a pick + say Jaylen Nowell isnt AWFUL but its still definitely beatable
"They need some PG laeding the team, a solid, established court general, someone like maybe Ricky Rubio. They also need some surefire offense, which they heavily lacked outside of Embiid, so a good cheap lights out shooter, like Beasley would be really good.  And maybe a promising young aspect to carry on, like Jarrett Culver or Jaylen Nowell.   Huh, thats weird, they're all on the same team."
"Malik Beasley, Jaylen Nowell, Culver + a future first"
"i'd love to see d'lo and dinwiddie play together again, but we really don't need morw guards tbh.  we have d'lo, rubio, beasley, ant, jaylen nowell, jordan mclaughlin, and then leandro bolmaro seems like he's coming over from barca for next season"
Jaylen Nowell or Ben Simmons?
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
Na his defence is still fine. And he can playmake a bit. But he was a black hole on offence.  At the end of the day he was completely redundant to us when Josh Okogie and to an extent Jarred Vanderbilt do the exact same things as Culver but better. We couldnt have 4 bench guys all incapable of scoring. And thats why Jaden McDaniels and Jaylen Nowell both got chances ahead of him
"Jayden McDaniels, Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, and Naz Reid tell a different story.   Four players who‚Äôve developed to be better than Culver has been playing. If Culver still has a higher ceiling than those four, it‚Äôs no longer the Wolves fault he‚Äôs not playing better than any of them."
"No team hits on all their picks. Rosas drafted Culver, Jaylen Nowell, ANT, Leandro Balmaro, and Jaden McDaniels. picked up Naz Reid as a rookie FA signing. Only 1 of those players looks like a wasted pick so far. Jaden is out playing his draft position and ANT is everything that could be expected of a #1 pick."
"There‚Äôs a Jaylen Adam‚Äôs on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate. That‚Äôs just in the summer league. In the nba, there is also Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson."
"There‚Äôs a Jaylen Adam‚Äôs on the bulls and a Jalen Adams on the raptors. Jalen Crutcher, Jalen Green, Jaylen Hands, Jaylen Hoard, Jalen Johnson, Jalen Lecque, Jaylen Nowell, Jalen Smith, Jaleen smith (not a typo), Jalen Suggs, Jalen Tate. That‚Äôs just in the summer league. I‚Äôm the nba, there is also Jaylen Brown, Jalen Brunson."
Well that was fucking fun wasnt it? Jaylen Nowell hit some crazy ass shots. The pace and space team ball was amazing to watch. And the defence in this and the Chicago game were absolutely stellar. Very very impressed.  If I HAD to make criticisms it would be that we still kinda pulled into the middle giving up some open 3s and Nathan Knight wasnt as physically imposing as I had hoped. But damn that was nice
Jaylen Brown  Jaylen Nowell  Jalen Johnson   Jalen McDaniels  Jalen Brunson  Jalen Smith  Jaylen Hoard  There‚Äôs also 2-3 other Jalens/Jaylens who are young UFAs
Jaylen Nowell
I think the plan is to play Jaylen Nowell at backup pg
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
London Perrantes but no Jaylen Nowell?
"If Jaylen Nowell or Taurean Prince get hurt, Timberwolves don't make the finals."
"We have Malik Beasley, Okogie, and Jaylen Nowell as well. Beasley is a fantastic shooter and Jaylen is proving he deserves minutes - Okogie is just a defense guy, but what I‚Äôm trying to say is there are only so many minutes to go around at the 2 spot."
"funny enough, if we trade rubio and don't sign another PG, a second round pick will probably be our backup PG, Jaylen Nowell, our 2nd round pick from 2019, got run as the backup PG for an 8 game stretch this year. (And had some really good games, [this one against the pelicans being the biggest highlight](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202103110NOP.html), though he played solid over the 8 game stretch from this pelicans game thru our game against dallas)"
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don‚Äôt really count it."
"Culver is the only pick their new regime has blew lmao they‚Äôre 4/5 which is a great hit rate. Drafted Naz reid Jaylen nowell Edwards and McDaniels. Malik Beasley is already out of prison he was only there a couple weeks (and it was the offseason). Trading for dlo was good b/c their FO got rid of Wiggins. He‚Äôs just been injured which is bad luck and happens. They have a winning record when dlo and kat play. Also their FO Is pretty good, they got rid of dieng Wiggins Teague contracts in one season (nobody thought they could get rid of either and that it would take numerous first round picks attached)."
I know its minor but Naz Reid and Jaylen Nowell really improved since they came to the Wolves. I know everyone is gonna make fun of the Wolves and our misses (when we miss boy do we miss) but I think our training staff does a good job.   There is also pre ASB Edwards and post ASB which was a drastic improvement.
Jaylen Nowell is averaging 25 points per 36 through 1 game
"I was pissed when we picked him. I wanted Coby White. We had 2 years hearing about how much of a work ethic he had. But seemed to do him no good. No improvement at all over the 2 years.  You can go ""lolwolves"" over it but we turned Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell and Jordan McLaughlin into legit rotational pieces in the same time period. Dude just straight up sucked"
"Speaking solely from the Wolves perspective. Naz Reid has looked good, Jaylen Nowell looked solid last night and Anthony Edwards took a huge leap defensively"
Jaylen Nowell against the Pels last year.
I'm gonna say it because nobody else had. Jaylen Nowell
"Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and Markelle Fultz  Magic get: Patrick Beverley and Jaylen Nowell  I am not even going to pretend I‚Äôve watched half these players and just matched money for ‚Äúlol Fultz back to 76ers‚Äù  Who even would win this trade?"
"Ok so let‚Äôs just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that‚Äôs hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You‚Äôd have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there‚Äôs no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you‚Äôd be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I‚Äôd be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I‚Äôd still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
The game that best showcased his defense was the against Washington.  He absolutely shut down Jaylen Nowell.
"Playing for wins against tanking teams last year in an effort to establish a ""winning culture"" screwed us for the draft (thanks Gerson...you couldn't at least have done a pick swap instead of sending a 1st and Wigs for D'lo?) and probably f-ed our timing with Ant.  Put Evan Mobley on this team and maybe you have something. I love KAT, but it's time to move on if they can get some decent assets (a couple of young and decent players - Allen and Garland? and pick or pick swap) and tank the rest of the year playing the kids (Ant, JMac, Bolmero, Jaylen Nowell \[why can't this guy get any run?\]) for the homegrown (rhymes with Holmgren) savior."
