"So outside of the obvious guys that will still see a lot of play (KD, Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Brown), it boils down to whether or not it's possible that Blake ends up being better than any of these guys:  -DJ: 22mpg  -Jeff Green: 26mpg  -Landry Shamet: 20mpg  -TLC: 20mpg  -Claxton: 15mpg  Some of this comes down to the matchups(Claxton and DJ) but I can realistically see Blake getting a decent chunk of the Shamet/TLC minutes, or at least Nash experimenting with that.   It's a low risk/potentially solid reward move. There's very little downside since he's on a vet min contract and even though he's having a bad year right now, I think he's still probably a better overall player compared to TLC/Shamet.  He's a pretty good passer/playmaker, so having another one of those in the second unit alongside Harden (mostly to punish double teams) is going to be really helpful.    It also lets them play a little bigger when they are still playing small."
Dipo can’t even create separation against Landry Shamet anymore dude is done
"The Star power is the most important thing at all , and the role players are pretty even , all they need the nets from role players are just Scrubs that can hit shots like TLC or shamet and they got them, the Lakers role players can't hit a shot to save their life, best Lakers shooter is KCP and nets 6th best shooter is Landry shamet"
"its a 3 way tie between DeAndre, TLC and Landry Shamet"
"I know Steve Kerr was a solid role player, but naming your kid after him? A tad surprising. It’s like naming your kid after Landry Shamet lol."
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he’s taken some spectacular leaps)  I’d say the last few years we’ve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I’d say we’ve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."

"I said Philly has better trade options than the clippers and Toronto you must have misunderstood what I said. And again the clippers do have draft picks if y’all just looked it up you would see they got 4 picks back in the trade for Kennard. Wether u want to say second round picks are good or not is a different thing, but they have picks.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2918739-report-landry-shamet-traded-to-nets-luke-kennard-to-clippers-in-3-team-deal.amp.html"
"Luckily Harden is easily the 2nd best floor raiser in the league. Look at how much better the role players are playing post Harden trade. No hate to any of these guys but a month ago would u really believe Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and a 300 year old Jeff Green who looked like a shell of himself were gonna play important playoff and probably even finals minutes?"
They could have kept him if they never traded for landry shamet lmao
Mark Jones called Shamet Landry Fields by accident
Landry Shamet***** Landry fields is the assistant GM in Atlanta
"That and taking Uncle Jeff out of the game. They had no answer for our small ball death lineup.  Instead we had to put in Landry Shamet.   Realistically though, with KD this is a 20 pt blowout anyway."
Need a landry shamet dagger lmfaoo
landry shamet career clipper highlights: scoring multiple 3s in his first game with us to help beat the celtics; scoring the game-winning 3 to finish our comeback against the warriors; maybe letting us beat the nets????
honestly fuck Landry Shamet. This is all his fault. Fucking pulled up for a 3 on a fast break up 94-79. Slow the fuck down and give Harden the ball you colossal shithead
When Landry Shamet didn't even know his teammates that were passing him the ball.
Same here with landry shamet and deandre jordan
Landry Shamet iso our best chance lol
"Yes, Bruce brown, Jeff green and Landry shamet are all playing"
"What a dumb fucking comment. He has Landry Shamet, future HOFer who’s about to torch Lebum and the Lakers"
Aplogize to Brand right now.  Starting with you Sixer fans.  Would you rather have Landry Shamet right now or Tobi?
A week ago I would have said Landry Shamet but he’s been pretty decent lately.. so I have to say TLC. We’ll have to see if Shamet can keep it up tho
"Pretty solid to close, Suns didn’t really use Ayton to the fullest though, and he’s not very aggressive. There were times were he was guarded by like Landry Shamet and didn’t get the ball, or had to pass out from hard doubles.   If he was more assertive and physical they could’ve closed the game earlier just getting him to the line. My take away is that he needs to step up in that regard to fully realize this Sun’s team potential.   This game isn’t on him completely but just speaking about the larger picture. Suns took their foot off the gas and the Nets bench players started draining shots."
it's mind boggling how smaller players like Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson is capable of stopping Ayton in the paint
"He looked at that fourth quarter lineup of Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and Tyler Johnson and thought, ""Huh, this feels familiar..."""
"This team just shot 57% from the field and 50% from 3, without KD and Kyrie... That's INSANE!   The next best players after Harden are Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet... LMAOOO   This team's offensive ability might go down in history as an all-time best"
"That's understandable, but Jeff Green, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson killed them too"
Landry Shamet sighting
Landry Shamet with the stop
Tyler Johnson and Landry Shamet playing a big part in it too lol who woulda thought
Landry Shamet with the clamps on Booker to ice the game. Never would have thought I would see the day
"I cannot believe we just won this game. So proud of this squad.  Harden was incredible as usual, but Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green and Landry Shamet stepped up big time. 26 point comeback. Amazing."
Booker got clamped by Landry fucking Shamet LOL
DPOY landry shamet
Don’t try to body Landry Shamet
Landry Shamet
"What happened to Landry ""God"" Shamet?"
landry shamet you sinestro lookin motherfucker
"Kyrie, Shamet, TLC, meth curry. Bunch of no muscle midgets who can't guard a traffic cone.   Fucking marks. Would it kill you to get a 3 or 4 with some actual size. Nah let's trade saddiq hey for landry fucking Shamet. Good lord."
"Curious what your standards are. The guy who traded for him was fired soon after. He never provided meaningful value on the basketball court and now he’s is by far the worst contract in the league. They gave up tobias Harris (later traded for Landry shamet, 2 firsts and 2 seconds), a first, and a second for him.   It would’ve worked out better for them if they would’ve cut tobias and got caught cheating the salary cap and lost those picks lol. Atleast then they wouldn’t have his albatross."

They have a few tiny contracts they can couple. Maybe throw in a 2nd rounder depending on who they put together:  Shamet + Tyler Johnson  Tyler Johnson + Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot  Tyler Johnson + Shumpert + 2nd rounder  Tyler Johnson + Noah Vonleh + 2nd rounder  Shamet + Noah Vonleh  Basically any combo that involves either Tyler Johnson or Landry Shamet will work. These are the most likely options imo.
"JJ Redick and Seth Curry and Landry Shamet aren't Steph either, but they all work hard enough off the ball to be actual NBA players. They don't demand to run the team's whole offense like Jimmer does."
Landry Shamet looks like a completely different player compared to his rookie season.
Nothing more disrespectful than Draymond looking at you and deciding he needs to go get his own offense and get to the rim if your Landry Shamet lmao
For Landry Shamet LMFAAOOOOOOOO
We really gave up our pick in exchange for Landry Shamet and then the pick turned out to be what we hoped Landry Shamet would be (and then some) in Saddiq Bey
Gave up this guy for Landry fucking Shamet. Makes my blood boil
It would be weird even if this was some random guy like idk Landry Shamet getting dunked on. Why bring up a 4 year old highlight that has no relevance to anything today?
yeah Bey looked pretty good out there. I’m still salty we traded our pick (for landry shamet of all people) instead of drafting Saddiq or Precious.
3 team trade where OKC gets Spencer Dinwiddie Landry Shamet and matching salary BKN gets al horford and the 3rd team is for salary filler to get OKC enough $$
We love our young guys. Posting memes about landry shamet on the sub til this day.       I dont give a fuck tho any of our youngings are on the trading block to bring lowery home
I think the semi realistic dream is scour the market for a 3rd team to see if you can come up with a viable partner to make a Spencer dinwiddie Landry Shamet Nic Claxton for Al Horford framework work. You need more matching $$ which is why I said 3rd team but if you can find it that’s the one I think is a difference maker. I don’t see OKC doing this if you make them take back DeAndre since Horford is only partially guaranteed his last year
With Harris he’s 29 but he’s also the type of player who’ll age well. JJ Redick was able to bring it at about the same level until he was 34-35. Harris has more size so he might be able to age better defensively he may very well have like 5 years left of being roughly this player. I don’t think Cleveland would do it Nance is pretty valuable but if I were to get an extra first yeah I would   I think the real dream for BK which might be somewhat viable is scour the market for a 3rd team to make salaries match where you can give OKC Dinwiddie’s expiring Landry Shamet and whatever else to match from another team for al horford. That’s the one if you can drop al horford on this roster even at age 35 I would be really in on even if his contract sucks
"No, I am not saying casual fans have no grasp of the sport, rather, I am saying that casual fans don't care about whether someone accidentally calls Landry Shamet ""Chris Chiozza"".   If the announcers are out here calling LeBron James ""Joel Embiid"" then sure it's an issue but Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza nobody cares."
"Yes, I read the article.   I think you are grossly overestimating what a casual fan cares about. No casual fan gives a damn about DeMarre Carroll vs. Jarrett Allen or Chris Chiozza vs. Landry Shamet. Those might as well be computer generated names for all they know.  It's about atmosphere, stars and nostalgia."
Jeff Green and Landry Shamet keeping LA in it
Landry shamet is terrible
#LANDRY SHAMET IS ASS
Ok so what happened to Landry Shamet?
Landry Shamet: The Kawhi Leonard stopper
The Landry Shamet game
Pleasant: Jeff Green  Unpleasant: Landry Shamet
"The Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. It takes time to improve defensively. The Brooklyn Nets are also playing Timothé Luwawu-Clown, Landry Shamet and Reggie Perry. I’m not sure they belong in the NBA, but the Brooklyn Nets will pick up better players and shorten the rotation come playoff time. The Brooklyn Nets are fine.   Timothé Luwawu-Clown makes me sick."
Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot makes me sick. Reggie Perry makes me sick. Landry Shamet makes me sick. Tyler Johnson makes me sick.
best i can do is landry shamet and a junior’s cheesecake
Landry Shamet has been so bad that he is now out of the rotation on a team that is playing Reggie Perry meaningful minutes. Wild how the Clippers got Kennard and 4 unprotected seconds for him.
Landry Shamet has been so bad that he is now out of the rotation on a team that is playing Reggie Perry meaningful minutes. Wild how the Clippers got Kennard and 4 unprotected seconds for him.
"It’s the regular season every team is  deep enough to play 10 guys. You’re not asking your 10th man to ball out you just need guys to give you a breather. Ie ‘Wesley okondwu” played 5 minutes for Dallas tonight. 10th man  Or if not at least your 9th man plays 10+ minutes. Nets are only playing 9 and that 9th guy played 5 minutes. In an overtime game. They’re almost playing 8  Sure some games you may only play 9 but they literally have not played more then 9 since signing harden. What makes it even worse is Tyler Johnson and landry Shamet are at least league average players . Other teams fill that 10th, 11th man role with guys who are barely in the league"
"That's the thing, Shamet was a huge exception.  Top 3 3PM for rookies in 17-18:  1. Donovan Mitchell  2. Kyle Kuzma  3. Lauri Markkanen  18-19:  1. Luka Doncic  2. Landry Shamet  3. Trae Young  19-20:  1. Coby White  2. Kendrick Nunn  They're all volume shooter iso players besides Shamet. 3pt specialists just don't get that many shots as rookies."
Landry Shamet.
Lmao we played Chris Chiozza and Landry Shamet 20+ minutes that's not called depth bud. The Sixers aren't doing jack shit this year.
Landry Shamet is really good just young
"Landry Shamet went 0/6 and was +6, your point?"
Ya I really don't understand how this is even a debate. Kyrie/Harden/AD with guys like KCP/Schroeder/Harrell/Kuzma off the bench is far superior to LeBron/KD/Joe Harris and guys like Jeff Green/ TLC/ and Landry Shamet..
Landry Shamet for Bamba and a couple of 2nd round picks
"I really like Landry Shamet too, sucks to see him struggle like this."
"**Fucking cheeks, landry shamet is.**    *-DopeMan93*"
Landry Shamet is fucking cheeks
Landry Shamet for a half eaten jar of pickles
How you gonna get blocked by Landry Shamet
"Honestly, I don't know any of the guys on Brooklyn's bench aside from Landry Shamet."
"&gt;the Rockets didn’t take any of those players   you’re missing the point, **the Nets don’t have those players any longer** and they traded their 2020 1st for Landry Shamet, Nets don’t have a future past 2023(if their stars dont leave in the 2022 offseason first)  no one is valuing the Lakers 2021-2024 picks highly because they have AD over that time frame still in his prime  completely different futures, Lakers at worst mid but likely pretty good, Nets future success is banking on old KD and relatively old Harden(given how he treats his body)"
"James Harden is a good defender.   Kyrie Irving, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet are terrible defenders though. Landry Shamet wasn’t part of the rotation today and I hope Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Reggie Perry aren’t part of the rotation soon.   Jarrett Allen was a big loss, but the Brooklyn Nets defense will be good. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"Of course they lost, if Landry Shamet plays 0 minutes, what do you expect?"
My thoughts as well. I completely forgot he was out until like the 2nd quarter. I'm surprised Landry Shamet didn't get any playing time
Media clown with a clown take. The Brooklyn Nets will get stops when Landry Shamet and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot aren’t part of the rotation anymore.  The league is Brooklyn’s for the next 3-5 years.
and start average man's Landry Shamet
Oh wow. The Brooklyn Nets only blow leads when Landry Shamet and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot are on the court.  The Brooklyn Nets have a 7-0 record this season when going into the 4th quarter with a lead.
Use him as a rich man's Landry Shamet lol

"Can only speak for the Nets because I don't know the bucks roster that well, but the have kd, kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ, Jeff Green, TLC (luwawu cabbarot, no idea how to spell it lol), Bruce brown and Landry shamet as solid rotation pieces. However u slice it, they have 3 solid players coming off the bench imo. They're real weakness is bigs for defense and rebounding, which they desperately need. With how well they shot this game, it should not have come down to the last possession."
Basically the Milwaukee version of Landry Shamet
Yea like if you think about just pure basketball reasons every minute he's on the floor Landry Shamet isn't haha
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
I’ve watched a few games where Landry waives his arms for 5 seconds and no one will pass him the ball. The Nets have some guys that have decided to shoot every chance they get now that their touches are down.   This style of play kills shooters like Landry Shamet.
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
Just waiting for Landry Shamet to blossom into Reggie Miller Jr.   Any day now...
He looks better than Shamet so far. Landry has been pretty bad
"Teams with depth don’t beat teams with superstars in the playoffs in the NBA. It’s not football where the 53rd man muffing a punt or unable to be a good long snapper can lose the game.   Even if we play your game and pretend the 6th man matters as much as Tatum vs KD, you’re severely underrating the Nets depth. No team has a fourth option as good as Joe Harris and Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet are productive solid NBA options as well. TLC and Chiozza are no different from DiVincenzo/Nunn. You just started with the conclusion the Nets suck, and are grasping at straws to figure out why."
"I quickly want to question their depth, but if healthy, they're fine. The wing defense will be the main question but a supporting cast around those main 3 of DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and (when healthy) Spencer Dinwiddie isn't that bad. Fit wise it is a bit weird though"
"Let's also not forget that our depth before the Harden trade and Dinwiddie injury was by far the best in the league. After, we still have some depth. Joe Harris is lethal, Jeff Green and Bruce Brown are productive on offense and valuable defenders, Landry Shamet hasn't been great so far but can shoot the lights out at times, and Nic Claxton will be getting minutes when he gets healthy and I'm fairly certain he will be surprising a lot of people with his play."
Landry Shamet
"Honestly, drafting players you naturally feel attached. I still am like that with Blake and DJ. And Shai will always be my son. And Jerome Robinson and Landry Shamet are my two much uglier sons"
"Landry Shamet  I think he was supposed to be pretty solid, at worst a good three-point specialist, but he's kind of just sucked."
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
Don’t sleep on Nicolas Claxton. I just hope Steve Nash plays him when he is available. Never know with a coach that gives Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Landry Shamet too much playing time.   The Charlotte Hornets are lacking a big man though.
I thought Shamet would make the jump and look like Shai-Gilgeous  but so far he's looking like Landry Shamet
Landry Shamet to Cavs for Mcgee and a 2nd?
"&gt;ESPN: James Harden ~~buys~~ gives Landry Shamet a lap dance to regain his old number  Harden’s thicc these days, so he’ll do it himself."
James harden also gives Landry shamet his starting position and his yearly pass for free McDonald meals for his old number
ESPN: James Harden buys Landry Shamet a lap dance to regain his old number
"Carlos Tevez went AWOL for six months and welcomed back with little ramifications. If one of the better players in European football did this, they'd at worst be put on the market to be sold. Man United won't terminate Harry Maguire's contact if he did this. Thats just how life is when you're at the top of your profession and it's not fair but that's how it is. If Landry Shamet did this, the Nets would be nowhere near as patient and if the guy who cleaned the locker rooms did this, they'd be fired instantly. To follow on from the NFL example made, how many chances did Antonio Brown get before people decided to steer clear? The backup kicker won't get as much leeway. People can say all they want about silver or the NBA being soft or what David Stern would have done but there are different rules for someone like Kyrie and you see it everywhere in life."
This Brooklyn team could struggle in a Covid world especially if the playoffs are played in this environment. Kyrie doing whatever he wants and I can't trust James Harden either.. KD could be out here on an island with Landry shamet if shit hits the fan in the playoffs
Landry Shamet looks like trae young’s cousin
"Implying Landry ""Already part of his 3rd superteam"" Shamet isn't the adult in the locker room"
NBA trades are so complicated. I was looking through basketballreference last night and found out that technically Landry Shamet was part of the 2012 trade that sent Andrew Bynum to Philadelphia. Shamet was 15 years old at the time.
Uhhh Landry shamet???
If my cousin was Landry Shamet I would make sure he got me a KD jersey.
"Landry Shamet was raised by a single mother, but grand parents?  Aunts?  Uncles?  Nephews?  If my cousin were in the NBA I'd def buy a jersey!"
"My turn your turn works well with 2 (eg Lebron-Kyrie) but with 3, the 3rd guy is going to become a spacer/kick out 3 guy.  I think it would work somewhat with Kyrie and Harden as the 2 main ball handlers and KD as the open shooter.  KD shooting open catch and shoot 3s is pretty deadly but it's not going to be the full sum of the parts.  I imagine a lot of teams are going to try and force Joe Harris and the 5th guy (Landry Shamet?) to beat them"
"No, it's clearly Landry Shamet."
hey harden i know you just spent months trying to get here but were going to need you to come off the bench behind landry shamet k thx
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Landry Shamet is mid, Bruce Brown tho 👀👀👀👀"
Landry Shamet sucks and shouldnt get playing time. Bruce Brown is way better
"Jeez, how much help does Landry Shamet need?"
Landry shamet?
What number will Harden wear on the Nets now that Landry Shamet wearing #13?
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Nets would abuse the ultra big lakers lineups. Lakers I think would have to play AD at the 5. I think montrez and gasol would be borderline unplayable for long stretches against the nets   Lakers have better chemistry but the nets do have some solid role guys still there in joe Harris Landry shamet and Bruce brown. I think they also still have Jeff green who can do some stuff
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
Stop spreading fake news. Jamal Murray got hot when Landry Shamet was guarding him. Bruce Brown put clamps on him.   Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. He will never be an all star or win a championship in his career.
No he isn’t. All his buckets were against Landry Shamet. Bruce Brown put clamps on him. I’d rather have Bruce Brown than Jamal Murray on a championship team.  Jamal Murray is the most overrated borderline all star in the league. I predict he will never be an all star in his career or win a championship unless he plays 4th fiddle on a Kevin Durant team.
Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet were indeed the pieces to elevate you guys to contender
"Some guys have to learn how to get a rythm without getting dribbles and shots... each situation landry became more and more of a specialist, and IMO on a team with divas like Kawhi and PG, or even Embiid and Simmons early on, he doesnt have much margin for error before guys like kyrie start askin why hes on the floor to begin with.. like duncan robinson not doin shit if hes not bustin treys.. if he hits a slump like shamet, he'll be in the same boat... confidence is key for specialists.."
landry shamet needs to not be on the floor. Like ever
Now theyre saying its Landry Shamet
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
"Marv Albert could'nt differentiate between Landry Shamet and Chris Chiozza all game, and Weber called Prince Demarre Carroll about 8 times. Horrible announcing."
TIL Chris Chiozza is actually Landry Shamet
We gave up a first round pick for Landry Shamet 🤦‍♂️
Shake Milton is who Landry Shamet thinks he is
"No, but he thinks every light skinned black guy is Landry Shamet."
Landry Shamet fucking sucks.
Some Albert/Webber to English translations:  Chris Chiozza = Landry Shamet  Tyrese Maxey = Shake Milton  Taurean Prince = Deandre Jordan
Landry Shamet 2.0
"What about joe Harris, caris levert, and Landry shamet?"
"Wow, Landry Shamet lost his spot to Tyler Johnson? Oof"
Clippers should've kept Landry Shamet for times like this. He would be a perfect throw in guy for a Lowry trade
Landry Shamet
"There were some dumb takes but this level of fun is more than even I expected. Outside of the stars, guys like Joe Harris, Landry Shamet always keep the ball moving and fly off screens. Jeff Green just does everything and never forces it. Blake is a really good passer. Him and LMA bring some post up punch to the team. Claxton's a big ball of energy. Basically everything you'd want in an ideal offense. It's not just 3-4 guys standing around.   This is like D'Antoni's dream."
"OP listed Bruce Brown, Nicolas Claxton and Landry Shamet for the nets lol  Rambis was a solid enough role player"
He’d still lose the NBA’s Casey-Neistat-Lookalike Contest to Landry Shamet though
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
"Yes.   Harden with a Top 10 defense with great wing defenders would be enough as his playmaking ability makes G-league players into key contributors. He's made Bruce Brown, TLC and Landry Shamet play some of the best ball in his career from the moment he's stepped on the team  No disrespect to Steph. Harden is just a better floor raiser while Curry is a better ceiling raiser. Not to imply that Harden isn't a great ceiling raiser and Curry isn't a great ceiling raiser; it's just that each of them have their own respective strengths, and this is Harden's."
"As much as the Nets are easiest road shits for Harden, LMA, and Blake, you have to give them credit for pick ups like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, and Jeff Green."
How much help does Landry Shamet need??
"Yes, it happens a ton and it has happened for years. The person you're taking the number from generally has to be a relatively unknown player where there aren't thousands and thousands of unsold jerseys of that player out there in the world.  Another example is Landry Shamet, it has happened to him twice. When Jimmy Butler came to Philly, Jimmy took Shamet's number 23 and Shamet switched to 5. When James Harden came to Brooklyn, Harden took Shamet's number 13 and switched to 20.  Edit: Derrick Jones Jr. just switched his number mid-season from #55 to #5. Rodney Hood had previously worn #5 but when he got traded away, Jones was allowed to switch to #5."
"Long time first time wassup? I can set aside the sports rivalry for a minute to recognize another team losing their home grown boys. I can't imagine if Philly won a ring with Robert Covington, TJ McConnell, Landry Shamet, etc how I'd feel if they had to leave after."
All this to beat Landry Shamet
"The Nets have the NBA’s second-best record and second-best offense since landing James Harden. They’ve managed this despite Kevin Durant missing 24 games in that span, Kyrie Irving missing nine, and Steve Nash’s coaching staff having to cobble together a back half of the rotation reliant on up-and-down performers like Landry Shamet, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot, and Tyler Johnson. Harden has still managed to thrive despite the roster instability, leading the league in minutes and assists while also averaging 26 points and nine rebounds per game to keep Brooklyn surging. -Dan Devine"
"How did LA get worse?  They were barely a first year team last year, no first year teams win.  We were literally starting Landry Shamet too &amp; Doc was playing Shamet-Lou-Jackson and Harrell.    Mann, Rondo, Batum, Ibaka, Kennard are all serious upgrades over Harrell, Lou, Shamet, etc.  And they shed the coach known for blowing more 3-1 leads than any coach in NBA history."
They got a huge starting centre upgrade with serge ibaka   They got a huge upgrade from Landry shamet to Luke Kennard  And they have a play off upgrade from lou Williams to rajon rondo   PG has also been playing amazing  Saying the clippers are the same is a casual take
Yep. Harris is good (he would start anywhere). Claxton looks good and might in fact just be good (kind of too soon to say). Landry Shamet and Bruce Brown ain’t bad either.
"Again, saying that Hill will have a more difficult time guarding Landry Shamet than JAMES FUCKING HARDEN tells me everything I need to know about how little you actually know about the game of basketball. Also I said that Hill won't be taking Shake's **ROLE** not minutes. Maybe learn to read instead of just making shit up to argue about.  Also please bring up those receipts. I'll be waiting patiently..."
"Sure, but how are you going to stop Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet?"
Landry Shamet is remembering how to play basketball and it's fucking beautiful. This teams gonna be insane once the whole crew is put together.
"&gt;Durant - 29/7.3/5.3 on 65.2%TS (5.4 BPM)  Durant has played 18 games this season. James Harden has played more games as a Net than Kevin Durant.  &gt;Harden also has Harris who is averaging 15ppg on 70%TS and shooting the three at a 50% clip  I mean, you can look at the stats of DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Tyler Johnson before and after the Harden trade. All of those players have had an insane jump in offensive production. In fact, Nick Claxton has more than doubled his production with only 3 additional minutes played compared to last season.   Everyone thought the Nets depleted their depth for Harden but anyone who watches the game can see Harden is getting the most out of everyone. Guys that were 3rd string are now quality contributors. That's a pretty clear definition of an MVP."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson

Landry Shamet showed up
Everyone: bullying doesn’t work  Nets fans: did you see Landry shamet tonight
"Harden has an off night, Kyrie takes over   oh and Landry Shamet wtf ?"
"Landry Shamet, Meth Curry, Bruce Brown and Jeff Green like Voltron  right now providing the offense that KD will provide when he returns. Ridiculous."
landry shamet catch and shoot god.
It’s hilarious how every team that plays the nets instantly decides Landry Shamet is the guy they have to pick on and go after repeatedly
Landry Shamet trying to save his whole career tonight
Me and my friends call Landry Shamet “Dirty Landry” as in dirty laundry. Could make for some great calls if announcers ever used it lol.   “Dirty Landry straight to the hamper with the and one!!!”
"Nets don’t really have “scraps” though. They basically gave a six man and their starting big and a tonne of picks. Before the harden trade they were arguably the deepest team in the league. Outside of the big 3 they still have one of the best shooters in the nba (Joe Harris), a decent veteran forward (Jeff Green), Bruce Brown who’s been a really good two way do it all player, a very promising young big who can switch onto guards in Claxton and the washed up corpse of Deandre and Landry Shamet who kinda sucks now.   And this is all with the extremely untimely injury of Dinwiddie.   The only thing they lack is a big body inside for AD and Embiid every other team they can smoke pretty easily."
"Laker fans love to keep citing the fact that they were the 4th seed, without bringing up that there was a 3-way tie at the time with the Clippers and I think the Blazers, while the Rockets and the Jazz (easily playoff teams) were still struggling in the beginning of their season and not in the top 8.  Not to mention, right when Lebron said ""playoff mode activated"" there was a stint where Ingram was showing his true potential, but they still dropped like 2-3 games to a shitty Hawks and Pelicans team (with AD not playing) and fell further in the standings behind the Clippers at the time.  There's a lot of excuses to be made, but the fact is the Lakers just couldn't get it done. I mean everyone thought the Lakers would catch the Clippers since the Clippers traded their best player at the time for picks and Landry Shamet to Philly, but the Lakers still couldn't close"

Landry Michael Shamet
James Harden - Back  Landry Shamet - Slump busted  Nicolas Claxton - Fucking beast  Patty Mills - Nets Killer  Our Defensive Rebounding - Trash  Our Defense Against 3rd Stringers - Still Trash  Game Over - W!!!!!
"Nets are starting: Mike James, Landry Shamet, KD, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin.    1st of all, ew   2nd of all... 6MOTY HARDEN IS BACK"
"Probably someone who can shoot really well. Those days were so reliant on paint scoring and paint protectors that adding a guy who could score 3s on high volume at a 40% rate would be the best scorer in the league and open the floor for others. Maybe like Landry Shamet or something  edit: nvm I just realized you said 60s and I don't think the 3 pt line existed then? probably some really long/athletic big man then like Mo Bamba, bonus that you can shoot the jumper a bit. maybe Gorgui Dieng"
tbf they did manage to swindle Detroit out of a bunch of early 2nds for Landry Shamet or whoever they sent.  But yeah any time early 2nds are your best trade assets....
Landry Shamet is good enough to be a starter
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"He averages 6 assists for a score first mentality type of guard. I don't think it gets better than that, Kyrie is a pretty good playmaker, but if you want the best of Kyrie, its gonna be his scoring not his passing skills. Also one of the reasons for Nets losing 4 in a row is because some of the bench players have been kind of under performing in Joe Harris and Landry Shamet. Harden needs to come back, he is our best playmaker and when Shamet and Harris plays with him, their scoring takes a huge boost."
Cuz we got Joe Harris and Landry Shamet for that
"Maybe not the ugliest, but Landry Shamet has got to at least be top 3 most punchable faces"
"He would have to be better than Mike James and Landry Shamet, which he almost certainly is defensively, even if he's an average defender at best."
No love for Landry Shamet ?
why are the nets letting LANDRY SHAMET initiate the offense when they have KD and kyrie on the floor??? yikes
Landry Shamet looks like he should be in Med School.
"The trade was actually better than just getting Saric though, as it was for the Payton pick.  The Payton pick was traded for the Saric pick, the Willy Hernangomez pick, and the Landry Shamet pick."
"They actually got the deal wrong, it was for the Elfrid Payton pick.   The Payton pick was traded for the Saric pick, the Willy Hernangomez pick, and the Landry Shamet pick."
"Anthony Edwards (44) passed Landry Shamet (43 in March, 2019) for most 3s made in a month by a rookie."
"He wanted Landry Shamet too, who after a rusty start to his Nets tenure, is looking like a very nice rotation piece with room to grow his game still."
"A lot of guys on the Nets honestly.   Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, Nicolas Claxton...  I can see any one of them stepping and making a big contribution."
Landry shamet gonna turn into Klay
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5.

"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
"Kyrie dropped 37 points on your ""elite defense"" while fasting LMAO. Kd and Harden will dominate and are also going to draw so much attention that shooters like Joe Harris and Landry Shamet are going to be wide open. Also Embiid scored 39 points on 30 shots, I'll live with that any day."
"The Sixers needed to put in their starters the last 5 minutes of the game to close out Landry Shamet, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown and Tlc. That's quite pathetic and embrassing. You aren't winning anything when your second best player can't hit a jumpshot and your second best offensive weapon is a marginal 20 ppg scorer. The 76ers realistically aren't a threat to the Nets, EVERY nets fan knows that and see the Bucks as a bigger adversery. The 76ers are the most fraudulent team in recent memory."
"Bruh the Nets have JAMES HARDEN and KD, 2 of the top 3 scorers in nba history on their team. They also have Kyrie Irving who might be the best 3rd option in nba history. When you have those 3 guys and shooters surrounding them their defense just has to be slightly average for them to win everything. Because at the end of the day Dennis Shroder, Kuzma and Drummond won't mean shit when Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, and Landry Shamet are getting wide open looks because teams are trying to double Harden and Durant."
"The Nets average 119 ppg with Kd missing over 2 months of basketball. The Heat aren't doing jack shit they gave up 30 points to Landry Shamet yesterday they're getting obliterated by Harden and Kd. There's a very good reason why the heat have an average record, they're an average team."
You're talking ab a man who was upset he wasn't the team alpha vs LeBron James the goat. You think he's going to let Landry Shamet shine more than him???
"Yes. At their peaks Westbrook and KD were arguably top 5 players, and they also had Adams and Ibaka who were quality players   Then he went to the Warriors which most people agree was the greatest team ever assembled. The Shaq Kobe lakers were great and both those guys were MVP candidates but there weren’t two other all NBA level players on their team, same with the Bulls. Only other team that could come close to the fire power might be the 1986 Celtics with Larry, McHale, parish and Dennis Johnson. Bill Simmons specifically wrote that the 1986 Celtics couldn’t happen again because of salary caps. Now he’s with Kyrie, Harden, DJ, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, etc.  The list of guys who he’s played with at or close to their peak are Steph, Klay, Russ, Harden, Kyrie, Draymond, Ibaka.  There are 3 other MVPs on that list, multiple all NBA players, and it wasn’t like bird playing with a broken down Bill Walton."
"Yes they do, Joe Harria and Landry shamet are two of the top 3 poimt shooters in the league. Blake Griffin and Green are valuable bench pieces who only get better when Harden and Durant are on the floor. The Heat ARE NOT THAT GOOD STOP BEING DELUSIONAL. Holy shit this is embarrassing."

LANDRY SHAMET HAS ARRIVED FOLKS
Giving up 22 points through 3 to Landry Shamet is a tough pill to swallow when fighting for a playoff spot.
Landy Steph Landry Shamet Curry Shamet
"big 3 of landry, michael, and shamet"
Landry “Steph Curry” Shamet
who needs KD when you have Landry Shamet. Dude has been killing it lately
"Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet isn't insane depth if luckily 2-3 of them even get  a chance to play in the playoffs for over 5 minutes"
Landry Shamet on the Nets. He got to a really rough start to begin the season but he's been amazing the past month+
"Spot on. He also loves to repeat anecdotes constantly. I don’t know how KOC doesn’t just cut him off and say, yep, we have heard your ‘guys who don’t suck’ rant on Landry Shamet about 7 times now."
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"I mean Kyrie just dropped 37 pts and 9 asts starting alongside Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, and Landry Shamet....Phil;y cant guard any of these guys"
He had 9 assists?  who the fuck you want him to be passing to when Landry Shamet is the only other guy on the court who can dribble the damn ball. Classic Philadelphia intelligence
landry shamet having a revenge game or some shit
Yeah you aren’t doing it for defense the foul problem stuff is definitely true though   Real question is whom do you put as your 5th guy if BKN with those 3 and Joe Harris. Pretend to still care about defense with like Bruce brown or just say fuck this and put in Landry Shamet and go all in on offense and spacing. Think at that point I would probably do the latter. Dont give Joel Embiid a natural matchup defensively
Landry Shamet looks like Ruby Riot from WWE
Bruce Brown + Landry Shamet
I’m taking Landry shamet or giannis’s brother
"he choked by guarding landry shamet the last 2 minuets of play instead of KD, but it's not like he's a 2x MVP &amp; DPOY or anything. if KD only scored 34 people would say he choked so idk what you're talking about."
"couldnt even hit that baby skyhook over landry shamet, of course kareem is shook"
Landry Shamet is now superstar
How are they not? Blake griffin right now better than rob williams?? Landry shamet over marcus smart?? lmaooo alright my guy
"One of those threes was a pull up against Landry shamet. Think about how dumb that is, to be giannis and not back down someone that small. Now take that stupidity and apply it to play after play after play for the offense, and now you have an idea of just how dumb the bucks played offensively. And not to mention their defense. Didn’t bother doubling KD till mid 4th quarter. Didn’t even attempt to put the DPOY on him for a possession here and there."
Of course his presence was important.  The Bucks had Jrue Holiday cover him down the stretch.  Lets say Mike James was out there.  Durant gets doubled.  The Bucks then dare Mike James (or Landry Shamet) to beat them.
Refs have allowed PJ Tucker to body check KD and eye gouge everyone in sight😂. If Landry Shamet tried defending Middleton like that he’d foul out in the first quarter. Guys with “stopper” reputations always get away with the handsy stuff and are officiated differently
"It’s honestly mind boggling to the point of being hilarious how fucking stupid the Bucks were last night. Seemed like any time they had a mismatch they’d either flush it down the toilet (Giannis fadeaway over broken Harden) or they’d run motion, and if there was no mismatch they’d settle into iso basketball with Jrue missing shots so badly the TNT screw thought it was blocked. Then in defense it’s just constantly taking your best defender and sitting him in the corner on Landry Shamet while Middleton just got cooked over and over and over again one on one against KD. No double. Just bbq chicken over and over and over."
What if LeBron James injures Landry Shamet and has to sit for the rest of the season? Would it be fair for Lakers (and viewers worldwide) to miss their best player while Nets are missing a roleplayer? Same thing even if Zaza didn't play. Warriors would have won the series regardless if Kawhi didn't play.
Then don’t play a wing position. I’m not respecting someone as a defensive player that wont guard their counterparts. I don’t agree with Gobert’s DPOYs but he is absolutely all NBA 1st team as a center. No centers give him work consistently and he always challenges. Giannis sits in the corner on Landry Shamet waiting for drives I’m not respecting it sorry
"I mean the whole game, yeah. I get the logic.  But not when KD is on a tear and is hot like he was in the 4th quarter. In the 4th quarter, Giannis should be guarding opposition best player.   The likes or Jordan, LeBron or Kobe etc didn't exactly guard opposition best player always throughout the game. But late in the game in crucial possessions in the 4th quarter, they guarded the opposition best player. Giannis should be tasked to do the same. Have PJ Tucker on KD for the first three quarters. Then have Giannis.  It was embarrassing to watch Giannis on Landry Shamet and Joe Harris when KD was cooking Tucker and Middleton. Not even a Bucks fan and watching that made me so mad."
"Hey, hey, hey! You watch your mouth! He also guarded Landry Shamet some possessions down the stretch 😤"
Landry Shamet sounds like a MILF pornstar tho so I understand.
Giannis didn’t want to get lit up by the best player in the world. That’s why he jerks off in the corner guarding Landry shamet
"I dont understand why Giannis doesn't just back down his defenders and have his way with them. He's way more gifted to be settling for 3s and jumpers. The guy can literally out muscle the whole Nets defensive front, yet he continues to refuse to do so.  Also as good as this night was for KD, WTF is the Nets bench doing. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet HAVE to add more than a combined 14pts."
"Shout out to Landry Shamet , he took all the bucks’ attention to himself so that Kd could score easily. /s"
Giannis really decided to stand in the corner and guard Landry Shamet and Joe Harris instead of KD
MY POINT EXACTLY. How many people have blocked a KD pullup jumper?? Giannis one of the few and he's put on...Landry fucking Shamet.
Landry Shamet looks like Trae Young with better hair
Cannot get over how Landry Shamet is the waluigi version of trae
I mean he does have a DPOY who has been sitting in the corner on Joe Harris and Landry Shamet all game
"What's weirder from this game:  a) Old Jeff Green going for a career playoff high in his second game back from injury  b) Last year's DPOY who is affectionately nicknamed ""freak"" standing in the corner guarding Joe Harris or Landry Shamet in the biggest game of the season whilst Kevin Durant lights his team up"
Nets players points total/shooting %  Jeff Green 24 points - 7/9 shooting   Blake Griffin 17 points - 7/11 shooting  Landry Shamet 7 points - 3/5 shooting   Joe Harris **5 points - 2/11 shooting**  **James Harden 3 points - 1/10 shooting**   Bruce Brown 2 points - **1/5 shooting**  KD almost has half of his teams points lmaoooooo
Budenholzer watching his job flash before his eyes as Landry fucking Shamet effectively attacks the basket lmao
The ball went in but Giannis has no business pulling up to shoot on Landry shamet
Y dont u worry about ur shitty team. U got a 7'3 landry shamet making 30$ mil and lukas whos gonna force a trade in a few years.
"He's like 70%. He looks good other than the fact isn't taking people off the dribble and driving. He's basically a post up shooter, but even 70% Harden is better than uhhh idk Landry Shamet? I think it just looks worst because he's 70% AND rusty, so he looks like he's 50% or worse."
Durant passes up a fast break to Landry Shamet
It's all on the line for Landry Shamet tonight.
"I don’t understand the logic right now. The nets are not in a win now situation.  They retain the following players for the next 2 seasons: - Kyrie Irving - Kevin Durant - James Harden - Joe Harris  They have the following under contract for next season: - Spencer Dinwiddie  - DeAndre Jordan - Landry Shamet - Nicholas Claxton - Alize Johnson  They potentially lose: - Blake Griffin (Starter minutes) - Bruce Brown (Bench/Starter minutes) - Jeff Green (bench/starter minutes) - Mike James (Bench Minutes) - Reggie Perry (Reserve) - Timothe LC (Reserve) - Tyler Johnson (Reserve)  Most of the expiring contracts are Minimum contracts or the MLE. The nets are in an ok spot going into next season, and they don’t need starter minutes they need decent or even meh bench minutes. They’ll be able to attract ring chasers. This is not a win or bust season. Keep James Harden healthy.  Even though I may be biased as a bucks fan it’s illogical to push someone injured to play, like a lot of nets fans are. Getting AD this season and KD from 2019 vibes."
"Joe Harris or Landry Shamet has to go off, and either Khris or Jrue needs to have an off night"
"I can  Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Jeff Green etc"
"KD has carried worst teams against better opponents?  He has always had an MVP next to him in all of his past playoff series except for 2 i think due to Russ having an injury, and they lost to Grizzlies one year and beat Houston one year that started players like Omer Asik, Chandler Parsons and Francisco Garcia with a 2013 James Harden.   If KD can win this series against Milwaukee without Kyrie and James harden this could arguably be his crowning achievement.  No ring is involved with winning this series, but carrying guys like Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Blake Griffin, Mike James etc is way more then he had to do in the past."
PG Kevin durant  SG joe Harris  SG Landry Shamet  SG TLC C Jeff green  Second rotation PG Tyler Johnson SG TLC SG Kevin durant  SF Blake griffin C deandre Jordan
"Shake Milton or Kevin Huerter, Landry Shamet &amp; Bruce Brown probably, Mikal Bridges"
"It's more he'd be getting too much credit if they won this series.   The biggest difference for Milwaukee's improvement (besides the Nets' injuries) isn't that Bud is coaching amazingly well, it's that Bud is no longer holding them back by making them overreact to any sort of offensive penetration.  He's been bullied out of his ""let's let them keep shooting until they get tired"" strategy that he's been trying to force for 8 years now.  A FO shouldn't have to pull a coach's teeth and publicly threaten his career multiple times just to make him stop triple-teaming Landry Shamet on drives.   A normal coach could give them the same defensive scheme they had in G4, without fucking around and losing games earlier on."
"G2 was out of hand largely because of coaching though.   G2 they were sending 3 bodies to stop a Landry Shamet drive as if he were Prime Shaq and were pretending like Mike James was James Harden. Because they were over-committing so hard it made things way too easy for the Net's big players.  G4 didn't get out of hand, even while Kyrie was healthy, because they played sensible basketball. With a healthy Kyrie, this would have been a super competitive game, which is a huge improvement over what the Bucks were bringing earlier on."
Scarier than Landry Shamet
Giannis was rattled for no reason as the Nets won by 40. KD still scored 30 with a backcourt of Mike James and Landry Shamet
"Because the Nets literally had no backcourt. Our top 2 guards after Kyrie and Harden are Mike James and Landry Shamet. Guess who a defensive-oriented team gets to focus on with that lineup…  Not trying to excuse KD, he did not have a good game at all. Just showing the very clear reasons why he was limited to under 30 points."
Some interesting duos of the tonight's game between the Nets and the Bucks.     |Duo|Score (for the Bucks)| |:-|:-| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton|82-51| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Pat Connaughton|53-26| |Khris Middleton + Pat Connaughton|56-31|  &amp;#x200B;  |Duo|Score (for the Nets)| |:-|:-| |Jeff Green + Landry Shamet|15-6| |Kyrie Irving + Jeff Green|8-0| |Jeff Green + Nicolas Claxton|27-21|
Having Mike James and Landry Shamet be your staring backcourt is a curse for sure.
Hey at least Landry Shamet is +1 amiright?
"And if Joe Harris is on the bench they can bring in baby Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, who is a career 40% 3 point shooter and has been shooting it at around 42% in the playoffs so far. That team is nuts"
Landry Shamet actually
Hey if your star player can’t shoot he’s completey worthless. Doesn’t matter what else he can do. In fact the Bucks should trade Giannis for Landry Shamet to improve their spacing. I am smart and know basketball.
Landry Shamet looks like Hades from the Hercules movie.
Landry Shamet could impale a man on his chin
"need a landry shamet special, its been a while since he's gotten hot from the 3"
"Yes analytics guys like Ben Taylor also watch film and understand schemes. Still doesn’t change the fact that they were completely wrong about KD and Kyrie. Do you realize that the Nets were blowing out the Bucks by 49 points at one point? A Bucks team that has Jrue Holiday, Giannis, Khris Middleton along with Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, and other solid role players. There is a swagger to the game of basketball that dudes like Ben Taylor don’t understand. Kyrie and KD only combined for 54 points but the way in which they scored was amazing and effortless. It made the Bucks hesitant to play their gritty, physical style and they fell into the trap of trying to match KD and Kyrie’s coolness/ swagger/ shotmaking ability which very few can do. Not only that. When you see your teammates making highlight reel type plays every trip down the court it gives the teammates supreme confidence. Bruce Brown’s floater game was on another level. Landry Shamet banged two back to back laser beam three pointers.   In short, basketball is about confidence and when you have two of the most skilled scorers ever on your team who don’t let the ball stick in their hands then that confidence becomes infectious. There are no analytics for this. Ben Taylor probably knows this but chooses not to bring it up because again there are no analytics for this."
Simmons is a 6’10” Landry Shamet with worse shooting
&gt; Also Blake Griffin scared him from driving to the paint  Its not just Blake. I'm pretty sure I saw Giannis pull back from his drive when Landry freaking Shamet stepped into his path.
"Landry ""team elevator"" Shamet"
So the sixers got decent value at least. People shitting on the Tobias trade didn't make sense to me. Trading that pick and Landry shamet wasn't much and Mike Scott was instrumental in the playoffs that year. It looks even better in hindsight as shamet hasn't really gotten better and that pick was ruined when we traded Butler to Miami and the NBA ruling that the draft wouldn't be a double dip like we thought. The contract is a separate issue but this team would not be what it is without Tobias.
Landry Shamet
&gt; he also got criticized for trading the pick that became Sadie Bey for Landry Shamet  The team is trying to win now. Shamet is a proven productive NBA player who has contributed to plenty of winning so far and who still has multiple years still left on his rookie contract. Thats much more than you can say about whoever they could have taken with the 19th pick that night. Sure you can with hindsight see how good Bey turned out but there is no guarantee that the Nets would have taken him (we picked him for them after the trade was agreed upon) and even if we did we aren't in position to let him develop on the floor like the rebuilding Pistons are. We need guys that will help us win now for cheap and getting someone like Shamet for that pick is a much better bet than Bey or anyone else they could have taken. Sure we might miss out on some of the upside (and extra years on the rookie contract) with Bey but if it gets us a championship either of the next 2 years it was more than worth it.
"There have been some high risk high reward plays Marks has made that haven’t panned out like giving offer sheets to Tyler Johnson, Allen Crabbe and Otto Porter Jr. he also got criticized for trading the pick that became Sadie Bey for Landry Shamet but I think he’s done a great job filling out this roster. I also think that if he had known what the June roster would look like he would’ve tried to add another big in addition to Lopez and Clax (not gonna mention DeAndre)"
I also saw Giannis take a fadeaway in the post with the defensive stopper Landry Shamet guarding him in that game.
"Honestly, if I'm the Bucks' GM I would have made a phone call at halftime.   [""leave a shooter open to trap a Landry Shamet drive 1 more time and you're not coaching G3"".](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=162&amp;GameID=0042000212&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Griffin%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20\(5%20PTS\)%20\(Shamet%202%20AST\)&amp;sct=plot)  Shamet's being guarded by the reigning DPOY and you've got your C camping the paint. You don't need a 3rd body there.  You're guarding Landry Shamet, not Shaquille O'Neal."
"Bucks deserve some hate but let’s give the Nets SOME credit. Shout out to:  Kyrie Irving for showing everybody that next step he’s taken to a bonafide star.  Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James for being those role players off the bench playing great minutes and filling in on the offense without losing a step.  The bench unit for stomping on the Bucks bench unit in garbage time.  Steve Nash for having these guys all play up to their potentials and play good basketball. And good defense."
"No Harden. Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James all putting in good minutes. Defense has taken a 180 since the beginning of the season. Kyrie has taken a step forward and is playing the best basketball of his career. But y’all will say anything except give anybody on the team, including Nash, any credit at all."
"Shout out to:  Kyrie Irving for showing everybody that next step he’s taken to a bonafide star.  Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet and Mike James for being those role players off the bench playing great minutes and filling in on the offense without losing a step.

"From what I understand, Coach Bud has been telling his players to “focus on the little things.” But how in the world is that the answer? The same issues that plagued the Bucks, especially on the defensive end, in Game 1 plagued them again in Game 2. How many times were the Bucks caught over-pursuing and double teaming Mike James or Landry Shamet then getting burned by Irving or Durant? Why are wing defenders playing so far off of slower 3 point specialists even when the drive threat is mitigated and you’re getting burned from behind the arc? Why is Giannis shooting 3’s regularly when you’re often running 4 substantially better shooters on the court at the same time? Did you get the scouting report from last game that a Middleton drive into the paint is exactly what the Nets are planning for and countering effectively?    I get I’m armchair quarterbacking an NBA team. I get the Nets have home court advantage, and that it may be early on in the series. I get that Bud played Giannis more tonight for once. However, it’s not going to matter how much Giannis plays or if the Nets cool off when big issues like this are not addressed."
Who is that in the picture at the top? No way that’s trae. It literally looks like Landry shamet
yes because Mike James looks like Landry Shamet
Marv is calling Mike James Landry Shamet. Got I can't wait for this senile fuck to retire.
"Bruh, Landry Shamet out here yamming on the Bucks"
Jesus. Landry Shamet just murdered somebody. LANDRY SHAMET
Landry shamet sheeesh
"With Harden out, would the Nets be better or worse if Nash played the Landry Shamet minutes himself?"
Landry Shamet looks like bargain bin Matt Barnes.
The graphic for the Game 2 promos should feature Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes versus Mike James and Landry Shamet.
Its very early and still a lot of panning out for these guys but honestly I think this is better overall than both because of how deep it is guys like landry shamet jalen brunson kevin huerter robert williams devontae graham late first rounders early second rounders having some pretty solid roles on good teams so mix in the top guys of the draft with all the other good role players and its super well rounded
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
and a Miami first rounder that was flipped with Landry Shamet and scraps for Tobias Harris.
&gt;humbled by Landry Shamet in a muppet wig.   This is amazing!
Foolius Vandal and Nerdlens Four-L are fake tough guys who just got humbled by Landry Shamet in a muppet wig.   Meh not by best but you gotta admit it is something new to say!
KD barely ahead of Landry Shamet and Harden with no beard
"KD, Harden, and Claxton are all lightyears better as defensive options on Simmons. Hell, even Landry Shamet was better on Simmons than Green was this year. Maybe you've attributed some defensive attributes to Green because he still has crazy hops, but he is legitimately a bad defender. His absence hurts Brooklyn on O, but the only effect it has on D is reducing depth. There's not a single person in the Nets organization or fanbase that has Jeff Green pencilled in as ""defensive stopper/paint deterrent"" against *anyone*, let alone Ben Simmons."
Landry Shamet 0/0/0 and -26... did this dude single handedly lose Brooklyn the game?
"I don’t think their roster is shallow at all. They have great roll players  Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Nick Claxton, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet  Hard to ask for more than that"
Hmm a Landry shamet
I just realized Landry Shamet kinda looks like Waluigi
Landry Shamet looks like trae young before he had 6 kids and started balding
Gus be like Landry Shamet is a better asset than Tyler Herro
"I agree that the Clips kind of sold their soul to get Kawhi and PG. They had such a promising mix of young talent and good veterans like Lou Will, Montrezl Harrell and JaMychal Green. I was so disappointed they traded away Tobias Harris, Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Landry Shamet. That 2018 team was awesome to see, it felt like those young OKC and Warriors teams before they found real postseason success.   They technically replaced them all pretty well on paper, but they lost a lot of chemistry in the process and I don't think Kawhi and PG have been a great fit in personality or leadership.  If things blow up this year which I'm kind of hoping they do, I'd be excited to see how they can refresh with Mann, Kennard, Zubac and others. They have pieces where they won't be a dumpster fire like the post-LeBron Cavs, but who knows what happens."
landry shamet ugly af
Game 3: Ainge’s trade exception blocks the shit out of Landry Shamet in garbage time
Landry Shamet said fuck this game I need to lie down
"All teams involved in that trade got a decent return. Detroit got Saddiq Bey and cash considerations, Nets got Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet, Clippers got Luke Kennard and 4 second round picks."
Not even close. Not even the ugliest on his team. Have you seen Landry Shamet? Looks like Waluigi going through puberty
Would you trade being an NBA player for looking like Landry Shamet?
"Nets: “Hey Landry I heard you were feeling under the weather, thats too bad-  Shamer: “Nah, I’m fine”  Nets: “Are you sure, I mean, it sure would suck yo play without you but”  Shamet: “I’m seriously fine I can play-  Nets: “We’ll inform the league you can’t play, feel better!”"
I count Landry Shamet as first round pick since he was recently drafted and playing well.  Miami’s 21 is a mid FRP not late. That’s a good amount of assets to overpay a good but not all-nba level player.
"Landry Shamet's career numbers through the end of last season:  2.1 3pm/ 5.2 3pa = ~40%  Landry Shamet this year:  2.1 3pm/ 5.4 3pa = ~38%  &gt; After I wrote that, I looked it up. His attempts per game and % are both close enough this season to career average that it's just a wash.  Oh yeah, there you go."
Nets receive: Damian Lillard  Blazers receive : Kyrie Irving and Landry Shamet/Bruce Brown  Dame can guarantee himself a championship IMO if this is done
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."
suddenly i’m gonna make my move on landry shamet
Nets without Harden and Kyrie vs Lakers without AD and LeBron wouldn't really do well. I mean I'd care more about the finals than I do now because my team is there but I won't be soaking every second of the Dennis Schroder vs Landry Shamet duel.
Shout out to Landry Shamet
He wasn't getting any playing time behind Landry Shamet and asked for a trade in the fall of 2018.  Instead they traded Shamet to the clippers and he's had playing time since then.  Although it's certainly possible he had more grievances than just not getting to play.
Landry Shamet was their best shooter at one point if I’m not mistaken
Landry Shamet. Next question.
"&gt;Dame is out. Enjoy watching Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown the next 2 seasons  I agree"
I wouldn't say criminal. Lavine's season averages almost are similar to Lillard when he was 25.   Lavine won't make an all-NBA but it ain't like he's fucking Landry shamet to say it's criminal lmao
landry shamet played better in every game of that series outside of game 1 when joe was raining 3's  he played 7 minutes in game 7!  jeff green would have been better too
"and doesnt play ice cold joe fucking harris 40 minutes in a damn elimination game  swear to god every 5 minutes I was saying why is joe harris on the floor, what the fuck did landry shamet do to deserve this.  Is he injured?"
"&gt; Joe Harris shot almost 50% from 3 in the regular season and all of a sudden it's KD's fault he chokes?  You're the one talking about Joe Harris- don't put words in my mouth just because they're easier for you to argue against.  It's not KD's *fault* that he's not as good as grooming role players for the playoffs as Lebron is, it's just a fact and why Lebron is widely considered the better player.    Joe Harris is just *one* role player of many- Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Mike James, DJ even Blake and Jeff Green at this point.  Why is it that none of them could reach the stratospheric heights of the All-NBA talents named, let me check my notes...Eddie House, Mario Chalmers, Dellavadova, and Varejao?  I hate this dumbass blame game fans like you play.  It's not KD's **fault** that he's not as good at certain aspects of leadership as Lebron, it's just a fact.  I don't hate the guy, I'm just not so far up his anus that I deny reality."
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
"Reassess what? Passing it to an open Joe Harris for him to brick another 3? I much rather have KD playing hero ball. Jeff Green, Kyrie, Harden were all hurt. Is KD supposed to rely on Joe Harris, Landry Shamet and a washed up blake griffin?"
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
"I did. Which really adds to the point I was trying to make.  David West had a really good career. Was a 2x All Star and a big part of some of the most successful teams in New Orleans Pelicans (then Hornets) history, then was a big part of a couple runs to the ECF with Indiana, and then as an old guy still was able to contribute off the bench to two titles with GSW.  No one can guarantee me that any one of JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet will have a better career than David West, yet he never comes up when discussing 2003, to the point that I literally forgot to mention him."
"I mean, if we're going to talk about ""nice depth pieces"", then god,   2003 has: Chris Kaman, Boris Diaw, Leandro Barbosa, Josh Howard, Kyle Korver, Zaza Pachulia, Mo Williams, Matt Bonner, Luke Walton, Kirk Hinrich,  84 had: Sam Perkins, Alvin Robertson, Otis Thorpe, Kevin Willis, Jerome Kersey, Vern Fleming.   1996 had: Camby, Marbury, Antoine Walker, Kerry Kittles, Peja, Jermaine O'Neal, Big Z, Derek Fisher, Shareef Abdur-Rahim.  I just listed off a ton of guys who made 1-2 All Star teams, guys who started on teams that made multiple deep playoff runs, guys who won titles, guys who were solid starters for over a decade.  Like, no disrespect to any of the players you just mentioned, but you can find Robert Williams, Gary Trent Jr. and Landry Shamet caliber players in literally ever draft.  Unless a draft class goes like, all 60 players deep with ""nice depth pieces"", then ""depth pieces"" really don't matter in an argument on which draft class is the best."
"2018 has SGA as well  they also have a lot of depth pieces in JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet"
"Have we though? Under Brett Brown, we developed RoCo, Dario, TJ McConnell, Landry Shamet, and Jerami Grant into solid role players and Grant is an above average starter. Furkan and Shake are coming along nicely as well. Considering the draft position of all those players that’s a pretty good development record.   Developing players is a two way street. Jah, Noel, and Wood all struggled here, but Jah was (and is) immature and set in his ways. Wood admitted he needed a wake up call to begin taking his development seriously. Fultz was an anomaly and needed a change of scenery. Otherwise, we’ve had a pretty good record of developing talent imo"
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
21 Nets with Bron lose in the first round and everybody in here would be trashing Joe Harris and Landry Shamet calling them some of the worst players in the NBA and wondering how the Nets FO could ever surround such a deity like LeBron with such fucking bums
"So Sean Marks shouldn't have been close?   Traded for James Harden, Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet. Extended Joe Harris. Signed Jeff Green. Added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge in the buyout market. Put together the most stacked coaching staff of all time in Steve Nash, Mike D'Antoni and Jacque Vaughn.  But your saying that Jones adding Chris Paul and Jae Crowder to the roster is such an incredible feat, that despite every roster move the Nets made, ""no one should've been close"" to what Jones did?"
"Played his heart out for them, he didn't have to play  your response gonna be some bullshit like ""he shouldn't have played then""  Okay, good to know you'd take Mike James &amp; Landry Shamet as your primary ball handlers."
"Excuse me, did you not see Giannis clamp a stationary Landry Shamet in G5?"
"Ryan Andersen, Eric gordon, joe Harris, landry shamet. There's a reason its called the big balls dance and those 4 never done it."
Landry Shamet and a coors light for Dame
Yeah just sub in Landry shamet instead
"Harris was laying bricks all night, Blake was very solid but let’s be real he isn’t a real offensive threat other than off ball, and harden wasn’t himself obviously. Who next? Landry Shamet?"
Landry Shamet was better the last 5 games
"Landry Shamet would've done better, tbh"
Landry Shamet still has one more year left.
Landry shamet was in the game and wanted no part of shooting
"Nets bench with ZERO shots.  2 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 fouls.  Jeff Green with 13 minutes.  Landry Shamet with 7 minutes.  Nicolas Claxton with 1 second."
i got to watch THE landry shamet
What happened to Landry Shamet? I thought he was pretty good and surprised he's not involved in the offense at all
"landry shamet must have had the worst shootaround in the history of shootarounds to justify joe harris being on the floor right now  steve nash just clenching his teeth.. any minute guys, joe harris is gonna break off a huge run just you wait"
Is joe harris really better than landry shamet though?
Surely Landry Shamet can’t be as bad as Harris
"No Ayton can't. Just look at the Harden only Nets game, the Portland game and there were some other games as well. Landry Shamet of all people was getting blowbys"
Simmons? Thybulle? Maxey? Saric? Vucevic? RoCo? Jerami Grant? Landry Shamet? Shake Milton?
"Trade Gobert for DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris and Landry Shamet."
"Clippers will have beaten most of the starting lineup from Lob City if we win it all. JJ, CP3, DJ, and Blake; Boban &amp; Landry Shamet too"
And now we face Chris Paul then very hypothetically at this point Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan (and Landry Shamet).  What a narrative that would be
"Which is crazy considering he’s 33 years old in his first year back from a torn Achilles and playing 44 minutes per game in the series while his team runs a 6 man rotation consisting of himself, 1 legged Harden, 34 year old Jeff Green, the ghost of Blake Griffin, Joe Harris with the 3 point accuracy of Shaq, and Landry Shamet. The Nets are a superteam on paper and when healthy, but in reality this is KD doing something nobody expected him to even be physically capable of trying to carry a roster which is literally half crippled into the conference finals."
"I agree he shouldn't be guarding through screens, but if he cant fight through screens and gets stuck on Landry Shamet in the playoffs maybe he shouldn't be 1st team all defense?"
"Otto Porter Jr, Landry Shamet, Royce O’Neal, Cam Payne, Dwight Howard is your best case scenario for a starting lineup"
Why is Landry Shamet the Giannis stopper?
Is coach Landry Shamet gonna keep KD and Harden in?
Joe Harris and Landry Shamet don’t deserve to get paid tonight
If Matt Barnes and Trae Young had a kid he would look like Landry Shamet
Why does Joe Harris and Landry Shamet even have ball privilege anymore?
"yeah they do, landry shamet"
You'd think Giannis was putting up 10ppg and getting torched by landry shamet with the way y'all talk about him on both ends this series in this thread
Landry Shamet has the same nose and jaw as Emporer Charles V
landry shamet should seriously be starting over joe harris
Tell me why this entire time I thought Landry Shamet was a Euro prospect with a thick-ass Eastern European accent and instead he ends up being an American kid born in Missouri
Why is Nash starting Joe Harris over Landry Shamet?  Seems stupid isn’t it?
I assume most things don’t make sense to Landry Shamet.
"Savvy vet, Landry Shamet"
"Newly-healthy forward Jeff Green yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Joe Harris gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Landry Shamet yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Kyrie hit the locker room door, former NBA great Tim Duncan hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
You really think those are good cores for a championship team?  And Landry? Landry Shamet? Are you for real?
"Getting rid of those guys all happened under Elton Brand, not Colangelo.   * Brand took over on September 18th, 2018  * Brand traded RoCo &amp; Saric for Jimmy Butler on November 12th, 2018  * Brand traded Wilson Chandler &amp; Landry Shamet for Tobias Harris on February 6, 2019  * JJ Redick signed with New Orleans on July 15th, 2019"
"PG: Lebron James-$39  SG: Jamal Murray- $7  SF: Kevin Durant- $42  PF: Marcus Morris- $12  C: Nerlens Noel -$8  Bench:  Landry Shamet- $3  Bobby Portis - $3  Alex Caruso- $6  Not as beefy frontcourt wise as some of the other teams I see here and Bron's age/durability is worrying, but besides that, this is unstoppable."
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
This is why you dont use your first round pick on Landry Shamet.
We really traded Saddiq Bey for a year of Landry Shamet
The one that stumped me was Landry Shamet. I really thought he was white.
Landry freaking Shamet spoke at length about how much Kyrie worked with him and helped him with his game. Stop talking out your ass about stuff you clearly have no clue about
Also Landry Shamet. The Nets have way too many guards. They need to upgrade their roster with the forward position.
"Knicks fan here. I still consider our rival to be the Heat but I'm also an old person who still thinks it's 1999.   Jealous of the Heat for their consistent success. As a Ravens fan, I hate to say it but I consider them to be the closest analogue to the Ravens in the NBA. A relatively young franchise that has found a way to be consistently competitive and built a culture that both fanbases annoyingly hype up  I guess if in 2021, our rival is considered the Nets then I'm jealous of them for... I dunno... Jeff Green is pretty cool I guess? Landry Shamet looks like Waluigi so that's interesting and whatnot"
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
The league has spoken. It’s Landry Shamet
"**The Suns.**  **They will be back with last years team but:**  CP3 on a pay cut from 45mil to 30mil. Only 2 years of his 4 year deal are guaranteed.  Cam Payne is back on 6 mil a year for 3 years.  JaVale McGee is in to fill the hole at backup Centre.  Shamet is the new backup SG.  They are noticeably improved from last season and still have plenty of money to spend.  **The Suns have to following line-up AND 15 mil to spend (plus a 4.5mil injury exception):**  Chris Paul, Cameron Payne, Ty-Shon Alexander      Devin Booker, Landry Shamet      Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson      Jae Crowder, Jalen Smith,      Deandre Ayton, JaVale McGee"
"i mean we already have decent role players. mikal is an elite role player, crowder, cam johnson, cam payne good backup pg, landry shamet traded this year, just signed javale mcgee."
"Suns have now accomplished all of the following so far:  - Landry Shamet trade - Chris Paul 4-year, $120 million extension - Cam Payne 3-year, $19 million deal - JaVale McGee 1-year, $5 million  A perfect offseason unfolding fight now for Phoenix. And they are still $14.5 million away from the luxury tax threshold following the JaVale McGee signing."
"Suns’ 2021-22 rotation:  Starters = Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton  Second Unit = Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, JaVale McGee  Phoenix made the NBA Finals and upgraded their roster."
"If they sign half the FAs they’re rumored to it’s gonna be better than Mike James, Landry Shamet and Nic Claxton"
Landry shamet was great as a rookie and then regressed
Landry Shamet
It's Landry Shamet all over again
"I’m going back to the whole process. Philly’s fruits of the process were:  embiid, Okafor, Nerlens noelle, Ben simmons? Of course half those guys aren’t on the team. What did you think was going to happen?  I hope y’all bring Landry shamet back. I think that’d be a great value pickup and a good story"
They took a flyer because Lacob’s kid was doing their scouting. It says a lot about their scouting and Lacob’s influence. Wasting 3 2nd round picks is a big deal when they’re over the cap and don’t have a lot of assets. Those 2nd round picks could’ve been Bruce Brown or Landry Shamet or Evan Fournier.
Landry Shamet replacement. More shooters the better
"&gt; The Nets' fit isn't supposed to work either.  The Nets fit works because all three of their superstars are useful off-ball players, and they have Joe Harris who is a perfect role player on a team like that. Jeff Green and Landry Shamet combined to hit 40% of almost 600 threes this season.  The Lakers have virtually no shooting, and none of their big 3 are great shooters."
Landry Shamet
Is it better than Landry Shamet?  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * Ben Simmons * Joel Embiid * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * James Harden * Devin Booker * Deandre Ayton * Most likely CP3
You know what the Lakers need? They need one Landry Shamet. You know a really good three point shooter on a rookie contract. Hard to get those since they tend to cost 15+ nowadays. The Lakers are gonna cobble something together that works but it will be far from ideal since all the good shooters/defenders are worth way more then &lt;5 mil.
Landry Shamet (just under 40% at over 5 attempts per game) just went to Phoenix.  We can't put some sort of deal for that level of a player?
Im surprised they couldnt get a better player out of this for a late first. Landry Shamet was in and out of BKN's rotation last yr he really isnt particularly good and he's not super young(24 you know what he is basically). Not a lock he'll even be in the rotation for next postseason and he only has 1 yr left on his rookie deal.
"Bey was part of the Landry Shamet part of the trade.   The Musa for Brown trade was announced  a week before the draft then on the day of the draft they combined the 2 trades and made it a 3 team trade between Nets, Pistons, and Clippers."
"Why do people lose their god damn mind with the reality of the NBA? I just do not get it.   Cade has the potential (doesn't matter who it is - LeBron or Duncan could have been paralyzed in their first season and all anyone could have talked about was potential, even though those were two of the most surefire bets ever) to be the kind of player to be a franchise player. Not a ""Zach Randolph on the Grizzlies"" type of franchise player. A guy with a legit shot to be a #1 on a title winner.  You don't trade that for a guy you are don't know if he can be a winner and who you are, inherently, guaranteeing tens and tens of millions of dollars to.  Now, are some of these rumors about the Thunder listening to SGA offers that feature getting Landry Shamet in return full of shit? I can believe that."
"""Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Ingles, Josh Richardson, Landry Shamet, Aaron Holiday, and a variety of picks are being dangled in trades talks.""  With all due respects to those players, no player goes from untouchable to ""Landry Shamet's available; let's test it out!""   Keep in mind the organization we're talking about. They pissed away a dynasty with KD/Westbrook/Harden because they *might* (and turns out wouldn't have) gone into the luxury tax by resigning him. Shai's getting $100+ million after this coming season. OKC is far from being good and have confused themselves with an NFL team where a bunch of mid-to-late-first-round draft picks actually are worth more than a star player."
Landry Shamet is ass.
"Oh fuck no they cant have demar, landry shamet, AND bruce brown"
I see so from ur standpoint if landry shamet gets injured i can just swap him for steph curry?
"Joe Harris, the best 3 point shooter in the nba by %.  Blake Griffin &amp; Deandre Jordan, former all-nba players.  Jeff Green &amp; Landry Shamet, starters for other contenders. Bench players for the Nets."
1st team  Cam Payne  Desmond Bane  Cam Johnson  Patrick Williams  Draymond Green  2nd team  Tyrese Maxey  Landry Shamet  Dorian Finney smith  Nic Batum  Nerlens Noel  3rd Team  Ricky Rubio  Danny Green  Robert Covington  Bruce Brown  Robert Williams
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.

That’s Landry Shamet
"&gt;Bucks shot great in the regular season too  They were never the #1 3pt shooting team in NBA history &amp; you're totally missing the point.  The Nets didnt make the Bucks shoot bad, the Bucks shot bad because they were BAD.   Utah-DAL shot lights out because they're incredible offensive teams, Doncic-Mitchell are elite 3pt shooters, Giannis isn't, even THJ was a better 3pt shooter than Middleton.  Unlike KD Kawhi had a direct involvement in lowering their %s.   &gt;because their defense was another level.  They were doubling a shot Blake Griffin lol, that's POOR defense, terrible coaching.  I know how good dudes like Landry Shamet are I watched him all year in LA, same with how good KD is defensively, he's not that good.  I'm familiar with all these players.    Dallas shoots 50% from 3 with insane defense played on them, Milwaukee shoots 30% with shit perimeter &amp; paint defense.  That means FAR less shots back to Kawhi-LA and FAR more shots for KD-BKN.  Offense is much more difficult trying to combat a team hitting 50% of their 3s, you have to 1up them on every possession.   &gt;a better defense (and team   There's nothing to suggest that.  How are the 1st seed Jazz worse than the 3rd seed Bucks?  Even the 1st seed 76ers were headed by Doc, the biggest choking head coach in history.  The writing is on the wall my guy, it's very easy to see."
"Patty Mills, Paul Millsap, Lamarcus Aldridge, James Johnson, Javon carter, D’andre bembry, Sekou Doumbouya, Cam Thomas, Day’ron sharpe, Kessler edwards is a massive upgrade on Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Alize Johnson, Luwawu-caberet, Reggie Perry"
"Starting: Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Deandre Ayton Next 5: Cam Payne, Landry Shamet, Cam Johnson, Jalen Smith, Javale McGee"
Landry Shamet
"&gt; Traded Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Šarić and a 2022 2nd round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.  &gt; Traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, a 2020 1st round draft pick (Saddiq Bey was later selected), a 2021 1st round draft pick (Tre Mann was later selected), a 2021 2nd round draft pick (Jeremiah Robinson-Earl was later selected) and a 2023 2nd round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanović and Mike Scott. (Pick is MIA's 2021 1st-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2021 2nd-round pick.) (Pick is DET's 2023 2nd-round pick.)  They really didn’t trade that much for Butler. They traded a lot to the Clippers for Harris who was on a contract year and was a borderline all-star.  I agree that the 76ers set up Ben for failure though. Simmons was the 4th-5th option on the 2019 76ers that went 7 against Toronto. If they could have kept Butler and flipped Simmons then for pieces to build around Butler-Embiid than the 76ers would have been a perennial title threat."
This is one of the weakest of the weak.    I mean you don't need to be a basketball genius to know the corpse of Blake Griffin &amp; Landry Shamet (literally watched him play all last year) aren't good defenders.   Or see how the Clippers without Kawhi-Ibaka were 1 Ayton tip away from going up 3-1 to the Suns.
"Did you watch Milwaukee-BKN?  Milwaukee was barely and I mean barely able to run any offense against Brooklyn's backups, they had Blake Griffin on Giannis ffs, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, 1 legged Harden, KD who has never been anywhere near an elite defender, dude Nick Claxton who has played 47 NBA games was their #1 defender.    Bledsoe wasn't the problem &amp; they likely still win the Finals w him, this was a down year for the NBA with injuries."
Tyrese Maxey will have a Jimmy Butler type career. Late first round pick who basically wills himself into becoming an all star.  Landry Shamet will hit a Ray Allen/Robert Horry type shot to win a championship.
Cause there’s only one 🐐 and his name sort of rhymes with Landry Shamet
"Idk what they are saying about only having 3 people for the suns lol we have  Cam johnson - 25 (Idk if 25 counts or not)  Mikal Bridges - 24  Devin Booker - 24  Landry Shamet - 24  Tyshon Alexander - 23 (2-way player, maybe actually on the roster this year)  Deandre Ayton - 23  Jalen Smith - 21  That’s 7 players, half our team 25 and under"
he needed to get more criticism for playing joe harris over landry shamet against the bucks in the playoffs
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
"While this has been true, Sarver maxed Booker, extended CP3, extended Mikal Bridges, and extended Landry Shamet so it's not like he's pinching pennies.    Ownership and management really just don't want to go with a 5 year max on DA and I don't blame them."
"Yep same. If it's Bill Russell or Landry Shamet, I want to be Bill no doubt about it. But if I'm a guy like Hal Greer or Bill Sharman....I want the money."
We traded that pick for Landry Shamet and then traded Shamet a year later for Jevon Carter. And we are extremely thin at the wing position
"I know that Landry Shamet (as a draft pick) was part of the big trade that sent Andrew Bynum to Philly, Dwight Howard to the Lakers, and Andre Iguodala to the Nuggets"
The Lakers are the question mark story here. Everyone knows barring injury that the Suns are a good team right now. They barely changed from their finals run besides Landry Shamet and Javale. Of course they're gonna talk about the team that added a HoF player and only 3 guys on the roster stayed from the previous year
"Nobody on the Bucks was either you're just saying shit to say shit lol.  Dude was going the hell off, and Giannis barely guarded him at all, it was a major talking point throughout the series. Besides, you think Bruce brown and Landry Shamet are gonna lock up Trae Young? Lol."
He paid Landry Shamet $43 mil how cheap is he ? Ayton being a max player is debatable
they gave landry shamet 43 mil
Yup. Time to trade him for a real shooter like Landry Shamet.
Where that Goomby guy that was talking all that talk that Grayson Allen is way better than Landry Shamet.
A steal so good it gives us cap space to extend *Landry Shamet* and not DeAndre Ayton!!!
But they gave 43 mil to Landry Shamet lol  We'd gladly take Ayton in Toronto
"He's a 23-year-old big that just went to the NBA finals &amp; is a double-double machine. Phoenix gave Landry Shamet a four-year, $43 million rookie contract extension but they can't pay Ayton? It doesn't make a lot of sense to me."
"Yeah, I would argue Forbes is more consistent shooter though. The idea of Landry Shamet always was better than he's real production."
Landry Shamet..? Rookie..?
"&gt; That'd be an important deal for the Lakers  The Lakers got Monk and Elllington, who combined will make less than half of Shamet's salary.   Those 2 plus Melo and Bazemore still total less than Shamet's salary.   Pelinka would probably fire himself before Lebron could, if he woke up tomorrow and those 4 Lakers were replaced by Landry Shamet for more money."
1. DeAndre Ayton - None. 2. Marvin Bagley - None. 3. **Luka Doncic - 5/$207m**  4. **Jaren Jackson Jr - 4/$105m** 5. **Trae Young - 5/$207m** 6. Mo Bamba - None. 7. **Wendell Carter Jr - 4/450m** 8.

"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
You say that but it seems like more filler contract in a bigger deal because nobody see Landry Shamet at that amount as a positive asset.
"It just seems so insane.  Landry Shamet, a decent low-end of the rotation player who has been on four teams in four seasons, has an average annual contract value that is only slightly lower than Connor McDavid's, the best hockey player in the world."
He's gone.  And now you'll start Landry Shamet at center.  Am I getting warmer.
"Mikal Bridges and Landry Shamet, if Chris Paul is still there, CP can make any decent center look good, Some of you guys thought DJ was the best center in the league for a while because of CP3."
Landry Shamet got 11M a year &amp; Grayson is much better so this is pretty good to me.
Landry Shamet was real solid on the knicks
"Yeah it’s a little weird to this concern phrased as if it were absurd. He had lower body injuries for basically three straight years and had articles saying that his diet included like three giant [milkshakes a day](https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/06/sixers-landry-shamet-buys-joel-embiid-four-milkshakes-every-road-trip/) (which he later claimed he didn’t consume, FWIW).   He’s turning the “injury-prone” label around lately but it’s not like there wasn’t a reason for it."
"This play is the most Thanasis thing ever. He works hard, plays solid defense, and then just wildly runs around the court chasing the ball like a youth soccer player. And somehow doing that, while leaving a very good shooter in Landry Shamet wide open, works.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaXTyEW2x-E"
"This isn't an impressive list.   You can't count Bridges. They didn't pick him. They picked him for Phoenix because they wanted Zaire Smith.   Landry Shamet is a fringe rotation player and the very next pick was Robert Williams. Jalen Brunson, Devonte Graham and Mitchell Robinson all went within the next 10 picks.   Thybulle is fine for pick 20 but he's not a starter or anything.    Maxey has potential but hasn't really done anything yet. The same can be said for Joe."
"Some current players: Brad Wanamaker, Landry Shamet, Anfernee Simons.  Some past players: Sam Cassell, Lou Amundson, Chris Kaman"
"Agreed.  Ben (and Joel to a lesser extent) make three-point specialists look good and cover for them on D.   **JJ Redick** set the record for the oldest player to set a career high in ppg, then broke his own record the next year.    **Landry Shamet** was first team all-rookie with the sixers and hasn't matched any of his advanced stats from that season since (PER, TS, BPM, WS, VORP).    **Dario Saric** was a quality starter in his early twenties, second on a 50 win team in scoring and he has been a bench player after he left.  **Covington** is another guy who set all his career highs in philly.  **Furkan Korkmaz** was a free agent anybody could have had for the minimum but he's only a rotation player in Philly because Simmons covers for him on defense and sets him up on offense.  **Seth Curry** was a MLE signing who played on 5 teams in his first three seasons and has found a real home in Philly alongside Jo and Ben.  All these guys take at least half of their shots from three.  Ben is a tough fit and he shat the bed in the playoffs after he fell apart at the line but it's easy to forget he's a three-time all-star who made an all-nba team for a reason."
Now im just picturing landry shamet spending his 2020 running to sunset park to buy backwoods and swishers for the starters
they gave up two mid first rounders and Landry Shamet.  the trade wasn't really that bad.
you watch that game? because the suns only took out mikal when curry sat. and the primary defenders on poole were Book and landry shamet
I did not know Landry Shamet ended up on the Suns
Landry Shamet owns Stephanie
"Landry ""Luigi"" Shamet"
"the fact that the Suns have to play Elf, Landry Shamet, and CamPayne at once here is so hard to watch"
Landry shamet is ugly af
"Trading our Saddiq Bey pick for Landry Shamet. Oh my God, I love Marks, but he completely screwed up there. I know he beats himself up to this day about it."
"Brooklyn [traded Shamet for Jevon Carter and draft rights to Day'Ron Sharpe](https://www.nba.com/suns/suns-acquire-landry-shamet-brooklyn)  They're saying with Harris out and no Kyrie, they wish they kept Shamet who is a shooter"
Second Unit:  PG - Cam Payne  SG - Landry Shamet  SF - Cam Johnson  PF - Dario Saric (When healthy)  C - Javale McGee  Absolutely insane depth.

because he looks like great value landry shamet
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"It amounted to us trading both our picks in that draft for Tobias Harris.  At the time we made the Harris trade, Landry Shamet was looking like he'd turn out better than Mikal Bridges, and we were still holding out hope on Zhaire.  Things change. Most players improve. Some don't. It's really hard to predict who's going to make a jump.  I will say, at the time of the draft, Mikal was billed as a ""high floor, low ceiling"" guy, mostly because he had played 3 years already, and I for sure called bullshit on that. A good player is a good player, it's tough to say who's going to improve, but it's impossible to say ""oh yeah, this guy's good, but he won't improve"""

 That Landry shamet one is nuts with a *steep* falloff
Yep. I wanted Bane or Bey. We traded our pick for Landry Shamet only to trade him away the next season. Very salty about it.
"Just think, the Suns have been waiting 41 years worth of trades to get their guy *checks notes* Landry Shamet."
"Exactly, this team is too deep and we'll rounded to not have bounced back quickly. Backup center and shooting guard were our biggest weaknesses, and getting Javale McGee and Landry Shamet improved the team. And OP was acting like a few losses meant the Suns were doomed haha"
All 20+  Furkan Korkmaz  Landry Shamet  Matisse Thybulle  Tyrese Maxey  Top 3  Jahlil Okafor  Markelle Fultz  😫
"&gt;Jaylen Brown can shoot and is willing to shoot, that alone makes him more valuable in the playoffs than Ben Simmons.   This is a little extreme, no? Or are you saying you'd rather have guys like Campazzo, Pat Connaughton, or Landry Shamet than Simmons?  &gt;I'm not sure how anyone who's watched Ben Simmons play in his past 3 playoff series can even say he's better than Brown.  This I'd agree with, there's really no argument at this point"
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
"Elfrid Payton isn't good at basketball and keeps playing  Devin Booker is just bad so far  Suns in general suck. So called shooters can't shoot, bench scorer Landry Shamet is struggling to average 5 points a game"

How dare you slander Landry shamet like this
