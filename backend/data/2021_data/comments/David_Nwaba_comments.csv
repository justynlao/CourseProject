The Rocket's best player by RAPTOR metrics David Nwaba
DAVID FUCKING NWABA BABY!!
David Nwaba (???)
"They should unless injuries somehow get worse than they already have been.  They've emerged looking good from the toughest part of their schedule with about a third to half of their team out on basically every given night.  OP didn't even list Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Jae'Sean Tate, David Nwaba and Sterling Brown who have all proven to be very solid depth pieces... Plus, BOOGIEEE!"
David Nwaba
You forgot about CalPoly God David Nwaba?
oooh david nwaba narrowly avoids going to fenerbache
David Nwaba
Well they're starting David Nwaba so I'm going to say no
"Laker legend, david nwaba. real ones know. lol"
David Nwaba
"Chill bro - We've had our starting lineup for one game. There are a lot of things for this team to figure out, but they can still be good.  Silas has done a great job creating quality shots, they've just been created for bad shooters like David Nwaba. I don't think the shooting woes that have plagued us (Ranked 27th from three this year and shooting 28% for our last three losses) are exclusively Silas' fault. Getting Mclemore and House back should change that? Who knows, but PJ's doing great shooting almost 50% from three to start the year."
"anyone else just stoked David Nwaba is out there hoopin and hustlin again? he's never gonna be an all star but hes a perfect role player, guy gives it his all and plays tough defense, 15 points tonight"
DAVID NWABA CAUGHT A BODY
Harden   Wall  Wood  Gordon  House   Tate  Tucker  Are safe. So I suppose David Nwaba or Sterling Brown
"true. and i totally agree with you about Nwaba and Tate. it’s weird cuz every time i think David is gonna miss the layup he finishes, and then he misses the ones that are absolute bunnies. and i can’t even explain Tate — he’s just... he has something. Christian Wood needs to get with Hakeem and practice some footwork lol."
David Nwaba is poking the bear  Word to the wise: DON'T poke the bear
Shoutouts to ex-Bull David Nwaba. Guy was playing his heart out.

"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day.

"has there ever been a player like david nwaba? five years in the NBA, a different team every single season?"
I played at the court when David Nwaba was at cal poly  He played every now and then but i just remember him dominating a game in slides one time when we needed a 10th player and he was about to leave
you havent watched the nba for all-time if you think an all-star big -&gt; mvp caliber big is one of the biggest differentials of all-time haha  we see bigger literally every season. harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. way bigger difference
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol
David Nwaba he was supposed to have wrist surgery but he is in the process of getting a second opinion and is continuing to play

David Nwaba
"My little brother toured Cal Poly and I went with him and they talked about David Nwaba, who was in his second year at the time. Been a fan since"
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
Joe Harris &amp; David Nwaba
"Moses Brown, Jarred Vanderbilt, and David Nwaba."
"Not that John Wall is the same stratosphere of player but physically he's come back from devastating injuries and he's quite nimble, like you wouldn't know he had an achilles tear. In regards to physical health, he was impressive this year. It was crazy to see Cousins make a comeback but you could tell how much the injury took from him. David Nwaba too, he is still crazy athletic."
"“Consistent shooters? Look no further. We’re signing Stanley Johnson, James Ennis, and David Nwaba.” — Rob Pelinka, probably."
I think you’re right about the luxury tax calculations but I don’t feel like double checking lol.  They still have they’re taxpayer MLE which is valuable when vets want to come play. They also can use Oubre as a human trade exception to either trade for or get someone in a sign and trade. I also don’t think it would just be Wiseman for Wood. If they’re trading Wiseman they could probably get some decent role players such as Danuel House or David Nwaba since they’re not particularly valuable to Houston at this point. I think they could definitely build a top 3 team working with what they currently have.
"He’s basically gonna be a David nwaba, I’m a baylor fan I know ish’s game pretty well"
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
Anyone got any other players they'd like to compare to Simmons? It's day 2 and we've still yet to hear from the David Nwaba fans.
"I was baffled at that one while it happened, Bridges seemed like a polished 3&amp;D guy already, and Zhaire Smith seemed like a project David Nwaba with a Norman Powell ceiling. I didn't understand it."
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
Remember when David Nwaba was good
"He will not get the max on the open market, we will likely overpay him a couple million per year but that's the price you have to pay to get free agents in Cleveland. We've literally signed a TOTAL OF TWO bottom of the barrel UFAs in the past two offseasons, Damyean Dotson and David Nwaba lmao"
David Nwaba over Duncan Robinson?
"""The Rockets will spend $36M total on contracts of Kevin Porter Jr, Jalen Green, Christian Wood, JaeSean Tate, Kevin Martin Jr, Daniel Theis and David Nwaba. The Lakers are gonna pay Russell Westbrook $44.2M per yr."""
I agree but I do think we’re seeing more guys come back better from the Achilles. Durant is the most well known but Rudy gay was the first guy who I thought of when Durant was recovering as encouraging of someone that came back pretty well. Now David nwaba also came back well and players from other sports have been.   I wouldn’t be surprised if Klay is never the same but at the same time I don’t think it should be shocking if he does come back well
"Yeah cause he's useless off ball lol.  He attempted less catch and shoot FGs than David Nwaba last year and shot 32% on them.  From the floor, not 3.  And he took like 20 shots off cuts all season"

"He’s built, like David Nwaba"
BAE'SEAN GREAT  To a slightly lesser extent we all love David Nwaba
College to showcase talent or maybe a walk-in tryout as David Nwaba did.
"David Nwaba, Isaiah Hartenstein and Miye Oni"
"Dont worry, replaced him with *checks notes* Cedi Osman and David Nwaba"
Prime David Nwaba &gt;
"This happened with David Nwaba a few years ago with the Lakers.  We signed him from the G-League, waived him to make a little cap space with the intent of signing him again, but then he was picked up by the Bulls."
"Yea he's 6'7 that can get you double double if you give him minutes. He's not a shooter at all, he's a hustler like David Nwaba if you're familiar with him."
"Yup. Definitely. The Lakers love guys like THT throughout the years.   ""Young with potential"" who were late picks.  We've had a few who didn't turn out well like Darius Morris, Devin Ebanks, Andrew Goudlock, Anthony Brown etc.   But we've had some success too with Jordan Clarkson, Thomas Bryant, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, David Nwaba.   THT has been good enough. It's just that Lakers fans are just more vocal and lakers players get more spotlight.   JC and AC were better prospects IMO but they don't have THT's physical gifts which the Lakers are banking on."
David Nwaba
"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
David Nwaba
David Nwaba 🤢
"?!?!?!?! They have a roster full of rookies and 1-2 year players. What do you expect? They didn't go get anyone good in FA. The biggest notable signing I remember for the Rockets was them signing David Nwaba. I like Nwaba, but c'mon. The Rockets put together a roster that should win at most 5 games the entire season. 6 if they start to play John Wall."
"Play John Wall instead of Eric Gordon in the starting lineup, move Gordon to bench, give DJ Augustine's minutes to Gordon, cut House and give those minutes to Gordon too. Also too many low ceilings guys getting minutes. Brooks, Garrison Mathews, David Nwaba."
"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
"Dumb move, should have held on to Caruso. I think Pelinka has done a good job overall, but the list of players we've given up for nothing could make a pretty good squad...Randle, Brook Lopez, D'Lo, Caruso, Thomas Bryant, Gary Payton II, Dennis Schroeder, and David Nwaba. You gotta get SOMETHING for those assets. Not to mention the Westbrook trade, which has a chance to be Pelinka's Mozgov/Deng signing...the one move that unwinds years of otherwise solid work. I do like THT though, 3/$30M was a good deal."
David Nwaba is so much fun to watch. He gives 100% every single possession.
"Lakers had three high energy g league wings that have made it to the NBA now. Caruso, Payton, and David Nwaba"
"I don't understand why it's a terrible look for a professional athlete to say ""I'm paid to play basketball. I want to play and I want to help this team win in however many minutes they want to give me.""  Rockets clearly are not making the decision based only on who deserves minutes, or even who is young enough to contribute in the future. Eric Gordon is older than Wall, and he's getting plenty of minutes. David Nwaba isn't better than Wall, and he's not in the long-term plans, either."
