Trade you for Dame....         ....‚Äòs cousin Keljin Blevins

Keljin Blevins. Lillard's cousin
Keljin Blevins sounds like fake latvian name
Keljin Blevins' music is Yakety Sax
I hope we get to see Keljin Blevins tonight
Keljin Blevins beat OP's team in high school.
"He's been in training camp year after year so he knows the system. He's a solid practice squad guy that fits the culture, does what he needs to do to help the team, and otherwise stays out of the way. Given everything else with Covid this year, finding someone that meets all of the above criteria is not exactly easy, and a last roster spot is more likely to hurt you from a covid exposure standpoint than it is to win you a ballgame. I for one appreciate Keljin Blevins."
"‚ÄúBy god that‚Äôs Keljin Blevins music!!‚Äù - no one, ever"
Keljin Blevins sounds like the fake name Kelvin Benjamin gives to get back into Golden Corral after he got kicked out for eating the entire buffet line.
Keljin Blevins looks like a Lithuanian or Latvian name.
Keljin Blevins looks like if you tried to spell Kelvin Benjamin after about 20 beers
keljin blevins sounds like a name the fbi gives you in witness protection
bahgod thats Keljin Blevins music.
May I introduce you to Keljin Blevins?
"On a similar note, Dame‚Äôs cousin Keljin Blevins got signed by the blazers this year and he honestly might be the worst NBA player ive ever seen"
Keljin Blevins is where it‚Äôs really at
Keljin Blevins
Whole nba: Keljin Blevins  Worst player in a rotation: Jeff Teague
"Keljin Blevins, only on the team cause he‚Äôs related to Dame"
"Shoutout to Keljin ""I'm only here because Dame is my cousin"" Blevins"
Mario Hezonja and it‚Äôs not close unless you count Keljin Blevins but I don‚Äôt actually consider him a NBA player.
Keljin Blevins
keljin blevins
Game before last Portland played CJ Elleby and Keljin Blevins.
Yep and that‚Äôs why I fully expect Keljin Blevins to have a 20 pt game off the bench against us tonight lol
But who's guarding Keljin Blevins?  ü§î
You gotta go get Keljin Blevins from Portland too.
&gt;It was crystal clear he was the worst player in the league   let me introduce you to Keljin Blevins
Thanasis is at least Giannis‚Äô brother. Keljin Blevins is that his name? All them other nepotism signings I can think of at least share the same last name. Is he even a first cousin?
"Keljin Blevins is the only Keljin in the NBA, yet its still a tight race for the number one spot"
"Keljin Blevins is also the best Keljin in the NBA, amazing roster"
If they continue the trend of picking our former 2 way guys they'll sign Keljin Blevins next season and then the league is guaranteed fucked
Umm keljin blevins?
The one game we could have used Keljin Blevins...
Keljin ‚ÄúKelvin Benjamin‚Äù Blevins
The keljin blevins dude
Keljin Blevins. Most absurd name of all time
Keljin Blevins says hello
You gotta add Keljin Blevins to convince me
Keljin Blevins
Yea bro can't believe he can talk when he only scored 37 Keljin blevins would have dropped 50
garbage time legend Keljin Blevins
"Keljin Blevins, yup"
Is LiAngelo better than Keljin Blevins?
When Keljin Blevins sees the floor you know that mf is over
Keljin Blevins' cousin. What's his face... Raymian Billard?
Where‚Äôs Keljin blevins?
Keljin Blevins?
1) Keljin Blevins 2) Kyle Kuzma
"And Keljin ""Big Nepotism"" Blevins."
Luka &gt; Keljin Blevins btw!
Keljin ‚ÄúTyler‚Äù Blevins
not really a secret but the only reason Keljin Blevins is on the Blazers is because he is Damian Lillard's cousin
"Excuse me the Blazers Keljin Blevins, Dame's cousin, who put up 10 ppg at Montana State, is the ultimate victory cigar in the league rn"
Keljin Blevins and Deividas Sirvydis will always be worse.
"Posted the following yesterday. Markus Howard was at +10 MHP but he's now at +7 MHP in 105 minutes (2.4 MHP per 36). Yikes. I don't have the numbers to back it up but I think he's gotta have one of the lowest positive MHP per 36 in the league.  --------------------------  Even fuckin Keljin Blevins has +5 Marvel Hero Points.  To follow up, I looked at players with the lowest PER. The player with the worst PER is An≈æejs Paseƒç≈Üiks, who played 6 minutes with the Wizards and missed one 3, got one rebound, one assist, and gave up 5 turnovers for a whopping -4 Marvel Hero Points.  However, 6 minutes is almost nothing. Theo Pinson has played 33 minutes this season and accumulated -3 Marvel Hero Points, aka MHP (4 TRB, 2 PTS, 1 TO, 8 missed FG). Terrance Ferguson played 49 minutes and has -4 MHP (2 PTS, 1 TRB, 2 AST, 1 STL, 4 TO, 6 missed FG). Kris Dunn, who's almost been invisible for the Hawks in 42 minutes, has exactly 0 MHP.  Then there's Markus Howard. He has 10 MHP, but he's played 101 minutes for the Nuggets (3.6 MHP per 36). He got 33 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, 9 turnovers, 39 missed shots, and a missed free throw.  And then there's Josh Hall of the OKC Thunder. He's played 205 minutes, but has only gotten 24 MHP (good for a 4.2 MHP per 36, less than half that of the worst qualified player). That's because while he's scored 44 points, 32 rebounds, 22 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, he's also had 18 turnovers, 41 missed FGs (12/53), and 15 missed FTs (18/33). Just goes to show how badly a player would have to play to get negative."
"Keljin ""Big ""BlevGod"" Nepo"" Blevins' first missed FG in like what, 4-5 games? He is human after all"
"Keljin Blevins. He is a stud. His ts 27%. He is DAME COUSIN. He is known for his gaming, and sitting on the bench. His nickname is Dame's cousin, Nobody, and Somebody on the blazers."
Every player in the NBA is pretty good except for keljin blevins. But how good? Top 25?
Keljin Blevins and a 2nd Round from Portland seems fair.
I freaking love that Keljin Blevins being on a NBA roster is thing üòÇüòÇ.   Dude's name sounds like a computer generated name too üò≠  Let's Big Nep!
Or Keljin Blevins
NUMBER ONE goes to Keljin Blevins ^(for excellence in playing the role of dame's nepotistically aided brother).
Grizzlies may have beaten us twice before but tonight they faced the ultimate indignity: letting Keljin Blevins score
"Keljin ""Big Nepo"" Blevins might be hilariously out of place on an NBA court and comfortably the worst player in the league, but at least he keeps trying, and I appreciate that from him"
Keljin Blevins is a lot dude. Philly would have to throw in 3 1sts at the very least.
Keljin Blevins win the finals 4-0 for Portland with a Wilt like performance but accidentally hits his head on the rim while performing a celebratory dunk at the end of game 4. The impact dislodges the skull mask revealing it was an advanced AI who had been part of a massive conspiracy to take over the .....
Keljin Blevins is only in the NBA because he's Dame's cousin
Honestly I would definitely rather take a team assembled of the top 15 NCAA players than a team of:  Greg Whittington  An≈æejs Paseƒç≈Üiks  Will Magnay  Ashton Hagans  Theo Pinson  Ignas Brazdeikis  Keljin Blevins   Grant Riller  Gary Payton II  Jontay Porter  Malik Fitts  Oshae Brissett  Ray Spalding  Devon Dotson  Ty-Shon Alexander  Jalen Lecque  No coach ever plays all 15 players in a game so you only need the top 8 or 9 college players in the country. I guarantee that theres more than 8 college players in the NCAA who could enter the NBA right now and be better than the worst 15 NBA players.
Like Keljin Blevins?
1) Jordan Nwora - Bucks  2) Gorgui Dieng - Spurs  3) Ryan Arcidiacono - Bulls? (not sure if he was traded)  4) Keljin Blevins - not a clue  5) Tyrell Terry - not a clue  6) Brandon Goodwin - Hawks  7) Mo Wagner - Bulls  8) Oshae Brissett - Raptors?  9) Trent Forrest - Heat?  10) Wenyen Gabriel - Heat?
"Thanasis vs Keljin Blevins, who wins NBA's big nepotism award?"
Dame's cousin Keljin Blevins plays for Portland.
"Fair, and then we will trade you Keljin Blevins for LeBron+AD and a couple picks"
"You thinking of his cousin Keljin Blevins, this is the rapper Dame Dolla."
How about Kawhi for Keljin ‚ÄúBig Nepo‚Äù Blevins? Very tantalizing offer huh?
Talking about shit like Chris Smith (JR'S brother when he was on the Knicks) and Keljin Blevins (Lillard's cousin).  Thanasis definitely belongs in the NBA. He puts in rotation minutes for the Bucks. Even Kostas is pretty decent in the G League
What if I'm Keljin Blevins
"If we decide to protect Kanter or Keljin Blevins, I swear to god..."
Keljin Blevins
Which is why you'll also get Keljin Blevins
"Yeah to be fair that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs played six total minutes in three losses these playoffs.   He‚Äôs played the 223rd least minutes per game out of 230 players, beating out only Keljin Blevins, Tolliver, Amir Coffey, Rayjon Tucker, Yogi Ferrell, Frank Ntilikina, and Tacko Fall. That can kind of mess with the usage percentage - Rayjon Tucker is 8th for example"
"If Dame can get Blazers to sign Keljin Blevins, definitely possible lol."
Keljin Blevins next Blazers head coach confirmed
"Well they already put Dame‚Äôs cousin Keljin Blevins on the roster just for being related to him and he sucks, so this isn‚Äôt really surprising."
"Keljin Blevins, surely."
You're thinking of Keljin Blevins.     Different guy. He wore a headband for him when he got his contract.     Unless I'm being whooshed and you're just joking at Keljin's expense.
Keljin Blevins and JaVale McGee
Keljin Blevins
"Keljin, Blevins, Keljin Blevins, BlevGod, Big Nepo  No particular order"
"What about if he was in a starting 5 with Jarrett Culver, Keljin Blevins, Thon Maker, and Jahlil Okafor?"
Behind Trae and Keljin Blevins but ahead of Luka imo
I would loudly yell that Keljin Blevins is only there because of nepotism.
You obviously haven't heard of the legend Keljin Blevins.
"haha aww now you want it stop once you get thrown onto the spit roast. that's cute. you can stop commenting any time man, my vaccine immunity hasn't set in yet so I've got nothing better to do at 10pm on a saturday night.  1. you could also be in the NBA if you were 7'3 and mobile. It really is that easy. Obviously neither of us would sniff a max contract like KP but Keljin Blevins is on an NBA roster, a team would definitely take a flier on you.  2. I didn't diagnose you with anything? Another strike for your reading comprehension. 3. I only mention biology because you randomly claimed I didn't have a degree even though I mentioned going to school in literally the comment you replied to.    This entire argument has been you failing to comprehend what I write and then getting indignant about it lmao"
Same FGM as Keljin Blevins
"Simons, Kanter, Melo have been the 3 that have played most recently  RHJ has gotten some run during this series  Nas Little has shown some promise but doesn‚Äôt get much time  The rest are all varying levels of bad  Derrick Jones Jr, Harry Giles, CJ Elleby, TJ Leaf and Dames cousin Keljin Blevins"
you‚Äôre telling me you don‚Äôt know Trail Blazers superstar Keljin Blevins? Take that off that flair
I can‚Äôt even spell his name right! Keljin Blevins
The playoffs have been blessed with Keljin Blevins. We are officially going to the finals now.
KELJIN BLEVINS SIGHTING
This doesn't count as a win until Keljin Blevins hits a three
I bet my house on Keljin Blevins hitting a three today
Keljin Blevins
"How far would dame, CJ, Kawhi, and 13 Keljin Blevins go?"
"&gt;Keljin Blevins on Dame throwing him the ball: ""I wouldn‚Äôt come up to me on the court and throw me a basketball, because you know what happens‚Ä¶In these arenas, you gotta start lowering the hoop. We‚Äôll see what the NBA does."""
I did not come in this thread to read such baseless slander of Blazers legend Keljin ‚Äònothin but nep‚Äô Blevins. Good day sir.
Keljin Blevins
"Looked like Keljin Blevins compared to Duncan Robinson, Goran Dragic, and Khris Middleton"
"Keljin Blevins just giving other people a shot at winning MVP cause it wouldn't have been fair otherwise, what a nice dude"
Only 4 teammates between the blevgod (keljin Blevins) and wilt
"You missed the most important player on the roster, Keljin Blevins /s"
Tbh if the Genie just deleted Keljin Blevins from existence the Nuggets would have a chance.   Big Nepo is Overpowered
Winners: Blazers  FMVP: Keljin Blevins  Finals: Blazers 4-0 Wizards  WCF: Blazers 4-0 Spurs  ECF: Wizards 4-0 Nets
She's closer to Lebron than im closer to Keljin Blevins
Keljin Blevins
"Keljin Blevins. You can make an argument he‚Äôs the least qualified player to ever make the NBA, at least in modern history. If I recall correctly he didn‚Äôt even average 10 points in Division III"
"Portland would sweep in 4 games. We have Keljin ""Big Nepo"" Blevins doing shit like this:  https://streamable.com/mgy3rz"
"shoulda been KB  Keljin Blevins, nepotism NBA King"
Nephews thought he was there solely due to nepotism. This guy is no Keljin Blevins.
So Keljin Blevins to be 5x MVP?
&gt;The only way for us to make our kid not hate his last name is to make his first name even worse  keljin blevins parents
[Keljin Blevins](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/blevike01.html)
Lol tell that to Keljin Blevins
Keljin Blevins career is officially over
I meant Keljin Blevins you asshole
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
"Instead of RoCo, can I interest you in high used superstar Keljin ‚ÄúBig NEPO‚Äù Blevins?"
"WAR = Wins Above Replacement, basically how many wins are you providing more than a replacement level player like Keljin Blevins would.   [RAPTOR is 538's unique (and flawed) rating system](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-raptor-our-new-metric-for-the-modern-nba/)  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  If you sort by playoffs only, you see that Dame is still in first despite playing a 1/3 of the minutes of runner-ups Middleton, PG, and Booker."
Lakers should replace him with Keljin Blevins. I think he would fit into that role nicely.
He also provides hype to the entire team and gets the fans involved. He's essentially a d leaguer with a high profile last name that can get both the team and the crowd excited. Not to mention he showed a couple of flashes of legit NBA skill during the egular season.  At least he's not Keljin Blevins level bad!
"See Blevins, Keljin"
"&gt; he's there because of nepotism  That's obviously how he got here, but he earns his keep. You pointing out Keljin Blevins makes this point because there's a clear gap between what these players can do for their teams.  Team's have got 15 roster slots and there's 450+ players on NBA contracts; there's about 100-150 players in the league who you'd say aren't good enough to be in the league."
&gt; What‚Äôs your explanation then for the team‚Äôs offence pretty consistently being worse than the regular season?  So it's Bud's fault when Middleton goes into one of his ice-cold spells?  Or when Jrue hasn't been able to hit jump shots in almost any playoff game this year?  Or when Bledsoe transformed into Keljin Blevins every time the playoffs started?
We can offer a Blazers legend in Keljin Blevins? https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/blevike01.html
"Can't believe they had the foresight to trade for 5-time MVP Keljin Blevins when he was still just ""Dame's cousin the Blazers signed out of blatant nepotism"""
lmao you'd have trolls starting keljin blevins
"Jackson calls it a ‚Äúwhack.‚Äù Uh no, it was a shove and Murray landed in a bad position.  Whoever plays the Clippers first next year should  sign Keljin Blevins and have him go full sprint dive at Beverley‚Äôs knees. It would be doing the rest of the league a favor. He deliberately tries to injure people."
Who's that guy with Keljin Blevins?
Keljin Blevins- Big Nepotism
Keljin ‚ÄúBig Nepo‚Äù Blevins
Keljin Blevins
How much worse than Keljin Blevins can he be?
I feel like this has to happen eventually in the analytical era. Do we leave keljin blevins open and have a wide open man down court?
The unironic answer is easily Keljin Blevins
JorFraud will never be my GOAT  edit: it‚Äôs Keljin Blevins btw
"Hey, that‚Äôs Keljin Blevins‚Äò job"
"The disrespect. Our offense runs through Big Nepo Keljin Blevins. He‚Äôs the veins, arteries, the whole damn heart"
Keljin Blevins
"No baby I wasn't with her, I was with my friend uh.. Kel..jin uh Blev..ins. ?     Yeah Keljin Blevins."
"Keljin Blevins. But I always think it got messed up during the certificate paperwork, Kelvin Blejins would have been quite normal."
"I'm a bit confused that keljin blevins has apparently not been re-signed yet, like _what does it mean_????"
im placing my bets on keljin blevins for all 7 awards no bias
"He isn't good. He got drafted pretty much on his own merits and washed out of the league.  Probably would be a good hustle guy at a level lower than the NBA, but he didn't put up any good stats in Europe either.  He is capable enough that the non-garbage time Thanasis bench units still generally outscored the opponent - there are plenty of worse players in the league.  He is much better than Chris Smith or Keljin Blevins, as after all, he probably would have made league even without Giannis in the first place, just likely wouldn't have gotten any second shot without Giannis."
JR‚Äôs brother Chris I think.   Dame‚Äôs cousin Keljin Blevins.
If keljin blevins can get a roster spot I don‚Äôt see why LiAngelo couldn‚Äôt
"Jimmy butler, keljin blevins, Meyers Leonard, Lebron James, Pat Beverly"
Keljin Blevins sounds like someone was trying to type Kelvin Benjamin while drunk and blindfolded
Keljin blevins sounds like an NPC
"This is disrespectful to Keljin ""big nepotism"" Blevins"
"Keljin Blevins, Dame's cousin. Pure nepotism."
Keljin Blevins
I‚Äôd like to introduce keljin blevins on to trailblazers
"He rostered Keljin Blevins for a season, what more can he do"
Keljin Blevins should've been playing smh
"blazers legend keljin blevins, take good care of him no takebacks ok byeeee~"
Keljin Blevins on a minimum announced later today
Next up for the Sixers signing Dame's cousin Keljin Blevins
Keljin ‚ÄúBig Nepo‚Äù Blevins is still unsigned Morey
"I, as a government desk jockey, would be thrilled to have Keljin Blevins' career, let alone Tyson's."
Of course not. Trade them both to keep Keljin Blevins happy.
Keljin Blevins
Bucks trade Giannis for Keljin Blevins
Would Keljin Blevins start for them?
Keljin Blevins
Lmao for real. Keljin Blevins got his bum ass cousin a Supermax. I think the scrubs name is dame or something
Keljin Blevins
"Bruh bruh put up 27 on NYK, he's not your average benchwarmer.  Keljin Blevins on the other hand..."
"Oh I see, in that case it'd be Keljin Blevins, only because he's only on the team because he's Dame's cousin."
"No, that‚Äôs Brian Scalabrine.   Keljin Blevins is closer to me than he is to Brandon Jennings"
"Yeah but Keljin Blevins is not Brian Scalabrine  Brian Scalabrine spent a decade in NBA, 6‚Äô9. Actually playing rotational minutes for a lot of those years   Keljin Blevins is a huge case of nepotism bc he‚Äôs Dame cousin, he is one of the most unqualified player in the league. He averaged a whopping 2 points and 2 rebounds at Mississippi State for 25 games. Fucking Mississippi, literally the worst place in America bruv"
I think Keljin Blevins (god i cant believe thats a real name) is so bad and not an NBA level player that all of them would be in the G league simultaneously averaging 9 points on 34 FG% with like 4 rebounds and 2 assists.
Keljin Blevins GOAT
A fun experiment would be to give every team in the league a Keljin Blevins for 5 years and see which one ends up with the best player
Yo I bet I can give Keljin Blevins buckets. Idk about stopping him but I can give him buckets
&gt;keljin blevins
And Keljin Blevins so that‚Äôs good
Um.... that's Keljin Blevins sir and we take no slander!
keljin blevins likely the next MVP
Even Keljin Blevins?
"You've got old rookies like Keljin Blevins and the god-awful Chris Smith who have family ties with NBA stars, so they're trying their best."
Yeah but we also signed his cousin last season who put up 10.5 points per game as a senior at Montana State and listen to his input on resigning players and coaches (probably to the detriment of the team at times tbh)  Look up the legend Keljin Blevins
"We can beat that. We'll give you one Keljin Blevins. This dude is Dame's cousin, so you're effectively getting the guy you really want. Plus, he's taller. He's basically a super Lillard."
"We can beat that. We'll give you one Keljin Blevins. This dude is Dame's cousin, so you're basically getting the guy you really want. Plus, he's taller. He's basically a super Lillard."

"Okay Keljin Blevins, let's not cast stones from a glass house on how you construct your roster."
Keljin Blevins
Keljin Blevins
You talkin shit about my man Keljin Blevins huh???
76ers even have an open two-way spot for keljin blevins!
Yeah but is he better than Keljin Blevins?
Keljin Blevins?
Ahh the new Keljin Blevins
Keljin Blevins looks like someone's name spelt backwards.
We got Keljin Blevins reporting this?  Simmons future blazer confirmed
What if one of the players is Keljin Blevins?
"Keljin Blevins, end of discussion."
"Nah we're not talking about Keljin Blevins here, who by the way is still with the Blazers."
"Bench technician Keljin Blevins will update his resume, sources tell LinkedIn."
gotta hand it to montana state for producing darkhorse MVP candidate Keljin Blevins
So did [Portland](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/trail-blazers/damian-lillards-cousin-keljin-blevins-signs-two-way-contract-trail-blazers) and [New York](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/11/13/chris-smith-knicks-2-million)
Can you say Keljin Blevins without sounding drunk?
"It might not rhyme but it kinda slurs together, like you're talking with a numb mouth or something. Sounds like something you might accidentally say while the dentist has his hands in your mouth... ""Keljin Blevins"""
"Yeah at least Haslem was productive when he was younger for many years. He's 41 now, but Keljin Blevins is 25 and 100% ass"
Keljin Blevins is the WOAT and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise.
Keljin Blevins (Dame's cousin) exists
"Yo Nets, CJ Elleby and Keljin Blevins for Kyrie right now, let's do this"
Even in Keljin Blevins
Keljin Blevins about to drop ANOTHER 0/0/0/0/0 beauty. Who is this guy?
"Keljin ""90s Japanese Video Game Dev's Idea of an American Name"" Blevins"
*smiles in Keljin Blevins*
One day the league will just be Keljin Blevins after Keljin Blevins lol
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Blazers have only signed 13 players to the roster. The 14th spot is still open, and the 15th spot will remain open. Blevins is on a 2 way contract, is not the 13th man on the roster, and will not be the 14th.   ""Two-way players are ‚Äúextra‚Äù signings in addition to the normal 15-man roster for each franchise.""
