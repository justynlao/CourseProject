"Naz Reid gonna drop 55 on Feb 2nd, 2022"
"Dlo plays like he's James Harden last year minus the production and Rubio just... well idk but he's just not good. Plays hard in defense, has decent synergy with Naz Reid but everything else has been bad from him."
&gt; Which games were you watching?  I've watched all of Edward's actions from about two thirds of his games. [It's been a lot of this on his pick and rolls.](https://i.imgur.com/BWCCoaT.jpg) Dude owes Naz Reid dinner the way he's fucked him out of easy layups.
"I'm just here to say ""Naz Reid"""
can naz reid play the 4
"They don’t have any starting quality wings in a league where having versatile wings is as important as ever. Okogie, juancho, vanderbilt, and culver don’t start on other teams. Also I love Naz Reid as a development guy but if he’s your starting center you have problems"
"&gt; Powell might as well be the worst starting C in the league.  Nope. WCJ, DJ, Baynes, Thomas Bryant and Naz Reid if you count him are all clearly worse and then there's several debatable players in the same tier i.e. Zeller/Plumlee/Theis/Bagley/Gasol/Looney/Aldridge which is like half the non-star starting Cs in the league.  &gt; Dfs would be a bench player on most teams.  On most contenders maybe, and Dallas isn't one."
"Pretty much.  He’s got some potential to get better still too, especially his shooting percentages and defensive positioning.   I like the potential of vet Rubio starting and playing 27 minutes a game and D’Lo finishing playing 30.  Our team has 6 players aged 19-21 and 6 more 22-25.   Only Okogie and Towns were around 2 years ago, everyone else has been thrown together in this pandemic year without a preseason and then Towns went down after 2 games.    If the Timberwolves weren’t a meme people might notice that Naz Reid, McDaniels, Edwards, Culver, and Okogie are looking like solid NBA players.  We have the wrong system, but that’s a coaching change away."
Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
Naz Reid and Minnesota
"Tonight's lineup of the Wolves, coached by Ryan Saunders, with a, seemingly, still hurt D'Lo, no Naz Reid, no KAT, and a bunch of evenly distributed minutes between a bunch of super young players and complete fill-in garbage was just one of the most ""instant concede"" NBA teams I've had the displeasure of watching in years."
Naz Reid is out? Was looking forward to see him though.
"Naz Reid. He has a win share of 1. The Wolves have won 4 games total. Really, the lone bright spot of the season so far."
Naz Reid.
"There was a stretch in that game where the warriors just decided not to guard Josh Okogie and he just bricked like 4 or 5 threes in a row in consecutive possessions. Honestly felt really bad for him. I like him as a player.   Also, hope Naz Reid is okay, love his game."
I would really hope he could beat Naz Reid and [nobody cuz he was the only center] tonight
Wasn’t Ed Davis out too? So Naz Reid the only center available for practically the whole game?
naz reid
"I don't really understand SVG's reasoning here because Zion can score on anyone (except Naz Reid). Even Gobert doesn't stop him. Thus far I'm thinking that SVG wants to get Zion some ballhandling opportunities to develop that he wouldn't get with the starters, but it's a bit of long shot."
There’s a name for an injury for exactly what Naz Reid did to his wrist on that fall but yeah Mark Jackson go ahead and talk confidently on something you know nothing about lol

No shame in losing to Naz Reid tbh.  Pelicans really making people not look at whatever the fuck the warriors and mavs have going on rn lmaoooo
Naz Reid and Jarred Vanderbilt absolutely dominated Zion and Adams. Kind of nuts

##NAZ REID
"[Once again, the virgin Zion gets outplayed by the chad Naz Reid](https://i.redd.it/g92ubxrbl7g51.png)"
Naz Reid
"The Wolves weren't just sagging off Trae Young. They were screwing up their coverages all-around, not finding him on broken plays. KAT is better on defense than Naz Reid, but the perimeter defense was not the best either outside of just Okogie when he didn't get screened off. They had some help, but there is nothing you can do when guys don't know whether they're switching or not. They did bring help off the wing, but if you can't guard the action two on two, you don't have a choice."
"Something I would have liked to see today was Russell posting up Young over and over. Getting Young into the pick and roll, not hidden on Okogie. They started off with some of that, Naz Reid blew a post up for Okogie that should've been a layup and Russell got to the line posting up Trae. But it wasn't consistent even though they seemed  to have that in mind. Obviously they want to play for the three and that takes one of your three shooters out of it, but you draw help and maybe Okogie or JV can operate as cutters or screens when the double comes.      I've had my fill of the Ant posters. Can he just make the correct call on a shot vs drive against a closeout one time? Can he spot the open pass instead of trying to drive in? He missed Naz Reid on such an obvious play that we will probably complain about him not getting a call on. It was [this type of play](https://youtu.be/LvFWdubfQ5c?t=178) where you get an initial pick and roll and then pass to someone else who has a different angle to actually make the pass. Instead of passing to Naz who he was looking right at he drove in, took a tough, falling away shot and bricked it.      Zach Lowe and Mike Schmitz made a great point on the recent Lowe Post episode. Edwards does not need to be a star right now. He needs to operate within the system and take advantage of the opportunities others create. He's playing with Russell, Beasley and Rubio, they don't need him holding the ball to run a pick and roll. Catch it on the move or get into a handoff. Instead of wanting to start sets, be a catch and go player, attack after Russell or Rubio run a PnR and create a window. He's so big and athletic, he could even dive in a small-small pick and roll situation. But those pull-up threes? Beasley is a gunner, Russell is a gunner, there's no reason for Edwards to rely on that shot. Those forced dunk attempts? Just kick that thing back out or try a real finish. That second attempt was silly."
"??? BY DOING WHAT LMAO  im sorry. I love john. i really do, his defense this season with Capela is legitamitely very good. he absolutely deserves more looks on offense, some games he just doesnt get the ball nearly enough.  but?????? a vast, vast majority of his offense is finishing plays. he's not a guy that creates for himself beside the occasional midrange faceup.  breh was put in alcatraz tonight by naz reid  acting like Trae young isn't a massive reason why he became a 20/10 guy/will make $100m+ is just silly.  like dont get me wrong, wherever JC ends up next season (most likely atlanta, get ur goddamn grubby hands off spurs fan), they're going to need an elite P&amp;R guard/system to make the contract worth it"
Yeah that was needed.    Our young players are listening to him.  Now when we play with Rubio/Okogie/Culver/Vanderbilt/Naz Reid it is absolutely the best defensive team in the NBA....and the worst offensive team.  But my goodness they are a lockdown defense.
"But the guy's averaging 6.6 PPG on bad efficiency and average defense, he belongs on the bench even in Minnesota (Naz Reid is better)"
"It seems like we just pretend Naz Reid is KAT at times, and, obviously, it doesn't work."
"I’ve always said, NAZ REID"
[NAZ REID BLOCK](https://streamable.com/u6xdyb)
5. Naz Reid
"Naz Reid is not a great backup big in any respect. He’s legitimately pretty bad. He checks off some nice boxes, he can shoot, he can put the ball on the ground, but it doesn’t come together in terms of on court value.   Edwards has been struggling for awhile. He’s bad too. Both are inexperienced players, Edwards obviously to a greater extent, so that’s not surprising. But expecting Edwards to be good in any particular game is not a good bet."
"T-wolves look rough without Towns. Saunders seems a bit in over his head.  I thought Edwards would be better against us. Do like naz Reid, he’s a great backup big.   The turnovers in this one were out of control- lucky we won the game honestly.  The hawks have a few games here to get their shit together after losing all the western road trip games.  Trae and John seem to be getting along. All of the bigs have been great lately- especially capella and hunter.  Reddish has been missed on defense.  Cautiously optimistic about the hawks especially when they get Gallo and others back from injury"
Nobody is going to compliment my guy naz reid on that nice 3 pointer
"Bench production and the PF spot  Juancho is a black hole on offence and defence and Vanderbilt is too raw to start consistently  Then off the bench we have 1 real shooter in Naz Reid - Rubio facilitates but then Edwards, Culver and Vando cant shoot efficiently"
"[That's an and-1 for NAZ REID, right ?](https://streamable.com/0ddpba)"
[NAZ REID](https://streamable.com/x3x10f)
"nah man it's a massive difference, also the about canyon of a difference between KAT and NAz Reid is appreciable."
"The real story of the game is our role player’s defense being legit.    Replace Naz Reid with Towns having Vanderbilt, Rubio and 2 of Okogie/Culver/Edwards and we’re going to smother teams defensively in long stretches."
Naz Reid doing Naz Reid things
"[Nice of the refs to be on our side, that blatant double dribble by NAZ REID is kinda funny LOL](https://streamable.com/4tgukq)"
Naz Reid seems like he could be real solid in today's NBA
[NAZ REID !](https://streamable.com/j9pjk9)
And we don't have a real starting quality PF. We're playing four-guard lineups anchored by Naz Reid and Ed Davis most nights.  It's not rocket science why we're not succeeding.
"Wolves:   KAT  D'Lo  Beasley  Edwards  Culver  Rubio  Okogie  Naz Reid  Notable Unprotected: Hernangomez, Laymen, McLaughlin, Vanderbilt, McDaniels, Nowell"
"I love our guys. They aren't too over the top in seeing things with Wolves tinted glasses, they are pretty open when we get a bad call going our way.  That being said Jim every now and then has something set him off and he gets into a bad mood that will not be stopped.  A few games back there was a charging call on [Naz Reid](https://streamable.com/hlm7mt), it was questionable at best. But you would have thought the refs executed James Naismith on the court."
"Naz Reid was literally looking right at him and let that shit bounce right next to him? Nice pass, but damn, what the fuck was he looking at"
NAZ REID
"Kat, edwards, culver, dlo, rubio, beasley, okogie, naz reid."
I’d rather be starting him over Naz Reid right now

"KAT, Edwards, Culver, Naz Reid, Beasley, McDaniels, Okogie"
"KAT is hurt, our best defender (Okogie) is hurt, and our options at the 4 (Hernangomez and Layman) have been abysmal so far this season.  We are getting smoked in the paint and haven't looked competent on offense since KAT went down after starting 2-0.  Basically, we don't have a reliable 4 and we are left starting Naz Reid or Ed Davis at the 5 which is not ideal.  The team looks lost offensively with KAT being out and I attribute that to poor coaching. Saunders is the son of a franchise icon coach and people are starting to realize he wouldn't be in this position without nepotism.  Dlo has looked bad, but he is at his best in the PnR game, and Reid/Davis are obviously much, much worse at that than KAT.  Dlo had some success with Davis last game, Malik Beasley is a flamethrower, and Anthony Edwards looks extremely promising in the limited opportunities he is getting.  We can turn it around (hopefully) but KAT being out shows just how dependent our roster is on him to succeed."
Naz Reid is a massive dude. I was shocked to see how thick he is on top of being 7'.  That's a load to move right there.
"I'm so sad that I'm so sad when DLo is on the court.  Culver and Beasley stay looking nice, and I think I'm finally a Naz Reid believer"
"The calls have evened out a bit, and he did get a soft foul called on him, but the other two were legit.  One he pushed Naz Reid with two hands when going for a rebound"
Naz Reid.
"Naz Reid tho. Looks legit, was giving the Wiz bigs the work"
"The plus/minus stat in a vacuum might dumb sometimes, but D’Lo’s play on the court backs it up.  He’s not been the “doing everything in his will power to carry” like you’re leading on to. D’Lo has been legitimately hurting the team most of the time over the past 3 games, and is part of the problem ATM. Bad shot selection, ball stopper, lazy passes/live dribble, horrific defense, and just a nonchalant game where he’s constantly sinking the team’s morale to top it all off. Even the two games Towns player, D’Lo had the lowest plus/minus of all starters in both games.  While Naz Reid isn’t a starting caliber center, he’s player the role pretty well, though overall frontcourt has been a killer, I agree. D’Lo like I stated before is one of the biggest reasons we’re losing this badly right now."
"A1 from Day 1 has 14 points this game, along with NAZ REID with another 14 points. Silver lining, I guess . . ."

"Y'know, we've been playing sloppy today, but I'm happy with the half ending with NAZ REID clocking in 12 points, 6 rebounds and 2 blocks.  I'm not good at analytics, or even Maths at all, but anyone can tell that he's gonna get 24 points, 12 rebounds and 4 blocks by the end of this game."

"&gt;That being said, I hate how the Timberwolves offense is fucking STUPID for embracing too much of a trigger happy mindset (Ricky rubio, culver, AND naz reid ALL HAVE GREEN LIGHTS TO CHUCK 3'S?? SERIOUSLY?).  5 of our top 10 minutes getters shoot under 40% from the field.   3 of the 5 who don't have missed significant time.  Somebody on this team has to take shots to end possessions, and it's usually not going to be a good scorer."
"Even before he was drafted, the big question was: ""He's fast enough, strong enough, and twitchy enough to get any bucket he wants at will, but will that translate to recklessness or endless buckets?  That being said, I hate how the Timberwolves offense is fucking STUPID for embracing too much of a trigger happy mindset (Ricky rubio, culver, AND naz reid ALL HAVE GREEN LIGHTS TO CHUCK 3'S?? SERIOUSLY?). In turn, Ant has spent too many games taking 3's and buying into an outside-inside approach. It's obvious from his baptism of yuta watanabe that his biggest strength has always been his quick twitch, ultra attacking versatile playstyle, but it sucks that he's been kind of slow to embrace  an inside to outside approach.  Im a Laker fan tho, so I dont watch too many Timberwolves games so I hesitantly argue that I think the more 3's he trades in for drives to the rim, the better ALL his percentages will be."
KAT DLO Beasley Edwards McDaniels Naz Reid Vanderbilt  Then I guess you could spin a wheel to decide who gets to be safe because none of them deserve it. It would probably by Layman or Culver though
"Yeah I'm high on Vanderbilt but I don't know his role, he almost seems like a small-ball center.  Naz reid is the biggest question mark to me.   But watching Okogie he's off this season. I don't know how it will trend or if he will get notable playing time when everyone is back."

"Dragic’s a good choice for sure.   I’d add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can’t remember), Shake Milton’s should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"

"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
"That is Ricky Rubio (career 32% three point shooter), Jake Layman (career 31% three point shooter), Naz Reid (33%)  and Jarred Vanderbilt (25%) standing around the perimeter while rookie Anthony Edwards (who has less than 10 career post up possessions) tries to post up.  What's wrong with that?"
"Fine let's really take a look at this Wolves team then, and I'll acknowledge that they haven't been fully healthy that much, if at all this season.    They have literally zero reliable SF's or PF's to play big minutes (Jake Layman is a good bench wing, although not starter level and guys like Vanderbilt and McDaniel's will be good but still need lots of time to develop). Do not try to tell me either that Culver is capable of being the wing this team needs because he is clearly just not there yet.  Having a shockingly bad coach in Ryan Saunders for the majority of the season didn't help, and it wouldn't have made a difference being 'fully' healthy since his rotations and coaching decisions were wack.   The Wolves second best big man that comes off the bench for the most part is Naz Reid. I really like his game don't get me wrong, but to be a winning team in the West you can't have him as your second best big.  Constantly running line-ups of Rubio, D'Lo, Beasley and Edwards was truly hard to watch; and even just having KAT healthy and slotted in there wouldn't have made it 'that' much better. No defense whatsoever in that line-up."
Naz Reid snubbed. League will pay.
"Nationally definitely true. For our fanbase, we still value KAT to what he's capable of when healthy and appreciate his defensive improvement. Naz Reid is a great shout for underrated, improved every category this year including defense yet gets crucified for one bad game here or there"
Overrated: D'lo  Underrated: Idk honestly.  Maybe Naz Reid?
Naz. Reid.
And we have Naz Reid
"I don’t think Naz Reid is a better defender because he’s not, but he just puts so much more effort and heart into the game while KAT could care less and just wants to put up pretty offensive numbers"
exactly! This is why we should all know Naz Reid is a better defender than KAT
NAZ REID!!!
Naz Reid
No Naz Reid? This is bullshit.
"Brooooo imagine Naz Reid, Blake Griffin duo!!!! Domination!"
Ye Naz Reid elite but using +/- to state a point about Kat isn’t smart
OP uses FACTS and LOGIC in order to PROVE Naz Reid &gt; KAT
"His backup (Naz Reid) played 500 minutes last year and had a positive +/-, whereas Towns played 1500 and didn't. That's not a small sample size."
"honestly under normal circumstances a guy like Naz Reid should be on their g league team just dominating, but he showed out so far and he's never going back now."
"Well probably the real talent of that team (reid, nowell, others,) are all in the NBA because of injuries and a meh roster and have looked pretty good. Especially Naz"
"Raptors begging for Naz Reid...Twolves like, ""Y'all want a lightly-used Ed Davis?""  Honestly a Minny second would still be too much lmao"
Can we get a pick for this? Or naz Reid? I remember Orlando gave us a second rounds for an assistant coach a while back lol
Naz Reid slander will not be tolerated
"They have one great player and he's been hurt/out a ton since last year.  Beasley has been great, but when KAT was out they weren't gonna win anything with Malik Beasley, Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid as the 3 best players of a team."
"Naz Reid. He’s our back up big averaging 12 and 5, shooting 38% from 3. Went undrafted."
"Rosas has made good moves.   McDaniels looks really good.  And we stashed a top 15 pick talent in Euroleague on top.   Rubio for Johnson opened up Naz Reid minutes, and Naz is developing great.   Wiggins + pick for D’Lo had to happen.  The thing we got wrong was not making it top 5 protected.  But it had to happen.   Wolves went down when KAT went down. We were never going to be good without Towns healthy."
"Naz Reid staring down Yuta is kinda whack. Like, you didn’t dunk on him."
no please naz reid is pretty much all we’ve had this year
Would love the Raptors to make a run at him or Naz Reid in the offseason.
"fire saunders, naz reid."
Another great naz reid game i guess
Naz Reid?
"I'm trying to reconcile my thoughts on Saunders as a coach.  There are some obvious flaws in timeout usage, lineup combinations, etc. that have undoubtedly lost us a few games this season.  But we also have *so many* young players that are outperforming expectations this season.    Everybody thought Anthony Edwards was extremely raw and would need time to develop (which he didn't get because of the covid changes), but he has gotten so much better so quickly.  Jaden McDaniels was picked at 28 and was recently listed as the 10th best rookie so far.  Naz Reid has taken his offensive game to the next level in year 2, so now he's a threat to pickup 20 off the bench in any game and has upped his rebounding.  I'm sure it's possible that happens despite him, but it doesn't seem fair to give him all the blame and none of the credit."

"Yup, when one player is obviously and clearly better than the other, it’s harder to convince people they aren’t I.E Naz Reid &gt; Lebron is dumb and Harden &gt; Curry is dumb  ... from your lack of a response to my other comment exposing you as someone who didn’t watch basketball til at least 2015, I’m assuming you’ve come to realize that lmao"
"Some of us. Others, like me, watch the wolves and root for them. Maybe not many watch like me but hey man, DLo is always fun to watch. Throw in Malik the criminal’s hot shooting nights and also naz Reid and Vanderbilt’s rise have been good as well. Why hasn’t Hernangomez been playing?"
"No, you have no point. What you said was almost a non sequitur that contributed nothing to the conversation.   Even on a Naz Reid thread, LeBron &gt; Naz Reid in response to a comment comparing the two of them (i dont know why people would compare them anyway but you made this stupid argument) would be widely accepted because it’s consensus that LeBron &gt; Harden."
Try saying Naz Reid &gt; Lebron in a Lebron thread
"I’m going to add one that my entire fan base is going to hate me for adding.  Naz Reid, age 21.  In his second year in the league as a backup C, Naz Reid is putting up:    12.4/4.9/1.3/0.6/1.2 on .604 TS%, 38.2% from 3.   That’s 20.3 points per 36 on .604 TS%.  Naz signed a 4 year super cheap guaranteed deal with Minnesota last year.   So you get him for next to nothing for 2 years after this one.    You will have to overpay for Reid, because Minnesota has no interest in trading him.  But he’s a starting caliber C in the league already and should get better over time.  Why overpay real assets for a bench player when you can overpay for a young starting center of the future?"
"Fair enough. Certainly no debate on Saunders and Culver. I think the jury is out on the DLo and Edwards stuff until the team gets healthy and all plays together so we’ll see although you could absolutely be right regardless. On the other hand, some things Rosas has done well so far has been grabbing Beasley and Vanderbilt from Denver, signing undrafted Naz Reid and drafting Jaden McDaniels at 28 who have both been impressive."
Naz Reid is GOAT. I keep telling people that. Hope they'll listen now.
NAZ REID
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
Naz Reid
"He’s not a negative value, so that’s the starting point.  Someone worth their contract that is at least solid filler in a future trade.    We love McDaniels starting and Vanderbilt off the bench going forward, and Naz Reid is filling the rest of those minutes.  We just don’t have minutes for Juancho anymore."
Naz reid
Naz Reid
"Playing with the main squad. Should honestly be starting.   He can hit the 3 and attack the closeout.  Even made a slick pocket pass to Naz Reid when attacking from the corner last game.   Has a bit of a pull-up game (like all washington NBA guys), but its not a big part of his game.  Most impressive thing is he lets the came come to him on offense and keeps the ball moving. For a rookie, it's impressive."
This sub was talking about Naz Reid the other day and I wondered wondered why my team G league affiliate was being discussed

"Naz Reid in the Wilt category, he doesn’t count"
Below Naz Reid slightly better than McGee
Naz reid is one of the most overrated players by twolves fans. He is an undersized center that has zero defense. He literally is just an energy bench player that can hit an occasional 3.
"Memes aside, Naz Reid is actually pretty decent"
In Minnesota there is a term utilized to discuss all things in the world that are good.  That term is Naz Reid.
Naz Reid low key looks like Nene
Do Wolves fans think Naz Reid will keep getting his minutes and touches on the offense after KAT's return in long run?
at this point im supporting KAT and Ant as long as theyre in the league (and also probably naz reid)
"Youre fixated on this net rating thing.  Yes, we would ""magically"" win a game that we lost by 2 points if you replace Naz Reid/Ed Davis' minutes with KAT.  I dont even know how this is debatable"
"First off, Edwards isn’t even that bad. He made a bunch of clutch defensive plays last game. He’s not good but he’s not bad. And we are literally playing Naz Reid and Ed Davis at center. Go look at the box scores centers are putting up against the wolves. It’s fucking insane and KAT playing would sure up a lot of the teams issues.   We don’t need to be that great on defense when KAT is playing either. We just score a ton."
KAT makes a bigger impact than that.  We're giving Naz Reid and Ed Davis his minutes
"Okay, how about Buddy Heild for Naz Reid and yourUnprotected  OKC pick?"
"That’s a reasonable take.  But that is one on a list of things I see here all the time.  Top C, all NBA...he’s just left out of the discussion.    He’s a better scorer than Dirk or Durant but we haven’t fed him the ball like we should.  He’s as unstoppable in the paint as Embiid.  We *finally* started feeding Naz Reid in the post while Towns was out and I imagine that will continue when Towns is back.  It better.    If Towns gets 5 more FGAs in the paint against all these smallball centers his TS% and FGAs will go up.  I just don’t understand why everyone blames Towns for our bad offensive systems the last couple years.  He’s a good coach away from top 3 MVP candidate and everyone is acting like that dominant TS% is no big deal."

"&gt;I thought earlier this year it was all Saunders, now it's all injuries?  Because it wasn't just one thing but even with Saunders this team would be at least 22-30 if everyone was healthy.  &gt;I'm not saying he's holding them back. I just don't see how his role would be different when it's still a bad team.  His role doesn't need to change, he just needs to stop playing with Rubio,Josh Okogie and Naz Reid and start playing with KAT and Beasley..."
Naz Reid
"1. Injuries, this team played fully healthy in the first two games of the season but KAT's injury really derailed their season as a whole. We still don't know if the core of KAT, D'Lo, Edwards and Beasley is actually good because we have only seen them play for two games.  2. Coaching, Ryan Saunders probably made his gameplan around KAT and after he was injured he didn't have second plan. Hence D'Lo tried to carry this team but he failed miserably as only good teammate he had was Malik Beasley. (Anthony Edwards was pretty bad and inefficient.) He tried to implement a gameplan that obviously did not work, and he was fired after going 7-24. But in the great news, Chris Finch looks like he is a pretty great coach, at least after the ASB. The teams record is 6-10 after the All-Star Break and Edwards and KAT looks like completely different players. We knew what KAT was capable of but Edwards came in as a surprise as he is averaging 25 PPG with %54 TS after the all-star break.  3. While a trio of KAT, Edwards and D'Lo looks really good on the paper, basketball is a team sport at the end. Even if you score 60+ PPG as a trio every game, if your teammates are bad, you're not going to win the game. While they have great pieces like Jaden McDaniels, Malik Beasley and Naz Reid to an extent, other players are not helping. Jarrett Culver looks like he is a bust without confidence, Okogie is an offensive liability and Rubio, while his playmaking is still pretty good, he shoots %38 from the field. And the bad thing is I really don't know if they could fix this. We don't have a lot of trade pieces as our first round pick and second round picks were traded and I don't know if free agents would want to come to a team that is the worst team in the NBA.  4. KAT, Edwards and D'Lo are good, but their defense is really bad. To be fair, KAT and Edwards improved a little bit on that front, but they are still pretty bad. KAT improved his pick and roll defense and Ant gets a steal here and there but they just allowed 141 to an Indiana team that didn't have Sabonis, Turner or Brogdon. They are pretty [self-aware](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mmi27z/anthony_edwards_coach_cant_come_on_the_floor_he/) about their defensive problems and Edwards at least shows effort on that front but they still need to learn how to do team defense. We'll see if they will fix these problems in the off-season I guess."
"I've watched some.  Part of the reason is that Ant, while doing well on offense lately, has been a huge defensive liability and was an offensive liability as well for most of the first half of the season.  D'Lo was injured for a while and he is still very subpar for a starting PG, really is more of a bench player.  Awful defense and a bit of a ball hog on offense.  People underestimate how unathletic Russell is - just at a major athleticism disadvantage at PG, one of the least athletic PGs in the league.  He is exceptionally skilled, but terrible athleticism and low basketball IQ really hurt him.  Rubio as well was awful (out of shape) to start season and, while better lately, still not having a great season.  They also had a really bad coach in Saunders, very little offensive structure under him.  Offense has shown signs of life since Saunders was fired, but defense has continued to be a mess - if anything, even worse lately due to hot opponent perimeter shooting.   KAT also, for understandable reasons, hasn't been as good as previous seasons this year.  He is showing signs of life now, but he was injured for a while and wasn't playing at previous levels after coming back.  They have actually been pretty good at finding decent role players for the end of the roster - Vanderbilt good for a trade throw-in, McDaniels a good late first round pick, Naz Reid fantastic for an undrafted player.  Their biggest problem moving forward is that Ant and D'Lo are core players that don't necessarily contribute that much to winning.  They've missed on all their big moves, so their really good little moves don't lead to winning."
Naz Reid
Naz Reid = God
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
"Hmmm.  All of these have started games:   Naz Reid (21), Vanderbilt (22), McDaniels (20), Culver (20), Ant Edwards (19), Okogie (22), McLaughlin (24) and Beasley (24)   I wonder which of us actually had the youngest lineup this season?"
You had me at Naz Reid.
Naz Reid
Naz Reid is the NBA stopper
Wolves were putting Naz Reid and Jarrod Vanderbilt on him most of the night. It was bbq chicken for Jo.
"Yup  Terrible: Layman and Juancho  Young and Terrible: Culver and Okogie  Young: Nowell, Mcdaniels, Naz Reid, Vanderbilt"
except per the stats this is an on going thing every time these 2 play... you telling me naz reid has been on your team for years?
"KAT was on the perimeter because Naz Reid, the other big on the floor, is too slow to play outside.  ""Just look this shit up"" isn't a good way to analyze basketball, stats need context which your assessment lacks."
Naz reid is the jokic stopper
Naz Reid is the back up center.  Him and KAT have played a lot together tonight though due to the Sixers size though.
"Naz Reid, who is out there with KAT at the moment."
It’s Naz Reid but we’re running a big lineup rn for some reason
Still have guys like Beasley and dlo. I’m sure a team wouldn’t mind an okogie or naz Reid. Not saying they’d get anything of high value but the roster can definitely be reconstructed around Ant and KAT. Also mcdaniels has been really good lately at the 4 right?
Naz Reid
Let us not forget Naz Reid.
1. KAT  2. D'lo  3. Beasley  4. Rubio  5. Ant  6. Jaden McDaniels  7. Naz Reid  8. Jaylen Nowell  9. Josh Okogie?
Rosas. Turned RoCo into Beasley and the Nets pick which he turned into Bolmaro and Jaden McDaniels. Found Jordan McLaughlin and Naz Reid in the scrapyard.   The only blemish on his tenure was heading into this season without a real PF and drafting Culver.
"We got Jaylen Nowell and Naz Reid in 2019.  That wasn’t disappointing even though Culver hasn’t panned out.  Nowell turned the corner this year, looking great."
Maclauglin was offered the same deal discussed here.  Naz Reid and Jaylen Nowell are both on the 2mil year non-guaranteed.  JMac thinks he can do better.  Maybe he can.
All this just to beat Naz Reid
"This is not only an embarrassment but a very dangerous precedent if they let it happen.  Post all-star break literally every team with good players should find a way to 'sit them down to examine the players behind them'.  Wanna see Bradley Beal?  Sorry Raul Neto might be a developing rotation player in a few years.  Wanna see KAT? Naz Reid needs to work on passing out of the post, come back next season... and so on."
Naz Reid
Well that’s just wrong. Beasley and Vanderbilt are miles above Rubio and Naz Reid on the effort/heart rankings. Rubio had some of the worst body language I’ve seen from a player for the first couple months of the season. He’d arguably have been the worst on the whole team until February when he finally started to play decently. And I’d put Naz behind like 10 other guys.
Naz Reid gonna lock up old man James
"But choose to bandwagon the Minneapolis Lakers flair...  Compared to the mess the roster was in when he got here Rosas has done an excellent job and the only glaring mistakes were heading into the season with no starting PF and drafting Culver in 2019 (he can still pan out but its unlikely and he made up for that mistake with Jaylen Nowell,Naz Reid,Jordan McLaughlin and Jaden McDaniels).   Another thing you can blame on him was Ryan but Glenn clearly chose the signing there."
They’re better off getting Naz Reid because he’s a good center at least.   Edit: I don’t even think it’s a big deal anyways.
"I mostly agree. I think Naz Reid and Rubio can be good defenders but they need more pieces to surround them.  I have no idea what to expect from KAT on defense but the potential is undoubtedly there and I think if they had gotten Thibbs this off-season they mightve looked a lot better.  Yet the Hornets aren't too much better, their best defenders are the twins and Bridges. It's not like anyone on their team is a great defender."
naz reid
"Kat and DLO are great pieces, yes they are injury prone but are they worse than Hayward, I don't think so. Also the side pieces of Beasley, Naz Reid, and okogie are good developing players that Melo would make better. Plus the twelve have tons of shooting bigs that Melo has already shown he can work well with. I'll agree the hornets have had good health while the TWolves haven't in many years but just looking at the KAT Melo pick and roll with 3 shooters... thats a team that can compete for the playoffs. I'm not saying the hornets don't have better young players but looking at where players are at now, it's pretty close."
Naz reid
Extended Naz Reid-KAT lineup coming tonight lol
You forgot Jesus for Naz Reid
 Naz Reid is so much better than Jaxson Hayes
Naz Reid is nice tho.
Naz Reid looks the same.
Naz Reid
The other day I found out Naz Reid is 21 years old and my life hasn't been the same. Thought he was at least 32
Forgive me for my transgressions and then spank me as punishment while you wear a Naz Reid mask
I’m comfortable saying Naz Reid is one of the better backup centers in the league

Naz Reid makes basketball look easy
"Naz Reid seems like a super-competent, high-floor big. Hope he turns into the next Trez Harrell."
NAZ REID
Naz Reid  (im being honest)
Naz Reid
Naz fucking Reid
how would KAT bump JB out when Naz Reid is taking the freed up center slot
1: Anthony Edwards 2: Naz Reid 3: Jaden McDaniels   ...then burn the list
Naz Reid
Naz Reid for that 100% chance for the next 30 or so years
"Without Naz Reid in that list, I cannot accept your argument in good faith."
But can’t that be seen as a negative for Edwards? Lamelo has played most of the season with Bismack Biyombo starting who is definitely not a shooter. I thought Naz Reid was a good shooter?
The whole twolves roster except for Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid
"Yeah bro, The reason Lamelo gets more assists cuz he has teammates to pass to. Gordon and Rozier can both shoots, Bridges is his lob buddy.  Edwards' main passing options for most of the season were Malik Beasley and Naz Reid. And even when KAT came back, DLo and Beas went out, Making KAT the only player he could trust. The players around him matter.  His recent performances since KAT and DLo returns:  42 points, 7 assists, 6 rebounds  29 points, 6 assists, 9 rebounds  14 points, 4 assists, 9 rebounds,   19 points, 5 assists, 8 rebounds  So its not like Ant cant pass and rebound. When he has players around him that can actually do something, then his assists go up."
"We are already the youngest team in the league, and have promising players on the roster already. Having a big 3 of Kat, Dlo, and Edward's is a great core to move forward with. Throw in guys like Beasley, McDaniels, Naz Reid, and potentially a Mobley in the draft and were cooking. Rebuilding the right way takes time, and with our play recently on the court, you cant say the Timberwolves are an easy win right now. I'm looking forward to next year with the improvement of Edward's and Jaden."

"He’s at a 14.8 PER. The two players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Marcus Morris ($14.9 million) and Carmelo Anthony ($2.6 million).  He’s at 0.075 WS/48. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Duncan Robinson ($1.7 million) and Aaron Gordon ($18.1 million).  He’s at -0.7 BPM. The players sandwiching him on the leaderboard are Naz Reid ($1.5 million) and Kenrich Williams ($2 million).  The types of players in his salary range are Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis, Devin Booker, and Karl Towns.   538 estimates his 5/year value is $13.3 million a year. He really isn’t worth anything close to what he’s making. He’s turned into a decent role player this year, but decent role players don’t make $30 million, they make $10-15 million."
"Hi Mr Davis,  Big fan and had a couple questions,  1) what was the hardest adjustment you had to go through from college to your first couple years in the NBA?  2) who are the hardest guys to guard for you and can anyone hope to contain Naz Reid?"
Everyone knows Naz Reid the real MVP tho
Naz Reid
Your welcome. also...Naz Reid.
"naz reid - naz reid - naz reid - naz reid - naz reid. Naz can space the floor for naz, and naz has improved on defense. Imagine the pick and roll between naz reid and naz reid."
I think they trade their entire roster for Naz Reid and then building around Naz Reid. Naz Reid

naz reid
Naz Reid (undrafted)
Kids on r/timberwolves have hated on literally every player on our team at some point this season. Except for Naz Reid.
"Then proceeded to pick Nowell in the second round who's a nice rotational piece, Naz Reid, to an extremely team-friendly contract and Jordan Mclaughlin, a solid pg off the bench. Then comes back the next year and hits on Ant and Mcdaniels who have played huge minutes this year as rookies. I think he's doing a pretty good job personally."
Juancho and Naz Reid have been really good too
NAZ REID
"KAT,Okogie and Ant have been hits.  Culver and Justin Patton misses. But hard to fuck up 2 #1's lol   Our biggest success has been finding Naz Reid if I'm being honest."

"KAT, Okogie, Culver, Layman. Nowell, McLaughlin, and Naz Reid were technically Wolves players as well."
lol naz reid&gt;herro

Save the best for last. NAZ REID
Naz Reid
Naz reid
"If player has a talent he will develop everywhere. What players Wolves failed to develop? Wiggins? He was given all the opportunities here, and he is not better in GS now. Culver? He is a bust. Towns ended up being a bad player? I don’t think so. Edwards and McDaniels have shown huge progress this season. Naz Reid is a completely different player after 2 years, and he was undrafted.  Another question - who did Detroit, Magic, Cavs or Rockets really developed over last years? May be Hezonja? Mo Bamba? Aaron Gordon was expected to be a better player, though he is very good. Even Oladipo was not that great there, he became all star in Indiana later. Detroit were consistently selecting mediocre players in lottery - Stanley Johnson, KCP, others. Who they did actually develop so you can say - WOW, this player is really great? Rockets did not have high picks for a while. Cavs got couple in a row and their young players look good, though not good enough (may be yet) to say that the development matters.   You are just biased because Boston really nailed down their top picks with Tatum and Brown as well as their development and roles. However, there is nothing wrong with being drafted by Timberwolves. In addition, our new GM hired a lot of development coaches and all of recent rookies have shown a progress besides Culver."
Naz reid
Needs more Naz Reid
That's the thing its Naz Reid he can do anything
"MVP: Naz Reid, DPOY: Naz Reid, Most Improved: Naz Reid, Coach of the Year: Naz Reid Sr, ROY: Naz Reid, Sixth Man: Naz Reid, I'm not biased I swear"
On paper it should be fairly even tho. Towns&gt;Hayward Russell&gt;rozier Beasley&gt;monk naz Reid&gt; any center on our roster so aside from the obvious two rookies and forward depth the hornets have overperformed and the timberwolves have massively underperformed. It’s not really a significant roster difference.
"We’ve been hurt too. Dlo Kat and Beasley all missed a lot games.   Ant and McDaniels, both look very promising  But still rookies and can only expect so much.   Naz Reid a decent backup big  Culver looks like a poor mans iggy, Nowell had a solid stretch but than started missing games so he might be a good backup too. But otherwise yeah we need a defensive forward extremely bad."
"&gt;VIII) The easy fixes for Anthony Edwards  I continue to be bullish on Edwards. His growing chemistry with Karl-Anthony Towns has been one of the joys of the past two months -- how they bob and weave in concert, faking a handoff one way before flipping it the other direction. The return of D'Angelo Russell has interrupted that development a tad, but talent is talent, and the Wolves need all they can get.  Minnesota is 6-6 with Russell and Towns available. Josh Okogie rediscovered his confidence from deep, though we know how that movie usually ends. Jaden McDaniels is legit; the Okogie/McDaniels pairing is the type of defensive bulwark the Russell/Edwards/Towns nucleus needs, though I'm skeptical it brings enough shooting.  Meanwhile, Malik Beasley and his 20 points per game are missing; the Russell/Beasley/Towns/Edwards quartet has logged just 13 minutes. Such bad luck could only befall the Wolves.  Minus his nightly steal, Edwards has been bad on defense -- as expected for a teenager. It takes time for score-first guys to learn the complexities of NBA schemes. Barring some lack of will, Edwards should become at least an average defender.  He can start with the low-hanging fruit of transition defense. Minnesota is as bad there as the Kings, and way worse with Edwards on the floor -- in both volume of transition chances and opponent efficiency, per Cleaning The Glass data.  Edwards can be slow to realize when he should ditch his matchup and take the closest opposing player:  He sometimes meanders toward the offensive glass -- too halfhearted to count as ""crashing"" -- when he has little chance at a rebound. Edwards has 47 offensive rebounds in 60 games, so the risk-reward is not working.  Ambling cuts to nowhere can undo Minnesota's floor balance:  Edwards has good intentions: making himself available for the corner-to-corner pass. But Naz Reid -- having a very nice season! -- is already there, with two other Wolves under the basket.  This is fixable with experience and care. If we are having this same discussion in two years, it's a problem."

There is no wasting a Naz Reid game. Every game is a treasure in and of itself.
Honestly we basically just pray people stay healthy and admire Naz Reid from afar.
"Great Game/Series Kings!  Haliburton is so so freaking good!  Wish Finch was less creative and did the more normal thing with his rotations, and really with KAT/DLo played with more desperation, rather than their apparent cockiness.  I hate when KAT does his crazy sports center highlight attempts... JUST MAKE THE RIGHT PLAY.  NAZ REID PLAYS WITHIN HIMSELF.  KAT YOU DO NOT, and it fucking infuriates me.

Tough loss.  Wasted a great Naz Reid game.
He traveled and was out of bounds. Oh well. Naz reid
Naz Reid. Riley Reid. Either way I bust.
Naz reid is really underatted
The best part is the Twolves tweet with Naz Reid holding the Raid sign.
"It’s fine man, not everyone can be on the same level as Naz Reid"

"ANT is obvs a gifted player so thats a given. Naz reid prolly trains really hard and so he developed on his own.   Nevertheless, being at the bottom 2 of the conference while having three top 5 picks over the span of 6 years is inexcusable"
Honestly this excuse might not be true anymore. Naz Reid looks like a completely different player compared to college or even his rookie year. Ant has shown some real growth this year too.
Naz reid is the most underrated backup big in the league
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- — Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother’s death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  “This win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,” Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  “We don’t deserve to win,” Butler said. “Whenever we take these teams lightly, we don’t do what we’re supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It’s not good basketball.”  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West’s worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn’t let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  “Tough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “Total team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.”  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  “That’s tough to overcome,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.”  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame “With Liberty and Justice FOR ALL” warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks – the previous two teams to play in Minnesota – along with the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves’ website during Friday’s game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
"Sorry thought only reason for lots of minutes in regulation was ""Knicks players"". Yet there's a game where two TWolves played 41 and another played 44. RJ averages 34 on the season. He's not being run into the ground on a daily basis. If you looked at the game you cherry picked, we didn't have Burks or Frank at the time due to various reasons and it was pre Rose acquisition. So wow similar to KAT, we played RJ. Oh hmm and guess what Burks was not available today so uh we had to lean a bit more on RJ.  Also Naz Reid literally played 17 minutes in the game I sent you. Is he suddenly now not a backup 5?"

"You forgot Jaden McDaniels, Leandro Bolmaro, and our savior who will lead us to the promised land, Naz Reid."
"If I'm Portland I'm asking who they got besides DLo. Can't we do a 1st, Ant-Man, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, and Rubio's expiring for salary matching so I don't have to take DLo at 30 million for 2 year?, That way if I am blowing things up by giving up Dame I have a clear path to fix my salary table, and have good contracts to go after the next star that becomes available. At that point Ant is the franchise player and I'm shopping CJ and RoCo with picks and those plus contacts to get someone like Beal or a disgruntled star. I'm keeping Nurkic for now and seeing if he will extend for around the same salary."
Naz Reid
Naz reid averaged like 20 ppg per 36 and he's making 1.5 million for the next 3-4 years

Phoenix would be 3 - 0 if they had Naz Reid instead of Ayton. Change my mind.
"Jaden McDaniel and Bolmaro are 2 of the top 10 1st round picks + Ant.    Last year we missed on Culver but hit on Naz Reid with a long guaranteed contract and Nowell in the second round is solid.  MacLaughlin as an UDFA 3rd string PG has also been solid.    We also traded for G-League prospect Vanderbilt who’s been a great defensive/rebounding PF off the bench.    All in all we’ve been very good at finding bench players on the margin and hit on most of our 1st rounders since Rosas/Gupta took over.  Okogie is a top 15 wing defender in the league with limited offense.  So yes, he’s good.  But he’s a role player off the bench with that skill set."
Bobby Portis is just Naz Reid with anger management issues.

"It’s a draft not a top 30. Celtics, grizzlies, 76ers, Pacers have a franchis center. Celtics just drafted a center and have timelord. Naz Reid has been really good this season"
"Good in general except Coby is way too low, Rui is probably still mid-late lottery, Naz Reid is a bit high, and Gafford is somewhat high as well."
Y’all sleeping on Naz Reid 🤷‍♂️
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
Naz reid baby
The real story here is that Naz Reid this year is the Wolves all-time season leader in 2pt field goal percentage.
Naz Reid
"You almost have to throw the advanced numbers out when evaluating this Wolves team due to injuries and the resulting lineups it resulted in.   KAT missed 22 games. Russell missed 30. Beasley missed 35. That sometimes meant guys like Ant had to play alongside some BAD teammates in some BAD lineups. This was especially apparent early (when KAT missed time), when Ant was coming off the bench. There were tons of games where Ant was asked to lead a second unit of Jordan McLaughlin-Josh Okogie-Jarred Vanderbilt-Naz Reid. That meant he was either jacking up contested 3s or driving into a jam-packed paint. There were numerous games where he was something like 4-18 and it wasn’t because he was just jacking shots. The Wolves before the break were PAINFUL (they had the worst record in the entire league for a reason). Because Edwards didn’t miss any time and was there for all of those god ugly days, he’s naturally going to have a gnarly set of advanced statistics."
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
"I watched all of his games in Timberwolves uniform. Culver does not possess even one good NBA quality. He cannot shoot (even FT), cannot consistently finish through contact, not a good playmaker, may be decent (??) cutter. His defense is fine but not something extraordinary. About success in tanking teams - despite being one of the worst teams last 2 seasons Timberwolves never tanked. Started last season 10-7 and tried to win games after Dlo trade, this season everyone was injured (chance for Culver to step up) and eventually the team started to play well with Culver out of rotation.  Edit: Culver has had tons of chances. We tried him as primary PG, SG next to ball handler, SF, he even played 4. He was a starter, bench player, everyone. Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels and even Jaylen Nowell somehow used their chances and became consistent rotational players. Culver is literally the worst player in Timberwolves right now."

"He's a UFA, but taking rubio and naz reid probably isnt even better than having the cap space as an asset"
Naz Reid exists
"Most Wolves fans are realistic that there's no Simmons deal straight up. It will need to be a three team deal, where we send Beasley to Philly,  future assets +/- young prospects like Jaden McDaniels or Naz Reid to the third team, and the third team sends another good player to Philly.   The raptors, sending Lowry to Philly via sign and trade, is the most realistic possibility.   Philly gets an all star level point guard and another high level movement shooter to put around Embiid, Toronto gets assets for Lowry (who may be leaving either way), and Wolves get Simmons."
Wasn’t Naz Reid at LSU?
So Raptors get nothing lol. Fuck that if we’re making a deal with Lowry we’re getting more than Rubio and Naz Reid
How good is Naz Reid? I feel like Toronto might need a pick or two.
"Gonna need a 3rd team.   Perfect world for us.  Wolves get Simmons + Aaron Baynes  Sixers get Lowry (S+T) + Beasley + 2 1sts, 1 pick swap.   Raptors get Rubio + Naz Reid.   Gives us Simmons, Raptors get a mentor for Suggs and get away from Baynes.   Sixers get a real PG, a floor spacer and ammo if they are gonna make another run at a 2nd big trade."
"1. Beasley is not in jail  2. Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are both really good players on rookie contracts, both are guys who can be in the rotation of a championship winning team (McDaniels is honestly good enough to start on a championship team)  3. The team has every pick besides the one this year. Considering you can offer picks up until 2028 right now, the team could offer a max of 4 unprotected first round picks and three pick swaps right now (although that'd be a massive, massive overpay for Ben lol)"
"I fail to see the problem here, all he has to do now is pick Naz Reid and gold will be secured"
Elevate NAZ REID you cowards
Naz Reid
PG: Dlo/Patty Mills/McLaughlin   SG: Ant/Bolmaro  SF: McDaniels/Okogie  PF: Simmons/vet backup maybe James Johnson   C: Kat/Naz Reid/Dieng
Apparently Naz Reid doesn’t exist anymore
Naz. Reid.
It's because Trae and Zion aren't as good as Wolves superstar duo Naz Reid and Ant Edwards.
"No team but NJ would have KAT/Bam/Naz Reid/Kyle Anderson/Jaylen Brunson/JJJ, Kyrie also played his HS ball here"
"Yeah IK. We basically know that we cant do it unless we get a third team. Our idea there or there abouts is to give you Beasley, a pick and someone like Nowell, Okogie or Naz Reid if we're desperate whilst Toronto takes a pick or 2 + Rubio. You then get Lowry and we get Simmons.  In reality it'll possibly be a bit more. But our base is essentially:  Philly: Beasley, Lowry, a pick, filler Toronto: Rubio, a pick, filler Twolves: Simmons"
"Simmons is also not really the right personality for Philly. He is kind of passive and more of a shoulder shrug type guy that just is gonna keep pissing off the Philly fans. The trade is strange because Simmons is losing trade value for Philly because there is no way to convince the fans that just running it back is gonna be a good idea after the way they went out in the playoffs, but at the same time Simmons received an MVP vote last year so you can't just let him go just to shake it up. Simmons probably NEEDS to leave but the Sixers probably aren't getting equal value back unless it is multiple trades.   Here is the trade idea I have seen kicked around the Wolves sub.   Raptors-Wolves-Sixers.  Raptors get Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio  Wolves get Simmons and Baynes.   Sixers get Malik Beasley, Kyle Lowry and 2 Wolves 1sts.   Raptors do it to get the veteran leader in Rubio to come in and hopefully mentor Suggs (Mitchell and Edwards have both raved about how good Rubio is at helping them get up to NBA speed), also as an expiring they can restock next year they can possibly flip him. They get a super team friendly contract in Naz who has shown flashes and they get to not play Baynes anymore. Giving up Lowry is just a S+T so the cost to them is minimal to be part of the trade.   Wolves get their guy in Simmons, take on the Baynes contract and maybe he can show better here than he did in his disaster season in Tampa.   Sixers get a real PG that they can trust to take big shots and they get a knockdown shooter to help create space for Embiid. Curry doesn't need to be the only threat beyond the arc if they add Beasley. The 2 1st can be packaged together with some of the Sixers other assets or picks if they decide they need to make another run at a star like Beal."
"Interest is robust... at the right price. As a Wolves fan I want him, but not if we have to give up Edwards. I'd consider Russell, but KAT probably wouldn't  I love the possibility of a three team with Lowry and Beasley and Naz Reid as the major pieces going to Philly, but everyone else could try to loop in Lowry too."
Help us get Simmons and we can toss you a Naz Reid?
Nah we need a starting center badly and Naz Reid aint one lmao
"Naz Reid is pretty promising at center and Rubio is just depth for one year. If you can decline those options for $20M and you’re only taking on $20M, then why don’t you just do this trade *and* sign another center? Holmes and Allen aren’t locks to just go to Toronto at least you add some depth/assurance there"
"Unless we give up Dlo there isn't really a realistic way Wolves get Simmons without a 3rd team.  I've seen something like Beasley, Naz Reid, 2 firsts to the Sixers and then sign and trade of Lowry to the Sixers also.  I believe Rubio and Culver were thrown in there too somehow."
is giannis below or above naz reid at this point in time?
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
The trade I see getting kicked around the Wolves sub is... Wolves- Sixers- Raptors.   Wolves get Simmons.+ Baynes  Sixers get Beasley + Lowry + 2 1st from Wolves.   Raptors get Rubio + Naz   The Wolves get their guy.   Sixers get a real PG and a 2nd 3pt shooter so Curry doesn't have to be the only one creating space for Embiid. They also get draft picks they can bundle with their own draft picks if they decide that Lowry isn't enough help.   Raptors are only doing a S+T so it isn't really a big loss to them but to be involved they get a veteran leader that they can either work as a mentor with a young draft pick (Suggs grew up watching Rubio in Minnesota) or flip him as an expiring contract. Also Raptors get rid of Aaron Baynes and add in an intriguing low cost player in Naz Reid.
"They probably throw Rubio, Beasley, Naz Reid, and   maybe Culver at Philly and see if they’ll take it."
"No Giannis comes to the timberwolves because he decides that he likes the cold, watching the Vikings choke in the playoffs, and playing alongside Naz Reid"
"Three or four team trade where Minnesota includes rubio, beas, and some combo of naz reid, culver, jaylen nowell, and/or mcdaniels plus a first or two. This could be in a Lowry sign and trade or with various other teams moving on from a player Philly might be more interested in."
Nah.  Rubio Malik Beasley and picks.  If the Sixers are lucky....IF they may even get Naz Reid.  IF they ask nicely.

"lmfao you’re writing off injuries completely because they lost one game to a team with injuries? guess the utah jazz were shit then since they lost all 3 games to the wolves.   kat and dlo played like 5 games together out of a possible half a season after the wolves traded for dlo. kat then had to deal with another long term injury this season, as did dlo, and kat also lost 6 family members to covid. you think the wolves were in a position to perform at their best when one of their best two players are constantly hurt and even when their best player was healthy, was struggling with grief and depression? he even said he wasn’t focusing on basketball at all. also love how you cherrypicked the ant+kat/ant+dlo minutes because ant was actually healthy all season. can’t do that with dlo+kat, their two best players, so you had to pick someone else.   a healthy wolves team can make quite a bit of noise next year. dlo, ant, kat, beasley, jaden mcdaniels, naz reid, rubio are all quality rotation players and the first six all have room and time to grow, plus they have a competent coach and gm for the first time in ages. actually watch them play next year, you’ll be surprised"
His only dud has been Culver. He found Naz Reid in the undrafted pile and drafted Jaden with a late 1st.  He cleared out Thibs mistakes (I mean look at the roster he inherited and how many of those players are still NBA players) and turned RoCo into Beasley and Juancho.  He even wanted to hire Finch in 2019 but Taylor intervened and insisted on Ryan so you can't really blame Ryan on him.

"Idk, probably one where you’re asking dame to carry Jarrett culver, okogie, juancho hernangomez, Naz Reid, to the finals with only KAT as the help and no first round picks left or roster flexibility… so, nah."
Naz Reid is no where near a good defender…He has some potential and unique skills that make him intriguing but he’s essentially a bench player that tries hard
"The only reason I remember Naz Reid was from an old 2K save where he got 90+ rated, I knew he was in the league but I didn't know he was averaging 11 points in only 19 minutes, and his contract is great, definitely wanna follow him more closely in the future"
Naz Reid
"What if it were Culver, Okogie, maybe Naz Reid and some picks (all to the Blazers)?"
Naz Reid
"Right? I know it's different because he's in sports media but he's never been short of transparent that he's a diehard Celtics fan. Fans are always going to get hyped and gas up their team.  I mean, shit, am I arrogant for knowing for absolute certain that the Timberwolves are going 82-0 and KAT and Ant will be co-MVPs, Naz Reid will be 6MOTY, and Finch COTY?"
I really like Naz Reid. I admit I don’t watch many t wolves games but I thought he could play next to Kat.
"Kemba, Beasley, (Jerome) to the sixers.  Rubio and hill return to OKC (if that's legal) with picks from both teams  or take Naz Reid, Nowell or another young guy like okogie, layman or McDaniel's. I'm not sure Culver or Edwards seem gettable but maybe they are.   Simmons to the wolves.   It works cap wise but I'm not sure each team gets enough.  Certain each team values what they have more than each other so who knows. I did just throw this together so it could be ass. But I'd see why each team would be interested."
"Beasley Lowry, Naz Reid and picks?"
Naz Reid

Naz reid
Hey I said almost exactly the same thing!   NAZ. FUCKING. REID.
The Timberwolves one is okay but that's because we're the Lions of the NBA so we make fun of ourselves more than anyone else.  Naz. Fucking. Reid.
"Wolves sub ain’t bad. We have low expectations, are easily pleased at this point and NAZ REID."
"Really just with that pick. Nowell at 43 has been serviceable, flashing some microwave scoring ability, and Naz Reid has been one of the 15 best players from the draft and he was an undrafted free agent. But Culver’s been booty so far."
"honestly guy is from milwaukee ship him to minnesota, get okogie, a first, and naz reid and call it a day"
"How are you leaving out the second half of this Timberwolves dynamic duo? Naz Reid heading there too, let's go!!"
Why would we worry about that? We've got Naz Reid. Naz Reid.
Naz Reid
Timberwolves sub feels that way about Naz Reid.  They are 100% correct tho.

"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."

"Agreed. I think people are exciting about the TWOLVES and I am too but for AE, Jaylen, Jaden, Naz Reid. Are pick will most likely convey this year and on top of that we have KAT and DLO who can carry an offense"

"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn’t trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I’m okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
"And KAT was still playing with worse defensive lineups. Naz Reid is a better defender than KAT (if undersized) playing the same position on the same team and finished over 80 spots below him in defensive ranking, that shows the dearth of defense at almost every other position on that team."
"Robert Williams III finished at 341 and Naz Reid finished at 350 and no one is arguing they are worse than KAT. Minutes, health, lineups all matter in this convo but you wouldn’t know anything about those in relations to KAT because you don’t watch Wolves games (don’t blame you)."
Naz Reid
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid:(
"What is the wolves best package for another star?   Bev, Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Okogie?   Who does that get that the Sixers want? And then the wolves roster is shallow as fuck it just doesn’t make sense to me"
Spellman is basically what Naz Reid could have become but Reid got his shit together.
"No, not a potential all star.  2 potential all stars, 3 picks, and Beverly who’s a perfect fit in Philly.    Second, stop misrepresenting what I said and blowing hot air.  I said Naz was below that level as a prospect and Ant is far and away above it.  Ant put up similar numbers to Mitchell post all star break in his rookie season.  He’s absolutely above those guys in value and as a prospect.    Naz Reid didn’t suddenly lose all his potential to improve as well.    No one is paying more than that for Simmons."
You had to gave minutes to Naz Reid bruh after that terrible rookie year  It paid off lmao
"Ant is above that level.  McDaniels is at that level.  Naz Reid is below that level.  None of that is relevant.    Reid will be a top 20 C in the NBA next year at age 22.  You’re not getting Naz, a great shooter with all star potential in Beasley, Beverly, and 3 picks for Simmons.  There’s no world he’s worth that."
"We feel that way about McDaniels for sure, but not Naz Reid.    I know 2 other Wolves fans said that about Naz, but most of us understand Naz has gotta go to get an all NBA DPOY caliber player.    That said, Reid is putting up 21.0 PP36 on .599 TS% and was invited to select team USA for a reason.  You can’t have Reid and all the picks for Simmons, one or the other."
"Simmons to Minnesota, Lillard to Philly, Paul Reed, Tyrese Maxey, 4 1sts from Philly and Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, 2 1sts from Minny to Portland"
"Here’s a terrible trade idea  Philly. Receives SGA Jarett Culver, future 2rp from OKC.  OKC receives Minnesota’s 2022 1 rp,  right to swap a future pick, Naz Reid, a 2rp from Philly   Minnesota receives Simmons"
Naz Reid
"not a jinx per se, but i'm pretty sure the wolves fanbase *willed* Naz Reid into being a good player"
"He has had every chance he needs and continued to fail. I’ve never seen a player struggle so much with consistent play due to lack of confidence. Add to that a broken shot and you end up where we are now.  He couldn’t get minutes on a “shitty” wolves team so what makes you think he’ll magically get run on a deeper Grizzlies roster?  It wasn’t a Wolves thing, it was a Culver thing. We’ve had guys continue to grow who were taken far later in Jaden, Nowell, Naz Reid, and Jordan McLaughlin. Hell even Edwards showed development. And miss me with the “he was a #1 pick of course he’s good!” Like completely forget that his class was dumped on for a year as one of the worst of all time, bust potential in the top 3, no guarantee, etc."
"I dont think he is the biggest bust. I just dont agree with your point that being drafted by Timberwolves can affect the development. Especially during last 2 years, we did not really compete so we played a lot of young players on different positions and gave them a lot of chances. Naz Reid, McLaughlin (forgot about him btw), Keita Bates Diop, Kelan Martin came from G-League during Culver’s first season and all of them were better than him. Vanderbilt was in G League last year but finished the season as starter. I agree, sometime for a player is better to be a part of competitive team to develop. But do think that lack of playing time is more beneficial for players like Toppin or Smith (from Phoenix)?   EVERYONE from the players I mentioned has shown progress. Culver is still the same player he was out of college, but with confidence issues. Culver was given time on the court ONLY because he was 6th overall pick, and he played himself out of rotation.  Edit: McDaniels is a good example. Do you think had he stayed in Lakers he would have been better? Im pretty sure he is very happy to be in Timberwolves because he was actually given chances and used them very well, now he is a big part of the core and people dont want to trade him for Simmons."
"The argument about the franchise being shitty and it affecting development of young players usually comes from people who know nothing about Timberwolves. Yes, we are perennial suckers and yes, we frequently draft busts in the lottery. However, with the new management (since 2019) we have drafted (or signed as undrafted FA) and played Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, and Jarrett Culver. [We also drafted Bolmaro but we are yet to see his development in the team]. ALL of them have shown a development to some extend and all of them are way better players/assets than Culver.   Culver was given all the chances in the world. We even started him at PG during the rookie season. He was below average in his first season, however with some promise. He worked hard over the summer and came to the training camp in a decent shape, impressed the fans during the preseason games. He started last season as 6-7 man in the rotation. The team started to suck right away after KAT got injured, and Culver even started for some games. He has shown NOTHING. He cannot shoot, cannot be a playmaker, cannot finish with contact. His defense is mediocre at best, Okogie is a way better defender than him.   Culver reminds me of a poor man version of Josh Hart who has a similar skillset but does everything worse. I feel like Josh Hart is his ceiling if he really works hard and figures it out. At this point, Im very glad Timberwolves dont have to make a decision about picking up his option for the next year - paying 14+ mil to Culver in the next 2 years could have been a problem. I hopes he at least can play in the summer league, but he got injured at the end of the last season and did not recover. Wish him all the best, but not in Timberwolves uniform."
"&gt; He’s still young and he was in a shitty franchise. There’s lots of other top 6 picks who had awful first two years.  How did we develop KAT,Edwards,Naz Reid and Jaden into good players? It's never the players fault always the org....  &gt;There’s guys like this every year. The wolves also have a shit ton of young players and a bunch of guards.  In the 2019-2020 season there was a time where we literally had no PG on the roster and Culver had plenty of opportunity... The man has no confidence and that is the reason he busted."

"You can shit on our development but guys like Nowell, Naz Reid, McDaniels, who were all much later picks or undrafted passed him up real quick and have taken big strides every season. Culver just could never seem to put it together, but I hope a fresh start gets his career back on track."
"Naz Reid is a legit piece and you'd know that if you watched him play. A solid young big at only age 21. To win in the NBA you either need superstars or a roster with few weaknesses and he can't singlehandedly give you those things, but it doesn't mean he's bad or isn't developing well."
im talking about guys even younger than culver like nowell and naz reid
"Jayden McDaniels, Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, and Naz Reid tell a different story.   Four players who’ve developed to be better than Culver has been playing. If Culver still has a higher ceiling than those four, it’s no longer the Wolves fault he’s not playing better than any of them."
"He shot 50% from the free throw line, 25-30% from 3, and looked like he had no clue what he was doing. His defense was supposed to be solid but it wasnt. We like to pretend Naz Reid was our 6th overall pick not Culver lol"
"Uhm Pat Bev, Naz Reid and Ryan Saunders?"
"Which naz Reid has been for us, he was undrafted in that draft but made us select team this summer. He has been really good for us when kat has missed time. Doesn't hurt all the loss of missing with Culver but he helps."
"No team hits on all their picks. Rosas drafted Culver, Jaylen Nowell, ANT, Leandro Balmaro, and Jaden McDaniels. picked up Naz Reid as a rookie FA signing. Only 1 of those players looks like a wasted pick so far. Jaden is out playing his draft position and ANT is everything that could be expected of a #1 pick."
&gt;Yea Naz Reid doesn’t balance out a lottery bust   We traded #11 and Šarić who very clearly wasn't interested in being in Minnesota (also he was an expiring RFA and needed to be paid) for that #6 pick. From an asset management standpoint it wasn't that bad.  Also Naz Reid is very very good.
Yea Naz Reid doesn’t balance out a lottery bust
&gt;Jarrett Culver is 2 years removed from being the #6 pick and is now being dumped for Pat Bev. Another homerun draft pick by the Timberwolves.   It was a bad pick but come on we found Naz Reid in the undrafted bin and drafted Jaden in the late 1st round. Like Culver is the only decision you can point at that was bad.  Also Rosas was hoping to draft Garland but Cleveland gazumped us.
"1. KAT is a free agent in a few years, if they don’t at least make the playoffs before that date, he gone.  2. Without Ant Dlo Kat(all of whom won’t be moved), the package is Beasley Prince a few 1sts and maybe Naz Reid lol. If you want to build around towns, you’re gonna have to give up future assets my guy."
You'd really give up Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels like that?

"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
"Some of us hope Beasley/Jaden can be the headliners, though that makes less sense in this trade, and NAZ REID, every single pick, JO if they want him could be enough. It's tenuous and is a bit dependent on a guy demanding out and the FO acquiesing"
"2 firsts 2 swaps, Beasley which should result in a mother first from another team, Culver. can throw in some seconds for added incentive.  Maybe someone like Naz Reid or take a first out and swap in Mcdaniels."
Naz Reid for Miles Bridges 1 4 1 baby
Naz Reid on the loved team please.
Naz Reid
Nathan Knight and Naz Reid off the bench is gonna be sublime
Jeff Newton? That's a weird way to spell Naz Reid
"Timberwolves:  Jarred Vanderbilt is extremely replaceable and not worth $5 million a year.  Jarrett Culver should be ahead of Josh Okogie in the rotation because he has more upside on offense.  A team can never have enough offense, so signing Lauri Markkanen to a deal worth $15-$18 million a year isn't a terrible idea.  If we don't get a PF, Nathan Knight should start at C while KAT moves to PF.  Naz Reid is best suited for a bench role."
"Maybe not the best lineup but I think it gives us the most hope. Then we’d have Nowell, Beasley, Okogie, and Naz Reid off the bench.   Ant played a lot better after moving to the 2 and same for McDaniels at the 3, id hate to force Beasley in the starting lineup, slide those guys down and hinder their potential as well as the teams."
"Thats what I thought too, I saw Naz Reid a bit last season and I thought hey that guy shoots the 3 nicely  I always thought Nerlens Noel would be a pretty good fit next to KAT, he defends well and won't take too many shots away from the rest of the guys."
Naz is more a center and not great at d either so him and kat arent a great fit but if the option is lauri on 15 mil or naz ill start naz reid next to kat first.  Hell im not sure naz isn't just the better player period over lauri all lauri has is 3 point shooting and naz isnt even bad at that.
Isn't Naz Reid still on the roster? Is he not capable of doing a job next to KAT?
"I’m imagining it’d be DLo, Naz Reid (good backup center), picks, and maybe Malik Beasley. Then Philly can move the Wolves picks + their own picks for further upgrades.   Could 2-3 wolves picks and someone like Thybulle net you Jeremi Grant or Harrison Barnes? I’m not sure exactly what trade they’d make next, but I think you could do a lot with DLo, Curry, Thybulle, Harris, Embiid, and 10+ draft picks (7 from Philly and at least 3 from T-Wolves).   There’s no single move for Simmons (except Lillard) that makes the 76ers an sure-fire contender. As a result, I think they need to find a couple moves. Plus, I think DLo and Embiid fit really well together."
Thats probably fair value on our end for simmons but i just don't think Minnesota can trade both as we would have so little spacing for either simmons or Ant to do their work.  Minnesotas path to getting simmons has always been with a third team getting a bunch of picks and swaps and players like Jaden Mcdaniels and Naz Reid and other young non anthony edwards players going to the third team who are trading you guys the vets you want and Beasley probably also going to Philly which just isn't happening at the current moment.
"Oooooh, that’s not bad.    KAT/LMA/McDaniels/Ant/D’Lo with Naz Reid, Vanderbilt, Prince, Beasley, Noel/McLaughlin as our bench 2nd string.    Not championship level but LMA is a pretty damn good upgrade."
Naz Reid I assume
feel like a naz reid + jarrett culver deal could be nice for lauri
1. Naz Reid 2. Else
"Because it's not as simple as the w/l. He inherited a fucking awful cap and talent situation.   We traded Rubio with the intent of him being a veteran mentor as well as his expiring.   Culver was easily BPA at the time, no one expected him to have 0 confidence.   He also drafted Ant and Jaden, found Naz Reid, Nowell, Vando. And got Beasley off the nuggets scrapheap.  He was on the way to build an at least different roster, too bad he was a dickhead."
Finch is a good coach.    All of the terrible contracts are gone.  You can argue DLos contract is terrible.  That's what it is.  He picked up McDaniels and Naz Reid.  Nowell and Mclaughlin in the second as well if you care about young bench depth.    Gorgui and Teague money is now Beasley and Taurean Prince.  Watching KAT get doubled on the break and tripled in the post only to kick out to a sub-30 percent shooter sucked.  That was the situation that Rosas inherited.
Naz Reid went from too fat to get drafted to solid backup who can get up surprisingly high and fast off the ground and poster guys
"Best case scenario is probably Beasley, Prince and Naz Reid or sum"
"Trading up for Culver is the only objective thing he did bad on this list and he originally wanted to pick Garland but just misread the situation so his intentions were alright.  The only reason people say Dlo for Wiggins is bad is due to hindsight.  He improved so much in GS that maybe he's a better player than Dlo now but that wasn't the case when he got traded and there were no indications he would've been this good in Minnesota.  We also handed GS a higher pick than we should've due to injuries.  Edward's or Melo remains TBD.  I'm not saying that Rosas is a great GM but he made good on the margins move such as picking up Naz Reid, trading for Beasley and drafting good late lottery talent like McDaniels.  The team was trending in a positive direction under him so him getting fired is super baffling."
"Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, and maybe Josh Okogie and some picks or some shit.   I don't fucking know, just give him to us already. We'll be a dysfunctional mess, but at least we'll be fun to watch."
Naz Reid
"Starting 5: Jokic, Jerami Grant Middleton, Smart, Steph. Bench: Ingles, Patty Mills, Seth Curry, Caruso, Marcus Morris, Naz Reid, PJ Tucker, Jaden McDaniels"
"Trade Machines tell me that it's possible if Houston gets a contract dump of a bunch of players - Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe would work, with two or three first round picks as sweetener.   So many players means that a 4th team might be needed (OKC or Memphis or San Antonio?).  Basically:   Philadelphia: John Wall and Jaden McDaniels, some 2nd rounders?  Minessota: Ben Simmons, some 2nd rounders?   Houston: Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, Danny Green, Shake Milton, Naz Reid, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe + 2 first round picks.  http://www.espn.com/nba/tradeMachine"

When he had Naz Reid ahead of Kelton Johnson I couldn't bring myself to read anymore.   Pretty sure the guy who made team usa would go ahead of the undersized big with awkward feet.
"In the full article they have him at 24, behind Terence Davis, Naz Reid, and Chuma Okeke"
Our center position needs work.  Birch is fine as a placeholder but we need to develop a better starter for the 5 in the long run or trade for a project like Naz Reid or Alperen Sengun.

"Its fine actually. I contemplated about this today and realized I don’t want to trade our meme players for Simmons. Arby’s with Beasley, Naz Reid, you just lost to a team coached by a bird, and other memes are gold, they make my day. Would be great to experience something like Milwaukee once (I was in deer district [in Rubio jersey, lol] during the last game of the finals), but there is a certain beauty of being a fan of a miserable franchise. I have a friend in Minneapolis who is a fan of GS and he did not watch 19-20 season because Curry was out and they sucked. Everyone can support the best team, but I’d rather be loyal to my team and celebrate small wins like playoff appearance."
"KAT, Edwards, DLo, Beasley and McDaniels has the makings of a pretty darn good starting lineup, especially if Edwards really did grow to 6’6” and McDaniels puts on weight. Ant is gonna have a heck of a lot of space to drive with that many shooters around him.   My biggest worry with the Timberwolves is their depth. Naz Reid and Patrick Beverly are pretty decent bench guys, but they really need a second creator off the bench. It would be huge if the Wolves could trade for a guy like Kyle Anderson, who can create offense and fill in multiple positions in the starting lineup.   The Timberwolves lack of depth is a big reason why injuries have hit them so hard."
"I think D’Lo is on the table, but not D’Lo + picks.    Beverly + Beasley + picks, Beverly + Prince + Naz Reid + picks."

"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"It's really hard to gauge his value at the moment,  he has alot of intangibles that only cater to certain teams. I believe that and Morey seeking absurd offers to begin with, drove teams to other options, that has driven his value down some... maybe Naz Reid, Prince,  1 unprotected 1st and 1 pick swap."
"No, they wouldn’t. The rumors are that the Timberwolves are offering draft picks, Malik Beasley ($14 M), Jaden McDaniels ($2 M), Naz Reid ($1.7 M), and one of Patrick Beverley ($14.3 M) or Taureen Prince ($13 M). Those contracts combined match Simmons’s contract of $33 M.   Neither of those trades can be completed today though, so we don’t know if the 76ers would accept that offer. Taureen Prince can’t be traded till September 27th and Patrick Beverly can’t be traded till October. As a result, we won’t see any deal accepted until then at the earliest."
"Besides Ben, Beasley, or Naz Reid there's no one on Philly/Minny that's worth Cam/Gallo/picks. We already snatched Dieng from the Wolves so it would be redundant"

I know its minor but Naz Reid and Jaylen Nowell really improved since they came to the Wolves. I know everyone is gonna make fun of the Wolves and our misses (when we miss boy do we miss) but I think our training staff does a good job.   There is also pre ASB Edwards and post ASB which was a drastic improvement.
What if one of those role players is Naz Reid?
This checks out... I was trying to simulate 2k until the T-Wolves won a ring. Only happened when I turned the playoff format to Best of One.  Naz Reid scored 49 points to beat the Nets and win Finals MVP 😎
"I actually do think Blazers take Malik Beasley, Taurean Prince, 2 1sts for CJ McCollum, CJ's overpaid because he's forced to take a reduced role and they paid him for his talent level, which is greater than his role. Malik does 80% of CJ at 50% of the cost, for two more years then a team option, off ball. Taurean Prince is a feasibly switchable rotation player who gives you mildly efficient but not super productive play on both sides of the ball.   If you throw Naz Reid into the mix then you have a super young but productive backup big who is on a &lt;1st Round contract."
"As my last comment was about this, its also going to be a real struggle. Im still in the ""I hope it happens"" camp personally, but any team getting involved is giving up a near-all star or valuable player and getting back maybe 1 Minny pick and younger player, like Naz reid or maybe Milton/maxey at best. Like Kings would have to be Buddy and a whole bunch of other stuff to make up for the lack of real star talent. My previous example involved the thunder, who while they woild love to get more picks, (big memes, rite?) I dont think they are the 3rd team without giving up Shai. And at that point, it isnt worth it for whoever the 3rd team would be. Philly would probably prefer it to be a Playmaking guard/wing  so anyone wanting to trade a big are almost immediately out. A contending team isnt going to join as a 3rd to lose a core player and be happy with any of Beasley/Beverly/Prince or anything the sixers send out. Blazers could do CJ, but then to not get Simmons back in said trade seems silly. I wanted to imagine a world where Lonzo somehow was involved in it where Philly got Lonzo in sign and trade+McDaniels+2 MIN picks, Simmons went to minny, and Pels got Beasley+Prince+Some Philly Player and a pick or something. With no clue on the finances/Viability of that working, I assumed that something like this would happen (or be agreed to) around the draft."
"Naz reid is a nobody stop, and Beverly has barely any defense"
"lol  Naz Reid is about 3 times the prospect Maxey is.  Beverly is as good on your team as Simmons is.  Prince is a 40% 3-point shooting combo forward.  And 3 first round picks isn’t nothing.  Naz is a .599 TS%, 21.0 PP36, already top 20 center in the NBA who is 21 and on the best contract in the NBA.   You have no idea what you’re talking about.  Edit:   Turned 22 this week.  Happy birthday Naz."
I’m just going to disagree with that last Wolves fan.    My money is on Beverly and Prince to Philly and 3 firsts or 2 firsts and Naz Reid to a 3rd team with Philly assets for another piece.
"I mean, I'd do Beasley, Prince, Naz, 2022 + 2024 FRP, 2023 2027 swaps.   Two young guys, one a great (not elite) shooter, the other a rare super skilled offensive big (Naz Reid is likely to be 6moy sorta guy on a winning team), and a low usage high efficiency guy who is versatile on both sides of the ball going into his prime skill years, and then a bunch of picks.   I think this is a trade that both sides see real value in making. The only concern I have is I'm not sure what the 76ers roster number is right now, so I don't know if they have to send guys back to get down to 15."
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
Idk about Naz Reid. Might be giving up too much
"Wolves: Ben Simmons, Isaiah Joe  76ers: Kristaps Porzingis, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Tyrell Terry  Mavs: Patrick Beverly, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey"
"jaden mcdaniels, naz reid"
NAZ REID IS INTOUCHABLE
Naz Reid is MN Basketball
"At this point, Morey might have to settle for Jale Layman, Naz Reid and cash considerations"
"Similarly the Wolves’ Beasley, Beverley, Naz Reid and McDaniels are all very much debatable starters, Prince is decent and Okogie’s a gun on defense"
"I’d theorize it’s a mix.    Beverly and Prince to Philly.   Naz Reid, picks, and Philly stuff to Portland   Simmons and some small filler to Minnesota.     Philly pays the rest of the price and gets a couple 40% 3 point shooters.   They’re going to have to pay the piper though.  Simmons isn’t worth more than that at this point.    While Naz Reid is a very good young center and a piece to build with, I think Philly will be giving up the farm here."
"Sixers get Lillard  Wolves get Simmons  Portland gets at least two firsts from the Sixers, and three firsts, including a 2022 unprotected from Minnesota.    I won't speculate on what players the Blazers might want.  I assume the pool would be from: Thybulle, Maxey, Springer, Reed, Beasley, McDaniels, Naz Reid. I only include young players with potential if they got more minutes. If I'm Portland I would pick Maxey/McDaniels in this scenario but thats just me."
"Idk throw in another role player from Toronto or the wolves like naz Reid, and that’s definitely closer to his trade value than “1 all star level player and 4 firsts” like morey was asking. Lowry is an all star level player you know….     Morey reportedly asked for Wiggins, wiseman, and 4 first round picks (including #7 and #14 in this years draft for Simmons), and also asked for Lowry, FVV, OG, and the #4 pick in this years draft for Simmons. If anybody else thought his value was that high, then a deal would have been done by now."
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
"&gt; Besides that we have Utah, Dallas and uhhh Memphis.   First off, Utah isn’t a throw in they won 72.2% of their games last year.    And Minnesota is a wild card.  The Wolves were 7-29 the first half of the season after winning the first 2 games and Towns getting injured.  We were 16-20 to end the season and clearly should be better if injuries don’t decimate us again.     Our rookies started terribly last year, but post all star break (36 games)…  Ant:   23.8/5.3/3.4 on .567 TS%    McDaniels:   8.3/4.0/1.2 on .600 TS% (38.3% from 3).  Yes I know, he didn’t play enough minutes and only started 26 of 36 games.  But he’s our best defensive player and clearly poised to take a big step while only being asked to be a #4 option on offense.  You can’t leave him open, and you can’t put someone small on him he can score in the paint.    We’re also a front runner to get Simmons, but even if we don’t Vanderbilt is a good defender/rebounder who put up a .612 TS% as the garbage man/#5 option with 3.7 offensive rebounds per 36.  And we had an above average DRTG as a team when he was on the floor.    Our bench 9 man rotation is Naz Reid (.599 TS%, 35.1% from 3, 21.0 points per 36), Beasley, Beverly, and Prince.  Naz is the only one who hasn’t shot 40% from 3 in that group.    If KAT/Vanderbilt/McDaniels/Ant/D’Lo can just stay close with the other team, our bench should outscore the snot out of their bench."
Naz Reid
"His play style would be a good fit, but that contract is an albatross. Can't commit anything more than 20 million to a below 50% free throw shooter. Not to mention that he cannot play in the Beverly, Vando, Naz Reid, McDaniels lineup."
Naz Reid is 22 actually  Really nice post
"KAT is our best player by a country mile. Naz is extremely good for his contract size. On a team with good defense on the wing I think he could be a borderline starter. He’s not KAT, but nobody would expect to get a player as good as KAT as a third or fourth piece in a trade. Reid has a floor of solid bench rotation piece at 22yo and he’s improved his game each year at a bargain price.   He’s not going to turn your team around, but he’s a nice young guy to take a flyer on."
Naz Reid is not good. He only shines against 3rd centers when the wolves are down 20. He did awful in KAT’s absence
Bagley is older AND worse than Naz Reid.  There’s a reason Reid was invited to the US select team and Bagley wasn’t.  It’s because Reid is better and younger.  Plus he’s on a much better contract.    Heild is almost 29 with a career .406 3pt%.  Dude is a bench 3 point shooter starting on a bad team and scored 17.4 PP36 last year.   Beverly is a great on ball defensive PG and a .397 3 point shooter who is clearly a better 2 way player than Hield.    Prince is a 27 year old .411 career 3 point shooter who scored 15.5 PP36 last year…oh hey that’s pretty much Hield right there as a throw in.    There’s no world where Bagley is better than Reid and no world where Hield is better than Beverly.  Plus Prince.    But at least Hield is paid $24 million instead of $13 or $14 mil.
"The Kings can’t outbid the Wolves without Fox.  Period.  But that doesn’t matter because any team can outbid the offer it will take to get Simmons, and no team is going to pay a stupid price for him.    My assumption is (and this is just me) that Philly doesn’t want Beasley for his arrest/probation and the Wolves are therefore offering Naz Reid (.599 TS%), Beverly (.397 3pt%, .393 over the last 6 years), Prince (career .411 3pt%), and picks.    Obviously Philly wants to trade Reid and picks and whatever from Philly for another win now starter.  And since the Wolves can’t re-package Beverly for a while that’s ok."
Naz Reid looks like a broke ass Terry Crews.
Naz Reid is the best piece a 3rd team would want that we’d want to give up.  He’s already a top 20ish center and scored 21.0 PP36 on .599 TS%.  He’s super young and was taken by the USA select team for a reason.  That seems like the obvious piece we might give up with KAT and they might not want with Embiid.  We are not giving up McDaniels IMHO.  He’s exactly the right piece for us and his defense is also needed.
"""Naz Reid?"""
KAT  Ant  Jaden McDaniels  Malik Beasley  Naz Reid
"Towns, Edwards, McDaniels, naz reid and Russel,  Huh, my team only has 5 guysworth saving anyway lol"
I also forgot about Naz Reid who is arguably a top 5 backup center already
"If we’re considering players 25 and younger, I think the Wolves could be a part of the conversation. Not saying they are THE best young core, but KAT (25), DLo (25), Beasley (24), Ant (20), Jaden McDaniels (20), Naz Reid (21) is a pretty nice core. Two all-stars, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA, a potential future all-NBA player (Ant), a future all-defensive player (Jaden), and an offensively versatile backup center that could probably be a starter on a handful of other teams."
Anthony Edwards  Jaden McDaniels  Naz Reid  McKinley Wright  Patrick Beverly
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid.
Naz reid
"Yes, but…D’Lo, Prince, Beverly, Beasley, KAT, McDaniels, and Naz Reid all being good 3 point shooters will absolutely increase Ant’s effectiveness significantly.  Either you’ll have to leave a good shooter wide open all day or Ant is going to be driving on slower, less athletic players and having a jumping contest at the rim."
Nice name. Just like Naz Reid.

Naz Reid
"he both embodied the hype of his fans AND the sadness of his opponents, NAZ REID LEVEL EMPATHY"
"Calls in the T-Wolves favour I've confidently clocked was the no-call on the foul against Middleton early on (Bud got a tech for complaining), and Naz Reid having a foot out of bound picking up a rebound. Not saying they mean much, just what I've caught going that way so far."
Naz Reid?
NAZ REID
My GOAT   Naz Reid
Every team should want a guy like Naz Reid.
NAZ REID
"Surprisingly I'm feeling better about our defense than offense.  McDaniels, Vando, Okogie &amp; PatBev all look like good defenders.  KAT still fucks up rotations and gets annoyed at refs too much but he's contesting much better at the rim.  Ant also looks more locked in on defense and even Dlo looks like he's trying (he occasionally gets a good steal or two).  The main issue is our defensive rebounding looks terrible.  KAT, Vando &amp; Pat Bev are legit the only guys who know how to box out.  I see people blaming KAT for Valanciunas's big night yesterday and I do agree that he got bodied a bit on the rebounds but a least he was the only one who was trying to box out.    On offense it's a mess.  According to our commentators defense is apparently the only thing the team worked on in training camp and it shows.  We mainly just spam threes or have one of our main scorers try to freestyle something out of thin air.  KAT might legit be our best passer and while KAT is a good passer he's obviously no Jokic and if he's the main one trying to create for everyone your team likely has issues.  The most troubling is that Dlo looks like he forgot how to pass or even run a PnR and that shit is suppose to be the main thing he's undisputedly good at.  Most of our bench outside Vando &amp; PatBev has also been bad especially Naz Reid who last season was actually a legit good rotationally center but seemingly lost his touch this season.    Still it's only preseason plus 3 games so not a lot you can say for sure.  This is just my observations from a short sample size."
Holy casual in what world is NAW not a NBA player. My bad he can’t match Okagie Naz Reid and Prince lmao
Naz Reid is the answer.
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
naz reid time
The issue is that our frontcourt is really undersized. KAT isn't really a 7 footer and the next tallest players are McDaniels who is too skinny at the moment to be a PF and Naz Reid who although great is too slow footed to play at the perimeter. That isn't an issue against the Rockets who are also really small but against teams with big frontcourts you can't realistically trot out Okogie at PF or McDaniels and you need some actual size.
"I was pissed when we picked him. I wanted Coby White. We had 2 years hearing about how much of a work ethic he had. But seemed to do him no good. No improvement at all over the 2 years.  You can go ""lolwolves"" over it but we turned Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell and Jordan McLaughlin into legit rotational pieces in the same time period. Dude just straight up sucked"
Timberwolves are at 3 and they didn’t include McDaniels? Love Josh and Vando but Jaden is the Starter and the future. Also Naz Reid.
"No, that's Naz Reid"
Our third stringers (+Naz Reid) could've not caused the 30 point lead to shrink to less than 20 lol.
Does Naz Reid project strictly as a 5 or would he be able to play the 4 next to KAT at all eventually?
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
"Timberwolves is still kinda up in the air but it looks something like:  DLo  Edwards  McDaniels  Vanderbilt  Towns   And then a rotation of Beverley, Beasley, Okogie, Prince and Naz Reid  Depending on injuries and form we then will have Bolmaro, Nowell and McLaughlin coming into the rotation  And that leaves Jake Layman firmly out with our 2 way guys"
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
Naz Reid
And Naz Reid
"Kat, Ant, DLo, Malik Beasley,Naz Reid. I'd go Minnesota because of how deep of a team they have."
"Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, and Leandro Bolmaro vs some guy, who y’all got?"
"Damn, we got Manu, DWade, KD, and Naz Reid"
Naz Reid. Not even for the meme
I think they should trade Embiid for Naz Reid and build around Drummond

"Yeah, Joel for Naz Reid 😤😤"
Issa joke to us but it ain’t no joke to wolves fans. Naz Reid is their god
Naz Reid is going to average over 20 points per game at some point in his career. He averaged 21 ppg per 36 last season. Hes getting better at defense. He can finish. He can shoot.. he can rebound. He can pass. He can okay defense. Naz Reid.
Naz Reid
is there some kind of naz reid cult i can join
"tbh i only know who he is because someone made a thread about making a team made up of players from your state and it turns out that both KAT and Naz Reid were born in NJ.  so that seemed pretty solid at one position, anyway."

"Not to overreact to them going 3-0 in the preseason, but damn the team looks completely different than the poverty Kings of years past. The defense looks way better than anyone could've guessed, all the pieces are fitting well, they even have great depth. I'll break down the players in my opinion  FOX: 2nd best point guard in the league, could be 1st best this year, should have an MVP level season after coming back from injuries  Bagley: Unpopular opinion, but he's going to propel himself to the heights of players like Booker, Mitchell and Lavine  Haliburton: In my opinion the best rookie last year, I could see him averaging 20ppg this season easily. He also looks much better defensively  Hield: One of the best shooters in the league, need I say more  Ramsey: One of the best rookie defenders last year, has the potential to make an all defensive team this year, becoming the youngest ever to do so  Davion Mitchell: Arguably the 2nd best guard defender outside Holiday  Barnes: Great 3&amp;D player  Holmes: Elite defender and rebounder  Terence Davis: Naz Reid  In conclusion, I would be shocked if the Kings were lower than 5th seed in the West. The only rosters imo that are 100% better are the Lakers, Suns and Jazz. Discuss"
"I was going to disagree, but  &gt; Naz Reid: Naz Reid  Can't really argue with that. 82-0 baby"
Naz Reid is our Tacko Fall/Bol Bol who suddenly became a legit NBA player and keeps improving. Soon everyone will be aware of him.
Naz Reid is a valid point.
I really like how the NBA fandom in general is aware of the Naz Reid.

Naz Reid.
and the best +/- on the winning team?  Naz Reid
I am once again shitposting about naz reid on an alltime nba players post
"Speaking solely from the Wolves perspective. Naz Reid has looked good, Jaylen Nowell looked solid last night and Anthony Edwards took a huge leap defensively"
"Doug McDermott is like, a freak cutter.  I love Aaron Gordon, and Jake Layman is/has been a great cutter.  Willie Caulie-Stein has always been a cutting big I've had a soft spot for.  Naz Reid is coming along, his weight loss keeps adding so much burst and he's got such good touch on the finish."
You're forgetting Naz Reid. The key to all questions in the universe and galactic overlord of the NBA.
Naz Reid
"Play-in at the minimum. They have a nice starting 5 with what looks like D-Lo, Edwards, Towns, Okogie and McDaniels. Also having Naz Reid, Pat Bev and Beasley as a potential Lou Williams type off the bench is a plus as well. If Russell and Towns can both remain relatively healthy together then I really like this team, but that seems to have been their Achilles heal lately."
"Context matters though. If we say were about as good as a 32-win pace isolating the back half of that season we still didn't have   - Beasley, arguably our 3rd best player last season, for the entirety of that stretch.   - A head coach who literally was not on the team prior to this, in a year where practices were minimized. I mean literally that has happened like twice in the past 15 years where a coach is brought on mid-season from a different team.   - We relied heavily on two rookies in Edwards and McDaniels who did not even have an off-season and now have had a full off-season.   - KAT was absolutely in the worst shape of his career -- he very understandably didn't' do anything basketball related that past off-season (quoted as saying he didn't touch a basketball the entire summer/fall).   - We arguably upgraded on the margins. Beverly is almost certainly an upgrade over 2020-21 Rubio. Prince is a reasonably solid bench piece we added.   - Naz Reid  I do think that would at least support that we are probably closer to that 20-20 type team than the 16-25 -- well and definitely because Saunder was one of the worst coaches I've ever witnessed in my life and I am a 20+ year Timberwolves fan so that should say a lot. Finch actually seems legit.   I am incredibly pessimistic about the Wolves. I've been massively downvoted in our sub in past seasons in record prediction threads for giving record predictions that end up still being higher than what we achieve. But this season I really feel like we are, with full health obviously (or at least NBA-average health), a 38 win team. I really do think 41-41 is well within reach."
"I know it's a really small sample size, but last night, defense looked like the stronger end of the court. Anthony Edwards has been prioritized on that side of the game, and now they can throw out lineups with Pat Bev / Okogie / Edwards / Vanderbilt (or McDaniels) / and KAT or Naz Reid. Those lineups are gonna be pests defensively"
"Minnesota isn't actually terrible at player development, at least lately. You could see Edwards growth during the season, McDaniels looks awesome already, Naz Reid went from undrafted to one of the best backup 5s in the league, McLaughlin went undrafted and is a competent backup PG. But yeah too many failed draft picks in the past, so I understand the sentiment."
Naz Reid
"Well I'm not in the front office so everything I think I know is heresay, but I know two things: KAT and Ant are untouchable. Because KAT is better than Simmons and Ant soon will be imo. D'Lo is probably untouchable only bc we brought him here to make KAT happy. They're very close friends. It's possible they trade him but unlikely because KAT would be upset. It's def not a DON'T TRADE GENERATIONAL TALENT D'LO thing. As far as the rest it all seems like it's on the table. It would be a few picks (always value from the Timberwolves) plus some combo of 2 or 3 of players like Beasley, Beverley, MacDaniels (very high upside especially defensively), Bolamaro, etc. Really anyone. Even fan favorite Naz Reid. I think the picks are way more valuable than people realize bc we always suck and also we need a third team to make this all click. But who? Honestly i think we have the best odds of any team but those odds are 40% so I figure it's most likely we DON'T get him. Now...that said...Ant, Beasley, KAT and D'LO have only played something stupid like 10 games together and we finished the last 15 games of the season playing 500 ball even without them together. So I think with the team right now, if healthy, we could get 35-40 wins. Which sadly, for us, would be amazing. This is all without Simmons I mean."
"This often gets repeated (by myself in the past as well) but last year he showed the foot speed to play PF in lineups when he was with Naz Reid.  Thats why a lot of wolves fans wanted Myles Turner , that is until Simmons became a viable option.  If we miss out on Simmons I'd hope we could swing for Turner eventually though"
Antman AND Naz Reid confirmed top 10 all time.  1) Naz Reid  2) Anthony Edwards  3) Naz Reid  4) Anthony Edwards  5) Naz Reid  6) Anthony Edwards  7) Naz Reid  8) Anthony Edwards  9) Naz Reid  10) Anthony Edwards  They're not in the top 10. They are the top 10.
Naz Reid
Don’t disrespect Naz Reid like that
I was with you until you said we have to give up Naz Reid. You can't give up your franchise cornerstone like that.  Naz Reid.
"As a Hornets fan, I’d be willing to give Hayward to Philly if we could get at least one unprotected Minnesota pick + McDaniels + Naz Reid. Hayward played really well last year (best player on our team), but his timeline doesn’t match ours and his contract could age poorly. McDaniels/Reid would give us a great young core and some depth at forward, plus I’m not all that into Kai Jones/Vernon Carey/JT Thor as our Cs of the future.   This take will be more controversial amongst our fanbase, but I’d give Terry to Philly too if it meant getting Malik Beasley, Terry/Beasley occupy a similar niche but Beasley is younger and cheaper."
Naz Reid
The Timberwolves have Naz Reid. As such we win.
Naz Reid
"We actually have a very good bench. Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Beverley, McLaughlin, Vando. We're a lot better for bench players than people realize because they don't follow the team and don't know the players other than numbers that don't tell the whole picture.  As far as KAT being heralded as better than Embiid or Jokic...I think that was from earlier years when they were at the same level. I don't know many Wolves fans who'd say that now. I think his POTENTIAL is as good as theirs. But he has to get there. We were playing 500 ball for the last 20 games and we were still heavily injured. We've had horrendous luck on health the last few years. I think with Ant slowly becoming the man and a better coaching scheme we have a chance. But old thoughts and perceptions die hard. Also, we will have new owners starting next year so it stands to reason that things will change. For better or for worse? Who knows."
I’m probably trading everyone first before Ant.   Even Naz Reid.
Ant - Jordan. Naz Reid - God.
No one else could get away with saying it and not have their career fucked for it. Unless you think Naz Reid has the clout to call KAT's mental game weak
"Thankfully not! Sounds like the rest of the Wolves are all vaxxed too, so they aren't getting their hands on *Naz Reid* either haha. A very rare Wolves W"
Jonas &gt; Naz Reid bro Jonas is like a top 15-10 Center
Naz Reid will be an all star...after he leaves the Wolves (or with them if KAT leaves)
"Gummies a sec, I'll ask our new POBO to make a run at KAT and Naz Reid  ^^^^Naz ^^^^Reid"
not when Naz Reid extension kicks in
"Well, once it’s Embiid and Maxey as the starting PG you can remember what it’s like to lose all hope when Embiid wants out.    Because while I absolutely love Thybulle, he ain’t enough.  And Simmons was better in that playoffs than Harris and Doc.  Don’t worry about us, if Towns wants out after this year we’ll get a kings ransom for him and D’Lo and build around Ant with some great young pieces in place already.    It’s ironic you lot think Maxey is good but McDaniels and Naz Reid aren’t great pieces.   It’s like you’ve lost all ability to evaluate talent since Hinke left."
Naz Reid isnt “great” but the dude keeps on improving every single year in meaningful ways. I think a good type of player for you to look at are low drafted or undrafted players like FVV or Jimmy Butler. A couple dudes that were very reserved and focused on their role to start their careers and then as different events increased their confidence and their franchise’s confidence in them they blossomed as players
Naz Reid playing some sneaky good defense this year too
"Naz ""that mother fucker"" Reid"
"After watching so much Dubs it's funny to me to see you refer to 6'9"" Naz Reid as a small center when that's literally Looney's height and he's our only active 5."

Naz looked dominate tonight. Pure NAZ REID
"The Timberwolves are a terrible rebounding team and one of the smallest teams in the NBA even when healthy. And they were missing some key players including probably their best rebounder in Vanderbilt and another one of their taller players in McDaniels. There was a point in the game where 6'9"" Naz Reid was the only big on the floor with 4 pretty small guards. Sabonis is a great rebounder and kind of always destroys us in that area so this was inevitable"
Naz Reid the future

Naz Reid was trying to block him out with his whole body like a guard trying to box out Shaq. And they probably weigh about the same. This dude was swimming through kat and naz all night getting inside position. They literally had no answer.

"Disagree with some of these.  &gt; [Embiid pump fakes McDaniels into the air and leans his shoulder into him. 2 FTs](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/270/4c860fd2-17cc-38e6-b322-c26a1d633ba7_1280x720.mp4)  Hard to tell but it seems like mcdaniels jumps towards embiid, I think if jo didn't lean in it would have been a foul, but I think by the correct interpretation of the rules you are right, this should be a noncall or an offensive foul.  &gt; [Embiid travels, pump fakes Vanderbilt into the air, Vando goes vertical, Embiid leans into him. 2 FTs](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/382/6390625b-c8e8-8660-1204-0289bed30dc2_1280x720.mp4)  I don't see the travel here? The foul call is BEYOND horrible though.  &gt; [Naz Reid goes vertical away from Embiid, Embiid contorts himself into Reid. 2 FTs](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/681/b798a36e-e621-b599-4142-1ef8a59bad6a_1280x720.mp4)  This is not a good angle. It's hard to tell whether reid's arms are truly vertical, they may have swiped jo's arms.  &gt; [Reid gets his hand on the ball, Embiid flares his arms out as Reid and Prince strip the ball. 2 FTs](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/707/18a8f9ac-6759-76d6-ad07-bb3dbf558375_1280x720.mp4)  Again, a better angle would help, but it definitely looks like reid's left arm is fouling embiid's right arm pretty clearly.  &gt; [Embiid travels, pumps McDaniels into the air. McDaniels makes marginal contact with Embiid, and Embiid shoots after the contact. 2 FTs](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/786/9106fb98-bd6a-738c-1f21-540b58c4f1e5_1280x720.mp4)  Are you saying it's a travel because the first shot actually wasn't blocked? I think I agree with you, but that's a very hard call to make in real time. And I don't know how you call that contact ""marginal"", he jumped, his body fell into embiid, and then he leaned his arms into embiid's as he contested his shot (i.e. didn't contest vertically).  &gt; [Embiid wrap his arm around Reid's torso and bends over. Non-shooting foul](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/700/f08914dc-f88d-9d14-0844-2686b85355b3_1280x720.mp4)  Lol this one was silly. Agree with your analysis, dumb call.  &gt; [Towns pulls his arm away as Embiid goes for a rip through, maybe makes marginal contact. Non-shooting foul](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/239/fb590ff7-2b96-7650-1a5e-aea674a7053d_1280x720.mp4)  The (alleged) contact is honestly just not visible from this angle. Embiid's body/arms block KAT's left arm. The ref had a much better view.  &gt;[The ball bounces out off of Embiid in view of the baseline official. Embiid tells him it's Philly ball and the ref is like ""okay."" Minnesotta turnover](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2021/11/27/0022100292/809/ab0384f4-b86e-eae3-a54e-56c691432447_1280x720.mp4)  Lol don't even need to click this one. Terrible call. You're right, officials will often base out of bounds calls by how people react."
"This was after embiid was throat punching naz Reid when Drummond got the tip in, ant and vando both got fouled on drives with no whistle and iirc embiid got some cheap ones at the other end"
You don’t use Naz Reid to replace anybody - you build around him.
Naz Reid
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid
Sixers announcers astonished when naz reid hits a 3 like it’s his first of his career
Naz Reid stop doubling Maxey wtf
No KAT and no real big man sub. It’s been happening all year. NAZ Reid is not a center.
Naz reid pretending he has a black eye or suttin LOL
That was not a foul on Naz Reid.
Thats the Drummond i know and love.  Turnover on offence.  lazy ass D letting Naz Reid stealing an easy rebound and getting a easy layup
"I was high on this team during the off-season because Ants a beast who I think will be a top 5 player soon and I love the role players the team has acquired. Specifically Naz Reid.   But just like with Luka, I’ve somehow ended up liking a player that belongs to a fanbase that utterly hates my team. Just hope you guys don’t wolves up his early career with stupid moves from here on out. Like it’s fun to talk shit and puff out y’all chest now but if real progress doesn’t come soon the nba fan base will turn on him. The change happens quickly"
"Plus Naz ""GOAT"" Reid is undersized as a center"
Naz Reid
The answer is actually Naz Reid.
Naz Reid be with you.
You got yourself a thanksgiving brother. Naz Reid.
Naz reid is unironically an inspirational story and i love that man.
is r/nba about to catch on to Naz Reid ??
Smh sleeping on naz reid.
1. Naz Reid   2. Crunch   3. Vanilla Ice   4. Marney Gellner   5. That guy who jelly-bellied his way into KG's heart   6. Jim Peterson   7. Those Prince jerseys from a few years ago   8. Nikola Pekovic (need a backup for Naz)
"Towns, Edwards, Russell, McDaniels, Beasley, Vanderbilt, Naz Reid, Beverley"
Naz Reid is a good shout. One of the better backups in the league at the 5 imo. We aren’t winning a ton yet this year but Naz is really reliable.
Naz Reid baby!
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid
Naz Reid needs to stay healthy for another three years
Malik Beasley and Naz Reid for Myles
"Man, we're still averaging 14 total blocks plus steals, even without Clamps Okogie or NAZ REID playing. That has got to be a sign of good defensive coaching, right ? Maybe if we get the offense going, we may get a play-in spot. Lets gooooooo"
naz reid sends his regards
We have a backup center (Naz Reid). What we really need is an actually power forward.
"Every time I watch Naz Reid, it always looks like he's just going through the motions. There's no effort or intensity in his game."
There is no Jimmy stays in Minnesota. We physically couldnt afford to keep him.  Either way Naz Reid wins 2 MVP's
Naz Reid carrying?
"No, because in this universe KD, LeBron, Paul George, Naz Reid, Kawhi, Giannis, and Liangelo Ball all team up in Sacramento."
Naz Reid is 22?
"If you count undrafted players who signed their first NBA contract with a team, Wolves have 8 too ;)  Naz Reid."
Disgusting behavior. Myles Turner should be traded to the Timberwolves for Malik Beasley Naz Reid and a 2nd round pick immediately as a punishment for this egregious act.
"Makes our frontcourt even weaker than it is, and KAT is the higher ceiling player. Without KAT our starting frontcourt is Naz Reid and Jaden McDaniels."
Bro lmao y’all reach so hard. If he dunked on naz Reid that hard it’d be a poster too. This line has nothing to do with KAT specifically
"For real. I'll admit that when Fitz gets salty, he's unbearable as hell. But to say that he never gives opposing teams credit is just completely untrue. If you even just watched tonights game, he was practically gushing over Anthony Edwards for much of the game, and was very complimentary of Naz Reid too."
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid makes me explode randomly sometimes
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
*Naz Reid* looking great
Naz Reid
Damn Naz Reid is only 22
Naz Reid
Get your Naz Reid slander out of here.
Wait. No. They replayed the block on Naz Reid he grabbed the jersey. That's nasty.
Naz Reid.
"Naz Reid.   But yeah, throw Justin Patton in that list of disappointing picks for me too please."
"&gt;  jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick.  IQ was picked 3 picks before him and hes been better  desmond bane was picked 2 picks after him and outplayed him last night   &gt;naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too.  actually agree with all of this will always endorse naz reid would love to have him on the hornets  &gt;okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win.   he's not a rotation player? more of a sporadic player, on one of the worst teams in the league. not to mention offensively non existent?  &gt;he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick.   roco is the best piece in this trade if the goal is to win basketball games  &gt;youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no.  you act as if all gm situation are created equal and all of those guys traded away a first round pick the next year basically saying ""we are competing"" then won 23 games, thats remarkable incompetence  and his encore roster looks like it might win 20-25 again  and last i checked the objective was to win games and his tenure not only put the wolves nowhere near doing that, it put them farther away   that is why it is fair to judge him on win percentage when not only did he sabotage their future he managed to sabotage their present as well"
"It could work if we throw in a ton of picks to a third team if the Wolves want young talent to build around instead of potential late picks from a OG, FVV, Siakam, KAT core.  Could, but I doubt Masai would be willing to give up a lot for a win-now move like getting KAT when this is going to be a development year for the team.  It makes more sense for them to go after Jalen Smith or Naz Reid in a less costly trade given those circumstances."
NAZ REID NEXT VIKINGS QB
"yes youre missing everything good he did lmfao. jaden mcdaniels looks like the steal of the 2020 draft and was the best defensive rookie in the league as the 28th pick. naz reid was undrafted and has become one of the most underrated backup centres in the league, and he’s one of the best 3pt shooting centres too. okogie at 20 wasnt a world beater but getting a solid rotation player there is still a win. he traded roco, keita bates diop, and some scrubs (vonleh, napier, bell) for malik beasley, jarred vanderbilt, and a first round pick. he overpaid juancho a little bit (but $7 mil a year is certainly not horrible), but then flipped him and culver for beverly, which significantly improves guard depth, experience, and defence to replace rubio while giving up two players who barely belong in the league and no picks.   rubio trade was bad, yes. dlo in minnesota is significantly better than wiggins was in minnesota, and theres a very good chance kat wouldve already demanded a trade if dlo wasnt there. it was worth it just for keeping kat happy if nothing else.   youre judging a GM on win percentage? thats straight up idiotic. i guess neil olshey is a better GM than sam presti, or kleiman in memphis, or rosas just because he won more games? fuck no. the wolves just have had horrible injury luck the last two years, that’s no fault of the GMs and its really stupid to judge him on that."
"horrible take lmfao he was the best wolves gm in years. wasn’t incredible but he consistently made solid moves, the rubio trade and culver pick were really the only questionable ones, and he only took culver bc he expected the cavs to take culver, not garland. ill die on the hill of the dlo trade being not a bad trade even if it wasnt great, and pickups like naz reid, malik beasley, jaden mcdaniels, and others show he has a great eye for talent"
the role players are also not well rounded players other than naz reid. They have a large number of hustle guys who cant dribble or shoot playing big minutes in their rotation. It's not much of a surprise that the only guy capable of getting to the rim is Ant.
"To be fair, that was classic entrapment by Naz Reid. He actually baited the Clipper player into tackling him to the ground, thus it is rightfully his foul."
I'd take one Naz Reid as our starting 5 :(
Naz Reid catching strays and I won't stand for it! Thanks for having his back. D'angelo Russell is poop though. Jaden McDaniels is a project.
I’d love Naz Reid and McDaniels on my team.
"nah bro, Naz Reid is dope. I'd love to have him on our team"
"The overrated the hell out of it.  Thought Dangelo Russell was something he’s just not, when the world has known him to a volume chucker for years, and overhyped mediocrities like Jaden McDaniles and Naz Reid"
"KAT, Beverly -&gt; PDX   Simmons, Nurkic -&gt; MIN   McCollum, Naz Reid -&gt; PHI    include picks as needed"
Naz Reid.
Our defense was fine through 3 quarters. We were on pace to hold them below 100 after 3 quarters.   What hurt us was:  1) Our best defender Jaden McDaniels fouling out very early. Wagner went off in the 4th once McDaniels went out.  2) DLo getting hurt. Having to run a very undersized JMac out there for big minutes in crunch time just didn't work. Which is why the Magic's guards went off on us.  3) Naz Reid getting destroyed (and injured) by Mo Bamba. Still pissed that wasn't a flagrant foul. Fucking ridiculous.  4) The Ref's were so incredibly one sided for basically 3/4th's of the game. At one point the Magic had like 15 FT's to the Wolves 2.  5) Our offense is a mess. I think that's really the biggest problem. They need to figure that out before anything else.
Naz Reid was such a dog at LSU
problem is we also have malik beasley and patbev on our team lmao  thankfully naz reid cancels them out
"I’d rather just roll with what we have than trade PJ *and* Kai. Kai obviously isn’t ready to contribute now, but he’s got crazy potential. We’re playing really well this season, but we’re not a Myles Turner away from being a championship contender. Next years the point where I’d feel comfortable trading future assets for win now pieces.   I could maybe be convinced to do a deal around just PJ, but Oubre would basically have to be included to match salaries. I feel like PJ + Oubre + the Pelicans Pick for Turner is a pretty decent offer, especially since Turner has some injury concerns and has been on the trade block for years.  I’d probably prefer to find a smaller trade for a decent enough center though. Ideally we’d want to keep PJ as the backup center. My dream trade was gonna be Oubre + Plumlee for Steven Adams, so that the Grizzlies could clear cap space, but he’s been killing it with them. Another target might be Nerlens Noel, since Mitchell Robinsons has improved a ton this season. Naz Reid would also be a big upgrade over Plumlee. Maybe the Timberwolves would want both McDaniels brothers (and other stuff)?"
Naz Reid
Have you heard of our lord and savior NAZ REID ‽‽‽
Naz Reid
I thought that’s what Naz Reid was supposed to be
Naz Reid
Naz Reid --- KAT
"I made a video two weeks ago about 4 sophmores I was rooting for. Namely, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brandon Clarke, Tyler Herro, and Naz Reid. My vides  have been getting removed from the team subs for lack of karma but I thought some people in here might enjoy it. Please let me know if you have any comments or criticism.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPh9UEiFXs"
Naz Reid
Naz Reid
"I do feel like Mccollum to the Sixers makes sense, but Simmons to Portland doesn't. If they wanted to get funky, you could do Mccollum and Rubio to Philly, Simmons to Minnesota, and then a platter of Beasley, Maxey, Juancho, Naz Reid, and a pick to Portland. I think that would make all 3 teams better, but not many 3 team trades with that many pieces happen."
&gt;Naz Reid   We can't trade away our franchise player like that.
"Malik Beasley, Josh Okogie/Naz Reid and a 1st?"
"Ours was really bad when we had DRose.  Because you had this swarm of Rose fans that didn't give a fuck about the team, so they lashed out at everything and everyone except him.  Now there is peace in our sub because we saw the light of Naz Reid."
Naz Reid?
Naz Reid slander.
Naz Reid slander
Smh these guys don't know naz reid
Naz Reid slander
If Simmons shot like Naz Reid they would have been better than this
Naz Reid
"Agree with all of this.  How much do the Wolves value Naz Reid?  I wonder if they could do something like Smart, Thompson, Langford/Grant Williams, and maybe a pick for Rubio, Reid, and salary filler?"
"Very willing distributor. Once we recoverd some health, with rotations his two main outlets outside of crunch time were Naz Reid and Ricky Rubio the way our sets run. The kid made that functional.  Also as much as Ricky bricking Ants assists drove me nuts he clearly has his ear and Ant listens to his basketball wisdom intently."
"Not the Wolves sub, we just like French Dips and Naz Reid"
"Well I'm not sure how else to explain it to you. Lauri doesn't want to play here. Lauri is also a glorified spot up shooter, who can't play center, doesn't play like he is 7 feet tall besides like 6 times a year, can't rebound, and has only worsened since his rookie year. He quite literally forgot how to dunk for the last two seasons, which was his main rookie hype. He has no defense either.  Under no circumstances is lauri a better fit on the Bulls than Naz Reid."
"Lol, what? I'd way rather keep Lauri than get Naz Reid."
"s&amp;t for danny green, or s&amp;t for naz reid  aw yis"
I’d rather try for Naz Reid
"Our backcourt is decent but our wing and rim defense is atrocious right now. Pat and Troy are our best wing defenders and our only big man literally is Vuc rn. So yeah we desperately need a big man that can play defense.   My hopes rly are to land Danny green and sign and trade Lauri for Naz Reid. If we can get those 2 and then pick up some solid rotational guys on min deals, we got a real squad.  As it is right now, this team is gonna be just as defensively frustrating if not a lot more as last year but with better offense."
So now that naz reid has become a really good backup center. Knight can be the new fun end of bench guy wolves fans meme into being a good player.
Dlo Ant and KAT are all guaranteed starters. McDaniels has shown enough promise to be a starter at the 3. Beasley is a solid shooting guard who could slide around a bit depending on who is around him and we have our backup center locked down in Naz Reid. Realistically we could use an upgrade at the backup PG but it’s not really a pressing concern and we have a bunch of PFs who can fill in but aren’t starter level. There is a massive hole at starting PF though and it if it doesn’t get filled we won’t have any interior defense since we’ll be playing small ball 4s again and the was a disaster last year.
"The thing Rosas is the best at is value deals.  Naz Reid (UDFA) looks like a future starter and was invited to the select team for team USA, Vanderbilt (throw in G-Leaguer) has become a solid rotation level role player, Noel looks like he’ll be a rotation level player, basically he pulls good bench players out of thin air.     Collins is the obvious target, but we’re not the only ones bidding on him.  I think it’s still in negotiations."
Naz Reid
Naz reid and not even ironically.
Naz Reid please.
Sweet now we can re-sign Naz Reid
"Not into hypotheticals, but McDaniels is a highly coveted player on his rookie contract, a couple draft picks, Naz Reid has some value around the league too. Consider what a third team throws in too.  Like I said. Possible, but hard."
Same thing happened with Naz Reid and the wolves
Wolves had it with Naz Reid and a couple other guys and it’s worked out great
Vanderbilt and Naz Reid are not smallball and one of them will start next to KAT.  Neither is Juancho but he’s bad enough defensively it doesn't matter.    If we go into the year with what we have our starting lineup is probably KAT/V8/McDaniels/Ant/D’Lo
"&gt;It does, I watch a decent amount of Wolves games too because I actually really like KAT, I'm just not delusional about his abilities.  Have you watched us starting Naz Reid and Vando at C then? And when KAT came back? Did you not see us actually have a defence then lol.   &gt;It doesn't matter if they can't finish easily over him, if they get sent to the line they have much more expected points than if they were finishing at the rim against an average player. By your logic, every 7 footer is a good rim protector because it's always tough to finish over players that big  But he's not fouling them on every possession. That's a weakness of his and why he's not a great rim protector."
tbh I havent watched enough wolves games to have a feeling on Beasley or Culver.   How has Naz Reid been?
Naz Reid.
Naz Reid is borderline a top 10 player of all time…
"What other important players do we need to get? The biggest whole on the roster is PF and Green is a capable one.  As the roster stands Rubio,Beasley and Naz Reid are the 6th,7th and 8th man so its not like we need other bench pieces (I'd like to trade Rubio or Beasley tho at least).  Also like Jon said we can't offer him a lot of money anyway."
Shaq -&gt; Naz Reid
"Culver is the only pick their new regime has blew lmao they’re 4/5 which is a great hit rate. Drafted Naz reid Jaylen nowell Edwards and McDaniels. Malik Beasley is already out of prison he was only there a couple weeks (and it was the offseason). Trading for dlo was good b/c their FO got rid of Wiggins. He’s just been injured which is bad luck and happens. They have a winning record when dlo and kat play. Also their FO Is pretty good, they got rid of dieng Wiggins Teague contracts in one season (nobody thought they could get rid of either and that it would take numerous first round picks attached)."
Ant man and Naz Reid
Naz Reid.
I heard a rumour he’s just Naz Reid in a wig the other day
"You'll be there, and I'll be cheering for y'all, wearing my Naz Reid jersey proudly (if it ever arrives)"
&gt;implies Naz Reid isn't a Timberwolves lifer  unsubscribe
"Naz Reid and some change, then the Hawks can clear room and bring back Collins"
Naz Reid.
