Jonas Valanciunas
"Neither Jaren Jackson Jr nor Justise Winslow have played yet this season. Both Ja and Jonas Valanciunas missed 3 games of the 7 game winning streak. And of course they've been without young, end-of-bench players like Killian Tillie and Jontay Porter for the entire season."
"I can’t tell you how much these wins mean for this team and its fans. The Spurs for years have been Grizz killers, and finally we’ve begun to figure them out. But they spoil Ja’s career high 44 points in our season opener, which started off our season sour and we began 2-6. We took a five game winning streak into a two week park. Then we got SAS twice in a row to see if we got rest or got rust. Short-handed.  Injuries for Grizz: Jaren Jackson Jr, Jonas Valanciunas, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Jontay Porter, Killian Tillie, Sean McDermott  Spurs: None  First game: Grizz W by 17  Second game: Grizz W by fuckin’ 31  Grizz Next Gen, YOU HEAR ME?!?"
"It was weird as hell when they won the championship and the fans wanted rings to be given to all the guys who were traded away to win the championship.  Like, I get that we all loved Jonas Valanciunas, but the dude plays for a different team now.  If he had stayed in Toronto, the Raptors probably would have lost in the 2nd round.  If my gf dumps me for a better guy and they get married, I don't also get a ring."
"You're a Toronto fan. You of all people should know that Jonas Valanciunas did the same thing. Toronto had JV put on weight so he could better matchup with bigger C's. It's an even better example because Toronto had JV do this just before the game started changing and JV could really have benefited from keeping slim.  This isn't Shaq playing mind-games. C's putting on weight was absolutely what both players and teams did. You don't grow that much from just being lazy. Look at Shaq before and after. Look at JV before and after. Those changes are from plans being implemented.  Hell, as a Toronto fan you could even look at Boucher. There was constant talk of him needing to bulk up in order better play the C position. This talk has died down this year as he is playing extremely well, but even with his improved play the talk is how he can't guard the bigger C's and that's why Nurse is still starting Baynes. Toronto needs Baynes to get into form or they have no option but going small."
"Len isn't good so I understand it from that perspective.  What I don't understand is where the associated move is on this one.  Our center depth right now is a 200 lb walking stick, a $25/hour Jonas Valanciunas impersonator, and a couple of small forwards who have played minutes there with a small lineup."
"I read ""Jonas Valanciunas"", but for some stupid reason, my brain pulled up a picture of Anderson Varejao. Might just be tired."
"Jonas Valanciunas, and I still think hes a walking 22/13 given the chance"

Jonas Valanciunas
"yeah, but to be fair, in feb 2019 we traded Jonas Valanciunas (5th overall) for Marc Gasol."
"Yeah he's bad in space and defensive IQ both of which are more important.  There are players though kind of in this prototype who are kind of polarizing. Someone like Jonas Valanciunas is slow as hell but his dFG% is good, his teams defend the rim well with him on the court and they allow fewer shots with him on the court at the rim. He also does better than you think in the impact metrics defensively. There are smart people I know who will argue a player like this has gotten pretty underrated and that we blame them too much for their teams issues. Im not quite there but I can buy the argument he is somewhat underrated. Hassan Whiteside another classic ex, not just stuff like PER but even PIPM rates him shockingly high. It's a blindspot in the metrics probably but general perception might also have blindspots to gauging him somewhat."

"Speaking of his strength, I was hoping that someone would post a highlight of when LeBron just pushed Jonas Valanciunas out of the way to grab a rebound without jumping."
"I don't understand any of this... the Raptors just aren't very good anymore.  DeRozan, Poeltl, Jonas Valanciunas, and Ross all flipped into win now assets that walked. Why exactly are we expecting this team to still be elite? It's time to rebuild and retool. This will take time."
"I wanted to argue because Ayton or Holiday as the best 3rd option seems crazy but then I looked and it's probably true. I think I'd personally go with Holiday as the best 3rd option or Brown in Boston behind Tatum and Kemba or even Gallinari in Atlanta behind Young/Collins, with Klay injured there are very few teams with an all star caliber 3rd option.

"Amazing roster building by Jason Wexler. All the main pieces are 25 or under.     Even the elder statesmen of the team, Jonas Valanciunas and Kyle Anderson, are just 28 and 27. Future certainly is bright!"
The Raps trading away Jonas Valanciunas and Delon Wright for Gasol 2018-19 Truly an all in single season move that worked.
"He would still work now.   It isn’t like there are 0 slow footed bigs in the league. Yao was very skilled, great touch, great shooter, and insane size.   Someone that big and that skilled will work in any league. As it’s hard to justify that Jonas Valanciunas can put up 16-11 on great efficiency and being an overall positive player but Yao wouldn’t be able to work now."
"Yeah I agree Boston doesn't have the assets to make a workeable deal and I genuinely dont even think Boston wants such a heavy investment in the center position anyway. By all accounts, tehy are looking for another wing more than another C. But like if Memphis called offering like Jonas Valanciunas + Dillon Brooks + Kyle Anderson + 3 1sts (1 being Utah's, 1 being GSW) for Vuc + Fournier, I definitely think  Orlando should listen in that scenario."
"It's cyclical,   * Euros started off being underrated * Dirk paves the way becoming the first major European star. Pau Gasol soon follows as does Peja Stojaković. * GMs in the early 2000s want the next Dirk, spend high picks on players who are not good (e.g. Darko Milicic, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Yaroslav Koralev etc...)  * Euro players are now all busts again. * New Euro player makes it big (e.g. Tony Parker, Marc Gasol, Mehmet Okur) and the Euro hype begins again.  * GMs want the new international superstar/hidden gem. Instead draft busts like jan Vesely or not living up to their potential stars like Ricky Rubio, Enes Kanter or Jonas Valanciunas (all top 5 picks who failed to live up to the hype).  * Euros are back to being soft/not good again. This is why Porziņģis got booed on draft night by his home ""fans"".  * New crop of Euro talent makes it big guys like Nikola Jokic, Giannis, Porziņģis, Gobert and Luka dominate.  * Now GMs take a chance and take guys like Poku high in the draft.   Euros because there aren't as many are compared to their peers way more than an american player. The boom/bust scrutiny is 10fold it seems."
Jonas Valanciunas
100% agree what the fuck did i just watch. this is just as bad as that jonas valanciunas thing last week
a great game from Grayson Allen and Jonas Valanciunas!! love those guys &lt;3
Jonas Valanciunas.

One all star appearance is still a damn good player. Like Jonas valanciunas is probably a zero time all star and he's still a pretty damn good big man.
&gt; Serge Ibaka  Disagree but I can see it  &gt; Jonas Valanciunas  ?????
"Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas"
"Wiseman should not be traded, yes he could probably have gotten them someone pretty sick that was selling. The issue is that they have $35 million in a player that cannot play and they will not trade. Really the whole squad is just fucked because of the injury to Klay and that really hurts.   I mean possible scenarios could've been trading Wiseman for a guy like Jonas Valanciunas, Wiseman and a bench guy could've easily gotten the deal done and they'd have replaced a growing center with an underrated veteran center. Another good option would've been Oubre and filler for Harrison Barnes. That actually would've been a legendary trade and really reignited some classic Warriors magic with the 73-9 core getting back together.   Damn I really wish they could've traded Oubre and filler for Harrison Barnes"

Remember Jonas Valanciunas breaking Metu's wrist? Don't get your hopes up.
"People always say there is this ""happy medium"" and ""middle ground"" they want without ever really saying what is with much clarity. Here is what has and hasnt changed   1) Assisted mid range 2s have fallen off a cliff. They have been replaced with assisted 3s. Is the pick and pop 18 footer as opposed to the 3 the key to solving the issues these people have? Not buying that   2) Unassisted mid range 2s have largely stayed the same   3) Drives per game are way up from 2014 even. Is the key to people's lack of satisfaction too many drives to the paint and basket? I think not  4) Shots in the 4-14 ft area short mid range are almost identical to 20 yrs ago  5) Post ups are way down from 2014. This is the big one. And the issue is this......certain post up players are very fun to watch. Most arent. Even the ones who are pretty good at it the fix these fans are asking for is not more Jonas Valanciunas hook shots.   When you really try to pin down what exactly the change is you see the flaws with any approach whether its the current one or alternative one. And alot of these alternate proposals do things like hurt spacing which people dont realize is part of what makes the game better to watch."

"   &gt;Russell Westbrook has been accused over the years of ""padding"" stats by grabbing rebounds from teammates. Offensive rebounds are much harder to fake. This year he is averaging 11.6 total rebounds, vs last years 7.9. But the rub is that his offensive rebounds have dropped from 1.8 to 1.7.  Fantastic analysis and point. Russell Westbrook, 6'3 point guard does not have the 2nd most rebounds in the league. He is tragically being beaten by the likes of 6'10 Jonas Valanciunas and 7'1 Rudy Gobert. It'd be a shame if someone realized that RUSSELL WESTBROOK IS 6'3. Easier to fake? It's ridiculous for a 6'3 Guard to be top 50 in ORebounding, DRebounding is much easier and height is less of a factor."

"Ther are a lot of win now players in the range of $18m or less  Rozier, Derrick White, Christian Wood, Jonas Valanciunas, and Steven Adams are all good players on non-contenders that would help the Warriors be very good. I can definitely see that package not only netting one of these dudes, but potentially get an extra draft asset back in return.  If the Pacers decide to retool/rebuild due to missing the playoffs, they could conceivably trade for Myles Turner, TJ Warren, Caris LeVert, or even Sabonis potentially  They would have to throw in one of their minimum players to get Sabonis, as his salary is slightly above $18m, but it would definitely be a worthwhile trade if the Pacers are willing. Same goes for other good players like Buddy Hield or Jerami Grant."
"Wiseman and a likely top 5 pick can definitely get you Myles Turner or Jonas Valanciunas or someone of that caliber, who would *absolutely* move the needle for them."

Yes our best 3 point shooter is Jonas Valanciunas
"You're right I don't remember ""all of this shit"". I was 10 years old when they lost the double OT game to the spurs.  But from a quick search about it, it didn't seem as big an issue as you suggest, Ed Davis seemed perfectly fine with it  [https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani](https://nationalpost.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors-ed-davis-thinks-dwane-casey-was-right-to-stick-with-andrea-bargnani)  It speaks to a larger point in which I do think Casey who was respected and well liked by the players, and who motivated the players to play with maximum effort. In many ways I see similarities (and shortcomings) with him and Thibs (and the difference in results between the knicks and pistons this year is mainly due to roster construction).  As to your points, while there was probably so tension between kyle and casey after losing again in the playoffs but at the same time both have said publicly that they've maintained a good relationship.  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2775591-kyle-lowry-calls-dwane-casey-1-of-the-best-coaches-ive-ever-had-after-firing)  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2774975-demar-derozan-kyle-lowry-support-raptors-hc-dwane-casey-amid-hot-seat-rumors)  Many other raptors players have said how much they've liked casey and how he's improved as a coach.  As for playoffs series you're right for the most part (though I do remember a fairly easy series against the wizards a second time around when they played in 2018). I honestly didn't mind the fact that they were difficult because they were always exciting and we won against everyone except the cavs in the last 3 years.  And lastly JV did play some fourth quarter minutes. I think most raptors fans remember his missed buzzer beater against the cavs in game 1 2017/2018. And while he did improve his defense while on the raptors and is still improving he did seem to get exposed constantly the playoffs. (see the massive difference in field goal rating). I think this would still be true today despite his improvements.  [https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/](https://www.raptorscage.ca/raptors-projection-2018-19-the-tragic-tale-of-jonas-valanciunas/)  [https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba](https://www.grizzlybearblues.com/2021/4/21/22381808/the-defensively-misunderstood-jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-nba)  Altogether I think while there was shortcomings with Casey that you clearly remember, there is some revisionist history going on by raptors fans to paint him as a largely net negative coach when judging from the players and the record of the team, it isn't at all the case."
Jonas Valanciunas
"He’s not a bust, but I would say he was not the 4th best player in his draft class. Not even the best Center (he was projected as a PF, but moved to Center as the NBA got smaller). I would say there were a couple guys they could have drafted that would have been better in hindsight. Jonas Valanciunas would probably have made more sense, as would Vucevic. Of course, if you’re assuming that there is no way LeBron comes back when you make that pick, but have the hindsight to pick the best player possible, they should have picked Jimmy Butler.  TLDR: Not a bust, but not the best possible pick."
gasol and horford are both too old imo. I think capela and jonas valanciunas are solid options
1. Nikola Jokic 2. Joel Embiid 3. Rudy Gobert 4. Karl Anthony Towns 5. Bam Adebayo 6. Kristaps Porzingis 7. Domantas Sabonis 8. Nikola Vucevic 9. Clint Capela 10. Jusuf Nurkic 11. Myles Turner 12. Christian Wood 13. Jonas Valanciunas 14. Brook Lopez 15. DeAndre Ayton
"That’s not true at all. Look at the Raptors with the Marc Gasol trade:   &gt;“Its not an easy decision, but, to be honest, I think it’s standard. I mean we did our homework, we talked to teams and I think — I don’t remember — there was maybe one scenario where a team offered one.

"Jonas Valanciunas  He came in the league skilled and slender, but was told to put on weight to be able to bang down low. Even though he’s pretty good now I think that him staying closer to his rookie weight and focusing on agility and speed would’ve helped him be more adaptable in today’s NBA"
I tried to fit Jonas Valanciunas in JT before Jason Tatum lmao
Jonas Valanciunas.
"Ilgauskus was 28 &amp; 29 LeBron's first two years, KP was 24 &amp; 25.   KP is better than Ilgauskas but Ilgauskas was a solid player early in LeBron's career. He was an All Star in LeBron's second season and averaged 15 &amp; 8 in LeBron's first 5 seasons. Sadly he was his best teammate in his first Cleveland stint.   Both 7'3 finesse centers that are good shot blockers. Ilgauskas has a better post game, and KP has great 3PT range/volume. I'm sure if Ilgauskas played in todays game he'd be like a mixture of Jonas Valanciunas and KP. Not the low post force JV is but not the extreme range and athleticism that KP has."

I always thought him and lebron were point centers and not forwards/wings. Lebron is basically as big as jonas valanciunas. 6'9 250 lbs vs 6'11 260.
That sounds like Jonas Valanciunas’ music
"Whenever I see his name, I always remember [the time he decided](https://youtu.be/X6YYDDsNreY) to go for a fake high five to steal the ball from Jonas Valanciunas while down 30 with 10 seconds to go."
i'm less concerned about the number of FGA than I am about the quality of those looks.  Yeah some of that is on him but the coaches could be doing much more to get him better looks.     Here is what I meant about how [the Grizzlies scheme Valanciunas open](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2021/5/26/22454618/jonas-valanciunas-memphis-grizzlies-vs-utah-jazz-2021-nba-playoffs).  Notice on many of these touches contact is minimal or non-existent so KP's slender build shouldn't matter.
I've tried telling him that and even said that the whole Warriors team had reduced raw totals to play winning basketball. He insisted that KD is LITERALLY wide open all the time because of his teammates and even in OKC teams were looking to contain Westbrook more.   Oh and btw he also said that Jonas Valanciunas can stop prime Olajuwon because today's players are that much better  Edit: I made a mistake. He actually said Jakob Poeltl can stop Hakeem.
For the raptors we only give rings to the ones on the playoff roster. So we end up not gave a ring to Jonas Valanciunas and Delon Wright. CJ Miles too.
"Death, taxes, and Game 1 Magic.  Honorable mention to Jonas Valanciunas 3s"
I didn't know Jonas Valanciunas coached the Lakers.
"You did not say any of that shit, and that’s the problem. That’s precisely what you want your fucking ball handler to do lmao. Standing in the dunker’s spot and functioning as a roll man like he’s Jonas Valanciunas is pathetic for a guard with his physical gifts.  He’s less than worthless in terms of spacing, is a dogshit free throw shooter, and to top it off he’s not aggressive. That’s inexcusable."

"Poeltl struggles the most against strong Big men with good post moves liken Valanciunas, so that's why you got that impression I assume, because you watched Jonas cook him. But there aren't that many players like that in the league.  Regardless, his impact defensively has been huge all season long, I think it's because he is more nimble than he appears, has good defensive footwork and great timing for blocks, which helps him protect the paint against guards and forwards.  Also Morant gets layups on anybody, I think that has to do more with how ridiculously good he is at that, than Gobert not being that impactful."
He has to be better than Christian Wood and Jonas Valanciunas next season at the very least.
Fuck Jonas Valanciunas go Utah
I often find that people who don't watch the blazers just assume that Nurk is a Jonas Valanciunas/Vucivic clone - big slow center who specializes in post up scoring and is bad at defense - even though that's not close to his actual game at all.
Jonas Valanciunas starting center
"I disagree.  I would happily take Jonas Valanciunas over either of them and Dillon Brooks is at least comparable to Lonzo.  Also, the Pelicans have Bledsoe which is an omegalul."

They can't with Jonas Valanciunas on the floor. You'll notice he's on the bench right now
Is that Kareem Abdul Olajuwon or Jonas Valanciunas
"Even if he doesnt play at that high of a level I still think he will have better career than many. Having Jonas Valanciunas on steroids career is no shame it will pick you up some all star spots, one or two all nba teams(if some of the star centers have off year but i dont think he will be better than Embiid /Jokic). That will mean he would be top 5 center in era(if big boys keep ballin) of Jokic, Joel, Bam, Rudy, Vucevic(maybe exiting his prime) and Robin Lopez. Like in 80s and 90s you had Ewing, Hakeem, Admiral, Shaq and then you had Dikembe with 3 all nba teams, Zo with 2, Parish 2 and so on and Idk but I think all of them are hall of fame. Position is stacked"
"Jonas Valanciunas is an exception, he’s usually referred to as JV. If they call him one name it’s Valanciunas, I’ve never really heard someone just refer to him as “Jonas”."
"&gt;the best 3rd string Center in... NBA history  Just two years ago, Toronto had Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas, Greg Monroe, Chris Boucher, and Marc Gasol at various points in the same season.  They often had three of them and sometimes played 3 in a game.  3-time MVP Moses Malone was briefly the 3rd-string center for the Buffalo Braves, so he'd be the best ever, by a considerable margin.  As soon as Buffalo traded him, he started posting 14/13 for Houston ( and he had already put up a 19/15 full season two years earlier in the ABA, at 19 years old )."
"THJ is a super solid player, one of those guys when I watch his games I notice that he tends to do the right things consistently and make good shots when it matters. He and Jonas Valanciunas are two players that come to mind that aren’t stars, but very consistent role players that any team would want. They can take over games, put up good numbers, and do the little things."

The 2021 Grizz are unironically led by 29 year old Jonas Valanciunas. Ja might be the leader but they suffer the most without Big V
Either this going to be a Jonas (Chucks's voice) Valanciunas or Mike Conley Jr game.

"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors’ execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip…](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6’9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV’s threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday’s game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that’s always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the “Curry experience”](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph’s 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don’t have Draymond’s help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV’s gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can’t switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ———————————————————————   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven’t mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray’s drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant’s shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an “so wide open its practice” 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond’s drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn’t make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn’t capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
Jonas Valanciunas
"That would be a nice fit. I was thinking Jonas Valanciunas for similar reasons.   I feel like Sabonis was at his best when Indy was running their offense through him similar to how Denver was with Jokic. Obviously he wouldn't play that role in GS. It would still be a great fit, but he'd have to sort of accept a Bosh type adjustment."

Dantley is definitely the worst of the three, because he was so close to winning it all the year before they traded him, then the Pistons trade him midseason and they go on to win two in a row."

Fuck Jonas Valanciunas
"I 100% agree   Building a team is super hard   This thing I just did tho, that’s a playoff team, a damn good one.   You cannot do that with Ingram, he’s not good enough.   Replace Warren with Ingram, and Ben with Jonas valanciunas, Serge with a defensive guy like Marcus Smart   That team doesn’t make the playoffs   It’s much easier to build a playoff level team around a great defender   It’s easier to build a championship level team around a great scorer.   Ingram isn’t good enough to be the #1 guy on a playoff team.   Simmons doesn’t have to be that."
"Agreed. As a raptors fan, we got Jonas valanciunas to shoot threes by giving the green light when he’s wide open and fully balanced. He went from 0.0 3pa to 1.0 3pa and it allowed him to develop a pump fake that probably got him one or two free buckets and helped spacing for his teammates. There is no reason why Simmons can’t follow the same protocol to at least build confidence. He only needs to hit a few and not at a good clip either for people to have to play closer to him and it would help spacing and improve the team as a whole. Obviously there is a lot more nuance to that but if JV could, there is no excuse for ben. (Also I know JV is a good ft shooter which helps 3’s but lonzo ball could hit threes early in his career without being a good ft shooter so I don’t see why Ben can’t. We are literally asking for low 30% from 3)"

Was definitely a skilled player but he did come to the NBA late and didn't play many games. I'd say Jonas Valanciunas is better due to longevity and good stats. Dude is a PER beast
"Dwight Howard, Al Horford, DeAndre Jordan were at one time All-NBA centers that are still kinda in the league, its just that ""pure"" big men just don't cut it anymore in the modern NBA.  Jonas Valanciunas, Steven Adams, Richaun Holmes kinda fit the bill, but aren't as dominant as the first group in their primes."
"Yep. Led the league with 6.9 contested rebounds per game, 1.2 over #2 (Jonas Valanciunas). Giannis averaged 3.1 per game - he got lots of rebounds, but not by battling for them in nearly the same way."
"We both know you will stop replying when I do but here it goes.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.raptorshq.com/platform/amp/2019/11/17/20969760/report-toronto-raptors-2019-championship-ring-jonas-valanciunas  Jonas valanciunas did a fuck ton more than boogey did  Raptors GM at the time said this  ““Its not an easy decision, but, to be honest, I think it’s standard. I mean we did our homework, we talked to teams and I think — I don’t remember — there was maybe one scenario where a team offered one. I think it was Anderson Varejao in Golden State but I think it was a really unique circumstance.””"
"Conley for 2 firsts, Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder, and a traded player exception.  Marc Gasol for Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles."
"The double double constant, Jonas Valanciunas, baby."
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
I took a piss next to Jonas Valanciunas at a hotel downtown Toronto a few years back
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
Remember when you thought Jonas Valanciunas did more for the Raptors than DeMar?
To be fair Memphis has had the bad habit of making our guys' nicknames basically just their initials for a while. TA -Tony Allen Zbo - Zach Randolph DB - Dillon Brooks JJJ - Jaren Jackson Jr JV - Jonas Valanciunas  etc etc etc
"Brandon Ingram 43.2% catch and shoot 3's     Devonte Graham 42.3% catch and shoot 3's     Trey Murphy 50-40-90 in college, (56, 44, 100 in the the SL)     Jonas Valanciunas 36% from 3, 55% 16ft - 3, 50% 10-16ft, 17ppg on 63 TS%"
Jonas Valanciunas
"This is basically their depth chart now right?  Devonte' Graham / Tomas Satoransky / Kira Lewis  Nickeil Alexander-Walker / Josh Hart  Brandon Ingram / Garrett Temple / Trey Murphy  Zion Williamson / Wenyen Gabriel  Jonas Valanciunas / Jaxson Hayes / Willy Hernangómez  They could be a play in team but their defense is probably going to be terrible again this next year and their bench is not good. They'll need to have like a top 3 offense to be a decent team.  Considering they have a dude averaging 27 PPG on great efficiency making 10M/year, probably being a below average team in their conference is pretty bad imo."
"&gt; He played 38 mins a game that playoffs.  It was a wrist injury lol. That doesn't affect your cardio or ability to move.  &gt; You keep mentioning how Wall was better than Lowry  Of course he was. Because of the injury.  &gt; Oh no let’s do like you though and minimize it to just “1 ppg and 3 apg” as if any real objective basketball fan would use an argument so basic. Hey Our New PG Dennis Schröder only averaged 2 ppg and 3 apg less than Lowry last season guess there isn’t a huge jump in how good they are compared to each other lol.  You're the one minimizing it to just two stats. Lowry beats him by every advanced metric and was a significantly better defender. You're completely right that Lowry scoring just 2ppg and 3apg more than Schroeder doesn't show the whole picture, you have to look at *all* of the stats. Was Colin Sexton better than Chris Paul because he averaged more ppg this year? Oh and Jonas Valanciunas is better than Rudy Gobert. And don't forget that Jordan Clarkson is way better than Dejounte Murray.   Or do we need to look at more than just minimal differences in base box stats to evaluate a player?  Honestly at this point I'm not exactly sure if you understand how efficiency works. 1ppg is, quite literally, meaningless without looking at efficiency. But if that's your reason for Wall being better then you do you.  &gt; Wall was better in the regular season  So... Lowry leads him in every advanced stat and had Curry level efficiency and was one of the best floor spacers in the league... but Wall got 1 more ppg so he was way better lmao. Got it.  &gt; Would love to hear what you think Lowry could’ve been if he hadn’t been “hurt” throughout his prime though. Maybe a couple of 1st team all nbas? An MVP? Scoring titles? Surely in contention for goat right?  Lol come on now. Let's just have a mature debate about this without strawmanning. Personally I think Lowry had an argument for one more all nba third team in 2016 though, but it's debatable."

"Metu’s career was almost ended when Jonas Valanciunas had a dangerous foul on him while he was in the air. When some nobody pulls some shit that can end the career of an established player, that established player is going to take it personally. Metu should get suspended for a game and that should be the end of it"
"Jonas Valanciunas. He has probably peaked already, and isn't an All-Star, but he's a solid competitive big man at both ends on a good value contract."
Jonas Valanciunas is pretty underrated. He just doesn’t get as much spotlight with other big men like Embiid/Giannis/Jokic also having breakout season. He averaged 17/13/2 on 60% shooting. If Memphis utilized him more and gave him a few more minutes I could easily see him putting up all star stats

"Deandre Ayton, OG Anunoby, Draymond Green, Malcolm Brogdon, Bojan Bogdanovic, Jonas Valanciunas, Tobias Harris, Gordon Hayward nkt on the list.  I would take out Michael Porter, Collins, Ball, Edwards and replace them with Draymond, Hayward, Harris, Ayton.  But I guess the sentiment is correct and Id have Collins at least top 60"

"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Jonas valanciunas was a monster and won summer league mvp. I wish he became a 5x champion
"And you know what's funny? Haven't we seen a ton of good offensive bigs just suddenly extend their range to the 3 point line halfway through their career? Marc Gasol, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Al Horford, all these dudes started out shooting only last-second heaves but were solid in the midrange, then they stepped back one summer and naturally added a 35% J to their arsenal.  I'm certainly not saying Sengun is going to start making 3+ a game, but it seems like one of those things I'd be less worried about if I were a GM."
&gt;They got Jonas Valanciunas who was the grizzlies best player for most of last season.  Why do people keep saying this shit since we traded him.
"The Pelicans did not get worse. They got Jonas Valanciunas who was the grizzlies best player for most of last season. Devonte Graham is still a solid player. They have much more depth than last year by having Satoransky and Temple and another year for other guys to develop.   It may not be a playoff team yet, but I definitely don't think they got worse. I also LOVE their second round pick Herbert Jones. He has the ability to be an impact defender right away."

"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
"i legit thought about capela when he missed all these layups. if he just had a decent post game, let's say like jonas valanciunas, he would be a top 3 center in the league without a doubt"
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "
"Coaches: Willie Green, Mike D'Antoni  Center: Jonas Valanciunas  FC: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram  BC: Devonte Graham, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  NO Bledsoe, Adams, Lonzo  Still moves to be made too... it's looking a WHOLE lot better than last year  P.S. fuck r/nba"
"yes but i don't see any trades. fine...you didn't want to get a rental of kawhi and harden didn't want to go there.  Aaron Gordon was traded.  vucevic was traded.  jonas valanciunas was traded.  did you try to do a sign and trade for derozen or anyone else?  from the outside, it looks like blazers are afraid to make a move out of fear they'll make the team worse.  blazers have been dame, CJ and nurkic with pieces.  thats good enough to make the playoffs but not much else.  morey would have blown that up 2 years ago.  Riley would have traded CJ for butler or someone else.  you are keeping Dame...thats a given but everyone else should have been on the trade block."
Do you think you've jumped a bunch of teams and will be in the top 6? You think this roster is going to suddenly win 45 games because of Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham?
They got value for a leaving Lonzo and got Jonas Valanciunas while also getting off of 2 ass contracts. I don't see how they lost
"Fair enough. Thanks for looking into it. While I don't agree with some of your reasoning, I can't deny the % stats.  Are you familiar with 2017 European Championship?

I would assume had you seen those, you would be more reluctant to write them off.

In the 70s, a WFL pro football team relocated from ... Toronto, that was called the Northmen, but was nicknamed the Grizzlies. When they came to Memphis they became the Southmen, and kept the Grizzlies name too.  -- Several former NBA Memphis Grizzlies have ended up on the Raptors, including Matt Devlin, Kyle Lowry, and Marc Gasol. In return, former Raptor Jonas Valanciunas became a fan favorite in Memphis. And Memphis rooted strongly for Marc and the Raptors when they won their chip.  So root for both. If Toronto is the North, Memphis is the South."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
"We’re just throwing that word out to anyone right? Lmao. Jonas Valanciunas is a unicorn too i guess.   All I’m saying is - SGA &gt; anyone on the Cavs AND Mobley. 0 logic to rejecting that offer, SGA is highly underrated if y’all think it was right to reject that"
"If Jonas Valanciunas is part of a big three then there are like 50 ""big threes"" in the NBA."
That’s Kyle Lowry’s former teammate Jonas Valanciunas to you sir
"Jonas Valanciunas is a better overall player, on a better salary and could likely be had for that package."
There were definitely some centers in this draft:  1.	Jonas Valanciunas 2.	Tristan Thompson 3.	Enes Kanter 4.	Nikola Vucevic
He's the Milwaukee Bucks Demar DeRozan &amp; Jonas Valanciunas
That’s like the best possible individual season one can have. So somewhere in between Carmelo Anthony and Jonas Valanciunas imo.
"Nope, those cash considerations got used up paying Jrue's championship bonus and putting the Bucks over the luxury tax.  (/s, I have no clue if they'll give him one.  You'd think so given how often teams do it, but then again, the Raptors didn't even give Jonas Valanciunas a ring after everything he did for them, so who knows.)"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porziņģis / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Dončić / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schröder / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
"If win shares and Vorp and shit actually accurately reflected reality, Gobert would be the 2nd best player in the world, Cp3, Capela, and Mikal would be top 15.  /#16 in WS last year was Jonas Valanciunas   /#17 was Luka  /#18 was Enes Kanter  /#21 was Montrezl  /#28 Zubac  /#42 Poeltl, 43 Kyle Anderson, 44 LeBron.   Lol"
"He increased his fga from year 1 to yr 2 from 15 to 17 and gained 4.5 more ppg on only 2 more fga while simultaneously  increasing his fg eff by 2.7% and his ft eff by 5.8. He didn't start running the point until almost 1/3 of the season and even then Pels players still bricked shots at an alarmingly high rate.   Devonte Graham  hit 38% of his 3s last year which is good but taking into account that 71% of his 12.2 fga were 3s he is a huge add for Pels spacing. Trey  Murphy is one of two players in college to shoot 50/40/90. In summer league he 16.3/7/2.8 on 54/44/100 and was named all summer league. Jonas Valanciunas is a huge upgrade and underrated pick up at Center he avg 17.1 and 12.5 on 59% last season. [Here](https://twitter.com/cclark3000/status/1419809641492619264?s=19) is the comparison of his range of scoring vs Steven's last year. Anyone who watched the Pels can tell you 6'6 Nickiel Alexander Walker is a huge upgrade over 6'1 Eric ""I wasn't paying attention"" Bledsoe.  Not only is it completely fathomable that Zion can hit the numbers I'm predicting, but he could do it on under 21 fga."
They put Beal at 11 and CJ McCollum over Zach Lavine and Jonas Valanciunas in the 90s. The list does not make sense
I haven’t heard that but do agree. I love 90s bball and grew up watching it. People romanticize it though. Athletes always improve with time. Especially the “it was more physical then” talk track. If anything that’s a huge advantage to bigger faster stronger players…  Enes Kanter and Jonas valanciunas would probably average 25 and 20 in the 90s lol
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait is JV Jonas Valanciunas? Retire his number?
"Starters:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Jonas Valanciunas    for my 2nd unit, I decided to only use 2 non bench players to make this a tad bit more challenging  6th: Lonzo Ball  7th: Jordan Clarkson  8th: Myles Turner  9th: Joe Ingles  10th: Montrezl Harrell   Reserves:  Mathisse Thybulle  Doug McDermott"
"Hardest part of this mental exercise is how we define a superstar. I'll try and avoid borderline top 10 players like Beal, George, Tatum etc.  PG: Jrue Holiday (Premier perimeter defense) SG: Duncan Robinson (Historic 3 pt shooting) SF: Kevin Durant (Kevin Durant) PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (A Greek freek) C: Rudy Gobert (DPOY)  Bench: Lonzo Ball (discount Jrue), Joe Ingles (3&amp;D+ bench playmaking), OG Anunoby (versatile 3&amp;D) and Jonas Valanciunas (monster rim runner/ rebounder)"
"Superstars: KD &amp; Curry All-stars: Dame &amp; Zion Role players: Tobias Harris, Jamaal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas, Myles Turner, Deandre Ayton, Joe ingles, P.J. Tucker, Ja morant (who I consider a star but technically isn’t an all star yet)"
Jonas Valanciunas up
"Uh finally some discussion about the basketball part of the tweet.          I agree with Marcus that you can improve your defense by those things but also there are a lot of people that can do all those and still be bad/below average at defense.         A lot of players just don’t have the size or lateral quickness to become great defenders, despite all the effort. Jonas Valanciunas is one of those players. He plays with a lot of effort but he just can't move his feet fast enough to not get burned on defense."
"We like our bigs shooting about one three a game, yeah.  For the 2020-21 season:  Jonas Valanciunas: 0.9 three attempts a game at 36.8%  Xavier Tillman: 1.1 threes at 33.8%  Brandon Clarke: 1.3 threes at 26% (something happened to his shooting form, he was fine at 36% his rookie year on 1.1 attempts)  Then Jaren has the ultra green light."
Ja played worse with Valanciunas on the court. He was much better in games Jonas sat out because Valanciunas clogs the paint and Ja’s not a shooter. Not having JJJ hurt Ja so much.
"Dragan Bender, Mario Hezonja, Dante Exum, Dario Saric, Enes Kanter, Jonas Valanciunas, Jan Vesely, Ricky Rubio.  It's not that hard to understand. The hit rate on the top international guys leading up to Doncic was very poor, and Luka had worse physical tools than most of them. Ricky Rubio was billed as a can't miss guy in a similar vein to Luka, and then he missed."
"Someone in the universe thinks Jonas Valanciunas is, or will be overpriced?"
Jonas Valanciunas
Steven Adams   PJ Tucker   Jusuf Nurkic   Morris twins   Marcus Smart   Jimmy Butler   Jonas Valanciunas
Demar Derozan earned a 2nd team all-nba in 2017-18 with a line of 23/3.9/5.2 on exactly league average TS.  Your first instinct might be ok those are not great numbers for a 2nd team considering his awful defense. And you would be right.   You might then think but wait they won 59 games so even though Zach Lavine has put up almost identical numbers (2019-20) and NOT EVEN MADE ALL-STAR much less All-NBA that hw must have been indispensable on the court.   Wrong again. Demar had a negative on/off even this season and the NBA roster featured a whopping 10 PLAYERS who are significant rotation players even now 4 years later.  Here is the list:  OG Anunoby Demar Derozan Serge Ibaka Kyle Lowry Jakob Poeltl Norman Powell Pascal Siakam Jonas Valanciunas  Fred Vanvleet Delon Wright  Of course this team was one of the best in the NBA with a 10 man rotation like that!
So I've a friend that's such a hater for 90's basketball that he said that Jonas Valanciunas can stop Hakeem because the players now are so much better in every way. No joke.   It supports his Lebron James&gt;&gt;&gt; Jordan argument because Lebron played against superior competition.
"If the Pelicans only got rid of Eric Bledsoe they'd win this easily. They also made a much needed upgrade at center with Jonas Valanciunas over Steven Adams. Have 6 different young players who will show growth in Zion, BI, Jaxson Hayes, NAW, Kira, and Naji Marshall and drafted players who can play d and showed out in summer league Trey Murphy (all summer league) and Herb Jones. Also Murphy looks like a sniper which is much needed."
*Jonas Valanciunas led the team to their first playoff berth &amp; winning season
"That literally was not your exact point. In fact, you said JV was better from that range. [Since you love posting that link, take a look at this one.](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jonas-valanciunas-shot-chart) Oops, looks like JV actually shoots worse from free throw range. You didn't even check to see if you were right, you just checked to see if others were wrong."
So...basically Jonas Valanciunas.
"You're saying ""Griffin got played"" about an awesome trade that has overjoyed every Pelicans fan. The Pels dumped both Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams for Jonas Valanciunas, who is better than either and cheaper than both. The Pels also traded down in the draft – but ended up picking a guy at 17 (Trey Murphy) who should have gone in the top five.  So, in other words, of the three established players and two rookies exchanged in that trade, the Pelicans got the best player (Valanciunas) and also the best rookie (Murphy) – both on cheaper contracts.  If that's ""getting played,"" sign me up for more."
they also got the best player back in that trade in Jonas Valanciunas
I'll try to use non-superstar examples  PG - Ricky Rubio  SG - CJ McCollum  SF - Khris Middleton  PF - Paul Millsap  C - Jonas Valanciunas
"PG/Ball handler: Gets everyone involved, can score when needed, dictates the pace of the offense. Someone like Jose Calderon.  SG/SF/Wing: Interchangeable roles. You want one to be a shot creater, someone who can get a bucket when the shot clock is running down but also a willing passer. Someone like Tracy McGrady. The other one should be a good off the ball player who can cut and catch and shoot, but also attack of swings and is usually a good defender. Someone like Morris Peterson.  Power Forward: For today's game, someone that can space out to the three, but also screen and pop/roll and bang a bit a down low and even play some small ball 5 minutes. Chris Bosh works here.  Centre: A big body who can grab rebounds and protect the rim. Someone who can shoot from outside the paint but also someone you can dump it down to in the post when you need a bucket and can take advantage if a team tries to go small. Jonas Valanciunas comes to mind here."
"&gt; 15 PPG could be good for a 3rd option, if they are scored efficiently.  During the playoffs the third options for the final 4 (and Spurs) in 2016 were  Raptors -  Jonas Valanciunas 13.8 PPG on 57/0/74  Thunder - Serge Ibaka 12 PPG on 52/45/75  Cavs - Kevin Love 14.7 PPG on 39/41/84  Spurs - Tony Parker 10.4 PPG on 45/25/86  Warriors - Draymond Green 15.4 PPG on 43/37/74 (highest scoring third option)  So Love was from the top 5 worst from 2, 2nd best from 3, and 2nd best from the line. He also shot more 3s than even Green though, 5.6 to 4.5"
"""Muscular Jerry Stackhouse"", ""Monta Ellis could do what Russ did if he had the same green light"", ""Jonas Valanciunas did more for the Raptors than DeMar"".   Got any other dumbass takes you want to make."
There’s extra factors but one time Caron Butler pretended to dap up Jonas valanciunas while the clock was about to run out and then he stole the ball off him and tried to go for a fast break dunk. He was obviously fouled hard from behind and the Air Canada Center showered him with boos
"For the vast majority of the Toronto fanbase it would have to be Kyle Lowry.  Many would say Derozan (not me though - to me he's a reminder of teams that were just not good enough and had constant failures in the playoffs).  Personally, it's Jonas Valanciunas."

"&gt;Meyers Leonard for example is fucking huge and jacked and so are a lot of white players. Never heard them called “physical specimens,” more often “gym rats” or whatever. I agree that most amazing athletes in American sports are Black, but I don’t see how that relates to my point. The “physical specimen” language simply doesn’t get used as often on players like Meyers Leonard, Alex Caruso, Jonas Valanciunas, or JJ Watt in football, despite its arguably equal applicability.  The thing is, nobody cares about Myers Leonard. That's the honest truth. Tons of people talk about Caruso's hops, but he isn't really jacked like Giannis or as quick as Fox. Again, people just don't care about Jonas that much."

There are enough white players that take bad shots such that the lack of “low-BBIQ” white players is more than just a reflection of their lack of representation in the league. This one is a little entangled with the perception of all white players as shooters, admittedly, but I do still believe there’s something to be said for the difference in perception here between a white player and a black player with otherwise similar stats."

"&gt;  JV is a better defender than Myles Turner and cheaper too.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  Myles Turner who got DPOY votes?  Myles Turner who was the early season favorite to win DPOY until Rudy did Rudy things?  That Myles Turner?  Turner is a much, much better defender than Jonas Valanciunas.  JV is an okay rim defender but doesn't have the mobility to get by/through one screen, and his closing speed on recovery is measured in epochs.  Myles Turner is so good he hides Sabonis's poor defense.  What in the world made you think JV was a good defender?  The man is a career negative defensive box +/-, and was -.4 for you last season.  He was replaced by the ghost of Marc Gasol and his former team won a chip.  &gt;  Number three. Lonzo didn’t fit here. You don’t shell out that kind of money and tie up your last offseason of cap space for a player who unequivocally doesn’t fit. And don’t give me the highlights or the percentages. Outside of catch-and-shoot 3s, Lonzo’s atrocious beyond the arc.  Very few players can shoot well off the dribble.  He shot .378 on 8.3 shots a game.  It genuinely doesn't matter if you don't like what kind of 3's he was taking, he provided excellent spacing and some decent scoring.  He improved every year you had him.  He was an excellent playmaker, defender, and good shooter.  This all despite the awkward and shitty backcourt he was saddled with when Bledsoe got there.  Not that I think Bledsoe was bad, but he was definitely a bad fit.  If a player improves every year you have him, and finds a way to be a positive player on a 43% win rate team, you give him money."
"Jonas valanciunas for me.  They made him bulk up to play as a traditional center, then the meta changed.  Also coach casey would always pull him from the game when he was getting hot.  I always wondered how jv would turn out if nurse was his coach from day 1"

Jonas Valanciunas is yet to play his return game in Toronto.
"Jonas valanciunas is not even close to top 3 most efficient scoring centers (embiid, KAT, jokic) come on now"
"I’m down for the Pelicans spot  This off-season was definitely a doozy. While we made some good moves, you have to take into account that David Griffin was fixing some of the mistakes he made last season. We traded away Steven Adams and Eric “The Actual Devil” Bledsoe, thus freeing up a ton of cap space. While we couldn’t land a big free agent like Lowry or CP3, the Pelicans took their shot at it, and I can’t fault them for trying.  While the Pelicans caught, and are still catching, a lot of flak for letting Lonzo go, it was the right move. Paying Lonzo $21 million a year when we couldn’t even make the play-in last year with a mostly healthy team was not the move.   We added a few good pieces in Jonas Valanciunas and Devonte Graham, who will definitely make the Pelicans a better team.  The Pelicans this year are focusing on internal growth. Specifically Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up to be that 3rd scoring option, and Brandon Ingram making moves on defense. We’re also counting on rookie Trey Murphy III to lend us some spacing.  The biggest move of all was hiring new head coach Willie Green. The players love him and he seems like a huge upgrade over SVG.  All in all, the Pelicans are not worse than we were last year. If we’re better or if we made lateral moves remains to be seen. If Zion can come back healthy, and the guys we drafted take a step up, we will be fighting for a playoff spot."
"The contract dictates how the 150 is divided per year. It likely will not be equally per year. For example, Jonas Valanciunas signed a 3 year 45 mill deal, but it wasnt 15 per year. It was like 17, 15, 13 or something like that, a declining deal which is not all that common. But what is common is that each year is different from the other years in amount.  So after you find out what each year pays, then I believe the team pays the player via direct deposit every 2 weeks from the opening of the training camp until end of regular season (or maybe its the end of the finals). So, if its a 40 week season (i dont know how long the season technically is) divide the salary by 20 (every 2 weeks in a 40 wk period). Perhaps there are special provisions contracts can include to reduce each of those checks but spread them over 52 weeks, but I dont think there is.   Teams provide free meals prepped by their cooks not billed to the player. Teams arent like extortionist music labels, fronting costs and expecting musicians to pay them back all those costs before beginning giving them their miniscule percentages of each record sale.   NBA teams know that there is no salary cap on nonplayer salaries and expenses. So that is an opportunity to enhance their support of players. So they can hire more coaches per player, pay those coaches more, hire more medical staff, buy more equipment, etc, etc, etc.  During the pandemic, some teams sent players entire workout systems to their homes, not billed to the player, and I dont think considered part of compensation that counts against the cap.  I dont know where else teams would stay on the road except for hotels. They arent staying in 10 buck hostels.  But when it comes to home, occasionally (usually during playoffs) teams will stay at a hotel at home to keep their players away from distractions and in a business mindset. Doesnt happen often, I dont think."
He’s not even better than Capela or Gobert. He’s a more mobile Jonas Valanciunas lol but without any jumpshot

"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"The Pelicans could run out two intriguing units:  SPEED: Kira Lewis/Devonte' Graham/Nickeil Alexander-Walker/Ingram/Zion  JUMBO: Ingram/Trey Murphy/Zion/Jaxson Hayes/Jonas Valanciunas  Each of those units are plausible 1–2–3–4–5, at least in short bursts. Neither would be used for long, if at all.  But they would be fun to see. The first could run circles around you, and the second could run you over."
The Raptors didn’t give Jonas valanciunas a ring even though he contributed a lot during the season so I doubt Sixers give Simmons ring if he doesn’t contribute especially since he is choosing to sit out
For some reason I have a very easy time remembering he's on the Grizzlies but it feels very strange that Jonas Valanciunas is on the Pelicans.
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;Jonas Valanciunas  fuck him
*That man was Jonas Valanciunas so it’s clearly OBVIOUS you have no idea what the hell I am talking about 😂😭
Jonas Valanciunas and Travis Kelce  Trae Young and Tessio from The Godfather
"People attribute too much of the Grizzlies' success to Ja IMO. Yeah, he's an exciting young PG, but I'd argue *Jonas Valanciunas* was their best player the last two years (he's comically underrated, too, I saw people acting like trading him for Adams was a lateral move when it *really, really wasn't*)."
Jonas? As in Valanciunas? His team is on pace to win 22 games this year. There's absolutely no way that he should make the team.
luckily mah boi Jonas Valanciunas has been keeping me afloat
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5. Bobby Portis - 44.4% (72 total attempts) 6. Norm Powell - 44.4% (81 total attempts) 7. Lonzo Ball - 44.4% (151 total attempts) 8. KAT - 44% (125 total attempts) 9. Doug McDermott - 43.9% (57 attempts) 10. Nic Batum - 43.8% (73 attempts)  From u/Mdgt_Pope
"Jonas ""The Furry Curry"" Valanciunas"
"And out of the top 10, Jonas Valanciunas has the second least total attempts. Patty Mills has attempted over twice as many more attempts than him and still hold second in 3P%.   Sample size, baby."
Agreed but Jonas Valanciunas &gt; a mid to late 20s pick
"Right?  Firstly, that Lakers pick is being highly underrated. Picks in the teens aren't exactly a sure thing, but that could be a quality role player, there's an outside chance they draft a star, or it can be packaged for a known quantity in a trade.  Secondly, this Memphis team will go as far as Ja and JJJ take them, and 29 year old Jonas Valanciunas is not a guy they're going to build around for the next decade. He's a great player, and he's balling in NOLA, but that team sucks ass, it's basically Jonas/Ingram carrying a bunch of mediocre vets (sorry Sato, Temple and Graham) and below average backups. There's a reason they're 6-17.  Having a low-usage, rebounding big man is perfect for Memphis. Getting a future first as well is just neat."
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5.

Doug McDermott - 43.9% (57 attempts) 10. Nic Batum - 43.8% (73 attempts)  Only person who's shot less than Valanciunas is McDermott.

Jonas Valanciunas. Awesome dude and consistently underrated player
"Jaxson Hayes yelled, “There he goes!” Jonas Valanciunas gave a look of horrified surprise. Brandon Ingram belted, “We got a fucking unit now.” And before Zion Williamson got stuck trying to enter the locker room door, ex-NBA player, now coach, Willie Green hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so fat.”"
"I would've liked to Valanciunas win with us, but I'm not gonna say ""I wish it was Jonas instead Gasol"" after Gasol gave us his all. It just sounds disrespectful."

"I’ve watched a lot of Wolves games this year, honestly because they’ve been really entertaining. I do not think KAT plays soft. KAT, at least from what I’ve seen, is a very emotional player. Ant and him will be on the floor showing tons of intensity and drive to make big plays. The flip side of that is the first Pelicans game when he let a few bad calls and Jonas Valanciunas get him pissed off and throw him off for the second half of the game.   Regardless KAT is one of the best bigs in the game. Really fun player to watch."
"This take only exists if you didn't watch the Grizzlies play last regular season. Jonas Valanciunas was the Grizzlies best regular season player, Kyle Anderson wasn't far off Ja either. Ja dealt with injuries and was very meh most of the season with highlight plays that just got pushed hard on social media.   19ppg on 53.7% TS with 7.4ast/3.2to while playing terrible defense is not noteworthy unless you have a massive narrative behind you."

They traded vaunted defensive stalwart Jonas Valanciunas for defensive liability Steven Adams
"Valanciunas is a big loss for them honestly. Idk if this tells the whole story, but part of it has to be that he had a 31% DRB% last year, and this year Adams has only a 20%. Adams grabs more offensive rebounds than Jonas, but if I had to guess, the Grizz are giving up tons of O-Rebs of their own."
We were disgusting with Jonas Valanciunas coming off the bench for us. Yet we still traded him and some bench depth for Marc Gasol to become even more disgusting and have Ibaka come off the bench. When you have a window you make the most of it that you can

"I thought this thread was gonna be about taking a player from a bad  situation to another team, like say moving KAT out of Minnesota, but I see you're more talking about playing time.  I don't have a name to put forward here, but I just wanna say, us Raptors fans were in this situation in the latter years of the Dwane Casey/DeRozan/Lowry Raptors with Jonas Valanciunas. It became a meme that Valanciunas must have had sex with Dwane Casey's wife, because Casey hates him and wasn't playing him enough.   It's not like he was buried in the bench or anything, he always averaged at least 22 MPG, but we did see his average go from a high of 28.2 in his sophomore season to 22.4 MPG in Casey's last year (2017/2018).   So it was good to see us belatedly validated by seeing Jonas have a career season in Memphis last year, playing a career high 28.3 MPG, and putting up even higher numbers this year on the Pelicans on 33.5 MPG."
Not really an enforcer or anything but Jonas Valanciunas is not someone you want to fuck with
"Jonas Valanciunas at $14m would make us heavy favorites this year.  Love me some Looney but he's not half the player Jonas is and he's looking even slower than last season. Guards are just blowing by him, which used to be his main skill.  Wiseman is a huge question mark and might not be able to contribute this year.  Our biggest weakness in the playoffs is that we'd have no one to match with Jokic/AD/Ayton/Embiid etc. Looney isn't bringing much offensively, and he can't really guard those guys, hell even Adams and Jonas ate his lunch. Jonas can't stop those guys either but at least he can battle for boards and score on the other end.  The good news is we can wait until the trade deadline to get a feel for where the team and the rookies are holding before doing anything rash.  Could also target Wood for the same price, but I'd be less interested."

Jonas Valanciunas
"On March 30, 2019, the Suns were home against a short-handed Memphis Grizzlies team. Center Richaun Holmes was out due to a migraine and Ayton had rolled his ankle late in the third quarter. In their absence, Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas dominated, scoring 14 of his 34 points in a decisive fourth quarter for a 120-115 Memphis win. The loss dropped the Suns to 17-60. The NBA on ESPN and the ESPN app  Immediately after the game, according to staffers, Sarver marched into the coaches locker room and unloaded, berating head coach Igor Kokoskov and his assistants, demanding answers as to why they didn't ""make any adjustments"" to stop the burly Grizzlies center.  Veteran assistant Joe Prunty, who did not respond to a request for comment, spoke up, saying the short-handed Suns had made several in-game adjustments -- fronting Valanciunas, doubling him on the catch, explaining other basketball minutiae.  ""Joe starts throwing all the s--- at him, [and] the guy has no idea what any of that means,"" said one former coach, details that others in the room confirmed. Sarver, livid, marched toward the door and screamed ""No adjustments!"" on his way out. ----  Holy fuck, the idiocy."
