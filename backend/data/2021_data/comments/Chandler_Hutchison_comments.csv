"Half of them are on the Bulls, Chandler Hutchison and Thomas Satoransky."
"Otto Porter Jr., Lauri Markkanen and Chandler Hutchison for the Bulls."
chandler hutchison you can do it
we traded daniel gafford and chandler hutchison for mo wagner then immediately flipped wagner+luke kornet for theis
Chandler Hutchison and Shaquille Harrison. Even NBA database has mistaken their measurements...
"Wizards-Bulls-Celtics trade:  Wizards give up Moe Wagner and Troy Brown Jr. to get Daniel Gafford and Chandler Hutchison  Celtics give up Daniel Theis and Javonte Green for Moe Wagner and Luke Kornet  Bulls give up Daniel Gafford, Chandler Hutchison, and Luke Kornet for Troy Brown Jr., Daniel Theis, and Javonte Green"
Chandler Hutchison
"Truth be told, we can talk about Brooks (he's bad), Russ (he's been bad this playoffs), but we are in 2021 and one team is in the playoffs with Rui Hachimura and Chandler Hutchison as the only players between 6'3 and 6'8 in their rotation, not sure what you can expect with that, especially because it's not like those 2 are any good either"
Is Chandler Hutchison out? I remember him playing okay in the play-in games
"When your rotation includes Alex Len and Raul Neto, your best wing defender is chandler hutchison, and you often run three guard lineups versus the biggest team in the league, you’re probably gonna lose every game"
"Yeah iirc it was Gafford and Chandler Hutchison to the Wizards, javonte green and theis and Troy brown to the bulls, moe Wagner and Luke kornet to the Celtics"
No that’s not Rui that’s Chandler Hutchison. Marv only knows like 6 names
Hutchinson does not exist. Chandler Hutchison however...
Words never said before in the history of the NBA: We need more Chandler Hutchison (and fewer 3-guard lineup minutes).
chandler hutchison
Chandler Hutchison
"It's not confirmed but Chandler Hutchison got into a spat with Billy Donovan over his lack of playing time, which led to Hutch being away from the team with Donovan saying he ""needed to work on some things"". Speculation is he asked to be traded if they weren't going to play him, so I'm going with Chandler Hutchison"

"""no guys srsly they're adding like 4 more teams! biggest trade ever!""  *chandler hutchison gets traded*"
If your team is relying on Chandler Hutchison to be a difference maker at all that means your team is in a really bad spot. He's super replaceable.
"My probably incorrect guess:  It's added on as part of the Russell Westbrook trade as a three team deal. The Nets want to be compensated a player, but they can't take on a player without paying a ton in luxury tax payments, so they want to dump Jordan. Meanwhile, the Wizards have a logjam at forward/center now, so they probably want to consolidate some of those players or trade them for better positional fits, so they're rerouting some of the players from the Lakers trade to yet another team. The Wizards have also been rumored to be interested in dumping Chandler Hutchison with a second or two since they'll be near or potentially above the luxury tax depending on what happens with the other trades, so that brings in one more team.  If it's not that then I'm also quite curious  Edit: totally forgot about the Pacers Wizards draft night trade, so there’s another team. Apparently the lakers are still trying to S&amp;T Schroder, so that could be another?"
"It's worth noting that he is currently an assistant at Boise State, where he was credited with the development of players like Chandler Hutchison. He also coached in the G-League for a bit and works with college and NBA players in the off-season.   Obviously, the connection to Dame plays a role, but he's not some random scrub coach at Weber State."
Chandler Hutchison truly is just another man's trash
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."

"Sweet, some of us were always irrationally high on Chandler Hutchison"
"Any player is good compared to us obviously, when we say someone isn’t good we mean relatively speaking. Chandler Hutchison sucks relative to his peers he is competing for a roster spot with."
"Chandler Hutchison getting traded, then helping his team make the playoffs, was one of the feel good stories of last NBA season."
"Just so people get a full picture of what OP is getting at, they believe that the above describes Chandler Hutchison and that he is a productive NBA player"
Phoenix is now 1-3 since acquiring Chandler Hutchison
Chandler Hutchison - He had enough salt to season 10 steaks after being traded from the bulls wtf
"Might end up being a win-win trade.   But getting multiple good players for a team with no depth is a win. Especially considering Dinwiddie fills most of the void left by Westbrook.    Essentially went from .. Westbrook, Garrison Matthews, Chandler Hutchison, Robin Lopez =&gt; Spencer Dinwiddie, KCP, Kuzma, Harrell"
