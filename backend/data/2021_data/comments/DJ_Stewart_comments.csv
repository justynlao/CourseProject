"DeAndre is washed, but rebounding is a pure team effort. Like last year we were the 2nd best rebounding team in the league because everyone gave a lot of effort in that field (plus we had Allen). But this year a lot of dudes will kinda half heartedly box out, and only do it when the game actually starts to matter. Like Stewart got so many o-rebounds this game where he was the 1 guy in between like 3 Nets just watching him. I blame DJ 100% when he barely tries on switches, but I'm not gonna blame him when he plays help defense and no one comes to box out his man and clean up the glass.  Also on a side note why KD is so key for our team (beyond being obviously really good at basketball. Harden is the engine of the offense but KD helps fill our two biggest holes, defense and rebounding. He's not a great rebounder for his size, but he's still a 7 footer who tries, and his defensive switch-ability is key for our schemes."
Lmaoooo okay well if Stewart isnâ€™t ready to fight the whole team why the fuck does he think he can fight lebron? And itâ€™s funny you say been pampered since high school like that has any relevance in the fact that Stewart didnâ€™t do shit. And lebron ainâ€™t some small dude so idk why you highlight DJ size and not lebrons.
"Without DJ on the court conducting an ocular patdown, how is LeBron supposed to focus on basketball knowing that any time Isaiah Stewart might come rushing in to attack him?"
I think when he went back he was yelling at DJ. The angles just show Stewart but when they briefly show his over the shoulder heâ€™s kind of directed at DJ. So Iâ€™m curious if he provoked him further lol. Could be flat out wrong though
"Stewart got himself and Bron suspended with all that fake aggression. Man looked Bron in the face for like 8 seconds did nothing, then acted like he was the hulk when people got in between them. His hulk powers also conveniently went away when he got close to DJ."
"S/O DJ and Russ, clown shit by Stewart"
DJ wanted all that   Stewart gets another 2-3 steps and this whole thing goes up like a tinderbox
"He did tho. He just got hold the most, he was the most aggressive to come at Stewart.  DJ and russ were putting their body infront thats true but AD is the one whos trying to reach him, but he got held by the lakers staff pretty bad."
stewart deserved it. the way he was using dj as leverage to dig his entire body weight through his elbow into lebron's arm pit woulda had me heated too
Lol at Westbrook all brave with AD and DJ body guarding LeBron from Stewart a literal tank. If all hell kicked off Westbrook would get swatted away like a kitten between a pack of angry rottweilers. ðŸ˜‚
I mean dude was face to face with Lebron and didn't do anything until people held him back. Then literally broke free of everyone and stopped in front of DJ and Russ.   This was more than what we usually see but let's not act like Stewart wasn't doing the hold me back shit either
NGL that Stewart vs DJ matchup potential is a better fight then the recent big boxing matches (fury Wilder 3 NOT one of them)
"The moment he saw DJ is the moment he got caught.  PS - Stewart didn't deserve that at all, just playing hard"
