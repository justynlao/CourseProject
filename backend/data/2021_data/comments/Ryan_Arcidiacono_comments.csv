Ryan “The Arch of Dimes” Arcidiacono.
"He's not playing team ball and has a terrible bball IQ. Got out played by his backup, Ryan Arcidiacono, which is all that needs to be said."
"But if you lower the minutes floor to 25, you see that he's no match for Ryan Arcidiacono"
"Jfc team stans on this sub, the 6ers absolutely miss a star &amp; a great role player and literally nearly kill the guy they did draft and you list a bunch of dudes including a guy who is in the g league where his upside is backing up your mvp candidate.   It is so lame talking to people who can’t be honest about their team. While we’re at it, I’m feeling really good about Ryan Arcidiacono. That guy just needs some more burn &amp; he’ll be in the all star game convo next year. You heard it from me first."
"Idk, probably Ryan Arcidiacono or maybe Sviatoslav Mykahiluk"

ryan arcidiacono on the Lakers instead of AD?
"For shits and giggles, let’s say the Bulls do sign him (to be the starter), would you move White to the bench then? If Schroder is signed, Satoransky won’t be back, add Ryan Arcidiacono to that list as well."
Trade everyone and build around a Coby White and Ryan Arcidiacono backcourt
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."

Ryan Arcidiacono is listed as well
Ryan Arcidiacono has zero relevance to this conversation.  If he’s playing significant minutes next season then something has gone very wrong.
"If Lonzo and Rose and Ayo and Coby are on the roster, is that one PG too many? Then there’s Ryan Arcidiacono"
"Bulls would have to offer Schroder about $23+ million a year for him to bite since he turned down a $20 million extension from the Lakers. The Bulls have what... $16-$19 million in cap room?  That's not enough, so they would have to dismiss Ryan Arcidiacono with the Team Option, and then trim another $4-$5 million somehow just to get DS interested to chase the Chicago money.  The Lakers are fine with a Harrell resign since it gives them more committed salary to include in a package trade deal for a bigger star."
"He’s not that good haha, but he is 100% hustle - we brought in so many players we had to let go of a few. I mean if the Cavs are picking up Denzel Valentine then I think a team can pick up Ryan Arcidiacono. Although I wouldnt be surprised if he doesn’t get picked up , solid 10/11 man"
"IIRC, among contenders for that backup ball-handler role is Ryan Arcidiacono. I would 100% rather have him, than corpse of Iso Joe."
"&gt; Arcidiacono  https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/bulls-decline-ryan-arcidiaconos-3-million-team-option  ""Candidate to return on min deal, although expected to draw interest"" -- not sure if that's KC Blowing smoke for his dude or serious.  I'd love to have him back on a min deal..."
"Just like how fans of most teams tend to overrate their bench players. Some people on the Bulls sub were bummed about losing Ryan Arcidiacono, the third best point guard on a team that had shitty point guards."
"I’m expecting him to not be a massive liability on offense is all really. Like, be better than Ryan Arcidiacono lmfao, he can’t even do that"
