Luke Kennard is in fact a great shooter
"Over the last 11 games (when Ty Lue stopped playing Reggie, Lou, Luke kennard together), the Clippers have been the #1 overall defense in the league. They've been pretty elite."
Luke Kennard got that deal and got benched after 4 mins. thats tough
Luke Kennard was overrated by clips fans when he was first traded there
"Luke Kennard really came in, bricked 2 3's and got pulled"
Yo the Clippers really gave *Luke Kennard* 4 years 64 million to play him 4 minutes bahahaha
Reggie Jackson is a straight up better player than Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard
luke kennard gonna drop 50 on us
"I'd like to see how these were calculated. Dillon Brooks being a worse defender than Luke Kennard seems a bit off. I wonder if it does not account for who they are guarding, as Kennard is often given easier players to guard and Brooks is usually guards one of the best players on the opposing team."
This is gonna be like the pistons taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell isn’t it...
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
Norm would average 20 a game easy as a starter.  Plenty of room there.  Luke Kennard is a horrendous defensive player
I promise you White is worse than Luke Kennard.   I might take fat “they don’t pay players to play defense” Jabari over him to get a stop if my life depended on it.
"Wow you’re really gonna do Luke Kennard dirty like that, huh?"
"You’ve never seen Luke Kennard. Also, they may have good reason, I’m just a UNC fan that will tolerate 0 Coby slander!!!!"
Hell yeah after what Luke Kennard got easily
"The closest thing to a ""surprise"" is when a team/agent initially reports a deal to make it seem favorable and then additional details are learned a couple days later when interest in the story has died down which make the deal look less favorable. Two different ways this happens, both involving Luke Kennard come to mind.  First, the Luke trade from the Pistons to the Clippers wasn't initially reported with the 2nd round pick obligations. Once those came out, it seemed like a distinctly worse deal for the Pistons to also owe the Clippers all those 2nd round picks.   Second, the Luke Kennard extension. It was initially reported (likely sourced from Kennard's agent) as a 4-years/$64 million deal. In reality, [it's more team-friendly](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/luke-kennard-23607/) with that 4th year being a team option and there being about $2 million in non-guaranteed incentives for each year. The guaranteed contract is actually closer to 3-years/$42 million. If anyone wants bonus details, they are outlined in [this article](https://213hoops.com/luke-kennards-contract-details-clippers-extension/)."
"While I think Trae young is certainly above average as a shooter, LA had Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard as their starting back court last night. That's a defensive tragedy right there."
Pure shooting guard Luke Kennard is their floor general?
I was so sure we’re would draft him.  Just like I was sure we had Donovan Mitchell but we got Luke Kennard.  And I was sure we were taking Devin Booker or Justise Winslow but we took Stanley Johnson.  Sacramento got a steal like he did in this clip
He's active and great in the passing lanes but I watched Luke Kennard take him into the post at will. As long as he weighs barely over 150 he's not stopping anyone.
Luke kennard breaking his back carrying the clippers
Imagine drafting Luke Kennard over this guy.
Luke Kennard doesn’t have much hype or anticipation.
Luke kennard also has an injury history
"Kawhis not Luka or Lebron, he shares ball handling duties with PG and then Luke Kennard when he comes off the bench"
"Kuzma is solid and he's been shot better recently.   But I mean, Luke Kennard (whose contract is constantly compared to Kuzma's) is shooting 3's at 52%, and your entire fanbase was and still is shitting on him."
He’s no Luke Kennard...
"Easily rather have joe harris, are you seriously hyping up luke kennard this much lmao"
Even Luke Kennard has looked solid defensively since the change lol
a very Luke Kennard statline
"Idk how to pull up clips from the game tonight but I don’t see how anyone who has watched the Clippers this year can say Kennard is not a good playmaker. He has absolutely shown it on the Clippers. He’s shooting 50/50/90, with great playmaking, and four million dollars of his contract is tied up in incentives based on his defense and his health, as well as a team option on the fourth year. I don’t see how that is a bad contract at all. If that’s a bad contract then Joe Harris’s contract is the worst contract in league history  I’d advise you to watch more Clippers games so that you can actually watch Luke play before making misinformed comments ab his playmaking ability"
"Luke Kennard is not a really, really, really good playmaker. AST/TO isn't everything but right now he's only dishing out 1.9 assists to 1.2 turnovers per game.   Clippers fans are right to criticize his lack of putting up shots but it isn't because he's passing up 3s to feed someone else. He's simply been too passive.   He's showed flashes of being a good playmaker in Detroit but he's yet to do it on this Clippers team which is one of the reasons people have been critical of his contract."
Luke Kennard
"1. You were talking about **draft class**  2. The 4 2nds are overrated value since you can get good undrafted players (many examples to point to), the future first was extremely heavily protected, Bruce Brown is hardly playing minutes, and Luke Kennard got a huge extension.  Like of all the things you could have mentioned, you didn't mention Christian Wood..."
"Killian over Hali or Deni is already a mistake. He’s playing a G-League level— he can’t be counted on to be the PG of the future. Could’ve taken Maxey, Pritchard or Quickley later and been better off.  They traded a lot to get their next 2 picks. Including Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard 4 2nds and a future first. Stewart at 16 is just a waste. He’s a good culture guy but he’ll never be anything other than a back up C. Bey is great but you can’t build around him. You could’ve taken him at 16 and Quickley at 19 or a high ceiling guy like Hampton or Poku.  3 FRPs and the Pistons still barely have a “young core”."
"kennard is making more than DeJounte Murray and I still see dudes in our sub talking shit about DJs contract. people in general have no idea what a good contract is. and to be fair, Luke has been quite good when he's played but with the injuries and troubles getting back I would think he wouldn't get any MORE expensive if you waited until the off-season."
Anyone else think Luke Kennard looks like Hbomberguy?
No nba teammates could possibly be living a more different reality than Lou Will and Luke Kennard.
"I''ll do Bucks rookies.  Sam Merrill is a poor man's Luke Kennard.    Jordan Nwora is a finesse-oriented pure instant offense guy and not many forwards are like that, tough to compare him to someone.  Maybe a forward version of a poor man's Jamal Crawford?  I think Nwora needs to bring back the shake-and-bake, that totally fits him as he already has the dribble moves and the jump stop, just needs to combine them."
"Lmao I mean why wouldn't we? It's not like that's crazy low volume or anything.   Seth Curry who's known as one of the best shooters in the NBA has only taken 42 3s. Hell even one of the best shooters on your squad, Luke Kennard, who's made a career taking and making 3s has only shot 38 as well.   That volume is about what you'd expect from a 3+D role player like KCP 14 games into the season, especially with him missing a few.   No one thinks he's going to keep shooting that high of a percentage from 3, that'd be ludicrous. However, it's undeniable that he's off to a blazing hot start and there's no reason to think he won't be able to hit his 3s at around a 40-42% rate this year the way he's going right now."
Tatum and Luke Kennard
"I think we're 15-20 games away from Toronto with Lowry's consent to get traded.  And just for hilarity sake, I'll predict some way to the Clippers.     *blah blah blah they don't have any assets*.  Maybe they'll take a flier on people like Oturu, Terrence Mann and idk, Luke Kennard?"
"Clippers. Rough watching Luke Kennard, Reggie Jackson and that other dude off the bench"
"Ty Lue's still figuring out his rotations. Our bench has been extremely bad to start the season, since it consists of three guards who are bad on defense (Lou, Luke Kennard, and Reggie Jackson) and just in general seem to not know how to play together. For that reason Lou's had kind of a rough start to the season despite his counting stats.  That said, our rotations changed in the previous game, and Ty Lue's said he's planning on staggering Lou and Kennard as much as possible from here on out. Additionally, he told Lou to stop worrying about playing in the system and to just return to playing his game. So maybe that'll give Lou the opportunity for some more minutes, depending on which of him vs Kennard are playing better that night."
Luke Kennard is gonna need time. He hasn’t played in a year snd is adjusting to a new system. Sometimes you have to be patient with players
How about Luke Kennard earning similar money? Least OG isn't playing as awful as him
Zo is going to get around 20m a year all the way to the max. People are way over thinking this like they always do. Look how much money Luke Kennard got and realize that Zo was offered a contract that he turned down.   Next year's free agent class is bad and he's one of the biggest names in it. Some team is going to pay him.
"Their bench has no defense and no identity, Lou William/Reggie Jackson/Luke Kennard are like a sieve in defensive side. If Lou William play no offense, he's useless and he's basically become 2017 Jamal Crawford.   &amp;#x200B;  They need to figure how to staggering Kawhi and PG because their second unit are really bad."
"The starters defense is great. The bench defense is historically bad. I think right now its a non-contending, flawed roster because of this. Too many all offense no defense guards off the bench.   The decision to trade for and extend Kennard and hold on to Lou Will was puzzling. Lou’s kind of been fucked over in all this, he’s been a good soldier and playing an egalitarian style but the bench is worse off for it because Kennard isn’t stepping up as a scorer. The bench was as bad defensively last year but Lou having the freedom to cook got us run-stopping buckets frequently, as well as Trez getting to the line. So, I do think this is a negative on Ty Lue’s part and if Lou is on this team he needs to have his freedom restored until Luke Kennard grows a pair of balls.   If anything I appreciate Lue’s experimentation. The bench is painful to watch but at least things are being made abundantly clear that this isn’t a title contender without a move to rectify that. Doc had his guys and player his guys, no matter what the on court evidence was."
"Why would the Sixers ever trade Shake Milton? He's making 10 million less per year than Kennard.   I could see the Hawks trading Rondo, but definitely not for Luke Kennard when they already have...  * Trae Young * Bogdan Bogdanovic  * Kevin Huerter * Cam Reddish  * De'Andre Hunter * Kris Dunn  * Brandon Goodwin   ...to fill out their their ball-handling wing role. Also Rondo makes 10 million less per year as well."
"No, you aren't going to have good defense when your playing Lou Will, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard in the same lineup. That's too much to ask for Morris and Zubac to cover up"
"I wanted to respond to something you said in your OP:  &gt; Maybe stop playing Lou will, Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard together  Is this even an option for the Clippers? Aren't the only other guards they have really just Pat Beverley and Paul George (who's really a wing who's simply playing out of position at guard due to necessity)? Somebody's gotta play those guard minutes and somebody's gotta handle the ball. If it's not those guys, who should it be? You can't play PG and Bev 48 minutes per game."
advanced stats lead to Luke Kennard signing for 64 million. You gotta look at both stats and the eye test.
"I think people are overreacting a little bit. Marcus Morris has missed a lot of games and that's one of the reason why their bench looked so bad. I doubt Lou Williams is going to look so bad for the whole season, and Luke Kennard will improve and look better when the bench is doing better.  Overall, when playoffs come they have their 3-4 main guys off the bench. Zubac, Morris, Kennard and Williams, and you don't need more. The only player with a question mark is Lou Williams. He's 34 and this may be the year where age catches up with him."
Luke Kennard also isnt ready for the role they are going ot ultimately want him to take as a guy they gave $64 mil to.   Lou Williams/George Hill fake trade needs to happen. Zubac has been dust this year also although I have some faith he can turn it around
Luke Kennard played like 0 defense against us.
"Nicolas ""The Basketball God"" Batum   Luke Kennard"
Clippers should take him in a sign and trade for Luke Kennard.
The contract they gave Luke Kennard is basically them suggesting they think he’s that the guy to help be a secondary facilitator for the offense. Which.....well see(only played 18 min tonight also)
"Luke Kennard, Lou will, and Reggie Jackson should never see the floor at the same time cause they can’t play D"
Lou Williams -25  Ivica Zubac -26  Marcus Morris Sr. -20  Luke Kennard -22  Our fucking bench is just Trezz clones Jesus Christ...
puts luke kennard and lou williams in the game and the lead evaporates
Imagine giving Luke Kennard 4/64m.  This franchise is screwed if Kawhi leaves.  Thank god Balmer is rich
"This Clppers bench just bleeeeeeds points - they are so lazy at the 3 point line. That last 3 by Bazemore - Kennard just ""died"" on the screen. He could have easily challenged the shot but pretended he couldn't get past the screen. Then Zubac just isn't protecting the rim at all right now, not sure what's going on with him the last few games     Look at that +/- - Luke , Zu, Lou are -22and worse  lol."
luke kennard is ass cheeks
&gt; Kyle Singler  The OG Luke Kennard
Paschall vs Luke Kennard is the real matchup
why does luke kennard always have the same expression
I’m gonna go with Luke Kennard
"Tbh, Luke Kennard."
what impressed me more was his defense on lou will not luke kennard lmao
I didn't realize Luke Kennard had such striking Shamet Face... Ironic.
Luke Kennard looks as if Michael Keaton played basketball
Luke kennard looks ..... lmao
Bro you are out here comparing KEVIN DURANT and JOHN WALL who literally TORE THEIR ACHILLES to LUKE KENNARD who has knee tendinitis  Flair checks out by the way 😂
60 million for Luke Kennard.
He would have been a restricted free agent and they could always have just re-signed him. Luke kennard is not good enough nor is he healthy enough to warrant giving a hefty extension without a single minute of playing for the team.
"That’s $64 million dollar man Luke Kennard, to you."
"I'm not assuming anything. My point is they'd have had his restricted rights at the end of the year, so why not wait and see if he can stay healthy for the first time in his career before giving him that huge contract? I mean, what are the odds Luke Kennard was going to suddenly go supernova this year and have teams throwing $100 million at him? The guy isn't even a solid starter level player. He should be getting $10 million per year, tops."
Luke Kennard out there with the most minutes on the team too lol
"Patty Mills, Rudy Gay, Reggie Jackson, and Luke Kennard were exceptional for the Spurs"
Luke Kennard played the most minutes of everyone on the court today. Tf
Luke Kennard was a mistake
Luke Kennard for the win......... CLIPS.
Luke Kennard is so bad
"Reggie Jackson, lou Williams, luke kennard all on the same time.  Spurs score a bunch of points.  Shocking."
The goat Luke Kennard is hardly a downgrade
"Lou Will, Pat Bev, Luke Kennard and all their second round picks"
https://lakersdaily.com/montrezl-harrell-appears-throw-shade-clippers-after-sign-luke-kennard-massive-extension/
"It's the reason that a fair amount of people who root for the Clippers do so: it's just another way of rooting against the Lakers. Celtics fans don't want the Lakers to win another title and the Clippers are probably the biggest obstacle to them doing do, so Boston fans are looking for ways to strengthen the Clippers.   Unfortunately for them, because of the hard cap it would be pretty difficult for the Clippers to get Lowry via trade. Probably the best the Clippers could manage is Beverley, Morris and P.Pat for Lowry, and that's if the Raptors had any interest in such a trade. Or if not maybe swap Morris for Lou Williams and Luke Kennard (along with Bev and P.Pat). Those would work."
This a completely different team. No defensive holes with Trezz gone and Ibaka starting/Zu off the bench. A coach that actually knows what adjustments are. Paul George coming off a healthy off season where he had a full summer to train versus rehabbing his shoulders. Luke Kennard is a HUGE upgrade over Shamet. Lakers lost there edge by letting go of McGee and Dwight. You just wait and see. Clips getting to at least the finals this year
This is the most confidence I’ve personally seen Luke Kennard play in a Clippers jersey. I’m happy for him
Luke Kennard
Luke kennard and Terrance Mann get it done
Luke Kennard playing
"He would mesh well with Lamelo, I just don't see the money working out.  The hornets are in the same dilemma with Monk. Both of these guys are headlining a weak FA class so some team will offer them a ridiculous contract. At a minimum they will get Luke Kennard money."
Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey for Rubio
This guy cannot even make it through a whole game. I’m so glad my Pistons drafted the stud Luke Kennard over him. /s
Are 11 2nd rounders worth enough?  u/LAClippers get:  Bradley Beal  Alex Len  u/WashWizards get:  Lou Williams  Marcus Morris Sr.  Luke Kennard  Patrick Patterson  2022 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2023 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2024 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2025 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2026 - RD 2  2027 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/Oe3lbVZ00
He’s anything but coddled wtf are you talking about. An out of bounds turnover because he thought the ref was Luke kennard was the highest upvoted post of the night
Anyone call Luke Kennard the Nard Dog or what
"We have Reggie Jackson, Lou will and Luke kennard playing defense though."
Free Luke Kennard
Luke kennard super deep in ty lues dog house
"The thing is that though the self-perpetuating cycle argument makes sense, the top of the draft recently leans heavily towards the East.  Over the last seven or eight years, the very top of the draft has been all Eastern Conference teams.  2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 an East team had the #1 pick.  Lot of Cleveland up there after LeBron Left.  Philly and Boston at the top of the draft in the last few years, lot of Orlando and New York a few years before that.  It's really just Sacramento and Minnesota that have repeatedly been in the lottery because it's usually like the 10th best team in the West is a lot better and so they end up lower in the draft than the 10th team in the East.      It's probably just as likely that it's the fault of bad front offices (no offense) than the cycle of the top West teams beating up on the bottom.  Orlando and New York have had a lot of swings in the lottery since 2012 and don't have much to show for it.  The Pistons picked Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson and Luke Kennard with the 8th, 18th, and 12th picks.  Charlotte completely whiffed on lottery picks from 2012-2017.      I think there have been some quirky things that have skewed the East draft results though, mainly that two good teams ""snuck"" into the top of thanks to really atypical situations.  The Sixers tanking + the Celtics fleecing the Nets meant for a few years there, the rich just got richer in the East and that really threw things off.  That really hasn't happened in the West, because the best teams have never picked high and for teams like the Rockets or Mavs, a lot of years they didn't even have a pick.  Warriors getting Wiseman is the closest thing."
"Also predictable when Lou Williams, Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson are playing that much. They're trying to play Terrance Mann more because he's the only bench guard who can defend."
"Kennard 8/3/2 on 46/44/87 shooting in 21mpg Kuzma 11/6/1 on 45/36/61 shooting in 26mpg  Luke is a much better shooter, good ball handler, creates his own shot, isn’t a great defender but not horrible either. Kuzma gets you barely more on worse shooting in more mpg. And let’s not pretend he’s a great defender because he’s improved a bit on that end. He’s decent. Luke is also integrating himself into a new team and system. He will figure it out and improve, he’s better than his stats say."
So basically a playable version of Luke Kennard or a chunky LaMelo
Luke Kennard and Terrance Mann for Lowry should get it done.
Luke Kennard?
Luke Kennard and Patrick Patterson

"I said Philly has better trade options than the clippers and Toronto you must have misunderstood what I said. And again the clippers do have draft picks if y’all just looked it up you would see they got 4 picks back in the trade for Kennard. Wether u want to say second round picks are good or not is a different thing, but they have picks.    https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2918739-report-landry-shamet-traded-to-nets-luke-kennard-to-clippers-in-3-team-deal.amp.html"
Why in a hell would Raptors take Luke Kennard and a second for Lowry?
"Send him, we’ll throw in pat bev and Luke kennard, please and thank you...plus Serge and kawhi will be pleased"
&gt; given up lou and bev   For Lowry? 😂   I think the most the clippers would give is Luke Kennard and a second.  No way the clippers would banish Lou back to ~~Canada~~ Tampa
Realistically Terrence Mann and Luke Kennard and the 4 draft picks that they got this year and salary matching money wise . Yes it’s normally not a good package but Toronto said they want to send him to a contender so you would assume that they don’t expect even value. Anything more than that and you start stripping away what would make the clippers a contender in the first place
"The clippers have 4 draft picks that they acquired in the trade for Luke Kennard. They have Portland’s 2023, Detroit’s 2024, 2025 and 2026 all 2nd rounders as part of the 3 team trading of shamet to the Nets. They also got the rights to Jay Scrubb in the deal."
"The clippers actually do have picks, in the trade for Luke Kennard they received 4 2nd round draft picks. If  Lowry wanted to go to La they could offer Luke kennard and Terrence Mann along with all 4 picks."
"Draft picks, Luke Kennard and Terrence mann. Luke has been struggling a bit in the games but he’s still a 40% 3pt shooter and Mann is starting to become a really good rotational player. Normally this trade wouldn’t go through because it’s Lowry but they said they want to trade him to a contender so it’s kinda expected that you aren’t going to be getting the pieces that make them a contender in the first place."
"Pistons are going full rebuild and are stockpiling draft picks. Bruce needs a new deal next year (I think) and the pistons weren't going to pay him. He's made good progress every year, there was just a new regime here and this is pretty normal. 2nd round pick who's a starter on a really bad team, rotation guy on a good one.   Troy weaver hit the reset button. It's why Luke kennard got shipped out too."
nah - lue said they'd play mann or kennard based on matchups. Luke really needs to be more confident. Mann plays with immense confidence
Can we send Luke Kennard to the G league?
Mr. 64 million Luke kennard deep in ty lues dog house
worried this might be a trap game for us since wizards are on a b2b after an OT win but i love the wizzies so i’m just here to have fun lol go everyone!! i wanna see russ and beal ball out and wanna see some good looks from luke kennard
"i feel like lonzo isn’t really the *ideal* player the sixers need, but the problem is that the ideal player the sixers need is not available at the moment   outside of an actual backup center, the sixers need three things really: shooters (especially willing shooters), passers/playmakers (Simmons is the only above average passer on the team) and versatile defenders (preferably to defend guards; green is cooked as far as man defense goes). lowry is ideal, but he’s tough to attain if he even becomes available. lonzo would at least provide some of those needs, and could play in a variety of lineups (with ben as an off ball wing shooter type, and in place of ben to keep the grab n go energy up a bit when ben rests).   his lack of ability to dribble penetrate definitely hurts, but guys that can dribble penetrate that are also good enough to play with ben and jo are pretty scarce on the trade market. his defense is a tad overrated imo but he’s still a marked upgrade over basically everyone other than embiid and simmons. the team badly needs smart players that shoot threes at a high clip and i think he’d excel in that role here  and i’d be comfortable extending him for around luke kennard money in the summer. maybe a little bit more, top out at like 20 mil per (i think that’s what hollinger pegged him as worth)"
"If it was just based on defense, Luke Kennard"
who tf is luke kennard
That plays? Luke Kennard.   On the roster? Kabengele
Can't wait to watch Luke Kennard give up 79 points  FTFY
Can’t wait to watch Luke Kennard drop 79 points
I’ve always liked Henry Ellison’s game. The guy just never caught a break. But Detroit ruins everything. Detroit drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. And There has to be a spot for James Young somewhere.
second half luke kennard was good lmao
Luke kennard
if i was an nba announcer i would constantly be trying to weave in references to 'the truth' whenever luke kennard made a play. since canard means lie
"He might have played well, but all that did was delay the inevitable rebuild a few more years. He got us a grand total of 1 playoff appearance and 0 playoff wins. We should have done a full rebuild 10 years ago but instead we kept struggling to make the playoffs every so often which has lead to an all-time NBA record 14 straight playoff losses. We were never able to get any great players to turn the franchise around because we kept getting mid-round 1sts. We also were trying to ""win now"" which lead to decisions like taking Luke Kennard or Donovan Mitchell. I thought the trade was terrible from day one and I turned out to be right."
"We should’ve traded Blake last year and kept C wood but typical pistons office, I’m from the D and I’m tired of this team, we draft kcp over the Greek freak we draft Luke kennard over don Mitchell, we gave Reggie to much money we gave up T Harris Avery Bradley and boban for Blake and now we needa trade him, shit is a waste of time, not to mention we give up our franchise center who’s been leading league rebounding for years for fucking Brandon knight and I never even seen him this whole year, we draft killigan hates over obi toppin shit crazy, grant is pretty good but 60 mil cmon man that’s way to much, at this point idk what we should do we have nothing. We should’ve found a way to trade Reggie for Kemba but we dropped the ball so bad if we were gonna get rid of Drummond and Reggie we could’ve used them in a big trade package, our roster is shit and we really have no players that anyone want we just gotta pray pistons fans hopefully the new GM knows what he’s doing because he did a good job in OKC"
5 of the top 20 (qualified) 3 point clips belong to Clippers players:  Marcus Morris - 48.4  Paul George - 47.8  Nicolas Batum - 45.6  Luke Kennard - 44.4  Patrick Beverley - 43.6
"if luke kennard can get a 50 mil bag, duncan can get some racks too."
Donte is a decent 3 and D player but he is 24 which is not old but also not very young by any means. I think he will end up being a decent player with averages of like 12-13 points on 40% shooting. I think the best comparison for Donte would be Luke Kennard. Both were solid 3rd year players but not great and not future all star caliber player. Luke Kennard went for the 19th overall pick and I would say that’s pretty fair value for Donte.   Brook is 32 and while his contract is not bad it is not that attractive. Next 2 seasons he will be making 27.2 million and the question is that do I really want to be putting 14 million into my cap space for Brook Lopez? He’s not a negative asset but he certainly is not a very attractive one given his age and how he is a pretty bad rebounder. I can’t see Brook Lopez being a very attractive asset and more so be salary filler   As for your trades there is no way Charlotte gives up Rozier who is balling out and biyombo for that package.   As for the second package I don’t think Milwaukee does that. Ricky Rubio looks super washed this year and his numbers look awful even on a garbage Timberwolves team   I think a good target for them would be Terrance Ross. He can create his own shot pretty well and he can get very hot very fast. Past 2 playoff runs for the Magic he is also averaging 15 points on 56 TS
Luke Kennard unironically dropping 40
"""The Living Embodiment of the Divine Masculine"" - Enes Kanter, Terry Rozier and Luke Kennard"
He’s also making less than Luke Kennard. Great value for the Lakers getting that extension done.
Have you seen luke kennard play defense?
Luke Kennard is complete ass and I'm glad we traded him for the pick that landed us THIS MONSTER.
"Rozier for Lou Will, what y’all say Hornets fans??? Throw in Luke Kennard if you’re lucky."
Yeah but they’re not going to trade their best PG for an overpaid Luke Kennard and Ibaka.
Luke Kennard and old Ibaka for Kyrie who’s having a great season? With no picks attached (Clips don’t have any). Yeah that’s a shit deal. Nets aren’t trading Kyrie for an overpaid role player and an aging Ibaka. They can get another center somewhere else for cheap without having to give up one of their best players.
Steve Nash is going to be the man to teach Luke Kennard how to play defense?  Really?  With the help of Mike D'Antoni?
If Luke Kennard doesn't make tier 3 I'm gonna lose it.
"&gt; this trade seems like a robbery for the Clippers.  Actually I think it would leave the Clippers in a rough spot, as they'd be trading 4 players for 1, and due to the hard cap they wouldn't have any money left over to sign even vet min guys to fill those empty roster spots. That's rough for a roster which would be as unbelievably top heavy as the Clippers would be, with their entire bench now being basically Luke Kennard and Marcus Morris, and with Ibaka as the only guy on the whole roster who could play center."
"2017 draft on the other was pretty bad tho lol Lonzo, Fultz, Josh Jackson, Ntilikina, DSJ, Zach Collins, Malik Monk, Luke Kennard, all didn't pan out. Imagine if I told you that that you your team has a 57% chance at drafting a disappointment"
The Donte DiVincenzo disrespect! /s  And Alex Caruso.  And Luke Kennard.  And Pat Connaughton.
Luke Kennard is not much of a defender tho.
Luke Kennard
A prime Luke Kennard would be the best player on either team.
I don’t blame him. I felt the same way about Luke Kennard after we lost to the Clippers.
"Dude we’re playing 4 rookies, a ten-day contract, a 32 year old, 2 second year guys, and Cory freaking Joseph. We have ONE very good player right now. We also traded away two former MVPs and another All-star, didn’t re-sign Christian Wood, and traded Luke Kennard and Bruce brown. How are we trying to make the playoffs? 😂"
Luke Kennard shooting right handed would be the best shooter on the lakers
"Yeah, I didn't consider the injury component at the Clippers vs Brooklyn minutes with DeAndre. I'll watch Mann a bit more. That game Kennard went off was unreal, him and Mann are eating. I really like Luke, though I haven't seen his liability side yet enough. Interested to see what happens when Rondo comes in."
"Seth is underrated, KCP is underrated, Luke Kennard is underrated"
"No, he's just a complete nothing player. Joe Harris makes zero difference for that team in terms of championship potential.  Is Seth Curry underrated? Is KCP underrated? Is Luke Kennard underrated? Those are the comparisons for someone like Joe Harris."
Luke Kennard trade not looking good tbh
It's not surprising that the team that needed Luke Kennard to turn supernova in order to beat the Hawks is losing to the Nuggets.
"Let’s summarize.  1) Due to the need for matching salaries, It’s quite hard to trade for veterans on expiring $25-40M contracts like Drummond, LMA, and Blake were on. Not only is it hard to match salaries, but league execs/and the nephews of r/nba didn’t even think these players were all that good apparently. Niko Mirotic/Luke Kennard cost 4 second rounders. Fournier was an expiring this year and was able to yield *TWO* 2nd round picks.   Meanwhile, Drummond was available last year with another year of team control and was only able to yield a single 2nd round pick, and none this year. If he’s so useful, and so impactful to possibly swing an nba championship, then why didn’t a cap space/play in level team trade for him before the deadline?...(crickets) Exactly.  2) The teams that bought these players out did so because it was in THEIR OWN BEST interests. It was not an act of charity.  Cleveland wanted to fully evaluate and develop their young stud Jarrett Allen and see how he fits with their young core. If they’re going to pay him $100 million this summer, they want to see him for 40 minutes a night.  LMA had lost his starting spot and the Spurs were an also ran/first round cannon fodder and LMA has never been very far in the playoffs.  Blake was a low efficiency chucker who was taking up developmental minutes. Even worse, he was definitely going to be on the team next year for another $40 million.  3)The players were so desperate to play for a contending team, that they made quite large concessions.  Drummond lost the bird rights that he could have retained by getting traded to another over the cap team. That would have increased the number of potential teams that could sign him to a big contract this summer.  LMA forfeited over $8 million in salary which helped the Spurs to dodge the luxury tax this season. That will be an issue for them as they start to pay to retain this young core and avoided an early repeater tax issue which could potentially prematurely kill their current team build.  Blake forfeited some $10 million this year *PLUS* his player option for $40 million next year which is probably $25-30 million over his  market value this summer.  It’s honestly hard to see the amount of whining in r/nba and the National media about washed up veterans who will probably be the 8th/9th most impactful player on the nets postseason success and Drummond, a player who for years has been dumped on as a guy who “contributes nothing to winning” but magically transforms into Kareem when he puts on a Lakers uniform.  Let’s not forget the players union angle echoed by JJ Reddicks comments about the Pelicans front office. Why can’t veterans with 10-15 years in the league and entering free agency decide where THEY want to play? Is it not enough that players can’t hit unrestricted free agency until they’re practically 7-8 years into the league even though most careers end before that date? Now they have to go to Memphis when they get cut because “it’s not fwair (include tears) that NY:LA gets them? Were these buyout vets going to sign with NY/LA 2-3 years ago when these teams were dumpster fires? No. So obviously the on court stuff matters more than the “boo hoo big market” angle that’s getting pushed by the media.  Would you be happy with your corporate job if they tried to restrict your freedom of movement after you’ve been with them for 10-15 years?  Whining about washed big men in a perimeter oriented league is honestly a pathetic hill for people to die on."
&gt;11. Luke Kennard
HOW MUCH HELP DOES LUKE KENNARD NEED?!
How much help does Luke Kennard need ffs
"Also, Luke Kennard returned to playing like Luke Kennard this game."
"Luke Kennard is my favorite, because I'm left handed in basketball only and if I was 6'5"", my playstyle would be exactly like his. Left-handed bro's gotta stick together."
"Pistons drafted Luke Kennard ahead of Donovan Mitchell. Bam Adebayo was still on the board but it was clearly between Kennard and Mitchell for the 12th pick, and at this point it's pretty much indefensible."
Donovan Mitchell. We took the Nard dog (Luke Kennard)
Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell (LOL)
Add Luke Kennard (LAC) to this list
top 30 is sort of underselling it. but yeah regardless luke kennard went off
I mean that’s going to happen when Luke “the nard” kennard is playing
Luke Kennard just killed some deer
Luke Kennard is a god amongst mere mortals
"Luke Kennard posting up a 21/5/2 statline on 73/83 splits, while being +20 on the floor is not something I expected"
"the nets signed KD, kyrie, DJ, harden, blake, and aldridge just to beat terance mann and luke kennard. and it won't even work"
[serious] is Luke kennard the most underpaid player in the league?
What in the goddamn fuck have we done to Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard to deserve this?
"luke kennard is having such a weird season, some games he is benched and if he plays it's only in garbage time, other games he's a key piece hitting clutch jumpers and automatic from 3"
Luke kennard my goodness
"So, this is a testament to both the Pistons' ineptitude and Andre's but it was basically, ""Anyone but Andre"".   In the 2017 postseason, it was Reggie Jackson (who actually had a great season that year, with some all-star buzz even), then a mix of Tobias Harris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Marcus Morris.  In 2019, Blake Griffin still played half of that series, so he was still the No. 1 option, even with a bum leg. For the rest of the series, it was Reggie Jackson then whoever else could run off a screen - Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Langston Gallaway, etc.   Looking at Andre's field goal attempts can be odd when trying to find out where he stood as an option because a number of those shots were from offensive rebounds and put-back attempts. Without those putbacks, he was generally shooting 10 times a game or less, with many of *those* shots coming via pick &amp; roll lob and the others often coming from Andre trying to iso off the dribble or attempt one his awful hooks (or god forbid, a 3-pointer)."
"For whatever it's worth, even with Blake out, Andre was not the Pistons' first option, nor has he ever been. Pistons coaches have been variably open to trying to give Andre some touches in hopes of developing any semblance of a post game but they've all known better than to try to pretend he'd be a first or second option under any circumstances.  Injured Blake was still the first option for half of that series. Then it was pretty much anyone but Andre for the rest of the series. Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Ish Smith, Wayne Ellington.   Andre's numbers can look deceiving; folks will interpret him as a certain option based off his scoring average. But his points are often a result of tip-ins or pick &amp; roll dunks. The times where he actually touched the ball as an option of sorts usually resulted in disaster on account of his incredibly low offensive skill (except for the few times where it works out, which then end up on a mixtape that makes him look like he's great).  Frankly, his TS%, for the type of skills he has, should probably be hovering around 65 percent or higher, because he has no business doing anything but dunking and tipping on offense."
Luke Kennard when playing the Hawks.
They also keep getting sneaky good games out of their role players. They win a 20 point comeback behind Luke Kennard last week. They win after a career night from Terrance Mann a couple days ago.
"He played, and didn't dunk with Ish Smith, Derrick Rose,  Langston Galloway, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard. All guards who can throw a lob. Bruce does it frequently now. All that said the gravity the stars on the nets cause opens up alot of space. Blake just isn't good enough to outright beat guys anymore. He needs to be open and he wasn't for us. He's not a good first second or third option. But he can be a solid 5th or 6th on a stacked team. It's no conspiracy."
I 100% think Malik Monk should be above people like Luke Kennard.      Monk has proven this year he can be a big time shooter and creator.
They got a huge starting centre upgrade with serge ibaka   They got a huge upgrade from Landry shamet to Luke Kennard  And they have a play off upgrade from lou Williams to rajon rondo   PG has also been playing amazing  Saying the clippers are the same is a casual take
Yeah what’s up man I’m Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard with the Euro half court buzzer beater
Luke Kennard got 64. When Drummond helps the Lakers repeat he's getting at least 80.
All this to beat Luke Kennard and Terance Mann?
1. Kawhi 2. Paul George 3. Marcus Morris 4. Patrick Beverley 5. Serge Ibaka 6. Ivica Zubac 7. Nicolas Batum 8. Terance Mann 9. Reginald Jackson 10. Luke Kennard
1. Kawhi Leonard             2. Paul George            3. Patrick Beverley              4. Serge Ibaka          5. Marcus Morris         6. Ivica Zubac          7. Nicolas Batum         8. Reggie Jackson         9. Terance Mann         10. Luke Kennard
"KD, Kyrie, Harden, Blake and LMA  All to beat Terance Mann and Luke Kennard"
oh hey luke kennard sighting
Will Luke Kennard play?
"You don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about lmfao.   Bruce brown was sent in one big trade with Luke kennard. that’s how we got Bey. They were just announced separately.   And Wood just did not want to stay in Detroit for a reasonable price - hell, we don’t even know if he wanted to stay for any price at all. Wood is a fantastic player but for a team that needs to dump everything and tank, we definitely made the right move by not dumping salary into Wood (if he would’ve even taken it), and doing what we could in a sign and trade  There’s a reason this sub sucks sometimes Bc huge casuals like you who talk about stuff they literally know nothing about"
Watch us get Luke Kennard back
"Luke Kennard has been playing well lately tho, [here's some of his highlights, he's not bad ](https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo)"
Still better than Luke Kennard. I’ll forgive the Pistons once we’ve got Cade and Emoni Bates
"To be fair, I think the 4th year is a team option. It’s an overpay, but not terrible. It is terrible that all that money is tied up in Luke fucking Kennard in Kawhi and PG’s prime."
&gt; he’s signed for a cap friendly contract for three more years after this one  I remember early in the year people around here were legit asking which extension signing was better: Kuzma or Luke Kennard 😂
only read title mb its Luke Kennard
"Clippers would not have max contract space. They've locked up Beverly, Kennard, and Zubac for 34.5m. Along with Paul George (40m) that leaves ~35m, minus roster holds. That's less than the max even before considering rosters holds. The Clippers could maybe bring in a borderline max guy (Julius Randle, Zach Lavine) but the true max guys aren't going to take a pay cut to go play with PG13, Beverly, and Luke Kennard."
Fuckin' Luke Kennard

What has happened to Luke Kennard. Dude got paid then just dipped
"You can only imagine my reaction when I saw Luke Kennard in the top 10. I swear every seldom Clippers game I watch he isn't hitting threes during the game, and goes 2-8 from distance or something. Coulda fooled me."
Lou Williams is blamed for everything lately. We have a lot of fans that think Luke Kennard is a good player
"Svi has been really bad this year, but last year he did Luke Kennard's job better than Luke Kennard."
"Hey look, Luke Kennard getting minutes.  Remember when we drafted him when we were projected to draft Donovan Mitchell.  Yes I’m salty"
I honestly feel like Clippers should’ve tried to make a move on Lonzo last offseason instead of paying Luke Kennard that money
LUKE KENNARD   Top asset
"We have Luke ""MJ"" Kennard and Jay ""Pippen"" Scrubb ready to lead the charge."
"They're having a historical shooting season. I couldn't believe it until I looked it up.

can clippers just luke kennard have the ball
Lue needs to stop with these bench rotations with no shooters that can create. If Mann isn’t attacking with the ball in his hands there is no point with him on the floor. Put in Luke so he can at least spread the floor.   Bench has been getting killed the last four games. Only time it wasn’t was when Kennard got playing time.
The moment Lue decides to put in Luke Kennard  the other team can just give up its over
*Luke Kennard
"Be honest: you deserved to be MVP of the 2017 ACC tournament over Luke Kennard, right?"
 How much help does Luke Kennard need
Because the Pistons drafted him. Sometimes it’s that simple. The Detroit franchise drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell in successive drafts. The Pistons draft the wrong guys. It’s what they do.
"So basically your argument that he's not mediocre is that he averaged 55% from 3 for under a month. Do you realize he's basically league average for TS% and 38% on 3s this season? I'm not going to do the math, but that implies he's shot like a monkey throwing darts since his hot streak.  Let's give a max to KCP, Caruso, Luke Kennard, Kyle Korver, insert random player here too then if that's your basis for saying CJ is not mediocre."
"Ok then theres rondo,reggie,mann, or even luke kennard outplaying him"
"Marcus Morris comes off the bench and is very good, lord thiccolas has been great, rondo has been a revelation since he got here, Reggie Jackson is more than solid, and luke kennard and Terrence Mann have been very good.  We’re a very deep team who’s bench just won a game against a good team down 6 people."
Luke Kennard is still a huge overpay

I keep thinking Luke Kennard is Kawhi Leonard when I scan box scores. Lol
Because the clippers have the deepest team in the league and Luke Kennard is a stud muffin.
Kawhi Kennard and Luke Leonard are my favorite starters.
Is Luke Kennard in the regular rotation?

Simply put Luke Kennard on any team
Imagine trading this guy for luke fucking kennard
What. The. Fuck. How is it even possible to be worse than Luke Kennard defensively? All you have to do to be better than him is attempt to play the minimum amount of defense.
If you want a defensive disaster replace Bledsoe with Luke Kennard.

I can not wait to come back to this comment when Luke Kennard is getting exposed in these playoffs.
what is UP guys! Matisse here with a new vlog and today i'll be SHITTING all over LUKE KENNARD (Bum!) (#NotInMyHouse) (Gone Wrong!)
"Shit, just last week I saw people calling the Kemba contract the worst. Or the Luke Kennard contract the worst a couple weeks ago. Apparently it changes week to week."
clippers fans:  how is Luke Kennard doing? ik he got the bag this offseason and hes been in and out of the rotation.
"1 and 2 are huge mistakes. 3 is over-blown. He had a better deal but it fell through, not his fault IIRC. 4, Drafted Chriss and traded for Papagiannis and Bogdanovic. Out of the next 5 picks after Chriss only Sabonis is better than Bogdanovic. Donovan and Bam were the last 2 picks in the lottery, it wasn't the obvious choice like Luka. The Kings were more likely to drafty Malik Monk or Luke Kennard. Yes, Vlade is a bad GM because he did not predict Devin Booker would turn into an all-star. Do you think the 14 teams that passed on Giannis were idiots also?"
"Both of these articles reference the event, I've seen a couple of beat writers for the clippers mention it as well. Reggie was not playing well early in the year, and there was already a log jam at point guard. Ty Lue told Reggie to stay ready and when some injuries happened Reggie stepped in with whole new energy to how he played.   I remember those days with him on the Pistons, and even during his days on the Thunder when he would complain about his role versus Westbrook. He's come a long way in a short time; it's impressive to see. Playing on a veteran team probably helps too.  https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-04-10/clippers-reggie-jackson-patrick-beverley-injured  https://www.si.com/nba/clippers/news/ty-lue-met-with-lou-williams-reggie-jackson-and-luke-kennard"
Luke Kennard probably idk
He showed Luke Kennard how a revenge game is properly done
If you told me last year that Luke Kennard would be taking the fewest 3s of all of them I would've believed you because dude is a whole pansy.
"Terance Mann, Reggie Jackson, and sometimes Luke Kennard"
"James Harden (25.2), Jokic (26.2), Thybulle (3.9),  Luke Kennard (7.9),  Myles turner, (12.7). Total of 75.9."
or Luke Kennard in a game 7   after DNP most of the series and a shit 2 points in Game 6  but decides to play him Game 7 and gets 11 Points from him
They are but gobert was being guarded by Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson in the post  If they can’t get the post entry on those it’s a big miss
Loved how Eagle said it’s the Spider-Man meme when Luke Kennard guarded Joe Ingles
Luke Kennard looks like the type of guy who makes sure everyone’s seat is secure before they start the roller coaster
Bruh no way this dumb as rocks commentator is blaming Luke Kennard for that.
lol luke kennard low basketball iq
Luke kennard always looks stoned
if luke kennard isnt gonna shoot why even play him
Lue have we learned nothing about playing Luke Kennard in the 4th.
Marcus Morris Nic Batum Reggie Jackson Paul George Luke Kennard is really enough to beat the jazz. Wow
"Did I hear that right? Announcer just said ""Luke Kennard against Joe Ingles in a Spiderman meme"" ???"
OK WHY THE HELL DO THEY NOT FEED GOBERT WHEN HE'S HANGING OUT IN THE PAINT WITH LUKE KENNARD OR PET BAV ON HIM??
A healthy Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard needs to channel his inner KD this game

GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN LUKE KENNARD AND TERANCE MANN ARE ON THE FLOOR
Has Luke Kennard missed a 3 in these playoffs? He looks so automatic to me
"Cam Payne.  Luke kennard. Saric.  Grayson Allen.    Campazzo. Austin rivers.   I haven't watched much eastern ball but maybe bruce brown, shamet, blake Griffin"
In this hypothetical PG doesn't have to be the first option. First option can be Luke Kennard.
"And if I have luke kennard in my team, my team is bound to go 0-2 comeback"
"I can't with r/NBA, I have continuously told people that Luke Kennard is the greatest of all time"
If Luke Kennard is getting DNPs this season shooting near 50% from 3 then some short unfit fatty isn’t getting anything. They’d just get blocked 90% of the time anyway.
I still feel Luke Kennard will be the greatest of all time after not reading of whatever you tryna say.
luke kennard and reggie jackson are the kings of timely shots
"Jamal Crawford was never efficient and a black hole on defense. Morris is a versatile 3-5 guy who can legitimately space the floor. Yeah, I know JJ played minutes and he was never good in any of them. Ty Lue doesn't know how to use Luke Kennard cause he's not the brightest crayon, but if Chris Paul just had any help of offensive creation/floor spacing other than Blake, it's a wrap, those Clippers teams would have murdered teams. I think those Clipper team were better than this current crop bc of CP, but in terms of overall talent, it's not even a question."
Did you know Luke Kennard is Ambidextrous?\#LukeKennardFactOfTheDay
"We don't need a great roll man, Cole Aldrich was fantastic when he got to play with Chris Paul (would pout up similar stats to DJ). Zubac can be as good as Cole Aldrich. And no, if Chris Paul had a Marcus Morris as a 3rd/4th option who can actually create a bucket for himself and has done so on other teams, then they'd have been much more dangerous. Luke Kennard is a better passer and ball-handler than JJ Redick. Same goes for Nic Batum, and then you include Batum's versatile defensive. Even a Terrance Mann would help. Those Clippers only had about 6 playable guys."
The black Luke Kennard
Joe Ingles is a fat Luke Kennard
"Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard combo from yesterday was really bad. Maybe not quite as bad cause Jackson at least has some size, tho kennard is legit one of the worst defenders I've ever seen"
"Yeah, I’d only pay Luke Kennard that money...."
"I know you only are aware of GOAT luke Kennard, but there are other players in the NBA. This is one of them"
&gt; The more I see and hear about Donovan Mitchell the more I like him.   I've been butthurt for the longest time because we passed on him in favor of Luke Kennard but the man is brilliant. Can't help but respect what he's doing right now.
why in the fuck did luke kennard got that contract
"I mean.   Ty Lue did go to the Zone, which got them back into the game.   You can't blame Ty Lue for Marcus Morris shitting the bed in both games, Paul George launching bricks until the 4th quarter in game one, or Kahwi disappearing in game 2 in the fourth.  What you can blame Ty Lue for is his line-ups and rotation. For a playoff team, the Clippers have no idea who is going to play in the game and how long they are going to play.   Luke Kennard   * Game 1 - 29 minutes / 18 points  * Game 2 - 10 Minutes / 3 Points  Rajon Rondo   * Game 1 - 28 Minutes / 5-5-6  * Game 2 - DNP  Patrick Beverly  * Game 1 - 6 Minutes 0-1-1  * Game 2 - 20 Minutes 3-3-1  Demarcus Cousins  * Game 1 - 3 minutes / 6 points  * Game 2 - 11 minutes / 6 points  Terance Mann  * Game 1 - 8 Minutes / 2-1-1  * Game 2 - 1 Minute  Nicolas Batum  * Game 1 Started - 20 minutes - 6/4/2  * Game 2 Bench - 27 minutes - 7/3/2  Ivica Zubac  * Game 1 Bench - 20 Minutes - 11 Points  * Game 2 Started - 13 Minutes - 7 Points"
That's almost Luke kennard  money.
Why did SVG choose Luke Kennard over this guy
"So Ty Lue *finally* found the right rotation and guys to play in Games 6+7 in that Mavs series (benched Beverley and Rondo, played Mann more and gave Kennard some spot minutes) and literally decides to go away from it in the first 2 games of this series.   I understand the desire to play Zubac more as you can't go small for the full 48 and guys will wear down, esp Batum who is probably going to be gassed at the end of this playoffs, but the guard rotation is inexplicable.   Here are the things T-Lue needs to do with his rotations:  1. Start Batum, put Marcus Morris on the bench, Morris's 3s aren't falling right now and his scoring is better served off the bench when Kawhi + PG aren't playing. Kawhi + PG + Batum have an amazing +/- when they are on the floor together.   2. Bench Pat Bev and play Terance Mann more. Mann gives you exactly what you think Pat Bev is giving you, and the fact that Bev can't make shots anymore drastically reduces his value on the court, the Jazz don't respect him at all and don't guard him. Yeah Mann isn't a great shooter, but he can slash to the rim, he cuts, he puts pressure on the rim, which the Clips need to do to get the Jazz in rotation for those 3s they get off of movement, which is what they do when they're at their best.   3. Play Luke Kennard every second that Donovan Mitchell is not on the floor. He may already be doing this, but I would really make a point of emphasis on doing this, Kennard's shooting is invaluable right now for a team that is struggling to shoot 3s.   4. Like Kennard, Boogie should be out there in every second that Mitchell is not on the floor, he provides useful spacing whilst also being a rim deterrent, and he can also mash Favors in the post when he is out there.   Overall the minutes leaderboard for the Clips should look like this:   1. PG (it's far easier for him to play 40+ minutes than it is for Kawhi who needs more rest)  2. Kawhi  3. Batum (this might exhaust him, but you're going to lose if he doesn't play more minutes)  4. Reggie   5. Mook  6. Mann  7. Kennard  8. Zubac  9. Boogie"
Luke Kennard
"This is a bad take. Your poor understanding of basketball knowledge shows.  Kawhi dominated the Mavericks because the Mavericks have poor defensive personnel. The Mavericks have no one to guard Kawhi one on one and their bigs, Porzingis and Boban, aren't good defenders.   Mitchell has so far torched the Clippers because he's hot and he's got some favorable matchups with Luke Kennard guarding him. All Mitchell is is hot right now. Clarkson was also hot hitting very tough shots and bombing 3s.   The story is the same so far as it was in the Dallas series. The Dallas role players were hot while for the most part the Clippers were not. They won the first 2 games on 50% shooting from 3. When the Clippers adjusted and they came down to earth, the Clippers won the next 4/5 games, with 3 of them being rather comfortable.  Right now Mitchell torched the Clippers in game 1. After one half in game 2, the zone defense quieted him down, actually shut him down. Clarkson hit absurd shots. Paul George and most of the Clippers continue to shoot poorly from 3 despite having decent looms. And Kawhi still hasn't gone off yet. And the Jazz have barely won both games at home. Force Mitchell to his left, prevent match up hunting, and working on that zone and the Clippers have what it takes to stop the Jazz from manufacturing points. And if Morris and others even remotely shoot how they did in the regular season then this series is totally different.  Anyone taking stock in 2-0 series lead when the outcomes of the games are very close are asking to make a fool of themselves."
Ty Lue: we’re going to try and have Luke Kennard guard you  Jordan: Oh no! Anyway…
Yelling at Luke Kennard to foul? He was going to kill Kennard for not fouling there.
"To be specific, Kennard wasn't fouling. Reggie Jackson was going to kill Luke Kennard for not fouling though."
Shades of Luke Kennard here
The real story of this clip is reggie jackson and kennard. The fuck was luke thinking?
While cooking the fucking bum we took over him. I fucking hate Luke Kennard.
espn: also fuck luke kennard
Why is Luke Kennard on the floor let alone guarding Mitchell on a defensive possession?
Luke Kennard on the floor in the clutch? Not a serious team.
Luke Kennard is Tom from Succession
Luke Kennard even when he tries gets scored on.
you go on a run and put in luke kennard?  goddammit
Unironically Luke Kennard should get more PT this half. Pray Zubac doesn't foul out and don't really go to Booige anymore just play 5 out as much as possible if Zu can't be on the floor.
"Luke ""drafted before Donovan Mitchell"" Kennard with the three."
It's the year 2030....and teams are still leaving Luke Kennard wide open for some reason.
"could luke kennard be the next ""16 game player"""
What about Luke Kennard?
Jazz going at Paul George like he’s Luke kennard
I swear to god people think this is still free agency in 2004. Luke Kennard gets $16m
"How bad was Stan Van Gundy as a coach when the 2019 Detroit Pistons are balling out everywhere in these playoffs?  Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown, Luke Kennard, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris (Clippers).  Fucking horrible head coach.  Yeah, I realize it was Markieff and not Marcus on the 2019 Pistons, but Marcus was on the 2017 Pistons who were in the playoffs, too with Fat Van Gundy.  God, that guy sucked."
Clippers for a SnT with Luke Kennard.
"i feel like everybody and their dog have gotten torched by a luke kennard. white dude running around non-stop with a shit haircut hitting every fuckin midranger. annoying as fuck.  joe ingles is that mf dad at the rec literally can't run the length of the court but for some reason you can't get by him, he steals the ball from you with quickest hands you ever seen, and he reads you and your friends like a book on offense. doesn't even look like he's trying, in fact it looks like he's trying to do fancy shit all the time and it's even more annoying"
The new narrative is whether Luke Kennard can supplant Joe Ingles as the dopiest looking dude who will still torch the other team.
Luke Kennard
"Ahyes, the Luke kennard"
Luke Kennard got robbed smh
Make sure that switch is Luke Kennard. Seems like the Clippers are OK with it.
Luke Kennard: ‘what’s that word you said? Dee fence? Tf do that mean?’
For Donovan Mitchell: Luke Kennard  Absolutely shut him down in the second half yesterday
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"Yep, I’m glad you brought it into the mainstream how good Luke Kennard could be. (btw your post is actually cool, jokic is a beast)"
"If Luke Kennard was 8 inches taller with Gerald Green’s athleticism, he’d be the greatest player of all time"
Points scored against Luke Kennard shouldn’t count
"being a great individual defender doesn't matter at all if you're going to give up as soon as there's a screen and let Luke Kennard try to defend your man instead. That may have to do with the Clippers' scheme or with individual effort, but either way, it is the problem."
Probably but if he doesn’t have the trust of the coaching staff it doesn’t matter.   Also I wouldn’t put him on the court if I’m going to have Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard give me something on offense.
I swear Donovan scored 20 straight points on Luke Kennard
"I think pg and Kawhi defense is a little overrated at this point. Not by a ton, but alittle bit. Neither really did anything to slow down luka which is the type of matchup youd expect both to have some level of success.      Don is a tough matchup in his own right and 6'8 wings arent really the type of defender youd want on him. Ty Lue also seems to be running a lot of small ball lineups which are just not good defensively. Zubac was locking down the paint for awhile in the first half. Don got a few to drop but they were tough ones. A lot of small ball in 2nd half with just zero rim protection and Luke kennard out there who was getting targeted relentlessly. Defense got very ugly for the clips and I think that's more on ty Lue than anything else"
"Luke Kennard, Pat Bev expiring, 25th pick and Detroit's 2nd round picks?   How bout it Boston?"
I agree with you. PG needs to play like he did and the role players stepping up. Terrence mann the other day and Luke Kennard today that's a good sign to see
Is luke Kennard a joke to you?!?!
Kemba for Luke Kennard and Marcus Morris?
Yeah as much as Luke Kennard.
Luke Kennard EASILY!
Clippers should trade Luke Kennard and Amir Coffey to New Orleans for Steven Adams. Win-win trade.
"&gt; Players (employees) should do what’s best for them. They don’t owe anything to a billionaire who happened to win a lottery for the rights to the player’s labor for the first half of their career.  Then they should sign with the teams they want to sign with in free agency.  They should accept the qualifying offer that was written into the CBA that the players agreed to that would give them a provision to do precisely that.  This really isn't complicated.   &gt; Employees don’t have a moral obligation to play out their contract with the drafting billionaire just because the billionaires demanded the contract rules give them an advantage to force the employee to work where he doesn’t want to work so as to preserve the owner’s tax write off.  Implying that there is any connection between esoteric IRS depreciation rules and the supermax is flat out one of the dumbest things that anyone has ever written in this subreddit.  edit: I wrote this before reading your argument that the SF VC ecosystem as a draw for players is comparable to Coca-Cola being in Atlanta or oil companies in Texas, incredible.  &gt; The owners are frauds and they set the players against the fans to prevent the simple right of being able to choose where you want to work while maximizing your income.  Pro-labor NBA takes get more atrocious every year.  It's not about 'billionaires', it's about 100M+ net worth superstar athletes negotiating contracts in bad faith, demanding to get traded for pennies on the dollar (frequently trying to tank their value on the way out) and ruining the fan experience of entire cities for the better part of whole decades by doing so (while simultaneously ignoring the fact that a broadly competitive league is in fact a prerequisite for interest in the league, and thereby contracts, to continue growing).   One of the biggest things you miss in your whole screed above is that it's not about superstar players vs billionaires or fans, it's about superstar players versus non-superstar players.  Collective bargaining has resulted in the CBA being much more favorable and oriented in the interests of, say, Luke Kennard, than Damian Lillard.  Mobility for the top 10 superstars in the league -- many of whom don't even want to go anywhere -- is not something that the NBPA uses their negotiating capital on.  If you're mad about this a much more natural place to start would be on rank-and-file NBPA members."
So...are you saying a Luke Kennard-Pat Bev deal isn't going to be enough?
"Luke kennard? If so, no arguing there."
“Derelict my balls Luke Kennard”
"""And if I'm Luke Kennard, I'm a bum."""
"&gt;mid-lower end playoff team in the west  That's the worst place to be in. Not good enough to compete, not bad enough for a good pick. I mean they don't have their own picks but you get the point.   On top of that, between Marcus Morris and Luke Kennard salaries, they aren't getting any good free agents."
Not when Luke kennard and clippers’ Morris got that
PG- Steph Curry SG- CJ McCollum SF- LeBron PF- Luke Kennard C- Larry Nance Jr
Luke Kennard is right there
The Lakers get LA  The clippers get Riverside  Cavs winning a chip tho  Steph CJ LeBron Larry Kosta Koufos  Terry Rozier Gary Trent Jr Luke Kennard Caris Lavert  Admittedly short on post players but nobody is stopping this offense
"The Clippers would beat the Lakers. Pick and roll combo of Rondo and Boogie would be a thing of beauty. Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, and Ibaka on the same team would be scary. There is also Reggie Jackson, Nicolas Batum, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Luke Kennard, and Yogi Ferrell."
"Definitely the Clippers. The starting five of Rondo, PG, Kawhi, Ibaka, and Boogie is scary. Don't forget a prime Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, last year's Luke Kennard, and Yogi Ferrell with the Mavericks."
Ikr? Like imagine if someone drafted Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell lmao. Would be a terrible decision
"Bertans, Luke kennard, THJ, Duncan Robinson..."
and then luke kennard before d mitch lmfao

Im doubling down because I saw him play just about every game last year. Luke Kennard is not a guy you want creating offense for others or running multiple iso's a game. Taking one to two dribbles after a pump fake isn't exactly being a great shot creator.

"&gt;Did Clippers win any this season?  Did I say they did? It was argued they were cursed so I pointed out that Lakers are the same.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Is Kawhi going to re-sign?   I'd put it at roughly a 95% chance. It simply makes too much sense.  1) Kawhi wants to be the top dog. He wants to be the leader, whether we think he can be or not. If he goes to say, the Lakers, or the Warriors or the Heat, or potentially the Mavs, he either might not be the best player or he might not be the leader of the team.  &amp;#x200B;  2) Kawhi wants to be with his family. This is easily the most pressing and important reason. He left the title winners who loved him, where he was the best player but not the leader, in a culture that embraced him, and after winning another FMVP to go to LA. Why? Because some things are more important than Basketball, family being one of them. He wants to be with his family.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Kawhi wants to be in LA. This is shown by him integrating himself into the LA culture and marketing/advertising/promoting himself in a way to make himself seem like a pure LA player.  &amp;#x200B;  4) Kawhi would have chosen the Lakers already if he wanted to go there. He didn't, because this ties into reason 1. He wants to be the leader and the top dog, and he probably wants to be the underdog.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;How are the Clippers going to swing a trade with their cap space and their lack of assets?   Unless a superstar trade happens, Clippers are and should be favoured to come out of the West next year.  I don't want to go on a tirade about why, I think you are reasonable enough to agree, but changes like Ty Lue over Doc, PG13 rising up, taking the Suns to 6 without Kawhi, overcoming the doubters and haters and finally gaining an identity, roleplayers stepping up, extremely attractive FA destination already and becomes even more appealing, ect ect.  In terms of youth, Lebron is 36, will be 37 this year, turning 38 next year and AD will be 29. Both are or are becoming injury prone. The Lakers roster is an absolute mess right now and a LOT of changes need to happen, going by Lakers fans and outsider fans. Their best and only valuable asset is THT, who has potential but not an All Star ceiling.  Kawhi is 30, turning 31 next year and is injury prone. Paul George is 31, turning 32 next year and is not injury prone. The Clippers roster is strong but smart moves need to be made in signings and keeping key pieces while having to let go of others and replace them. They have a very promising young talent in Mann who dropped 40 in the playoffs as a piece for the future and for potential trades.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Or do you think Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and 1 draft pick in 7 years later is enough to get Dame?  I don't know if it is and I don't think it matters. Clippers will make a call to the Blazers for Dame offers, negotiate a bit, test the water to see the value of some assets and hang the phone up eventually. They don't need Dame like the Lakers ""need"" Dame. Only way Dame even goes to LA is if he says ""I will not play in your team unless you trade me to the Los Angeles Lakers."" You think Dame does that?"
"OK, Sorry. Let's talk about the present then. Did Clippers win any this season? Is Kawhi going to re-sign? How are the Clippers going to swing a trade with their cap space and their lack of assets? Or do you think Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and 1 draft pick in 7 years later is enough to get Dame?"
"Can't believe he is only a career .350 three point shooter. There were some games where he couldn't miss from downtown. If he could have just gotten a more reliable 3 shot, near .400 shooting, he'd be living large on a Luke Kennard type contract instead of washing out of the league."
"The Hawks somehow always get absolutely fucked by the most random players imaginable, Bobby Portis joining the club with Luke Kennard and Shake Milton"
"Really not a whole lot the Clippers can do. However, this team will always be in contention as long as Kawhi and PG are on the team.   Sucks that Reggie is gonna leave (and probably Batum), but if Mann keeps improving, Kennard actually takes a step forward, and they draft well at #25 this year, this window will be open for at least another 2-5 years.   I could see them maybe trying to package Morris and Kennard in a trade and get a proven verteren (Lowry), but I think Jerry and co are still pretty high on Luke."
Luke Kennard will be better next year. They need him to step up with Reggie gone and he will.
Luke Kennard lmao
Dennis Schroeder was just getting paid 15.5m from LA this past season. Reggie Jackson is a very similar player so his deal should be in that ball park on a 2-3 year deal. Luke Kennard is currently on a 3 year 41m dollar deal. Lol Reggie WILL be making more than that
"As you mentioned, Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum may be gone and if that's the case then they're kind of fucked (more with the Batum thing - I don't think there's another bargain-bin wing available that can replace his production).   I'd love to see Rubio on the team but he's slightly overpaid enough to the point where it's hard for the Clippers to salary match unless the Wolves want Luke Kennard or something (maybe there's a 3-team trade somewhere).  I still kind of think they should go with a budget playmaker. If they can't retain Reggie Jackson, I literally think they should go for a PatBev/Eric Bledsoe swap and sign Elfrid Payton to a vet min. The issue with both of those guys though is that it kills their 5-out spacing when they go small (but hell they might already lose that if Reggie and Batum walk)."
I know it’s over but Luke Kennard sucks and should stop shooting
Luke Kennard is so fucking bad holy moly
Also Luke Kennard is fucking terrible. Like actually not NBA quality. I swear every time someone isos him it’s an instant buck.
I read this really quickly and I thought Luke Kennard and Nic Batum were involved in the fight in the stands
Luke Kennard about to go off
Luke Kennard doing Ben Simmons things in the 1st half
every team would like a Pat Beverly on their team than a Luke Kennard
Lmao Luke Kennard is fucking dog shit
Luke Kennard is prime shitting in this game
Luke Kennard has been absolutely horrific this game
"I cant stand how passive Luke Kennard is. He gets the ball, passes it back, and then motions for the ball back when its too late. He does this like every single time he touches the ball.   When he shoots 3's he is fun to watch but his head isnt on right most of the time."
"These playoffs are ass  Im watching cameron payne, luke kennard, jae crowder, terrance mann, and abdel nader in the fucking conference finals."
"Do we get a Luke ""the nard dog"" Kennard game tonight?"
Tyler “The Black Luke Kennard’ Herro
"MJ, Caruso, Luke Kennard, Trae, Stephen A Smith"
Disrespectful to Luke “no fluke” Kennard
Did Luke Kennard get hurt?
"trading away luke kennard and bruce brown during the draft, then trading d rose for peanuts and buying Blake out of his contract"
you misspelled Luke Kennard and Luke Kennard
"No way. I like PG, but none of the rest of the clippers aside from Mann are even remotely likeable  Beverly has purposely hurt players  Morris is a hot head who’s nowhere near the player of Bookers caliber  Zubac despite being an incredibly aggressive player complains any time he’s rightfully called for a foul  Boogie is legit a crazy person, whos said some really fucked up shit  Luke Kennard played at Duke"
"luke kennard   shot is so beautiful, looks like theres 0 room for error"
It’s not Mozgov/Deng territory. Maybe a Luke Kennard situation.
"You forget Clippers legend Luke ""Luka Nard"" Kennard"
Lol he will probably get a lot more than what Herro gets. I think Herro is worth what Luke Kennard gets.
"Imagine having Jackson on a minimum, meanwhile Luke ""64 million"" Kennard goes for an impressive 0/1/1/1 in 20 mins"
[He did the M. Bison slide into Luke’s legs last game. He’s definitely going to hit him in the KenNARDS next game](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/luke-kennard-one-vs-phoenix-041200029.html)
They do have Luke Kennard though.
people fail to realize that clippers small ball is still big mobile guys. shit even luke kennard is 6'6
Luke Kennard and MPJ
Terrence Mann and Luke Kennard are going crazy in game 6.
Luke Kennard has been an absolute zero this series
Luke kennard. The nard dog?
Luke Kennard is on Ayton...throw him the ball maybe? LOL
You have Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson guarding Ayton and you chuck up a contested 3 what are you doing rn
Have you ever actually seen Luke Kennard hit a shot
I don’t think Ive ever seen Luke Kennard hit a shot.
The Clips need a Luke Kennard 40 bomb that everyone deep down knows he has in him.  He just needs to channel his inner Shep Sheppard.
&gt; Although Kennard got $16 million per year so who knows…  thanks for giving me an excuse to break out my Kennard copy pasta  😁  Luke Kennard's extension  * '22 $12.7 mil base salary + $1.2 mil reachable incentives * '23 $13.7 mil base salary + $1.2 mil reachable incentives * '24 $14.8 mil base salary + $1.2 mil reachable incentives * '25 team option  expected average value $14.9 mil per year
Luke Kennard
Okay but injured players sit with the team all the time. I doubt the org is keeping him out on the off chance Shaq jumps into the stand and in an effort to escape Kawhi retears his acl. I don’t even think there’s ever been an instant of an injury occurring to a player on the bench from this.   The response that he doesn’t need to be there bc he’s not a vocal leader is more of an indictment of him than anything. A top 5 player can’t even sit on the bench and yell “screen coming” at Luke Kennard in the teams first western conference finals? That’s supposed to be an okay thing?
Yes. At the time. Eric Gordon was seen as a future all star. Maybe a Shai Gilgegous Level or Jamal Murray. Al Farooq was a young athlete and Kaman a solid vet former all star on an expiring.  The Lakers deal had Lamar who was a role player. Albeit a cool notable one. Scola. A solid role player. Kevin Martin who was maybe at best Jordan Clarkson level guy....and Dragic who was maybe thought of like Luke Kennard at the time. Eric Gordon and Al Farooq seemed like way higher potential players.
Lmao there is almost nothing Ty lue wants less than to give garbage man luke kennard any playing time
Luke Kennard is the Clippers Kyle Kuzma
It's probably pretty hard for the media and sportscasters to sell the general public on milquetoast Luke Kennard stepping up.
Luke kennard has never seen a shot he doesnt like
Luke Kennard on Ayton. It’s happening tonight
"&gt; Dame is out. Enjoy watching Patrick Beverley, Marcus Morris, and Luke Kennard the next 2 seasons  I agree"
The disrespect to Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard
I like him but Trae is easily better than Luke Kennard.
This is like saying Luke kennard is bad at defense so Luka obviously would go off. Did u watch a single second of that series lmao Seth was never guarding him holy shit you’re a moron.
Luke Kennard about to do it this year
Luke kennard
Luke Kennard
There was a Luke Kennard “Nard Dog” one and this one about either Toronto or Detroit winning a game and some kid basically saying his life was shit with a lot of “hell yeah!” thrown in.  Sadly I don’t got that phone anymore and it ain’t saved😭
"Blake, meet your second option: The Nard Dog, sharpshooter for hire with the slickest pump fake in the game. Move over Korver. Move over Reddick. Move over even JOE INGLES. There’s a new white shooter in town and his name is Luke Douglas Kennard, 6’5 and 206 pounds. Watch him post up Deandre Jordan for the one handed slam and the stank face. Watch him date the daughter from Chrisley Knows Best. In 20 years Luke is going to be the second athlete to build a school like LBJ did in Akron. Nard University. Detroit will rebound on a dime as students pour in from across the world. Donovan Mitchell’s pitiful career will pale in comparison, and SVG’s true drafting prowess will be fully revealed."
"Grand Rapids Drive (partially owned by Ben Wallace) didn't want to move to the east side of the state, so the Pistons started a new G League team closer to home, and the Drive (now gold) got picked up by Denver.  As a Grand Rapidian, I am bummed my team won't be playing 15 mins from my house, but I'm glad they're still G League affiliated.   Luke Kennard is probably the best player I saw play with The Drive, but he was far and away the best player on the court.   R.I.P. Hasheem Thabeet's career"
"I get that he's an amazing shooter in part because it's unblockable due to his height, just like KD, and is certainly one of the best in the league, but generational? Why?   What defines a generation? Joe Harris was drafted in 2014, Luke Kennard shot a higher percentage on 3.8/game vs 4.6 for MPJ and was taken in 2017.   Trae shoots a poor percentage because of how deep he shoots. Only Curry and Dame can shoot at an elite percentage from that range. MPJ doesn't have to create his own 3 point attempts and would struggle to do so because he has a bad handle."
"Every Piston fan back then thought we were getting Melo. I remember everytime Melo had a big game we was like what did Darko do, oh yeah, nothing.  I loved Tay though, idk how we would’ve made it fit but I would’ve loved Melo here.  That’s why I’m scared this year. Cade is the obvious pick but I love Jalen Green.  I hope we didn’t mess up another draft.  Still not over Luke Kennard over Mitchell, when we projected to take Mitchell"
"Even if Simmons holds out, that isn’t going to take his value lower than the McCollums / Brogdons of the world.  I know this sub is delusional about his value, but he’s not going for a Luke Kennard type package.  There is no chance"
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
Luke Kennard would eat you alive defensively. You wouldn’t be able to dribble twice before he strips it from you
"Luke Kennard, worst defender I have ever seen."
"lol Jazz fans always blame the guards for Gobert being soft  dude has Luke Kennard switched on him and doesn't even try to establish position so how are his guards gonna pass him the ball? and Gobert's FG% drops off a cliff beyond 3 feet to under 30% cause he has zero touch in the paint. if it's not a wide open dunk or if he's expected to take even one dribble, it's a disaster"
"Luke Kennard, NAW come to mind off the top of my head"
Please take Luke Kennard!!!!
and Luke Kennard lmao
"&gt; Extending on your second thing, a bunch of teams are incredibly stupid for not signing Schroeder for pennies on the dollar. He is making less than half as much money as Luke Kennard this year.  Tbf This was a popular opinion in the “Celtics are interested in Schroeder” and “The Celtics signed Schroeder” threads."
&gt;He is making less than half as much money as Luke Kennard this year.  all the while being a much better player. That is a fantastic point.
"Extending on your second thing, a bunch of teams are incredibly stupid for not signing Schroeder for pennies on the dollar. He is making less than half as much money as Luke Kennard this year.  &gt; Everybody even the most anti analytics people use stats in some capacity  ""Hooper"" people fucking WORSHIP box score numbers. Cannot even count the amount of times I've seen ""basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet"" and ""how can you think a guy who averages _____ isn't that good"" from the same people, often at the same time."
"If you think those teams are worse, then get off this sub. How is Fred not better than Pat Bev and Luke Kennard who barely got minutes in the playoffs 😂😂  The sixers had to play tyrese Maxey instead of Ben for stretches because of how shitty he was on offence. You don’t think that having Fred instead would make them better 😂  KP was a massive defensive liability, did jack shit on offence, and provided no value as a big. Fred alleviates their issues with creation outside of Luka.  If the raptors wouldn’t make that trade with Denver even though the money is equivalent, then that means FVV is on a Relatively good contract 😂😂😂😂😂"
"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
Paul George and Luke Kennard Clippers are 7th in the league???
"replace 'man' with 'Steve Ballmer', 'promise land' with 'Luke Kennard'"
"Mate, they took Stanley Johnson ahead of Devin Booker, Henry Ellenson ahead of Caris LeVert and Pascal Siakam and Luke Kennard ahead of Mitchell and Adebayo.   That's three straight where they made picks that were obviously the wrong decision in a row. That's why the problem is scouting."
He’d just be Luke Kennard
"I used the fanspo, ESPN’s trade machine has sucked for a while. Doing the deal with Morris, which the Rockets would probably prefer, works as is. Doing the deal with Luke Kennard in place of Morris requires Yogi Ferrell to be added to the deal.   Here’s the deal: https://i.imgur.com/jfyizZm.jpg"
what about luke kennard
Luke Kennard spotting
Would there be some way to trade Eric Gordon and John Wall to the Clippers for short and/or cheap contracts?   John Wall + Eric Gordon   For   Rajon Rondo + Patrick Beverly + Marcus Morris (or Luke Kennard)   Surprisingly works in the trade machine. Would the Rockets want to just dump Wall’s and Gordon’s salary? I don’t know enough about how Gordon played.
Damn if you’re this possessive about Luke Kennard you must’ve been fucking bawling when SGA got traded
"What? You don’t think teams will want Luke Kennard, Morris and Bev? /s"
No one wants Luke Kennard and Zubac Bro
Luke Kennard and a pick if we’ve got any.
"What assets are they going to use to pull in Siakam? Once they give Kawhi his payday, they are going to be capped out between like 4 players (Leonard, George, Morris, Beverly) and they don't have any draft picks until like 2030.   Siakam is due $33M this year, and the Raptors could do a lot better than Morris, Bev, or Luke fucking Kennard."
But come on anytime you can pay Luke Kennard 16m a year you do it right?
"As a Pistons fan, Pistons fans are...really not good at evaluating talent.  Our sub spent years hyping up Luke Kennard as an elite shooter who was unquestionably the sort of guy who'd be the second-best player on a championship team. ""I wouldn't take two firsts for Luke Kennard, straight up."" That sort of thing.  We can, uh, see how that turned out."
"Clippers struggled because they didn't realize how much stock they should have put in Reggie Jackson's shooting ability and then when they did Kawhi got injured. I don't see them making that mistake next year. The young players (Terrance Mann, Luke Kennard, Ivac Zubac) will play with much more confidence next playoffs. If Kawhi looks healthy (not a great chance I do agree) I see them beating most teams in the West. People sleep on Clippers too much and they not even my team."
"I think Clippers was the deepest team last year. I don’t know about this year but they are looking good.   Pg: Reggie Jackson, Pet Bav, Preston, Rondo   Sg: Paul George, Luke Kennard, Keon   Sf: Kawhi, Mann, Justise   Pf: Batum, Marcus Morris  C: Zubac, Ibaka, DC"
Luke Kennard did a fine job
Could you imagine if this team had Kennard. The Luke - KD combo would be insane
"Right, I'm not disagreeing with any of this, but my point was that these are dudes who are getting memed on. It would be much more conclusive if the sub just stanned a bunch of random white role players without any personality or funny memes - which I dont see happening. For instance I have never seen people overblow the talents of a guys like DiVincenzo or Luke Kennard.   On the other side of the coin, Lowry and Butler get a ton more attention on this sub than other similarly skilled all stars because they have the personalities and memes to keep an internet forum interested."
&gt;as well as Luke Kennard  I was so sure he was getting traded this offseason.
I'm very high on Luke Kennard. I think he has not only the potential to be an elite sharpshooter (if he isn't already) but also to create a little bit for others and become a 3-level scorer.
Luke Kennard
"They dont need to send back anything amazing, Luke Kennard and a 2nd would likely be enough.  They key is not taking back a bad contract for free like Dwight Powell."
"5 imaginary picks, Morris, Luke Kennard , pat bev"
"5 imaginary picks, Luke Kennard and pat bev"
cause Gobert is taller and makes $40m/year. is it too much to ask to score over Luke Kennard and not airball wide open layups?
"the following players are all better than any of your roleplayers, in most cases significantly:  * Nic Batum  * Marcus Morris  * Ivica Zubac  * Yes, Serge Ibaka  * Reggie Jackson (if he re-signs)  The following players are at least as good as any of your roleplayers:  * Terance Mann  * Luke Kennard  In general, not only do we have shooters at least as good as yours, but unlike you, ours can also defend."
Lol they have an overpaid Morris and Luke fucking Kennard rofl
I was terrified that it'd be something centered around Luke Kennard and/or PatBev.
Very easy choice. Luke Kennard is going to kill it at center next year.
Pop not interested in a slightly used Luke kennard?
Spurs get to choose between Lauri Markannen or Luke Kennard.
Luke Kennard next Vinny Del Negro
Playoff P and luke kennard are spooky you guys might be pretty good one day
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
"Cus Spurs always have good role players. Lol pistons were terrible this past decade but so many of our ex-players contributed in the playoffs this year. Reggie Jackson, Blake griffin, Bruce brown, luke kennard, Andre Drummond (kinda), KCP, Derrick rose, Reggie bullock."
He’s getting significantly more than luke Kennard whether you believe it or not.
"wow, that's almost Luke Kennard money"
"5 role players for DeRozan is a pretty gross mischaracterization of the total of the situation.  (1) Batum is retainable no one is giving him more than a minimum.   (2) Rondo was in the rotation for the Dallas series exclusively. He was a trade deadline move that ultimately didn't work in Lue's offensive scheme. The likelihood he gets bought out or salary dumped before the new league year isn't 0 anyways.  (3) Thinking about the Spurs why do they take Beverley back and why does DeRozan agree to a S&amp;T giving money back if the team receiving him is gutted of good playoff role players? Bev's an older expiring and the only way he goes to SA is if he's being immediately rerouted to another contender with draft capital (spoiler: there aren't many of those, and they probably don't want Bev anyways). I doubt a team with 5 guards and no size wants to acquire another undersized guard. The S&amp;T would probably be any 2 of Morris, Kennard or Mann for DeRozan to sign him ~18-20 million.   (4) If we're bringing in DeRozan it's because we've decided he should replace Reggie as a ballhandler and are okay with that loss.  Worse case scenario the actual losses of this move would be Morris, Mann, and Reggie. Best case we keep Mann and get DeRozan to sign at a net of less money than the Morris+Kennard contracts so we still have our TPMLE. Now tell me how much sleep you lose at night if all you give up for an efficient 20 ppg scorer and distributor is Marcus Morris, Luke Kennard, and Reggie Jackson. Reggie and Morris are good pieces but if you get an all star caliber scorer back you take that."
"Luke Kennard, Zubac and some second rounders I think."
"Spurs, may we interest you in a slightly used Luke Kennard?"
"**Colby White** \- when he's moved off of PG and can just focus on his game as a scoring guard, I think he will surprise some folks.  **Collin Sexton** \- not 'given up' on, persay. People know he's talented. I think he'll be on the up and up though.  **Obi Toppin** \- I know he's a little raw right now, but he's athletic as hell and with a little more development time could be a very solid player.  **James Wiseman** \- bigs take long to develop. He's a raw prospect, he gotta brew. Has a lot of physical tools though. And even as a raw prospect, I've seen him drain threes and go coast-to-coast.  Other sleeper possibilities: Marvin Bagley, Luke Kennard."
luke kennard is better than bobby
***Luke Kennard laughs**
"Dont forget Luke Kennard right before D Mitchell. And the sleeper bullshit, the one good pick he made - Spencer Dinwiddie in the 2nd round, he immediately gave up on quick and shipped out for nothing."
Can I interest you in a slightly used Luke Kennard
Maybe they ought to trade for  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
"If they don’t bring them back, then they have zero chance of bringing back:  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac"

They should bring back  Nicolas Batum  Patrick Beverley  Amir Coffey  DeMarcus Cousins  Yogi Ferrell  Paul George  Serge Ibaka  Reggie Jackson  Keon Johnson  Luke Kennard  Kawhi Leonard  Terance Mann  Marcus Morris Sr.  Daniel Oturu  Patrick Patterson  Jason Preston  Rajon Rondo  Jay Scrubb  Ivica Zubac
I don’t want him for no more than Luke Kennard money
Trading Luke Kennard for Saddiq Bey will go down as an all timer for us lol
"Suns wanted Luke Kennard during the trade deadline of 19-20 for added shooting off the bench. I think they get the shooting they desired at a lower price, so good move for the Suns with that in mind."
"Hayes and Cade were your own picks right? Grant was with cap space.   The only two flipped assets were Luke Kennard and Christian Wood. The Kennard trade was great for the Pistons. Wood is really good though, and I think that was a lot to give up."
"For all the wailing Pistons fans do about missed draft picks, Mitchell is about the only one that sure fire felt AWFUL in the moment. And Luke Kennard is a good player, but I just remember the live chat getting so damn pumped that Mitchell fell to us and then so outraged at the Kennard pick. A bad day to be sure."
"They traded him for all rookie 1st team Saddiq Bey…   Well, really it was Luke Kennard and Brown for that pick but they had to get the Nets involved to dump Kennard’s expiring.   Either way, they weren’t going to re-sign either of them so why keep them when you could get a player you like in the draft?"
"That doesn't matter, you still missed out on him whether you were going to pick him or not. Just like how the Pistons missed out because they valued Luke Kennard higher"
God I wish I could block luke kennard out of my brain like I did those two jabronis they signed to big contracts right after Chauncey got traded and Ben left.  Edit: a word
Did you mean Luke Kennard?
i’d rather take cade and regret it later than see him be good somewhere else.  please. i’ve watched us fumble pick after pick. we coulda had giannis one year but he was such a project and from another country im not going to include him.  recently   2013 we took kcp and coulda had CJ Mccollum  2014 no pick  2015 stanley johnson over myles turner and booker  2016 ellenson. coulda had lavert but this is outside the lottery so im not trippin  2017 this is the one that makes me want to blow my brains out. luke fucking kennard over donovan mitchell. (also coulda got bam)  2018 no pick  2019 dekou he’s a bust but was outside the lottery and no other pick was really worthwhile after besides thybulle and kpj.  please for the love of god just take cade.
"If he lead his team to 82-0 , I'll give him a slight edge over Reggie Jackson.  But I'll believe  Luke kennard will be the mvp"
Luke Kennard
"&gt;He’s a great 8th guy. Imagine the hawks or clippers had him coming in for them at the bottom of their rotation?  He'd be like the 9-10th guy on a healthy Clippers team. He wouldn't be ahead of Zubac, Morris/Batum or Reggie. He probably shouldn't be ahead of Mann either, since Mann does stuff that Kuz doesn't - and whatever Kuz does, Morris does better.  And the Clippers already have an overpaid 10th man in Luke Kennard, why would they want another?"
"No offense but Pistons had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, but they consistently drafted terribly with picks like Stanley Johnson over Booker and Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell among many others. I trust that the Spurs could find a star in the mid first round eventually."
Clippers trade luke kennard and a first for Giannis (I know it’s not happening)
Luke Kennard and a 2028 2nd
"Crazy trade idea, but I kinda like it?  3-wat trade with Philly, Houston, and LA.  Rockets: Ben Simmons, Luke Kennard, Keon Johnson. 76ers: Eric Gordon, Eric Bledsoe, and Serge Ibaka Clippers: John Wall, Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, and Usman Garuba.  Rotations for each team still work pretty well imo, and the teams are trading problems for only potential problems. The salaries of these guys make then almost impossible to trade, so maybe these guys all get traded together.  Philly and LA may get a pick or two as well."
"Do any of those teams have a 2x.Ohio.Mr. Basketball winner on their team?  No, cause they don't have Luke Kennard. Daryl Morey, we await your call."
I thought he was going to the Nets for sure. Great career considering the college hype and never being very athletic. I thought it was a troll by him when I saw this on YouTube a few minutes ago.  Good luck JJ… Luke Kennard must carry the Duke shooter elite mantle now
"How I’ve felt with some of the former pistons  Happy for Blake, Reggie, the Morris Twins, Bobi and Tobi, the ghost of Luke Kennard, DRose, along with Bruce Bruce Brown and Christian wood  Except Andre, fuck andre"
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tomáš Satoranský / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
Damn luke kennard going wild
"The Clippers are gonna open that thing just in time to coincide with the post Kawhi, post PG era where they're being led by Luke Kennard 😂"
Um... why? I would rather have Luke Kennard than John Wall's fat ass contract on a rebuilding team
What would they even trade to match salaries?  Luke Kennard + Morris?
"Idk if you’ve seen wall play but other than when he was tanking (which was a big stretch this season) or hurt (which is also a big concern) he’s a legit star. Easily an all star. Ibaka’s back is toast, Bledsoe is Bledsoe and Luke Kennard brings minimal value to the team. It’s really a gamble on health, but with stacked teams like Nets and Lakers that’s a gamble you need to take if you want to win championships."
"Trade him for salary filler. Serge Ibaka, Eric Bledsoe, and Luke Kennard basically matches salaries while still clearly making the clippers a better team. Then ask for like, a mf second round pick."
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
"he was inconsistent on a tanking team, he was good at times. bledsoe is not better, but luke kennard might be. i’m not sure about moving kennard, i think it comes down to if you think the highs are worth it. it’s not the worst idea but i’m not sure if it’s a good one"
Reggie Jackson   Luke Kennard   Paul George  Marcus Morris  Ivica Zubac   That’s not getting you a top 6 seed in the west buddy. That’s the 2017 Detroit Pistons backcourt.
I want Luke Kennard to do well.  I don't know if he'll ever develop the type of irrational confidence that could take his game to the next level though.  He should be taking 30 foot bombs off the dribble at least 5 times a game.  Instead he pulls down an open jumper if a defender is within 10 feet him.
"You're not understanding my point. The fact that the best thing on offense you can give Gobert is how well he sets his screens is pitiful. If you're a 7'2 center (not even counting the fact that he's on a max contract), you should be able to back down a 6'9 Morris, Paul George, Batum, and even 6'4 Reggie Jackson/Luke Kennard instead of relying on your guards to create something for you when you're looking to grab a bucket. You don't think Lebron, KD, and Shaq all disrespect Gobert for a reason?"
Luke Kennard
"East: 1. Bucks- consistently great regular season team under Bud, don’t see that changing. They were right in the mix last year even though they had that one horrid stretch where Jrue/Khris were both out.  2. Hawks- bold take, I know, but they were on 56-win pace with Nate in charge and Hunter missed most of the season. They’re insanely deep and should be a good regular season team.  3. Nets- they’re the best team in the East IMO, just don’t see them killing the regular season due to lack of depth and resting Harden/KD/Kyrie.  4. Heat- they played well with Jimmy last year, and Lowry is a nice add. They got better without giving up much.  5. 76ers- think they’re a good team, but the Simmons absence/inevitable trade make them worse than last year. Also don’t count on Embiid staying healthy, and Drummond’s a bad add.  6. Pacers- they were a solid playoff team before Bjorkgren, and I think they’ll bounce back with Carlisle. I also rate Duarte as a draft pickup.   7. Celtics- think other teams did more to get better, they’re probably better than last year but just got leapfrogged.   8. Knicks- let’s be honest, they overperformed expectations last year. I think the Celtics/Pacers/Heat/Hawks all got better and had less go wrong last year than the Knicks.   West: 1. Jazz- proven regular season team, Mitchell should get better and I like Paschall and Gay as bench adds.   2. Nuggets- I love the jump Jokic took last year, and I think Murray comes back 100%- ACL isn’t the killer it once was. They were the four seed even with Murray and half a year of Gordon, and Jeff Green is a solid bench add.  3. Suns- I think they fall back a bit, but they were still an elite team in the regular season last year, and hopefully they go to Ayton more in the regular season.  4. Clippers- I think the Clippers are being way underrated, and I think their non-Kawhi run last year wasn’t a mirage. PG can be that guy on a playoff team, but with Kawhi he’s been more of an overqualified Robin. Lue is a good coach who has good rotations, and the Clippers have a fairly deep squad. They didn’t get the most out of Luke Kennard last year, and they’ll hope Terrance Mann can be the guy he was in the playoffs.   5. Warriors- Klay being back is good, but two years off won’t help him. They’re still a thin team, maybe their young guys grow a bit and help them but I don’t think they’re title contenders. What I like about them is how good the defense was down the stretch, Kerr really got the most out of them defensively.   6. Blazers- we know what they are, great regular season team. Think they’re about as good with Billups as with Stotts, but not much better.   7. Lakers- controversial, I know. But I just have serious issues with this team’s roster construction. Russ has been pretty wildly inconsistent the past two regular seasons, and there are injury concerns with all three of Russ/Bron/AD. Who can you really count on from the bench? It’s a bunch of old guys who are 15-20 MPG players but the Lakers will want more. The defense will take a huge step back with these additions, and I don’t have a ton of faith in their bench offense; it’s just Monk/Nunn/Melo.  8. Timberwolves- the D’Lo/Ant/KAT lineups have been really offensively potent, Finch is a good coach, and I think teams like the Grizzlies/Spurs took a step back."
I’ll never forget what Luke fucking Kennard did to us
"Trying to think of teams that could really use Rubio, and what they could potentially trade for him and his $17.8m contract; remembering the Cavs largely need wing depth:   **Boston Celtics:** Would have to be some combination of Richardson and Nesmith/Langford.   **Los Angeles Clippers:** Luke Kennard and maybe Keon Johnson?   **New Orleans Pelicans:** Josh Hart and maybe Trey Murphy?   Hard to find much of a market for him where the other team can give up much."
High on Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard would be a hall of famer if he was an average defender
Luke Kennard average defense is a ball of famer
"Lmfao Pelicans contending? Hornets? Why would they trade for Dragic?   Lakers with who? They trading 12 of their minimum contracts for one Dragic?   Hawks with who? They trading their promising rookies for old Dragic? 😂  Celtics with who? They trading Marcus Smart for Dragic? Horford for Dragic?   Jazz with who? Conley for Dragic? Ingles for Dragic? Boggy for Dragic? Jordan Clarkson for Dragic? lmfao  Clippers with who? Marcus Morris? Maybe they’ll trade Kawhi for Dragic 😂 or maybe Raptors take Bledsoe for Dragic right? 😂 or Luke Kennard lmao  Look at those teams and they don’t have any guys that would match up to trade for Dragic without giving up contributing players / promising rookies  Again, you sound stupid."
Gobert throwing away 4 possessions won them that game?  yea we saw what happened in G6. Gobert didn't even attempt to postup Luke Kennard or Reggie. he don't want the ball cause he know he can't score inside  lmao it's hilarious how Donovan gets blame cause Gobert can't finish an open layup
"It’s a mild overpay, but not a crazy one. People just aren’t used to the new salary numbers. There’s no way that Gordon would get $15 Million nowadays. In today’s market, that’s the salary of a bench player. Any average starter is nowadays is getting $17-$22 Million at least.   All contending teams have to overpay to keep their players, because their already over the cap and agents know that these teams have too much to lose by letting a guy walk. It doesn’t even have to do with big vs small markets. The Clippers are in LA, and they had to give Marcus Morris a $65 Million dollar contract and Luke Kennard a $41 Million dollar contract last year."
do the Pistons always have a Luke Kennard looking dude on the roster?
"Yeah, but I probably take Markelle and Lauri over Luke Kennard"
Detroit recouping the picks they lost in the Luke Kennard trade
Why the fuck is Luke Kennard 7th lmao
"I'm not a nuggets fan and I wouldn't necessarily agree. I would reserve the ""terrible"" as descriptor for guys like Trae Young or Luke Kennard etc.  In fact I don't think I could argue for any center with minutes to be terrible at defense currently. Even guys like Enes Kanter or Jeff Green are somewhere from slighly negative to clear negatives.  With that in mind I don't really get why it's so impossible to argue for Jokic to being between slightly positive to neutral player on defense. I'm not even quite sure if he's in bottom 10 centers last season and I'd guess that there are less than 10 centers with decent minutes who actually were even negatives of defense."
"From what I gather this is the opinion of a random nba scout who spoke to ryan russillo. But even then there is no link to the original source at all and the entire article seems to just aggregate what was said which makes me a bit suspicious. If it’s convincing enough to you then cool but to me id like to see this from a legit sixers insider who’s actually reporting on the situation( or even a link to the original source if the article you posted) I don’t think thats a huge ask and if you can give me that ill definitely reconsider my position on Simmons   I saw Rudy Gobert pass up wide open dunks before and being completely unable to post up Luke Kennard. That doesn’t mean he’s not a hard worker, it just means he makes mistakes and lacks skill   J’avale looking like KD in practice has nothing to do with intelligence, its highlighting the dramatic difference between playing on a practice court vs an nba court. Everyone knows Javale would never be able to do that stuff on an actual court  I saw footage of Ben Simmons knocking down 3s like nothing during practice, [hell i found this on YouTube ](https://youtu.be/6ZKor0eb2Oc)   Obviously it doesn’t mean anything because off season practice never do. My point was to say that just because you see a person being bad at something on the basketball court doesn’t mean they don’t work hard on it. Sometimes we just gotta accept that certain players are straight bad at some things and will never be good at them, Ben Simmons shot can never be fixed but I think his offensive agression and confidence can be fixed under the right guidance. Thats why he gotta get a fresh start somewhere else  My pushback is based on the idea that fans are too easily susceptible to confirmation bias, like i said if you can give me a legitimate source that Ben Simmons doesn’t work hard then ill admit im wrong about him but unless you can it feels that the whole “ Ben Simmons doesn’t work hard” thing seems to be based on faulty reporting and nba media pushing narratives. Even intuitively, saying that a DPOY candidate/All star doesn’t work hard is kind of crazy to hear  Again if you can provide a legitimate source from a sixers insider or any credible reporter with a good track record or provide the link to the original report from the article so i can hear directly what was said then ill legitimately consider changing my mind. I have no problem admitting Simmons isn’t a hard worker if im getting that info from a legit source"
"Really? I’m salty over an irrelevant signing? Couldn’t give less of a fuck about Rondo.   If playoff Rondo was nonexistent on a team that made the WCF and couldn’t beat out a 2nd year player or Luke Kennard for minutes, why is he suddenly going to revitalize himself now?   He won’t play when it matters and you and I both know it."
"Luke Kennard, Zubac, &amp; Embiid can borrow Kawhi's good knee till he gets back"
"Hear me out .. Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris and Terrance Mann for Simmons?   How could you say no to that?   We can even throw in Eric Bledsoe    You don't like that ..  hear me out   Buddy hield, Marvin bagely, and a bag of chips    You don't like that hear me out .... draymond green straight up   Lol"
"Luke Kennard, fifth highest paid player on the Clippers.  He's going to need to play like a real rotation player."
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
"The bigger problem is philly wants to compete so it is much harder trading him since they don't want expiring contracts and picks.  The Nets, Warriors and Clippers all would be very willing to pay his salary as 3rd/4th option. Luke Kennard + Bledsoe or DeAndre + Joe Harris would all be immediately done from their side but that philly would not want ofc."
it's hilarious how Jazz fans blame Donovan cause Gobert can't post up Luke Kennard
There was a stretch in I think Game 1 or 2 against the Suns where both Boogie and Luke Kennard entered the game and super charged both team offense
Terance Mann and Luke Kennard will both average more than 10 ppg this season.
Jazz fans out here talking about how Gobert is better than Donovan Mitchell when Gobert couldn't post up Luke Kennard lmao
"Clippers signing Luke Kennard for 4 years, $64M"
Luke Kennard
It's definitely ^^not Luke Kennard
"I think MPJ might be have the best odds with a more expanded offensive role.  My out-there pick would be Luke Kennard, with a more low pressure regular season he may be able to showcase his shooting and playmaking ability."
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
Gobert couldn't post up Luke Kennard if his playoff hopes depended on it
How could they possibly think that when he is in the company of great players such as Luke Kennard and Malik Monk.
Is Luke kennard the black Dame Lillard?

Is Luke kennard the black Dame Lillard?
"Luke ""worst contract in the NBA"" Kennard"
Luke “Stephen Curry” Kennard
We're missing open shots and Luke Kennard has 13. We're not playing bad ball.
Luke Kennard confuses me. If I shoot like that guy I’m telling coach I’m shooting 10 3’s a game.
Luke kennard leading scorer of game lol
Luke Kennard vs Anfernee Simons
Gary Payton II and Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard who was a dominating +19 tonight
Curry did Luke Kennard dirty there
I’ve never seen Joe Lacob and Luke Kennard in the same room just sayin
Luke Kennard time
"I mean, let's be real, Taj Gibson is better than Schayes ever was, and Boban would probably be Wilt level iconic if he'd played in the 50's and 60's. Luke Kennard would work Pete Maravich. Talent/skill/training nowadays is just at such a higher level.   The old guys gotta get their respect for their era though"
No Luke Kennard   0/10
"7' Batum so we could have a really good center that can shoot, 6'9 Kawhi because that's probably the ideal height for a player like him.  Or I could just make Luke Kennard 6'11 so we have our own tingus."
"No, that's almost always too much for a 4th guard.   Compare him against other 4th guards (excluding 4th guards still on rookie scale contracts):   - Dennis Schroder (behind Brown, Smart, Richardson): $5.9M  - Bruce Brown (behind Harden, Irving, Mills): $4.7M. Note: Mills also makes less than Shamet.   - Trey Burke (behind Doncic, Hardaway, Bullock): $3.2M. Note: Bullock also makes less than Shamet.   - TJ McConnell (behind Brogdon, Levert, Lamb): $8.4M. Note: Lamb also makes less than Shamet.   - Kendrick Nunn (behind Lebron, Westbrook, Horton-Tucker): $5.1M. Note: Tucker also makes less than Shamet.   I only saw 3 4th guards who make more than Shamet:   - Joe Ingles (Mitchell, Conley, Clarkson) - much better than Shamet.   - Luke Kennard (George, Jackson, Bledsoe) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid.   - Patrick Beverley (Russell, Edwards, Beasley) - better than Shamet, widely considered to be overpaid."
I keep saying Merrill could be like Luke Kennard
&gt; Feels like teams like the idea of him more than the reality of him.  To be fair... Being traded doesn't mean a team doesn't like you. 76ers were going after a star in Tobias Harris and traded the farm for him. Clips traded him and a pick for a SUPPOSED upgrade in Luke Kennard (he scored real well that last year in detroit). Nets traded him away to avoid paying him.
The Luke Kennard special.
Luke kennard was a 17 point per game scorer and can do more than shamet
His contract is a steal compared to what clippers offered to Luke Kennard
Huerter is what people think Luke Kennard is/want him to be
Great deal. This is what the Clippers gave to Luke Kennard.
Gobert was getting bodied by a washed up Cousins and failing to post up Luke Kennard lol. being the guy on his own team would be a disaster  [imagine this being the main guy](https://streamable.com/xsg42h)
Luke Kennard
This is why OP also gave the percentages. AD is a 2.4% better 3pt shooter than Giannis on much lower volume. Luke Kennard was 2.4% better than Steph Curry last season on much lower volume.   Luke Kennard is not a significantly better 3pt shooter than Steph and AD isn’t signficantly better than Giannis.
"All part of their plan to lower his value until they trade him for Luke Kennard, Serge Ibaka, and Eric Bledsoe"
"I haven't heard anything to polarizing about any of these guys that I don't believe or that they haven't already done.  I'm really low on Aaron Holiday and Luke Kennard, but I haven't seen any hype for those guys.  R.J. Barrett actually gets undervalued imo. I see him not getting his dues most times young players or the Knicks are brought up."
"These are the players I can't remember hearing a bad thing about all summer long. When a person says any of these names come up on a podcast, the other person immediately falls all over themselves to agree so emphatically that they might also take some credit for bringing him up. Saying you expect big things from these players is like saying the password to enter the sports media hootch parlor.   ...and if you have a 100% approval rating from group-thinky NBA podcasters, I'm sorry but you are probably overrated.  1.

usually but Gobert being unable to post up Luke Kennard is solely his fault
for real. Gobert couldn't post up Luke Kennard in the playoffs and people still defended him saying it wasn't his fault
"Luke ""White Uncle"" Kennard"
"Was wearing my Kennard jersey at the store when I rain into Steph Curry, he said he wishes he was half the shooter Luke Nukem is"
Nuke Kennard  Luke Nukem Cool Hand Luke Black Michael Jordan
"He has a lot of potential but I don't think he is worth 11 million a year.  Then again, the Clippers gave Luke Kennard 13 million a year and I would rather have Terance Mann, 100%.  11 mil a year is basically top 120 in the NBA pay.  He don't usually start, he is basically a 7-10th man bench player and you are giving him 11 million.  That is starter pay for someone who just isn't good enough, and he really shouldn't get more than 5-7 mil a year until he actually proves he deserves to be in that 4th 5th 6th mann(lol) catagory.  I think the Clippers overpay both Kennard and Mann, but good for them for being able to get that sort of pay."

"Luke Kennard, he will either blow up or Brandon Boston will take his minutes.  I think he goes crazy this year though."
Luke Kennard
People finally see the point pistons fans made for years.  When Luke kennard will get an MVP you wont be surprised
Klay would be a better Luke Kennard without his defense.  Can't just say he can be Klay based on offense alone.
Luke Kennard green light
Luke Kennard
"for homer reasons  Terance Mann, Luke Kennard, Brandon Boston Jr, Morris, Batum"
Luke Kennard aint no bitch though.
Luke kennard is one of the most passive deferential human beings ive ever seen on a basketball court
Ty Lue gave Luke Kennard depression
Luke Kennard for Kyrie. This is definitely BS though this is a guy who had 27 points on 50/40/90
I guess Luke Kennard is going to ask for a trade now after his coach called him out publicly
"yeah but i wouldn't say they outsmarted themselves. my point is that not a single team in the league outside the Jazz had Don high. Luke Kennard was taken over him FFS. the nuggs had 2 lotto pgs at the time, it didn't make any sense to even consider taking another one."
"batum is on the team, you lose luke kennard who  didn’t play for a long time because he couldn’t hit a shot, and since you got reggie for free you could just keep him and russ depending on the matchup"
"trading luke kennard, ibaka and bledsoe is hardly going to affect your team when you still have so many useful players"

I think Luke Kennard went to a game this year lol
love/hate has to be Luke Kennard  Just take the open jumper Luke.  You don't need to pull it down every time your defender happens to take a step in your direction.
"I enjoyed watching him in summer league, but there is no way this kid can help us at the NBA level yet. He got shut down against the other teams top defenders and he makes Luke Kennard look like prime Artest."
"I’ve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He’s totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn’t enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It’s harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he’s just not really quick. He’ll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he’s not automatic like Durant so he’s inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he’s on, sometimes he’s off.  So I think it’s a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it’s easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there’s no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It’s when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he’s good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
Luke kennard Is a bummer when he’s bad because it’s always confidence man.
"Question for the Clips fans in here, would you trade Kennard for Eric Gordon?   Basically getting a proven veteran version of Kennard who is better defensively. Luke is probably the better shooter, but EG can do more off the bounce.   Plus if your main competition going forward is the Warriors, why not get a guy who is very familiar playing them in 2 high stakes series.   Plus you’re bringing him back home to where he started his career."
"feed him when he has a smaller man on him, got luke kennard on him? well mitchell and JC will just ignore that and iso that shit."
"Luke Kennard, lockdown defender"
Luke Kennard???
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Oh. Lol. I thought you were saying I misunderstood you. Shouldn’t you be hanging with the fam on turkey day instead of redditing? Or not American?   Clips play the pistons tomorrow. I’m not American but I am thankful for Reggie Jackson and Luke Kennard. And Marcus Morris I guess. Thanks Pistons!
"That's a major undersell. Guys like Luke Kennard, Malik Beasley, Marcus Morris, Bertans, Markkanen, Duncan Robinson, Bojan, Joe Harris, Aaron Gordon are all making 14 mil+. There's no reason Bobby couldn't get that much."
"And, you know, I would love to have some like Luke Kennard on this Laker team. What a spark off the bench he would be, contributing excellent outside shooting, and underrated playmaking ability."
"Luke Kennard looks like a podcaster lol, I cant explain why but he could pass for the chapo trap house 4th mic"
Idk I was thinking more of a Luke Kennard/Wagner/Porzingis/T.J. McConnell/Valanciunas/ with a bit of Sabonis type of player but you're probably not too far off.
I get your point but it’s not a good one. Pistons wanted to draft Haliburton but they declined. He has the same agent as Luke Kennard &amp; his agent felt disrespected the Pistons didnt give him a contract he wanted &amp; told them not to draft him
"What's weird is you guys had a lot of good role player shooters just a few seasons ago (Luke Kennard, Tony Snell, Reggie Bullock, Wayne Ellington) and now all of them are gone"
Luke Kennard 10th is hilarious. He was literally hunted in the playoffs
"it's actually pretty easy. Clippers didn't even care about Gobert and smothered the ball handler. if the pass to Gobert did get through, they just stunted at him with a corner defender and that was enough to make him freeze up because he's too slow to make the secondary read and not capable of dribbling more than once  they even got away with rotating Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson onto him in the post several times"
"Honestly, the disrespect to Luke Kennard is real."
"Wow look MPJ aka the worst defender on his team is 3rd, also Luke Kennard is 10th lmao"
"And, you know, I would love to have someone like Luke Kennard on the Lakers. Good shooter from the outside, and excellent free throw shooter, and a decent playmaker too."
Why do they call Luke Kennard the nard dog? Is it related to the office? He doesn’t look like Andy Bernard.  Is it just because his last name is kennard ?
Tax doesn’t exist to the clippers and saying that Luke kennard is better than wall is certainly a take lol
"Prime Blake dragged a horrendous Pistons team to the playoffs. His supporting cast was Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, Wayne Ellington.   Throw prime Draymond on that 2019 Pistons roster and it’s a lottery team"
"Among 2-man lineups in the league, they're +95 in 193 min playing together, only trailing lineups containing either Steph, Jokic or (lol) Luke Kennard.

"Man Clips should fuckin love the Pistons. We basically gifted you your current team!  - Took Blake Griffin off your hands, one of the worst contracts of all time, which freed up cap space to sign Kawhi   - Gifted you a first round pick in that trade, which became Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and later packaged for Paul George  - Drafted and developed Luke Kennard, gave him to you for pennies  - Developed Reggie Jackson for 5 years, bought him out so you could have him for free  - Created &amp; developed a defensive intensity within a key part of your coaching staff in your WCF run (Chauncey)    If yall win a ring the Pistons should get one too, just sayin 🤷🏾‍♂️"
luke kennard would simply out score steph and klay combined
Somebody get Luke Kennard some Rogaine or tell him to shave his head
"Luke Kennard has a clause in his contract where he can earn a $334k bonus by keeping his defensive rating below 105.  If you're familiar with Luke, you know why this is funny.  If you're not, lets just say that his career Drtg is 112 and there was really no chance he was going to earn that bonus.  At least, that's what I thought.  Kennard has played much improved defense so far this season.  He still has trouble staying in front of his man but he's been doing a better job of fighting for position, moving his feet, and generally competing.  He's still really slow but he's trying and the results have shown.  His Drtg has hovered between 107 and 105 for the season so far and currently sits at 106.  With some luck, he might actually earn that bonus."
"&gt;Come on People hunt Steph all the time. He's perfectly fine for a PG, but he's not a good defender.  Steph Curry is actually a pretty good defender, the only reason he's hunted is because he was surrounded by 4 all nba level defender in Green, Klay, Iggy and KD.  You could put KCP or Lowry in that lineup and they would still be  hunted by the likes of Harden, Lillard, Kyrie etc. Modern NBA offenses systematically target the weakest link in the opposing teams defense but that doesnt automatically imply your a bad defender just because you get targeted, if the weakest link in your defense is steph curry then you're doing pretty good.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Guards just don't have that much impact on your defense in the modern NBA - that's why Klay missing doesn't matter   Tell that to Jrue Holiday or Marcus Smart lol, Jrue defense on CP3 was one the biggest reasons the bucks beat the suns  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;The vast majority of modern defense is scheme + having mobile big men that can protect the rim and so play high in the PnR.   But guys who can execute a wide variety of defensive schemes are known as impactful defenders, having strong defensive anchors are obviously important but you still need high level perimeter defenders if you want your defense to hold up against high level offensive teams. You can have AD anchoring your defense and it wouldn't matter if he's surrounded by the like of JR Smith or Luke Kennard"
I guess this proves once and for all that Luke kennard is the best player ever
"Your friend had an agenda and was being disingenuous.  I was pushing back against their disingenuousness.  There's no way that a reasonable person would say that  Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, Lee, Iguodala, Looney, Bjelica, Porter, Payton  have less talent as a group than  Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, Terance Mann, Eric Bledsoe, Luke Kennard, Ivica Zubac, Isaiah Hartenstein  Those are all the players (Steph and PG excluded) that have played a minimum of 150 minutes for each team.  You may notice that GSW has 9 names and the Clips have 7.  Here's the thing.  If you guys want to push an agenda, don't do it while misrepresenting what is happening with other teams.  The Cips aren't some stacked roster.  Don't tell lies about us."
"I thought T Mann would be making the next step, but guys like Luke Kennard and Zu are playing way better this year"
we're paying Luke Kennard $16 mil a year to do basically the same thing Robinson is doing
Clippers had the better white shooters. Luke Kennard and Duncan Robinson.
Duncan Robinson is dollar tree Luke kennard
My guy luke kennard is getting 3/41M and people made fun of that contract last year lol
"I feel like Luke Kennard has ascended to the point where his firstborn is going to be a shadow of him, rather than him being a footnote in his son's development. Thoughts?"
Luke kennard baby
"Clippers don't have a lot of guard depth.  Reggie is averaging a career high in minutes per game by 3 minutes, Terance Mann is playing over 30 mpg off the bench, Luke Kennard is at around 27 mpg.  Minus Bledsoe, that's the Clips guard rotation and Terance plays some of those minutes at forward too.  Clips are pretty thin."
I will never get over us passing on him for Luke Kennard.
rest of the team falls off like who?  Donovan who went from averaging 26-&gt; 34 in the playoffs? nearly every rotation Jazz player saw a huge uptick in their 3P% in the Clippers series and had 5 of them shooting 40%+   is it too much to ask for Gobert to make a basic layup? or create his own shot once or twice? or be able to post up Luke Kennard?

Luke Kennard is so deadly
Insert something about Luke kennard having a bad contract.
best part was Luke kennard completely clearing the lane for him lol
Luke Kennard is not a turnstile this year!
Luke Kennard is a right that shoots left.
"That defensive rating stat doesn't mean that much. D'Angelo Russel and Luke kennard have defensive ratings of 89.6 and 93.3 respectively. DeRozan, who is constantly trashed for his defense, has 94.5. Let's not pretend Jokic is the anchor of the nuggets defense all of a sudden. Dikembe Mutumbo?"
Feels like they could easily be 6-1 right now though. Games were still close even when everyone besides PG and Luke Kennard were bricking open shots
&gt; Luke “Jedi mind trick” Kennard  Luke “~~Skyfucker~~ Skywalker” Kennard
"I’d bet he has some resentment towards Kennard. That money they gave Luke effectively ended up being Pat Bev’s money, so they moved him"
I watched Luke Kennard defend Gobert in the paint without consequence in the playoffs so nah I don't think the Warriors worried bout that

Pat Bev and Luke Kennard are going to throw hands on Friday.  Guaranteed.
Luke Kennard hands down
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
"Luke Nukem Nuke Kennard.  Reggie ""Big Government"" Jackson."
Give the kid a chance. We haven’t seen enough for Bust talk yet. But wow Jalen Green is already amazing. The Pistons always pick the wrong guy. Detroit took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell.
Clippers entire offense is Luke Kennard and Paul George. That's all.
"I've been lower on Winslow than the limbo world champion, but who else is there? I'm not buying Luke Kennard stock!"
"Trading Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson. Haven’t won a playoff game since..  Another terrible one was taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, when Mitchell didn’t miss a single shot in his workout. Or taking Stanley Johnson over Devin Booker, a Pistons fan 🤦🏾‍♂️"
"Yes, to come to the clippers, team up with MVPG and form a superteam of George Klawing Dame's Nards (Luke Kennard). /S obviously."
what circus shot? it was a basic layup attempt and he bricked it off the backboard lmao  it matters when he gets schemed out in the playoffs every year and the defense can switch Luke Kennard on him without consequence
"It often happens when the role players get cold and the star carries for 2 or 3 quarters, then the role players end up getting even colder. You need some more chuckers on the team who will sling it no matter what, like Luke Kennard, who knows his job is to just shoot the rock at every opportunity. The other Clip role players started concentrating on defense and just defering to PG on offense and by the 4th quarter Paul was visibly gassed and his shots were hitting the front of the rim."
"As a biased Thunder fan, the difference is guys like Reggie Jackson have a whole career to show they aren’t a star. Eric Bledsoe was bad all of last year. Luke Kennard was getting DNPs last year. These guys have career history that does not match up with last years playoffs"
Don’t be disrespecting Luke Kennard like that
"Luke ""YMCA Legend"" Kennard"
Oh!  Luke Kennard (canard).  Missed that one.
"A lot of people are looking good defensively due to low sample size.  Min 25 possessions (DeAndre hunter has defended 46) DeAndre hunter is 51st out of 224 players in PPP. Compared to DeAndre hunters .739 ppp, number one is Luke Kennard at .226 ppp on 31 possessions. Poeltl is 199th at 1.095. Tyler herro, Duncan Robinson and demar derozan all in top 20 lowest PPP. Harden 25th. It's just crazy rn."
"i'm not hating, i've always had a soft spot for the Clips even since the Eric Piatakowski days, Trez was instant offense off the bench wheras Ibaka is not the same player he was in TO.  Luke Kennard got a bag for no reason  i just never bought into the narrative that the Clips were a shoo in for the WCF with the other teams in west improving as well"
clippers gotta pay luke kennard $45 million over the next three years
still better than Luke Kennard!
at least he got to play. Montrez Harrell and Luke Kennard being paid what they are to not play is crazy.  Harrell seems like a terrible fit at the lakers.
"Are you telling me a 2022-2023 LAC team with a 33 yo PG13 and Marcus Morris, and 26 yo Luke Kennard and Zubac wouldn't be a title contender?! ^^/s"
Bah gawd those are Luke Kennard statlines
"the funny thing is, bertans contract isnt even the worst in the NBA, that award goes to luke kennard"
Bertans = Latvian Luke Kennard
"For sure. If guys like Pat Bev and Morris got no chance, Luke Kennard might as well be a chair."
Bertans is Luke Kennard east
"Idk why luke kennard isn’t playing when all of pat bev, Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson are missing threes AND are getting beat on defense. If they’re all getting beat anyways might as well throw kennard out there for shooting"
Who are they sending for lowry? PG? Luke Kennard?
"This is just my opinion /bro/, but like r/nba is often way less fun that it seems from the inside. Mostly because a lot of fanbases tend to take themselves wayyy to seriously, from the routine *""put some respek on [my fav player]'s name""* after a hot night out to the endless victim complex. Like on the MMA side we do have BJJ truthers that think boxing isn't real and Valentina simps, but even then... they're not as bad as Mousasi's fans.              Granted, it helps memes and the general lack of seriousness that in combat sports almost everyone is either 1) insane or; 2) acts like they are. Stuff like Joshua Fabia is the tip of the iceberg. That shit happened in the NBA you'd have months of content out of the blog/espn machine.     That being said I'm so looking forward to the endless clowning we're probably gonna give the Clippers in a few days. Extra fun because Clips fans seem to be on board. Like I'm almost sorry for Kawhi that his front office spend all those money on Luke Kennard and a Morris twin. Almost sorry. But hey, he can always ask for a trade!"
"Do you really think Kennard should be running the offense for the Clippers? Not PG, not Kawhi, not Rondo, but Kennard? He's not a guy who should be running the show for the Clippers, no sir. He had about two month's worth of decent games for a truly awful team and then his knees gave out. He was not good this season for the Clippers and that's the reason why he's sitting now. You guys acting like Luke Kennard is the key for the Clippers are just being delusional."
"He gave Kawhi an advance copy of Windows 11. Part of the reason why there's been chemistry issues is because Kawhi's teammates still only have Windows 10. Luke Kennard owns a Mac, that's why he's been on the bench."
"Kennard isn't some offensive wizard though. He's not Lou Williams or Jamal Crawford or something, where you just put him in and he's a walking bucket. He's just a 3-pt threat who stands on the other side of the court, and the Clippers have a bunch of guys who can also do that who at the same time aren't the worst defenders in the league. You've seen how badly Luka is hunting mismatches already with guys like Zubac and Beverley, now imagine he's got Luke fucking Kennard to pick on. And the only reason for the Clippers to open themselves up to such carnage defensively is so Kennard can go stand at the 3-pt line? That's a recipe for disaster."
Clippers front office thought they were getting Luka Nard not Luke Kennard.
"Serge is there long-term as well. Kinda crazy how they still are running Pat Bev and Reggie as their primary playmakers and how they are still using Morris as one of the primary matchups for Luka. Bev can't create in the playoffs (Bledsoe syndrome). Morris can not guard Luka. It's like they learned nothing from the Bubble. Both the Clippers and Bucks disappointed last year, one team greatly changed their defensive philosophy and traded for a legit playmaker (now they look much better suited for the playoffs). The other scapegoated their coach and ran it back, adding Luke Kennard and Serge Ibaka (later Rajon Rondo). Yes, the Clippers lack draft assets, but it's almost like they hardly made an effort."
this team is freaking toast.  after everything they gave up for Leonard and George they have basically nothing to do to improve.  And now it's pretty likely Leonard is going to leave and they'll just be stuck with George and luke kennard on a 30 win team
"&gt; Morris at the time they traded for him from Knicks didn't cost much I think,   Morris, if I recall correctly, was the Knicks best player and actually played well that season (which might not be saying much).   Luke Kennard also had a breakout season in Detroit.  Maybe the Clippers just foolishly bought high, or maybe there is something about the Clippers locker room culture that doesn't bring out the best of their role players."
You forgot paying Luke Kennard $16 mil a year to sit on the bench in the playoffs and not play.
They extended him without him ever putting on the jersey.  I know it was a three team trade with the nets involved and the Pistons ended up with the 19th pick and took Saddiq Bey. I’m not sure if the clippers could have gotten that pick or not but can you imagine Saddiq Bey on the roster in rotation with Kawhi and PG on a rookie deal instead  of Luke Kennard for 64 mil.
"Traded a first round pick  for Luke Kennard and a bunch of second round picks then gave him $64 mil before he even put on a jersey.   Pistons took Saddiq Bey with the pick. They could have just took Saddiq Bey, saved a bunch of money, and had a guy that could rotate in and out with Kawhi and PG in the lineup."
"Is the Clippers roster really that appealing?   Kawhi and PG? Good. Who else? Luke Kennard? Marcus Morris? Pat Bev? Roster ain’t that good, although I though Ibaka and Rondo would help more.   Lakers have Bron and AD, and at least maybe Denis or Caruso will do really well."
"Dont forget luke ""dnp"" kennard for 4/64"
Same thing with kennard. People in clips sub want boogie and Luke to get minutes. 🤦
"Yes, only if you fail to recognize that Luke Kennard did not score"
"man wdym?? dawg yall ask for PG, yall got rondo. Yall ask for a shooter, yall got Luke Kennard for four seconds. Yall ask for vets, and yall got batum and Ibaka. Maybe it's just your team. Cmon there's plenty of blame to go around."
"Idk if they could’ve gotten anyone else, but the Luke Kennard pickup should have been a legit point guard."
"How boned are the Clips?  * Their money is tied up with Kawhi, PG, Luke Kennard, Marcus Morris, Zubac, Pat Bev. * They have no picks. * They just tanked to get to a guy who's gonna own them for the next decade.  They are most likely not making the 2nd round this year, let alone the WCF. This is after the epic collapse last year followed by a change in coaching. Who could've predicted when Kawhi and PG came together 2 summers ago?  Damn if Doc isn't laughing his ass off after taking shots at both Ty and PG over the course of the season."
"&gt;Because just having Kawhi and PG is making a killing in ticket sales and branding.  Is it?  Because Clippers playoff tickets could be had for as little as $30 for game 1.  Not sure how game 2 sales went.  Clippers have no choice but to run it back.  They are well over the cap, so they can't sign any free agents except for vets.  If they try to trade PG it will likely be for cents on the dollar.  And beside, the problem isn't even PG, the problem is Pat ""trick ya'll"" Beverly, Marcus ""Jr"" Morris Sr, and Luke ""DNP"" Kennard.  Nobody wants those trash role players and their trash contracts (Beverly is expiring)."
"But in all seriousness, Luke Kennard was nowhere to be found tonight!"
"Did not play Serge Ibaka and Luke Kennard, but was perfectly fine letting PatBev and Reggie get cooked over and over"
Play Luke Kennard
"If one thing's for certain, Luke Kennard didn't contribute to this losing."
"Yo clippers fan is  Luke Kennard injured, suck or what ? They pay him all thay money to sit on the bench i dont get it"
one analyst might still prefer Luke Kennard to Russell Westbrook
They need to blame the fact that their roster is constructed terribly. No good defensive bigs at all and their only playmaker is rondo. Luke Kennard is being paid 16 mil a year to not even PLAY.
can u tell me the story behind Luke Kennard? why is he getting DNPed?
Luke Kennard getting paid to be a cheerleader lemme get some of that charity money man
PLAY LUKE KENNARD ALREADY HOLY SHIT
"LUKA OWNS THE CLIPPERS.  also, 64 Million dollar man Luke Kennard gets another fucking DNP lmfao"
And dnp mvp Luke kennard too
Luke Kennard with my dream job: make $14M a year and have two straight DNP in the playoffs.
that Luke kennard contract doe doe doe
Where's Luke kennard?
"Yeah, wtf is up with that? Where is Luke Kennard?"
Bring in fucking luke kennard. There’s no defense being played lol
I remember a duo of Terrence Mann and Luke Kennard torching my Hawks earlier this year. Unleash them Lou. You know you want to
Play Terrence Mann and Luke kennard.
"Morris/Ibaka/Mann do not border on great.     Ibaka is old, hurt and rusty. Morris is a great 3 point shooter but he's very hot/cold and he's overrated on defense. He also can't pass.    Mann never plays, the fact they play Reggie/Beverly and oftentimes Luke Kennard over him says it all."
What is the filler? Luke Kennard! Hahaha
"Yes, that is correct. Fuck Luke Kennard, wasteman."
Donovan Mitchell.  He is promising.   Luke Kennard only promised to keep us bang average.
"All teams involved in that trade got a decent return. Detroit got Saddiq Bey and cash considerations, Nets got Bruce Brown and Landry Shamet, Clippers got Luke Kennard and 4 second round picks."
Luke Kennard does not make 16 mil a year
The fact that they got kennard for four seconds was wow. Pistons couldn't even get a 1st for Luke.
"Is this site accurate?  If so there really shouldnt be any ambiguity.    ""Luke Kennard signed a 3 year / $41,236,364 contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, including $41,236,364 guaranteed, and an annual average salary of $13,745,455.""   https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/luke-kennard-23607/#:~:text=Current%20Contract,annual%20average%20salary%20of%20%2413%2C745%2C455."
Luke Kennard is like art and money laundering.
Paying Luke Kennard all that money to not even play lol
luke kennard is a bum hes that trash and worhless to even play
Reggie &amp; him were disappointing. Why aren’t they playing luke Kennard? Surely they didn’t pay him all that money just for him to spectate on the bench
Did Luke kennard get injured or is he just out of the rotation?
Is Luke kennard out of the rotation or is he injured?
Can we please talk about how the Clippers signed Luke Kennard to as $64M to sit on the bench with a DNP - CD in the playoffs? What the hell was that contract
Luke Kennard is on the Clippers idiot.
I just want the Clippers to throw Kennard out there for a few possessions so we can see some Luke on Luka action.
"Patrick needs to be more agressive. I'm not saying he should chuck up 17 shots, but a lot of the times when I watch him play, he doesn't take many shot opportunities. He's a bit like Luke Kennard, over-trying to only take the most absolute perfect shots."
1.Kawhi  2. Paul George  3. Marcus Morriss  4. Zubac  5. Luke Kennard  6. Terrence Mann  7. Patrick Beverly  8. Rajon Rondo  9. Ibaka   10.Reggie Jackson
Luke Kennard gotta be on this list somewhere  Clippers paid him 80 million for what I dont know
"Was looking for the deep cuts  Luke kennard, Aaron gordon and Kendrick Nunn"
Clippers:  reggie Jackson 43.3% Paul George 41.1% Kawhi leonard 39.8% Marcus Morris 47.3% Pick last player: Luke kennard 44.6% Nic batum 40.4%
would you consider luke kennard to be a cotton candy machine
Zachary Lowe is an idiot. He’s always wrong about everything. He said he wouldn’t trade Luke Kennard for Russell Westbrook. Biggest clown in the media.
"Rooting for Clippers, with Luke Kennard for FMVP."
Now I see why they signed Luke Kennard to 13mil a year. Expensive for a tank commander but he gets results

When really it’s Luke Kennard just playing angry bird with ESPN notifications on
"I think 95% of Mitchell's action on them was with screens, so what can they do really. —This is as much on the strategy of Luke Kennard hedging/blitzing the ball handler (which Mitchell split) and on lack of rest for the Clips."
Luke Kennard just passing the baton to PatBev
"Hypothetically, you could ruin a legendary NBA moment (unanimous MVP), because some children thought it was funny to vote for Luke Kennard"
Luke Kennard can't win with these cats
Ty Lue’s defense is baffling. What’s the point of having Paul George and Kawhi on you’re team if you’re just going to let the opposing team’s best perimeter player get a switch onto Luke Kennard at will? This happened with the Mavs series too. Can someone explain because I don’t get it.
The switching was worse because the other defender was often luke kennard as well
"That was Ingles covering Kawhi bro. Bojan, the other balding white guy, was in the corner covering Luke Kennard lol.  But yes, Ingles was great that possession."
"And then he had [the 7th worst playoff game](https://stathead.com/tiny/EPVuv) in the last 5 years, thanks to a nobody who looked like a part-time accountant.  It would be the equivalent of, idk, Luke Kennard inducing a 2/16 shooting night out of Kyrie Irving in an elimination game. You don't really care how well Kyrie did in the early games of the series; if a balding dork shuts down someone who has the reputation of one of the best 5 players in the league, it's funny, it's memorable, and you rag on that top 5 player for being shitty against someone that they by all rights should have absolutely owned."
Put some respect on Clippers legend Luke Kennard.  The man had me terrified for a while there. Would have been hilarious if he walked away with the most points!
They expecting to get 18 pts out of Luke Kennard every game to keep them in it?
"I’m not gonna go back and watch the whole game.  But that happens maybe 2-3 times.  Luke  kennard got cooked.  Reggie Jackson got cooked.  Rudy Gobert played just fine.   Like you said he’s gonna get scored on, beat in some of those situations that’s not getting cooked."
Exactly. If kawhii or pg aren’t scoring for this team who is? Marcus Morris? Luke Kennard? Reggie Jackson? This team is built off of those two dudes scoring and commanding so much attention that it opens up the other guys for easy shots. If pg continues to play like this on the biggest stages he cannot be our second best player on a championship team. He’d be a great third option though.
Wtf? Kawhi isn't likeable? Reggie Jackson seems cool. Ty Lue is a meme. Luke Kennard is a gr8 underdog. What are y'all talking about lol
Yeah you can have the best 2 stoppers in the league but if they just switch the scorer onto Luke Kennard it doesn't matter how good they are
"Morris and Luke should have been taken off long ago, morris because he was ass and Kennard because he was completely gassed and Utah exploited it well, not like hes a good defender anyways"
It's like Lou Will never left. Incoming 6moty Luke Kennard!!
Luke “Bryn Forbes” Kennard
"But not the trio of Luke Kennard, Kawhi, and PG"
Luke Kennard did go off tho. That being said I think this is gonna be a great series
Luke motherfucking Kennard was 4/5 from 3 and they would pass it to marcus morris so he can lay some more bricks
Luke “64 Mil” Kennard
Wasted q great luke kennard game....  But in all seriousness whoever wins this series would be exhausted as he'll if this is how the series is going to be
Luke Kennard out here getting targeted in broad daylight.

Luke Kennard can't win with these cats.
GET LUKE DOUGLAS KENNARD HELP.
Ya'll wanted to know why Kennard got his 3/$45 extension?  3/3 from 3pt in a 4 minute span in the 1st quarter.  Ya'll wanted to know why Kennard was on the bench for most of the Mavs series?  He got relentlessly hunted on defense in the 4th quarter.  Ya'll got the full Luke Kennard experience today.
GET LUKE DOUGLAS KENNARD HELP.
Yeah maybe have your 2X DPOY guard Donovan instead of Luke fucking Kennard at the end of the game
Why the fuck is Luke Kennard still in? He’s getting walked past over and over
Luke Kennard can’t win with these bums
Luke Kennard reminds me a lot of a kid I went to school with who I watched eat his own boogers in kindergarten. Never told him. But it's something I'll never forget.
LUKE KENNARD GETTIN COOKED LOL
Luke Kennard on defense 🔥🔥🔥
Why the fuck arent we giving the ball to luke kennard more? My mans is 7/8 and 4/5
Luke FUCKING Kennard is 4/5 3 pointers and they giving it TO FUCKING MARCUS MORRIS SR????
If LAC pulls this out...it will because of a stellar performance of Luke Kennard making up for Paul George. Never thought I'd type that out but here we are.
Luke Kennard is carrying us LMFAO

I would take Luke Kennard over jimmy butler
Luke Kennard is white
is Luke Kennard the best player in this game
Mavs really made something out of the clips in that series.   Boogie can be serviceable with bigs like gobert and jokic  Luke kennard is an x factor  Clips playing at their normal 3P shooting game
"We're leading with Kawhi and PG playing like crap with Luke Kennard leading and a Boogie appearance, wow.  We kinda let up in the second quarter though, but I'd expect Utah to bounce back a bit at least."
Why wasn't Luke Kennard played more earlier in the Dallas series?
"As i guessed, leading scorer on the clippers at the half - Luke Kennard"
Luke Kennard has been the Clippers best player so far so that’s a win for the Jazz. You just have to hope they cool off from three.   His anomaly 11 point game is covering the Clippers lead right now.

Luke Kennard looks like he just got out of the y.
I completely forgot Luke Kennard existed in this team lmao
luke kennard owns the suns
Clippers use Luke Kennard like he's a defensive specialist. If you arent going to get him shots then dont play him.
Lol at Luke Kennard pressing up on CP3 and immediately getting blown by
That's just Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard about to drop 39 on 13-15 from 3pt
This is also very much a byproduct of Lue running Batum into the ground in the reg season which was another constant talking point why he was using him so much and asking him to do so much stuff like guard guys like KAT. It's also just in general no real logic to playing him 37 min game 1 then only 15 game 2. And at the very least if you are going to limit his minutes save it to have him out there the last 5-10 minutes instead of playing Luke Kennard because he hit a couple shots.
"Yeah, I think Simmons will only be unlocked once he's on a team where he can play that Draymond Green small ball center role while surrounded by shooters. He's stuck where he's at because that will never happen next to Embiid, but it would be the exact same thing playing next to AD. Simmons on the Lakers would just be more of the same for him, with him relegated to the dunker's spot on offense. Unless he suddenly develops a good jump shot, the only way he's gonna provide close to his best value is as the team's sole big man on the floor.  If you're trying to get him to LA he'd be much more effective on the Clippers, because of this, but I don't think they have anything Philly wants (since I'm assuming Kawhi and PG aren't available). Maybe a trade for Terrance Mann along with Marcus Morris and Luke Kennard to match salaries? I dunno."
"ESPN sucks so much. Games never come down to just 1 play. If PG hits both free throws, Suns coulda still hit a 3 and gone to OT and won. If PG hits one, Suns could win on a 3 or go to OT with a two. If DeMarcus guards the inbound differently, the lob might not be there. If Luke Kennard hits a random 3 earlier in the game, they might be up 4 instead of 1.   There are a million ifs, and focusing on the one that allows you to blast a player just for the sake of it isn't right.   The clippers could never string together stops. They desperately needed rim protection yesterday. That's the bigger reason they lost. Don't be ""consistent"" if you're consistently awful. PG shares some blame for sure, but he alone didn't blow the game."
Blame Ty Lue for only playing Nic Batum 15 min last night way more than that play. Cousins and Zubac just didnt do a good enough job on a laser perfect pass by Jae. Drank the Luke Kennard kool aid too hard because he hit a couple cool shots in the 4th.
"Cam Payne and Luke Kennard getting buckets in the fourth quarter of the most important game of the season so far.  So, yes it’s been fucking fantastic. Best postseason ever."
I like reggie Jackson and Luke kennard and mann but the rest of the guys prolly not that much
As long as Luke Kennard does not quit it ain't over
Should have put Luke Kennard at the line
Luke Kennard earning that $64M 😤
Luke Kennard aint no bitch
The Luke Kennard Quarter
If Luke Kennard is missing open threes you know it's a strange game
Why TF does Luke Kennard never move?
Luke Kennard and Terance Mann are really the same age huh
"Cameron Payne vs Luke Kennard, instant classic"
Luke Kennard White boy Summer VP
hey luke kennard was in the game!
scott foster faster than luke kennard confirmed
luke kennard - americas strongest man
"The Clippers paid $64mil for a parking cone, I mean Luke Kennard."
"Luke Kennard can stretch the court with his shooting and Simmons cannot, guess Kennard is better than Simmons too right? I promise you no team is seriously worried about a Dort 3. Simmons is the better player and no GM is taking fucking Dort over Simmons lmao"
That Luke Kennard contract lol
&gt;I’ve been saying since that game that Luke Kennard and Terrance Mann is the most dangerous two man lineup in ~~the~~ **NBA History**.  FTFY
Ben Simmons for Luke Kennard who says no?
"Clippers took turns running a train on him. freaking Terrance Mann scored a career high lmao. every year Gobert gets targeted on defense  and Gobert has to be able to score against Luke Kennard within 3 feet of the basket to take pressure off Mitchell. i know, how crazy of me to suggest. a 7 footer being able to catch a simple pass and finish a layup. wow."
I’ve been saying since that game that Luke Kennard and Terrance Mann is the most dangerous two man lineup in the NBA.
I think Luke Kennard for Simmons would be a pretty good deal for both teams. Clippers get a small ball center and the Sixers get another shooter to put around Embiid.
Contracts aside: Who says no to Luke Kennard for Ben Simmons?
"""Luke Kennard on Kawhi Leonard"" is like a bizarre tongue-twister"
"I don’t think you can call it a lost art. 21.3% of Booker’s points these playoffs are from midrange. Of players with at least 4 games and 15 plus mpg, six guys have a higher percentage of their points from midrange than that, nine last year with a higher percentage than Booker’s now, and eleven the year before.  This year its CP3, KD, Beal, Ish Smith, D’Andre Hunter, and Carmelo in that order.  Last postseason, it was Carmelo, Middleton, Seth, CP3, Markell’s Fultz, Gallinari, Terrence Ross, Trey Burke, and Tyler Johnson.  Luke Kennard, Demar, Monte Morris, Collison, Schroeder, Myles Turner, Ish Smith, Aldridge, KD, Lou, and Klay were the ones in 2019."
The disrespect to Luke Kennard
"If it makes you feel better, the Pistons taking Luke Kennard over Mitchell is still astounding to me."
He was being guarded by Luke Kennard.
"Apparently, the Pistons was down to between Stanley Johnson and Devin Booker and it was split 50/50 between the FO and coaching staff. Obviously, they took Stanley but Booker would've been a great fit for the Pistons since he's from Michigan and was born and raised in Grand Rapids.   They also had the opportunity to take Donovan Mitchell over Luke Kennard but chose Kennard over him. That's two potential superstar picks that the Pistons missed out on big time"
"""We realized that we couldn't guard him with Luke Kennard or Reggie Jackson, so we had to make an adjustment from the last round."""
Only difference is that Game 6 will be the Luke Kennard game instead of the Terance Mann game.
Luke Kennard with any space never misses
Is Luke Kennard Stephen Curry?
Luke Kennard has the saddest hairline I’ve ever seen on a 24 year old.
"This series should be great. Even though the best player is injured I still expect to all the games to be competitive and fiery. Very interested to see who steps up for the Clippers, real chance for PG to assert his greatness or another player like Mann or Morris to have a few historic nights. Keep your eye on Luke Kennard too. But aslong as CP3 is healthy I can’t see an upset without Kawhi.   Suns in 6."
Everything was looking great for us then they put in Luke Kennard who became mvp steph and buried us
Luke Kennard is gonna get absolutely abused by Booker during his minutes lol.
I expect to see a lot of Luke Kennard.  We just had the Terance Mann game.  What we need now is the Luke Kennard game.
"Let's show some love to my boy Luke kennard, he's come up good when called upon"
What we need now is a random 40pt pop off from Luke Kennard.
"If they beat the Suns they win it all.   Suns have a deep rotation and I find that there is no ""bad player"" in their rotation.  Clippers have Nic Batum (who is inconsistent at times), Luke Kennard (BBQ chicken), Terance Mann (rookie)"
His team has to play 4-on-5 offense while opponents can play extreme-offense lineups since even Reggie Jackson or Luke Kennard can shut down Gobert on the other end.
"Luke kennard, guy looks like hes fresh out of a frat house tryna sell you oregano as weed"
"Ingles, Luke Kennard, Draymond, and Caruso"
Fucking Luke Kennard still gives me nightmares
"luke kennard and reggie jackson the real mvp's, gave mann the confidence and team energy they didn't have last season.  They got that detroit grindtime mentality and they ballin' with ty lue."
"I was making a comparison with seth and steph's defense, but yeah. Steph has good help defense and I actually would argue that he's a more than average defender. Same goes for Seth, though. MITWestbrook complained about Seth's defense but Seth picking Trae's pockets actually gave them enough space to win the game handily.   People keep talking about the Curry bros' defense as if they're Luke Kennard levels but that's just disingenuous. You're forgetting Steph was a STL leader for the 2015-2016 season."
And Luke Kennard
"I've found it so calming whenever we're down. Clips down by double digits, I'm sweating, camera cuts to Ty Lue looking like he's waiting for the bus, I'm at peace, then like Luke Kennard suddenly hits three threes."
Kawhi didn't play. I think you mistaken Luke Kennard for him on the stat sheet.
Luke Kennard had 9 minutes
"Yeah, y'all have Fred VanVleet by committee: Reggie Jackson, Terance Mann, Nic Batum, and some Luke Kennard."
Notice how this utah fan didn't mention luke kennard.... you know why
mann the new kawhi. except luke kennard every clipper is elite
Luke Kennard is laying an egg.
Luke Kennard was drafted right before Mitchell
"Pfft, this nerd doesn’t know that I’m actually luke kennard"
Luke Kennard looks like he belongs on the PGA tour
He's like super Luke Kennard for half the price. Shit is ridiculous.
The reverse Budenholzer. Literally gave Luke Kennard significant playoff minutes after DNPs in the regular season. He does not give a fuck.
"I think you guys are fine with Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, and Mann. Just need to manage their rotations well."
Luke Kennard isn't injured?
"I know this is coming from a Clippers fan, but the league, media, and fans need to embrace load management.  The league now allows 17 men on a roster, use them.  Just be strategic about when.  Clips are playing at Orlando at 4:30 on a tuesday, I want to see if Luke Kennard can lead a group with our 10-12th guy.  The media makes it out to be a bigger thing that it is.  I think soccer does it, but from my understanding they get paid per game.  I dunno, maybe frame it in their contracts like incentives.  Play X games get $Y, play A games get $B."
I mean bogie had worse production than Fournier and he got 18m from the hawks last summer. Luke kennard got 16m from the clips.
"&gt;But come $10m sitting on the bench is not the best.  10M for a player who was healthy all year and averaged 13 ppg on 62% shooting sounds like a great deal. Much bette than what, 30 games that Ibaka played this year?  Harrell has probably played more minutes in this series than Ibaka has against the Mavs.   If you can sign a player for 10M who’s going to be that useful during the regular season and then not play during the playoffs in large part because you don’t have a need for them in your rotation, that’s not bad.   Look at how much Luke Kennard is being paid."
Example A: Oladipo. Should have taken the extension. Look at Luke Kennard. He’s making money DNPing playoff games.
Never underestimate the heart of general managers of the NBA. They bleeding hearts of spending. Just ask Luke Kennard.
Long as he keeps playing better than that Luke Kennard disaster
"A lot less than r/nba is going to say.  Either the Celtics will hold onto him or find a team that's still interested. It's not going to be a huge package to dump him.    The Clippers for example are desperate for a PG and they're about to pay Luke Kennard 15m/y to barely play. They would 100% gamble on Kennard + another piece for Kemba and hope he comes good again.  I think his market value will surprise people. Fans are very quick to write players off, but teams really do go to crazy lengths for the chance of acquiring star talent."
Luke kennard. Making $64M to sit courtside and watch the best players in the world is my idea of the American Dream
Saving Luke Kennard for the best might be his secret play
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
"I’m sure Rich Paul would love to take Luke Kennard, Myers Lennard, and Plumlee to replace AD and Lebron for equal racial opportunity"
Is Luke Kennard a 100%?
I'm happy Luke Kennard is not DNP this game and has a better plus minus than Bev. lol
Wtf they finally put in Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard is a good player and needs minutes
"Luke ""drafted ahead of Mitchell"" Kennard"
Luke Kennard let it fly baby
LUKE KENNARD IS ALIVE
I'm really hoping we get Luke Kennard minutes
Luke Kennard
We better see Luke Kennard tonight.
the real reason Ty Lue hasn't been giving Luke Kennard minutes is he caught him posting on r/relationship_advice
Oh i thought you were going to say Luke Kennard
"Burying this comment here for posterity.  My suspicion is that the Clips gave Luke Kennard the extension because they needed a tradeable contract down the road.  The Clips are over the cap.  They're limited in the ways that they can acquire significant talent.  One way is to take on other team's unwanted contracts like they did with Rondo.  You need tradeable contracts for that.  One example of a move that could be made possible by Kennard's contract is Patrick Beverley, Luke Kennard, and the player taken with the 25th pick in the 2021 draft for Al Horford.  The salaries match.  There's a chance the Clips won't have Nic Batum and/or Serge Ibaka next season.  Both can become unrestricted free agents after this season and Serge could possibly miss time due to his health.  Al Horford could slot in neatly as a PF/C who could start or come off the bench at either position, provide shooting, passing, and defense.  The structure of Kennard's contract and the incentive language basically makes it a 3 year $43 mil contract for a team like OKC.  It's not that bad for player who can get his own shot and hit over 40% of his 3s as long as you don't need him to play defense.  His defensive limitations make him a bad fit for teams with championship aspirations but he's a good fit for a rebuilding team that doesn't expect to make deep playoff runs right away."
"Luke Kennard is only guaranteed  40 mil over then next 3 years. Buddy Hield at 24 mil, Oladipo at 21 mil, and Gary Harris at 19 mil are guys with larger contracts. Give me Gary Harris on this one."
Luke kennard gotta be the SG
"Thanks a lot.. Raja Bell was one hell of a defender. Respect to the Jazz, who have such a great system where guys fit in their roles, and are always winning, whether it was the late Jerry Sloan or Quinn Snyder.. After Shaq said something about Mitchell not having enough triple-doubles (or at least compared to guys like Westbrook), he should at least know it's not their system to have one guy dominate the ball, and Donovan plays both positions, but more importantly, everyone touches the ball (to make the defense work, scramble, tire out) so no one guy is going to dominate assist numbers. I'm still upset my Pistons selected Luke Kennard over Donovan :)"
Bryn Forbes is going to get that Luke Kennard bag this summer
"So you're telling me next year the clippers will pay this dude and luke kennard arround 30 mil combined, yeah kawhi gone"
Luke Kennard
"Luke Kennard is a good player and can be their version of Joe Harris, but they don't use him."
"We’re paying Luke Kennard 16MM to sit on the bench, while being one of our best shooters"
Luke “DNP” Kennard would like a word
Luke Kennard another DNP.
"Luke Kennard with the best contract in the nba (3 year / $41,236,364) while on the DNP status for 3 straight games is absolute living the life."
Luke Kennard helped Paul George up he is contributing dammit
They also need a playmaking guard.... like Luke Kennard maybe?
Clippers need a role player that makes 3s maybe a guy like Luke Kennard
PG/Kawhi needs to average at least 70 together to even have a shot at competing.  Remember Luke Kennard? LOL
Where is Luke Kennard?
Luke Kennard Center time
That’s almost Luke Kennard money!
lol are you somehow implying that the existence of the super msx leads to average players being underpaid?  ask luke kennard how he feels about his contract
Idea of trading Paul George sounds great until you realize they wouldn’t actually get anything that would improve their roster. 31 year old on a big contract whom teams know you are trading out of desperation yeah all that’s doing is getting you back a bunch of worse players where the sum won’t be greater than the parts  They really are just kind of stuck. Used up their last remaining assets for the right to overpay Marcus Morris in that hilariously bad deal and to make luke Kennard a $41 mil bench warmer. Terrence Mann is cool but he’s not driving any trade packages not even close
Larry Bird in the stands like “That was God disguised as Michael Jordan disguised as Luke Kennard.”
Hoping for defense from Luke Kennard will end in complete misery
"Dude, you have been following me around all day commenting on my posts because you're upset I thought [your idea that the Bucks should trade Connaughton, DiVincenzo, and Portis for Luke Kennard was a bad one.](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nl98f2/the_clippers_paid_luke_kennard_64_million_to_get/gzk7men/) Let it go, man."
"How many white players are in the nba in general, and white stars in general. If someone is heckling a player, they're going after stars for the reaction. They're gonna go after kawhi and PG not luke kennard who can't get off the bench. It's really not that deep. Like I said tho, you're legitimately insane, seek help"
At least Bertrans had a decent Game One.  Luke Kennard and Derrick Jones Jr went from starting games earlier this year to being out of the rotation for the ending of the season and playoffs. Either of them are up for LIP.
"Derrick Jones Jr.  Got a 2yr/$18 million contract from the Blazers and went from starting 43 games earlier this season to now being completely out of the rotation in the playoffs.  Luke Kennard and Montrez Harrell also get consideration, but they weren’t expected to start."
This and Luke Kennard
I'm just going to put this here for future reference  Luke Kennard salary  * '21 $5.3 mil * '22 $12.7 mil base salary + $1.1 mil reachable incentives * '23 $13.7 mil base salary + $1.1 mil reachable incentives * '24 $14.8 mil base salary + $1.1 mil reachable incentives * '25 team option  likely total 4 years $49.8 mil
You would trade all three of those guys for Luke Kennard? That's what it would take to make the salaries match. Personally I think the Bucks fanbase would riot if they did a 3 for 1 trade like that of three rotation players for a guy who's getting DNP-CDs on a team that's about to lose in the 1st round. Go float that trade idea in the Bucks sub and see how well it goes over.
He’s already making Luke Kennard money thanks to the Knicks old FO
Man's earning himself a bag the way he's been the past couple seasons. At minimum Luke Kennard money.
"I agree, who cares if they are down 2-0. Luke Kennard bout to drop a 50 piece while holding Luka to 21% shooting"
Ok... so those teams have lebron.. Clippers have Luke Kennard
"Ah yeah, Luke kennard ended the first quarter as the leading scorer in the game. As we all thought."
I don't trust anyone on either team right now not named Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard leading the clips scoring as we all expected
Luke Kennard showing everyone he ain't Chandler Parsons 2.0
Only Luke Kennard is allowed to make 3s in this game.
Its the Luke Kennard show as we all predicted
Where is all your Luke Kennard slander now?
Luke Kennard can’t win with these cats
"Both teams are shooting awful, clippers lucky Luke Kennard a g"
Are Luke kennard and shake Milton the same person
Utah really losing to Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard seriously.
LUKE KENNARD AGAIN
Luke Kennard the hero Ty Lue groomed late in the Mavs series.
Luke Kennard earning that salary as we joke
#YALL WANTED LUKE KENNARD
Luke Kennard was tired of all the slander lol
"As everyone expected, the best player in the series is taking over: Luke Kennard"

Luke Kennard is out scoring our whole team
"Luke Kennard, playoff hero"
The Luke Kennard Game
luke kennard
Yoooo Luke Kennard minutes
"So that’s why we were resting luke kennard all season, it worked!"
just rebuild around Luke Kennard and you'll be set for the next 10 years.
You mean you don't want Luke Kennard and Marcus Morris in exchange for your top 10 player?
I totally agree I love Shamet but at the time the trade was made there were columnists like Kevin Pelton that argued Shamet was the worst player in the three team trade. There was plenty of argument over Luke Kennard being the player the Nets should’ve taken for that pick but in hindsight the bet on the fit of Shamet within the construct of the Nets roster at the time was one I’m happy with.
I thought Luke Kennard came up huge with with big run at the end of third.
"In 2017-18, the Pistons were 27-18 when Reggie was healthy and 12-25 during a rather long stretch when he was injured. They were 4-12 in the games between Reggie getting injured and trading for Blake.  Drummond was putting up 16 rebounds per game. Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver were 2nd and 7th in the league in 3 point percentage, respectively. Luke Kennard looked like a promising role player as a rookie.  Ish Smith was good off the bench but far from ideal as a starter. And Dwight Buycks always had good energy off the bench but he just wasn't that good - he hadn't played in the NBA for nearly three years when he became our primary backup PG and he hasn't played in the NBA since. That gap at point hurt us A LOT.  I still think that team would've been good had they been able to stay healthy. Nothing spectacular but at least win a playoff series. That was my sixth straight season going to at least 10 games and definitely the most fun that I had. Blake did outstanding the next year but I also felt like they focused on going iso with him way too much and made Jackson's role almost feel irrelevant. I think a lot of it though had to do with a relatively new owner in Gores (total douche, for the record), who had just moved the team from Auburn Hills to Detroit, being more focused on the image and appeal of getting a superstar like Blake on the team.  Overly long response, but once I got going it just flowed."
isaac being left off yet Luke Kennard and Kuzma are here is ridiculous.
"If Porzingis were 6-feet-anything he'd be working a 9-5 😂   Porzingis is a 7'3"" shooting guard who can't make a jumper 😂   8-27 (29%) from 3 this series 🥶   Averaged 5.4 rebounds per game this series 😤   I swear I never once saw him post up, in fact the only play I remember from him was jacking up a 3 on Luke Kennard on a fastbreak... CLANK"
"Dude has plenty of opportunities to attack the rim. Could be a mental thing from injuries but he doesn’t do it as often. It’s insane to blame the coaching staff.  He took a pull up 3 on a 2 on 1 fastbreak vs Luke Kennard FFS. You honestly think the coaching staff is telling him to shoot that?   Until he’s okay with getting physical again, doesn’t even need to be post ups, he’s going to be shit no matter where he plays"
Luke “Goes Hard in the Paint” Kennard
It's more hilarious to remember that the single defender on that break was Luke Kennard lmao
"The funny part is that after the game 5, some people was bashing the hell out of Luke Kennard for doing absolutely nothing and get paid millions. I think now they’d be more relaxed."
"Credit to Lue for identifying and fixing his lineup mistakes before it cost him the series.  Pat Bev and Zu were benched quickly when they became obvious liabilities and -despite being acquired specifically for a playoff run- I'm glad he recognized how little Rondo was bringing to the table this series.  I questioned his decision to give Reggie Jackson a lot of minutes when he was being hunted on defense, but he came through with a big Game 6 and hit a couple of huge bail out shots in Game 7.  His shot selection has been very questionable at times, but he's proven to be a valuable outlet option when Kawhi is getting aggressively double teamed.  Luke Kennard -who came up big this game- figures to be nothing more than a fringe rotation guy as long as Lue prefers Reggie's offensive contributions.  However, Terance Mann should absolutely be given some serious burn starting from the first game of the Jazz series."
"I have some good friends that are close to sources with the clippers. One of them told me Luke kennard would keep skipping practice to go fishing, and one day he started showing up with a live fish to each practice. Each practice he would put a ring into the fishes mouths and walk up to Ty Lue and make the fish spit out the ring onto the ground then stare Ty Lue straight in the eye while he took a bite out of the live fish, throw it on the floor, and step over it while screaming ""AI SHOW EM"" over and over.   This went on for about 13 practices."
"Shoutout to Luke Legend. Kennard went out there and balled out for the W. 4 years, $64 million not looking too bad right about now"
Timmy saw Luke Kennard guarding him and got a little too excited lol
"I'm sorry, Luke kennard."
Luke Kennard
"For sure , luke kennard is better"
"Yeh Terrence Mann and Luke Kennard are better than Luka cos they won right. Dumb NBA players, just forgetting to win! Gotta let them know bro"
Yeah but not when you have a Luke Kennard on you
Luke Kennard actually plays and clippers win What a coincidence
There's our monthly quota for a good Luke Kennard game.
Is Luke Kennard the next Larry bird?!?
"Good show, Luke Kennard  Homie needs to keep making 3s next series"
"He's a player coach obviously, any adjustments were made by *checks notes* Kenny Atkinson or Brendan O' Connor.  In fact, my theory is the real reason Luke Kennard racked up DNPs was because he was the one behind the scenes concocting the masterpiece adjustments while Ty Lue sat there dumbfounded with a ring in his mouth"
"Benching Beverley, barely playing Rondo in Game 7 and playing Luke Kennard is why Ty Lue has a championship."
Lakers really tanked to avoid Luke Kennard in the playoffs
The man put in two young guys who barely played this series and gave them minutes in key situations and they were ready cause he gave them his trust during the regular season. Those Terance Mann and Luke Kennard minutes swung the game
It’s crazy ty lue unleashed our secret weapon Luke kennard.
"Clippers have the white Doncic, Luke Kennard, we good."
luke kennard and dame? that’s a scary sight right there
"when Luke Kennard plays, Clippers win"
"""should Luke Kennard fire his agent for not getting him a bigger contract?"""
Luke Kennard should definitely play over Rondo. He spaces the floor for PG and Kawhi to operate.  Dallas was collapsing the paint and daring Rondo to shoot every time.
"Luke ""Quality Minutes"" Kennard"
"The flak ya’ll get for players leaving is so fuckin dumb.  In both football and basketball, DET rides and dies for their guys. Only saw well wishes from Detroit fans for Luke Kennard, Reggie, Tobias/Boban, and now, in the NFL, Stafford.  But dumbasses will keep making dumb comments"
Luke Kennard heard /r/nba talking shit
Luke kennard was big! He hit back to back threes.
&gt; Luke Kennard outscored the entire Mavs team during that span  That's our 3 years/ $45 million man.
Friendship ended with Luka Doncic  Now Luke Kennard is my best friend
I'd like to see a player like Luke Kennard go up to Luka after the game and dap him up and hug and him and put his hand on the back of his head and tell him to keep his head up and keep doing what he needs to do and then offer to trade jerseys
"Come on NBA writers, using Terance Mann and Luke Kennard is deus ex machina"
#KAWHI STEPPED UP  #PAUL GEORGE STEPPED UP  #TERANCE MANN STEPPED UP  #LUKE KENNARD STEPPED UP  #MARCUS MORRIS SR STEPPED UP  #BATUM STEPPED UP  #REGGIE JACKSON STEPPED UP
"With 6:41 to go in the 3rd quarter, the Mavs had a 5-point lead. Over the next 10 minutes, they shot 3-17 from the floor, 0-6 from 3, missed both of their free throw attempts, had 3 turnovers and got outscored 32-6.   **Luke Kennard outscored the entire Mavs team during that span.** The Mavs tried to make a comeback but the hole was too big to dig out of. Man I feel sad right now. 😞"
Luke Kennard should definitely request a pay rise this offseason.
"KP hasn't been the player he was even last year this entire year. I went into this series thinking it would be Hardaway #2 for sure.  Butler had a bad series but obviously he's still #1, Randle just missed looks, Porzingis was giving up rebounds to Paul George and getting beaten at the rim by Luke Kennard. He's a non factor. Dude played like Rip Hamilton at both ends this series, that's not just your shots not going in"
Look at luke kennard with a cool 11 points lmaooo so inspirational.
"Imagine going to game 7 and getting beat by Reggie Jackson, Luke Kennard, and Terrance Mann. That’s gotta sting."
"Never thought I would say this, but Get Luke Kennard back in the game."
"Luke Kennard +14 in 13 minutes, clearly he was the secret weapon"
Luke Kennard goddamn...
Thankful for Luke Kennard
Luke Kennard +17  Luka -12  Wonder bread boy.

It took a Luke kennard floater in the 4th to get your only 2 bench points of the game. That’s almost unheard of.
"Just got cold. We’ve had many games like this throughout the season. Also, with injuries, the other guys had to step up and play entire games. They were playing much more regularly than they are now. Reggie got his groove back because he played more minutes in this series. Mook has been hot and cold but is doing well defensively. I’m sure Ty played Luke Kennard last game so he could utilize him this game as well."
And unsign Luke Kennard? Dude got paid!!! To be fair they didn’t even use him in the playoffs to even see if he’s worth it lol
Luke Kennard getting paid 64 million in the next 4 years btw.
Luke kennard.
nah it was Luke Kennard
Luke kennard
Let’s be honest though Kawhi was just a side show to the real attraction tonight: Luke Kennard
Luka Kennard    Luke Doncic
Lillard has McCollum &amp; Nurcic. Booker has Chris Paul &amp; Ayton. Kawhi has Paul George &amp; one of the best in the game in Luke Kennard. Luka has THJ &amp; Zingis? Luka has to go superhuman to win game 7...or pray that Luke Kennard gets hurt.
literally nothing about this series has made any rational sense. why should Luke Kennard?
Luke kennard has been unleashed.
 Luke Kennard heard you guys talking shit and went off for a grand total of *2* points on 1-4 shooting.
"Ex Pistons. Reggie J, Luke Kennard, Morris sr, Boban. Even Tim Hardaway Sr was our assistant. 🤣"

"Clippers honestly what is your team? 0 depth beyond 3 players and even those guys have the occasion awful game. Then you have Luke Kennard, Cousins, Pat Bev that offer absolutely nothing"
Actually could the lakers trade for luke kennard? Not like the clips r using him anyway
Clippers could have signed a nice PG but instead gave Luke Kennard 20 Million to be a cheerleader
A tall luke kennard
"I think Clippers should go for him. Kemba still has value and de Clippers need a good pg (point guard, not paul george althoug a good paul george also wouldnt hurt) and could trade luke kennard which would be maybe a better fit in Boston."
They signed Kennard for 64m if I’m not mistaken  one could argue that Trez would have played more minutes than Luke these playoffs
"Watch my Clips sign him.  I like Luke Kennard, but that was a lot of money"
Monte makes less than both Kuzma and Luke Kennard. There are some dumb ass GMs in this league
Such a shame that Luke Kennard money replaced Mozgov money
my word that's even better than Luke Kennard money
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
Bogdan Bogdanovic is the good version of Luke Kennard and what people wanted Kennard to be in LAC
And Luke Kennard.
Luke Kennard?
luke kennard looks like someone mark zuckerberg stole the idea for facebook from
Serge Ibaka be cooking donkey dick for Luke Kennard on next episode of how hungry are you
Man I wish I was Kemba Walker or Luke Kennard or Porzingis. Money for nothing and chicks for free
Fuck. I want to be Luke Kennard so bad. Drive your value up in a tanking team then just watch courtside playoff games.
Luke Kennard has to be the worst FA signing of the past few years
Luke Mr.4/64 million Kennard   The new Chandler Parsons
While they have two really good stars. They’ve made some extremely questionable decisions filling out this roster. Throwing money at Marcus Morris and Luke Kennard most notably. Just doesn’t really make sense
Has Luke Kennard played yet this series?
Get Luke kennard out there and you'll have yourself a squad
"Can a Clippers fan explain why Luke Kennard isn’t getting any minutes? It’s not like your guards are playing any defence anyways, he’d bring much needed playmaking and shooting"
Luka reminds me of luke kennard. idk why the clippers dont play him.
Hack-a-Luka.  You will find some use for Luke Kennard.
