Rajon Rondo tonight - 15 points on 5/8 from the field 3/4 from 3 and 9 assists in 19 minutes
This is one hell of a performance by Rajon Rondo.
I forgot rajon rondo is also on the clippers

I heard one of them has a rajon rondo.
I would have said Rajon Rondo for the majority of the season but he's the Clippers problem now.   Maybe Solomon Hill because people think he still has something in the tank even though he's been absolutely miserable to watch play.
"Don’t know about most iconic, but in the past year or two the best one has to be the Rajon Rondo one with his kid post finals win when he’s holding the championship"
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
"Well, maybe Aaron Nelson's staff can get him right. But side note, if we're trying to collect players that will invariably piss Rajon Rondo/Anthony Davis/DeMarcus Cousins (I think IT and Cousins are cool with each other) off, we need to go hog wild and get Chris Paul.         Also, wonder if any of the ex-Lakers who were his teammates in Los Angeles, vouched for him."
One. Lebron  Sixteen infinities in a row  Two. Chris Paul  Three. Rajon Rondo  Four. Kyle Lowry  Five. Marc Gasol
His value is kind of low because of his injuries but I've been advocating for a PatBev-Eric Bledsoe swap for a while; sort of a sell-low for both parties.  The Clippers need a proper point guard and have extremely limited assets (as shown by the fact that they were only able to get Rajon Rondo for Lou Williams). Bledsoe can't shoot for shit but he'd only be there to make plays (remember he averaged 6 assists a game in the playoffs last year) and play defense. Hopefully Ibaka being a stretch-5 counteracts the lack of shooting.  The Pels get rid of a logjam in their backcourt while getting a guy that helps space the floor (PatBev is like a career 40% shooter from 3) who fits really well next to Lonzo.
"&gt;Duncan is a signficantly more impactful defender than Bowen was so his argument has zero basis  The DPOY voters in 2004 would disagree, since they gave far more votes to Bowen than to Duncan.  They did it again in 2005, with Bowen finishing second -- better than Duncan ever finished.  Bowen finished second again in 2006.  Still better than Duncan, ever.  Duncan finished 6th, just ahead of Shawn Marion.  Bowen -- now age 35 -- finished second still another time in 2007.  Duncan had a career-best 3rd-place finish.  2008, 36-year-old Bowen still beating Duncan, 4th to 9th.  2009, Bowen finally takes it easy and allows Duncan to lead the Spurs in DPOY voting for the first time since 2003, and 3rd time overall -- at 11th, behind Chris 'Birdman' Andersen and Rajon Rondo.  2010, Duncan again leads the Spurs in DPOY voting, and narrowly misses finally winning, finishing 14th with 7 total points.  2011 finds Duncan in 17th behind Luol Deng, Chuck Hayes, and other notables.  2012 no one votes for Duncan.  2013 Duncan's last stand, finished 6th just ahead of Larry Sanders.  2014 Duncan drops back to 13th.  Leonard is 11th.  2015 Duncan edges Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for 8th.  Leonard wins.  2016 Leonard wins again, no one votes for Duncan.  &amp;#x200B;  There's a very strong argument that Duncan is no better than the 4th-best defense player in San Antonio history, and DPOY voters seem to agree."
Rajon Rondo
"You're really out here trying to say that a team who had:  Dwight howard force his way there via trade  signed Steve Nash and Lebron James in free agency  and had even more players try to force their way there like Chris Paul ""haven't had interest from stars? lol  Ok, you say that's too recent, let's go back farther and look at a few free agent signings:  - Rajon Rondo  - KCP  - Derek Fisher  - Ron Artest  - Horace Grant  - Karl Malone  - Gary Payton  - Mitch Richmond   - Ron Harper  - Rick Fox  - Shaq  - Magic Johnson  is 30 years enough or should we go farther?"
"IIRC, Rudy Gobert was the last time a first rounder was sold for cash. I think it happened with the rights to Rajon Rondo as well."
"Exactly, and somehow the Clippers having to pay more than the Nets for players at the deadline supports the idea of big market teams are getting better players for less?   &gt;The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo   Do they know the Clippers are in LA?"
"&gt; “This is creating a competitive advantage for the large, destination markets,” says the first team exec. “And it’s another inequity for the small markets.”  &gt; **The Clippers** had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  &gt; **The Sixers** traded players and picks to get George Hill.  Yeah, poor small markets *Los Angeles* and *Philadelphia*"
"This is much ado about nothing.  The buyout market favors GOOD contending teams.  It has no extra incentive for players to go to big markets than they normally would as free agents.  The small-market execs might as well be complaining about how their smaller city doesn't offer the same kind of nightlife and business opportunities as LA, NY, or Chicago.  This is the typical small market whining spun to make it seem like a new argument when its not.    Beck's writeup takes liberties with what is considered a big market because it doesn't help his argument.  He begins that paragraph with ""Other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week."" as if switching the focus to ""other contenders"" isn't supposed to support the main point that small markets are being hurt.  The word ""small"" appears 10 times in his article, and is ALWAYS referencing the size of the market.  The word ""contender/contending"" appears 6 times, with 5 of those times directly used as a synonym for ""big market"" teams instead of simply a stand-in for ""good"" teams.  Its a bait-and-switch, he's throwing in ""contender/contending"" to make it seem like the complaints are about contending teams as well when its in fact all about big markets.    And of the teams he listed like the Nuggets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, and Heat, 2 of them laughably not big markets, but they're in his list because it helps to prove his point AFTER he's got the reader already hooked on his point of view that big = contender.  Denver is a middling sized city (13th in city size, 16th in metro size) and the Bucks are 20th and 24th in city/metro.  They should not be lumped together with the other teams.  In fact, a more fair article would have them on *opposing* sides.  The paragraph should instead read:  &gt; ""Though other contenders had to work a little harder to strengthen their rosters last week, not all were big markets.  The Clippers had to give up Lou Williams, the three-time Sixth Man of the Year, to get Rajon Rondo.  The Sixers traded players and picks to get George Hill. The Heat traded players and draft considerations to get Victor Oladipo.  *However*, the Nuggets traded players and draft picks to get Aaron Gordon and the Bucks traded players and picks to get P.J. Tucker.""  This rewrite of his paragraph gives at least a cursory opposition view that not all big markets are benefiting, its the good teams, and that's by design and nobody's fault and not a problem.  But writing an article saying ""Nothing is wrong, everything is just fine"" doesn't draw clicks.  You know what would draw clicks though but probably get Beck blacklisted by half the NBA teams?  Writing about the real problem, which is that cheap/bad owners drive players away and destroy competitiveness.  If you want to talk about big vs. small market teams, why not bring up the fact that the Knicks haven't exactly been a robust destination in the buyout market cause they've sucked for 20 years?  How about part of this competitive balance being destroyed by a big market team in Houston?  Frittata got rid of anyone who mattered in Houston and drove away his best player because he's cheap and wouldn't pay guys.  Want more?  Paul George said himself that he recruited AD to Indiana but the Pacers owner didn't want to pay him, citing they're a small market.  You know what's not small about Herb Simon?  His $2.6 billion net worth.  You know who's considered a pauper by NBA owner standards?  Jeanie Buss, owner of the Lakers and valued at a mere $500 million.  In fact, the trust that her father set up splits the ownership between all 6 kids, so even though she's technically the owner, she owns only 1/6th of the Lakers not counting the AEG partial ownership, which is 27%.  So technically, she only owns 11% of the 66% percent the Buss siblings own.  Yet she'll spend money like its going out of style to make sure the Lakers are relevant.    If there is a problem with buyouts, then it is NOT a fight between big and small markets.  Its a fight between good and bad teams AS IT SHOULD BE, and a fight between owners willing to spend and owners not willing to spend AS IT SHOULD BE.  The unnamed small-market execs quoted in the article would do a lot better to bring their complaints up to their owners and tell them to open their wallets if they want talent.  Or these GMs should tell their owners to fire them and hire better GMs.  They won't do that though, and therein lies the real reason why this article was written."
"Generally true.  But I think there's also a non-zero chance that Aldridge (moreso than Blake) will significantly improve once he gets to the Nets.  Call it a version of the Batum phenomenon (and before that Diaw) or whatever happens to Rajon Rondo on national TV, but I wouldn't be shocked by a talented player regaining some effectiveness in a more limited role on a better team."
PG: Rajon Rondo SG: Monta Ellis SF: Chandler Parson PF: Dirk Nowitzki C:   Tyson Chandler
They got a huge starting centre upgrade with serge ibaka   They got a huge upgrade from Landry shamet to Luke Kennard  And they have a play off upgrade from lou Williams to rajon rondo   PG has also been playing amazing  Saying the clippers are the same is a casual take
He will be surrounded by all time greats like Kawhi and PG.    Also read up on this: https://www.nba.com/news/rajon-rondo-returns-form-bulls-hammer-celtics
"Celtics did the first superteam trio two years earlier though.  Ray Allen, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett in their prime (with a young Rajon Rondo)."
"It's because guys like this are the difference. Think Shaun Livingtston, David West, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo and the roles they played on chapmionship teams. No one is asking Blake to be Lob City Blake anymore, they're asking him to put up efficient minutes against teams' second rotation. And LMA can be dangerously efficient as well, especially playing alongside a facilitator like Harden"
"This take will be trashed by the sub but I think you're right. He's the Jazz' best player still. And even though his offense is very limited the Jazz are much better with him on the floor on both ends. Gobert's on/off per 100 paint the picture that he's very good for Utah's team offense, even though he's quite limited individually. And well defensively his value should be obvious. I think he at least deserves a spot between 6-10 on the KIA MVP ladder. When I wrote my comment regarding this a couple of days ago I checked other players in the past 10 years ranking between 7th and 10th and the list is the following:  &gt;Guys that placed somewhere between 7 and 10 in the past were Pascal Siakam, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, John Wall, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Al Jefferson, Tony Parker, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Love.  And among those players I believe Gobert is one of the very best."
"2011 where Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo and Deron Williams battle it out for top PG bragging rights"
"All time it is Rajon Rondo, Marcus Smart, Dennis Rodman, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan  A VERY small team, but all those guys have a ton of “edge” or whatever you want to call it"
"I can also provide examples of players who peak younger than that. Kevin Love, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Rajon Rondo.  You can say guys get injured but that doesn't allow you to dismiss them from the data set, that's a big part of why they fall off."
"https://imgur.com/sFETNUu  Vlade sold the farm to get more cap space to sign Rajon Rondo and Rudy Gay thinking that was enough to make the playoffs in the West. The two people the Kings got never played a minute in the NBA. The 2017 pick swap ended up happening as Kings dropped from 3rd pick to 5th pick.  Funniest part of all, there were reports Vlade didn't know what the Stretch Provision rule was. If he knew about it, he could have bypassed this entire trade."
Hinkie got 2 1sts from the Kings so Sacramento could dump salary &amp; open up cap space to sign what turned into Rajon Rondo &amp; Marco Bellinelli.  The Kings opened up a bunch of cap space only to get used as leverage for players to extract more $$$ out of other teams.
It's not Rajon Rondo loose.
Rajon Rondo won a championship in his second year.
" It's a joke. He had this to say about John Wall during his rookie year:  ""Let me tell you something: I'm a big believer, when it comes to quarterbacks and point guards. Who's your dad? Who's your dad? Because I like confrontational players, I don't like passive aggressive. Strong families equal strong leaders. Talent? Overrated. Leadership? Underrated. And you can say, well, Colin, can you just go out and say anything crazy and get people to e-mail. That's not the point. You wouldn't e-mail if I was an idiot, because you wouldn't listen to the show. You listen to the show because we make good points.  ""I simply have a different opinion than you do on John Wall. I like the character of Derek Fisher, the rebounding and distribution ability of Rajon Rondo, that's what I like. That's what I want from my point guards. You celebrate the assists more than the buckets.....I know he's great. So don't confuse [me saying] John Wall's no good. No, John Wall's an A+ talent. I don't think he's ever gonna be an A+ win-championships point guard."""
Rajon Rondo literally played the rest of the game after tearing his ALC
"Don't forget montrezl harrell, Kobe bryant, rajon rondo, and Kenyon Martin.  Also as a bonus carmello Anthony, he had to have said something when Jeremy was outshinning him"
"He was a score first guy coming into the league, but he showed both at the end of last year and in the g league bubble that he is at his best when he's looking to facilitate. Wanamaker isn't exactly Rajon Rondo either, Poole should be out there without Mannion as the PG running the 2nd unit"
"   Rajon ""I'mma shoot it"" Rondo"
That was an incident with Rajon Rondo and Bill Kennedy in 2016
"Yep, it absolutely is.  Rookie LMA got paid 4 mil a year while someone like Rajon Rondo (selected at #21) got paid 1 mil a year.  Seeing as how he was ranked the #16 high school player in 2004, he likely wouldn't have gone very high either, so it was the right gamble."
Famed poor playmaker Rajon Rondo
Yes... and stop what? I'm mostly referring to this Rondo incident anyways   https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/12/14/rajon-rondo-allegedly-berated-a-gay-referee-and-the-punishment-feels-too-soft/
"Are we doing it as hypothetical 2v2 pickup or as a duo with 3 supporting players? Because I think if it was 2v2 pickup I'd pick Rajon Rondo and Draymond Green , they would have superior BBIQ and out-think their opponents but physically be outmatched.  But if it was a duo carrying a team then there might be an argument against it."

Stop being hyperbolic. I must have missed those games where he played 1v5.  Bosh career: 20/8/2  KAT career: 25/11/4  KAT is a better player than Bosh was. Bosh was on more successful teams. Bosh isn't the better player *because* he was on better teams any more than Rajon Rondo is better than Stockton.

"After really watching him up close this season, he's legit got to be the greatest PG rebounder of all time.  Like yeah he obviously focuses on corralling uncontested boards more than most guards do, and sometimes floats into the paint at the cost of contesting shots. But even putting that aside, I see so many instances where he goes and grabs key rebounds in traffic that no other 6'3 PG would be able to get, so overall its an impressive skill in my eyes. I think Russell also has large hands for someone his height, like Jason Kidd or Rajon Rondo did too (both great rebounding PGs in their heyday) so thats got to be part of it also.  This was sort of a funny blooper from the other day:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n2xymj/highlight\_westbrook\_cant\_miss\_scoring\_even\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n2xymj/highlight_westbrook_cant_miss_scoring_even_when/)"
"I honestly think most people in this thread are overvaluting rebonds and assists. You have to remember that efficient volume scoring is the greatest asset to have in today NBA. I mean come on now! Player B is a fucking 10ppg scorer! OP did not mention is efficiently either, it's possible that our Rondo on steroids guy is barely shooting 40% from the field.  TLDR: I'm taking prime Steph Curry over Prime on steroids Rajon Rondo."
Rajon Rondo
"lmao this guy can't be serious. off the top of my head these PGs are all better than Lowry:   Kidd, Magic,  Nash, Steph, Parker, Zeke, Stockton, Oscar, Cousy, West, Westbrook, Paul, Irving, Billups, Frazier, Archibald, Johnson, Lillard.   That's 18 off the bat and that doesn't even include guys like Deron Williams, Derrick Rose, Rajon Rondo whom are all debatable imo. Lowry is at best top 20, but top 30 is more like it."
Ya'll forgot about Prime Rajon Rondo....
"Nobody at the barber shop is going to laugh at guys like Manu Ginobili, Chris Bosh, Pau Gasol, Klay Thompson, or Rajon Rondo if they come in and talk about winning championships.  Bogut wasn't talking about the Samaki Walkers of the league."

Imagine if they added DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo too
I used to put up stat lines like this in 2K with Rajon Rondo on the Celtics
"&gt;Michael Ray Richardson, Fat Lever and Rajon Rondo  Those guys were on a different level than Elfrid Payton and MCW."
"Did you ever stop to think about why those few in particular might be getting a ton of triple doubles, rather than the literal dozens of other ball handlers that are way better than Elfrid Payton? Why the likes of Michael Ray Richardson, Fat Lever and Rajon Rondo are way up there on all time lists despite many other guards of their eras being better?  Yeah a 50% decline in people who aren’t bigs grabbing bulk rebounds. That’s not a point in your favour. Non-bigs who could rebound well have always done so throughout league history. Wings littered the top of the RPG leaderboards throughout the 80s and 90s to a much higher degree than they do today. Anybody who was using their brain would look at two guards rebounding significantly more than any other guards, any small forwards and the vast majority of power forwards and go “Man, those two guards in particular must be very good rebounders” rather than “Oh guess the whole league’s fucked then”.  I actually just forgot you pulled out that bullshit talking point about assists but it’s barely worth mentioning anyway. People have been complaining about scorers handing out easy assists since at least the 80s, if not longer. It dogged Stockton in particular through his entire career.

"I agree. He’s average at scoring at best but he’s above average playmaker and a great defender. I’d liken him to something between Marcus Smart and Rajon Rondo. In between them in passing, defending, and probably a better rebounder than both."
Rajon Rondo is fucking special
Rajon Rondo is like the popsicle guy in Family Guy
“Ah shit here I go saving this teams ass again.” - Rajon Rondo probably
Rajon Rondo  Very underrated imo. Everyone knows about the big 3 in Boston but for a few seasons he was arguably their best player. He's also the craftiest player I've ever watched with his fakes and behind the back passes.
rajon rondo. Fuck that guy

Draymond is an incredible defender. Put he isn’t stopping PRIME DEMARCUS COUSINS who just happens to be paired with ANTHONY DAVIS and is being fed by notorious playoff performer RAJON RONDO
"Lmao yeah I remember the last shot in 2010, where a team with Ray Allen and Paul Pierce were forced to have Rajon Rondo take a three.  He was open and I don't think anyone broke a sweat."
Dwight was absolutely not the heart and soul of the team.  He was an amazing hype man for everyone as was Jared Dudley.  And he was big helping in the Denver series.  (and a huge factor in Lakers getting the #1 seed with helping regular season duties at the 5.)  But the dude on the bench who was game changing was Rajon Rondo.  That was the true heart and soul of the team outside Bron/AD.
I don’t understand people who want Wesbrook to play like Rajon Rondo
You forgot  Rajon Rondo- Chris Paul
"It’s ok, we have rajon “prime time, professional cp3 hater”rondo here for a reason."
"The guy went four straight years of his prime without winning a single playoff series. Ray Allen and KG could’ve been given that Finals MVP and nobody would’ve blinked an eye. Paul Pierce had a great game 5 (which they lost), but had absolute clunkers in game 3 and the closeout game 6. If you shoot 31% in the series clincher and get outscored by Rajon Fucking Rondo, your Finals MVP might be a little overrated. If you take out his one good game (a loss), he averaged 18.6 for the series... right above KG and more than 3 points behind Ray. That was as even of a big 3 as there was at the time, but Paul Pierce acts like he was head-and-shoulders above everybody else when he talks about his legacy. If he didn’t overrate himself so much, maybe less people would be inclined to shit on him. All of this “Lebron is lucky he didn’t come into the league when I did” and “I’m better than Dwyane Wade” shit post-retirement doesn’t do him any favors."
"After LeBron James, Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, and Jared Dudley made the 2020 NBA Finals the streak reached its 37th year."
"In 2009 vs. the Bulls in round 1, Rajon Rondo put up 19.4/9.3/11.6 with 2.7 steals per game.  That series was an absolute barn burner.   Then in 2010 he helped run Lebron out of Cleveland by slapping up 20.7/6.3/11.8  with 2 steals per game.  In game 4 of that series he went for 29/18/13 with 2 steals.   Playoff Rondo is a real thing."

"rajon rondo was putting triple doubles in the playoffs routinely in the beginnng of the 2010s and he’s one of the more well rounded players. it’s not a leap at all to say a guy who was already usually top 5 in triple doubles would be even higher   and chauncey made 3 All-NBA teams and did everything his teams needed of him. he played for some of the slowest teams in the league and he played with 3 elite rebounders in the Wallace’s and Prince. give him the open court and the missed 3’s and i bet he gets a ton more   point is, the league is way different and the days of lance stephenson leading the league with 5 triple doubles is over"
Title should have said “Here is one Rajon Rondo highlight”.  Have to mention they played a very poor defensive team.
Saying that Brook Lopez and Jrue Holiday are all-stars is like saying the Lakers had all-stars Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard last year.  By this logic DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin are all-stars for the Nets and they have 5 all-stars.
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
Rajon Rondo seems like such a little shit head......And I have no proof of it

"Clippers really have Patrick Beverly, Marcus Morris, Rajon Rondo, and Demarcus Cousins all on the same team"
"FWIW they have signed Dwyane Wade, Rajon Rondo, Pau Gasol, Carlos Boozer (sign and trade), Rip Hamilton since just 2012.  That's 5 all star level players in less than 10 seasons. Rip was 3 seasons removed from an ASG, and coming off a 14 PPG season, Pau would go on to have two ASGs in Chicago, Boozer was 2 seasons removed from his last ASG and would average 18 ppg his first year with Chicago. Wade was an all star the year before he signed with Chicago and would average 18+ ppg in Chicago. Rondo was 4 years removed from his last ASG, but just got done leading the league in APG. So really you had 3 true all star caliber players and 2 good/solid players that were coveted by a number of teams. Not bad for a 9 year span.  Then you've got all of the midlevel signings like Dunleavy who weren't all stars or 15 ppg guys but solid 10 ppg guys.  EDIT: I just noticed the Cabarkapa flair lmao, I remember bombing threes with him in 2K5."

"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"I agree. Telfair was as hyped as any player in the history of basketball when he was in the 8th/9th grade. However, everyone in his class caught up with him. By the time his senior year rolled around, he was no longer a top 5 recruit, and Rajon Rondo was running neck and neck with him as the best PG in his class - those aren't legendary expectations.  There's a simple reason for NYC producing fewer 5 star/blue-chippers. It's too expensive to live in the Tri-State, and African Americans have moved to the South and Southwest."
Isaiah Thomas and Isaiah Thomas   OR  Rajon Rondo and Rajon Rondo
"Have you heard of Rajon Rondo?   While on that Celtics roster he deserved to be on at least 2 all nba defensive teams.   He’s 6‘1 (ok, I understand his hands are almost as big as Kawhi‘s and he has a huge wingspan, but still, 6‘1!)."
And he made a grand total of 1 more shot the whole game. Dude gets a lot of hype for being Rajon rondo who scores less with better D.

"In the most recent examples, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo both (potential?) future HOFers nowhere near their primes obtaining a ring with the Lakers"
Rajon rondo called a ref that word a couple years ago iirc
"I think it’s a bit more complicated then that...Carlisle did not want Rondo in the first place, and Rajon being the incredibly perceptive person he is, lashed out in a normal way. I would be an asshole too, if I knew I wasn’t wanted somewhere. Also our championship core was gutted  by the time he arrived, and a rebuild was inevitable."
"Atlanta Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk proudly waited outside the visiting locker room to give Trae Young and the players on his victorious new look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward De’Andre Hunter yelled out “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Kevin Huerter gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Rajon Rondo yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Young hit the locker room door, former NBA great Dominique Wilkins hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
"Rajon Rondo destroyed it all when he quit against y'all in the playoffs. We had an outside chance at that series if ""playoff Rondo"" showed up. What a pipe dream that was"
"1. the choice is bad 2. the worst part being if the choice was made because of ""winning"" while the Pacers with Sabonis on the court have been worse than the Hawks with Trae, or the Heat with Bam, is Sabonis rewarded because the Pacers are good when he's looking on the bench because his back up isn't Rajon Rondo or Kelly Olynyk 3. If you want to use the winning argument, Middleton is a better player on a better team"
"Trae litterally has a better net rating than Sabonis, am I suppose to reward a guy because his team is better when he's on the bench while the other guy doesn't make it because his back ups are Rajon Rondo and Brandon Godwin ?"
"He murdered our team chemistry in 2015 and sent us the grumpiest possible version of Rajon Rondo in return, so I'll never forget that."
"It's also a weird situation because around 20010 when he came into the league it was a turning point for Point Guards and what teams were looking for in Point Guards.  He came in as a player with hype because most teams didn't neccesarily looked for a Point Guard who could score 20+ a game on super high efficiency. Guys like Steve Nash, Deron Williams, Chris Paul were an exception because they could do both (and even then CP3 and D-Will only had 2 20+ seasons)  The prototype for many teams were Rajon Rondo and Chris Paul, a guy that would get shitload of assists, and on defense preferably lock down the opposing Shooting Guard.  Then Steph Curry blew up, D-Rose became an MVP, Wall/Kyrie/Westbrook showed up in the league, and suddenly the ideal Point Guard became a scoring machine (again) who could get assists where needed.   Ricky never really stood a chance, and even with his injuries slowing him down he's always been a good Dime&amp;D player he was at the start. Except the shot never developed, and with the change in team priorities his fate was sealed."
Wtf are you talking about?  LeBron took the Lakers with the corpse of Rajon Rondo starting to a championship   This season’s roster is arguably much worse than last years roster and last year LeBron had some of the worst role players in the league.

**Rajon Rondo**  Because he sucks on my team
"It was incredible to watch Rajon Rondo in the playoffs last year. You could just see everything clicking in his brain, I don't know if he made a bad decision the entire run. From a guy who seemed like a potential liability at times during the regular season, he was near perfect and just dissecting teams like it was nothing."
"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. I remember a season where Brook Lopez was selected as an injury replacement for Rajon Rondo."
"Who you gonna call?!  Rajon Rondo!  Now being serious: imagine the quality of a basketball discussion between LeBron James and Rajon Rondo  Off the charts. I never read anything directly about it, but I believe LeBron must have the utmost respect for Rondo. Such a great mind of the game."
Gotta be Nik Stauskas (ok he sucks but he was out 8th pick at the time) + 2019 first overall pick (unprotected) for the cap space to sign rajon rondo for 1 season. We obviously still missed the playoffs and we lost a first rounder for no reason. But glad Rondo could use us to keep in the league lmao.
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol.

"Then explain Quinn Cook, Kyle Kuzma, KCP, Rajon Rondo, last year all getting more votes than players way way way better than them??  It's literally a popularity contest."
"**First year after drafting AD:**  Traded for Ryan Anderson  Matched the Suns offer for Eric Gordon  Traded for Robin Lopez  **Season 2:**  Traded Nerlens Noel and a 1st for Jrue Holiday  Traded for Tyreke Evans  **Season 3:**  Traded a 1st for Omer Asik  Traded for Quincy Pondexter and Norris Cole  **Season 4**  Re-signed Ajinca, Asik, and Dante Cunningham to long term deals  **Season 5**  Signed E'Twuan Moore  Signed Solomon Hill  Traded for Boogie and Omri Casspi  **Season 6**  Signed Rajon Rondo  Traded for Nikola Mirotic  **Season 7**  Signed Julius Randle  Signed Elfrid Payton  ----  Many of these were not successful for various reasons through injury or our coaching staff just mis-judging the potential a player had who then failed to reach it after a huge contract.  But we made shit tons of deals and signings to try to surround AD with people who the coaching staff thought would be contributors.  Saying ""Free Agents dont want to go there"" is the entirely wrong conclusion to draw."
Rajon rondo has been pretty bad this year
Rajon Rondo  Allen Iverson  Brandon Roy  Carmelo Anthony  Tim Duncan
Rajon Rondo Derrick Rose Jaylen Brown Jayson Tatum Kevin Garnett
"Carmelo Anthony, Ray Allen, Marc Gasol, Rajon Rondo."
"Another case of a shooting guard stuck in a point guards body.  The Bulls have lacked a playmaker at the 1 since.... what, Derrick Rose? Kirk Hinrich? Rajon Rondo?  However, guys like Lou Will, CJ McCollum, etc have carved out some big roles on solid teams.  I think Coby will have a role anywhere in the league as an instant offense type of player, but man him at the 1 is rough."
His passing is still elite and he's a great locker room guy. He could be the Rajon Rondo on a contender if he was willing to adapt.
Rajon Rondo has done next to nothing. He was injured part of the season but it seems like he doesn't even fit in as a backup facilitator on the Hawks. I think there are even rumors they'll trade him for a backup PG
You mean 2x champion rajon rondo
A Nasty Dime. Reason why Rajon Rondo is my all time favorite player and I can watch Jason Williams highlights for hours
"Pretty sure Knicks fans found that trade incredibly stupid and paraded when the front office who made that decision was removed and Rose/Wes came in and took over.   Every team who has a guy who forces out is going to be happy when that guy isn't playing well. Just imagine what you think when you hear the name Rajon Rondo, then imagine if he was supposed to be the future face of your franchise for 10+ years"
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
The Rajon Rondo revenge game /s
rajon rondo vs rick Carlisle let's goooooo
"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"Hey kids:  Blake was a really good dunker. Like really good.  Rajon Rondo was crazy smart/amazing passer and would do 4d chess shit.  Carmelo was a god teir scorer, would back down the defender and diabolically pick them apart with the triple threat  Steve Nash was incredible because he was an extremely accurate shooter and passer, any choice the defense chose was the wrong choice against Nash, it was beautiful"
Just like Ben Simmons was just a lightskin Lebron even though young Lebron who was a poor shooter was never afraid to let it fly. Still had many 40 and 50 point games just taking jumpers in his younger years. Ben Simmons plays like a 6'10 Rajon Rondo.

"Westbrook has shot 46 for 164 (28%) in the final 5 minutes of playoff games that were within 5 points, including 8 for 52 on threes.

"The funniest thing is when people say Lonzo's ""floor"" is Rajon Rondo and 'that's not good enough.' If he's Rondo, he's worth big money.  &gt;*We have, but Ball’s role will be different this time. I actually envision Ball as the sixth man on this Lakers team,* ***being a much better version of what Rajon Rondo was to last year’s Lakers.*** *He is undoubtedly a better defensive player, is a better shooter than Rondo and has showcased that he has generational passing ability.*  Rondo won you that Finals.  He said, *""Hey, let's just do to Jimmy what I do to Harden. Jimmy is the only guy who can playmake out there, here's how we'll stop him.""* Then you stopped Jimmy Butler.  He's known to be one of the smartest guys in the league--with a great BBIQ, so this idea of 'Rondo' as Lonzo's ""floor"" is too silly."
Jayson Rondo or Rajon Tatum?
"[heres that yip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lkf15ETxoU)  i feel kinda bad for russ. the way the ref throws him the ball like ""come on, this is a job"".. from watching the nets, every time KD has a problem with a call, the ref's hear him out. a privilege only those who are respected get.  russ must have felt like he lost an older brother when KD left okc's organization. and russ must have felt that he needed to show the press and people that he wasn't upset by the him leaving, and that he had to show strength. unfortunately, i think this resonated with him thruout his career. strength became ignorance.   to see an MVP argue with john wall, or rajon rondo.... *pshh, whatever...*  it makes you wish more and more that he would just get on a winning team and try to win one instead of trying to constantly prove a point with his entire nba career."
he just needs the IQ.  basketball iq is a skill that can be learned and improved.     taking good shots is part of that and taking care of the ball.    rajon rondo is a perfect example.
"I was expecting William rondo, not rajon rondo"

This is interesting.  So I decided to do some research.  The least amount of points scored by someone to get at least one MVP vote that season (in the 2010s) is... Rajon Rondo who in the 2010-11 season scored 10.6 PPG but finished 10th in MVP voting (probably like one 4th and a couple 5th place votes) thanks to 11.2 assists and 2.3 steals
"This. The best thing he can do is work on his shot. Even if he had defense and assists like Rajon Rondo, that's not enough to carry a team like DC and his future will be very murky."
"That athleticism is what made him an elite player. Now he's lost that, and you're throwing out an assist stat that really doesn't make up for his decline. He can still contribute, with assists, sure, but he isn't a Chris Paul or Rajon Rondo. He needs to contribute in other areas and he isn't yet. There is hope and this is a weird season esp in DC.   I was going to buy season tickets to watch him, and right now, that looks like a bad plan. Post-vaccine, I might anyway, just because I finally can."
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
Rajon rondo
"Doc Rivers is low key using Ben Simmons like a Rajon Rondo who can set screens.  Ben so far this year is averaging 12.2 points per game on 8 shots attempts a game while also getting about 8 assists a game. In the 2008-09 season Rajon had 11.9 points a game and 8.2 asts, only shooting instead of passing 9 times a game.  This is the first season that Ben has not averaged above ten shots attempts a game and I really do not think it is a coincidence that this is happening under the new coach Doc Rivers."
"I can only name one player I would have taken over Dwight in the next 3 drafts after his. And that is Chris Paul. I would also argue Dwight had a higher peak than Paul even if his downslide came earlier. These drafts included  LaMarcus Aldridge Chris Paul Brandon Roy Rajon Rondo  I'll even cheat and go one year ahead even tho you never defined what an ""era"" even meant. KD is thr first player in 4 drafts I easily go ""yeah I'd take him over Dwight easy"". I hate to say you're talking out your ass but it kind of seems like you are."
So Rajon Rondo or Carmelo?
"Udonis Haslem , Rudy gobert, Thad young , Jrue holiday, Rajon rondo , James Johnson"

" &gt;Rajon Rondo just shot 40% in a playoff run and he is an ass 3 point shooter  This isn't 2010 lol. He's not been an ass 3 point shooter for years now. He's pretty average on low volume.   Hell, he's had 3 seasons in the last 5 years shooting 36% or better."
"Yes it's normal  Rajon Rondo just shot 40% in a playoff run and he is an ass 3 point shooter, pretty good sample size too he took 3 a game   Playoffs are such small sample size that a lot of shit can happen, every year u have someone massively over performing and making people think they are that good so many examples throughout the years"
"&gt; Rajon Rondo was brought in to correct this kind of behavior. He will have zero problem telling him thats not how you win games.  lol Rondo, he is biggest whore there is. he (at least was, dunno about now) MAJOR assist whore. he's also shows up for playoffs only"
"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard’s BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo’s two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks’ high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
Or hear me out- he's selfish and a glory whore. Rajon Rondo was brought in to correct this kind of behavior.  He will have zero problem telling him thats not how you win games. Im interested to see if Young is handling these situations differently by the end of the season.
"[Disagree](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/02/01/young-bulls-rave-about-rajon-rondo-as-a-teammate/)  Rondo can be stubborn and pigheaded, but he can also be good off court. It's not as if he's always a huge saint though. It does take time to build meaningful bonds, though"

Unless your name is Rajon Rondo
"Is what boils down to a 6’10” Rajon Rondo gonna lead a team to the championship? (These days, Rondo isn’t half bad on offense)"
"the problem isnt that he doesnt care how many shots he takes. you can still be a very very effective offensive player even without taking a lotta shots. the problem is that he just isnt a scoring threat in the half court at all. his jumper is the least of his concerns. simmons, at his size, strength, and athleticism, should be a walking mismatch. if teams sag tf off him, he needs to see that as a an opportunity to get in the paint and score, but instead he usually sees it as ""okay time for me to pass""  the amount of teams that have won a ring where their point guard wasnt a playoff caliber scoring threat is 0. rajon fucking rondo is a bigger threat to score than ben, which is a major problem. hopefully doc rivers can fix it. bens still got plenty of time, if he can learn to be aggressive, he'd easily be a perennial all nba player. combined with his near dpoy level defense and thats a really fucking good player"

"Oh, yeah, almost certainly some fair-weather types in there. Meanwhile one of my first memories with being a fan of the team is the Carter trade. And since I'm not one to miss a chance to remind people how bad it was, a recap:  To Nets  * Vince Carter, averaged 23.6/5.6/4.7 in 374 games with the Nets, making three All-Star teams   To Raptors  * Alonzo Mourning, immediately released over health concerns * Eric Williams, averaged 4/2/1 in 62 games, then traded alongside Matt Bonner, a second and cash for Rasho Nesterovic * Aaron Williams, averaged 1.6/1.2/0.1 in 37 games, then traded for a pair of seconds (neither man ever played in the NBA) * Nets' 2005 first, used on Joey Graham, averaged 6.4/3.1/0.6 in 275 games, then left in free agency * Nuggets' 2006 first, traded alongside Jalen Rose for Antonio Davis, who played 8 games before suffering a season- and ultimately career-ending knee injury (pick used for Renaldo Balkman)  And you know what else is annoying is that the Nets pick could've been David Lee and the Nuggets pick could've been Rajon Rondo or Kyle Lowry (who I keep forgetting didn't actually start his career with the Raptors)."
"Hoiberg also never got the players he wanted, imagine giving a coach with a system based on shooting washed D-Wade, and Rajon Rondo to complement Jimmy Butler, who is also not a great 3pt shooter"
"so is rajon rondo better than all because he and the lakers won a lot last season? trae young is clearly the better player. the question is whos the better player not whose team is winning the most.  trae and the hawks literally almost beat the nets the other day and are 3-1 this season. id love to see what jamal murray could do in a team of damian jones, deandre bembry, 40 year old vince carter, and a bunch of rookies.   trae became an all star with that team. murrays with the way better team, has he ever been an all star? i mean wins over stats right?"
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
"I don’t think it’s probable anymore. The top 15 or so are all from back in the day with probably suspect assist numbers. Rajon Rondo only got 25 assist and he was the OG Ben Simmons  The way basketball is played now I don’t think allows this stat to really be contested. Russ might be the closest as I think he had 24 this year, but now he’s going to a team with LeBron and AD, so is he really gonna have the ball that much?"
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
"Chicago still is able to bring in all star caliber players. That's more than most other teams can say. Even if they aren't the LeBron/Durant tier players, they consistently have brought in All Star level guys since Jordan retired, despite being a middling franchise.  Anyone of Pau Gasol, Carlos Boozer, Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic (trade) and Ben Wallace were all coming off of all star seasons and/or were still all stars in Chicago. They aren't the premier FAs but they are still star players and anyone of these FAs would be one of the biggest FA signings for probably 15 other franchises. These guys are all within a \~10 year span too. Chicago is definitely in the tier 2 of FA destinations, alongside the Knicks and maybe the Celtics &amp; Rockets. With tier 1 being Miami, LA, Brooklyn, Golden State.  IMO:  * Tier 1: Team location is a major driving force to signing there * Tier 2: Team location helps, but current team status is also important * Tier 3: Team location doesn't help or hurt FA signing (i.e. Atlanta, Denver, Dallas etc...) * Tier 4: Team location hurts, but team success can negate it (i.e. San Antonio, Milwaukee) * Tier 5: Team location is a big detractor for FAs (Utah, OKC)"
Rudy Gobert would be the modern center equivalent. Guards have been so scoring dominant lately it’s tough.  Rajon Rondo is 4 time all defense and a steals champ. Not sure what his Vegas odds are on HOF.
"Andre Drummond(C), Kevin Love(PF), Ben Simmons(SF), Rajon Rondo(PG), Austin Rivers(SG)  This actually looks like a good team on paper."
Of course he has he achieved more than Maurice Cheeks who is a HOF player.  Basketball reference uses an algorithm to predict the odds &amp; he's got a 60% chance to join the HOF.   https://www.thecoldwire.com/is-rajon-rondo-a-hall-of-famer/
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"Do you think TJ McConell is physically gifted, or Joe Harris? How about Rajon Rondo? There's plenty guys out there that don't depend on genes to play in the league. The superstars and such, sure.  It's not just a physical gift, it is the work and effort and playing a role in a team."
"Smh, You haven't seen the videos of Ben Simmons practicing with sharp shooter Rajon Rondo?"
"Rajon Rondo is a 4 time all-star, 4 time all-defense, 3 time assists leader, steals leader and a two time champion. He hasn't been a star since leaving the Celtics but he was one of the premier point guards of the league for about a 6 year period. He's not gonna be first ballot I say there's a 90% chance that he makes it within 15 years of retirement."
I want this woth Rajon Rondo disguised as Chris Paul lol
"Can I interest you in Rajon Rondo, Kyle Anderson and Tyus Jones?"
If he helps you win you will probably love him eventually.  I rooted for Rajon Rondo ffs
"That's not even remotely the same situation. Rondo was sued, not arrested.  Rondo actually tried to break up the fight which was initiated by the other woman entering personal space during a pandemic. Then the other women kept talking and he backed up and let his GF fight her. But of course Rondo is the one she is suing for everything under the sun because he's a millionaire. The entire incident is on video and his lawyer says they are not settling for anything. If his lawyer is saying that with video of the entire event I'd be surprised if he lost. Seems like a blatant case of gold digging to me. The woman has claimed to be permanently disabled from a tiny woman punching and slapping her in the face a couple of times.

*Breaking News: Grizzlies have agreed to trade veteran guards Rajon Rondo and Patrick Beverly to the Los Angeles Clippers for cash considerations.*
"Well Memphis now has Rajon Rondo, so they will more than likely win a championship. The Rondo effect is real"
IJL Rajon Rondo still plays NBA basketball!
No. Ja is now on the trade market. This is due to the arrival of elite point guards Patrick Beverly and Ramon Rondo.   Ja Morant’s time in Memphis is finished and with this end comes the promise of new beginnings. What type of trade package can the Grizzlies net for Ja Morant? Will they have to buy the young guard out? How will Rajon and young big man Jaren Jackson Jr. mesh on the court? How many star players can Beverly maim and mutilate during his time in Memphis?
Rajon Rondo.
That's Rajon Rondo
"I was at Carbone, which is this pretty nice Italian restaurant. And next to me at the table, the table next to me was: Rajon Rondo, Patrick Beverley, and Daniel Oturu. And while I’m sitting at the table (a little bit more intoxicated than I should have been admittedly), the news that all three of these guys had been traded to Memphis drops. And seeing Patrick Beverley jump on top of the table, at a five star Italian restaurant, screaming at the top of his lungs “I JUST WON THE F-ING PLAY IN GAME!” Over and over and over again was enough to make me sick."
&gt;I would die for Rajon Rondo   Man if I told a 2013 Celtics fan that a Lakers flair would type that one day..
&gt;Rondo for a second back to the lakers might as well be a done deal  Not with Russ on the team.

"\[Wojnarowski\] The Los Angeles Clippers are trading Patrick Beverley, the next 3 years, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu to the Memphis Grizzlies for guard Eric Bledsoe, sources tell ESPN."
"The return is patrick beverly and rajon rondo. Those could both very well be viewed as positive or neutral value contracts. Plus they get to move Bledsoe, who's a very clear negative."
This allows Rajon Rondo to be bought out and come how to the Lakers. W
You think 21 year old rajon rondo was out there callin the shots? You think he was the one tellin the perenial all stars who were ten years older than him what to do? Lmao.
"This, hindsight makes it looks worse but at the time Rubio was a PG that teams salivated over because he fit the mold for what many thought was an ideal point guard.  Lockdown defender who could get absolute loads of assists and make the rest of the team better from his presence.  This is a league that just saw the Celtics win a chip with Rajon Rondo at the #1, or hell, Derek Fisher helping Kobe win two titles, and an old Jason Kidd being a big part in the Mavs winning their only title.  The idea of a point heavy PG wasn't popular, sure you had guys like Arenas and D-Will in the league, but their teams weren't producing title winning basketball.  Then in a few years you had the rise of guys like Curry, Kyrie, Wall, Westbrook, etc. who could drop insane points whilst still getting lots of assists, and just as quickly a PG like Rubio fell out of favour entirely.  But for a good 4-5 years in the mid-late 00s, Rubio was a dream PG.  It also doesn't help he got messed up from injuries, and of course never being able to develop his jumper."
"&gt;He opted to not bring back Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard after the Lakers won in 2020.  The Lakers could not afford to bring that team back, as most of them got raises to leave.  McGee made as much as Gasol and Howard combined in 2021.  Green made more then Schroder, and provided far less.  Rondo got a 325% raise from the Clippers.  Pelinka is not a great GM, but bringing back the 2020 Champs was never an option."
"Doc Rivers, De’Aaron Fox, Rajon Rondo, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kelly Oubre, Steve Nash, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Jaylen Brown, Lou Williams,  Chris Paul, John Wall, Ja Morant, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Jayson Tatum, JJ Redick, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, and Udonis Haslem have all been guests on their podcast.   Obviously not all of these people are going to be anti-Semitic (one would hope), but just the fact that Jackson’s podcast has access to such a wide variety of NBA talent that hasn’t been disrupted despite Jackson’s track record shows that the hate being shown towards Meyers Leonard is partially insincere and probably coming from people who aren’t actually Jewish themselves."
"I think people underrate how awful Ben Simmons really is. He's essentially Rajon Rondo but getting paid like LeBron, how does that make sense? He's not a leader, he can't create a shot or make a shot EVEN IF HE'S OPEN. He's trash 100%. Give any average player as much ball time as he gets and I bet they average more points and as many assists he gets."
"Why does your comment say ""Rajon Rondo is Rajon Rondo""? Is it a new meme I missed?"
Rajon Rondo is Franklin the turtle change my mind
"Unpopular opinion: I don't like Paul George entirely because of his hairline. It always creeps me out how little forehead he has but the worst thing is that it's only on TV, looking at pictures I always think I'm going insane as it's not as evident. On a similar note Rajon Rondo always looks like a video game character and he gives me uncanny valley vibes"
It'll always be funny to me how the Warriors changed the league in 2015 and won the title by killing teams with 3 pointers and then the very next offseason Garpax's big genius moves were to go out and get Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo.
You mean that clip of him shooting next to sharpshooter Rajon Rondo has no correlation with actual improvement for Ben??
"Naw not the same, they never won a ring with Shaq, the way we won one with Laker legend Rajon Rondo."

"No, no he didn't lmfao. Not unless you also consider Rajon Rondo to have shot like Ray Allen this past season as well lmao. You are completely disregarding volume, shot difficulty, and the fact that you're comparing one season to an 18 year career. It is absolutely disrespectful to imply that 1.4 makes per game on 3.3 attempts is anywhere near shooting like one of the best shooters of all time lol. Not to mention Allen is a career 90% FT shooter, while Bron shot 75% that year. Please stop making ridiculous claims based off a single stat."

I remember back by around 2012-2013 he had at least 3 incredible and memorable blocks on Rajon Rondo alone lol

I'm excluding rookie deal guys who have a team option next year because any team would be stupid to not pick up LaMelo or Garland's option.  James Harden (if declining player option)  Westbrook (if declining player option)  Kyrie (If declining player option)  Rozier  Dragic  Rubio  Beverly   Smart  Rajon Rondo  Sexton  So the 3 best realistic choices are Smart, Sexton, and Rozier"
Lol along with all-time great shooter Rajon Rondo.
"&gt; Rajon Rondo if he could shoot   So… one of the best point guards of all time, is what you’re saying?"
"RONDO?!?!?!? He working with Rondo to improve his shot??? Not Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, you know real legends not Rajon Rondo 😂 that’s like saying you need help with free throws and he working with Shaq or he needs work on his handles so he’s practicing with Charles Barkley!"
"If he was so good at it, where’s his ring? Stockton’s inability to be more aggressive and score more is why he has no rings. He’s not an all time great in my books. If anything he’s a poor mans Chris Paul or Rajon Rondo if he could shoot.  Please watch this video:  https://youtu.be/qSSlzcCCwts"
Workin on his shot with sharpshooter Rajon Rondo. Philly fans you sure your ready to part ways?
The fact he has chosen Rajon Rondo to mentor him on 3 Point Shooting does explain alot.
Just say Rajon Rondo lol I don’t like the implication that Simmons is coming to us. We got nothin to offer 😂
Would there be some way to trade Eric Gordon and John Wall to the Clippers for short and/or cheap contracts?   John Wall + Eric Gordon   For   Rajon Rondo + Patrick Beverly + Marcus Morris (or Luke Kennard)   Surprisingly works in the trade machine. Would the Rockets want to just dump Wall’s and Gordon’s salary? I don’t know enough about how Gordon played.
Old Socialite Rajon Rondo
"i agree, Cade is a bust. Pistons should cut bait and trade him. i think a veteran point guard like Rajon Rondo would really help their young guys develop"
"&gt;You said he'd be one of the best in the league 20 years ago, but then also said he wasn't anywhere near the caliber of player those two players are. So which is it?   My god, learn to read!  How many times do I have to tell you?  I did not say that Schroder ""wasn't anywhere near"" their caliber.  I said he was not their caliber.  Learn to read!  Learn to read!  Learn to read!  &gt;Similarly, you said he'd play a role that (according to you) was very common ""up until 20 years ago"" (when they all magically vanished)  They did not magically vanish, as the very presence of this thread illustrates.  And there are a few others around: TJ McConnell, Rajon Rondo, Pat Beverley, etc.  Again, if you don't have the slightest idea on the topic at hand, consider silence as an appealing alternative to continuing to demonstrate your complete ignorance.  &gt;, and at the same time wasn't as good as at least 3 of the players you mention below at it. How are we defining that he would have been ""one of the top point guards?""  Learn to count!   3 != 2.  &gt;So 6 players constitutes ""fairly common"" eh?  What do you suppose the words ""and others"" mean?  Holy god are you dumb.  &gt; And you even had to stretch to old journeymen at the tail end of their careers like Mookie and Mark Jackson to fit your narrative? And that's to say nothing of John Stockton, who was 39 at the time. If they're so common, why is there like three we've come across? Not exactly convincing evidence my guy.  What on earth have their ages got to do with anything?  Your red herrings are increasingly pathetic, and I'm about done wasting my time trying to teach you thing-one on this topic.  &gt;Again, you said they were fairly common up until 20 years ago. But then, as soon as we get to 20 years ago, they're suddenly hard to find.  They're not even all that hard to find today, as I just illustrated.    &gt; Should I go through the '99-'00 season as well? How many more ""old school"" point guards do you think I'll find?  I'm sure you'll find zero, but then I'm equally sure that you couldn't find your ass with both hands and a flashlight, so that's not saying much.  &gt;And will they all be as valued as you imply Dennis would be?   Again, learn to read.  I never implied any such thing.  &gt;Go on and take a well-educated super-literate big brain guess.  The mere fact that you think simple reading comprehension requires an enormous brain, far beyond what you possess, pretty much ends this thread."

It’s not crazy at all. People were trying to call Ben Simmons the next LeBron James or Magic Johnson. When the media is hyping him up like that saying he’s “only” Rajon Rondo makes sense.
"it's kind of crazy that a scout described him as being maybe a ""taller Rajon Rondo"" and meant it as an insult.  Rondo before he tore his ACL was becoming a perennial all-star, and that's without being 7 feet tall."
"""Taller Rajon Rondo"" hurt *my* feelings, and I'm not even simmons lol.  Worst thing is, at least rondo was a great teammate on the court, and got a ring very early in his career. It helped to validate his playstyle as ""pass-first"" instead of ""not willing to shoot"" (he was both tbh, but perception matters)."
This dude was awful most of the season. Did he really think teams were going to be knocking down the door after he somehow failed to be an improvement over a geriatric Rajon Rondo?
One time Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo won the chip for me in my first season. I didn't even get a chance to rebuild! I think this was 2k17 and my 3rd best player was Jahil Okafor or something lmao
You're thinking of Rajon Rondo.
"So, this lakers team cant be a super team then because Lebron is 36? I mean which is it. Again they came together and won a title, appearing in 1 other finals and an ECF. Not many other teams can say that over the last 10 + years. They also had a really good young rajon rondo.  The heat trio joined together to beat those guys. It was a lot closer on paper than you think. Yes - those were legitimately really good series. W/o brons crazy game 6&amp;7 against Boston, Celtics beat the heat and advance.

These are great basketball players who will figure it out.   I’m already seeing Bulls fans going “the fit with lavine and Demar makes very little sense to me”. Like what? Explain to me how? Have you played basketball with them? Do you think they’re the same player because they have a few common attributes? Do you think that a big athletic combo guard is something that NBA teams are wary of having too much of?  I personally think ppl just love to criticize when their front office doesn’t do exactly what their little 2K GM hearts thought of. Obviously there are moves to be criticized, but when the Bulls’ last big free season acquisitions have been Dwayne Wade, Rajon Rondo, and Thaddeus Young, i don’t get how you can be less than thrilled with our recent additions (including Vuc)  Call me crazy but I’ll put my trust in people like Arturas Karnisovas. For whatever reason, I think he knows a lot more about basketball than me or any fan here."
I’ve always enjoyed saying Rajon Rondo   Rayjon Rondo
i would say he never really got his shot back after utah... then he just got traded constantly. he entered the league like a rajon rondo with the potential to develop a shot
If I’m him I’m signing on the minimum to a contender and hope that I have a Reggie Jackson/Dwight Howard/Rajon Rondo sort of break out deep playoff run and then get some money the next off season.
"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."
"you won the title with:  * Kentavius Caldwell-Pope  * Good Rajon Rondo  * Danny Green  * Kyle Kuzma  * Alex Caruso  Instead of those guys, you now have a 33-year-old point guard who relies on his athleticism and can't shoot, defend, or play off ball."
"I love that they just crippled the franchise for a slightly more athletic Rajon Rondo with none of the defense, intelligence or leadership."
"Dennis ""Rajon Rondo"" Rodman"
"You're uh, provably wrong. He literally does not shoot enough to shoot any team out of a basketball game. He shoots a comparable amount of shots as Rajon Rondo.  There a ton of metrics which show Smart handling the ball and taking the amount of shots he does a game make the offense significantly better. He doesn't even have to hit the shots really. His assist rate to Jaylen and Jason is elite and the team's offensive rating with him at the point is better than without."
I mean yeah.  You're paying for the possibility that he'll be able to ball for a few 3-5 minute stretches to give a starter a break.  He gets a little more trust than most based on his past success in the playoffs.  The Rajon Rondo special.
"It's the best second round draft ever because of jokic alone. Before that Rajon Rondo was considered to be a huge late pick (and he is no hate plus ist even First round iirc) but Jokic is clearly the best talent ever picked in the second round. Other great ones are Marc Gasol and ofc Ginobili. Jokic being the MVP is massive and truly unique. The others are great players as well, especially Grant and Dinwiddie have a lot of potential. But jokic is what sets this draft apart from all the others."

"Right now, I'm wondering if a lot of the Pelicans issues could have been mitigated if Bledsoe had been the 1 instead and placing Lonzo more off-ball. Maybe Bledsoe wouldn't have checked out.       Lonzo is notoriously finicky to work in. Do you know how hard it is for a point guard to not fit with Jrue? Elfrid Payton. Rajon Rondo. Tim Frazier. Ish Smith. Seemingly every point guard that the Pelicans ran opposite Jrue gave acceptable production when the starter."
"At the start of the 2nd and 4th quarters, when you're up by 16, Avery Bradley is perfect player to come in and guard Rajon Rondo, or Lou Williams or even D.J. Augustin for 8-12 quality minutes."
"You ignore one thing, though: with one more roster spot left to fill, the Lakers are 13-players deep. This mean that they won't be forced to play anyone major minutes this season.   For instance, Westbrook is the starting PG obviously, but behind him is Kendrick Nunn, Rajon Rondo, and even THT (who plays SG too) who ran the point at times last season. For shooting guard, they have four or five guys that can play the spot. For center there is AD, D. Howard and DeAndre Jordan - all legit big men.  So yeah, health is always a concern and the average age of the Lakers isn't encouraging. However, by being so deep as a team (and they still have to get one more player which I hope is a SF/PF) a lot of this should be mitigated since no one has to play a ton of minutes."

"Ben wouldn’t be asking out of Philly if Brett Brown was still coaching. Doc publicly questioning Ben Simmons was the nail in the coffin. If your coach has that least amount of faith in you, how is that good for a locker room?   Doc is living off a championship he won with Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and Rajon Rondo. He’s not a great coach at all.   Simmons does clearly have issues offensively, but Doc also probably isn’t a good coach for him."

"Correct, if there are no pathways to become a coach because you are black, then it is not a meritocracy and there's a racial bias. You're operating on the assumption that this is currently the case. This seems to be the area where we disagree.   For instance of all the players currently playing, who are considered to be legitimate coaching candidates? Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Lebron James? If any of them wanted the opportunity, the pathway is there. If anything Udoka represents that pathway due to him being considered a no brainer future head coach since he first joined Pops coaching staff."
"Ricky Rubio, although not a bust, could have had a rajon rondo type media profile to him if he did the same thing on a winning team. Everyone would be like that guy just wins. Instead this passing artist was passing to like Martell Webster instead of at least one all star"

"Steph is definitely NOT a great passer. Calling a player like him a great passer, with his AST-TO ratio and his playoff history as a passer, is disrespectful to actually ""great passers"". Steph has had playoff SERIES with more turnovers than assists, calling him anything but a decent passer is massively overrating his passing capabilities.  Rajon Rondo is a great passer, LeBron James is a great passer, Magic Johnson was the greatest passer of all-time by far.  &gt; But to stay that the gap between shooting is smaller than the gap between passing is absurd.  No it isn't, Magic was actually a pretty good midrange shooter and in his last three years he shot either at league average from 3 or above it, if you ask me that's either better than Steph's ability as a passer or as good."

"Yes there is more to it than total assists and that is by watching him pass the ball. Russel Westbrook and Rajon Rondo have both averaged more assists in a single season than Steve Nash, yet Nash is a far superior passer than both. Nothing about watching Stockton pass says he is the greatest passer of all time."
theres levels to not being able to shoot man...russ cant shoot in like a normal oh this guy cant shoot...giannis is  worse than that...the guy cant even catch and shoot without putting the ball down with his left hand..hes jumper being god awful isnt as much of a problem bc hes wing shaq and just can bulldoze most matchups regardless..the guy shot like 85 percent from the line one game and people lost their minds in celebration...its like saying rajon rondo and elfried payton cant shoot..yes they both arent great shooters but theres levels to it
"MLB contracts can also hamstring teams, I agree (see Joe Mauer), but the difference is you can surround them with cheap players and still compete.  I also do agree, guaranteed contracts are terrible as they are structured now.  If a team spends the same amount of money (the salary cap/floor), the players on average will get the same amount of money, it will just go to those that still deserve it.  If contracts weren't guaranteed, I bet Blake Griffen, Paul Milsap, Rajon Rondo, LaMarcus Aldridge, etc would take some of that dead money, and rightfully so."

"If we're talking NBA (or professional basketball in general) then broadly speaking yes:  Guards who are considered bad shooters generally still do okay in the mid range and from the FT line and will take open 3s if they have them. Think Rajon Rondo or Ricky Rubio. Or Russell Westbrook. I don't know a guard in the NBA who absolutely can't shoot at all. There are however a handful of wings in the league who are very poor shooters, most famously Ben Simmons.   In general shooting is **always** a plus, no matter the position. This used to be different, when nobody cared if their center could hit 3s, because a center wasn't supposed to be at the 3 point line a lot. The importance of shooting decreases with increasing height however. Guards need to shoot at least half decent, Wings better do so or they should be elite at something else and bigs can easily be non shooters if they provide something different on offense(vertical spacing for example) and/or are very good defenders.  If you're learning to play the game of basketball, shooting is definitely the skill you should work the most on. Regardless of position. After that it's other fundamentals (layup package with either hand, handles, footwork, defensive stances and lateral movement, passing)"

Andriuskevicus was traded to the Bulls and suffered a significant head injury when a teammate punched him in practice. The Cavs received Eddie Basden in the trade.

Russell Westbrook now and pretty much ever is a better basketball player than Rajon Rondo. Get the fuck outta here.  Rondo was terrible for the vast majority of the 2020 season for the Lakers. Played better in the playoffs but still had some real stinkers. And was absolutely terrible last year in both Atlanta and on the Clippers. Westbrook is coming off a very good season.  We've never seen Westbrook as a third option. Many of his weaknesses are likely to not be as big of a deal when he doesn't need to do everything for his team.

"Yes, hall of fame Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrick, Dwight Howard, and Rajon Rondo. We’re in 2021, not 2013"
I see Rajon Rondo on ESPN at some point as a regular hot take guy. Bro is a brash asshole.  Same with Jimmy Butler.

Bulls Legend Rajon Rondo
"&gt; Rajon Rondo says Frank Vogel told him he ""missed my voice in the locker room"" last season.  This just proves that the real championship was always the friends you made along the way."
"Bonus drama points to him for being teammates with the following players before: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and even Shaq.  &amp;nbsp;  Having an opinion as an ex-teammate of LeBron James itself will get clicks. But along with that he's also a teammate of all the guys above and a lot of them either had beef with others there or have fanbases that have had rivalries/beefs with one of the other fanbases. Examples: LBJ fans vs KD fans, LBJ vs Kyrie, KD and his fans vs WB and his fans, Harden fans vs Westbrook fans, LeBron and his fans vs Celtics and their fans, LeBron and Ray Allen vs Celtics, LeBron vs Pierce, Ray Allen vs Rondo, etc.   &amp;nbsp;  There's plenty more headlines and drama I haven't even listed yet but Kendrick brands himself as someone who can provide unique, locker room insight, so it gets more juicy for drama lovers (especially when he's forced to pick a side)"
I find it really odd that Rajon Rondo's brother's name is William Rondo...
I love Rondo forever and if the Lakers play the Nets in the finals (so many juicy threads if that’s how it ends up) I’ll root for him to get another ring.   Wish we had him. Come home someday Rajon
"B - is good!  We did excellently to get Horford, Schroeder, Kanter, Richardson, Dunn who will be key role players.  Very disappointed about us losing a draft pick in this very talented draft class and even more disappointed that we have not gotten a pass first floor general.  Our last good floor general was Rajon Rondo, and for some reason we persist not getting a real floor general despite this being the MAIN reason why we fail deep in the playoffs.  I wanted to move for Ricky Rubio."
"Ok both comments lacked context, because we're biased fans, but the fact is that the Lakers were far more affected by injuries than the Suns. CP3 isn't equivalent to Bron *or* AD, let alone both. ""Oh well you're too top heavy"" well we just won a ring with Rajon Rondo as our third best player, so it's working out fine. And banking on the health of an injury prone 36yo superstar is quite literally how you guys made the finals last year, so weird to throw stones"
"The ole’ Ricky Rubio or Rajon Rondo problem of pure passers, though both those guys managed to develop quality shots and decent touch so tbh Simmons is an outlier."

Not to mention guys like Jokic, Trae Young, Luka Doncic who are just starting their careers but clearly already better playmakers… or controversial inclusions like Westbrook…"
"Stockton? No, he’s passive asf and doesn’t create as many scoring opportunities as Kobe.  Rajon Rondo literally runs in circles looking for an opportunity to make a cheap assist instead of creating real opportunities. There’s a reason why the term “rondo assist” exists.

"&gt; Nance isn’t a player that could move the needle for any team in any situation   I agree with your point but I hate this ""doesn't move the needle"" nonsense that get thrown around for any player that isn't a star. Any player can move the needle for a team that specifically needs a player like that, which I'd argue the Blazers do with their lack of good wing/PF depth for the past several years.   I mean does Rajon Rondo or KCP move the needle for a team in a vacuum? No, but in the Lakers role they were the 3rd and 4th best players on a championship squad. Does Cam Payne move the needle on every team? No but with the Suns he was one of the most important guys for them in their run. Nobody would've said any of those 3 guys move the needle before the years where they played in the playoffs and the finals.    In the right role Nance too can be a great role player who can contribute to winning basketball.   Tl;dr I think that phrase sucks. But I agree with your point."

Giannis is a power forward who often plays center. He is a big.  LeBron is straight up better than those guys. Forwards are inherently more valuable than guards because of their size and versatility. Great help defenders are also generally more valuable and harder to take out of the game than isolation specialists. LeBron is both. You might be able to entertain peak Artest vs. LeBron but his defensive prime was a flash in the pan compared to LeBron's.   Everything I said is reflected in postseason DRAPM which LeBron is #1 in since '98 among perimeter players. Here is what the rest of the list looks like.  Among qualifying players (2000+ MP):      1. LeBron James (2.28)      2. Kawhi Leonard ( 2.09)      3. Tony Allen (2.09)      4. Josh Howard (2.00)      5. Shawn Marion (1.84)      6. Paul George (1.72)      7. Jason Kidd (1.70)      8. Tayshaun Prince (1.67)      9. Rajon Rondo (1.64)      10. Bruce Bowen (1.53)      11. Danny Green (1.50)      12. Mike Conley (1.40)      13. Dwyane Wade (1.37)      14. Luol Deng (1.25)      15. Metta World Peace (1.23)  Kawhi is basically an upgraded version of Jordan defensively and LeBron is ahead of him while playing with minimal rim protection most of his prime.

When I protested to Lebron, he simply stated “I believe you aren’t educated on the situation and Chinese child labor laws.” I miss my boy dearly."
I saw it myself too and I disagree but that's ok and that's allowed. I don't know if ray Allen would have been a buck forevver. He played for four teams. George Karl had plenty of deep playoff runs. I wonder how rajon rondo and Kevin Garnett feel about ray Allen?  I guess he must have been a pretty decent coach to get the bucks to one win from the finals while benching all his good players.
That was 2009 Rajon Rondo levels of nasty
Tbh this list is trash. You have Rajon Rondo on here but not Walt Frazier?
PG Rajon Rondo SG Michael Jordan SF Giannis Antetokounmpo PF Dennis Rodman C Kevin Garnett 6th Stephen Curry
PG: Rajon Rondo (2012) / Derek Fisher (2001)  SG: Danny Green (2013) / Kyle Korver (2014)  SF: Shane Battier (2007) / OG Anunoby (2021)  PF: LeBron James (2017) / Draymond Green (2016)  C: Ben Wallace (2004) / Dikembe Mutombo (2000)
I think it might be possible but Rajon Rondo is not the guy I would want next to him. 3 3 and D guys with one somewhat competent playmaker/scorer (might be tough with under 10 career PPG)
Rajon Rondo  Derek Fisher   Trevor Ariza  LeBron James  Mutumbo
Rajon rondo found success without a great jumper.
"PG: Rajon Rondo  SG: Kyle Korver  SF: LeBron James  PF: Dennis Rodman/Draymond Green  C: Mark Eaton/Tyson Chandler/Joakim Noah/Dikembe Mutombo/Andrew Bogut  You can really abuse the 10 PPG thing with big men as you can see, lol.   Obviously you're kinda fucking yourself with picking big men that can't shoot and never were expected to guard the perimeter a ton, but just imagine the defensive potential. No one could score in the paint whatsoever, and everyone but Korver can be a lockdown defender."
"He was right, but that's not how you handle business as a vet. Rajon Rondo made that point when they were in Chicago together. You don't just roll out, talk loud, and then blame everybody else when you lose. What does that accomplish?  Did LeBron ever do that? Kobe? KG? He's not the only good player to be on a bad team."
"Fighting in the NBA is reserved for Rajon Rondo and Chris ""Untucked Jersey"" Paul and no one else"
"Lakers shouldn't be losing with this line up. Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo. That used to be a team you bring to the Olympics."
"What kind of sheltered bs is this. He clearly meant white people are a majority in the US. Globally white people are a minority lmfao. To pretend race has nothing to do with players’ popularity is absurd. Caruso has more followers than Rajon Rondo (lmao are you unaware of Rondo’s career before the lakers?????), Jimmer Fredette was a phenomenon, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. Not acknowledging stuff like that is a real problem"
"You don't have to give into it. It's not even a basketball thing! It's just American life.. and there's logic to it of course (that's why it doesn't bother me). Literally everything white is more popular because white people are the majority so everything they do is more palatable to a majority of people. Goes for music, movies, fashion, sports, everything really.   I didn't even know this before and just checked now. Caruso has more followers on instagram than Rajon Rondo! lol come on.. it's not like he's the most interesting dude to ever exist. His personality is completely normal."
"Rajon Rondo flair is what you need to be burned at a stake for. If you hate the Mavs its a good troll, but if you like them you would never have that abomination tied to your name"
"My petty statement is that Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, and Patrick Beverley are all assholes, and each one of them deserves to be jumped by the other two."
Rajon Rondo is a cunt and I hope he and the Lakers never win another game for the rest of their respective existences.   I also feel the same way about Dwayne Wade and the Heat.
"Bro change your flair, you cant say blasphemy like this while having a fucking Mavs Rajon Rondo flair without it being obvious you hate the Mavs"
"I dislike the duo, I'd prefer to have (former) point guards, like it would never happen but for example a duo of Nash and CP3 or Chauncey Billups and Rajon Rondo"

"I am down for the idea that NBA needs to institute fights like NHL has. Can you imagine the ratings? The crowd would go nuts. The viewers would go nuts. Bring in JR &amp; the KING to announce some games. Use some kick ass WWE type music. I can already hear JR yelling ""BY GAWD BY GAWD HERE'S RAJON RONDO! MY GAWWD RONDO NO NO HE'S GOT A FAMILY!""."
Rajon Rondo is the most clear dividing line for being or not being a hall of famer (to me)  if you have a better career than Rajon Rondo you get hall of fame if its worse you don't   anyway I think Rondo won't make the hall of fame and will be one of the best to not be in it
"I think one of the difficulties you encounter is that Bron has had such a long career, that even if these came up at a below average rate, you are still left with a high amount of incidents.  You also need to take into account 'dirty' plays that he is on the receiving end of.  In total, I think there is only a handful of genuinely dirty players (ones that come MY mind: Zaza, Pat Bev, Ron Artest, Bruce Bowen). And the ones that get accused: Russell Westbrook, Enes Kanter, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo... I think they get involved in a couple of hairy instances and people make the jump. People were calling Dellavedova dirty back in 2015."
And both sucumb to normal human frustration. But are also bigger and stronger than most people so their moments of frustration can do a whole lot more than a moment of frustration from Rajon Rondo.

"Rajon Rondo holds the highest single game rebounds record at the University of Kentucky. 19 rebounds against Iowa on Nov. 21, 2005. AD was 1 short in a game against Chattanooga."
Now imagine that roster when LeBron is injured. Who’s creating shots for everyone? The corpse of Rajon Rondo?
"Go back to Cleveland, trade all the young talent and picks for vets that get it like Jaymichael Green, Iguodala, Andre Drummond, jj reddick, Rajon Rondo, and the prize free agent/trade piece Derozan.          Edit: Fire the head ball coach and get Byron Scott as HC."
Avery Bradley and Rajon Rondo scored 0 pts in 42 minutes of combined played.
"the sad secret may be that Russ never really knew how to play championship basketball. he could definitely go back to a mediocre team and put up incredible stats. but the lakers dont need that. we need him to be Rajon Rondo, who he has never been."
Figured Rondo had done this in the last 15 years. Seems like a prime Celtics Rajon stat line.

"Because an average player didn't get the ball in his hands as much as Russ. That's the most dumb thing a coach could do, rely on Russ for mass production, where he is truly below average. Westbrook had all time high volumes in term of possessions played, USG%, shots, and so on, for this reasons he could average triple double and 20 ppg seasons. Still he is really one of the worst players in the Ast/TO ratio, that means he shouldn't been allowed to play some many possessions because he is trash in managing them. Same with shots, he is below league average in shooting from every position on the court. He is bad at the rim, bad from midrange and total trash from 3. Still Russ is one of the players that take more FG in the league.  Russ plays this trash nowadays because coaches let him plays like he is a star, while truly be below average in doing everything.  Give Rajon Rondo the same freedom and he will make more assist on less turnovers than Westbrook for sure."

You think the team that let Rajon Rondo point a finger gun at a fan without penalty is censoring Carmelo Anthony?
"Even so, what does that guy do for you when possessions matter?   When possessions matter, the basketball needs to be in LeBron's hands.   Russ' only value can come as a screener or a backside cutter. He cannot shoot. If he's screening and cutting, what is AD doing?   If you've got both of them out there and the ball is in LeBron's hands, why do they have traditional 5s on this roster?  You simply cannot play those two guys alongside Dwight or DeAndre. THT can't really shoot, either.  And what do you do with Rondo? Can't really play him out there with Russ, either, as he's a guy who's best with the ball in his hands and is Russ going to defer to Rajon Rondo? Doubtful.

"James Harden is a combo guard. Rajon Rondo was a pure PG. You don't have to have deficient scoring to be a pure PG (Nash, Stockton and CP3 are fantastic offensive players) but it's about mentality and offensive role."
"Nah, all players are identical to one of prime Michael Jordan, prime Rajon Rondo, or Kevin Knox. Any time a team wins a game they weren’t the favorite in, we just move a player between levels. Simple as"
"Rajon Rondo once played half a playoff series with a dislocated elbow (thanks Wade, you dirty motherfucker).  He was shockingly effective playing with just one hand/arm, but ultimately not good enough"
"I never said he was a saint. I never said he was perfect. His talking to the refs has to stop. That’s not a big deal, IMO, and something that’s easily fixable. It doesn’t really relate to the situation.   And no, he won’t win a power struggle. If it’s him or Luka, Luka is going to win. But there were obviously feelings stemming from who Rick was that caused him to react to Carlisle that way. Again, Carlisle is known to be a dick. Luka is not the first to butt heads with him and likely won’t be the last. It’s one thing if he clashes with Rajon Rondo. But the Mavs are banking on Luka being the future. So yeah, he had to go.   My main issue is people saying, without evidence, that he’s a hard to work with diva just because of this Carlisle stuff. There’s nothing pointing to that. He’s well-liked and his teammates always talk highly of him."
"Rudy Gay, Rajon Rondo, Boogie Cousins, Seth Curry was the year"
"We brought in former All Stars: Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Rajon Rondo. We swung and missed on Solomon Hill and Etwaun Moore. It's an absolute fallacy that the Pelicans didn't do everything possible to win. We took a game in the postseason from the Hampton Warriors after losing Boogie to a freak injury. We had a top 5 team in the league (Cavs, Warriors, Rockets were the only ones better at the end of '18 for sure.)  Then all of a sudden ADisney has no help and wants out. Our front office's incompetence is greatly exaggerated. ADisney is just soft and is best as an auxiliary piece rather than the main piece.   The only poor thing you can say that this front office has done so far since ridding ourselves of a lying cancer is how we handled JJ. Jrue wanted out and we got a treasure trove of picks. We're set up to be a huge buyer at the deadline / next offseason when the timeline for Zion/BI starts right. We may let Lonzo walk but I'll see it when I believe it.   Bad take."
"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don’t get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton’s staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn’t quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse’s staff, Tyronn Lue’s staff, and Frank Vogel’s staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There’s a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."
"I wonder if Markelle Fultz, Rajon Rondo, and Lonzo Ball could be involved. Just shuffle around a bunch of PGs who shoot like garbage."
"Rondo came into the league with an awful shooting stroke and was routinely left by himself on the perimeter by opposing teams.  Despite being shorter and less built than Simmons, Rajon has made it work.  It has to be strictly a mental block Ben is facing and he fears his shooting woes may not be ignored if the rest of his play isn't stellar; as a result he avoids shooting."
"Maybe a bit biased, but I don't like Dwayne Wade ever since he used the Bulls for a final payday and caused a massive riff in the locker room. At the end of January, Dwade convinced Jimmy to collectively throw the young players under the bus in a post game press conference.  Rajon Rondo, being an understanding vet went off on Dwade on Instagram, all three faced fines and the young players jumped on twitter to defend themselves. The Bulls went on a massive downward losing swing after this. Then around March, after Dwade got hurt, the Bulls led by Rajon Rondo, Jimmy B, and the young players went on a run to secure the 8th seed. Bulls take 2-0 lead against the Celtics on the road behind Rondo, Paul Zipser, Jimmy Butler, and Bobby Portis. Rondo breaks his thumb and misses the rest of the series, Dwade plays like absolute trash. We eventually Lose 4-2 to Celtics. Jimmy is traded, Rajon was waived, and Dwade was bought out. The bulls haven't won more than 27 games since until this season where we won 31."
It was actually because of a shit GM. Vlade wanted to make cap space and he's an idiot so he used FRPs to do it. Who did they end up with in FA? Rajon Rondo...

"&gt; Prologue,  &gt; The Off season:  Magic left the Lakers. The team was said to be dysfunctional with dramas, Jeannie Buss does not know what she is doing, Rob Pelinka does not know what he is doing.   Terrible team front office, people on the street to complain about the team at one point.  &gt; LeBron James:   Revenge season after not getting to the finals for the first time after 8 consecutive finals. The king has fallen from his throne #WashedKing.   Some people thought this was it for the LeBron. He is too old, the league has finally moved on.  &gt; Other players  Rajon Rondo: A player that now don the purple and gold jersey, he was once the starter for the Celtics that took down Lakers in 6 many years before. He is now washed and fans would rather for coach to not play him. It was only until the Playoff where he showed “Playoff Rondo”.  KCP: “Binary Mamba” for his early performances and the person in prison. People doubted him and later he become the 3rd leading scorer for the Lakers throughout the Playoffs.  And more others.  &gt; Kawhi offseason saga  After obtaining AD, the Lakers had a shot to get Kawhi Leonard after a smart cap management by supposedly someone who does not understand how cap space work, Rob Pelinka  Due to waiting for Kawhi, the Lakers missed many Free Agents that were getting signed in places.   In the end, Kawhi decided to join forces with PG and the Doc Rivers’ Clippers. Brilliant move from him that hurt the Lakers because they waited for him.  &gt; Getting the pieces  However, in that slightly dark times, some a free agent that had just won the finals was waiting for where Kawhi would sign.  That person would then drop 28 points as the leading scorer for the Lakers in the opening night.   In Kobe’s word, someone who does not choose to be a Lakers “ain’t the one”. However, unlike Kawhi, he was the one.  His name was Danny Green.  The Lakers would then add more pieces around and getting someone such as Bradley Beal and finally giving a two year 5 million contract for the later Finals Starter, Alex Caruso.  In the birthday of Kobe Bryant himself, they decided to sign a person who has had bad reputation after his first stint with the Lakers.   He had become a locker room cancer and someone that was hard to coach, a former Monster back in his Orlando days, that had become “washed”. Nobody wanted him.  It was either him or Joakim Noah.  That person was Dwight Howard, he had finally made his return years later. Being signed in the birthday of Kobe Bryant can only be written in the star.   Meanwhile, Joakim Noah would later sign with the Clippers.  &gt; First half,  The Lakers had finally started their Revenge Season  &gt; The beginning of the season  Despite a strong start, the Lakers were told that they had an easy schedule, and it was reflected through their records as they have the lowest record against other .500 team as a team above .500 beside the Denver Nuggets. They would lose the first two games against the Clippers and lose some more to “good” teams.  Despite this, the Lakers stayed consistent and kept winning when they had the lead coming to the 4th. They do not drop any games that are winnable such as those against weaker below .500 team.   This is also because of the energy that they started the season with, the team truly gel together, they had the best fun that they have ever experienced. Dwight was turning to become a game changer, Javale was the one shouting the Lake Show. They even had dinner and goes to movie together. Even took a memorable picture in the Air Plane as they continue their story.  &gt; Kobe Bean Bryant  He had finally watched Basketball once more after years away from it due to his daughter named Gianna wish to see it with him.   Anytime he is in the building, LeBron and the Lakers would put out a show. Never losing when he is in attendance. Many times him and LeBron were seen interact with each other, not as rivals but as friends.   Past 2019, LeBron was playing against 76ers in Philadelphia about to pass him in all time points scored.   LeBron had finally passed Kobe in his hometown. Kobe Bryant than posted in his social media, “to continue to move the game forward and give ways to the new generation”. In his instagram was the picture of him and LeBron shaking hands just a few weeks before.  Just 12 hours later, was the darkest time in Lakers, in NBA history. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, with other passenger and the pilot had passed away due to a helicopter crash.  It was a dark time.  &gt; Not trading anyone  Despite the flaws that was seen in the Lakers team, even after the trade deadline, they decided to believe in team chemistry and continue with the people they have. “FOR KOBE” is what they move forward for.   &gt; After the All Star and COVID and BLM  The Lakers finally had found their groove. Finally, they were able to beat favorite Clippers and Bucks in consecutive games.   After a strong form however, the world was not the same. After the outbreak of a new virus, and the incident of Rudy Gobert and the Jazz, the NBA stopped, the world would soon follow. Everyone went to lockdown and the world was never the same.  In covid times, the world was going mentally crazy as everyone is challenged to a new lifestyle. The mental stress that had accumulated then exploded in twitter disputes, people getting cancelled left and right, celebrities getting exposed in these tough times. Then, the BLM movement happened, LeBron was one of the most vocal voice throughout.  &gt; Second half,  &gt; Getting the final pieces and the NBA bubble  The teams were collected to live in a “bubble” as the NBA wishes to continue the season.  However, for the Lakers, Bradley Beal, one of the best defender in the team, decided to not go. The bubble is not for everyone. Luckily for the Lakers they had signed Markief Morris earlier who would later be one of the most important role player for the Lakers.  Despite winning once more against the Clippers with a great showing from LeBron, the Lakers finished the season weak and were barely able to beat Nuggets’ bench players.  But time is always moving, and the Lakers as the first seed had zero advantages of being one. The playoffs would start soon.  &gt; Finale,  &gt; The playoffs  Despite later being called a “mickey mouse ring” or with an asterisk, it was one of the best played playoffs of all time. Players were shooting lights out, multiple game 7s, historic double 3-1 comeback, the 5th seed to Finals, and so on.  For the Lakers: from KCP, Alex Caruso, Dwight, Playoff Rondo, AD and his buzzer beater, LeBron and everyone else. To reach the Finals against an old team of LeBron lead by Jimmy Butler who people doubted.  And many more storylines in the playoffs.  Such as Caruso performance, starting in Finals from a meme G-League.  KCP being solid for the Lakers.  Playoff Rondo winning another one, but this time with the purple and gold.  Dwight getting his ring finally.  “Job’s not done”  And so on.   Note: I am sure I missed many stories, but it just goes to show what a storyline the 2020 Lakers were, and how they ended perfectly at the right time."
"When he gained speed and accelerated it looked like 2k with increased gamespeed settings. He outsprinted the quickest guards in the league like it was nothing, on or off-ball it didn't matter. I remember one fastbreak against the Celtics in particular where he got the ball after a rebound and just steamrolled past a young Rondo by the time he was nearing the 3-point line and Rajon was considered one of the quickest guards in the league at that time... And had a couple of meters advantage when the play started. LBJs handles were so good already it didn't matter if he had to dribble the ball in transition, he lost close to no speed whatsoever"
"Rajon Rondo. He has the IQ, knows the bball plays, and has the chips. He's clearly bored on the Clips and would do well."
"I see your point. However, it’s not just 3s that he doesn’t take. Hell he just notoriously passed up a *wide open* layup under the basket to a covered teammate that led to a turnover. He almost always passes out of a high post situation, despite having a size matchup against most guards. We’ve seen he’s capable of a good inside low post game, but he never utilizes it. It’s like he wants to be Rajon Rondo in a big body but he’s indecisive as hell"
"I like:  - Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounpo because they sound like Greek Gods   - Also Lonzo Ball because that's just a perfect name for an NBA player (LaMelo is such a stupid first name that it cancels out the Ball last name)   - Steph and Seth Curry also got some nice names  - Danilo Galinari and Rajon Rondo are also great, as you mentioned  - I also like Rudy Gobert when spoken in a heavy French accent  - J.R. Smith is dope too even if it's kinda basic"
"The Suns had the No. 21 pick in the 2006 NBA draft and selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo. They promptly traded Rondo to Boston for cash and a 2007 first-round pick. Then, they traded that 2007 pick to Portland for cash. So, essentially, the Suns sold Rondo to get some money. Definitely ended up working in Rondo’s favor tho."
"The year before Butler was drafted, Rajon Rondo was the best player on a finals team (2010 Celtics). Chauncey Billups was the best player on a championship team for the Pistons. These things are rare, but it does happen. Nobody would argue that Billups or Rondo were ever even as good as Butler, but Butler is closer to their tier than in the all time great Steph, Lebron, KD, Duncan tier."
"Rajon Rondo, game 3 vs. the Warriors in the 2018 playoffs:  * 4 pts, 10 reb, 21 ast, +22 BPM, W  Dude picked apart the KD Warriors in a playoff game while scoring just two baskets."

&gt;With the elimination of Kawhi Leonard and Rajon Rondo on the LA Clippers  and Ibaka
Rajon Rondo getting going back to back
"Can you blame me when you lobbed that one up for me? 😂  Alright, here's a real answer for you: in that Game 7 Kobe was still the game's leading scorer, scoring more than a quarter of the Lakers' points in the game. He had 23 of the Lakers' 83 points, which was huge for them. That was an insanely intense defensive game for both teams where almost everyone had poor shooting performances:  Paul Pierce: 5-15, 18 pts  Ray Allen: 3-14, 13 pts  Rajon Rondo: 6-13, 14 pts  Pau Gasol: 6-16, 19 pts  Andrew Bynum: 1-5, 2 pts  Lamar Odom: 3-8, 7 pts  About the only guys who didn't shoot poorly were Kevin Garnett (8-13, 17 pts) and Ron Artest (7-18, 20 pts). It should also be pointed out that Kobe also had 15 rebounds in the game (only Pau had more, with 18, nobody else from either team had more than 10). Kobe stepped up and did was his team needed him to do, and that's a big reason why they won the game, the series and the championship.   Can you make a similar case for Paul George tonight? He wasn't god awful, but he really wasn't very impactful overall. Honestly for me it's less about the 6 makes than it is the only 15 shots. He needed to be far more aggressive than he was. Kobe wasn't hitting his shots in that Game 7 in 2010, but he damned sure wasn't going to let his team lose. He was going down swinging if he was going down. Paul George didn't have that same kind of fight tonight, and I'm guessing if you're being honest you'd agree with me.   As for the minutes played and all of that, by the time Kobe finished that Game 7 he had played 923 playoff minutes over 23 games. On top of that it was his third straight year making it to the Finals, having played 863 minutes across 21 playoff games in 2008 and 940 minutes across 23 playoff games in 2009. That was also after missing only 9 total games in those three years, along with having participated in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. So if Paul George is tired then he's got 89 days to rest up before training camps open and then he has to go back to it."
"they still have Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins and Marcus Morris"
"Don't forget the benched Rajon Rondo, who won a title last year &amp; played great in the Finals lol"
"Despite the Clips having a +6 NetRTG for the playoffs before game 5 of this series (when Rondo officially stopped playing entirely), Rajon Rondo managed to have a -6 NetRTG for the playoffs. Every moment he was on the floor was terrible, especially in this series."
The Rajon Rondo curse is now broken!!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOO
Damn the trainer walking with Rajon Rondo is a whole baddie
"Rajon Rondo felt dangerous tonight 🥶 DNP, 0 points, 0 assists, 0 rebounds"
Rajon Rondo. A PG that couldn’t shoot and started to become a liability on defense. I’m shocked he’s still highly regarded as he is…  “Playoff rondo”
Sacramento kings legends Boogie Cousins and Rajon Rondo are hungry
"From what I've heard, it's just a matter of who fits where, and apparently Rajon is a better fit for this current Clippers team. Besides, it's not like Lou was performing particularly well over there recently.  It's another one of those win / win trades I guess? Well, it's certainly been a win for ATL at least — *has* Rondo been better than Lou for the Clippers this postseason?"
"I still dont get it, that they traded him for Rajon Rondo."
"One played Division 1 basketball in the Missouri Valley. If you want NBA comps Rajon Rondo, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Rose all markedly diminished after ACL tears. ~25% of athletes tear their ACL again and 55% never return to their same level of play.  Also don’t shit on athletes when you’re spending your time on a fan page for athletes, blog boy."
Rajon Rondo isn't getting any minutes for them either and they gave us two 2nd round picks and took on his $7.5m salary for next season
"Plenty of people have walked off the court, and several have actually kept playing after tearing their ACL.  Namely Zach Lavine and Rajon Rondo.  Him walking off unfortunately doesn't rule at a tear in the slightest."
Well the second player you described is Rajon Rondo so yeah he would probably be fringe hofer.

Yea Rajon rondo in 08
Rajon Rondo with the celtics maybe?
"I don’t know percentages, but Rajon Rondo isn’t really a shooter and the Celtics got their chip. Not sure if it counts considering they had    Paul “the truth” Pierce, Ray “Jesus Shuttleswoth” Allen, and Kevin “Big Ticket” Garnett.  So there really wasn’t a need for him to shoot...he just had to facilitate."
"&gt;he improved lebrons, alex caruso and rajon rondo   He improved LeBron and Rondo? Lmao"
"we won a chip in the first year and he improved lebrons, alex caruso and rajon rondo   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  yall just love to circlejerk each other in this sub and its so funny"
"""More aggressive"" is an understatement.  Young Rajon Rondo played on a team with three guaranteed hall-of-famers and a bunch of hungry veterans and asserted himself as the floor general and a locker room voice. Kid made everyone stop considering the Celtics as a big three and instead as a big four, and put up constant great performances in big games despite drawing media attention and defensive attention from big stars who took on the Rondo assignment themselves. And Rondo did that at a skinny 6'1"" with a poor jump shot and a poor free throw percentage; fought through it and made things happen.  Ben didn't assert himself this year with role players off the bench.  I think Ben's still overrated because, even after that nightmare series, people are still concerned with ""the idea of Ben Simmons"" and convincing themselves that he can totally transform himself and his mentality. In all honesty, changing your mentality to that extent is harder than it would be to just develop a jumpshot or refine a few go-to moves. And Ben needs to do all three of those things."

“Whatcha want me to do? Suck him off?” - Rajon Rondo when a reporter asked him how great AD is.
As a casual nba fan can someone explain how Rajon rondo is on every team all the time
RAJON RONDO CP3 HEAVYWEIGHT BATTLE WHO YALL GOT
Rajon Rondo?
"Rajon Rondo, Lou Williams, Dennis Schroeder, Mike Conley, Patrick Beverly, Darious Garland, Devonte Graham……. Plenty of guys. The hawks have had 3 guys of these guys on our team alone"
Rajon Rondo? Beat the lakers with boston and then was a key player for the lakers ring. I dont know if he was really hated by the lakers before though.
"I totally understand why one would think Cousins is the right guy for that spot, he's huge. But I really feel like Rondo could have solved this. Remember this play? https://www.sbnation.com/2016/1/22/10814986/rajon-rondo-hawks-kings-defense-basketball-iq"
"RAJON ""STEPH CURRY"" RONDO. what timeline is this!?"
Rajon Rondo the veteran 3 point specialist is quite the unexpected career arc
Pelicans legend Rajon Rondo
Rajon “3 Pt. Specialist” Rondo
"Rajon ""Curry"" Rondo"
Former pelican Rajon Rondo
"I'm not saying that he's a great coach or Doc shouldn't have given Mann a chance, but I do think it's unfair to say he never plays rookies.   Jared Sullinger, Rajon Rondo, Tyrone Wallace, Shamet, SGA, Big Baby, Corey Maggette, and Chucky Atkins are just a few examples (also I realize you're not necessarily making this argument either, but others in the thread are)."
Rajon Rondo is better than Ben Simmons
"Pressure makes diamonds. I love this article, feels like you get a little insight into his mind: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1544219-rajon-rondo-doesnt-mess-around-when-it-comes-to-connect-four"
See also Rajon Rondo. Great at passing and running o but just totally impotent when it comes to scoring (or finishing a fight for that matter).   A poor man’s version of Pat Bev the last thing the Clippers needed. I’m sorry what were we talking about?
And the dude tried to fucking fight Rajon Rondo for saying the f-word during a team meeting.  Dude couldn't stand his own starting point guard.  It's amazing they lost in 7 during that second run.
"Damn, beat me to it. I just posted the same joke with Rajon Rondo instead."
To say Ben doesn’t care is such a dumb take. If he didn’t care he would have been like Vince Carter the end of raptors era or Rajon Rondo when he was on the mavs
"It's a really weird comparison. Theoretically, Ben is faster, bigger, jumps higher, and has better handles. That means he should be able to score more and pressure the defense more. But time and time again, in the playoffs, Draymond elevates his game to basically average a 15 point triple double whereas Ben Simmons becomes Rondae Hollis-Jefferson with HOF Flashy Passer. I think using Ben as a Draymond role is not a good fit because he has so many physical gifts Draymond will never have, and Draymond has leadership, better defensive IQ, and playoff intensity that Ben will never have. He needs to be used like Lebron without shooting, but that will only ever happen if he stops passing out of layups like he's Rajon Rondo."
"Good example.  It wasn't too long ago that rajon rondo was able to dominate a playoff series against the Cavs without shooting from the outside. He was the best player in a series that featured LeBron, kg, pierce and ray allen.   He was in full on attack mode the entire series (https://youtu.be/tQRl_jZHgKw). Draws in the defense, attacks the hoop and when he forces the rotation he has a cutter. They played him the same way they played Ben (sagging off on the perimeter). Granted rajon is quicker and probably a better ball handler but Ben has the size and strength."

"Those teams also have great role players. Up-and-coming Rajon Rondo, young defensive stalwarts in Tony Allen and Perk, 3-point specialists in Eddie House and James Posey, the championship veteran presence in Sam Cassell, and the undisputed GOAT in Brian Scalabrine!"
"Yeah a team with KG, Pierce, Ray Allen, and a then budding Rajon Rondo. Any coach could have coached them to 1 ring. If anything, he underachieved by only getting 1. He also underachieved with stacked Clippers teams and never won there."
Oh are we describing teams by their least effective player? wHy CoUldNt LuKa bEaT rAjOn RoNdO
"Explanation: Shaq played in the NBA from 1992-2011. From 1984-2020, at least one player that played in the NBA Finals was a future, current, or former teammate of Shaq's in the NBA. If Rajon Rondo makes it to the finals in 2021, that streak will be extended to 38 years. No other former teammate of Shaq besides Rondo still has any chance of making the 2021 NBA Finals as a player."
Ben Simmons is a 6’11” version of Rajon Rondo.
"Doc rivers is a great coach if you have good veterans, because he can navigate players personalities. That Celtic team with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, and Kendrick Perkins are player who know their roles and can execute was special. His X and O during the playoffs is just average so far."
"Taller, Light skin Rajon Rondo"
"Doc was seen as a pretty 'meh' coach in Orlando and Boston who could never get out of the first round.  Then he got gifted the original Big 3 (plus young Rajon Rondo), got a 'ship and another finals appearance in four years with them.  Then he went to the Clippers at the time of their ascendancy, and yet, again, could never perform in the playoffs, never going past the second round.  Now with Philly, same thing.   He's always been a pretty average coach who won't get a team over the hump, and one title with a stacked Celtics team in 2007 doesn't change that."
imagine giving a shittier and taller Rajon Rondo a max contract lmfao
Ben Simmons is just a bigger Rajon Rondo
Ben Simmons so much like Rajon Rondo. I remember Turtle would go like 15 straight games without attempting a free throw
"Ben ""Rajon Rondo"" Simmons"
“ 16 game playoff assassin” Rajon Rondo sure did his part to swing this game and make sure the Clippers stay on schedule today
Rajon Rondo is very good - but he can't carry the Clippers on his own. If only he had his #2 by his side. Poor Kawhi!
Freshly minted r/nba genius Ty Lue continues to play Rajon Rondo like its 2009 and makes sure his team starts every series down 0-2.
Rajon Rondo would like a word
He beefed with Rajon Rondo and now Luka Doncic. It seems like Porzingis isn't fond of him either based on his post game comments this season.   At the end of the day it doesn't matter how good your coach is at adjustments and gameplans if he is disliked by his players
"Jason Kidd and rajon rondo famously, not sure if other tiffs have come up, obvs Luka now as well"
"Either the Sixers or Clippers have to make the finals this year to keep the former Shaq teammate making the finals streak alive. It’s between Rajon Rondo and Danny Green now that the Lakers, Heat and Nets are all gone"
"Friendly reminder that the “former teammate of Shaq making the finals” streak is still very much possible but would require either the Clippers or Sixers to make the finals this year. The Nets, Bucks and Heat all could have carried on the tradition but now that they are all gone it’s down to Rajon Rondo and Danny Green as the only players left who can keep the streak alive. If neither team makes it the streak will end for the first time in over 37 years"
No you also need talent  Make Rajon Rondo do all the things and he's still an ass shooter
If Marc Jakckon played with Malone he also would make 10+ assists. Or Rajon Rondo.
nah its not lol he would be just another rajon rondo if it wasnt for karl malone
"Mitch Richmond, Demarcus Cousins, Marc Gasol, Glen Rice, Rajon Rondo, Eddie Jones  Former all stars who can’t even sniff the honorable mentions."
Rajon Rondo  The NBA would be better without him.
"If AD plays the 5, which he likely will now, their shooting will be fine. Are gonna pretend that the lakers werent play dwight and mcgee at center, with an ice cold DG and rajon rondo, when they won the chip"
"Exactly; Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo were important parts of the playoffs in 2020, and they were relatively cheap.    The folks on the 2021 playoff team didn't pan out (Schroder most of all), but we'll have a different mix this time."
Who were their outside shooting threats when they won a championship? Is the 3 point prowess of Rajon Rondo and KCP really so hard to replace? They can easily find guys who will knock down open jumpers with 10 feet of space between them and the closest defender.
"Something something, won a championship starting Rajon rondo"

"Depth isn't an issue. These super teams sacrifice depth for high end talent. If everyone stays healthy, it usually works. If people get hurt, that's the season. That's the risk. Teams as stacked as LAL and Brooklyn don't give a shit about depth. They're both going to get ring chasers and buy out players anyway. Depth is for teams with one star, not 3. Remember when the Heat had no depth? And the Cavs, Lakers, Warriors and Celtics.   No spacing. Lmao. They'll find guys for Russ and LeBron hit for open 3s. Having elite 3 point shooters isn't the only way to win. Lakers literally just won with Rajon ""Reddit says I can't space the floor"" Rondo hitting daggers. Guys will step up.   Fit? You think a championship coach, LeBron and AD aren't going to be able to make it work with someone as good as Westbrook? Hey call off the trade. Redditors who know fuck all about basketball say it's a bad fit!"
Fun fact: Rajon Rondo turned into a sniper in the 2020 playoffs shooting 40% from 3.

He signed LeBron who goes wherever he wants, and traded what was probably too much for an All-NBA player who said he only would go to the Lakers and refused to play otherwise.  What’s he thinking with this move? IDK, circus music?"

Rajon Rondo To Chris Paul In 2021: “I’ve Got 2 Rings And You’re Never Gonna Win One”
"Those are pro players he's playing against which is even crazier. Aaron Holiday, Svi Mykhailiuk, Kenrich Williams, Mike James, Lonnie Walker, Rajon Rondo, and Quincy Pondexter."
Marc Gasol increased his three point percentage.  Ben McLemore increased his three point percentage.  Lance Stephenson increased his three point percentage.  Rajon Rondo increased his three point percentage.
"We should have kept Rajon Rondo, he is a better playmaker, and infinitely more reliable."
Chris Paul for Rajon Rondo
"People keep claiming it’s a team sport , but don’t mention the past 20 championships having the top few to top handful of players in the league on those teams. Only exception I can think of are the Detroit Pistons? Before that it was constantly Magic / Bird .. then Jordan / Hakeem … Shaq / Kobe / Duncan / Dirk  … Lebron / Curry / Kawhi / Giannis . And Detroit Pistons that one year. Unless I’m missing somebody ?   Edit: Boston Celtics (Ray Allen / Paul Pierce / Kevin Garnett / Rajon Rondo) absolute unit of a team. Hey"
wait are you seriously comparing Rajon Rondo to Giannis right now? I was being facetious.
I mean Rajon Rondo has longevity and a larger body of work in the playoffs by that metric.
I understand what you are saying but if 2 superstars carry a team to the title without a legit third all star then those 2 superstars deserve the full credit.   For example the 3rd best player on Lakers team was actually Rajon Rondo in 2020 playoffs. I gotta give it to LeBron/AD for winning that title.   Although they really did luck out with their opponents. If they had beaten the Clippers in WCF and Bucks in finals \[which I think they would have but who knows\] it would have been a more impressive title.
Rajon Rondo reminds of my Puerto Rican friend Josh
Rajon Rondo = 2 rings plus left hook   Point God = 0
"“Chris, how happy are you for Rajon Rondo right now?”"
Rajon Rondo - 2 plus a magnificent left hook  Chris Paul - 0

"I like to manually slide the progress bar whenever someone posts a highlight on Reddit. Slowly go back and forth a few seconds at a time and watching each player each time I scroll through to get a feel for where they are, why they are there, what they are trying to do, and why it worked/failed.  Besides that, the more highlights or game breakdowns you watch on YouTube the better you’ll get and eventually you’ll see some stuff real time. There aren’t too many know every play live, just the basics, so don’t feel bad. If you did see every play coming each time you’d either be a pro coach or Rajon Rondo."
"you have patrick beverley, paul george, rajon rondo, serge ibaka, and demarcus cousins on your team"
If you actually watch the show Shannon is the straight man most of the time. His only outrageous takes come with LeBron. A lot of his arguments are very grounded and sensical. I would rather see Shannon posted than some shit about Connect 4 (yes there were posts about how Rajon Rondo being good at good connect 4 made him good in the playoffs at one point)

Rajon Rondo licking his lips
Rajon Rondo. Great pf and Center
Rajon Rondo would've ripped into Giannis for his poor shot selections. Who on the Bucks has the balls to tell Giannis he needs to step up?
They also moved up in 2017 but had to swap with Philly because Vlade needed cap space to sign Rajon Rondo.
"Rajon Rondo was a better passer. And had better handles. And better finish at the rim. So he could drive the paint, collapse the D and pass out of it - even though he was short."
Um ever heard of a guy named Zion Williamson or a guy named Rajon Rondo…
"Honestly, a better comp is peak Rajon Rondo, who remember was considered a very good defender, and an elite passer... but a pretty poor shooter."
"It doesn't have to be great though, just serviceable.  Rajon Rondo is a good example of this who has a similar profile to Simmons, just 9 inches shorter.  He was in the 60% range for FTs since forever, but his 3pt% started in the 20-28% range his first 7 years.  Then in 2015, he started to get better and every year since, he's been in the 33-36% range.  That's not elite by any means, but good enough that he isn't always left completely open on the 3pt line.  Yes, some teams do leave him open there at times, but he shoots it well enough to punish them.  That's all Simmons needs to do, shoot it just well enough that teams won't completely abandon him every possession."
Yup. Mann has/had a rookie Rajon Rondo card in his wallet since middle school I believe he said.
Rajon “Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis” Rondo
"Right. So you wouldn’t trade 5.5 assists for 5 points? If you’re saying “assists don’t always accurately reflect offensive impact” as a last ditch attempt to help justify your argument, I think you’ll be met with unequivocal support of CP3’s playmaking in that season. This isn’t Rajon Rondo being top 15 all time in assists, it’s a great playmaker carrying his team."
"Doncic’s greatness, so evident so early on, clearly compelled Carlisle to consider the changing hoops politics at hand. Since being hired in May of 2008, Carlisle has had his fair share of friction with key players, in large part because of his well-known tendency to be controlling. But Rajon Rondo, this was not.  In truth, it was far closer to the difficult dynamic that he’d successfully navigated with then-point guard Jason Kidd en route to winning the franchise’s first and only title in 2011. It took an intervention of sorts to get through that friction back then, when then-Mavericks assistant coaches Tim Grgurich, Dwane Casey and Terry Stotts stepped in to tell Carlisle that he needed to loosen the reins on Kidd. In the end, of course, it was a wise and necessary move.  The championship took Carlisle’s credibility to another level in those coming years. He was, with good reason, virtually untouchable when it came to the job insecurities that most coaches face. Such is life when you reach the NBA’s mountaintop for a franchise that has never been there before.  But as Doncic started to look more and more like a modern-day Dirk Nowitzki these past three seasons — the kind of once-in-a-generation player who the Mavericks could build around for the next two decades — the landscape that surrounded Carlisle began to change. And Carlisle, quite clearly, decided to change along with it.  “You can’t win against the next Nowitzki,” one source said.  Doncic has a healthy relationship with the Mavericks organization at large. League sources say he angled to be drafted by the team in 2018, and he has been particularly complimentary of his relationship with Nowitzki, whose final season coincided with Doncic’s first. Those feelings could change if the team’s postseason struggles continue, as the Mavericks haven’t advanced past the first round since their 2011 championship run. It’s not that Doncic’s situation with the team is at a critical inflection point right now. Multiple team sources simply fear that it’s heading that direction.  Those concerns mostly center on Cuban and the decisions he makes regarding who he trusts and imbues with power. Sometimes, it’s examples like Voulgaris, a sports gambler with no league experience being given near total control of the team’s roster. Other times, it’s the relationships he doesn’t sever: The Mavericks’ front office has come to be known around the league for its long-existing power structure that, Voulgaris aside, has barely changed.  Doncic has provided the Mavericks a chance to return to prominence. He’s a generational star the team was fortunate to draft, seamlessly taking the mantle from the franchise player before him. But after beginning another offseason sooner than hoped for, the focus falls upon the organization around him: on how the dynamic that existed over the past seasons was allowed to operate in such a haphazard manner, and whether it can be fixed before it’s too late."
"I guess from elsewhere in the league, he just looked like a cancer.   I was really excited about him coming into the league. I respect that he skipped college to play in Europe when the league raised the age for the draft. I feel like colleges really exploit their athletic talent.   But when he came in the league, I just saw all the same problems I saw in Marbury with not as much as the talent.   The kind of guy who can put up decent numbers on a lottery team but certainly not the guy you want running you're show if you are trying to compete. He always  seemed to look for his own shot first.   I remember when the trade rumours for Jennings to Detroit started, people were making a joke about how absolutely bad an idea that was and how it sounded like people trolling Joe Dumars for making another bad deal. [Dumars actually came out to deny the trade talks](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/joe-dumars-denies-trade-talks-for-rajon-rondo-brandon-jennings/).  Then it actually went through. It was a trade nobody wanted. And we gave hom Middleton in that trade!   The Detroit got Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings, and their ball-hoggery just totally fucked up the team entirely"
"CP3 has yet to face his truest, oldest, turtle-iest and toughest nemesis in these playoffs... Rajon Rondo. Rajon Rondo has heard this talk of Chris. Rajon is lying dormant quietly resting in this Utahn series. Trust me however, for I’ve seen this particular turtle work, and he is under the tension of the surface in his teammates ears. For they will beat Utah; it’s destiny. Rajon Rondo and Chris Paul will yet again battle in the playoffs for the glory they both think the other doesn’t deserve.   Godspeed Chris. This turtle isn’t an easy one to beat as you very well know."
you forgot rajon rondo
"Westbrook has literally never caused chemistry issues in his entire career, why would he start now? He already has a good relationship with PG, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he and Kawhi meshed well together as well.   He’s simply better at the game of basketball than any of the other guards on the Clippers, and his abilities fill holes that this Clipper team has. Their best passer right now is either a geriatric Rajon Rondo or Kawhi, that isn’t enough to be a truly elite team. Westbrook is a great playmaker that gets the most out of his teammates, he’d be perfect with the Clippers."
Can he use the fuel so that he could post up Rajon Rondo?
Clippers take game 3 at home with some big minutes from Rajon Rondo
"&gt;I don't know why you would try to ruin a good thing   I think if the Lakers had time to have a normal off-season they probably would have just run it back. But considering they only had 6 weeks off it's not difficult to see why the Lakers could have been wary about bringing back Dwight Howard (35 years old), Rajon Rondo (35 years old), Danny Green (34 years old), and Javale McGee (33 years old).   Bringing back the league's oldest team with such a short turnaround probably would have gone poorly also. After all, it's not like any of those guys are having a great playoffs for their other teams this year. The players who are playing best in these playoffs this year are the ones who were gone before the second round in the bubble, if they played there at all."
"I mean.   Ty Lue did go to the Zone, which got them back into the game.   You can't blame Ty Lue for Marcus Morris shitting the bed in both games, Paul George launching bricks until the 4th quarter in game one, or Kahwi disappearing in game 2 in the fourth.  What you can blame Ty Lue for is his line-ups and rotation. For a playoff team, the Clippers have no idea who is going to play in the game and how long they are going to play.   Luke Kennard   * Game 1 - 29 minutes / 18 points  * Game 2 - 10 Minutes / 3 Points  Rajon Rondo   * Game 1 - 28 Minutes / 5-5-6  * Game 2 - DNP  Patrick Beverly  * Game 1 - 6 Minutes 0-1-1  * Game 2 - 20 Minutes 3-3-1  Demarcus Cousins  * Game 1 - 3 minutes / 6 points  * Game 2 - 11 minutes / 6 points  Terance Mann  * Game 1 - 8 Minutes / 2-1-1  * Game 2 - 1 Minute  Nicolas Batum  * Game 1 Started - 20 minutes - 6/4/2  * Game 2 Bench - 27 minutes - 7/3/2  Ivica Zubac  * Game 1 Bench - 20 Minutes - 11 Points  * Game 2 Started - 13 Minutes - 7 Points"
He's never won a playoff series without Rajon Rondo on his team. He's never won a playoff series as the best player on the team.  He'll always be a #2 who needs a stronger player to be successful.

"We just haven't found *that* guy that synergizes with our core talent. We need a pass first player and/or a stretch big.   KP would mesh really well with our team (i think)   Kemba needs to be the focus of a team, not the other way around. Same for Gordon Hayward who is now thriving down in Charlotte. We need a Chris Paul or Rajon Rondo type player at the guard position, somebody who is okay with deferring the ball or somebody with a talent set outside of one dimensional scoring."

"there's 15-20 NBA teams that would've killed to have Ainge as the GM or to get even one of Tatum/Brown, let alone both.  Also everyone loves to forget that Ainge hit on Smart, Robert Williams, Al Jefferson, Rajon Rondo and more.  Oh yeah, he hired Brad Stevens, too.  The Kemba Walker contract was fine last year when he was an all-star but is aging poorly and unfortunately will continue to do so, and losing Kyrie for nothing hurts even if they didn't really give up that much to get him.  Horford looked cooked in Philly and Hayward was hurt again for a good chunk of this year (his contract also has a significant chance of being onerous by the end), all the hand wringing about him is pretty overblown and his credentials as a top GM are bona-fide.  Anyhow it's over now, the Jazz are very much not dead and I hope they beat the Clippers, I respect the hell out of Quin Snyder and Dennis Lindsey for putting together this roster &amp; getting the most out of them."
"The Clippers have won 4 of their last 5 playoff games with their best playmaker being Rajon Rondo. If you throw a playmaker on that roster, with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard being on such a roll, I can’t see how the Jazz would be able to compete.   The Jazz have an electric backcourt in Ja, Mitchell, Conley, and Clarkson, but none of those players are exceptional defenders and none of them are very big either."
Has never won a playoff series without Rajon Rondo so it's fairly obvious IMO
"I really have harped on this all over the subreddit, but Giannis literally needs a player who has extensive playoff experience in his ear. You can talk about superstars like KD, Chris Paul or Lebron, but obviously thats not happening. So you go down a tier to playoff performers like Danny Green or Rajon Rondo, the type of guys who have made a lot of deep playoff runs and know the mentality. Giannis has been the big fish in the small lake in Milwaukee and he doesnt have the mental on his own. He needs someone to guide him. Cause right now, he just looks defeated.   Mind you, maybe in game 3 he drops 50 and we all look stupid, but i have to imagine mentals are a bit hurt right now in Giannis’s space"
Rajon Rondo: “Hold my beer”
Rajon Rondo will probably make the Hall of Fame. Getting into the Hall of Fame is not really the accomplishment that the Football or Baseball one is.
"Man, my nephew (shout out r/NBA) has been gone goin on four years, and the Mavs push (big Dal sports fan) brought such bitter sweetness. I mean, I can't really put into words what it would be to geek the fuck out with him about Doncic.  I guess the only real thing I have to say is to try to let those thoughts of what you could have shared be joyous ones. I wouldn't see what's happened with the Mavs in the same way without having talked to him about how exciting it was to think about prime Rajon fuckin Rondo joining the Mavs for such a small package (uhhh....), celebrating with him in '11, and everything that went with it."
Isnt that rajon rondo?
"Hard to pull your weight when you're benched for Rajon ""Not Playoff Rondo"" Rondo"
"Here is an example:  https://videorulebook.nba.com/archive/legal-play-players-momentum-carries-him-into-backcourt-not-a-violation/  &gt; “This is an example of a legal play that would not be considered a backcourt violation. The defensive player, Rajon Rondo, makes the steal in his new frontcourt, but his momentum carries him backward one step into his backcourt, he then moves forward into his frontcourt legally. Again, this is a legal play and not a violation.”  Video example on the link*"
"Who said he's the second option? Tobias Harris is clearly the second option - no one (except maybe people who don't watch the Sixers) think of Ben as someone who's supposed to be the second option. Assuming you mean ""second scoring option"" which is how people use that term. Ben is more in the Jason Kidd / Rajon Rondo mold, except huge."
"I think there's a distinction between ""role player"" as in what you expect from like a 6th man and ""role player"" as in a non-superstar. For example, would I classify a guy like Chris Paul or Shawn Marion or Rajon Rondo as being a superstar at any points in their career? Probably CP3 for a few years there. But I could describe them as being exceptionally strong non-superstars which could be seen as ""playing their role"". Klay's archetype is a 3 and D guy. A lot of teams have good 3 and D guys but arguably no one better than Klay, especially in the scoring department. So if you exaggerate that, he becomes the best ""role player"" of all time."
You mean Rajon Rondo
Woah can't believe that dude met Rajon Rondo
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.

Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers?

Rajon rondo said no
Not good time right now for Rajon Rondo fans.
Laker great Rajon rondo with the travel!
Rajon rondo is an asset
i remember when rajon rondo spit on chris paul and lakers fans called cp3 weak for retaliating and not taking it. good times.
Rajon Rondo accepts this challenge.
Rajon Rondo says you are all over reacting
"*Start of Game 7*  Referee (about to initiate the jump ball): Before we start. Mind helping make a referee's night easier, gentlemen?  Chris Paul: *looks at Rondo*  Rajon Rondo: *looks at CP3*  *They run to each other. Fight ensues*  Referee: That's the stuff. Both of you, out"
"If I had to characterize my feelings about Rajon Rondo, I would say they are overall very negative."
Ahh the team of misfits:  Mr.Anthony “You’ll find me hobbling on the floor” Davis  Mr. Russel “I’m just jacking it” Westbrook  Mr. Carmelo “Don’t call me overrated” Anthony  Mr. Rajon “they call me tough” Rondo  Mr. Deandre “I just wanna be in LA eating veggies” Jordan  Mr. Dwight “I call myself Superman” Howard
"Suns sold or gave away Luol Deng, Nate Robinson, and Rajon Rondo. Wait, you said no one talks about... Nevermind. Suns fans won't ever forget these."
Related:  Trade 1: Suns trade the 21st pick in 2006 (Rondo) and Brian Grant and for a 2007 1st round pick (ended up being the 24th pick) and cash  Trade 2: Suns trade the 2007 24th pick (Rudy Fernandez) and James Jones for just cash  So in total: Across two seasons the Suns effectively traded Rajon Rondo (and gave up two other players) for just cash.
"&gt;Celtics also traded Joe Johnson after his rookie year  Alright, let me see if I can explain this one from Boston's perspective ... It was a win now move, they got Delk and Rodney Rogers in return, sounds terrible.  And it was a terrible deal ... BUT ... the plot thickens ... WITHOUT THIS MOVE THERE IS NO ""NEW BIG 3"" in BOSTON.  They are stuck with Joe Johnson and can't pay those 3 guys.  You want more?  Okay, let's look at Rajon Rondo, the PG who fit in so well during the Big 3 years as a facilitator.  After the Lakers traded the Rondo pick to the Celtics and the Celtics traded it to the Hawks, THE HAWKS TRADED THE PICK THAT WOULD BECOME RAJON RONDO TO THE SUNS FOR ... JOE JOHNSON!!!  THEN, THE SUNS TRADED THE RONDO PICK BACK TO THE CELTICS FOR THE PICK THAT WOULD BECOME RUDY FERNANDEZ!"
"yeah you gotta be like a superstar celeb to get bothered in NYC. even then, actual NYers don't really care. i saw rajon rondo at il mulino a few weeks ago. not a single person gave a shit. saw blake griffin at lola taverna. again, nobody cared."
"The Kings trading Jason Thompson, Sauce Castillo &amp; Carl Landry + picks (one first &amp; 2 swap rights) to Philly so they could clear cap space.  The Kings wanted cap space for Rajon Rondo, Wes Matthews &amp; Monte Ellis... except that Wes was using the Kings as leverage to get a better deal elsewhere (and he did from Dallas).  I believe the Kings ended up with Marco Belinelli as a consolation prize.  Those picks ended up being rather juicy, one of the swaps was used by Philly to trade up to #1 overall in order to take Markelle Fultz.  The hilariously #KANGZ pat is that they did this in advance of free-agency rather than waiting until they had commitments from their targeted players to dump salary.  Hinkie pantsed them pretty hard."
"The Kings traded a 1st round pick swap in 2017 and an unprotected 2019 1st round pick to cap dump Nik Stauskas, Jason Thompson, and Carl Landry to the 76ers in exchange for draft rights to two guy that never would come over.    They then used the cap space to sign Rajon Rondo, Kosta Koufos, and Marco Belinelli for a combined 26 million."
"Ben Simmons is 25. He has been an all-defense first-teamer twice. (He hasn't been a DPOY)  When Rajon Rondo was 25, he had been an all-defense first-teamer twice and a second-teamer once.  Why are you fighting this?"
Around 2009-2011 I used to argue that Rajon Rondo was the best pg in the league
Rajon Rondo &gt; Chris Paul
you... you do realize that you just described Rajon Rondo when he was the same age right?
Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo don’t deserve the amount of hatred they get
"Lebron, Russell Westbrook, AD, Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Deandre Jordan  Vs.  Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iggy, Harrison Barnes  Why is that questionable?"
"First things first, my point was that in 2021 we're better equipped as a community to help individuals with mental health issues. We're all somehow broken deep inside, nobody can be ""fixed"". It's just that we possess the knowhow to help people love themselves and deal with their internal wars better than we did 30 years ago.  Now, about Drummond, it's not about how many rebounds he grabs, it's also how many of those he wastes himself on awkward half putbacks. Rodman famously never went up for the putback unless it was a sure thing. It's not only that he grabbed them, he was super careful with where those extra possesions were going. It's the equivalent difference between a Magic Johnson showtime fastbreak assist and a Rajon Rondo 2 seconds left on the shot clock grenade assist. They both count the same, 1 assist, yet they're  organically different. Another point regarding that comparison is the trade-off between offensive and defensive rebounding (or in Rodman's case the ridiculous lack thereof).  As for luck, it's obviously the common denominator of every successful person to ever live. We cannot control it."
"Shaq and Bron would be the obvious answers at their position just based on physical ability, but honestly don't think either of them actually fight.    At C, I'd take the Big Chief, Robert Parish.  Not only was he a blackbelt, but at the end of his career he signed with the Bulls and actually told Jordan to shut the fuck up, and Jordan did.    PF- Kenyon Martin.  Kmart was nuts and not at all above throwing down.  Alternate, KG (but only if the opponent was a small european role player)  SF - Ron Artest got in a fight with the entire Detroit fanbase, and won.  Alternate, Xavier McDaniel -  Most of you younguns don't know the X Man, but he was a rough and tumble dude in the 90s.   SG - Vernon Maxwell or DeMar DeRozan.  Just depends on whether you listen to Kenny Smith or Vince Staples.    PG - Steph Curry.  hahahahahaha.  Ok, Probably Iverson, but alternates would be Mark Price and Rajon Rondo."
"As both A Grizzlies be Rajon Rondo fan, this comparison pleases me."
Ja Morant reminds me of Rajon Rondo if Rajon Rondo had a jet-pack
"Right before Rondo pulled the trigger, the fan said “I’m rubber, you’re glue”, causing the bullet to actually reflect off the fan and in fact hit Rondo.  Seeing as how Rajon is a literal gunshot victim now, the NBA didn’t see fit to punish him"
"What Rondo did is an asshole move, but you can't initiate physical contact with a player, period.  The guy clearly slaps Rondo's hands, that's an early exit even though Rajon basically instigated the altercation."
"They sold their draft picks from 2004-2007.  Some of those players being Luol Deng, Nate Robinson, Rajon Rondo."
"He didn’t “pay for an interactive experience” so why is Rondo sticking his finger an inch from the fan’s face? That isn’t a basketball play, he’s putting his hand out of bounds and it’s not to save the ball.  He’s going off the court to do it.  Most people that have respect for themselves would slap ANYONE’S hand away if they were holding it in their face, pretending that it’s a gun, and pretending to shoot you with it. Players can’t be allowed to threaten fans, or invade their personal space. That goes both ways. Rondo doesn’t get in his space, nothing happens.  And also, absolutely nobody is there to watch past his prime Rajon Rondo play basketball. They’re there for Lebron, AD, and Russ to watch them play the Suns."
"Rondo to Bill Kennedy (ref): ""You're a motherf--king f----t. ... You're a f--king f----t, Billy.""  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2599027-nba-referee-bill-kennedy-reveals-he-is-gay-after-rajon-rondos-alleged-slur"
Siding with Rondo was kinda weird. Do we know why Rajon did what he did? Was the fan heckling him?
"Or like Rajon Rondo didn't just put his hands in the dude's face. Maybe he was being a douche or heckling him or whatever but like I don't see anything wrong with slapping someone's hand away, regardless of who they are, if they do that shit"
"She said ""you put your hands on an NBA player??"" like Rajon Rondo was the president"
"They certainly haven't done anything to make their offseason look any better. I don't understand why Carmelo Anthony, Deandre Jordon, and Rajon Rondo are on this team?"
If rajon rondo did that to you you'd do the same exact thing and if you wouldn't you're bitch made
Lebrons most consistent shooter right now is Rajon Rondo. Yikes.
"No he FUCKING RUINED SSOL. Suns had Joe Johnson wanting like 6/36M extension and sarver said no. So he got the 5/70M bag from ATL and told Suns not to match. Suns traded Q Rich for cash. Only like 3 players played on both 2004-05 and 2005-06 teams. Suns had No 7 pick in 2004 and sarver sold it for cash to Chi who drafted Luol Deng but the Suns were going to draft Iguadala with that pick. Suns traded Rajon Rondo on draft night for cash. Suns traded Rudy Fernandez for cash. He traded Marion for a broken Shaq. He's the reason the Suns wasted so many lotto picks on athletic projects. He's why we drafted Ayton (anothern athletic project) instead of Doncic, the UA connection."
Not sure how Anthony Davis makes that top 75 team when his only success before being carried by LeBron was thanks to Rajon Rondo
"Does it count if you continued to hate him even after he was on your team, and only stopped when he randomly became your 3rd best player out of nowhere during a title run?  Because if it does, then Rajon Rondo."
PG - Rajon Rondo  SG - Demar Derozan  SF - Vince Carter  PF - Carmelo Anthony  C - Domantas Sabonis
Embarrassing is LeBron literally quitting on the court in 2010 after getting owned on both sides of the ball that whole second half by Rajon Rondo.
RONDO lmfao cmon Rajon Rondo Mr 1x all nba? I get it you're trying to be contrarian but get out of here with these takes.   Even if you watched him at his best in Boston you couldn't say he was better than Kyrie.
"He just won a title with noted floor spacers Rajon Rondo, and Dwight Howard."
How is Russ not just another Rajon Rondo
"#You have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, and Russell Westbrook.  Don’t matter if it’s the early 2000s or the early 2020s  #And you’re fucking losing."
is Rajon Rondo is pronounced Hajon Hondo in Brazil

"&gt; a couple of other first rounders sold for $3M a piece  Those picks became Rajon Rondo and Luol Deng, just FYI."
Or how they sold off the draft picks that were used on Rajon Rondo and Luol Deng.
"That would be ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as someone bailing on their country at the Olympics because they want to work on their shooting, so they spend their off-season working out with renowned 3 point specialist Rajon Rondo. I don’t see it happening. Just too stupid of a scenario."
"Height is important, but when you're under 6'3 or 6'4, some of that height can be mitigated by a longer than average wingspan.  Rajon Rondo is only 6'1. However, he has a 6'9 wingspan, which helps a lot defensively."
"And most of the moves made to win that chip wasn’t even thanks to genius thinking on his part:  1. Kyrie. The obvious No. 1 pick in his draft. Dan may be terrible, but even he isn’t that stupid to not pick him. Or that was what we thought until he picked Anthony Bennet 2 years later.   2. Love. A Love-Pick no. 1 (Wiggins) deal wasn’t some genius move Gilbert pulled out. It was already being discussed as a popular trade option the moment the Cavs won the first pick. All Dan had to do was to make the move.   3. Lebron. Cleveland is lucky as hell that this man was willing to come back after the shitshow they put him through. Dan Gilbert had *nothing* to do with this man coming back.   4. Supporting cast. Yes JR and Shumpert were good pickups but nothing too extraordinary. Tristan Thompson developed into a good starting C playing alongside one of the greatest playmakers of all time. Matthew Dellavedova wasn’t signed with “back-up PG on a championship team” mindset, so you can’t praise Dan for that.   And when you compare this to what the Lakers were able to do in the 2019 season alone, Gilbert pales in comparison. Signing guys like Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, and an *upgrade* in the head coaching staff, and resigning others like Alex Caruso was better than anything Dan Gilbert has accomplished over his 2 Lebron stints *combined.*"

The Lakers will struggle to make the playoffs and Rajon Rondo or Westbrook will be off the team by the trade deadline.
"Rajon Rondo has been a 35% 3 point shooter for almost a decade and teams still go under every Rondo ball screen, there's way more to it than that"
Lebron James: +17    Anthony Davis: -22    Rajon Rondo: - 30    Lol
But what you miss here is that Sixers fans aren’t asking him to become a great shooter. We’re asking him to simply *shoot the fucking ball* FOR SPACING. Rajon Rondo still puts up shots. Shit last year he hit some daggers in the playoffs. Because he understands that his team needs him to put in an effort at something he’s not naturally good at and risk embarrassment/being uncomfortable for the benefit of others.
"ben simmons can't shoot the basketball. move on from expecting him to be able to. it's so weird to me how people frame it as him not trying to get better, as if every fucking skill is just a linear path that you can improve upon. rajon rondo has a career TS% of fucking 50.1 lol, you think that dude hasn't tried to get better at shooting? some people just are never going to be good shooters no matter how much effort they put in. you can make arguments about how he needs to try in order to get better, but we've all seen the videos of him putting up shots in an empty gym. he clearly does practice it.  i know defending ben simmons is not en vogue right now and i don't want to go too far but it's absolutely absurd to me how people who have never even come close to playing in the nba can look at a guy who has never come into the season out of shape or missed games for a stupid reason and say that he doesn't try enough. what did he quit on? a team that has tried to trade him for several years? his coach who didn't back him (with an absolute softball question) just after he, as part of the team, lost a series and had his season end?"
Don't forget how he gave away the picks that became Luol Deng and Rajon Rondo as well.

Laker Legend Rajon Rondo
Umm dude come on i saw an Instagram video of him shooting threes with known shooting specialist rajon rondo /s
 &gt;Just little known players like Luol Deng and Rajon* Rondo ya know.  Wouldn’t keeping them been cheaper since they would have been on rookie deals?
"Despite being the same age and from the same draft class (3 picks apart), the primes of Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo never overlapped. They never appeared in the same all-star game."
"Chris Paul and Rajon Rondo combine into one person, Chrijon Ronul, and pull off some bs"
Rajon Rondo/Mac McClung/Wes Matthews/Trevor Ariza/DeAndre Jordan  That’s the Lakers garbage time lineup in this years game 6 finals clinching win.
"This shows a total lack of context to just put it like that. Here's how all the other key players shot in that game:  * Ray Allen: 3-14, 13 points  * Paul Pierce: 5-15, 18 points  * Rajon Rondo: 6-14, 14 points  * Kevin Garnett: 8-13, 17 points  * Pau Gasol: 6-16, 19 points  * Ron Artest: 7-18, 20 points  * Lamar Odom: 3-8, 7 points  * Andrew Bynum: 1-5, 2 points  * Kobe Bryant: 6-24, 23 points  Really only KG and Artest shot well in this game, it was a defensive slugfest. What mattered more was the points Kobe put up, as he scored 23 compared to only 79 by the Celtics collectively as a team. On top of that, in a game where everyone was struggling to score, rebounds were critical, and Kobe had 15 of them (Pau had 18, Pierce had 10, and nobody else from either team had more than 8)."
So you'd rather have Rajon Rondo playing over Ben? Isn't Simmons at WORST just a better taller Rondo? Isnt Rondo literally known for passing out of easy layups?
"The problem with Ben Simmons was always shooting, he had an all round game except scoring. Hes the opposite from most players that come to the draft. But he never developed his shot and worked on the rest of his game. I had arguments with people IRL about this and they couldnt accept that a PG like Magic couldnt work but they failed to recognise todays game.  The 76ers are built around Ben Simmons and Embiid. Joel can shoot and he can work in the post and adds range to the team while Ben is the play maker and the key defender on the perimeter. There is no player in the last 5-10 years you could replace Ben Simmons with other than Rajon Rondo who would fit perfectly with what they are doing. If Ben wasnt a cunt and pulled a finger out they would have won last year but he did the same thing he did in his first playoff run."
"If people are debating whether Rajon Rondo or Kyle Lowry deserve to be in the HOF, Chauncey has a marginally better resume than either of them. I think he's in."
"The Kings team with DeMarcus Cousins, George Karl, Rajon Rondo, Matt Barnes."
"Or even just attacking the rim aggressively.  Rajon Rondo and Giannis aren't jump shooters, but come playoff time they force the issue by attacking the rim again and again. Importantly, they aren't afraid to draw fouls and get to the line; even if they don't shoot well, they get the other team in foul trouble.  Ben's so scared of shooting a free throw he doesn't even bother."
"From the article I linked in my original post:  &gt;When the trade was first reported on draft night, it would’ve been tough to find anyone that liked the deal for the Celtics.   Then-ESPN analyst and writer Bill Simmons, a noted Celtics fan, set the tone for the reaction when the details first emerged during ESPN’s NBA Draft coverage.   “Gerald Wallace’s contract is terrible. It’s $30 million for three years. It’s a big contract to take on for three first-round picks that aren’t lottery picks,” Simmons said during ESPN’s draft coverage that year.   “My first reaction though, Paul Pierce drafted by the team in 1998, played the last 15 seasons, and was somebody I hoped would retire with the Celtics,” Simmons added. “That’s only happened a handful of times where somebody gets drafted, plays 15, 16 years with the same team and retires. So, just to see him another team will be weird. KG’s another guy who’s going to get his number retired.   “I thought this was 35 cents on the dollar. There’s no guaranteed any of those picks will get in the lottery. Look at what just happened with Oklahoma City. They thought they were getting this juicy lottery pick and it ended up being No. 12. \[The Celtics\] are gutting the team, and it’s not like they have salary cap flexibility because \[Rajon\] Rondo makes big money. Jeff Green and Wallace combined make $20 million next year. So, it’s not like they’re gutting the team getting to start over.”   Then-ESPN Celtics writer Chris Forsberg gave any Nets fans that may have been worried about getting Pierce and Garnett at such an old age assurance that they could still be integral parts to a title team.   “The Nets should be pretty good for the foreseeable future,” Forsberg wrote. “Three guys with rings are a nice return for what could be three late first-round picks — and, hey, if nothing else, Boston took Gerald Wallace’s contract off Brooklyn’s hands. There’s a lot to like in this deal for the Nets, and you’ll especially appreciate what they got when the playoffs roll around.”"
I can't miss an opportunity to say 'Fuck Rajon Rondo'
Kyrie shooting is 8  Kemba Handle is 7.5  Gobert Defense also 10  Rajon Rondo also 10  Blake also 10  Giannis is 9.5.
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"You guys already sent out Pat Beverley, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu for Eric Bledsoe, so that was $23 million in outgoing salary right there. All you'd have had to do was include Kennard and you'd have had the salaries to match on Westbrook instead of Bledsoe. Kennard gets DNP-CDs fairly regularly (even in the playoffs) so it's not like he's worth keeping over having someone like Westbrook. Personally I think Westbrook is better than Bledsoe and Kennard, but maybe you disagree."
[Rondo is likely not getting many minutes](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/9/22/22688713/frank-vogel-rajon-rondo-not-play-much-minutes-lakers-jared-dudley-role) per Vogel.
"I personally think AD is more parallel to KG. Both are versatile defenders. Great face up and midrange game. Better 2nd options than 1st options. Both have the same build and doesn’t necessarily dominate physically. To me, Giannis reminds me of a taller Charles Barkley/Tim Duncan hybrid.  unstoppable in transition, dominates you in the post, questionable shooting excellent help defender. Also, I think Luka is more like Bird because they aren’t necessarily the best athletes but controls the game in every aspect with a sweet shooting touch.   I would like to add that Hakeem and Embiid have similar playstyles.   De’Aaron Fox = John Wall  Jrue Holiday = GP  Prime Rajon Rondo = JKidd  CJ McCollum = Monta Ellis  Before anyone downvotes me, I am not saying they are at their levels. I am just saying they have similar play styles in my eyes. Feel free to disagree."
"    pg: Kyle Lowry -&gt; Rajon Rondo (2006)     sg: Duncan Robinson -&gt; Shai-Gilgeous Alexander (DR undrafted, using draft of rookie year 2018)     sf: Jimmy Butler -&gt; Kawhi Leonard (2011)     pf: PJ Tucker -&gt; LaMarcus Aldridge (2006)     c:  Bam Adebayo -&gt; Zach Collins (2017)  Feel like the only straight downgrade is Bam to Zach Collins. Spacing looks pretty rough, though."

Rajon rondo is the secret to championships
CHRIS PAUL VS RAJON RONDO CONFERENCE FINALS
"He doesn't improve, that's a fair criticism. He somehow is more reluctant to shoot, and a worse jump shooter, than he was as a rookie, that really isn't OK for an all NBA player.   If he wants to be some random defensive stopper, cool, good for him, enjoy your life and money. He seems to talk like he values being good and winning, and if that's the case, he just isn't getting it done. No one is asking for Steph Curry here, being Rajon Rondo or Aaron Baynes from outside isn't a crazy ask."
"I mean if you're just looking for a facilitator that can handle the ball and run the offense, just go get Rajon Rondo or CP3. Kemba was clearly not filling that role well enough given his injury history."
"I know that you Mavericks fans hate Rajon rondo but reading this news makes me appreciate him all the more. He has always been known to be a guy that defended rookies and put himself into developing them. Seeing more about how Carlisle treats his players, it’s so obvious to see a little more about why Rondo absolutely hated him. The same thing happened with the balls, but that was player on player violence."
"Tomorrow: Rajon Rondo retires, interested in Dallas coaching opportunity"
Pretty sure this was a whole thing with Rajon Rondo and Celtics home games back in the day.
"You need to start watching CP3, rajon rondo to understand what is a floor general lmao, Ben not even coming close..."
"Doc IS coasting so hard from that 2008 ring.  That 2008 ring that had FOUR future hall of famers (KG, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo)."
"He's a taller Rajon Rondo, except Rondo actually used to turn up in the playoffs and had some monster performances. You'd think a guy like Ben Simmons with his length and athleticism could attack the paint better than Rondo but he has like no touch whatsoever."
Tell that to Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard.

Clippers really traded Lou Williams and two 2nds for Rajon Rondo.
"Plenty of elite defensive point guards could take matchups on 6'7 superstars. Marcus Smart, Rajon Rondo, Jason Kidd, Jrue Holiday."
"Serge is there long-term as well. Kinda crazy how they still are running Pat Bev and Reggie as their primary playmakers and how they are still using Morris as one of the primary matchups for Luka. Bev can't create in the playoffs (Bledsoe syndrome). Morris can not guard Luka. It's like they learned nothing from the Bubble. Both the Clippers and Bucks disappointed last year, one team greatly changed their defensive philosophy and traded for a legit playmaker (now they look much better suited for the playoffs). The other scapegoated their coach and ran it back, adding Luke Kennard and Serge Ibaka (later Rajon Rondo). Yes, the Clippers lack draft assets, but it's almost like they hardly made an effort."
"If anything this playoffs show how poorly constructed the clippers are as a team. They are expecting pg and kawhi to score 30 on isos and also to be able to defense the other teams best player. 35 year old rajon rondo can't be your best bet against a 22 year 6'6 guard ,but having PG guard luka would definitely decrease his offensive impact look last years series ,and even if you do he isn't a luka stopper by any means. Ibaka has also been caught by his age already and the other option zubac is a non factor in the paint for their interior defense. The best they can do is stop switching everything on defense have kawhi on luka most possessions and have ty Lue draw some sets so it isn't as iso heavy"
"People hate the clippers because they have some of the most unlikeable personalities on the same team. Marcus Morris, Patrick Beverly,  Rajon Rondo and Paul George leading the charge"
"&gt; Rajon just led the Lakers  What are you smoking, Rondo was a bench player, Lebron led the Lakers as their primary playmaker. Rondo had a nice playoff run, but lets not be hyperbolic."
Rajon Rondo is not an elite playmaker to anyone with eyeballs.

"Going from Pat Bev &amp; Rajon Rondo to Kyle Lowry is a pretty massive upgrade, a starting caliber primary playmaker is definitely a major need on this team.

Ben Simmons is like some bizarre combination of Rajon Rondo and Drummond
"Literally half their team is shooting over 40% from three this season. It's kind of bizarre honestly.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2021.html  Like, Rajon Rondo and Reggie Jackson are both shooting the lights out. Who could have predicted this?"
"Yeah exactly, you guys will be fine once Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard and Danny Green hit their straps."
I have some serious issues with this list.  You put RAJON RONDO as your fav Celtic... Dude.  JOSH SMITH...

"? When you watch Lebron's teams stack every buyout guy and role player on vet mins they can? He literally had rajon rondo and dwight howard on vet mins while playing with a prime AD. Those miami teams were always loaded with good veteran talent. Same with the cav's, he always had the right shooters and right players around him. You're stretching the truth by a country mile."
"He absolutely has not been the main facilitator on all of his teams lmao in 2019 it was kyle lowry who was the main facilitator. With Kawhi they just gave him the ball at his spots and let him go to work. 2020 arguably yes, and he didn't do a great job at it, which isn't surprising considering that isn't his role. 2021 it has been paul george and rajon rondo by far. Kawhi doesn't even like to bring the ball up the court"
Rajon “Double Agent” Rondo
Notable homophobe Rajon Rondo does some gay shit???  Im shocked.
 Bulls Legend Rajon Rondo
"&gt;“I hope he shoots a lot,” said Cuban of Rondo. “I hope he takes more shots than any guy on the team from outside the paint.”  &gt;Rajon Rondo	7:01	2-2	2-2"
"""Fuck the Mavs"" - Rajon Rondo"
"Rajon Rondo is the reason the Clippers are at least making the WCF this year. If they hadn't made that trade and kept Lou Williams, Mavs/Jazz would eliminate them."
Paul George could learn a thing or 10 from Rajon Rondo in the playoffs.
Mavericks legend Rajon Rondo
This person sounds like Rajon Rondo to me
1.Kawhi  2. Paul George  3. Marcus Morriss  4. Zubac  5. Luke Kennard  6. Terrence Mann  7. Patrick Beverly  8. Rajon Rondo  9. Ibaka   10.Reggie Jackson
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"I tried connecting Jae Crowder to Rajon Rondo, R.J. Hampton to Aaron Gordon etc, players who were traded for each other but technically never played with eachother but it shows that they did, any way to fix?"
"He's a pass-first, defensive point guard. Sort of like an undersized Patrick Beverly on defense and a worse-finishing Rajon Rondo on offense. Super high motor, knows the scouting report but tends to gamble and size is an issue.  His advanced stats are OK. EPM and RAPTOR like him, LEBRON and RPM don't."
I can see the post on this sub: Rajon Rondo since Mark Cuban hoped he shooted more: 70/70/100
Rajon Rondo has more championships than your franchise.
"lmao where is rajon ""cp3 stopper"" rondo when you need him"
"Is it just me, or does Shroder kind of look like Rajon Rondo."
like 80% of the victories by NBA teams this year has been determined by 3 point shooting. play in eliminaiton games are exceptionally vulnerable to this variable. I don't necessarily believe rajon rondo would stop some of these shots from going down.
"Kyrie was on a top of the line defensive team, hello? The 2017-2018 Celtics were literally the best defensive team in the NBA. They were better defensively than we were. Kyrie got exactly 0 MVP votes and couldn't make 3rd team over Oladipo or DeRozan. He was also the clear second fiddle kn the team behind Tatum to the point that Kyrie started sulking and demanded a trade.   Sometimes I think this gets overlooked so I just want to repeat it. Kyrie has made two All-NBA teams. Since his career began he was overlooked for All-NBA in favor of such superstars as Demar DeRozan (twice), Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry and Rajon Rondo.  At no point since 2014 has Kyrie been the best player on his team. The top 7 players in the NBA could all miss an entire season and he would still not be a serious MVP contender because guys like PG, Dame and Butler are just better than he is. Kyrie has incredible skill, but he's not an MVP level player."
"When it comes to Robert Sarver this is legit news though. He's the owner that let Joe Johnson walk in free agency cause he didn't want to pay market value for him, and who simply dumped the first round picks that were used on Rajon Rondo and Luol Deng [because he was trying to save money:](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/347130-how-robert-sarver-destroyed-the-phoenix-suns.amp.html)  &gt; Sarver didn't want to spend money on first-round picks for four straight summers. Instead he sold, for ""cash considerations"" and future picks, the 2004 No. 7 pick (Luol Deng or Andre  Iguodala, who, ironically, they'd happily settle for now), Rajon Rondo (All-Star point guard for Boston), Rudy Fernandez (Spanish highlight film and fan favorite in Portland), Nate Robinson (three-time Dunk Champ; there's no money there?), Sergio Rodriguez (A backup point guard with skills? No way!), and two No. 1 picks (plus Kurt Thomas) for a conditional second round pick (I've never heard of that, by the way. What is a conditional second round pick?).   &gt; So there's another biblical tragedy spiral in all of that: Deng/Iguodala begat Rajon Rondo, who begat Rudy Fernandez who begat...you guessed it, cap space. (Seriously, that string of downgrading happened. Robinson, Rodriguez and Thomas were separate, though. Does that make Suns fans feel better? I doubt it.)"
The Hawks were better with Trae on the court than the Pacers with Sabonis on.  Does Sabonis deserved an all star spot becase of the Pacers killed everybody when Turner played without him while Trae was backed up by an uninterested Rajon Rondo ?
"He made 11 all star games although he missed 2 due to injury. He did start 3 all star games but 1 was as an injury replacement for Rajon Rondo, so he was picked by coaches at least 7 times in his career, you know the people that had to gameplan against him night in and out. Not sure how that equates to popularity contest."
You can’t compare the players Kobe got...Pao gasol to ray allen and Paul pierce and rajon rondo.  And you can’t forgive that Boston team from only winning once!!!

"Magic Johnson in '86-'87 had 6 games in a row with 15+ apg: 17, 19, 17, 15, 20, 16 (which were part of a 15 game stretch where he had 15+ 10 times).  John Stockton in '87-'88 had 12 games in a row with 15+ apg: 20, 17, 15, 16, 21, 19, 18, 18, 19, 16, 17, 18 (he also had 8 games in a row with 15+ apg to end this season: 16, 20, 26, 16, 18, 21, 15, 18.  These two runs were interrupted by a single game of 9 assists, so he ended the season with 15+ apg in 20 of 21 games).  John Stockton in '89-'90 had 8 games in a row with 15+ apg (to start the season nonetheless): 19, 15, 16, 15, 16, 18, 18, 18.  So from end of '88-'89 to start of '89-'90, there was a 29 game stretch where he had 15+ apg in 28 of 29 games.  Isiah Thomas in '84-'85 had 6 games in a row with 15+ apg: 19, 16, 17, 19, 18, 16.  John Stockton in '87-'88 had 5 games in a row with 15+ apg: 21, 21, 16, 15, 19.  Steve Nash in '07-'08 had 5 games in a row with 15+ apg: 15, 17, 18, 19, 15.  Rajon Rondo in '15-'16 had 4 games in a row with 15+ apg: 15, 15, 16, 15.  Tiny Archibald in '72-'73 had 4 games in a row with 15+ apg: 15, 15, 18, 19.  John Stockton in '88-'89 had 4 games in a row with 15+ apg: 17, 16, 15, 17.  Pretty elite company Westbrook joining."
"Why are you talking as if the Clippers are at 100% health and 0% rustiness? Serge Ibaka just came back tonight for the first time in almost three months. Tonight was the first game Rajon Rondo and Ibaka have played together, two of the most important rotation pieces on the team. Kawhi and PG have been dealing with nagging injuries the past month- Kawhi just got out of playing two games in a month. So no, it wouldn’t be good for the rusty, injured Clippers to play the Lakers with Lebron “still rusty” lmao. But whatever"
