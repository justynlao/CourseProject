"Isaac Bonga, Cassius Winston, Moe Wagner and 2 2nd round picks should do it imo."
The world’s not ready for him and prime Isaac Bonga
"&gt; Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len  oh my fucking god"
Did you see his teammates?? The starting lineup was Raul Neto Beal Isaac Bonga Jordan Bell and Robin Lopez... who else is supposed to fucking shoot lmao
"We missing like 6 key guys lol ... Beal was playing with a bunch of bad players who shot worse than him.   Like do you want Raul Neto, Isaac Bonga, Anthony Gill, Robin Lopez, Cassius Winston, Garrison Matthews, Jerome Robinson, Jordan Bell, or Alex Len taking those shots instead?  Neto, Lopez, and Matthews are probably the only players there that may get playing time if the team is healthy."
Sir I will not stand for Isaac bonga catching strays
"Ok, so where’s the fella in this sub that told me Isaac Bonga was better than Ingram?"
why didn't he pass to *checks his notes* *Jordan Bell*? or huh...*Isaac Bonga*?
"His best teammate tonight was either Robin Lopez or Isaac Bonga, there is no way to pin this loss on him."
It's the Isaac Bonga effect.
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
Isaac Bonga looks old for a 21 yr old
"Cap space is a state of mind.   Ok, just joking but there’s some truth to it. There’s always a way to maneuver shit about to get the space or contracts you need for a trade or signing. I can’t remember the last time a star player wanted to go somewhere and couldn’t because of the cap.  Lakers didn’t have the cap to trade for AD and sign Kawhi. Until they did. Cos they made some garbage trade of basically giving away Mo Wagner and Isaac Bonga for free and POOF, cap space.  If Ainge wanted to trade his precious picks for a star he could have figured something out.  Also not having tradeable contracts on him."
"Watching their games this year has been fascinating and infuriating   Entirely too much Jerome Robinson and Raul Neto (although Neto has been good). Especially when Brooks plays them next to Russ. Zero spacing.   Davis Bertans has basically been this team’s 8th option when everyone is healthy. I don’t think the front office signed him to that deal for him to be cast aside.   Troy Brown has disappeared, along with Isaac Bonga."
"I think a lot of the Brooks talk is just scapegoating, but the fact that he apparently fucking despises Isaac Bonga is just so strange. Bonga is legitimately the best wing player on the team according to impact metrics and he just gets DNPed"
Scott Brooks and our organization don't value defense. The last good defensive players we had were prime John Wall and Trevor Ariza. And now Isaac Bonga is benched benched
"Since I have nothing better to do, I will try my best to do every team the best I can  Atlanta: Trae, Collins, Capela, Hunter, Huerter, Reddish, Bogdanovic  Brooklyn: KD, Kyrie, Harris, Levert, Allen, Shamet, TLC  Boston: Tatum, Brown, Kemba, Smart, Pritchard, Thompson, Grant Williams  Charlotte: Lamelo, Graham, Washington, Bridges, Rozier, Hayward, Carey?

If Magic wasn't dumb enough to let him go for nothing he might still be on the Lakers and would be hated on by r/nba on the regular.  And yet he gave Isaac Bonga the longest leash ever
Isaac Bonga needs to be on Kyrie
"The Wizards have shooters. They aren't being utilized correctly. See below with 2019 3p % stats:  Bertrans (42.4%), Beal (35.3%), Neto (38.6% and 45% this season so far), Bryant (40.7%), Rui (28.7% but shooting 100% this year so far), Deni (NA but shooting 47.6% this year so far) can all shoot and probably in that order for efficiency  Then you have guys like: Troy Brown Jr (34.1%), Isaac Bonga (35.2%), Ish Smith (36.7%), Robin Lopez (33.3%), Moritz Wagner (31.3%), Anthony Gill (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason), and Garrison Matthews (NA but he can shoot from what we saw in preseason)  All these dudes can shoot too.  The problem is you need some semblance of an offensive scheme generating semi-open looks and the Wizards don't have that."
"I feel like it's at least somewhat understandable that they're sort of easing Avdija into his offensive role. Since there wasn't a ""Summer League"" for incoming rookies this year, he's still at fewer than 10 games since coming over between the actual season and preaseason. Obviously, he has plenty of professional experience but there is still a significant difference between the Israeli league and the NBA, so I can see them trying to let him get up to speed before asking too much in terms of playmaking.  To me, the more egregious misuse of personnel yesterday was the DNP-CD for Isaac Bonga. Bonga might be their best wing defender and yet he never came in while Otto Porter was shooting 10/14 on the night. I certainly don't think he should be starting over Avdija, but there's at least some minutes available in the rotation for him (especially when an opposing wing is scoring easily.)"
Yeah he was too busy checking lethal weapon Isaac Bonga
"Wizards should trade Jerome Robinson, Isaac Bonga and a 1st round pick for Lebron"
Mike Muscala or Summer League Isaac Bonga
"Analytically yes, Troy Brown Jr and Isaac Bonga are analytically good defenders. But leave it to Scott Brooks to bury them on the bench"
"Isaac Bonga, Alex Caruso and Andre Ingram have joined the room"
he’s talking about isaac bonga smh
Isaac Bonga
The disrespect to Isaac Bonga and Mo Bamba.
Isaac bonga
"1) Isaac Bonga (he is in the dog house)  2) Garrison Mathews  3) Jerome Robinson. Lol, he should be cut  4) Deni Avdija. Goofy looking European dandy who gets no respect from the refs and is oblivious to NBA foul drawing tricks as a rookie, and thus is much less effective than he should be    5) Raul Neto  6) Rui  ...  15) Davis Bertans"
"If westbrook is the other option? Yes.   Also For any wizards fans, what happensed to Isaac bonga? Isn’t he the best defender on the roster?"
"Hey Riley, Isaac Bonga, Mo Bamba, and Jahlil Okafor are a on the block. Make the calls."
Trade that bum KD for Isaac Bonga or Mo Bamba.
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
You're forgetting Isaac Bonga is the greatest small forward of all time
"Isaac Bonga.  Olynyk should grow full beard or if he can't, be clean-shaven"
"Lakers scouting is crazy (thank u jesse buss), we had dozier on the summer league team a few years back w/ josh hart, moe wagner, isaac bonga and thomas bryant (all ex-lakers on other teams now).  As Lakers scouting is good, our development is trash so im happy he's shining with you guys."
"He's not that much younger than the other rookies. He turned 19 the day of his first nba game which is pretty cool. I'd argue a lot of 19yo are getting the green light from tanking teams, infact poku doesn't even take that many shots compaired to the average rook in his situation. I took a quick look over the past few rookie classes and the only 19yo to shoot that poorly was Isaac Bonga and he only took like 30 shots that season"
"They are still a bad team because they've lost their 3rd best player to injury, their fourth best player was out of shape after signing his big contract and they have the worst coach in the NBA. But hey I guess Westbtook injured Bryant, forced Bertans not to train for 8 months and demanded to play in line ups with no spacing with Ish Smith and Isaac Bonga"
Why stop there? We need to include Thomas Bryant and Mo Wagner. Is Isaac Bonga still around? How about Svi Mykhailiuk?
Lmao kd getting the Isaac bonga treatment on those fouls
You know who has even worse ISO PPP?  Isaac Bonga. The guy you keep hyping up as someone the Wizards should've played for defense lmao
Isaac Bonga snubbed
Isaac Bonga looks like he's 40 but he's barely old enough to drink
"&gt;It would be Lebron, Kuzma, Caruso, THT, DLo, Josh Hart, Ingram, Nance, Lonzo, Randle, Clarkson and Thomas Bryant; rest would be guys on the min.  You forgot:  * De'Andre Hunter, the #4 overall pick who they traded for Davis * Ivica Zubac, who they traded to make room for Davis * Moe Wagner, who they traded for Davis * Isaac Bonga, who they traded for Davis * Jemarrio Jones, who they also traded for Davis -- but is a G Leaguer who makes no difference, just mentioning him for completeness  &gt;Very thin on big men  Not so thin when you include Zubac, and to a lesser degree Wagner.  If they somehow had all those players, they'd have the deepest roster in the league by far.  Hunter and Zubac both routinely start for playoff teams, and you didn't even include them.  Their bench would be a playoff team in the East.  The huge challenge would be finding minutes for everyone, and getting all these players to mesh offensively -- both are which are parts of coaching that Frank Vogel struggles terribly with.  Luckily for Vogel, with the most talent in the league, there would probably be many good choices on how to play them, so he might accidentally stumble across a few excellent lineups."
"&gt; So, it's not an asterisk title because your team won , yes?  No it's because the circumstances were nowhere near comparable. I can argue you had some advantages like a big rest between the season and the post season. Or perhaps players were cold because of that and not conditioned to play games. It could be either or. But my season was 100% normal and moved into the playoffs normally. We had fans in the stands, people yelling at our team, games on the road etc. You didn't... Not comparable circumstances AT ALL.  &gt; I'm not saying it's a fake title. But with your logic, it's like you're saying that your team's title is a fake title, which you just tried to justify that it isn't.  Because it's not lol. Aside from KD being injured how is that ring a fake title? I 100% justified I had to still run against a stacked team. It's not like I was playing a team of Christiano Felicio, some rookie, Isaac Bonga etc. I played against CURRY, THOMPSON, COUSINS, GREEN, IGUODALA. You are just upset because I called out how weak of a finals opponent you had to win that plastic Disney ring.  &gt; Bucks didn't step up in the playoffs ; Heat did.  Heat got lucky. They played a gassed out Celtics in the ECF who just finished a game seven series against the former champs. The Bucks I agree played like trash in the post season, but who knows why, they probs lost their form from the large break. The Heat also finished their first series against the Pacers who were cold except for T.J warren in four games. So yes, of course the heat got as far as they did they had the easiest run with minimal resistance. That team was the worst finals competition that LeBron's been up against in a LOOOOONG TIME, maybe the worst ever. I don't remember any rookies having to start for a lot of finals games aside from Ginobili but he's a HOF player, Herro likely won't ever be."
"If the crux of your argument is ""he should have played Isaac Bonga"", then I don't think you have a very compelling argument."
Mans played like Isaac Bonga for 4 games...
"I'm glad we got gafford ... but our roster sucks in general ...   We're deciding between starting Raul Neto, Davis Bertans, Isaac Bonga, Chandley Hutchison, Anthony Gill, and Garrison Matthews at the starting SF spot ..."
If we get Isaac Bonga minutes because of this game I swear to god
"Nah it was Isaac Bonga, stop the cap."
"Na, they're really really bad man. High effort doesn't mean high quality. That's okay though; I'm certainly never gonna tell a dude not to post, but a lot of them are just derivations of ""Scrub X had a good +/- in 4 minutes. Therefore we should clearly bench [insert established NBA starter here] for  him""  Like dude was advocating for Isaac Bonga to be a crucial player for the Wizards because he played the whole 2nd quarter against the Jazz and they won that quarter by 7 lol  They're all wild overreactions."
"Thomas Bryant, Isaac Bonga, Svi Mykhailiuk, and Moe Wagner have also been varying levels of good, especially considering their draft spots."
"Brooks has basically deleted Troy Brown and Isaac Bonga from the roster construction, and the lack of wings showed today. So I'd say there's more retardation where that came from."
Being a 7 footer does that to you unless your name is Isaac Bonga.
Isaac Bonga is definitely gonna be playing in Italy next year
Isaac Bonga
should have played isaac bonga or at least hachimura on tatum  literally anythingh was better than putting beal on him
"Lmao thank you, this kid is trying to tell me isaac fucking bonga was going to stop tatum"
"if isaac bonga scored 1,935 points, he'd be the second player to reach 2k points this season"
Isaac Bonga-lite
Isaac bonga has a zoro profile picture on instagram lol
Wizard legends Moe Wagner and Isaac Bonga (Even if Bonga didn't play)
We submit   - The “Latvian Logjam” Davis Bertans   - The GOAT *Raul Neto*   - Isaac “Bongo Drum” Bonga  for All Star Consideration.
How has Isaac Bonga not been mentioned yet? [That dude looked like a geriatric at 19](https://www.google.com/search?q=isaac+bonga+old&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY1dSy48PxAhWyoK0KHUJ_DfoQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=isaac+bonga+old&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQAzIFCAAQzQI6BAgAEEM6AggAOgYIABAIEB46BQghEKsCUKqcAVjVoQFg-6IBaABwAHgAgAGaAYgB2QWSAQMwLjWYAQCgAQHAAQE&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=irTeYJjoGbLBtgXC_rXQDw&amp;bih=720&amp;biw=414&amp;prmd=niv&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS795US795&amp;hl=en-US#imgrc=Wwb3iIlqFjYy0M)
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Isaac bonga literally has zoro from one piece as his instagram profile picture lol
Isaac Bonga/Chimezie Metu/Jevon Carter. An unstoppable trio.
"Notably, he also left simmons off of his all Nba team and put Westbrook on the third team. But Jokic was first team for him. So his all-nba ballot isn’t even consistent with this MVP voting.  He also voted for Schroeder and Theis for All defense second team. I believe there are only 5 active German players - those two, Maxi Kleber, Isaac bonga, and Moritz Wagner. Bonga and Wagner basically don’t get minutes.  So he also voted for 66% of the eligible German players for the all defense team (no one else gave theis a vote and I think only one other person voted for Schroeder).  His Twitter feed has basically nothing about basketball other than his about info that says he is based in LA covering US sports for a German publication. But his entire feed is like soccer and slalom and stuff.  Feels like this dude should bit have an NBA vote. There’s plenty of intentional media guys who are way more dialed in."
"I hope we are worse so they finally decide to trade Beal and start an actual rebuild, but I'm not holding my breath.   Realistically, I see them being about the same, ie fighting for a play in spot. Depth is good and all, since we won't have to give serious minutes to bums like Isaac Bonga and Chandler Hutchinson, but we are lacking top end talent, which is what actually wins you games in this league."
Isaac Bonga
"1. If your star player doesn't want to leave, you probably don't trade him 1. Some teams their goal is to make the playoffs. 1. Probably a 8-10 seed, but IMO the team is still better than last year   - Scott Brooks being gone improves the team a lot ... he single handedly lost many games last year.  - We started Raul Neto in the playoffs last year ... Regardless of what you think of Kuzma ... he's better than Raul Neto ...  - Actually we started a lot of players ... who aren't going to be in the league next year or .. are bench warmers like ..... Alen Len, Mo Wagner, Jerome Robinson, Isaac Bonga, Garrison Matthews ... etc. Depth was a big problem.      I actually think Wizards are set to be a pretty good regular season team ... Players like Harrell (Clippers) /Dinwiddie (Nets) were able to play major roles on mediorce rosters that got to the playoffs ... now they get to do it with a player like Beal.   There's promising young players on the roster like Hachimura, Avdija, Gafford, Bryant, and Kispert ... so its more about consistently winning. Like the oldest player on the roster is 28 ... there's plenty of room to grow."
Lakers legend Isaac Bonga
"&gt;Position: Small Forward and Point Guard  &gt;27% 3pt% last year  &gt;The most exciting thing about Bonga is his size and his potential to be a really good versatile defender. **He has the baseline ability to take the ball up the court and initiate** but can also operate as a wing.  And  &gt;The Wizards will not issue a qualifying offer to Isaac Bonga, thereby making him an unrestricted free agent, reports ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski (via Twitter).  &gt;The **6’8″ point forward** saw his playing time cut nearly in half"
"Isaac Bonga was playing, and no nba team is signing him"
Isaac bonga too.
"Got rid of Westbrook's contract which gave us cap flexibility and a way to Kickstart a rebuild in case beal does want to leave while simultaneously getting a lot deeper. Instead of giving big minutes to Isaac Bonga, Mo Wagner, Jerome Robinson, etc. those minutes can go to actually good NBA players. At the same time they gave up hardly any actual assets to do any of this so it's a pretty big win in most people's eyes."
You thought that was weird? Imagine having a Washington team so terrible people stanned Isaac Bonga in our Reddit  If you're reading this don't worry I'll give you time to look up who that is
And Isaac Bonga.
"he’s also 28, the only players under 25 on the german team i believe are mo wagner and isaac bonga"
Just an easy Kendall reference tbh. Didnt expect it to have 4000+ upvotes.  Shouldve said Isaac Bonga since he got bumped after Kuz arrived lol
"Just one? Isaac Bonga, Mo Wagner, Jon Williams from the AD trade.   How many of those crap players do you still have?  Let’s face it… Wizards will continue to take crap from the Lakers."
"I’d add Isaac Bonga to one of these lists. He’s 6’8” so I want to say SF because he’d probably end up guarding wings, but he’s a point guard, so idk."
"Look at the Lakers non-lottery picks here. THT, Kuz, Hart, Nance, etc. Only 2 out and out bad picks.  46	LAL	Talen Horton-Tucker 25	LAL	Moritz Wagner 39	LAL	Isaac Bonga 47	LAL	Svi Mykhailiuk 27	LAL	Kyle Kuzma 30	LAL	Josh Hart 42	LAL	Thomas Bryant 32	LAL	Ivica Zubac 27	LAL	Larry Nance Jr. 34	LAL	Anthony Brown 46	LAL	Jordan Clarkson"
Dont forget Isaac Bonga
"Westbrook and beal plus Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, and Isaac Bonga"
"They plan to build around their new team. Presenting the ~~Lakers~~ I mean, the Wizards. Built around former Laker players.   PG: 22nd pick   SG: Caldwell Pope   SF: Isaac Bonga  PF: Kyle Kuzma  C: Thomas Bryant      6th Man: Montrezl Harrell"
Isaac Bonga
I think the main reason he gets talked about is because he’s good. Why did Isaac Bonga or Mo Wagner not get massive media coverage?
But hes playing like isaac bonga
"I think people really do not understand the people that we were trotting out last year, especially compared to this year.   We were getting frustrated at a coach who instead of putting out a 3-guard  lineup, we were clamoring for him to put in Isaac Bonga and Garrison Matthews. I love those dudes but c'mon, Bonga is fighting for a 15 spot on the Raptors and we were hoping that he would play big minutes for us last year."
One Isaac Bonga coming right up
"I'm sus of Isaac Bonga as well. Dude looks older than 21. Moves gingerly, too."
"Right, but why did Bagley get the benefit of the doubt, relative to say, Isaac Bonga?   Was it because of counting stats or draft position, or something else?"
He edited it. He said Isaac Bonga the first go around. And he even misspelled it on the edit. Get it together u/C-P-R!
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
Yeah: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.raptorshq.com/platform/amp/2021/8/11/22620972/nba-free-agency-2021-toronto-raptors-reportedly-sign-isaac-bonga. There’s a good chance he’s waived before the season starts though.
Isaac Bonga is an elite name too
"Westbrook was the reason we made the playoffs, but he also did play us out of games.  People also underestimate depth ... last year were starting players like Mo Wagner, Alex Len, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga, and Jerome Robinson...       Trading Beal would have been the better option imo... because I don't think you have much room to make the roster better once Beal is making close to 50M a year..."
"Dennis Schroeder, Isaac Bonga, Franz Wagner, Mo Wagner, Daniel Theis  Could be a pretty solid national team?"
"Why aren’t the raptors using the player that hurt the wizards the most last season, isaac bonga."
disrespect for Isaac Bonga
Raptors future finals mvp Isaac Bonga tyvm.
fair to say westbrook was carried last year by **ISAAC BONGA**
"You're only considered in the tax after the regular season is over. Toronto is going to make a deadline trade to get under, this is widely understood over here.  Raptors could've gone with one less roster spot and been under the tax, but they kept Isaac Bonga which put them over. Isaac Bonga will play less than 100 minutes the whole season, they obviously would have cut him if they felt they needed to in order to get under."
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."
I want Isaac Bonga or Mo Bamba damnit!
So Isaac Bonga FMVP…
"The Raptors signed Isaac Bonga this summer and whenever I see him, he is strikingly ugly. Hope he makes the team tho."
"Yes because points scored and single game plus/minus are soooo insightful into how someone played. Isaac Bonga was a +9, I guess that makes him our best player in all of seven minutes, except he scored zero points, so maybe not? I mean he was only matched up against endgame scrubs while Barnes was tasked with guarding Tatum all night…       Watch the game before making yourself look silly."
"FINALLY, we've reached the Isaac Bonga/Bruno Fernando portion of the evening."
Isaac Bonga
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
it might have been one of the players that they signed recently like Alex Antetokounmpo or Isaac Bonga that haven't gotten the second shot.
You mean Isaac Bonga?
"I guess, the same way Isaac Bonga adds more depth to our PF position."
"Shooting 35% for his career on 2 threes a game isn’t being able to knock down the open three. That isn’t any meaningful form of floor spacing.   I’m telling you man, I’ve been here before. Ask any wizards fan about Isaac Bonga and how he was like top 5 in Defensive Raptor or some other advanced stat  and how he could hit open corner threes and push the ball in transition etc etc  Now the Wiz are good again, and where’s Bonga? Sitting at the end of the Raptors bench.   This is what fans of shitty teams do. I’m a wizards fan. We do it more than anyone else. Y’all have been good for like 4 decades, I understand this takes time to get used to."
Got any room for Isaac Bonga?
"The Wizards won an additional 9 games in the 2021 season compared to 2020. That year they started IT for 37 games, a guy who quite frankly is not an nba player at this stage of his career. The others were a combination of Ish Smith and Isaac Bonga if i recall correctly, the only legitimately good player here is Ish Smith but even he is more of a back up PG  The Wizards upgraded from the likes of Isaiah Thomas to Russell Westbrook and only won an additional 9 regular season games. I don’t get why this is lauded as all that big of an accomplishment"
Cuz we're too busy talking about Isaac Bonga
isaac bonga and maxi kleber right
Don't you mean Isaac Bonga
Year one he didn’t play w/ another “Superstar”  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac
"No he's on the Raptors now, but he played quality ball for us for 2 seasons.   I remember how we got him. To free up space for Anthony Davis, the Lakers traded Isaac Bonga, Moe Wagner, and Jemerrio Jones to the Wiz for cash considerations. Jones was released immediately, but Bonga and Mo became decent players for us.  Then, Mo was involved in the package that got us Daniel Gafford.   Tommy Sheppard is a genius"
Do y'all still got Isaac Bonga? Whatever happened with him. I remember when the Lakers picked him he was a very interesting project player
"I mean you also have to look at the fact that we have :  KCP, Kuzma, and Harrell replacing .... Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga/Chandler Hutchison, and Alex Len/Robin Lopez  And WUJ replacing Scott Brooks ..."
