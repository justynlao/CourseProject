Anthony Davis doesn’t have one either. Proof that sneaker execs hate people with unibrows?
"He was supposed to be on the 2012 team but injured his knee. He was replaced by Anthony Davis, who had yet to play an NBA minute."
"We have seen Looney provide great minutes in the NBA postseason as a primary defender on Anthony Davis. I'd hesitate to even compare the two; and Chriss does not play like a traditional C in that his strength is as a switch defender; very much lacking as a rim protector or positional defender. Chriss also lacks IQ of Looney in knowing where to position himself defensively, nor does he have the instinctive chemistry with Steph as a screener and ball mover. If that is the guy you're relying on the solve the Warriors issues at center it speaks to a larger failure of a roster that is wasting Curry's prime years with unreliable players who are not ready to contribute to a playoff team.  Because Smiley is literally on the roster and preventing the Warriors from addressing the problems of their roster. Hence why I criticized the roster. He is a part of the problem at hand. Oubre and what the Warriors are paying in lux tax for him is a problem too."
[Serious] Is Kyrie Irving better than Anthony Davis
Yeah. Lebron. Anthony Davis. and Alex Caruso.
Jason Kidd played against Moses Malone and Anthony Davis   Moses was drafted in 74 and Davis 2012 that's almost a 40 year difference
"Made sure the Anthony Davis fiasco ended with all the involved parties walking away happy.  Both Pelicans and Lakers moved up and got picks they had a less than 10% chance of landing. Lakers could finally put together a package to beat the Celtics offer, and Pelicans got the next stud they could rebound to and forget that the Lakers poached AD away."
"Oh boohoo, championships only matter when you're the underdog? What an utterly pathetic perspective. God forbid the guy who tried to put Kawhi and Anthony Davis on the same team have to go up against an equal team. Love watching ya'll change your exact same logic when you don't like the outcome. shit never gets tired to me lol"
"Wrong.  Top 10 in order and if you disagree you’re wrong.  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić"
"Anthony Davis hasn’t been better than Kawhi, Embiid, Steph, or Harden"
Anthony Davis wishes he was a 0 time NBA Champion

"I thought the same for a while.  But the only player I continuously marvel over while watching the Lakers defense is Caruso.  Almost every single game this is true.  Yes Anthony Davis is a better defensive player than AC, but I guess I've come to expect that daily from the brow.  Lots of people think the Lakers are doomed against really good backcourts, but Caruso and KCP (and Dennis for PGs) are really good defenders who can at the very least trouble some of the better players while AD and Bron go to work."
 I kinda agree. I don't think that players should have to spend 7 years and build loyalty with a fanbase they don't like. If you want out you either be an Anthony Davis or you get Nerlens Noel'd
"2017- Nurk comes in late season trade, prior to that their 3rd option was *checks notes* Mo Harkless? Lose to the greatest team ever assembled   2018-  Stotts lets Dame get trapped at half court all series with no real secondary playmakers (Pels weren't trapping off CJ). Dame definitely has some blame in this one  2019- Takes team with Meyers Leonard starting to WCF, runs into Warriors again where they unfortunately give up big  leads in each of the last 3 games  2020- Injury-riddled season for a team with a poorly constructed defense, runs into a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis    The list of guys who could have done any better given these circumstances is VERY short"
Somebody better sign Tucker to shut down Anthony Davis should they run into the Lakers in the playoffs.
"We're in a league where Anthony Davis is a second guy. You think Damian Lillard can be the #1 guy on a contending team??? Yikes, dog..."
"&gt;Like bruh he is the team’s offense, he can’t lock down the paint every possession too  Joel Embiid is Philly’s offense as well as our defensive anchor. This isn’t a knock on Jokic, he’s arguably the MVP front runner right now (not LeBron) and rightfully so.   He looks like he can actually keep pace with the flow of the game now and it’s amazing to see. His offense is tremendous, more than enough to warrant serious MVP consideration, but we can’t say he can’t play defense. He can. It just looks like he’s choosing offense over defense. Can’t totally fault him for that as you can tell by OP stats, but I think it means something, definitely when you have to get by Anthony Davis in a seven game series more likely than not to make the finals"
"Bradley Beal, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Zach LaVine, Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic, CJ McCollum, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, James Harden, Collin Sexton, Zion Williamson, Christian Wood, Brandon Ingram, Jerami Grant, Gordon Hayward, Devin Booker, Malcolm Brogdon, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Vucevic, Julius Randle, Anthony Davis, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, De'Aaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell (Bam Adebayo, DeMar DeRozan, and Pascal Siakam are all above 19.5).   How many players there aren't ""real"" 20-point scorers? All of them have done it before."
Pleasant: Talen Horton-Tucker (albeit in very limited minutes)  Unpleasant: Anthony Davis free throws
"Try reading your own comments. You said:   &gt; Ok, so then I can spin this back on you and say that Anthony Davis is only 2 years away from requesting a trade from the Lakers **if they don't build an adequate roster around him in the event that LeBron suffers a serious injury and is never the same player anymore.**   Player movement is not done for a while, you just hope it is lmao. There will be significant movement every 1 or 2 years due to the length of contracts. Nobody in 2018 thought Kawhi would be gone by 2019."
"Anthony Davis is never going to leave the Lakers for a couple of reasons:  1. LeBron is the GOAT and is going to have Brady-esque longevity and play at a high level into his 40s  2. Whenever LeBron does decline, the Lakers will still be an appealing destination no matter how inept their front office is because they are the fucking Lakers and they already have an incumbent star in place, they'd get somebody else, whomever it is.   I understand that this is a player movement league, however players leave if their situation isn't good enough and they don't have enough talent around them. That's not going to happen in Boston as Tatum and Brown have each other. They are the JV Clippers, how far that gets them in the playoffs, I have no idea, but your chances of keeping a star player increase exponentially when you have another one on your roster.   There's a good chance that the player movement in the NBA is done for awhile, all of the consensus 15 best players in the league right now aren't likely to switch teams in the near future:  LeBron, Giannis, KD, Kawhi, Harden, Steph, AD, Jokic, Luka, Embiid, PG, Jimmy, Tatum, Dame, Kyrie, I'd say none of those players are going to switch teams within *at least* the next 2 years, if not longer.   The only players of actual importance that might switch teams are Beal and KAT, that's it, and why? Because they are on lone star teams."
"Anthony Davis is not leaving the Lakers even in the worst case disaster scenario where everything falls apart for them. He's not going to the Bulls or wherever else rumored to go, he's going to be a Laker for probably the rest of his career.   Look dude, if you want to be an obnoxious Laker fan and try and troll the Celtics fans, your better argument would be that Tatum + Brown never win anything in the 10+ years they spend on the Celtics due to Danny Ainge's unwillingness to trade future assets, and misguided loyalty to Brad Stevens, as opposed to Tatum + Brown are likely to leave.   Tatum + Brown staying together for 10 years and never winning anything is more likely than Tatum + Brown leaving the Celtics in the next 3-4 seasons."
"Ok, so then I can spin this back on you and say that Anthony Davis is only 2 years away from requesting a trade from the Lakers if they don't build an adequate roster around him in the event that LeBron suffers a serious injury and is never the same player anymore.   Do you realize how stupid that sounds?   I don't expect Anthony Davis to leave LA. I don't expect Kawhi Leonard or Paul George to leave LA. You shouldn't expect Jayson Tatum or Jaylen Brown to leave Boston."
"Anthony Davis on his “Favorite before the NBA moment”: It was seven minutes of an ass spankin’ he was giving me. He had 17, all on me. I got dommed. I came so fast."
"When Jokic was drafted, they called him a power forward. He plays with guys like JaMychal Green who can play 5. Not to mention, Anthony Davis refuses to be called a center. So I think the person who deserves it most should get 1st team regardless, if we’re following last year’s precedent."
"What other fours except Simmons are like him though?  The modern 4 is more like a Anthony Davis, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kristaps Porzingis, etc"
He has been taking a lot more jump shots this season. Whether that’s due to the short turnaround or injury I don’t know. But still not concerning. It’s not like Anthony Davis just became in the playoffs. He consistently played great through most of his career other than injuries.
"One Anthony Davis, please."
Welcome to the Pelicans’ fanbase. We run on logic. That’s why Jrue Holiday is more loved than Anthony Davis.
"Lakers fans truly are the worst. You could literally do this to any player. If I told you that Davis is having one of his lowest scoring and rebounding years and failed to crack 20 points from the 12th of January to the 21st of January, despite being LeBron's second option, that would make him sound fucking awful, but that isn't how this works. Its clear that Davis is important, even if he has a bad game. Its the same with Gobert. Plus, if you watch the game, you can see that Jokic just dominated, regardless of who or what was in front of him. That happens from time to time. It happened to Donovan and Jamal Murray in the playoffs. This is one of Gobert's best seasons, and even if he has this one bad game, he has still proven himself to be a defensive force.      Let's do this for your best player and see if I sound like a babbling idiot. Ready? Here goes.          ""On the 18th of January, Lebron, who is supposedly an MVP candidate and frontrunner, played against the Golden State Warriors, a fringe playoff team at best. Lebron scored only 19 points, only got 5 assists, and 5 rebounds on 37.5 percent shooting. Lebron, despite being seen by many as the greatest basketball player ever, put in a terrible performance, but in spite of his poor play, the Lakers still won, thanks to the efforts of the best player on the team, Anthony Davis.""            See, I sound like a fucking idiot, and you do too."
Anthony Davis vs that front court?   Mitchell vs that backcourt defense?
Do y’all think Beal can be the second best player on a team that wins the finals? Like if you switched him for Anthony Davis when Lakers won or Lowry when the Raptors won a year ago?
"Yeah, he did about as well as any 7 footer not named Anthony Davis could be expected to guard Dame."
"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
"A few yrs ago Anthony Davis dunked hard on Ron Baker... annihilated him. Total poster. Gave him a black eye. A few days later someone asked Baker about trying to contest a shot by someone so much bigger and stronger..they asked him something like ""*why would you do that?*"".. And his reply was something like ""*It's my job*.""  Any player that tries to avoid being posterized should not be in the league."
They should call all minor injuries the “Anthony Davis.” Literally unable to put weight in the leg . Come back yamming a dunk next play.
This is coming from a Sixers fan as you can obviously tell so let’s say the Lakers offered us Anthony Davis for Joel Embiid straight up I wouldn’t do it.
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.   Top 10 players in order:  Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić."
My team-  QB Jokic  RB Russ  WR LeBron  WR Giannis  Slot KD  TE Zion  RT Anthony Davis  RG DeMarcus Cousins  C Steven Adams  LG DeAndre Jordan  LT Gobert  DE Kawhi  DE Nurkic  DT Embiid  DT Dwight   LB Draymond  LB Butler  LB Jaylen Brown  CB Wall  CB Jrue  FS Lowry  SS Smart
Lmao yeah Bam and Dragic are better offensive first options than Anthony Davis.
Anthony Day-To-Davis would spend the whole season on IR though
"Zion would be the best defensive end in the league. With his glue hands he might also be the best tight end but DE is where he would shine. Anthony Davis would not last a single practice let alone a game. He is not built for football, especially not at the TE position. He can't take those hits."
"Anthony Davis on the ground protecting his nuts, name a more iconic scene."

"RemindMe! 8 years ""Is Anthony Davis still in the NBA?"""
"I mean, ya can't compare him to Jokic.  Jokic isn't a normal ""modern big.""  He is entirely unique even today.  To me, Anthony Davis is a much better example of a perfect ""modern big"" and KG was very much in that mold.  A perfect ""modern big"" is good inside, can stretch the floor, can rebound, can make plays for others, and anchor the defense while being versatile enough to guard the perimeter.  Like AD, or Ayton, or Embiid, etc.  KG could do all of those things, and did consistently.  More than Amare for sure.  That's the part that doesn't make any sense, even t'wolves KG was more of a ""modern big"" than Amare."
"Ya, Wood isn’t going to be dropping 30+ every game against former DPOY Marc Gasol and Anthony Davis. That paint aint getting scored on, plus there’s LBJ with his playoff defense. 25 y/o CW aint it. but yes, those la guys can get red hot every game. HOU with Harden and Dipo would be swept or mercy swept"
"That’s exactly why Bud needs to switch it up. In any other season our defense would be amazing, like it was before the Bubble.  But we’ve seen the likes of Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis, Donovan Mitchell, Damian Lillard, etc all improve as a product of the bubble and the Bucks are caught in the cross-fire.  The heat are an excellent shooting team, but they do not hit those many threes when there’s fans, especially as the Bucks have HC advantage"
RIP Anthony Davis III
"&gt;Anthony Davis put up better efficiency numbers than that for years in New Orleans, yet no one would say that guy was a top 5 player in the league.  What? Anthony Davis was consistently regarded as one of the best players in the league.  &gt;Even now Davis is still looked at as a robin to another alpha personality in order to win a championship.  Because it's fucking Lebron James?   &gt;Dominique Wilkins  Is a hof of player?? Has everyone gone fucking mad? You're criticizing Luka here because you don't think it's that impressive that he's putting up Hall of Fame numbers in all 3 seasons he's been in the league?  Look man, I get that there are plenty of reasons to criticize Luka, same with Trey, but don't fucking straight up lie or exaggerate to make your argument. This is some dumb ass shit man."
"Anthony Davis put up better efficiency numbers than that for years in New Orleans, yet no one would say that guy was a top 5 player in the league. You make your name by going deep consistently in the playoffs and then winning a championship. Even now Davis is still looked at as a robin to another alpha personality in order to win a championship. A lot of guys in NBA history have put up big numbers for years, go look at Adrian Dantley's numbers or Dominique Wilkins numbers in his prime. Plus in my previous statement, I literally said the numbers Luka is putting up are superstar caliber, but you're such an emotional fanboy you missed that bit."
The hopes of Anthony Davis Jnr died in this play
Anthony Davis has screamed every offensive possession this game
Anthony Davis ain't gonna have no little Davis's
Nice to see Anthony Davis having his daily season ending injury
"Anthony ""i suck right now"" davis with the double double in  16 mins"
Christian Wood is Anthony Davis combined with Kevin Durant. GOD MODE
We were trending towards small ball earlier. Then the Lakers went to three straight finals with gasol Odom and Bynum for two of them. Teams needed to match up. Say what you want about Bynum passion for the game but he was skilled offensively. Dealing with 2 7’ and a 6’10 guy was hard. Then Dallas beat them from attrition over the years with a small lineup.   An Anthony Davis will have a place in the league. Embiid. Jokic. Being 7’? Maybe not so much
100% agree. Durant and George play with teammates too good to even be on consideration for most writers but James is fine playing with Anthony freaking Davis.
"Lol there was a stretch from 2014-2016 when the All-NBA First Team centers were Joakim Noah, Marc Gasol, and DeAndre Jordan. Those are all good players, but compare that to the last few years: Anthony Davis, Jokic, and one of Embiid/Jokic this year. Definitely a huge upgrade in top-tier centers."
"I think the talent pool of the center position was really poor. I remember watching the Inside the NBA guys make all decade teams for the 2010’s. At the guard you have Kobe and d wade on the back end of their career, but then you have 3 players who arguably are top 5 easily top 10 at their position ever in CP3, Harden, and Curry. You have Lebron, Durant, Kawhi, and Paul George at the forward which is another group with 2-3 players who will go down as some of the greatest to ever do it. There’s plenty of players I’m leaving out of those positions as-well, but the center position seems vacant when trying to fill it. I mean is Dwight the best option? The last end of dirks career ? It’s most realistically someone like Anthony Davis who doesn’t even like being considered a center, you have all these young talents at the big when for the last decade it’s been a weak position. Marc Gasol and Cousins are probably the best centers besides AD in my personal opinion for the 2010’s and that’s just so weak compared to the guards and forwards."
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
"Luka Dončić, Wardell Stephen Curry II and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the overrated trio. I’m going to keep saying it. I don’t care if it hurts your feelings.  Giannis Antetokounmpo isn’t a top 5 player in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Anthony Davis are better.  Wardell Stephen Curry II wasn’t the 2nd best player of the 2010s. Kyrie Irving is the best point guard in the NBA.   Luka Dončić isn’t a top 10 player in the NBA. Luka Dončić doesn’t have GOAT potential."
One Anthony Davis buzzer beater rims out and it's a whole different story.
"Yeah but it’s not like Lebron isn’t getting votes he’s just not winning. Like last year the bucks had 4 more wins than the lakers and giannis didn’t have an anthony Davis on the team. It’s pretty logical Giannis would win the mvp, my point was just that I get looking back and saying “wow how did he only win X mvps” but in each individual year it makes sense"
ur right. scroeder kuzma and anthony davis for bradley beal is a good trade

*Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
"Thanks for your response. I understand that a lot of NBA teams run set plays to create good shot opportunities, but from what I've seen that generally looks like ""Anthony Davis sets a screen for LeBron and they run a pick and roll two-man game while everyone else stands at the 3-point line to space out the defenders and be ready to catch and shoot.""  This looks a lot different, in my opinion, than most high school and college offenses where all five players are literally involved in the offensive motions whether through screening, passing, or potentially ending up with the shot. If NBA teams ran this offense, then we'd see a more even distribution of shot attempts throughout the starters. Of course, in real life this is not the case, as the superstars are almost always the ones with significantly more shot attempts than the rest of the squad.     And, just to be clear, I never said that a 5-man motion offense is \*better\* than having the best player take all the shots. I was simply noticing that this was not the case, hardly ever, in the NBA, and was opening up a discussion as to why that might be."
Isn’t it obvious? Most people are in their feelings. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship. LeBron James and Anthony Davis witnessed first hand  the monster Kevin Durant is in the playoffs.
Lebron has Anthony Davis to back him up this time vs super team Durant. Lakers in 6
"This was always very telling about his floor raising ability:   2015-19: Anthony Davis with no Jrue Holiday: 4180 min  -3.12 net rating 107.02 offensive rating.   Jrue Holiday no Anthony Davis 2929 min: -2.41 net rating 109.38 offensive rating   I know he did a good job in the playoffs at this when he was hitting way above his career norms on jumpers but [by and large the story with him in the minutes without LeBron have been largely much of the same](https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612747&amp;Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=2544,203076).   AD is a great player but any situation where he is cast as having no 1 offensive burden type responsibility likely isnt conducive to him being a serious MVP candidate."
I don't see the issue here. Anthony Davis is not an MVP caliber player
"I'm not sure what you're seeing, but it's pretty HD on my end. These are all HD pics straight from Getty Images: [https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/lebron-james-and-anthony-davis-of-the-los-angeles-lakers-news-photo/1206498391](https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/lebron-james-and-anthony-davis-of-the-los-angeles-lakers-news-photo/1206498391)"
Damn.  Imagine if Anthony Fucking Davis never wins an MVP because he played at the wrong place at the wrong time. I’m calling it that people in the future will underrate the shit out of him because of the lack of individual accomplishments
1- Kawhi 2- Embiid 3- LeBron 4- Durant 5- Jokic 6- Steph 7- Anthony Davis 8- Giannis 9- Paul Geroge 10- Doncic  my top 10 MVP list
"Most likely to be named all stars in the West:  LeBron James  Donovan Mitchell  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Luka Doncic   Damian Lillard   That leaves 2 spots. But there's heavy competition for those with guys like Morant, Booker, SGA, McCollum, Anthony Davis, Fox (just to name a few)"
"Look at the minutes. Anthony Davis didn’t play, Leviton played the entire game.   Looks like LBJ can’t even lead a first seed team against a non playoff contender. Sad....  And people compare him to Michael Jordan....."
"Lol. Because people have short term memory. AD is a franchise player. It’s just that he’s fine with being no 2 since he’s not jealous about other people’s accomplishments. If you look at his game on offense and on defense, he’s the prototype for the modern big.  He has no holes on offense and on defense unlike Harden, Giannis, or Curry who are also great in their own right. AD can both shoot and defend at a high level though unlike some of those guys.  Anthony Davis carried a crappy Pelicans team before until at least the 2nd round. When healthy, AD can compete with those guys and he’s clutch as well. Let’s not forget his game winner against the Nuggets in the playoffs last year and he even gave the Lakers the lead the other day against the Sixers in a close game."
Yeah. Casuals don’t remember he reached the 2nd round of the playoffs even when Demarcus Cousins got injured. They lost to GSW and to be honest no one expected them to be get beyond that powerhouse.  You thought Anthony Davis career started when he joined the Lakers? You didn’t bother thinking why LeBron wanted to partner with him out of all players to begin with?
Ummm did you mean to compare Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid?
Anthony Davis has been belittled since he joined the Lakers. He’s top notch on both offense and defense. He can score from the paint up to the 3 point line. The dude is essentially built for the modern style of play. Each team that plays against the Lakers worry that they have no one to matchup against AD. They’re either too short or too slow.
Anthony Davis loves it
"Anthony Davis for Beal straight up, who says no?"
This is just a glimpse of how the Lakers would be faring without Anthony Davis  Says quite a bit
He's just salty that the world is seeing how pedestrian he'd look without Anthony Davis
This is just a glimpse of how the Lakers would be faring without Anthony Davis  Says quite a bit
"If you're voting based on who deserves it and has been better so far, I don't see how Anthony Davis makes it as a starter but kawhi and/or PG don't"
I mean he's Anthony Davis... That's like saying Steph is shooting above league average from 3.
We counter offer one Kyle Kuzma and a bag of Anthony Davis chips
"That label is literally only a story made up by fans. Anthony Davis used it to get to LA, but we all knew he was going to LA months in advance. Boston has ***never*** attracted the top tier free agents like LA or New York can, making trades hasn't changed anything."
"Nets couldn’t guard me, Imagine Anthony Davis in the paint.   Easiest 30/20 of his life on 90/70/88 shooting"
His brother is Anthony Davis?
"&gt;Conceivable, sure. With any evidence to suggest it’s true in this case? No.  Only what we know about AD's mentality with the Pelicans the last few years which came from him, and Lebron's very own comments, which likely do have some degree of insight given he's a close teammate of him.  [“When you’re losing, you don’t realize that you’re not happy,” Davis said. “You made a ton of money. You can do whatever you want. You can live this lifestyle, quote-unquote ‘The American Dream,’ but losing sucks. I {realized that} I’m not happy. I want to be happy. And you kind of go through these times where it’s like, do I really want to play basketball? Am I really good enough? You start doubting yourself because you’re not happy. Or it might be stuff in your personal life where you’re not happy. Whether it’s in a relationship or family, whatever it may be. I had some of those things where it’s like I’m going through something off the court. I’m not happy and it’s reflecting my game. It starts leading to minor injuries, you’re not playing hard enough, things like that.”](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2021/1/25/22172505/anthony-davis-new-orleans-pelicans-goodbye-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-rich-paul-holiday-rondo)  As for my supposed ""questioning"" of his competitiveness, I'm not. It's the same mentality that nearly drove Kobe out of LA, that did drive Lebron out of Cleveland, KD  out of GS, etc... Their competitiveness inherently drives them to seek and achieve success at their craft, and toughing it out in NOLA just to not make the playoffs or barely scrape in to them and get swept isn't that.  Also, you still haven't acknowledged that whole ""I'm happy/not bitter thing."" You might as well be that happy/mad face meme right now."

"you forgot boogie but yeah might be recency bias but demarcus cousins, dwight howard, anthony davis frontcourt rotation would be crazy."
"Next gen bigs all goofing around with 3 ball because of Steph, and to a lesser extent, Anthony Davis."
Lillard??????????? Anthony Davis????????  Draymond Green???? Just because you can't score does mean you can't impact on other end
Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis.   He's got a few good years left, then he'll have an injury that he won't bounce back from.  He's good enough he'll remain in the league for awhile but he'll be a shell of his former self."
"So you just making things up now? Because that's blatantly not true.   Dame has literally been more efficient than KD in 3/4 playoffs since they started recording the stat. Dame has also been higher volume in 2/4 playoffs, and they were tied in one of the other ones   Dames regular season numbers are the same - higher volume and higher efficiency.   Besides, Jrue didn't clamp Dame in isolation lmao (also...KD is 6'10 lol. I would hope Jrue can't guard him). He was great in isolation. He just couldn't get anything in the PnR - and that was because of Anthony Davis, not Jrue   Dame scored 1.13 PPP in isolation that series against the Pelicans, whereas KD was at 1.01 PPP that playoffs."
"Taylor’s got a long history of valuing how a great player’s skill set meshes with other elite talent over how a great player can carry the load alone. It’s why he’s said for years that KG is underrated and why he is a big fan of Anthony Davis, both of whom were reliant on being paired with other talented offensive players to unlock their full potential on that end of the floor."
And Lebron James and Anthony Davis are better than KD
why are you comparing kyrie and harden to trez and dennis and not dennis and anthony davis lol. did you forget the lakers have anthony davis or something?
"Ah, unlike Lebron who just teamed up with Anthony Davis, and then added the 6MOTY and runner up. That happened naturally."
"Warrior fans, would you take Anthony Davis for Steph Curry? Straight up 1:1"
Anthony davis and Kuz are the same height? Man the difference in skill is wild
"&gt;Have you noticed any teams defend that particularly well?  You mean an actual screen the screener play or actual spain pick and roll not just a decoy? For an actual Spain P+R often you want both on ball defenders to switch to screw up the two screeners who are kind of like toggling together. Ive seen the Clippers blow it up before they have the personnel for it.   If you mean just the conventional pull up 3 out of pick and roll they were getting beat out of last night the center can come up higher. But the best remedy tbh is just see the screen coming and get over it, Eric Bledsoe in Milwaukee this was what he did better than anybody Milwaukee was very conservative with their drop also and it worked. There are definitely alot of plays Simmons gets over fine we only remember the ones he doesnt because they result in 3s but it can be an issue.   Embiid can come up higher a couple of his deep drops were kind of lazy and random March reg season type energy. But yeah he's never gonna come up high to the level of like what an Anthony Davis has shown"
"Calling anyone who has a first name as their last name by their last name sounds really weird      Ex. Chris Paul, Lebron james, kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard. The only exeptions to this are d’angelo Russell and Michael Jordan"
Tony Davis and Anthony Allen were briefly on the Pelicans together
Not like Lebron had Anthony Davis as his best defender while Giannis had Wesley Matthews as his best defender... you realize most of these stats are affected by team defensive stats
"First of all, back in '04-'05, Rashard and his wife used to shop at the grocery store I worked at in high school (Fairwood area of Kent). They are such amazingly nice people.  Anyway, I really think what you have with Gobert is what happens when any athletic 7 footer has the opportunity to prowl for defensive opportunities. If you put Jarrett Allen in his spot, or even Anthony Davis, would you get similar defensive results? (subpar 1 on 1 matchups against elite offensive bigs, and a brick wall against everyone under 7 feet). I think Rudy is a stat-grabber on defense. The defensive version of a guy who puts up 40 shots a game, instead of playing within an offense."
"I mean that's kind of the point though right? It's not a team full of polished ready to roll talen it's not a team that's got a Chris Paul or a Rudy gobert or a kawhi Leonard or an Anthony Davis sitting in the wings. It's not a team that can afford for him to have an off week or so because as you stated they don't currently have the firepower to blow guys out. It's a team that lives and dies by demar right now. I don't know if you've had a chance to watch them much this year. They're full of young up and coming players but The difference in offensive cohesion when he's on versus off is absolutely dramatic. He has become one of the most measured floor generals in the entire NBA. off the top of my head I can think of at least six of those 18 wins that demar single-handedly 100%, won for them. So just saying that those players are better than him I think is to do a disservice to how radically he has morphed his game the last couple of years. And again this is coming from someone that was one of his most vocal critics during those raptor runs. I used to throw a huge huge fit every time he would be named an All Star. The guy is damn good right now."
"&gt;Kawhi  Walked after one season in Toronto.   &gt;Butler  Has been on 3 teams since we were linked to him  &gt;Davis  A team of Jaylen Brown and Anthony Davis isn’t winning anything, and Davis was very open about not wanting to play for Boston. We’d have only Jaylen Brown now after Davis inevitably went to LA.  &gt;Harden  Again, is a team of Harden-Kemba-Tatum with a bunch of scrubs enough to beat LA or Brooklyn?"
"Ahh yes, a good game by &lt;put Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, or Luka Doncic here&gt; always brings out these questions and the Giannis haters such as /u/gunter_grass"
"Wow a measly 2 point drop one year and a .3 drop the other for a team known for its defense first. You’d expect the DPOY to do more then that, look what a guy like Anthony Davis did to our offense in a series. Look what he did against portland. He can come out and guard you outside and he’s a force on the inside too. Gobert simply isn’t that impactful"
"I can't really tell if the knee things is true, if it is, nothing to contest here.  However, if the contact is only that hand on the back, that's a fucking flop. He jumps like six inches off the ground, throws his legs out from under himself and gets a call. It's the center equivalent of guard head snapping. It's fake and a flop.  Also hand in the back being a foul is so inconsistently called that I can't even take it serious anymore. Anthony Davis does not defend or rebound without doing this and is *never* called for it."
"Buddy getting 3 points on a 2 point shot and it never being changed was crazy. The score was 121-120 before the last second foul.   It was literally the difference of a OT and a Loss. But oh well, no Gasol, no Anthony Davis, No Lebron James, no Caruso and Lakers still showed up. I loved the intensity and offense they had."
"Shockingly, Anthony Davis has a large impact on the amount of success the Lakers have  More at 10"
No but the one that includes Lebron James and Anthony Davis might
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
That you Anthony Davis?
"What’s not to understand about my team absolutely bending Gobert over all night in the paint? And not only tonight but also the last time we played them? When we didn’t even have Embiid, mind you....And the Pelicans the other night? Oh and how about whenever Jokic plays them? And Anthony Davis?   Throw these metrics at me all you want. I’m not doubting Gobert is a great defender. But I am doubting him being the best in the NBA. You simply can’t be if you let the top guys in the league just absolutely sodomize you."
So Anthony Davis isn’t a superstar?
"we are clearly a bad matchup for the pels  also, can zion be a 5? i don’t see why not besides jokic and embiid. anthony davis isn’t big enough"
Do you genuinely believe the duo of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is better than the duo of Lebron James and Anthony Davis? That Clippers team also had so many chemistry problems all season long and could never get it right.
*Pre-2020 Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
And no Anthony Davis
G Chris Paul 6'  G Steph Curry 6'3  F Michael Jordan 6'6  F Charles Barkley 6'5  C Anthony Davis 6'10
"Ig it just comes down to what we value more. I don’t regard Wiseman’s free throws to be a big drawback but ig it does for you. Now ur second point, I disagree with. A one on one matchup is much more significant than your teammates. If ur going up against Anthony Davis, it doesn’t really matter how good ur teammates are"
"Wiseman averages like 1 min more than IQ not a huge diff. Wiseman averages higher reb, blocks, fg %, and efficiency. Also wiseman started most of his minutes and was playing in the starting rotation against centers like Anthony Davis, Myles turner, etc. I can’t say IQ has been matched up against the same competition as he’s not exactly in the starting rotation"
"While I agree that the MVP has usually gone to the top 1-2 teams in the past 20 years and that Westbrook's MVP was an outlier when it came to his team's record, Westbrook was #1 in PER that season and the person who has been #1 in PER has been MVP the last 10 out of 12 seasons. Only Derrick Rose, in 2011, won MVP outside of the top 3 in PER (#9). Anthony Davis topped the league in PER but Steph Curry (#3) won MVP in 2015."
"LeBron wouldn't sign with Dolan in a salary cap because he needs a good team surrounded around him. With a $40 million LeBron contract, it takes managerial skills to build a team around him with a limited cap. But if Dolan can spend $400 million, he can put whoever he wants around LeBron by throwing money at other all-stars. Why would Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, and a great 3 point shooter like Joe Harris say, ""We'd rather not double our salaries and go play with LeBron. I'll take $30 million instead of $60 million and go to San Antonio."""
"Thats definitely fair. There's also things like NBA experience vs Age experience, etc that would prevent it from being perfect.       This range technically does catch Randle in his year with NOP where he would be third fiddle to Anthony Davis/Jrue Holiday. Definitely not exactly the same, but could help balance the comparison"
"Anthony Davis, jimmy butler, Charles Barkley just off the top of my head"
"The power to fire a coach of a franchise lies entirely on the owner. No player in the league has that power. Do they possess the power of influence? Perhaps, but that's a case by case basis. Josh Hart can't influence a coach to be fired as much as an Anthony Davis. But that's not because their judgement should be trusted more. It's because they ultimately feel that the star player asset brings in more money than the coaching asset."
I don't know man. I personally think the Lakers are better off playing games without Anthony Davis. Just one man's opinion.
&gt;The Lakers and Jeanie seem to care about being viewed as a model franchise about treating players right (the whole giving Kobe a huge contract after his injury).  And like trading all of your recent draft picks for Anthony Davis.
shout out to Anthony Davis' shirt
"People are forgetting about the ""Anthony Davis Defending"" part."
No. Anthony Davis is quite possibly the best lob catcher ever
Anthony Davis and Jason Kidd
"Trying to get a bit creative and including some other guys who play bigger than their size.   * CP3 is a good choice at 6'0 * Steph Curry at 6'3 - not that he plays bigger than his height, but just crazy valuable on offense * maybe add in D-Wade at 6'4 - can handle some bigger wings. * Charles Barkley at 6'6 (and I think he's actually even shorter). Will gobble boards. * Anthony Davis at 6'10 is a pretty good option. Rim protection ability plus perimeter skills.   That adds up to 31'11"", so an inch to spare.  Def some other changes that could be made to include either MJ or LeBron, like going with another 6 ft guard, or using Ben Wallace. I like mixing it up a bit though, and think this team would be very good. Also thought about including Elgin Baylor at 6'5, or Wes Unseld at 6'7. If you trade Unseld for AD, you can swap out Wade for LeBron (or MJ). I do like AD opening up the floor for Barkley and Wade though. You also get some flexibility if you knock an inch or two off Barkley's height, as seems to be the actual case."
"Ben Simmons or Anthony Davis. It seems crazy because both are allstars and All NBA calibre players but they could do SO much more.  With Simmons, his lack of aggression on offence is frustrating. Never mind his 3 point shot, if he just ran like Lebron or Giannis and attacked the rim he could get so much more points.   With AD, on the offensive end, he has games where he plays really bad but because of his size and amount of fouls he gets, he can still get his points total up.  Both do have amazing defence though. No complaints on that end."
2017 - Anthony Davis (stubbed his toe on one of the benches in the locker room)
"True, like the Lakers signing Anthony Davis this offseason. It's really just about whether a team goes into the offseason as a team that's under the cap or not, which the Lakers did not because of AD's cap hold. If you start off under the cap, it's nearly impossible to then go into the tax. You'd presumably have to trade a bunch of your players midseason each for guys making 125% of their salary and then have all those new contracts add up to exceed the luxury tax."
"He’s number 4 in the NBA’s DPOY race and this is their explanation  &gt;”The Lakers still boast the league’s top defensive rating (105.1), with Anthony Davis sidelined since Valentine’s Day, and rank in the Top 5 in blocks, defensive rebounds, opponents’ field-goal percentage, opponents’ free throw attempts and opponents’ effective field-goal percentage. James leads the NBA in defensive win shares (0.178) and ranks fourth in defensive rating (102.6), with a 9.2 net rating”  I also remember him holding his opponents to a ridiculously low field goal percentage but I forgot how to get that statistic. Obviously I‘ve got some bias but LeBron has actually been really good this year."
I like to think what could have been with the young lakers team. Julius Randle and Ingram are looking awesome. I would of course take Lebron and Anthony Davis but they had a ton of pieces. Now I’m looking at the baby bulls and wondering if they can be something down the road. I don’t know if Lavine will be patient enough to stick around but it feels like teams aren’t given time to grow. Coaches are randomly fired and players traded or given up on and it just seems so many teams are constantly tearing it down then hoping to get lucky with a quick rebuild.
"Bruh, I'm not gonna be making any cases for LeBron this year, especially since I got my own dog in this fight, but Jesus Christ, are you seriously putting Jrue Holiday and goddamn Anthony Davis in the same sentence here?  Like I'm trying to come up with a comparison to put it into perspective how hilariously dumb this take is, but I legit can't."
Too bias towards lebron is unreal. They were comparing the help giannis got in khris Middleton to Anthony fucking Davis Hahaha.

"This line of thinking is borderline insane. Acting like acquiring Anthony Davis has resulted in some sort of hindrance for them. They're literally fresh off a championship. You can't control injuries, especially unexpected ones like AD's   And Schroder isn't even injury prone, he's been out for health and safety protocols"
"You’re embarrassing yourself, please stop.   Anthony Davis has never had issues regarding his health that are self inflicted besides his early shoulder injuries that he focused on and they figured it out.    He has a team of nutritionists and physical trainers who 100% know more about his body and how to deal with it more than you."
Anthony Davis was replaced by Devin Booker
&gt; Giannis also did all of that without having a player of the caliber of Anthony Davis to take away attention from him and playing the lowest amount of minutes of an MVP ever.   &amp;#x200B;  1. Khris Middleton had a historically efficient season. 2. Is him playing the lowest amount of minutes a reflection of him or his supporting cast?
"It's the same thing as Lebron really. Anthony Davis is injured, hence the Lakers lose a bunch of games, and Lebron suddenly goes down the list.  Now he shouldn't have been on top in the first place but it seems dumb."
"Anthony Davis got traded to the Lakers and instantly won a championship, get over it"
"Yet somehow people find a way to throw him into MVP discussions in years were there is no debate OR he doesn't deserve it, i.e 2018, 2020 and 2021.  Kawhi Leonard averages more points, steals, blocks, shoots a better percentage from the field, 3-PT and FT, has a higher PER and WS/48 while winning more games, but he is 6th while LeBron is 2nd.  Nikola Jokic averages more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, has a higher FG%, 3-PT% and FT%, but he is 3rd while LeBron is 2nd.  LeBron shouldn't even be Top 5 in MVP voting so far yet people are trying to put him into a two way race with Embiid. Last year he should've gotten zero votes when compared to Giannis's record breaking season, but his stans still found a way to put him there.  Embiid, Kawhi, Jokic, Giannis and Steph/Dame should be the Top 5, but let's put LeBron at 2nd when he is 5-5 without Anthony Davis in the starting lineup while putting worse stats than all of them."
"Agree with this. Dinwiddie is a better player in a vacuum but Tucker is the type of player this team needs. We don’t need another shot creator, we need someone who can defend Anthony Davis or LeBron in the finals and knock down an open 3. There aren’t too many guys that fit that description that we could reasonably get for injured Spencer and a 2nd."

"Kentucky  PG: Jamal Murray, De’Aaron Fox, John Wall  SG: SGA, Tyler Herro, Malik Monk  SF: Devin Booker and Keldon Johnson  PF: Anthony Davis and Julius Randle  C: Towns, Bam Adebayo, Enes Kanter  There’s also Eric Bledsoe, Nerlens Noel and DeMarcus Cousins if he can get back to at least a portion of what he was."
"That’s the problem with the lakers, they are putting all their eggs in one basket betting on Anthony Davis to stay healthy. AD had a 4 month hiatus and still admittedly played injured in the finals, it’s always the healthiest teams that come out on top"
"&gt; I'm arguin that it's a small sample size  It's a sample size of him being in two playoffs so far, facing HoF level talent and being the best player in every series except the one having Anthony Davis and Lebron James."
"I was hoping you would’ve thought this through a little more.   By that logic, every player on a poor offensive team/lineup isn’t having a positive impact. If you are comparing him to the Wizards without him specifically ...  Then the Sixers are better without Ben Simmons on defense. Thus, by your logic, he is not having a positive impact defensively on the Sixers ... what they are with him is irrelevant if it’s lower than what they are without him.   Same with Anthony Davis.   The Thunder have a 116 DRTG, which would be one of the worst in the league, when Lu Dort is on the court.  ... do you get it now?"
Confirmed - Anthony Davis is a liar.
"Yeah but he can’t really guard wings. There’s a huge size difference between him and lot of the SFs in the league. DFS has pretty much been the best at defending any position outside of the 5 for our team. Even if Richardson was doing better on offense, I think he would have been a little bit of a letdown because he really doesn’t move the needle enough defensively  Every Western Conference Playoff Team has 1 truly elite defender besides us pretty much. Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Rudy Gobert, Mikal Bridges, Robert Covington, Draymond Green, Dejounte Murray.  I’m not sure if Gary Harris has been elite, so maybe Denver also, but I know He’s been a lockdown defender in past season."
Isiah Thomas - Ray Allen - MJ - Draymond - Anthony Davis  I think that'd be a fun line-up to see.
"Have his center pickups been in line with the league as a whole? Maybe. I haven't done that research, but maybe. I should look into that.  But look at the guys you face in the playoffs. Bam is only 6' 9"", but he's *good*. I mean, he's fucking *good*.  Look at Embiid. Some of us give him shit from time to time, but he's *awesome*, and he's a legit 7'.  Look at Anthony Davis. I mean, you get the idea.  Maybe the *majority* of NBA teams have the type of centers that Ainge has been getting. But the teams that are in the playoffs? The teams that are playing and winning finals? They *don't* have Ainge-type centers. They have guys who are either significantly better (Bam), or significantly larger... *and* better (Embiid, Davis, Jokić, etc.)  Ainge shouldn't be using the rest of the league as a benchmark -- he should be using the very top teams, the legit title contenders, as a benchmark. *Those* are the types of players he should be acquiring, and those are the types of teams he should be building."
"Reminds me of all the times Anthony Davis took New Orleans to the playoffs, or Melo with the Knicks, so many examples"
"Adams is there to protect Zion on the defensive end and limit wear and tear. It's not the first time the Pelicans have done this. Look at pictures of Anthony Davis as a rookie and come to the conclusion that he was capable of being an every possession 5 on the defensive end.                 That was a big reason why things went sideways in New Orleans. Demps kept trying to find solutions to the problem, and when he thought he finally found one in Boogie, Cousins tore his Achilles."
"I've posted this in other threads but my fantasy woes continue....  Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson along with random absences like Bertans, Herro, and Hayward."
"Terrible decision fam, all us Lakers fans were saying we should rest Lebron anyway. No way we were beating this Jazz team without Schroeder let alone Anthony Davis."
"Danny ainge in general hasn't been good for the last 5 years, but I don't think it's because he's drafted poorly.   His problem was that he sat on all his assets year after year after year only to see them depreciate in value every year.  People don't understand that a proven player &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a pick in 99% of scenarios. Unless theres a LeBron, anthony davis, zion kinda guy out there and you have the #1 pick, you take the all star   It's like buying a car - the moment you take it off the lot (draft the player) it becomes dramatically less valuable"
Carmelo Anthony Davis Bertans would like a word
Not as good as Marquese Chris Paul George Karl Anthony Davis Bertans
They’re both role players. Rudy’s role will be spectator once they put Anthony Davis at center
"What is his case?   * Worst WS/48 since his rookie season, which is one of the few all-in-one advanced stats people follow. Anthony Davis ranks 14 slots higher and Jokic/Embiid/Kawhi make up the top three.   * Outside the top 10 in scoring, hanging on to top 10 assists by 0.1APG.  * Dropped 4 games in a row without AD.   * Plays on a stacked team coming off a championship, which means even more to live up to.  Obviously it isn't a literal ""laws of physics don't allow this"" impossibility, but I don't see a realistic path that doesn't involve a bunch of other players all having season-ending injuries or hemorrhaging wins. ""He's declined less than he should have"" isn't an MVP campaign, even if it's impressive as hell."
&gt; Anthony Davis who historically has been better than Paul George  This is the main flawed point. AD has been disappointing to say the least throughout the whole season. In the start of the season PG was getting MVP talks.
Dude Harden scored more than the rest of the Rox starters combined in the elimination game against the Lakers and people still talked about him choking.  More than four other NBA starters COMBINED. The fuck else do you want him to do? Block Anthony Davis? Save your failing marriage? Like damn.
"Yeah, these people are actually INSANE if they think that LeBron James would be playing the same way if this was a playoff game. It could be Rudy Gobert, Dikembe Mutombo, Hakeem Olajuwon, you name it, LeBron would be driving and getting points if this was a playoff game.  Also Rudy is really good, might win DPOY this year again, but we've seen Anthony Davis absolutely ABUSE him on defense just this past year, so it's kinda weird to talk about how he should be DPOY after last night's game when he didn't even go against the guy that has routinely obliterated him everytime they face off.  The Jazz are cute, their fans will downvote me to oblivion, but we all know that their season ends in the 2nd round the same way it happened to the 2018 Raptors and the 2020 Bucks. The Jazz could win 60 of their 72 games and there are zero people outside of Utah that would pick them to beat the Clippers, Lakers and the Nets/Sixers in consecutive playoff series."
"They’re still one of the better teams defensively but they’re lacking in 3 point scoring and offense. Beal is the type of superstar they need. Schroeder/Beal/Kuz/LBJ/Gasol/Caruso/KCP/THT/Harrell is an NBA Finals team over a hobbled Anthony Davis. They’re not gonna make it out the west with AD coming back not 100%. Even if he does come back their shooting wouldn’t be enough to beat the top teams. can’t honestly tell me AD can defend and produce at a high level with an achilles injury, he’d get torched or reinjured. BKN has their number should they reach the finals with hobbled AD."
Just putting this here:  Steven Adams makes more the Anthony Davis
"The 2020 Lakers was a way better defensive team then the 2018 Cavs. Shot blocking from AD, Mcgee and D12. Can go big or small. Playoff Rondo showed up. And the Lakers had Anthony Davis in 2020. 2018 Cavs had alot of shooting so Bron was able to play 5 out. The east teams he played were young or overrated(Toronto). Denver and Portland were better then the Pacers, Celtics and Raptors."
"Holy fuck these nerds think Mike fucking Conley is as impactful as Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid because a stat told them to.  Joel Embiid is an MVP candidate carrying his team to first in the East and somehow Mike Conley is on par with him? What reaction do you think you would garner from say, the NBA on TNT crew if you said that Mike Conley is ""as impactful"" as that list becuase RAPTOR said so."
"&gt;Except Kawhi can't leave to team up with a Kyrie Irving-level player and have one of the deepest teams in the league. Once again he'd be signing with a team that's not that good like Chicago or New York. If he wants to go to an already established contender that can't get him otherwise (Bucks, Warriors, 76ers, Jazz) it's gonna cost them. If this situation were to play out it'd be similar to the Anthony Davis situation with New Orleans. It would take 3 young guys (or 2 + 1 star), a guaranteed top 10 pick, and more picks on top of that especially since sign-and-trades can only be for 3+ years and look what they got for Davis with only 1 year left on his.  Except he literally can do that with the Warriors  &gt;It would be a bidding war. Miami and Philadelphia both fumbled the bag with Harden so they'd be in the race. The 76ers would offer Simmons + Maxey, the Heat would offer 3 of Bam, Herro, and/or Robinson, the Celtics would offer Brown and their young guys, the Raptors would call and offer Siakam, the Nuggets would offer Murray, the Suns would offer Ayton, the Pelicans would offer Ingram, the Jazz would offer the Hawks would offer Collins and Hunter, hell... Even the Nets would probably see if they could get him for Kyrie. I think I'd take all of those offers (with appropriate picks attached of course) before taking Wiggins.  It wouldn’t be a bidding war since it’s literally a sign and trade. Do you understand how sign and trades work?   &gt;This discussion is asinine anyway since Leonard isn't gonna be requesting a trade. The Western Conference is weaker than its ever been with the ""dark horse"" being a team that made no significant changes and got bounced in the 1st round last season. This year should be the year we get Clippers/Lakers in the WCF and the healthier of the two teams will triumph.  Again, he wouldn’t be requesting a trade. He would be leaving in *free agency* through a sign and trade.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal) is the definition since you clearly don’t know what it means.  But yeah you’re clearly a biased Clippers fan so I guess I’m wasting my time."

"Anthony Davis in 19-20 vs Utah (3Matchups)   29.7/8.3 on 63.9 TS  I understand your PG and Kawhi point but since pairing with LeBron,Davis is a bigger issue for Utah than any player on the Clippers.   So unless you are assuming Davis to be unhealthy, the Clippers are the better matchup."
"It's a combination of reasons, that all combined because people don't think for themselves, and rely on overarching stories to tell them how to react to players that aren't on their preferred team  1. He was really out of shape. He had a lot of trouble getting up and down the court. It was more fun to call him fat than to realize ""Hey this dude is clearly out of shape and still putting up nearly 20 pts a game."" Now, he's in shape, but his insane athleticism doesn't present itself in the ways you would expect. I feel like ""athleticism"" paints a picture in people's minds of LeBron's chase down block, and (while he does have that ability as well) people tend to ignore a lot of other manifestations. The thing that is most impressive to me about Zion is how he'll be at the top of the key, and then basically just teleport to under the basket. His first step is so devastatingly fast, it's actually hard to notice, which is how he ends up being so efficient.  2. He has a weird gait. He doesn't seem to run like a NBA player runs, so people revert back to 1. I noticed even at the beginning of this season when he was supposedly in good shape, people immediately questioned it because he still had that weird waddle.   3. The Pelicans were being overly cautious with his health. The same exact way it happened with Anthony Davis, he started to develop a reputation of being ""always hurt"" when in reality the team just didn't want to risk their brand new shiny rookie. Because people don't pay attention to a small market team that's losing a lot, they mostly just start talking about if he's a bust and making Greg Oden comparisons.  4. He does all his scoring in the paint. While he is a monstrous dunker, the lasting effect is that he has a game that's actually not all that exciting. Outside of the crazy dunks (I think there were 5 tonight), he mostly scores off inside layups. Next to the free throw, this is probably the least exciting way to score in the NBA -- especially in 2021. So people have this perception of him being this super exciting player, and then they turn on the game and see 10 inside layups and feel gypped."
"This just shows that LeBron can't do anything without Anthony Davis. If he gets seriously injured (god forbid), his chip chances go down the toilet."
&gt;**Lebron James has a 38-35 record as a Laker in games Anthony Davis doesn't play**  So LeBron has a 52% win percentage without his #2.  Michael Jordan had a 193–187 record without Pippen. A 50.7% win percentage. What a hack.
"Without Anthony Davis, is LeBron James just an Akron Andrew Wiggins?"
"Here’s the article if you don’t believe AD hasn’t been healthy all year , this is in December , literally when regular season started . https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2020-12-27/lakers-anthony-davis-out-against-timberwolves%3f_amp=true"
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"I know for a fact that isn’t true.  If you play at an MVP level, which harden has for the past 6 years, it doesn’t matter if you want to be traded or if your a bad locker room presence or both.    There are numerous times this has happened. Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell, anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Alonzo morning... etc."
"Star power, their two best players are not top 10 players like Anthony Davis and Lebron James."
"Based on last playoffs Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell are the best guards since Michael Jordan, Jimmy Butler is on LeBron's level and Anthony Davis is the best mid range shooter in the history of the league by a wide margin. I think we can safely say none of those are true and the bubble inflated offensive performance."
I genuinely blanked on AD the other day. I heard Kostas was 3rd person in player vote for All-Stars and I asked who made number 2. lol. I'd forgotten Anthony Davis was a thing.  So I feel you BI.
People don't want to admit it but rings and how much you played in the playoffs affect our judgement way too much. Kg played on terrible wolves teams for most of his prime and ended up only winning 1 ring. When you really look at their game Tim Duncan wasn't really much better but because he won consistently people are a lot more open to the fact that he is a top 10 player. Its why I don't blame players for forcing themselves out of terrible situations. If Anthony Davis hadn't left the pelicans he would have rotted out as a fringe top 50 player when he has the talent of a top 30 player.
Anthony davis and you'll outscore every team by 20 lmao.
Anthony davis???
"Kyrie had the best games of his life and they still had to come back from down 3-1. For AD to replicate that it would take the same from him which can’t just be expected. The drop off from the crazy Kyrie to Mo Williams is much bigger then the drop off from Anthony Davis to Tristan Thompson.  I know you are a Lakers fan and simple facts don’t process well, but it is completely reasonable to say the Warriors could win in 5. They doesn’t make someone a troll."
Anthony Davis literally hit a game winner in the same spot versus the Nuggets...  And he hit a dagger 3 versus Miami in the Finals too.
"how are so many people saying GSW win and LA win, this is anthony davis we talking about man, Cavs win and LA loses"
"Pre knee-operation Timmy was closer to Anthony Davis levels of athleticism than people realize (it isn’t a perfect comparison and AD has better handles, but still)."

Ok but that team had the goat and also Anthony Davis.
the nets will definitely struggle if they don’t sign the joker and someone like Anthony Davis. Need more ⭐️ power.

"Thats funny, because I think that Anthony Davis is the best ""center"" in the game and deserves another first team selection.  Disregard the fact that he isn't the best center, or even a center at all."
Dude reminds me a lot of prime joakim noah but mans turned down a max contract thinking he was Anthony Davis smh
"You're right, whether it's PF or C, there's always been skilled and great bigs playing--it's just that the positions have really evolved throughout the years. This is nephew-level take from OP. The back-to-back MVP is a big who is fast and skilled like a wing, and has playmaking abilities. In 2017-18: Anthony Davis was third, Giannis sixth, and Durant seventh in votes. In 2013-14, Joakim Noah was fourth in votes. In 2012-13, Tim Duncan was seventh in votes. In 2011-12, Kevin Love was sixth and Dwight Howard seventh in votes. In 2010-11, Dwight Howard was second and Dirk sixth in votes.  OP is romanticizing this too much. It was only eight years removed when Noah was a point-center in the MVP discussion, just not as good as Jokic. A lot of bigs have adapted a perimeter game and some play like a wing (or are wings but are tall like centers). Either way, the ""bigs"" are not likely to go away; they'll just keep adapting and evolving."
Did you just say Jimmy Butler is better than Anthony Davis?
Anthony Davis . Last year playoffs I’ve never seen someone just automatic like that . He couldn’t miss from mid range . He was just calling it It was a two man offense .There is no solution for a healthy Ad
"Didn’t someone in his family say if he’s not a lottery pick there’s a high chance he stays   I really hope he stays, dude plays like an Anthony Davis lite"
"Just prior to lebrons injury:  &gt;	Big man Anthony Davis has been out a month now, yet there the Lakers sit atop the league in defensive efficiency (106.0), a sizable edge over Philadelphia (108) and Utah (108.3). And there’s James, leading all players in defensive win shares (0.183) by an equally impressive margin. The 36-year-old future Hall of Famer has a defensive field goal percentage of 40.6% compared to the 46% they normally shoot. That 5.4% difference ranks seventh among players who have logged at least 30 games and face 9.5 shots or more per game. And that makes James the top-ranked non-center. *NBA.com*  LeBron also ranks 6th in defensive win shares, where as Jokic ranks 151st."

I'm not even debating your completely incorrect points about Ben. My point is we don't need four of these posts every damn day for a dude who isn't even a superstar.   He has more posts than Dame Lillard. More than Anthony Davis. More than other young players with holes in their game who haven't accomplished near what he has. Can everyone just hop off of his dick?
I thought he sounded more like Anthony Davis
Maybe. An occasional package with a Schroeder&gt;LeBron might make the offense more versatile though. It's all probably a moot point though when Anthony Davis comes back though.
April 17th vs UTA for Anthony Davis. Either April 30th vs SAC or May 2nd vs TOR for LeBron James.
Anthony davis signed with klutch while he was on the pelicans and months later forced his way to the lakers. how is that not remembered?
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.

Eh that might be true but based on the stats the Pelicans weren’t better with him on the floor defensively during his rookie season.  Also you need to factor in that Wiseman had far less college games than Davis and the NBA is a harder league to defend for traditional bigs than when Davis was a rookie back in 2012.  I almost guarantee you if you swapped Wiseman for rookie Davis that it would look pretty similar.    More likely than not that Wiseman doesn’t reach Anthony Davis level but honestly their rookie seasons are not that different considering the circumstances.
"In a 5 game series he averaged 4.6 fouls per game.   That’s a absurd foul per game for your best player, For reference Anthony Davis who was guarding everyone and the most active defender for Lakers averaged 3.2 fouls per game.  Jokic was nearly fouling out nearly every game"
Nephew Steph would be joining prime Anthony Davis who is a generational player
"imagine thinking this is how Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Markieff Morris, Montrez Harrell, and Anthony davis feel lmao    “oh poor lebron, please don’t make me perform on the highest level! i’ve only dedicated my entire life to this moment!”   what Rondo is talking about is how LeBron pouting and throwing his arms up in the air is condescending and doesn’t elevate the team and that makes the guys more scared to play    it’s not because the passes are literally so perfect they whisper “forgive me senpai” after every miss   there’s one thing to display negative body language to undermine confidence, but throwing perfect passes is just lunacy"
"uh, there is a team with lebron james and anthony davis on it"
I think Embiid is more vulnerable in the playoffs. He can’t play drop coverage against kyrie and harden for example. I’d rather have Anthony Davis. Also the sixers have probably the weakest defenders that they play big minutes to between the two teams. If the sixers don’t play curry or kormaz they’re gonna be very dry on shooting. If they do curry and Korkmaz will be attacked over and over.   I’d take the Lakers over the sixers defense easily in the playoffs
"I have no doubt that Bron will be fully healthy for the playoffs since it's a high ankle sprain ailing him, but I'm still skeptical on how available Anthony Davis might be. Tendinosis is no joke and is chronic compared to tendonitis. It's an injury that could easily be reaggravated"
Why would they set their sights on Anthony Davis?
"&gt;done so kneecapped the Pelican's leverage but they still got an amazing package for him so it gets overlooked  They got the best return ever for renting out one player for one season.  Definitely in basketball history, and maybe in all of sport.  So yeah, I'd say their leverage was intact.  Davis also had an ever-changing list of preferred destinations, so it's not quite correct to say he was set on the Lakers.  You also had Davis' agent making it crystal clear to anyone who would listen that trading for Davis was a 1-year rental, and no more.     &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   &gt;   &gt;“Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.”   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors)"
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
Keep it and develop Wiseman as fast as possible and set their sights on Anthony Davis.   Post Lebron Lakers isn’t that far off and I don’t see any reason why AD would want to stick around and waste his prime playing for what will almost certainly be a lottery bound team.
Anthony Davis?
"The 2018 rockets are massively better then the 2020 rockets, doesn't help that Russ was injured and had covid before the playoffs, and his injury lingered till like 5 weeks into this season  The Laker supporting cast in 2020 and Cavaliers supporting cast in 2018 are completely fucking different Jesus christ, they dismantled them because they all started going off, playoff Rondo came up, that team was leagues better defensively, and let's not forget about ahhhh shit what's his name, right *Anthony Davis*  LeBron had no chance in 2018, and I'm saying this as a die hard fan, Demigod or not it's a team game and if your team sucks, you won't win, the only players who ever won through a massive carry job are Hakeem and to some extent Dirk (his squad was actually decent) and those teams they beat are not the 2017-18 Warriors"
"Also wiseman’s rookie numbers aren’t far off from what anthony davis or cousins were doing(the two best rookies from that group) especially given that he’s playing 7 fewer mpg than either of them. Per 36 he’s scoring more than either of them, picking up one less board per game and doing it on much better efficiency than boogie was and a slightly lower fg% but higher efg than rookie AD"
"Anthony Davis. I thought he was still on the Lakers this year, but I sure haven't seen him on the court this year. Maybe he finally shaved between his eyebrows, so I don't recognize him."
And the 6ers before that. He played with Anthony Davis almost his whole tenure in NO and he drew plenty of attention New Orleans way. He is a really good b-level guy but arguing he’s top ten is a stretch
Im starting a discussion about Anthony Davis
"Yup, Anthony Davis is Michael Jordan because of 30 total playoff games played over the span of 5 years, 21 of which came last season LMFAO"
"I think that was definitely part of it.   Point is teams with scoring bigs w/range caused problems for Utah defensively. Not because Gobert can't defend them, but bcz it forces Gobert to focus of a single defender-- rather than being able to roam the paint &amp; keep everyone else from getting buckets at the rim.   That is why they needed a 2nd quality defensive big to be able to A) back-up Rudy effectively &amp; B) play mins next to him to defend quality opposing 5's when necessary (like Jokic &amp; AD)  But reports were that it was primarily Utah's problems w/Davis &amp; the Lakers last year, that led to Utah targeting Favors.  [Source](https://lakersdaily.com/report-utah-jazz-decided-to-target-derrick-favors-after-having-problems-with-anthony-davis/)"
"Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Steven Adams"
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol
"Man... how does this dude not get more calls.   People say it was hard to officiate Shaq, and Shaq always complains that he never got enough calls, but Shaq always got away with a lot of offensive fouls, and he averaged nearly double-digits free throws on his career.   Joker has never even averaged 5 a game.   If his name was Anthony Davis, he'd be shooting 15 free throws a game."
"&gt;Really? Do you know the value of a ring?  Yes really.  And yes, I do.  &gt;Like half of the teams in the nba dont have a ring.  And the Lakers are not one of those teams.  In fact, they have 17, and reliably win every four years, on average.  &gt;And those assets aint gonna help us when lebron needed help now  a) how much is Davis helping lately?  b) what if Davis had walked for nothing in December?  c) Ingram, Hart, Ball, Hunter, Wagner, Zubac, and Bonga all would precisely help now, and so could the future picks they wasted on renting Davis. d) with that depth, they would likely be the defending champs and not be hoping to make the play-ins.  &gt;Anthony fucking davis was anchoring that teams defense last year while hitting midrange like it was nothing. Laker fans are happy with the trade and it was all worth it  a) I'm sure I have been a Laker fan longer than you and b) it was still a bad trade, and far too much to rent one oft-injured player for one season and c) as I originally said, gutting their team and assets has left them in current ugly situation, as described above."
Anthony Davis always has some fresh Kobe’s on and I really like the leg sleeves + undershirt look
Turns out anthony davis is also pretty useful when hes healthy. Wild stuff
"&gt; But why would anybody expect that Schroder would lead a team to the play-offs as the number one option.   And, to your point, Anthony Davis couldn't reliably make the playoffs, either -- and with substantially more help than Schroder currently has."
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
"Fucking Anthony Carter  not knowing how to inbound the ball. We would have beaten magic in the finals easy and melo will be viewed so much different. Also, Anthony Davis game winner in g2 broke my heart"
"The Lakers are in largely the same situation, except they blew their assets on overpaying to rent Anthony Davis for one season.  It was that bad trade that put the Lakers over this barrel."
"Alright, first off, I'm never gonna be ""offended"" by good arguments in serious conversation. The highlight you posted is a great example of why Davis w/the Lakers was such a problem for Utah.  He's an incredible player. There is no debating that! But watching these highlights, I didn't see Gobert getting ""cooked"", I saw a generational talent hitting contested midrange jumpers, acrobatic &amp; well-defended shots at the rim, &amp; open threes.   That's what Anthony Davis does, because he's Anthony Davis.   My point is, by bringing in Favors, Utah now has the option of defending Davis with another quality defensive big BESIDES Gobert, so that Gobert doesn't have to abandon protecting the paint to try &amp; slow down a superstar offensive Big all night like AD.  It's not so much about stopping AD, its more about containing him without losing Gobert's paint presence to slow down the rest of the offense from feasting at the rim.  Superstars are gonna ""superstar"". You win in the playoffs by not letting role players beat you by taking away your advantages/strengths.  LA can be beat w/Lebron &amp; AD combining for 60-70 pts as long as guys like Kuzma, Caruso &amp; Gasol arent free to get whatever they want due to defenses being forced to abandon their scheme in order to contain the biggest threats."
"Welcome to the Nets, Anthony Davis"
Ok then so then why were they disagreeing with me. I said Anthony Davis specifically not the Lakers as a whole. I said AD does well against Gobert.  Then they mentioned the fact that Gobert is a system and not a 1 on 1 defender. So therefore its not Goberts fault.   So then I said either way AD still scores even against that system.  Just like you agreed rn that AD will give Gobert buckets. They disagreed on that front and pointed out the system. Howveer AD scores even against the system
I think this is a little bit of an exaggeration and while there is truth to it. You are taking away all blame from Gobert in order to defend hin. Gobert still gets cooked by Anthony Davis.   https://youtu.be/Nfr3nlxSaG8  Here's Anthony Davis giving Gobert a 40 piece. As you can see it's a little bit of Gobert over helping to keep the paint safe giving AD easy matchups. But its also AD going 1 on 1 with Gobert.
I really don't think that matters to LeBron James and Anthony Davis lmao
"He should not be on the basketball floor if Jokic is also on the floor. Doesn’t matter what way he was utilized, he should’ve never saw the floor with Jokic. He might this year cus of the personnel on the Lakers but it you need LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the floor with you to finally make you playable in the playoffs then it isn’t that great of an accomplishment lol."
“Forgiving” like you hadn’t previously drafted CP3 and Anthony Davis
Having to settle for Michael Kidd Gilchrist instead of Anthony Davis after the worst season in NBA history
"As a very casual NBA fan I was confusing him with Anthony Davis and thinking ""yeah I give him shit, he has millions of dollars and CHOOSES a unibrow. He's literally asking for it"" but no give this guy a break"
Anthony Davis lol
"Sabonis and Towns were born in the United States. There’s also Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Christian Wood, Dwight Howard, and Robert Williams."
Anthony Davis?  Does he not count?
Not sure what planet people are on but Anthony Davis is a big dude.
"You do realize that it was always Jrue and Anthony Davis,right?Now it’s Jrue and Giannis"
"2012 - Anthony Davis  2014 - Nikola Jokic  2015 - KAT  2017- Tatum , then Bam, THEN Mitchell"
Anthony Davis?
"Basketball is now an international game and there are more athletic bigs born outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.  The NBA now has a vast network of international scouts looking for athletic bigs.  Colleges and even some high schools look for international bigs as well, offering them an opportunity to get ready for the NBA.  Meanwhile American players who would have been bigs in an earlier era would rather be power forwards and even small forwards.  Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant could have been centers but prefer to play as forwards.  One exception you forgot to mention is Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo, who sounds foreign but was born in New Jersey."
"&gt;  He's statistically a perfectly average rim protector. Nothing more.  He's not being asked to be.  That's what Anthony Davis is for.  Drummond is a wide body who will clog up the key and take the physical beating that Anthony Davis is desperately trying to avoid at center.  &gt;  He's also statistically an overrated rebounder. He grabs a lot but his teams don't rebound better with him on the court. Meaning he's mostly just gobbling up rebounds that teammates could have gotten anyway, and rebounding his own misses on offense.  While what you're saying is partially true here, it lacks context.  Drummond is an all time rebounder, and you really, really need to be pushing a slant otherwise.  Here's the context it's missing:  bench squads miss more shots.  There are more rebounds per 100 possessions to be had when bench squads are in.  So when Drummond goes out, Detroit's bench (which has actually had pretty solid rebounders over the years, if not really solid all around players) does a pretty decent job getting a similar number of rebounds per 100, but they actually don't rebound a better percentage.  &gt;  He's not useful catching lobs, he's statistically one of the worst finishers at the rim among centers.  These are two entirely different skill sets.  If you think LeBron James isn't going to have a laughably easy time throwing lobs to Drummond, you haven't watched either of them.  He's made some pretty mediocre centers into lob threats over the years, and while Drummond is poorly adapted to the modern NBA as a star, he's actually pretty well suited as a role player.  &gt;  He's useful enough setting screens, but that doesn't provide nearly enough value to offset what he costs your spacing and defense.  Oh he's definitely a net negative in terms of spacing.  But you have a stretch 4 who can offset some of this, and it's not like Dwight Howard or Javale McGee were providing any spacing in a similar role.  They both played excellent in their role for the Lakers, why not Drummond?  &gt;  The only aspect of Drummond's game that's actually valuable is his passing, both outlets in transition and post-passing.  Eh, he's a decent passer for a big and I've defended this before, but I'd just as soon have the ball in someone else's hands as much as possible in the starting lineup, and in Kuzma/Gasol's hands off the bench.  This is of course assuming they don't have Marc Gasol in the light minutes starting role with Drummond doing the Dwight thing of coming off the bench but playing heavy minutes (matchup dependent of course).  &gt;  Giving him post touches doesn't mean making him iso for a bucket. It means getting him the ball there and letting him make decisions.  If you're talking about high post, there is no coach in the NBA that would rather have Drummond get the ball in the high post that Gasol.  If you're talking about the low post, his decision making is problematic.  He does not have a polished post game or good foot work and is not very efficient this way.  He is at his best offensively when he's catching lobs after setting a screen, and when he's getting offensive rebounds for put backs.  You give him the ball in the low post, he's not so much making a decision, unless he makes a huge change from the last few years, he's just going to dive bomb the basket.  He passes pretty well out of the high post, not the low post, and for the high post quarterbacking they simply have a better option.  If he wants to be a net positive for the Lakers, his job is what Dwight's was.  Hustle, set screens, catch lobs, fight for boards.  He's not the defender that Dwight is, even at this age, but he is a better rebounder capable of playing more minutes at this point."
"they could have, but also a chance to sign LeBron James and Anthony Davis... you don't turn that down. and a championship is worth it no matter what."
ANTHONY DAVIS IS A GOOD HOOMAN BEING
"I agree I think that injury concerns and also feeling like the signing was successful can exist at the same time.  Look at Anthony Davis. Dude is always missing time but signing him was the right move, it’s just a consideration to take into account when evaluating a player. I just take issue with the fact that people are acting like this kind of injury wasn’t a part of the gamble of signing Hayward."
Him and anthony Davis are made out of paper machete
"Yeah, not everyone’s ankles are built the same. Lebron is a great example, people were shocked when he actually went down with the injury for an extended period.  Literally no one, not even the hornets front office is shocked by Hayward going down with this injury.   A pattern is a pattern. Like I said, it sucks, but some players (like Anthony Davis) can’t stay on the court consistently and it’s part of the calculation when signing them."
Should the Lakers possibly consider trading Anthony Davis?
"Dwight averaged 16 minutes/game dude, he was *9th* on the team in minutes played.  AD is a big, he's the most versatile big in the entire league and he should play all his minutes at center, because he is a 5, no matter how much he pretends he isn't. You're wasting how special of a player Anthony Davis is every minute that you don't play him at center."
"&gt;  7'6 for Williams)  Anthony Davis has a 7'6"" wingspan. (It's easy to get overexcited after your team plays the Rockets.)"
"Yes, after the Pierce/Garnett trade they've done a great job. But you don't even need to be that good. The Lakers flopped around like a dead fish after Jerry Buss died and got Lebron and Anthony Davis anyway."
"Bird - anthony davis Robot - dame lillard Snake - diana taurasi Spider - Nneka Ogwumike Water - looks like dirk, then it looks like klay lol Fire - looks like klay too? But cp3 is in the cast and play for the suns, so it could be him"
im only comparing to other big markets. lakers got anthony davis and clippers got kawhi and paul george in the same way.
i think anthony davis on 1:52
"Statistically Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Rondo/Boogie, then you get into the new line-up.  IDK if Chris Paul/David West count"
"Top 10 in order. By the way, I don’t overreact to 30 regular season games like some do. A 3 month stretch isn’t going to undermine years of someone else’s work.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Stephen Curry   4. Kawhi Leonard   5. James Harden   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Damian Lillard   10. Anthony Davis"
Anthony Davis spotted at 1:52 of the video
"Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Draymond Green, Kyle Kuzma, Diana Taurasi, Nneka Ogwumike, Chiney Ogwumike"
"Eight players involved in that Anthony Davis trade, and I think Moe Wagner is the only one currently healthy.  There may have been a voodoo curse involved..."
I mean he was never plan A. Anthony Davis was always plan A.
My heart still goes out to the Charlotte fans that had to watch that Bobcat team go 7-59 just to lose out on the first pick and Anthony Davis and to emd up with MKG.
"Don’t matter, this league has no parity. We all know who’s gonna win, the Team with 3 Superstars.   Can’t believe they fucked around and let Prime Kyle Kuzma team up with Anthony Davis and Lebron James"
Maybe trade for Anthony Davis... imagine AD and Zion!
If anything Anthony Davis is much more important to the lakers than lebron. They missed the playoffs with lebron added Davis and won the title

Positionless has gotta be guys who excelled at multiple positions. So I gotta start with Magic because I want a huge team and he’s probably the most positionally fluid player of all time.  Pippen for his ball handling and ability to guard multiple positions at a high level.        Ditto for Kawhi  Ditto for Anthony Davis  Jokic all time passer and enormous and a C that an offense can run off.  May not be long until Jokic would be dq’d by winning mvp
Wait till Inside discovers the Anthony Davis ama
Anthony Davis
I mean at least he got names right lol. And it’s not like he said Anthony Davis and Paul George or something. The guys he said are at Least candidates
I remember when Anthony Davis was with the Pelicans he called one of our regular season games. We had AD shoot a technical free throw and he went on a whole spiel about the psychology of why they would have him shoot free throws even though he shot fifty something percent from the free throw line (according to him). Obviously that was not accurate and AD shot 50 some odd percent from the field which is the number he had pulled and like 80 percent from the line.
"Jokic controls games. KAT can take over games, but he can’t control them the way Jokic does. We saw tonight that you can put him on any roster in the league and they’d probably make the playoffs. KAT can’t say that. Anthony Davis can’t say that. Maybe Embiid, but I’d rather have Jokic."
"Lebron didn't win a championship with the Lakers in his first season. He played 55 games and the Lakers finished 10th in the west with a 37-45 record. So, not so ""straight into a championship season"". By your logic, one could argue that Anthony Davis deserves to be on that list before Lebron, because his first season with the Lakers *did* result in a championship and ended their *9* year playoff drought.  Leaving West off a list like this is kind of silly. Without him, the lakers don't even have Kobe to put on this list. They'd probably have 3-4 fewer championships (conservatively estimated). I'd definitely put him on the list over phil, but they both should be on that list before Lebron."
"&gt; Lakers were a ways from competing and became champions with two moves + some small deals over two years.  Lakers are in LA, and they're the Lakers.  &gt; Clippers lost their entire core and became a contender overnight with two trades.  Clippers are in LA.  &gt; Shaq joining Kobe instantly made them contenders.  He joined Kobe in LA. On the Lakers.  &gt; Nets went from fringe playoffs to title favorites with 2 FA signings and 1 trade.  Nets are in NYC.  &gt; The Heat became public enemy #1 within one off-season when Bron and Bosh joined Wade.  Heat are in Miami and also have a reputation as an extremely competent organization.  &gt; The Cavs were one of the worst teams in the league, then they lucked into another 1st overall pick. Signed Bron and traded for Love and went to 4 straight finals.  First the Cavs lucked into having arguably the greatest player of all time be born in their market. Chicago has... Anthony Davis, if he's still ambulatory by the time his Lakers tenure runs its course? If so, sure, maybe he and Lavine can be a Dollar Store Shaq and Kobe and get swept in the ECF once or twice.  &gt; This is the NBA. It's a superstar's league where one or two move is all it takes to build a contender. There's no ways from competing in this league.  K. Someone let the Pacers know that they just need to try a little harder for Bron or Kawhi in free agency."
"Paul, Jordan, pippen, anthony Davis, BAM  Best defensive team possible."
"Lillard, Embiid, Jokic if he doesn’t play elite in the playoffs this year but he will, Anthony Davis lowkey.   Only true superstars to me are Lebron, Curry, KD, Harden, Giannis, Kawhi"
1) Kobe Bryant  2) Magic Johnson  3) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  4) Shaquille O'Neal  5) Lebron James  6) Jerry West  7) Elgin Baylor  8) Wilt Chamberlain  9) Pau Gasol  10) James Worthy  11) Anthony Davis  12) George Mikan
Anthony Davis rolling around on the floor holding his ankle
"I want some size! **Ben Simmons - Paul George - Kristaps Porzingis** (only for 3-pointers and back-up defender) - **Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert** (for me Mitchell number 1 at Jazz because of usage and his clutch time role). Maybe it's not most powerfull team, but I would watch this team play once!"
Anthony Davis. He read r/nba first.
Why is the bar for lebron to beat bkn without Anthony Davis lol
"LeBron James is on this list. He is ranked 18th, you must have just missed his name.   Anthony Davis was probably left off for having too low a sample size. I can see that no listed player has played fewer than 40 games played - AD has only played 36 this season. Either that or he didn't make top 50, which is entirely possible. All of those listed are pretty good clutch shooters - Jimmy Butler was only the last guy to make it!"
"Man, two perennial MVP candidates AND Anthony Davis out?"
with anthony davis i would hope they can beat the worst team in the league. it makes sense to give lebron as much rest as possible
the team that won the finals last year? and has lebron and anthony davis on it? im rooting against the lakers a smuch as anyone but come on now theyre heavy favorites out of the west.
embiid wont be nearly as effective defensively against teh nets as anthony davis. how wiill he guard the pnr with kyrie/harden/durant. He cant sag off any of them in the pnr. embiid could actually become a liability defensively if the sixers cant figure out what to do with him in the pnr.   And that lineup is unplayable. You're effectively playing one non shooter in simmons and another bad one in thybulle. nets will just hard double embiid every time and ignore simmons on offense.
"One major thing you missed is that a significant portion of superstar ""moves"" aren't free agency signings, but trade requests to big market title contenders. Paul George is only on the Clippers because Kawhi Leonard would only sign with LAC if they made the trade. Anthony Davis is only on the Lakers because he requested a trade from the Pelicans and refused to sign an extension anywhere else, effectively forcing himself to the Lakers. It's ""pre-agency"", not free agency for a lot of superstars.  In addition, it typically isn't the front office that deserves the credit for superstar free agency signings. LeBron James only joined the Lakers because they were in LA - they were the worst team in the league the previous 5 years, seemed mismanaged, and even failed to make the playoffs his first year there.  Conversely, when's the last time a superstar free agent signed to a small market team? LaMarcus Aldridge with the Spurs in 2015? There's significantly less ""skill"" involved in signing superstar free agents compared to the ""luck"" of working in a big market. Respectfully to the Nets, who put up solid teams the past few years - they only got KD and Kyrie because the only other big market team with cap space was the Knicks, who at the time were considered by everyone to be ""lolknicks"". They got James Harden because their only competition was Philly.  **It's hard to feel like those kinds of super teams are ""earned""**. It feels much more special when a 2011 Mavs team wins a ring, or the 2012 Thunder make the Finals with a core of KD-Westbrook-Harden-Ibaka that they drafted. When a team ""lucks"" their way into a super team, opposing fans will complain and discount their success (maybe out of envy?)."
BREAKING: Anthony Davis has viewed this clip and is now listed as questionable against the Rockets
"Oh wow, I don’t know how we won with *checks roster* fucking Anthony Davis"
&gt;literally had Anthony Davis      they had him after he made a trade demand haha
*Caruso slowly puts a padlock on the door after lebron enters*  Have a seat m’lord. We just want you to... take a shot...  *Gregorian chanting begins from a cloaked Anthony Davis while a hooded Schroder slowly approaches with a vaccine and handcuffs*
I mean the Pelicans got Zion even though they literally had Anthony Davis and a pretty alright record going into the last 30 games
"I was with you until Carmelo won in 2013.  He had 1 first place vote. Durant already won, Chris Paul already won, Tony Parker already won, Tim Duncan already won.  I'd give the nod to James Harden that year, bumping Melo out.  Then 2018 becomes Anthony Davis."
Anthony Davis wins in 2015 and Curry in 16 would be better
But he just showed you that he can get it done in the west with a proper team? Anthony Davis was very impactful in the win against the knicks only casuals looks at the 20 points and go meh. And dont pretend this was a random regular season game both teams were playing very hard it was a must win game for the lakers and the knicks want to keep their playoff spot. Also you probably haven't been watching the knicks if you think they aren't good they have the 4th best defense in NBA for a reason.
Anthony “Reggie Miller” Davis
Anthony Day to Day Davis
"The Suns handled a healthy Laker squad in March... without Anthony Davis?   How can you say the Lakers got handled when the Lakers second all star wasn't even playing?  Until I know that Lebron can't play I will assume he can because he is Lebron and was putting up a better season this year than last before his injury.  As for AD he is playing at playoff level now.  And the Lakers this year are far better talent than last years team.  We actually have a point gaurd and a big that can pass.  Vogel is a year further in his defensive schemes and the Lakers Defense was number one the whole season with or without their top 3 stars.  Of course they could lose but it won't be to the Jazz, Suns, Denver or Phillie or Bucks."
Anthony Davis is kinda a superstar.
"Fine because we have LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The only things I’m worried about are chemistry, health and Andre Drummond missing a million wide open shots at the rim"
"This game was a homage to the Old-School style of basketball. Very little easy buckets, every single one was earned, absolutely stifling defense from both teams, Anthony Davis was stellar on defense and Julius Randle keeps improving his offensive arsenal.  In my opinion, this is how basketball should be played, teams should pride themselves on shutting down their opponent's offense.  PS. an OT game barely cracking the 100 point mark."
You still had fucking Anthony Davis lmfao. Knicks were missing their two best fourth-quarter scorers and our best rim protector. We both had injuries slugger
One of these teams has the best PF in the NBA and the other one only has Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis is like that guy in the soccer gif who keeps getting demolished
Y’all can say whatever the fuck you want about DPOY (Gobert should win it unanimously this season) but Anthony Davis is the most important and impactful defender in the entire league. I will die on this hill.
"Anthony ""Marshmallow"" Davis"
mani was hoping someone would clip anthony davis getting killed on the court
"Let's be honest - r/nba(and just about everything online ever)  has the memory of a goldfish   There are people here who think Julius Randle is better than Anthony Davis cuz of 1 season.   The only thing that matters here is what happened yesterday, and if it happened yesterday, that means it's how things are going to play out for all eternity, until the next new thing happens."
Anthony Davis is so soft.
Anthony Davis and Julius Randle going at each other 👀. Gotta love it when the two best players match-up. So far Julius is holding his own 😤
"Was super stressed about LeBron being out but then I looked up at my TV, saw Anthony fucking Davis, and felt much better."
ummmm those extra assists went to a guy named Anthony Davis lmfao who wasn't around for all this season.  Lebron had to score more this season with AD out.  His stats are better per 100 and per 36 not just season.  Lebron is having a better season this year.
Definitely Anthony Davis
the Lakers still gave Caruso and Kuzma tons of minutes and have been giving Horton Tucker plenty this year. of course ring chasing and teaming up with superstars is an effective method. it's basically cheating to take a paycut when you're the best player in the league or have Anthony Davis force his way out of NO and onto your team for an uneven trade package.
"I can’t agree with this one. For one thing, David Robinson, Vlade Divac, Sabonis, and Ben Wallace weren’t just “big ass dudes to tangle with Shaq”. They were great players who made legitimate contributions on both ends in their own right.   For another thing, KG and Dirk wouldn’t be playing C even today, at least IMO. KG had an extremely perimeter oriented offensive game, he was mainly a ball handler and shooter for the Wolves. He has elements of both KD and Draymond in his game. Nothing would stop him from guarding PFs of today, he was at least as quick as Giannis, probably more so.   Duncan would for sure be a C, but the rest of the guys could easily play PF today just as Anthony Davis does, even if it’s not 100% optimal."
"&gt;It’s also the difference between Lebron and Steph, it’s not as simple as you make it out to be.   How does that make things more complicated? Steph has been a much much better scorer than LeBron *this season*. This just supports my point lol  &gt;6 ts% doesn’t compensate for their defense and lets say in a world where it does; does a slightly better performance in a 7 game series decide who’s better? I don’t think so  I don’t consider Jokic’s offence to be slightly better, that’s my point. I consider it much better.  Giannis being a better defender is definitely an argument in his favour. Which is why I said in my original comment that Jokic is arguably better instead of clearly better. You don’t have to agree and that’s fine, but the argument is clearly there and not unwarranted at all.  &gt;one of the reasons the Bucks were better than the pels in Giannis himself. He’s one of the best ball handlers and playmakers at his position while AD only has the tools to be a 2nd option. and I’m done answering bc I’m not going to argue on reddit.com for 3 hours  Sure, that’s one of the reasons. Another one of the reasons is that the Bucks managed to get him a supporting cast Anthony Davis could only dream of.   AD definitely has the tools to be a number 1 option though. I mean, he literally was that for the Pelicans for 7 seasons. He averaged 30+ ppg on elite efficiency in the postseason and has had not just one, but multiple series better than Giannis’ best series number 1 option."
Anthony Davis is good but not great. I’d put him somewhere between top 30 and top 20.
"Whos better? Lebron isn’t, Anthony Davis isn’t, luka isnt, Kd isn’t , Curry maybe"
"The reality is Anthony Davis is in peak form and LeBron James looks to be healthy going into the playoffs. So believe what you want. As long as those two are available, the Lakers will be favored in every series."
"I'm German and I played NBA Jam as a kid on my friends sega mega drive. He liked the Bulls, but we also often played the Sonics, because they had Schrempf, the only popular German in the NBA back then.  (Or did we play against each other and I was the Sonics? - i don't really remember..) As it was his game, he got to play Schrempf, so I was the reignman, of whom I thought, he was called the ""rainman"" back then (sidenote: another friend of mine explained to me, that that was his name, because of the angels crying when he dunks). So it was the Sonics and Shawn Kemp for me. Then I lost interest somewhere along the way (I believe it stopped being on TV in Germany after Jordan retired for good), but before that I had watched all those playoff games and the Jazz vs Bulls finals as they were on TV when I came from school.  Then I got back to the NBA some years ago. There was no Kemp and no Sonics anymore, but I had heard and seen some plays of this other freakish power forward named Anthony Davis. I also played 2k (career mode) that year as a PG and when the Sixers didn't want me, because I was too greedy, I needed a team with good bigs and the Pelicans picked me up. They had a really great team that year and that freak power forward I already knew and a good center too (Cousins). But in reality I especially came to like Holiday (and playoff Rondo). He is just a pleasure to watch and he was always showing effort, which, to my surprise, seemed to be pretty unique in the league. Rondo and AD were soon gone, but Jrue was still there and became my absolute favorite.  Now he is gone too and with the new players the dynamics of our sub somehow have changed. I often find myself annoyed by all the drama and the overall tone, but we somehow again have a great (and a lot more exciting) power forward, that is also a really likeable dude and also some young guys I like (especially Hayes, Kira) and we have some really likeable grinding guys in Hart and Adams. So I'm staying, but I'm also miserable most of the timebecause of it and sparsely feed on hopes of the brighter future. Guess I've become a true fan, lol. But the team somehow still is more fun then it has ever been during my time (except for maybe the season when we got Mirotic and played the Blazers and Warriors in the playoffs).  Another big reason is that the everyday hustlin pelican video is just objectively one of the best things on the internet.  &amp;#x200B;  tldr: (schrempf), KEMP, ad, JRUE, Zion and the future"
Anthony Davis is already going off 🤷🏽‍♂️  Last two games averaging 38/12/5assists
LeBron James and Anthony Davis happened.
Lebron James and Anthony Davis
"He's essentially a coach *inside* the locker room, instead of outside it. And everyone knows it.  &gt; “Let’s just be honest: my value to this team is not playing,” Dudley said. “My playing days of contributing at a high level are done. There are times where I can still help (in short minutes), as you saw a couple of times this year and even last year, but for the most part, my value is the locker room, the bus, the plane, the film room, holding guys accountable in practice, getting on guys. Kind of like a coach.  &gt; “But the difference for me in not being a coach is I’m in the locker room day-to-day and there are certain things I can say to certain players that maybe a coach couldn’t.  ....  &gt;  I’ll tell you right now, J-Kidd’s relationship is phenomenal with LeBron James. It’s not like my relationship. It’s not like (mine with) Anthony Davis. There’s certain things that I can say to those two that other people can’t. I’ve played. I’ve been with them. I know good habits, I know bad habits.  &gt; “Now J-Kidd is a hall of famer, he can say pretty much anything, but to me it’s also your personality. I’m a very outgoing guy, I think I’m very honest and blunt with what I say  Udonis Haslem is another of those guys. Except Udonis is more iconic for the Heat."
"Those would be some great teams!    I’m sure Embiid on the third team will be controversial, especially since this doesn’t appear to take missed games into account.  I also don’t see Anthony Davis at all.    I’m sure there are plenty of arguments for who was snubbed or underrated.  But those are 15 great players!"
Anthony davis? not a bad choice
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."
Everyone thinks they have a good defense until they run into a motivated Anthony Davis.
Only if Anthony Davis manages to not get a bruise and be out the rest of the season
"What is this list even supposed to be? What proves that lilard, butler, tatum, Mitchell, booker, Beal, and pg are even better than him? None of them have won anything more than him in the past and none of them are currently playing at a higher level as we speak. If we are talking about a full season performance then I understand that, but the conversation seems to be about right now. I assume you are making your list based on how westbrook played while recovering from an injury earlier this season. Yet you have anthony Davis over him despite davis sandbagging it for half the season before he had to sit out. No one's saying westbrook is the goat but why not give him the respect he deserves?"
"I mean he'd definitely keep a team in the playoffs in the west for sure, which is impressive considering stars like Anthony Davis aren't able too."
"I think having the arguable the best player of all-time means seeding doesn’t matter. Regardless of seeding every year he’s made the finals for a long long time. The year he didn’t that you are referencing I can see. However, that injury was a lot different than this one and the team around him is also not a bunch of young guys.   Anthony Davis just beat a Phoenix Suns team by himself."
"This sub is kind of the embodiment of the ""What have you done for me lately?"" mentality though, so it's really not a great gauge for anything unless you want to laugh at overreactions.    People really forgot that Anthony Davis is unstoppable when he's healthy because he's been sidelined for so long    If the Lakers enter the playoffs with both AD and LeBron healthy they are easily the betting favorites to come out of the West you can guarantee that"
"Look randle is having a great year, but literally you can watch one game of Anthony Davis where he is healthy and plays well and it's a no fucking brained who you would pick.  There a ton of complete fucking idiots on here."
Anthony Davis would have won 5 NBA titles and 2 Nobel Prizes if he were in Embiid’s place.  See how dumb these hypotheticals are ?

Counterpoint : Anthony Davis is undefeated in Portland playoff home games
Counterpoint : Anthony Davis is undefeated in Portland playoff home games
Yeah because unlike having a FO that thinks signing Solomon Hill and Etwaun Moore is proper the Lakers actually bring in a proper supporting cast.   How dare Anthony Davis go to a better franchise that is better run and achieved more in one year than they did in 7 years with NOLA.
"1. Bill Walton would be way higher, and possibly in conversation for being the best big of all time. As result, KAJ would be lower in peoples imaginations. At the very least, Seattle and Washington might not win their NBA titles when they do. 2. Connie Hawkins would be recognized way more as the NBA superstar who got cheated out of wowing the NBA. If he had 5 seasons as a top guy instead of one, you could imagine how we'd feel. 3. Pete Maravich would be remembered for some heroics in the playoffs instead of as a talented guy who couldn't handle his own success. 4. Larry Bird might have another ring or two, ditto Kevin McHale. 5. How good would Brandon Roy and Greg Oden be? Might end up rivaling OKC... 6. Bad Boy Pistons might threepeat. 7. Willis Reed might have been making more NBA finals with the Knicks. 8. Dave Cowens might've ended up rivaling Kareem through the 70s with the Celtics. 9. Unclear how great Bernard King would've been. Also, Ralph Sampson, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Penny Hardaway, Shaun Livingston and Eric Gordon. 10. Would Steve Nash have reached his peak earlier if he wasn't missing so many games early on? Also, what about Anthony Davis. 11. Arvydas Sabonis would've been a completely different guy when he came to the NBA."
"well, LeBron James and Anthony Davis are still under contract and power rankings are intended to predict future performance, not report on past performance (we have standings for that)"
And Anthony Davis took this personally
"The first AD. He was so good, ppl who saw him play won’t even call Anthony Davis AD."
"He won with Anthony Davis as his sidekick, that's a two man All Stars and role players, Mj had Pippen, Shaq had Kobe. How was lebron's last ring 'worthless'? I don't care if you discredit his Miami rings though"
"Seriously, they failed their way to LeBron James and Anthony Davis lmao"
"I don't think 12yo kids compare Julius Randle against Anthony Davis, plus multiple polls here have shown this sub is mostly 20 somethings to early 30yo men"
The Lakers will need Anthony Davis back to his best to make the playoffs.  What he showed last night is reassuring.  Let's go Lakers!

[When Anthony Davis remembers that he’s Anthony Davis ](https://streamable.com/od817t)
"The easiest way to create a winning team around Zion is to trade him to a contender. /s  Anthony Davis is a good player too and it never really worked out. Zion is good but for his team to win, what is his expected contribution? I don't think his current figures (which are quite good at an individual level) can compensate for the others.  Last season's end was promising but they seem to have regressed. The pieces don't fit well at the moment and if Lonzo leaves, can they get an upgrade without overpaying? Currently even Wolves look more promising than them."
"Uhhh they also have two dudes named Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol lol.   And oh yeah, they also have a fella named Lebron James."
"Last I checked, we're still talking about Anthony Davis. Did his offense conveniently vanished through your argument?  So which player are you talking about?"
"I agree 100%. So what do you think about Anthony Davis' offense? Individually, Player A gives you offense(A+) and defense(F).   Player B gives you offense(A-) and defense(A+).   Modern hoop got a lot of perimeter defenders, now who guards Anthony Davis?"
You know they also have Anthony Davis right?  Love the username tho
"Nobody believes in either the jazz or the Suns, everybody damn near bought into the Clippers last year and now it's on them to redeem themselves, the nuggets are too banged up , Luka and the Mavericks are not ready yet, the only person who believes in the Trailblazers on a regular basis is Charles Barkley, and the other teams are in the play in scenario, now obviously the Lakers health is key but we can admit that with LeBron and Anthony Davis the Lakers are an unusual 6th-7 seed, and they are the defending champs who went through the Western Conference pretty fucking convincingly last year, so they deserve that benefit of the doubt"
&gt;Anthony Davis Bertrans  I'm pronouncing it Anthony Dahvis from now on lol
Anthony Davis
More like Anthony Davis since shooting Steph curry
Was at the game tonight. First-team All-NBA Anthony Davis is back!
"I think the more reactionary take was everyone shitting on AD, when he’s shown for such a long time how dominant he is:   Heck comparing AD to Embiid in playoffs alone:   Embiid career playoffs:   23 games: 22/11/2.9/1.9 blocks on 43/28/78   Anthony Davis:   34 games: 28.8/10.9/2.8/1.9 blocks on 55/34/84 shooting splits.   It’s not even close, and 2018 Regular Season/Playoff AD was considerably better than anything Embiid has done."
I’m taking AD over Embiid any single day healthy and heading into playoffs.   Embiid career playoffs:   23 games: 22/11/2.9/1.9 blocks on 43/28/78   Anthony Davis:   34 games: 28.8/10.9/2.8/1.9 blocks on 55/34/84 shooting splits.   It’s not even close
Lol have you ever actually watched Gobert and Anthony Davis play before?
Can we talk about how ridiculous it was that Kawhi was bodying Gobert on defense and then cooking their best perimeter defender.   People talk about how Anthony Davis is such a matchup problem because of his size and athleticism but I feel like Kawhi never gets the same recognition. He does all of that while being the number one option on his team.
"Bruh Solomon hill deserves this shit. 1 year of being mentioned as filler in an Anthony Davis trade thanks to LeBron. LeBron then leaves him out the trade like ""naw, we don't want your sorry ass contract on this championship squad."" He got LeBron injured and is now about to steal a ring from him. This is the dankest timeline"

Pandemic PG13  Anthony Street Clothes Davis  Pedestrian Ben Simmons
"But you're kinda reinforcing the same point, those teams only won one round. It's doesn't matter how great a player you are, if the team around you isn't built to win, you won't win. We've seen Lebron, Curry, Wade, Anthony Davis, and others miss the playoffs in their prime. We've seen MVPs get eliminated in the first round. The question should more be did Melo produce in those playoff runs despite not having teams?   26, 10, and 5 against the Celtics in a series when Billups and Amar'e went down, 28, 8, and 2 against the Heat in a series where Amar'e had one hand, and Iman and Baron Davis blew up their knees, and 29, 7, and 2 against the Celtics and Pacers after Garnett tore his labrum, JR smith tore his meniscus, and Chandler never fully recovered from a series of illnesses/injuries.   That's what he contributed to the franchise, vs. a guy like Carl Braun who was giving you 14 and 4 in a finals run. My general point is it doesnt make sense to justify an individual honor using a team accomplishment if the individual's team just never had the capability of significant or sustained success given roster mismanagement and/or injury. And again, this isn't a low standard, this is the regular standard that most teams apply. It's why Dikembe has his number retired with 2 franchises."
Ibaka started 39 games.  That's 3 more games than Anthony Davis.
"You think we like losing in the playoffs? Obviously I'd love to see the bucks win. I'm just saying no Anthony Davis or LeBron James is coming to the bucks, so we have to build our team from the ground up. We can't just suck dick for 5 years like you guys and sign the best player of all time, and get another superstar for dirt cheap just because he only wants to play in Los Angeles."
"I edited after but yea, to the point those guys were NOT considered hall of fame players at the time of their retirement, which is kinda the point. Braun wasn't enshrined until 30 years after his retirement and Gallatin wasn't enshrined until two years ago. I think that should contextualize how they were regarded. It's not the Knicks that had a high standard when these guys took decades to make it into the hall of fame vs. Melo who is widely considered to be a lock.   Re: contributions, I disagree. Again it's rewarding worse players for being on better teams. Each of those guys, even relative to their time period, were regarded relatively worse than Melo in his era, they just had a decent team. This isn't a critique of you specifically, I think its disingenuous for us to say the 3 all stars on the same team contributed more to a franchise that the guy who tried to do it on his own. We more or less maintain the narrative that contribution or only worthwhile if they result in a championship (a team effort), which is why stars today force their way to create super teams. VERY crude analogy, but I wouldn't argue that Anthony Davis has contributed more to the lakers than Blake griffin to the clippers, for instance."
"Locks Based of Classic Qualifiers: Dwight Howard, Lebron, Melo, CP3, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Giannis, Curry, Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Jokic  Probable Based on the Same Qualifiers: Lowry, Rondo, Irving ,Dame, Klay, Draymond, PG13, Gobert, Anthony Davis  Future: Luka, Trae, Spida, Booker, Embiid, KAT, Jammal Murray, Jah Morant, Tatum"
"What's your solution for us then, redfan? We can't get a LeBron James to come to the bucks in free agency lol. And we for sure can't tamper like you guys can to get Anthony Davis to our team. We're playing with the hands we've been dealt, and I'd say we're doing a pretty damn good job"
Anthony Davis being injured any given week is like a 50/50 shot so that one is not surprising at all
Anthony Street Clothes Day-to-Davis
Are we going to ignore Anthony Davis being injured as well?
Y’all rushed Anthony Davis back to try getting out of the first round after something that took 2.5 months to heal  Something like this happens every year and for some reason no teams learn
"Mitchell is playing as good as he can possibly be expected to, he’s fine. Lebron was clearly never lebron, and Anthony Davis got hurt when they were up 2-1. When you got two top 10 guys you’re gonna be top heavy, can’t afford to have them hurt. The jazz are missing their 3rd best guy and were way less top heavy to begin with.   A healthy lebron led team with AD woulda won the west. They were in 2nd gear and walking into the 2nd seed before injuries kicked in"
he’s a mvp and dpoy. he’d get an Anthony Davis/PG type haul. not whatever rockets got for harden.
"LeBron, Anthony Davis, CP3, Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Joel Embiid all either missed playoff games or have played/are still playing injured.  Kawhi now joins the list.  OP: ""Are the Clippers cursed?""  Lol.  No.  There have been many key injuries during these playoffs."
"&gt; Kawhi sat out 20 games.   And is not exactly an ironman, physically since that season he missed.   &gt;Anthony Davis only played 36.   And has missed games in other years.   &gt;Kyrie sat out, what, 19?  And is always injury-prone.  &gt;Conley missed around 20 and had regular rest during the season.   And missed time last year because of injury, too.     &gt; CP3's loss is obviously not related to over-use.  He's old and misses time in most seasons.  &gt; Embiid, maybe.  Again, tremendously injury prone."
"Hope you’re happy Adam Silver. Lebron, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, CP3, etc. etc.  Just had to rush back didnt ya"
"He started 39 games which was more than Anthony Davis played (36).  Ibaka played less minutes but the difference wasn't that much 955-1162.  Ibaka was a really big part of how the Clips played before his injury.  4th in points, 2nd in rebounds, 1st in blocked shots."
"It's like Anthony Davis. I think you could say the same thing- AD isn't going to be the first scoring option on a title team but he could be the most valuable player, because a lot of his value isn't based on primary shot creation. He's a great finisher, he's a great second scorer, he scores off broken plays and offensive boards, transition, etc. But you still need a guy with AD to be the primary ballhandler who is both a scoring threat and can set him up. You wouldn't have AD having the highest usage on a team, that wouldn't be a good team.  Giannis needs that other guy, too, and I think needs to accept a more AD-like role in order to maximize himself."
&gt; Anthony Davis is injury prone  Is he though?  https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/nuhtif/the_truth_about_anthony_davis_pt_2/  https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/ns2zlk/the_truth_about_anthony_davis/
Did LeBron not load manage? Did Kawhi not load manage? Were Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving’s injuires not contact injuries? Did Harden not take 15% of the season off to go to the club?  Jaylen Brown hurt is hand. Anthony Davis always picks up injuries. Joel Embiid always picks up injuries.   Injuries are a reality.
"Lebron isn't right though. These players had hella time off in the middle of last season and didn't even complete a full season when they came back. Why would they need a full offseason?    Kawhi and Embiid have known injury history with their knees, Anthony Davis is injury prone, Lebron got his ankle destroyed by Solomon Hill, Kyrie landed the wrong way. Those injuries have nothing to do with the offseason. I don't know the details of Jamal Murray and Jaylen Brown's injuries. The only injury I can contribute to the offseason is Harden's because he is an ironman."
"&gt;the hookshot is a lost art. same with the mid range Jumper (especially the post fade that mj made a living on, that kobe inherited).   Kawhi jokic Chris Paul DeMar embiid tatum Anthony Davis Durant   &gt;same with runner layups/floaters.   Trae young Morant harden kyrie   U just making shit up"
"The problem with the ""injuries were caused because the players played too much"" argument is who is getting hurt.   Kawhi sat out 20 games. Anthony Davis only played 36. Harden played 36, too. And Kyrie sat out, what, 19?  Conley missed around 20 and had regular rest during the season. Murray's injury came after he had not played for several games, so it clearly wasn't an overuse injury.   CP3's loss is obviously not related to over-use.   So basically you've got only a couple of star injuries which could plausibly be connected to playing too much and the schedule. Mitchell, maybe. Luka, maybe. Embiid, maybe. But it's quite common to see some star players battling injuries in the playoffs (Kyrie in 2015, Steph in 2016, CP3 in 2018, KD in 2019).   The thing about shortening the schedule - and this is the tough part - is that the players it hurts the most are the younger, non-star players. The money lost wouldn't have had any impact on the lives of LeBron or CP3's grandchildren, but it would make a huge difference to guys like Juan Toscano Anderson and Bruce Brown.   This rash of injuries sucks, big time - but the cause-and-effect is murky, at best."
People here went from cracking the same tired Anthony Day to Davis jokes a few weeks ago to suddenly being concerned and disappointed about injuries.
Oh man that’s good!  Even better than Barkley’s Anthony-street clothes-Davis.
Anthony Davis - Groin - LIMITED    LeBron James - Ankle - LIMITED    Chris Paul - Shoulder/COVID-19 -LIMITED    Joel Embiid - Meniscus tear - LIMITED    Luka Doncic - Neck - LIMITED    Donovan Mitchell - Ankle - LIMITED    Donte DiVencenzo - Foot - OUT    Jaylen Brown - Torn ligament - OUT    Jamal Murray - ACL - OUT    Kawhi Leonard - Knee - LIMITED    Mike Conley - Hamstring - OUT         Did I miss anyone?
So basically you are telling me Anthony Davis will be less useful soon thank you for telling me
"I don’t agree that Giannis is the only player who shrinks in the playoffs. I don’t even really think he has done so in these playoffs. The team has absolutely been frustrating, as was his finish to the game, but Giannis still dropped 34/12/4 on 64% shooting.   My point with bringing up the other hall of fame guys was to point out that a lot of those guys where labeled “not playoff guys” before they were older than 27, and won their first title. LeBron was constantly called un-clutch and people said he fell apart in the playoffs before the Heat. Anthony Davis was accused of the same thing with the Pelicans. Heck, Harden has been accused of “falling apart” in the play offs, and he still hasn’t won anything.   Young guys who carry their teams singlehandedly always seem to fall apart at the end of tough games because they run out of energy. The ability to pace yourself seems to be something players learn later.   P.S. you can obviously ignore this. I’m not actually trying to change your opinion. I just have a weakness for arguing and super long posts."
"That doesn't necessarily mean Lakers were frontrunners after Clippers. It just sounds sexier to write ""11th-hour move to keep Leonard from partnering with Lebron James and Anthony Davis"" than ""11th-hour move to keep Leonard from re-signing with the Raptors""  All that sentence suggests is that the window for him joining the Lakers was officially closed"
"Ah yes, everyone knows my 1st team All-NBA ballot was Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, CP3, and Donte DiVencenzo"
Idk I think if either the jazz or clippers without Kawhi get through they have to be the favorites as long as Conley is out.  Then if they make it to the finals an injured Embiid against Ayton or hobbled Harden and Kyrie is also a great matchup   That and not having to beat Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray seems like it’s shaping up to be the most fortunate playoff run ever.   Yes he might miss a game or two but if I’m the suns I take that
"If there was no regular season at all and we just had playoffs, Kawhi wouldn't have gotten injured.  Anthony Davis and James Harden injuries were non-contact."
"If healthy yes, nobody is beating them:   Kyrie Irving   James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid"
8 all stars should be enough to compete: - Kawhi - Mike Conley - Donovan Mitchell - Joel Embiid - James Harden - Kyrie Irving - Anthony Davis - Chris Paul
"Apart from drafting Zion and trading Anthony Davis, which were both obvious moves to make, David Griffin has made a lot of bad decisions as GM."
No match for Anthony day-to-Davis
"This was literally not sourced anywhere, I'm only speaking on what was reported at the time:  &gt; In an 11th-hour move to **keep Leonard from partnering with LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the Los Angeles Lakers**, the Clippers are trading four future unprotected first-round picks, one protected first-round pick and two pick swaps to the Thunder to get George, league sources said.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27129474/sources-clippers-land-leonard-george"
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
The NOLA Pelicans magically draft Zion at 6% with a record of 33-49 the same time NOLA was trading Anthony Davis. Just give HOU Cade and let them run Cade-KPJ-KMJ-Wood young core. Cade being the new King of H Town would be good marketing for the NBA sales
"I’m also placing Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic over him. Kyrie Irving has a case too, dude kills it on his iso plays. Embiid and Jokic as well... not sure if Giannis is even top 10 worthy."
"From Ed Davis to Anthony Davis, what an upgrade"
&gt; Anthony Davis  You have to be joking...
I can come up with a list of 5 players not on the first team that could beat the 1st team (with only one player even being on the 2nd or 3rd team):      1- LeBron James    2 - James Harden   3 - Jason Tatum      4 - Kevin Durant   5 - Anthony Davis
"If US sent their best, it wouldn't be a competition. We just can't convince all the best guys to play. KD, LeBron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, and Dame alone would probably be enough. Only ""weak point"" would be C and Anthony Davis is about as good as any other center out there."
"Healthy Anthony Davis is the best defender in the league, so maybe AD."
Think of how good a healthy Anthony Davis is. Now realize that he's a #2 and NOT a #1 despite his otherworldly talent. Now ask yourself why we don't think of Giannis as the same.
"No actually, there are NBA journalists and insiders like Zach Lowe, Kevin Arnowitz, Hollinger and Duncan (some of whom actually vote) who were advocating for all three of Steph, Dame and Luka to all be All NBA First team. You act like the rules wouldn't allow the three of them to be first team when Luka can literally be designated a guard or a forward which is entirely up to the voter.  You want an example? Anthony Davis made All NBA first team in 2018 as a Center despite playing PF next to Boogie Cousins most of the year."
LeBron is all about the Klutch Empire now. I doubt he sees his teammates outside of practices and games. Even Anthony Davis thinks he’s an oddball basketball savant.
"No James Harden for Instance. No KD. Or Anthony Davis. Both of whom when 100% would be MVP calibre.  Aside from that guys like Booker, Tatum, Trae, Mitchell missed out.  I think Randle is the most glaring error. I wouldn't say this year is that much of a substantial upgrade over his previous best. He exchanged 4% TS for 4 assists. Which is obviously good but like eh. I think Tatum should definitely be in the team."
"Anthony Davis played like shit this year even when healthy, he doesn’t deserve a spot."
"At one point on MyCareer on 2k I had me (SG), Ben Simmons, Brandon Ingram, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis lmao"
"Notable guys on Winning Teams that didn’t make the cut:  James Harden (lol)  Donovan Mitchell (literally averaged 26 and led the 1 seed)  Devin Booker  Jayson Tatum  Russell Westbrook  Trae Young  Anthony Davis  Ben Simmons/Tobias Harris (can these guys be combined into one elite first team player instead)  Jaylen Brown   Pretty ridiculous omissions especially Donovan Mitchell. James Harden would’ve definitely made it on if he didn’t get injured, maybe he’d have replaced Beal"
"Exactly. He even said that Anthony Davis SHOULDN'T play beforehand. Hell, he even said that AD shouldn't even travel with the team."
"Laker fans, don't think of it as paying Drummond $9-11m. Think of it as tribute for Anthony Davis and his demand to not play center for the regular season."
They trade Simmons for any star LeBron gets on the phone if they sign LeBron tbh. They’re just 2 of the same archetype of player. LeBron is a measuredly better shooter and overall offensive threat.  Anthony Davis? Sure. Chris Paul? Without a doubt.
This is Anthony  Davis all over again
Brah KD was out for a year because management let him play in the NBA finals. James Harden is trying to play game 5 despite risk of making his injury worse. Anthony Davis just got messed up because he was rushed back. This is not the reality of how the league works
"&gt; Didn't we just see this play out with Anthony Davis?  AD played games 1-4 and went out during the 4th.  Harden played 40 seconds of game 1 and has had a week and a half worth of rest.  AD had 4 days between games for rest.  Harden has currently had 10 days of rest.  Even if Harden gets injured, it's pretty clearly not the same as what AD did.  Harden has had a lot more rest"
"You are such a cynic.   I bet you think Anthony Davis returned too quickly because Lakers were facing elimination, too.   ... everything turned out FINE"
Didn't we just see this play out with Anthony Davis?   That hamstring isn't going to heal by loafing down the court and playing half-ass defense.  ... what am I talking about?
Gonna pull an Anthony Davis? Not a smart move
"&gt; Easier said than done, but if they keep this core and can add another star then they'd be a great team.  Yeah, LeBron and Anthony Davis"
I said super team (Cleveland and Miami) or an all Nba first team guy (Anthony Davis)
Anthony Davis
"Who the fuck is saying defence doesn't matter? Do Sixers fans realize that ""b-b-b-b-but defence!!!"" doesn't change the fact that his offensive game is pathetic for a player who is his team's second best player and main ball handler? Would anyone give a fuck that Anthony Davis played elite defence if he scored 10 points on 4/8 FG and 2/6 FT in a game?"
Rajon “Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis” Rondo
Im saying hes never won a ring without a super team (cavs were one when they formed) or having another all nba first team gy on his team (Anthony davis).
Cuz many of us have probably had Anthony Davis in fantasy and watched him miss random games throughout the year with injuries to every body part imaginable.
the window is this year because anthony davis was injured and then jamal murray and now the nets are completely broken when they were looking to be the finals matchup you'd have if you got past clippers or jazz.
Don't tell this sub that. His suspension broke their team's continuity. Ignore the fully healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"Just last week Simmons had two guests on who weren't regular guests (I didn't know either of them so I'm guessing they're recent Ringer hires), and he was basically wondering whether the Lakers should just blow it up entirely cuz their window was slammed shut. It was honestly kind of funny to hear one of the guests nervously try to articulate that maybe not panicking and just running it back with a healthy LeBron and AD could actually work. They were basically like ""Hey you know it's possible that Anthony Davis could just regress back to the mean and play like a superstar next year,"" and it was the most I've heard someone disagree with Simmons in years."
No it didn’t. Anthony Davis feasted when it mattered.
Did we not just watch Anthony Davis and Kawhi fail to finish their rookie extension with their original team?
"""......like the Lakers did with Anthony Davis"""
"Anthony Davis isn’t even that good of a shooter. Much like Giannis, he is someone who really shouldn’t be shooting 3s more than a couple times a game. Unlike Giannis, Davis cannot be a primary playmaker. That’s the huge difference between the 2. That and staying on the court."
Penalizing Tmac for never winning a playoff series with the Magic is pretty idiotic imo. Look at those Magic teams..... He was mainly screwed over because Grant Hill was in street clothes more frequently than Anthony Davis was.  Now if you want to criticize him for never winning with the Rockets then I am with you.
That’s true. Anthony Davis injury was much worse and obviously Anthony Davis is a way better player than Chris paul. No one actually thinks the Suns would’ve beaten a full strength LeBron and AD. That’s laughable
&gt;Has there ever been a player whose had a larger positive impact on any team's culture than Chris Paul?  Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray not playing have had as big an impact on the Suns as Cp3.
I'm a Suns fan and I've always said that Lakers got their deserved championship. The real finals was the Lakers Vs. Clippers it's not Lakers fault that the Clippers didn't keep their end up. So Lakers deserved it. But you make it sound like we couldn't win against the Lakers we won games 1 and 4.with Anthony Davis playing and Chris Paul being injured that series and don't tell me he wasn't. With the way he's playing against the Nuggets. As for the Nuggets I would give them the benefit of the doubt but I don't because they got blown out games 1-3 and got swept at home. Suns have earned their wins fairly.
Must be nice to pretend that Jamal Murray and Anthony Davis don't exist
"Their MVPs this year are Anthony Davis' Groin and Jamal Murray's ACL. Just a salty fan here lol I do hope the Suns go all the way though, this is CP3's best shot"
"And he gets a pass for it.  Anthony Davis tried to call out someone on Phoenix (I forget who) for pushing him while he was in the air, while conveniently ignoring the fact that LeBron shoved Embiid while he was in the air, and then laughed about it."
Anthony Davis &gt; Giannis
"And yet they have accomplished just as much this season. That Disney ring tricked y'all into thinking you can rely on Anthony Day-to-Davis, LeBron, and a bunch of trash cans 🤣"
"A few? There were quite literally thousands of people across reddit and twitter saying ""hurr durr Anthony Day-to-Davis"" after he went down. That's not an exaggeration."
"&gt;The moment AD signed with Klutch, it was basically a done deal.  No, it wasn't.  Had they lost and especially if James had been injured ( like he has been in two of his three seasons in LA ), he was quite likely gone.  &gt; The Lakers wouldn’t have made that trade if there was a risk he wasn’t going to re-sign.  The risk is right there in my previous comment -- Davis' agent literally screaming to the world that he was bound for free agency in 2020.  Davis himself said so, too, right after winning the title.  ""Anthony Davis was still soaked and feeling the buzz of the championship champagne when the Los Angeles Lakers' star big man was asked about his future and likely free agency. ""I have no idea,"" Davis said. ""I don't know.""  \-- https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/30097686/los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-pending-free-agency-no-idea  &gt; You’re dumber than I thought.  Learn to read and/or think."
"Dell Demps, the GM who turned down the 2018 Anthony Davis trade was eventually fired because he turned down a trade in which the lakers were practically offering their entire squad. It was a very dumb move on his part."
Apparently it's this move called have Anthony Davis
"&gt;None of it is particularly chronic or long term though.  No.  There's this thing called google, for use when you don't know what you are talking about, FYI.  &gt;The Lakers say Davis won’t play against the Thunder because of “right Achilles tendinosis.”   &gt;   &gt;https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2021-02-08/anthony-davis-to-miss-lakers-game-vs-thunder-because-of-achilles-injury  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Tendinosis is a degenerative condition and different from the more familiar tendinitis. Tendinitis occurs when a tendon becomes inflamed and is considered an acute injury. Depending on the location, tendinitis can often be treated with rest, practice modification, and anti-inflammatory medication. However, tendinosis is considered a chronic injury and is considered more significant. Tendinosis develops after a tendon has been damaged, and the initial injury does not heal appropriately or treatment is mismanaged.   &gt;   &gt;http://instreetclothes.com/2016/03/23/examining-injuries-anthony-davis/   &gt;   &gt;( ironically from a 5 year-old article discussing other Anthony Davis injuries )"
Remember this year when most of r/nba insisted that Anthony davis was better than giannis?? The same AD who is scared to play in the paint and gets injured stepping into the shower. Lmao!
So let me get this straight   Kemba Jaylen brown get hurt  “injuries are part of game”   Anthony Davis gets hurt  “street clothes” “Anthony Day-to-day-vis”   Kyrie and James harden get hurt “injuries ruined us” “doesnt count”   With all due respect nets fans are delusional.
Giannis has a monster game and yet most of the nerds in r/nba are going to complain about how he cant shoot or make a free throw....lmao. Same goofs who say Anthony charmin Davis should have won DPOY last year lol
KD haters...LeBron got his titles with  2-Wade and Bosh 1-Kyrie (ironic). (Kevin Love too but he was injured for thhe finals 1-Anthony Davis
"The Bucks have a starter out that no one brings up. He’s not Harden but injuries in the playoffs are a thing. Donovan Mitchell, half the Nuggets roster, Anthony Davis, Ibaka, Embiid has been in trouble.    Also the big 3 in Brooklyn have never really been able to stay on the court together."
And you could argue the Suns won the series because they went 3-0 in games Anthony Davis either didn't play or played limited amounts.
"This.   A lot of fans are frustrated Ayton doesnt block more shots from the weak side... but he doesnt play defense like Anthony Davis or even Gobert, although he is closer to Gobert in style.  Ayton plays defense like KG, Duncan, Rasheed Wallace, Horford and Marc Gasol did in their prime.... he stays grounded, he does not leave his man to get weak side blocks. He is more of a jump shot defender who can also guard the post at an elite level.  Hence why he will struggle to average over 2 blocks, but I can see him getting 1 to 1.5 blocks consistently... but altering a lot of jump shots and inside shots."
You are either disingenuous or moronic to cite the Lakers Suns series given the fact that once Anthony Davis went down the Lakers had a joke of a team
The ideal teammate I think would (ironically) be Anthony Davis. Elite rim protector who is also capable of spacing the floor.
"Judging by how the US team has been looking, their lack of elite big men will hurt them. So just like all things, depends on if Anthony Davis is healthy"
"Anthony Davis,~~plus Ayton seems to be making the leap.~~ Then Bam and Myles Turner I guess."
01 LeBron James.   02 Kevin Durant.   03 Giannis   04 Jokic  05 Stephen Curry.   06 James Harden.   07 Kawhi Leonard.   08 Anthony Davis.   09 Luka Doncic.   10 Embiid  are your superstars in the league (honorable mention Dame)
"Totally agree. Anthony Davis, James Harden, All these guys missed major time in the regular season. Kawhi is load managed because he’s injury prone. It’s not like Cal Ripken suddenly missed games here."
"He had a multi-inch growth spurt at like 20? Which allowed him to retain his athleticism and move up a position. Late bloomers have the biggest advantage. Anthony Davis grew from 6'3""-6'10"" at 17, and that's why he moves better than most bigs. Giannis is an even later bloom."
Someone here needs to explain that Anthony Davis video
"Anthony Davis. Great second option, but will never be able to lead a team to a championship as the main guy"
Anthony Davis.  Great player but not the superstar that people act like he is.  He's a #2 at best.  A true #1 can lift his team single-handedly.  New Orleans was nothing but terrible when he was there.  It's not his fault they were terrible but he never lifted them and made them better than the sum of their talent.  And then he pouted and quit on his team his final year there because he wanted a trade.  I don't fault him for wanting out but refusing to play was a big FU to the Pelicans and their fans.  LeBron is an extreme case but even the garbage teams he had in Cleveland were competitive because he made them better.  AD could never be that.
then same goes for Anthony ‘street clothes’ Davis
"But you're assuming a healthy Lakers squad when the main guys are an older LeBron and Anthony ""Day-to-Davis"" Davis."
"Garnett was drafted in 95 thou, Kobe 96, Duncan 97, and dirk was 98. Dwade was a clear miss, Melo for sure makes it, and I think Anthony Davis is there too. I'll throw in Chris Bosh for consideration along with D rose, Westbrook, Kevin Love, Andrew Bynum, Demarcus Cousins, Paul George,  Lillard, Draymond, Klay. I know Pau Gasol started in '02 but he should be on  In a few years switch in Luka, Embiid, and Jokic"
"Except LeBron wasn't healthy for that game either. All that CP3 injury did is make him limited like LeBron was. LeBron had been out for weeks before coming back to play the last two games of the regular season, re-injuring his ankle in the last game against the Pelicans. Then he was on a minutes restriction for the play in game against the Warriors, and then the playoffs started. You guys never faced a fully healthy Lakers team. But when LeBron was limited and CP3 was limited the Lakers were on their way to an easy first round win. Unfortunately Anthony Davis got hurt and it allowed the Suns to advance."
Don’t underestimate the ability of Pelicans to screw things up. We had Chris Paul—we did not build a team around him. Same thing with Anthony Davis. Same thing with Zion. We traded Jrue Holiday to the Bucks in some wacky deal also involving the Thunder.
Are we assuming that Anthony Davis is healthy too if we're assuming Kawhi's health? If so I think that would've been a hell of a series!
You forgot about Anthony Davis.
"AD hurt his knee in the second half of Game 3 and [was then questionable for Game 4 because of it.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2943313-lakers-anthony-davis-questionable-for-game-4-vs-suns-with-knee-injury.amp.html) He played through the injury, but looked clearly limited by it, and then he injured his groin because he was compensating for that knee injury. It also should be pointed out that KCP also missed Game 4 with [a knee contusion he suffered in Game 3,](https://youtu.be/31Yp2g7C89I) and when he returned in Games 5 and 6 he was clearly pretty limited as well. And that's all on top of LeBron very clearly not being close to 100% the whole series because of his high ankle sprain."
1. Kevin Durant 2. Steph Curry 3. Giannis Atetekumpo  4. Nikola Jokic 5. Joel Embiid 6. Luka Doncic 7. LeBron James 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. James Harden 10. Anthony Davis
"That's an entirely different argument there, but sure, we'll break this down.  Suns beat Lakers, AD missed games 5 and 6, half of game 4, CP3 ""plays"" injured. Then we swept the Murray-less Nuggets. After that, Clippers sans Kawhi (while winning 2 games without CP3). Currently against the Bucks who are healthy outside of Donte.  Bucks swept a Heat who were missing Oladipo (which I bring up because yeah, he wasn't a main piece to their team yet, but they made the trade and lost rotation pieces for it, so it does play a role), then were given the biggest break of the postseason with the Nets losing Kyrie and a (much more than Lebron) hobbled Harden, then beat the Hawks with an injured Trae (Giannis missed some time as well, similar to CP3 against the Clippers). Now, they're against a Suns team that is healthy besides Saric.  Nowhere in my argument did I say that Saric was a Giannis stopper, the reason we're losing, or compare him to Anthony Davis as you've claimed I have. In fact, if you look back at other comments I've made in this thread, you'll see I straight up said that Saric couldn't contend against the athleticism of the AD/Lebron duo. The reason why Saric is a bigger loss against the Bucks is because the Bucks aren't throwing a Lebron and AD level combo at us, instead it's Giannis and the much less threatening Brook Lopez, which Saric would be better against.  You've tried putting words in my mouth and claim that I have compared Saric's impact to AD's. That's a bold faced lie. If you're just going to make things up about what I've said, then this conversation is pointless."
You are comparing Anthony Davis and Dario Saric   And calling me an idiot lol
Just today someone on here said Anthony Davis is the 4th best PF all time.
"Even more funny is I thought it said KD, AD? Like Anthony Davis? How is he even considered next to Giannis , this whole thing is a joke. It's Giannis lol"
"Again, reading comprehension. Saric couldn't contend with the combination of Anthony Davis and LeBron James. We needed more athletic players at that time. I doubt he'd struggle as much when Brooke Lopez is one of the two people that he would be helping defend and rebound against."
"Jamal Murray, Mike Conley, Donavan Mitchell, Kwahi Leonard, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Joel Embiid, Trae Young, Jaylon Brown, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving"
"Sure, makes sense. I suppose that’s why Kawhi chose greener pastures. But I don’t see what will be different next year. Lebron will be 37 and Anthony will still be day to Davis. Kawhi has been missing a lot of games his entire career. Paul George had a gruesome injury and how many shoulder surgeries? I guess you could say the Nuggets were a fluke with Murray’s injury but are they really that much of a threat if he’s healthy? Suns with rising stars booker and Ayton along with a good organization and coaching staff seems like a good bet."
"There's like a billion examples like this though.    Like, Malcolm Brogdon is older than Anthony Davis despite being drafted 4 years after him."
"Yes, because the NBA went through and required each player to be measured and listed at their actual height.  He measured at 6’9 [here’s an article ](https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard)"
"this team was about to get swept out of the second round if not for miracle injuries.  &amp;#x200B;  What exactly does Harden/Kyrie getting injured have to go with what Milwaukee has done?  &amp;#x200B;  If anything, it's a sign that you should always compete for a title if you can because you're always a busted ankle or hammy away from the title.  &amp;#x200B;  And not just Kyrie/Harden's injuries, but Anthony Davis too. Do you think Milwaukee is beating a healthy Lakers? They were barely beating the Hawks.  &amp;#x200B;  This is not that good of a team. I have enjoyed these finals a lot, and Giannis has played excellent. But this is not a good Bucks team, and they are only here due to good fortune."
"Durant, Anthony Davis and kind of Kawhi"
"u/triosway and u/SlappyBagg  Basically “it will be generations before we see that happen again”  The very next year Anthony Davis, a 4 time All NBA 1st team (meaning top 5 player, 4 different years) joins Lebron and they win a title. The very next year after that, Durant joins Kyrie and then Harden a 6 time All NBA 1st team (meaning top 5 player, 6 different seasons) joins both of them!  (Oh and so did Blake Griffin after that)  Guess that was a quick generation to come around"
"Dude, they have lost Donte DiVincenzo, all their main rotations guys have been pretty much healthy all the way (aside from Giannis missing two total games). DiVincenzo is a decent role player, but losing him isn't 10% of what it means to lose Kyrie or Anthony Davis."
"Ok, they aren't 1000% healthy, but losing DiVincenzo isn't in the same realm as losing Anthony Davis or Kyrie/Harden. What i mean by saying that they are fully healthy is that their main stars are all healthy (Jrue, Khris and Giannis) and most of the other guys are still standing."
"We literally just had Anthony Davis join the lakers a year ago, which immediately led to a championship. How did all of you fail to bring that up?"
"Wait, how does that work?  “Durant to warriors, basketball is ruined for me”  “Lebron and Anthony Davis to Lakers, I love basketball again!!!”"
that sounds fair. also can we have tyler herro for lebron james and anthony davis?
Most comparisons I’ve seen for Green have him as Zach Lavine   For Mobley Chris Bosh and Anthony Davis are the two names thrown around the most
"In addition to making the playoffs and 50+ wins out West, Dirk made ASGs int he West going up against a ton of great bigs/forwards. Competition was so good that Dirk missed All Star Games while averaging: 22/9/2 ('01), 17/7/3 ('13), 18/7/2 ('16)  Aside from the first season, none of those seasons pop out as all time great seasons, but they were still solid numbers, in the West he didn't come close to the ASG, but in the East I'm sure he makes the ASG 2 or maybe even all 3 times with those numbers. Dirk was making all star games and all NBA teams while going up against prime Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.   For reference the years he missed the ASG while putting up those numbers, Eastern conference bigs who got in were averaging:   * 2001: Dirk averaged 22/9/2    * Anthony Mason averaged 16/10/3    * Glenn Robinson averaged 22/7/3    * Lattrell Sprewell averaged 18/5/4    * Allan Houston averaged 19/4/2    * Antonio Davis averaged 14/10/1 * 2013: Dirk averaged 17/7/3    * Luol Deng averaged 17/6/3    * Brook Lopez averaged 19/7/2    * Kevin Garnett averaged 15/8/2    * Chris Bosh averaged 17/7/2 * 2016: Dirk averaged 18/7/2    * Paul Millsap averaged 17/9/3    * Al Horford averaged 15/7/3    * Pau Gasol averaged 17/11/4    * Andre Drummond averaged 15/14/1"
Anthony Davis has really nice style. He really got everything but the face.
Some organizations just suck at team building. It's not small market vs big market.  New Orleans: Chris Paul Anthony Davis Zion Williamson  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett Kevin Love Karl Anthony Towns  Sacramento: Boogie Cousins  Etc.
Who's my favorite player? Kawhi? Harden? Anthony Davis? Lebron? Steph? KD?  Tell me who Giannis was going to go through when fully healthy?
"And Anthony Davis was injured from the WCF too, lol. Otherwise he would've averaged 40 and taken the FMVP from Lebron. Stop being stupid"
"I’ve always felt he’s better than Anthony Davis but as soon as AD outplayed him in the playoffs and won his first ring, he leapfrogged Giannis. I just don’t think 1 championship should account for so much when evaluating how great players are. If AD had 4 rings and Giannis had 0, I could understand"
"In the past maybe. On the Lakers his rotation has been check out with 5 or 6 minutes left in the 1st, return with a couple minutes left. Play the first 5-6 minutes of the second, sit and return with 2-3 minutes left. They’ve got Anthony Davis basically doing the full 1st quarter thing.  I’m not sure coaches do too much matching up of offensive player’s minutes."
"&gt; With the Bucks, Kidd deployed an overly aggressive defense that would put the unit in compromising positions…Kidd benefited from the opportunity to learn from one of the top defensive minds in the NBA, Frank Vogel, during his stint as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers.   Sounds promising  &gt;The personnel that Kidd has to work with is far from ideal, especially when comparing to the Lakers. There is a severe gap in impact when going from Anthony Davis to Kristaps Porzingis as a defender, in general, but especially as a rim protector.  That is a severe understatement"
"Curious about the players you hate for being ugly. Mine's Anthony Davis,  Montrezl Harrell, James Harden. DeRozan's got a pass bc he seems like a nice person."
Lebron james and Anthony Davis &gt; james harden and… Patrick beverly?
"I’m just saying what a lot of media personalities say, like they usually say Lebron has a top 5 teammate in Anthony Davis. I agree with you, he is an incredible player though"
"I agree with you a ton, I can understand if some debate Giannis &amp; Harden, Giannis affects the game in so many big ways. Anthony Davis I can completely understand that perspective"
Lmao Anthony Davis
Absolutely agreed. Anthony Davis is unreal too
If Anthony Davis played whole series they wouldn't have made past the first round
"Of course hed get credit! Three superstars dont mean anything and the lakers just lost in the 1st round. Old Lebron and the Meldrick Taylor of the NBA, Mr Glass chin Anthony Davis."
Wel with such a short show who knows what she knows other than forgetting to vote for Anthony Davis for all NBA
"Breen: “and there’s his good friend Lebron James watching here tonight. Must’ve flown in straight from the premiere, you always have to wonder what could’ve been this year if not for that crippling injury to Anthony Davis, but he here anyway to show his support”"
1. Luka doncic will not be on the mavs  2. There will be multiple superteams  3. Their will be a team in Vegas or Seattle  4. Rockets are a dynasty  5. Timberwolves are still trash  6. Heat are the worst team in the nba  7. Anthony Davis is retired due to injuries 8. The Jokic and the nuggets will be a 1st/2nd round exit every year just like dame and blazers right now
Zach LaVine and Mikal Bridges join Anthony Davis on the Lakers to form a superteam  At least one team gets relocated  Trae Young wins MVP  Kings don't make the playoffs and hit a 20 year streak  Klay Thompson retires  LaMelo becomes a top 3 PG   Embiid wins an MVP  The NBA expands by two teams  The Nets don't win a championship  *Champions:*  2021- Bucks  2022- Nuggets  2023- 76ers  2024- Lakers  2025- Lakers
By that logic Anthony Davis is on a bad contract
To be fair Anthony Davis as the Antichrist is a pretty great casting job  Yes I’m a Pelicans fan why do you ask?
Anthony Davis or Kawhi could get it to 7.
Honestly even Anthony Davis isn't enough imo. I think you need Kawhi Leonard and even then it's 50/50 at best and arguably still worse.
"Anthony Davis wasn't injured, the Pelicans just decided not to play him so he wouldn't get hurt and tank his value considering the length of his contract.  Asking for a trade is perfectly okay. Being unprofessional about it isn't."
"There are multiple 7 footers in the league that are better shooters and have better ball handling skills than most of the guards in the NBA 30 years ago.   Embiid looks like Patrick Ewing, yet has a commendable handle, a *solid* crossover, and he’s one of the best three point shooters on his team.   Same with Anthony Davis, Jokic, Durant, etc."
Anthony Davis
"The notion that teams have to give in or free agents aren't going to want to go there is ridiculous to me. So if the Lakers trade Anthony Davis tomorrow, future stars aren't going to want to play there? Bull shit. If KAT demands a trade and the T-Wolves refuse it's not going to make a difference in future decisions because stars don't sign there anyway."
https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard
"They are playing out their contracts. So did James Harden, Anthony Davis, and Kwahi Leonard. These guys are showing up for work. They’re just not playing through small injuries anymore and they’re making a scene off the court. But it’s not like they’re just walking off the job."
"Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis also just said, yea, I’ll just show up and play half assed."
It’s not the point. He’s still James harden. He had two years on his deal. This was not a Anthony Davis situation where he used his leverage to force a trade with only one team. People on here just have zero clue how valued first rounders and pick swaps are because they are completely short sighted. Houston took bkn’s deal cause ben Simmons is overrated as fuck and seven years of another franchises firsts and right to swap firsts is very valuable. And that was when houston knew bkn would have kd harden and kyrie for the foreseeable future. Portland only will have dame plus whoever they can get and cj.
"Lillard has been in Portland for 9 years, Kemba was in Charlotte for 8 years, Anthony Davis was in New Orleans for 6+ years. Heck, Booker (6th year) and Giannis (8th) are in the finals with the teams that drafted them.   Teams don’t get to keep the guys they draft for their entire careers, but where is the young star who didn’t give the franchise a chance?"
Anthony Davis Bot is OUT tonight (personal reasons)
Why did so many people think Anthony Davis was going to be a spur?
"Anthony Davis had to go to the league office to get the Pelicans to let him play, way to not know what you’re talking about."
Right now yeah.  * Last season Harden was refusing to turn up and fulfill his contract properly which is why Houston was forced into trading him despite saying numerous times they wanted to keep him on the roster.   * The season before that Anthony Davis threatened to do the same  * The season before that Kyrie was refusing to turn up and fulfill his contract   * The season before that Kawhi was refusing to turn up and fulfill his contract   And this offseason if Lillard doesn't get what he'll want he's likely to do the same.
"&gt; Anthony Davis leaves for the Spurs.   &gt; Cousins ends up in Portland.   &gt; The Nets are a major contender in year four and five of this timeline.   &gt; The 76ers are heavy favorites.   &gt; The Timberwolves and Suns are the two favorites in the West.   &gt; Jerry West successfully gets the Clippers to the Western Conference finals.   &gt; Paul George left OKC.   &gt; Westbrook is traded in either year four or five. Either for a lot or as a salary dumb because his athleticism has left him because he was injured playing like he does.    &gt; Raptors don't do a complete rebuild from year three, but they do a retool and successfully pull off a trade for a super star.    hey this is pretty spot on"
"The story I think best sums up who Anthony Davis is: We’re at the Locker room at Kentucky about to go in, and his teammates are worried about hazing. One of them asks what he will do if someone tries to spank him. “I LOVE ITTTTTT”  then he jumps onto the ground."
honestly it’s because anthony davis is a. a Laker b. has a video floating around that made these nephews erect. the scissoring thing was a rumor floating in nba circles for months. woj even hinted at it.
"You're very conveniently forgetting Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson, and Bam Adebayo. Also, Towns was born in New Jersey, he could absolutely play for Team USA if he hadn't been essentially scalped at age 16 to play for the DR."
Only way that happens is trading Anthony Davis IMO.
"I love him in Trainwreck (and also like most of Trainwreck). That director may have jived with him and figured him out. Normally the claim of ""I don't care about that game we lost"" is already well beyond his skill level. I expect his performance in Space Jam 2 to be terrible even despite a healthy Anthony Davis."
"Have you seen Mobley play? Have you seen Turner play?   Turner is a spot up shooter that anchors a team’s defense at the rim. Mobley is a Garnett/Adebayo-type of do-it-all big that can easily be switched and a wing/transition scorer like Anthony Davis on offense. These are diametrically opposed skill sets and I really don’t know what similarities you’re seeing.   I’m not saying Mobley is a one man offense like Cade, but Green certainly isn’t that either, and neither is Zach LaVine. The Bulls were 21st on offense. Scoring matters, but combining that scoring with playmaking is what gives you guys like Harden and Doncic (and Cade) who can essentially make teams top offenses just with their presence.   And I’m really high on Green, but his “floor” being Zach LaVine has yet to be seen. You can say they’re similar enough stylistically but that doesn’t mean they’ll have the same levels of success. LaVine just put up 27/5/5 on 63% TS. Crowning Green as being capable of doing that as his “floor” seems really premature. Especially when you account for the fact that LaVine was a really late bloomer and had some of the most unusual skill development in a player ever.   Mobley’s scoring was slightly below Cade’s while being the best defensive player in college basketball. That projects really damn well if you’re in the business of building a contender.   I can’t definitively prove one thing or another, shit, maybe Vrenz Bleijenbergh ends up being the best player in the draft and we both look silly- but there are more reasonable indicators of future success with Mobley than there are with Green, and that’s exactly why almost every scout and draft expert who has looked at both guys has Mobley in the same tier as Cade, and Green third or fourth.  Ultimately that’s what I look for. Reasonable indicators of future success. Doesn’t definitively mean anything will happen, I missed on Fultz and DSJ, but I’ve also hit on Trae, Tatum, Doncic and Shai.   If a guy can score at a high level, and another guy does a variety of things at a high level, including scoring, I’ll probably take the second player. Using that as a general philosophy when it comes to these things will usually net you more hits than misses."
"He definitely has a thing for KG and Bird if you're wondering old player biases. Currently, he has 3 players he absolutely ADORES: Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Nikola Jokic."
"Sorry I'm gonna ruin your thread with the only realistic outcome.  3 team trade:  Lakers receive: Ball, Ingram, Hart, Lillard and a 2nd round pick  Pelicans receive: Anthony Davis  Blazers receive: Kuzma and 2 tickets to Space Jam.  Pelicans are the clear winner here as they receive AD. Lakers lose this trade as LeBron will be furious about the lost revenue.  Edited the tickets to 2 as otherwise the salaries wouldn't match"
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
Man Anthony Davis did an AMA not too long ago. r/nba users shouldn’t be acting all high and mighty
They used to do that. Christian Laettner and Anthony Davis also had similar situations.
&gt; Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis exist  And are both injured...  &gt; Draymond shoots 27% from three  That's why it's a *combination* of skills  &gt; You really thought you did something 😂  We're reaching new levels of narcissism never thought possible lol
"&gt; the point isn't that those are the four best American players, but the best combination skill-wise you could put together with Americans  Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis exist, and Draymond shoots 27% from three.  It is neither of those things.  You really thought you did something 😂"
"No player is that concerned about the fine for publicly demanding a trade. That is probably at the bottom of the list if it’s on the list of concerns at all.   I’m not sure a player has been fined for a report about the player demanding a trade. Maybe my memory is off, but the fine is for publicly demanding a trade, not for reports. Anthony Davis was fined because his agent publicly said he wanted to be traded."
"&gt; The NBA on Tuesday fined New Orleans Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis $50,000 ""for violating a collectively-bargained rule prohibiting players or their representatives from making public trade demands.""  That rule."
Christian Laettner on the Dream Team and 19 year old Anthony Davis with no NBA experience.
One of the best times to get injured not that there is a good time. but they are a long time from any contract extension.  Most of the games after the draft anyways so you will probably already be secure financially.  And you can learn a lot from the vets and coaches there as Anthony Davis and many others have said.
"They are in a weird situation because they only technically owe the pelicans two more draft picks, but the way the Anthony Davis trade worked made it so that the Lakers draft capital was locked up pretty much until 2027"
"Yeah, it’s why the choice of Kevin Love was so baffling.  Dwight in 2008 and DeAndre Jordan in 2016 played that role perfectly, but with Anthony Davis not available they suddenly acted like there was no one left for that role."
"Ok… I guess I could have worded that better. NBA players can not publicly make trade demands at all, because they are under contract and therefore bound by the rules of the CBA.  This is why all trade demands are essentially “sources say player X wants a trade” rather than the player saying it themselves.  https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release  https://www.nba.com/news/dewayne-dedmon-fined-trade-request-official-release"
"I don’t recall Kobe getting in trouble. Not sure if it was preferential treatment, or more likely just that the CBA rules were different.  Here are some recent examples of players getting fined for this (but also, LOL at Dedmon feeling like he had the power to demand a trade)  https://www.nba.com/news/dewayne-dedmon-fined-trade-request-official-release  https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release"
"I'm quite confident that Giannis, Luka, and Jokic will be int he top 5. Because they're all mvp candidates right now, and have not hit their prime.  There is no one else I'm really confident about. Tatum was my first thought, but I can't say for certain, as making the leap from a top 10 player to a top 5 player is huge. Like I don't think Paul George was ever really considered a top 5 player. Bu he is defintely on eo f the guys I'm thinking of.  Zion definitely considering him.  Trae and Morant definitely them.  I don't think Cade would make it to the top 5 that quick.  Embiid could still be there if his health holds up.  I think despite their age, Curry, Harden, and KD could all still be in the top 5.  I don't think Anthony Davis will be a top 5 player.  I'm curious to see how Lamelo and Anthony Edwards do, but I don't think they'll quite make it there.  So if I had to pick the last 2 spots for the top 5, I would go with Zion and Trae, with Tatum being the runner up."
Doesn’t really mean anything if he’s going to be a free agent and demands to be traded there. 20 other teams could’ve came up with a better trade package for Anthony Davis. Same with Kawhi. Players have all the power in situations like that
yup last notable time it happened was with AD/Lakers  https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release
Anthony Davis didn’t play 10 seasons with the Pelicants and get bounced time and time again. They were just a trash team that got to draft him because they were a trash team.
Will he be another 7 foot glass cannon or Anthony Davis? Tune in next season to find out!
"? Lakers gave up 2 former 2nd picks, one who turned into an all-star immediately after, and one who just got a $90 million contract after being labelled as a ""bust,"" and the 4th pick for 1 year of Anthony Davis (not counting the extension) who was being labelled as injury-prone.     The Rockets didn't even get Levert or Jarrett Allen because they're that incompetent while the Nets get 3 guaranteed years of Harden. Too many franchises nowadays overvalue 1st round picks and swaps that don't materialize into anything good. But the real reason is that the Rockets owner is just shitty and cheap    I'd rather have a prime KD and Kyrie than a 34 year old Lebron who has been injured 2 of the 3 seasons with us."
"I went to a Suns/Pels game in Phoenix when I was dating a girl who lived down there about 6-7 years ago. I was very excited to see Anthony Davis. I left with the impression that if I knew nothing about these players other than that one game, I would firmly believe that Eric Bledsoe was the best player on the court. He impressed me so much"
"If my goal is to chase an 8 seed with a bunch of bad players I would prefer Dame. In almost any other context especially if Im trying to win a ring Ill take Anthony Davis pretty comfortably and I think the results have born that out the past several yrs.   The better advanced stats part isnt even particularly true, AD's 3 yr LEBRON/PIPM [absolutely dwarfs Dame's in the postseason](https://www.bball-index.com/playoff-lebron-database/) same thing if you use RAPTOR or any other metric that includes playoff sample size."
"Ehh. Advanced stats are too wonky. Just looking at them, it says Bob Petit, Anthony Davis and David Robinson are among the seven best players all time according to PER and that sounds highly incorrect to me."
"Fit doesn't matter nearly as much as the massive gap in talent. The 2nd best player on any first era Cavs teams would be the 8th guy on any of Birds teams.   I don't care if you or anyone thinks bird is better than lebron, just, don't pretend they played with equal levels of teammates. Lebron had two years of great Heat teammates and one healthy year of Anthony Davis."
"With the lack of spacing, Zion’s numbers for just last season are far more impressive to me than Kawhi, obviously Anthony Davis lol, KD and Harden (KD harden and AD  missed tons of games). Lebrons season wasn’t that impressive either.   I’m just saying that with how he played last season, you could easily make the case that there weren’t 5 guys who put together a better season than him. Embiid, Jokic, Luka, and Curry. Anyone else can be debated."
Jrue was an all star in 2012 he was still plenty valuable. Anthony Davis is still Anthony Davis. Omer ask was a defensive complement for when they wanted ad at the 4. I didn't say he was a star just that he was good enough to play minutes and be a twin tower
Rondo on the Pels was great. My intro to Davis was an alley oop where Anthony Davis 360 dunked on some poor blazer. Super fun team to watch
"This rely on the jazz defensive scheme. They guard these players 1v1 Vs Golbert and that something a few teams do. And a guy like AD is great enough to cook Golbert .  Since 2018 :   Giannis Antetokounmpo averaged 36.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 5.0 assists.   Joel Embiid averaged 25.8 points, 13.6 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Nikola Jokic averaged 24.7 points, 12.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists.   Anthony Davis averaged 24.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 blocks.   Karl-Anthony Towns averaged 23.4 points, 11.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists.    Zion Williamson averaged 24.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.8 assists."
"Anthony Davis is better than Giannis, Harden and Luka when healthy"
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
And your answer to the Celtics lack of winning to your liking is to label Pierce empty stats? Not rick pitino the coach and GM? Not the lack of quality rotation players? No it's one of the only two positives on the team that's the issue.     Besides that you prove my point anyway. Even in the west their record was good for an above .500 finish and playoff berth. You can't be empty stats when you're contributing to winning basketball and earning playoff berths.   For example would you consider Anthony Davis prior to LA empty stats?
"Sabonis is just really hard to build around. Really hard. Because of his defense and height.   If he is at center, he is responsible for protecting the rim and he simply sucks at it. Offensively, it is easily his best position. But defensively, he offers no resistance at all. Which means you need a 4 that can spread the floor and protect the rim. Aka a unicorn lol. So basically he needs an Anthony Davis or JGrant type next to him. Those don't grow on trees. The only reason Turner kinda works is that he is almost there. the reason it doesn't work is that Turner is only ALMOST there lol.   If he is at the four, he has to chase players out on the perimeter more. And he is too slow for that.   So, you are stuck building around a center who sucks at defense. Which, unless you are Jokic level offense, it really doesn't work well. What other contenders have shitty rim protectors in the middle?  Turner, on the other hand, is rather easy to fit on a roster. He's an elite rim protector on defense and improved like crazy on the perimeter as well (which means in the playoffs, having to switch on the wing isn't an auto bucket) and he is good enough on offense to not be ignored. He can fit on practically any team rather easily. You don't need to build around Turner... he is someone that fits on any team easily... he is the reason SAbonis at the 4 even gets close to working.   In a vacuum is Sabonis better than Turner? Absolutely.   But with roster construction and trying to actually compete... it becomes a debate."
"The Nets and Lakers are not even an interesting match up.    The good Nets players won't even play that day cuz they old, past their prime and sure to be injured by Xmas.  And the Lakers... no one outside LA gives a carp about the Lakers who laughably got bounced out of the 1st round.  And also Anthony Davis will sure to be injured by then cuz he made of glass."
Yeah but we got \*checks notes\* Anthony Davis to replace him. Who do the pelicans have that can make up for the fan attention Lonzo gets?
"Since this is theoretical, a few caveats: list is based off a blend of career + who I want in a series during their era + how I think they can be maximized in the right role during their peak.  1. Lebron  2. Anthony Davis   3. Dwight   4. Blake   5. Kat  6. Kyrie  7. Yao  8. Rose  9. Simmons  10. Wall"
"Jesus what a horrible list.   1.lebron James  2. Dwight Howard   3. Yao Ming  4. Derrick rose  5. Anthony Davis  6. Kyrie Irving  7. John wall  8. Blake Griffin  9. Deandre Ayton   10. KAT or Zion   I suspect both edwards, Zion and Austin to be much higher on this list in a few years."
1. LeBron James  2. Dwight Howard  3. Anthony Davis  4. Kyrie Irving  5. Derrick Rose  6. Blake Griffin  7. Yao Ming  8. John Wall  9. Zion Williamson  10. Karl Anthony Towns
LeBron James  Dwight Howard  Anthony Davis  Derrick Rose  Kyrie Irving  Blake Griffin  John wall  Yao Ming  Karl Anthony Towns  Zion Williamson
"Billups Rip Hamilton Scottie Pippen Draymond Green Anthony Davis   I think is a better all defense squad but I see you were choosing defensive players with not a lot of offense, except Pippen is an offensive force. I think this All D team would beat the above team."
Sorry my expectations for my team are higher than yours. I could give less of a shit that we have Lebron James and Anthony Davis if they don’t win a real ring
"For several years, though I think they have since changed, the Pelicans medical staff was actually just the Saints medical staff since the Benson family owned both teams. Being different sports, they require different medical and training programs for the players, so the knock was that the football-centric medical staff wasn't very good for the basketball team. Thus, back during the Anthony Davis era, that was sometimes cited as one of the reasons he got hurt so often. However, we're obviously seeing that he's still prone to various maladies on the Lakers too."
"Overperformed and overrated are not mutually exclusive. Take Schroder for example. Overperformed with OKC and shat the bed with the Lakers. Now he's overrated (not according to his new contract tho).     Were the Mavs really going to shoot 40%+ from 3? Hard doubt, but it happened. Not a lot of teams even nowadays can do that. It's just like Anthony Davis shooting like Kevin Durant in the bubble last year"
My friend (new/casual basketball fanboy) said that Anthony Davis is much better than D-Wade and I think I almost hit him straight up.   His reasoning was that AD has more 1st team All-NBA than Flash…
I'ma go with my guy Dwight.   PG: Harden/Kemba  SG: Kobe/Beal (very brief time together like &lt;10 games)  SF: LeBron/Vince Carter  PF: Anthony Davis/Rashard  C: Dwight Howard/Millsap (doesn't need to necessarily play 5 but this team needed another somewhat interior defensive big)

"It was an awful series lol. No argument  Doesn't mean it was worse than butler. He was 8% higher TS% while being doubled by Anthony Davis and Jrue holiday all series, instead of being dared to hit wide open shots lol"
"Tangential since you mentioned it, but who are the top five shotblockers in the league currently?    Myles Turner   Mitchell Robinson   Giannis Antetekoumpo   Anthony Davis   Rudy Gobert   Joel Embiid   Clint Capela   Robert Williams   Deandre Ayton   Bam Adebayo"
So you're saying the Lakers need someone like Anthony Davis? Lol   Playing gasol just gives AD more space to do big man things
"Yeah that’s fair. I don’t think we offer Brown to get Beal, so the only leverage we would have is if Beal pulls an Anthony Davis and tells GS/PHI he won’t re-sign with anyone except Boston, and they take a lesser deal with BOS. I can’t see that happening though. I get he’s buddies with Tatum but if he gets to play with Curry or Embiid, who are better players and the teams are in better cities, not sure why he would pass that up or try to do Washington dirty who have been good to him"
Cannot forget Covington getting destroyed by Anthony Davis that last Laker and Blazers game this season. He had no answers.
"Are there any adults with legit basketball experience who says LeBron is better than Jordan other than Isiah Thomas? Also, why did Wade and Anthony Davis consider MJ as the best ever? Isn’t that kind of rude to their best friend?"
He did get a shit ton of hate dude. It just dies down eventually like Anthony Davis and lebron got when they left.
"Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, 2020 and 2021 NBA champions. That Pelicans squad was damn good."
"It’s actually Lebron both ways.   His haters gas the ever living fuck out of Zydrunas Ilguaskas, Mo Williams as they hold any remote comparison to Shaq. Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Pau Gasol.    Additionally they retroactively made Kyrie and Kevin Love Superstars when LBJ joined them . You can’t be a superstar and your consistently leading your team into the lottery, I don’t care how many all star selections you get    They are the same group of people who never once mentioned The words Anthony Davis as much as they did when he played with Lebron. AD is great but most people had AD firmly outside the top five. When he goes to LBJ suddenly he’s been top 5 this whole time lol"

"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
Anthony Davis
I’ll take Anthony Davis. I think he averages close to 30 ppg this season
&gt;Both are equally dominant paint scorers  And Stephen Curry and Anthony Davis are equally good shooters
Current Vegas odds if anyone is interested:  2022 Regular Season MVP  Luka Doncic+400  Joel Embiid+700  Kevin Durant+700  Giannis Antetokounmpo+800  Stephen Curry+800  Damian Lillard+1200  Nikola Jokic+1500  LeBron James+1600  Devin Booker+1600  Trae Young+1800  James Harden+2000  Anthony Davis+2500  Jayson Tatum+2500  Russell Westbrook+2500  Donovan Mitchell+3000  Paul George+4000  Kyrie Irving+4000  Zion Williamson+4000
lol  Anthony Davis  Anthony Edwards  Tony Allen
Yeah. Anthony Davis on one team and Kyrie on another. Both are pretty fragile
Next year they signed Anthony Davis
"Hmm. I wonder if they considered surrounding him with Anthony Davis, Damian Lilliard, and Jayson Tatum yet."
"D'lo played 42 games. Beasley 36. And I guess you are just going to ignore the Wolves 2nd best player in Terrell Brandon, best perimeter defensive player Anthony Peeler, and a host of other vets to go with a young KG. It really is not even close - that KG team was all vets compared to the 2021 Wolves which had Rubio and Ed Davis as the only guys over 30. At this point, I'll just assume you haven't watched any Timberwolves basketball in 20 years."
"As a Lakers fan all I can think when other teams say ""Lakers must be scared to face PG/Kawhi or KD/Kyrie all I can think is, hello? Isn't the other team scared to face LeBron fucking James and Anthony fucking Davis??? People on here hate the Lakers and LeBron so much they are almost saying their best rec team would beat them cos reasons."
"Draymond, Batum, Marc Gasol, Ben Simmons. Four excellent contributors who I will sometimes see doing their excellent contributing with zero points. And the fifth guy, how about... Oturu. Oturu plus four people whose entire mission in life is to give Oturu the ball. They win a game because he gets sick one day and so Anthony Davis has to come off the bench rather than save himself for the playoffs. He gets 73 points and an injury and misses the playoffs. But arguably this was a bad strategy to begin with if there aren't at least seven other teams in their conference that went 0-82."
He’s a power forward. I’m honestly surprised it’s not more than 75%. He’s obviously not gunna be an all nba type player but he’s probably the best in the nba outside of Anthony Davis as a pick and roll pf.
"Russell Westbrook, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Dennis Schroeder, Marc Gasol"
"&gt;KAT is a better defender than Jokic? I mean Jokic’s defense isn’t on Embiid or AD’s level(when healthy), but I seriously can’t believe people actually believe that. Jokic averaged 2.5 dbpm over the last 3 seasons meanwhile KAT averages .5 over that span. I know it’s a skewed stat and that KAT has had horrible cast surrounding him, but even just based on eye test, you could tell KAT don’t put effort on the defensive end while Jokic always does, and I don’t have a dog in this fight.   In 2020 Anthony Davis averaged 2.6 dbpm guess Jokic is just as good of a defender as Davis? Again watch the games and see that he is abhorrent."
"&gt; Kobe haters logic:  &gt; Pau Gasol &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chris bosh, wade, love, kyrie anthony davis or any other superstar except Shaq.  Who tf said that? Terrible strawman."
Anthony Davis has some… locker room duties that he’d like you to fulfill.
"oh we gonna ignore the fact that kg said he needed to put more focus and grow a bettwr work ethic, or how jimmy just shitted on him, kats supposed to be the next anthony davis and hes busy playing games and getting blown out.  KARL ANTHONY TOWNS should be a top3 player in the league based on talent, but he'll never be one. Waste of talent and space."

"nah bro keep up  Lakers lose this year due to injuries sustained from a shortened season because of COVID: Hospital ring, undeserved, Lakers would've won without COVID being a factor  Lakers win last year in a COVID bubble and playing the crippled Heat: LEGOAT ANTHONY DAVIS BEST CENTER IN THE LEAGUE CELTICS ARE POVERTY THATS A REAL RING  for anyone wondering i hate the lakers and i am unbelievably biased against them yktv  Both rings should count. Just tired of the double standards from SOME Lakers fans (and some morons who call last year's ring a Mickey Mouse ring and then say this years counts. They both count)"
"Money. You’re never going to make as much on endorsements in okc or even San Antonio than you would in LA NY Miami etc. big market teams have big market money, massive fanbases and a lot of revenue can come through. I mean really Kyle kuzma Alex caruso and fucking tacko fall were in the all star charts. Even Anthony Davis who basically got fucked previous years simply because New Orleans existed. You get a ton more exposure and ability for endorsements being the 2nd 3rd or 4th best on a big market team compared to say idk Minnesota. They aren’t bad places but to maximize profits you’re damn sure not gonna want to be in Toronto if you aren’t super max worthy"
"Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Giannis, LeBron, Embiid, Jokic, Doncic, Curry, Dame, Kawhi. Who are you taking Gobert over even for the regular season? If you want to argue health that’s fair, but given they all play at least 70 games who are you taking him over?"
2021 Finals would have been  Lakers:  PG: Ja Morant  SG: Anthony Edwards  SF: LeBron James  PF: Anthony Davis  C: DeAndre Ayton  vs  Knicks:  PG: Trae Young  SG: Luka Doncic  SF: Ben Simmons  PF: Zion Williamson  C: Karl Anthony Towns

"I mostly know her for her color commentary. She's not the worst, but it really depends on who's playing. She is a huge homer for certain players and if they're playing you're basically only going to hear about how great they are the entire game.

\&gt;They literally gathered all of those picks to eventually try to get Anthony Davis  Imagine having a master plan nearly a decade in the making to acquire a specific player and that player is just like 'lmoa no' and forces his way to your biggets rival.
"Out with 2 freak major injuries. Does that change the fact that Anthony davis has constant nagging injuries every single year and hasn't put in a full season in god knows how long? Bubble playoffs were a godsend for you all, got to rest Mr. Glass for months ahead of time which is why you won the chip."
they wouldnt beat moochie norris cole anthony davis bertans
That’s like asking if Anthony Davis has any relation to Terrell. Both Davis and Jovic have around a 1 in 250 incidence in the US and Serbia respectively.
He's the poster boy for never staying loyal to a team until you get your bag. Homeboy played even with a bad hip and injured it further and Boston. repayed him by shipping his out. Between that stuff and the Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker trade Boston is going to have a hard time recruiting top of the food chain guys there in FA. They literally gathered all of those picks to eventually try to get Anthony Davis and his father shut them out completely in trade talks.

Anthony Davis is a pretty cute guy
"&gt;The 76ers don’t have any leverage either.  They have all the leverage in the world. Either they get an equivalent trade return for Ben, or they don't trade him. It's that simple. Ben is in contract for another 4 years.  The NBA isn't gonna step in if Ben decides to pull an Anthony Davis because Ben has always been a spoiled brat. He doesn't have the pedigree of Kawhi or AD and he's in control for the entirety of his prime. His contract isn't ending next year."
I guess Lakers were the only team in The Association willing to trade for Anthony Davis. That guy must suck.
A lot of people still think that we decided to keep Kuzma over Ingram or Ball in the Anthony Davis trade.
"Yes, Giannis is clearly “much better” than LeBron James and Anthony Davis."
"Uhhh LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook?"
"I mean yes but I played out 10 years and that only seems like the case when your #1 is LeBron and your #2 is Anthony Davis.  Unless you have 2 MVP level players you need a very good, almost borderline All Star guy 3."
Lmao yeah right. We should trade Chris Boucher for Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis executing Steph Curry in GTA5. Like wtf dude
"You're crazy if you think [this](https://i.imgur.com/VeSB00w.png) is a bad contract for an elite two way player. Using your ""injury prone player on the wrong side of 30"" argument, what makes Anthony Davis a worse contract than [Kawhi Leonard?](https://i.imgur.com/B9aKYAt.png) He's older, more injury concerns and more money. I think both are good contracts, but if you think that way about AD, then surely you'd have to think Kawhi's is worse, right?  Also, as far as AD's injury concerns, this past year was the first time in five years that he had a major injury. The fact that it came after the shortest off-season ever, and in a year where normal training was impeded by Covid (which is why so many other stars got hurt) should alleviate all this hand wringing about AD's health."
I am gonna get roasted for this probably but Anthony Davis is gonna be on this list by the end of his deal. 41 million player option for an injury prone player on the wrong side of 30.   Also any athletic freaks that signed big contracts are a big risk. Guys like Fox and Collins are a little  bad luck away from being the next Wall.
"Sometimes a draft will have better guard/wing prospect than bigs, some times it will have better big prospect than guards/wings. You draft base on the best player available, not because it's ""consensus that bigs shouldn't get drafted in the lottery"" which is not even remotely true. That's how you end up with drafting Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan, because the consensus was that big men were more impactful back in the day.   The biggest game changers? The MVP was literally a center in the past season, the runner up MVP all season was another center until he got hurt, heck even Giannis is considered a big nowadays.   Draymond is not the perfect center, idk where you're getting this from. He's a good small ball center that can be used for stretches during a game but he's not what you should be looking for in a legitimate C, a guy like Anthony Davis is the perfect center when he's healthy and that's what Evan Mobley projects to be if he reaches his full potential."

What about Anthony Davis and James Harden?
"Kawhi, Anthony Davis and James Harden have all been traded in the past 5 years"
"Starters:   Ben Simmons   Kyrie Irving   Brandon Ingram   Zion Williamson   Anthony Davis     Bench:   Ja Morant   Victor Oladipo   Karl Anthony-Towns     I'd consider swapping KAT and Zion in my starting lineup, let Ben start so Morant can avoid injury and be the spark off the bench. Dipo over John Wall for a bit of length and defense."
"Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Brandon Ingram  Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis  Off the bench:  KAT, Ben Simmons, Deandre Ayton"
"Like I said:  &gt;between 2017 and 2019, Harden defended more post ups than Jordan, Millsap, Aldridge, Gobert, Embiid, Draymond, Marc Gasol, Valanciunas, Anthony Davis- even more than doubling some of these guys. Doesn't seem useless to me  How is that anything close to useless?"
"Disagree. And between 2017 and 2019, Harden defended more post ups than Jordan, Millsap, Aldridge, Gobert, Embiid, Draymond, Marc Gasol, Valanciunas, Anthony Davis- even more than doubling some of these guys. Doesn't seem useless to me"
"Because Anthony Davis + LeBron + Frank Vogel's coaching is basically enough to still get a top level defense. Lakers had the #1 Defensive rating last year despite having both them out missing significant time.   If AD is the monster defender people say he is, he should be in DPOY conversations this year because if Rudy Gobert almost single-handedly makes the Jazz an elite defense, that's gotta be where a healthy AD has to be if he wants to be the player he prides himself to be."
"Because you have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and a solid supporting cast. That's enough for them to be dangerous"
"\- Jason Kidd and the Mavs are \*not\* a good match.  Drama again by year end.  Mavs win 45 or fewer  \- Lebron has a few nagging injuries and doesn't play more than 50 games.  Anthony Davis roars back with a vengeance and wins MVP with Lakers in 3rd seed and low-50s wins  \- Nuggets win 60, take #1 seed over Jazz with 59 wins  \- Ben Simmons traded to Timberwolves, 76ers essentially fleeced since they are the only team who wants him.  Wolves still don't make the playoffs  \- Rick Carlisle makes a big difference in Indiana, and they achieve the 2 seed in the East - runner up for coach of the year"
I never want to see Anthony Davis like this again

They also clown Anthony Davis to hell. Why can't we clown on a woman too? Is a woman too precious to have her looks made fun of? THAT is sexist.
"Yeah, he was good at the pull up jumper and pick and pop jumper. he's the 2nd leading scorer all time but you gotta watch how he gets his points. Kinda like Kevin Garnett who also had similar things said about his offense game come playoff time. Not sure why the guy says im lying lol  Anyways, bigs whos bread and butter is jumpshooting tends to be a bit different because teams dont send help the same way they do in the post and because they arent usually ball handlers they arent changing the entire teams offense.  Another person who is similar to this is Anthony Davis. All of them great players and power forwards, but not really what you should build your offense around"
"This was the end of the 2014-2015 season after GSW won the championship. Spoiler alert: Alvin Gentry, Anthony Davis, and the New Orleans Pelicans did NOT get there the next year. In 2015-2016, they finished 12th in the West with a 30-52 record.  Meanwhile the GSW followed up their championship run by going 73-9, setting a regular season record for wins. And narrowly losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals."
"“Anthony Davis is a joke”  You cant have it both ways. Anthony Davis is so good that he’s part of a superteam, but he’s also called a “joke” of a basketball player?  It’s inconsistent."
Anthony Davis does not deserve to be so high.
Saving this comment for when people complain that the Lakers are a STACKED SUPERTEAM.  So stacked when they have a joke of a player in Anthony Davis?
"&gt;“House… I got another trade for you. Who says no.?Who says no? What am I saying? they both say no! but who hangs up first?! Marcus Smaht and either Scary Terry or the rights to Rasheed Wallace’s weird hair spot, for Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. What if we throw in Enis Kantah?”   *Proceeds to make a comment on Turkish politics that somehow references him being half-Italian.*"
Anthony Davis is a joke
"Lmao Lukas not better then kawhi, harden, embid or Anthony Davis"
"It's not a blemish to lose when you have one of the best playoff series for a guy who didn't win all time.  Hell he might have literally have had the best playoff game in NBA history this year...and lost.   It's a team game at the end of the day. You can only do so much as one guy when your #2 is getting outplayed by the opposing teams backups, your #3 keeps fouling out by getting offensive fouls, and  you have an on/off split of **+41.9**  He got hurt in the two Lakers games he was mediocre in, for the record. Didn't finish either one. Plus we had no spacing and were literally starting a G league callup with less than 250 NBA minutes played in his entire career...against Anthony Davis. And we were an 8th seed lol. You're not supposed to win  End of the day he had a 62% TS% that series and kept up his scoring volume on a per minute basis - just had lower volume stats than usual. Which happens when you miss the majority of the 2nd half in 2 out of 4 games"
"The lakers, they need to blow it up and send anthony davis to portland /s"
"You're just completely missing the point.  You asked why he doesn't block shots. Because he can't reach the ball on bigs. ""average"" or not, his arms are small. 1.2+bpg Shot blockers have long arms. Simple as that, that's why they block more shots. Because they can reach the ball.  Do you think if Blake had Anthony Davis' 7'5"" wingspan that he wouldn't block shots at a 1.5+ rate?"
Mmmm idk about that. The lebron 10 assist thing is an exageration to show massively outplaying (still possible depending on how russ decides to play this year) But heres my thing. If Ad outplays lebron. Lebron outplays Kd. For one series. And we go by longevity of the past few years to determine whos the best rn (since yk one series) wouldnt lebron be 1 then AD and KD argue for 2? Lets put if like this. Lamelo is the best player in the hornets. Anthony davis is the 2nd best player on the lakers. But davis is still better then lamelo. There is a world where the #2 for one team can outplay the #1 on another. And taking harden into account i have no idea im using this as an example. But if i were to judge how harden could play in the finals (Excluding a major choke job) 27+ 10(ast) 7ish. The only reason i made predictions for KD AD and Lebron is because weve seen them in the finals so its reasonable. Weve never really seen harden in the finals in his prime. And for the Dwight Lebron comparison Dwight: team was definitely better which is why ofc i take Lebron. In this situation Kevins team id supposed to be better by a landslide.
"Id have to see a major choke. And at that point I’d probably call Anthony Davis top 3 in the league (Unless russ had some crazyyyy nba finals I doubt that but idk) i still would lower KD by quite a bit. It isnt really improving Lebrons resume besides a ring. I view it as a moment tbh Lebron basically putting it into view that he has been the best and hasnt declined. If Lebron wins this year as the best player in the finals. Imo he has been the best player basically the past 10 years and we cant fault the 2 injury years. If he wins and isnt really the best i think we can realistically say the kawhi in 2019 Kd/giannis/curry in 2021 arguements are valid. (Viewing them after hand meaning if lebron wasnt injured he would still be 1, Because this year and 2019 is the most lebron disrespect ive heard since like 2011. He gets injured and all of a sudden he goes from 1 to 5ish.) my opinion ofc"
Did he not have james harden? But i Digress. This year everyones takes have been this Kevin Durant&gt;Lebron James James Harden&gt;Anthony Davis Kyrie Irving&gt;Russell Westbrook So my take is this if lebron wins with the “Inferior team” alongside the guy Kevin Durant couldn’t win with and Kevin Durant has a guy who Lebron did win with. I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron
Thats.. not what happened? Pelicans benched him until the league forced them to play him. He always wanted to play.  http://global.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25938197/new-orleans-pelicans-sit-anthony-davis-trade-deadline  http://global.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25954077/nba-stressed-rest-rule-100k-fine-pelicans-anthony-davis
Go look up the advanced stats on the guy who’s been in the playoffs once next to LeBron and Anthony Davis vs the guy who’s been a number one option his entire career. That’ll show you whose better for sure.
"**AD (2018-2020 reg szn)**  * pp100: 36.5 * stocks100: 5.4 (2.1stl, 3.3blk) * FTA100: 11 * ORB100: 3.5 * TS%: 60.7 * TS+: 108.3 * stock%: 7.9 (2.1stl, 5.8blk) * OBPM 3.2 * BPM: 5.3 * OnCourt: 4.5 * On-Off: 5.9  &amp;#x200B;  **TD (2002-2004 reg szn)**  * pp100: 32.6 * stocks100: 4.8 (1.1stl, 3.7blk) * FTA100: 11.4 * ORB100: 4.5 * TS%: 56  * TS+: 106.5 * stock%: 6 (1.1stl, 4.9blk) * OBPM: 3.1 * BPM 6.1 * OnCourt: 9.5 * On-Off: 11.0  &amp;#x200B;  BOSH (2008-2010 reg szn)  * pp100: 32.7 * stocks100: 2.5 (1.1stl, 1.4blk) * FTA100: 11.7 * ORB100: 3.9 * TS%: 58.2 * TS+: 107 * stock%: 3.2 (1.2stl, 2.1blk) * OBPM: 2.3 * BPM 2.5 * OnCourt: 1.9  * On-Off: 7.5  I think you're severally underestimating AD's value as a supserstar two way player. His defense puts him into the DPOY convo most years - at worst an All-Defense Second Team appearance. His offense is pretty okay if he's the lone superstar but he becomes better when he's playing with other elite talent. For instance, when Boogie got traded there in 2017, he and Anthony Davis fit perfect from day one.   Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins playing (2017)  * Davis: 30 P/100, 10 FTA/100, 4 stocks / 100  * Cousins: 34 P/100, 9 FTA/100, 3.3 stocks / 100  Anthony Davis without Cousins playing (2017)  * Davis: 40 P/100, 12 FTA / 100, 4.9 stocks / 100  Even though his stats went down, he's still playing at an elite level despite Cousins' usage.  I don't understand why you're so hostile about this, I'm just arguing that AD has played at similarly elite levels as TD whereas a player like Chris Bosh hasn't. Bosh and Davis were similarly skilled offensively but AD is a top 15 defender all time and thus I think AD has multiple MVP worthy seasons despite never winning the award. For what it's worth I'd say, in his prime,  Bosh was a solid All-Star to All-NBA type player and that TD was a step above AD with multiple GOAT worthy seasons."
"You may be misremembering.  **Lakers Recieve:**  Anthony Davis.   **Lakers give up:**  Ball, Ingram, Hart &amp; 3 firsts.    (One of which was a top 5)   **Wolves Recieve:**  Dlo,Evans and Spellman &amp; all of the cap space from Wiggins contract.       **Wolves give up:**   Wiggins and his HEFTY contract, top 3 protected first."
"You said it better than I was about to.      **Lakers Recieve:**  Anthony Davis.   **Lakers give up:**  Ball, Ingram, Hart &amp; 3 firsts.    (One of which was a top 5)   **Wolves Recieve:**  Dlo,Evans and Spellman &amp; all of the cap space from Wiggins contract.       **Wolves give up:**   Wiggins and his HEFTY contract, top 3 protected pick."
Oh this tired trope again. The Lakers put themselves in a position to offer two max slots to LeBron and someone else (presumably Paul George) while still retaining enough young talent to flip for a 3rd star (which ended up being Anthony Davis).   The Pelicans drafted Zion and ever since have been throwing away assets and cluttering their team with negative value contracts like Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams. And this is following years of doing the same crap when Anthony Davis was there (like not hiring a medical/training staff for the team and acquiring and extending guys like Omer Asik). They're a poorly run team and always have been. You guys have been gifted three generational level talents in the draft in the last 20 years and you've wasted *all* of them. My guess is Gayle Benson is a shit owner just like her husband was and the team would probably be better off if she sold it to someone who knew what they were doing.
"yea the professionalism is terrible, but at the same time look at the picture.  The nba window of play is a career that is 10 years and thats lucky to have not considering injury issues, then the culmination of your life work is gone. You are often judged by team performance and if you are a great and you don't win, it falls on you. Yet every one who knows hoops, outside of ESPN, know its not played 1-1.     There is a reason that MJ demanded help after 7 years of dominating including get DPOY and MVP.  THere is a reason Lebron JAmes left after 7 years to get help. There is a reason Mr. bleed yellow and gold Kobe  asked for a trade when lakers weren't giving him help.  And more recently, frankly there is a reason that Harden left the Rockets after new ownership began to cheap out on margins and role players and non-headline making moves to make his job harder, likewise with the pelicans with Anthony Davis.  They had their best year, he sang praises on Rondo making a difference in the playoffs for him and Rondo said hes willing to even consider a discount because he liked what they built, they replaced him for Elfrid Pyton who may make sense if all you do is read box scores.    So I agree, they handle it the wrong way. The truth is the NBA is more of a mom-pop business that grew to billions rather than your traditional billion organization and teams are trying to change that, but its just a unique make up where the players have 51 percent of revenue and its predicated on marketing on them.  The owners may be more replaceable than the stars in most cases.  So with the culture of things, I don't mind players who go above and beyond.  Including your boy giannis last summer and they want an organiation that matches that level and they have to get it right.  No one cared the son of Chicago Derrick was kicked out when he couldnt stay on the court, no one cared that hakeem was sent ot kick rocks in Toronto because he wanted to play.  Loyalty are a few anomaly situation, its a results league.  Somehow the ownership has taken the teams and conjoined it with fans who don't get the profits or to enjoy the wins if they cheap out but have put the onus on the players of betraying a fan base and cityeven if the organization doesn't do them right.  Most players love the cities and fans, evne if they dont like the owner.  I can't imagine any other industry where you are at the top of your game, high income, producing high revenue yet you're more stuck and not able to move aroudn if your company makes your job harder.  The 'loyalty' thing is another hilarious undefined non consistent theme they billionaires have pushed on fans to hold accountable the millionaire players, either way with the next media deal salaries themselves are going to be covered just with tv rights, with some creative accounting, the owners will still be crying and pointing at the finges and saying look at them!  Now I agree, its tough with contracts and I agree players almost never handle this the right way, but the organizations often get off scotch free for making their employees jobs harder. I can't imagine if you're a star employee at any job, new owner comes in cheaps out, gives you mroe on your plate, makes your job harder while you make a lot of money, then blame you for wanting more help or wanting to leave"
"For anybody curious to see the progress,[here](https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/anthony-davis-butt-naked.jpg) is what coach is refering to"
"Question, if a franchise wastes Baron Davis, Paul, Anthony Davis AND Zion is that good enough reason to find a new team?  On the one hand, you're getting stars, on the other you get attached and the team always disappoints and trades them away where they always do better.  Paul was tough, Davis sucked (that he left), but if Zion leaves too? Like fucking A."
"I mean superstars nowadays just sign the big extension and force a trade, Ala Anthony Davis or James Harden. At the end of the day they're still choosing their trade destination  Boston was really good, probably more well-positioned to win with AD but AD still didn't wanna live in cost ass boston"
"I really don’t see it. 2019 Siakam was a much more efficient scorer than current FVV. I understand Kawhi takes defensive attention but 62.8 TS% vs 53.4 TS% is such a large difference that chalking it up to Kawhi alone is laughable. Fred’s size limits his ability to finish at the rim, which is a problem Siakam doesn’t have.  Look at it this way. Last season Siakam and FVV put up virtually the same numbers, with Siakam receiving much more attention defensively.   It’s also worth mentioning that Siakam is not on the level of your common championship second option. Most of the time it’s a guy like Anthony Davis or D Wade."
"Nah nah man we just gotta accept that Devin Booker and Ayton EXPOSED a 100% healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis, according to this sub 😅"

anthony davis made it known that if the Celtics traded for him he would fulfill his contract obligations but that he wouldn’t resign there which he’s under no obligation to do  Carmelo wanted to be traded to the knicks because he saw the nuggets go into a semi rebuild and the knicks gave up everything they had for him which no other team would do since he was an expiring contract and they were certain he would resign there

"Isn’t this what Anthony Davis, James Harden, and Paul George all did?   They forced themselves out of their contract early. This is nothing new."
Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons are in completely different stratospheres in terms of both quality of player &amp; trade value.
2019 was Anthony Davis. People fucking *hated* how he forced that trade to the Lakers. They're still pissed about that.
2019 had to be Lebron LeTampering Anthony Davis over to the Lakers. I remember that whole year everyone was expecting lebron to get AD traded before the deadline but Pelicans were holding onto him so hard.
2016 Kevin Durant  2017 Kyrie Irving   2018 Jimmy Butler  2019 Anthony Davis / Kyrie (again)  2020 Paul George  2021 Ben Simmons
"There really isn't anything objectionable about it except when the players wind up working their way to a team that fans don't like. When Kawhi told the Spurs to trade him to an LA  team, people were furious. But when he instead got traded to the Raptors, people were happy, even though the return for San Antonio was pretty weak. But when Anthony Davis forced his way to the Lakers, people were pissed even though the Pelicans got a really good haul for him. Fans don't really care about the process involved in these players getting traded or what the return is, they only care about where they end up."
"Ben simmons shouldnt be able to hold a franchise hostage. there isnt a single seaoson when ben could be considered a top ten player in the nba and has an awful playoff record. There is no way the owners dont do something about this in the next pa negociations, simmons wasnt a victim of bad mismanagement or lack of support yet he is holding the whole ass sixer franchise in a horrible situation. James harden didnt do this ,anthony davis didnt do this, melo didint do this, hell vince carter got out when he thought the team was going nowhere and it wasnt this bad. think about what an actual top ten talent could do to a small market team, i doubt zion does this but he could really do the same and the pelicans who are the smallest market in the nba would be literally fucked with nothing to do"
"uh, this has been going on for years lol lets not act like its all Simmons' and Pauls fault   Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Harden all happened in the last few years"
"So 76ers will fine him, and likely request return of pay for missed obligations/play time form Ben's initial lump sum pay cheque.  They should absolutely not let a Klutch client just wall all over them and dictate terms as they see fit.  At the same time, what team is willing to take a risk trading for him now?  he could easily pull this shit with them to force his way to the Lakers or something.  James Harden and Anthony Davis wanted out to specific teams, but they didn't quit playing  before it happened.  Ben is a fucking child."
Ah yes the Anthony Davis
&gt;hen you can have the next 8 guys that are slightly worst than Anthony davis.   I'm guessing we are imagining realistic roster senarios here
I’m gonna come wayyy out of left field &amp; say healthy Anthony Davis
We actually have good 3 point shooters but near non existent big men depth. DeAndre Jordan isn't good and Dwight's best role is clearly a back up. I hope to hell Anthony Davis follows through on his alleged desire to play more center
"Anthony Davis believe it or not, one of the best secondary options of all time."
"Id call that bs. The way this is phrased, your best player is anthony davis. Then you can have the next 8 guys that are slightly worst than Anthony davis.   100% that roster wins a ring  Imo, you have to get to top 25 ish to start this question. Can julius randle and the next 8 best guys win a chip?  Thats the question"
Anyone who thinks Anthony Davis would’ve solved our problems against the Clippers is delusional. Giannis wouldn’t have really helped either. Our problems had absolutely nothing to do with Gobert’s individual defensive ability.
Last playoffs AD was healthy he was scoring 26 points on 67% true shooting against actual big men like Jokic/bam and even against solid big wings like pj tucker.    I’m sorry but your small ball against Anthony Davis or Giannis would be complete suicide. Those are the two absolute worst players to try and run small ball against since their teams can go small and still be bigger than you. You just can’t go small against those two unless you have someone like draymond green playing the 5
"Giannis Antetokounmpo is currently second best PF of all time based on accolades.  Anthony Davis may be in the conversation with Giannis if he wins another championship and maybe one MVP, whether it is League MVP or Finals MVP.  &amp;#x200B;  Nowitzki and Garnett won rings, so they get ranked above Barkley and Malone. Nowitzki gets ranked above Garnett because the best player that Nowitzki had when he won was not as good as either Rondo, Ray Allen, or Pierce.  Malone has 3 NBA Finals appearances, Barkley only had one, and Malone was in the league longer, so Malone gets ranked above Barkley.     So in a few years, I see it like this:     1. Tim Duncan 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Anthony Davis 4. Dirk Nowitzki 5. Kevin Garnett 6. Karl Malone 7. Charles Barkley"
I don’t know her but I just found out Anthony Davis is going to miss the next 6 weddings due to a sore throat.
&gt;	Also before she met AD I shot my shot but she shut me down seeing the results she made the right decision  A blessing in disguise my friend. Imagined you guys had dated and you fell deep in love with her and then it doesn’t work out. Knowing your ex’s husband is Anthony fucking Davis.
No way! She is marrying Anthony Davis???? I actually went to high school with her.   Greatest unicycle rider I have ever seen.
I was actually there when she met Anthony Davis. I was walking down the sidewalk in New York and I came across a hotdog stand. I came across this lady who we now know as ADs wife saying she wanted a real slice of NY pizza. The guy didn't sell pizza so he gave her a hotdog instead. She walked off and I thought she wasn't gona eat her hotdog so I started following her. When I caught up to her we got into an argument about how it was or wasn't a sandwich but we had walked for so long we were at the Canadian border and I didn't have a jacket. I ran home to get my jacket and I came back she was still there but the  hotdog was frozen. I really wanted it so I made a fire to reheat it. Turns out Anthony Davis lived in a tree house nearby and he climbed down and started talking to us but I didn't want to share my hotdog with him so when he wasn't looking I ran back home to eat it.

"I think its a stretch to say that hes better than jamal murray and jrue holiday RIGHT NOW, those guys are proven and have performed at the highest levels, but i feel like a lot of nephews here saying that hes the worst out of the players you listed are only saying that because they either a. dont watch the grizzlies whatsoever so they have no frame of reference or b. they only watch his highlights, assume that people think hes good only because his highlights are flashy, and convince themselves they are basketball analysts because they somehow ""know"" he doesnt have advanced stats numbers that matchup with the flair he has for the game.   People that actually watch games and grizzlies fans know that ja is special, and I would even go as far to say i think he will have a better career and be a better player than zion. Ja was the spoon that stirred the drink for memphis this season, and actually led his team to a playoff berth. Furthermore, along with zion, hes one of the most efficient players to come out of college since the likes of lebron james, steph curry, and anthony davis.    Yea he is still young, but put some respect on the guys name. De aaron fox is good, but I dont think he is on the level morant is even now, never mind in the future."
"Age, age, and Anthony Davis' fragile, fragile legs. Oh, and next season? Age again, with a side of ""95% of our cap space is going to 3 guys."""
Anthony day to day Davis is back after the championship season
"Jesus Christ the revisionist history. Giannis at this point was leading LeBron in the following statistics: points, rebounds, steals, blocks, FG%, PER, WS/48, OBPM, DBPM and VORP. LeBron had him in assists and media narrative.  Giannis was having one of the greatest seasons of ALL TIME, he was legit breaking Wilt's PER record and people were talking about LeBron because of a meaningless March game where Giannis dropped 32-11-6.  He was also in no freaking DPOY conversation, Anthony Davis was by far the best defensive player in the Lakers and he was in that conversation, the same AD was also leading the Lakers in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, PER and FG%.  LeBron James is a Mount Rushmore player, yet Reddit has the ability to somehow overrate him and create storylines that never existed, how is that even possible."
"&gt; Cassell was clearly the better PG for Houston in that series.  Playoff basketball is matchup basketball, and it's fairly obvious from the game-by-game boxes and advanced stats that the Knicks combo of Harper and Starks was better than the Rockets combo of Smith and Maxwell. The Knicks' backcourt reserves were Anthony and Davis, and Cassell was better than them all by himself. Adjustments were made, and helped the Rockets win the series (though Starks sucking out in game 7 helped more). But there was more to the playoffs than the Finals and in the earlier rounds against Portland, Phoenix and Utah Smith was generally outplaying Cassell. I don't think the Knicks were necessarily better than the western teams, but suffice to say they presented some unique challenges."
If Anthony Davis is healthy and the snipers snipe they'll walk the West.    But can Davis stay on the court?
"&gt;How did the lakers suck  Did you look? The 2018-2019 Lakers were 37-45. Kawhi and AD moved in the same offseason.  &gt;which stars joined Kobe other thean Shaq and Pau  What a weird way to communicate. Instead of this silly exercise, let's list the stars that have joined the LA Lakers over the last 20 years.  * Russell Westbrook * Dwight Howard * Anthony Davis * Rajon Rondo * Karl Malone * Gary Payton * Caron Butler * Pau Gasol * Shaquille O'neal * Ron Artest * Steve Nash * Roy Hibbert * Lou Williams  I'm sure I missed some I'm just tired of doing this."
"My Depth Chart would probably be:   PG: Steph Curry (Superstar), Darius Garland  SG: Paul George (All-Star), Marcus Smart, Danny Green  SF: Jayson Tatum (All-Star), Mikal Bridges   PF: Draymond Green, OG Anunoby, Thaddeus Young  C: Anthony Davis (Superstar), Richaun Holmes   I feel like this would be an almost perfect blend of shooting, self creation, passing, and defense throughout the entire team."
"&gt; All legends for a reason  Ah yes, the 11th best player of all time, Neil Johnston.  I also always knew Anthony Davis was the 3rd greatest player in NBA history.  Andre Drummond over John Stockton? Who wouldn't think that?"
"An underrated factor in the MVP race (and this is true every year) is that a player who has never won it always has a leg up on those who have. The NBA is not like football or baseball, in that the voters like to spread it around and give new players the award. Because of this fact alone, I think it would be unwise to count out Anthony Davis as a candidate. If the Lakers finish with the league's best record (or #1 seed in the West) then there are definitely going to be voters who will want to reward someone from the Lakers. If AD has a great season, he's got a shot. I don't think he should be the favorite to win this year or anything like that, but he's got an edge there that LeBron, KD and Harden do not, just cause he's never won it before."
"PG: Steph Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: Jayson Tatum  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  Bench: RoCo, Issac, Lamelo, Mikal Bridges, Myles Turner, Andrew Wiggins, MPJ  My starting lineup is just the 2017 Warriors except I upgraded Klay to PG, downgraded KD to Tatum, and gave them AD to completely destroy their biggest weakness  My bench is just valuable role players mostly 3 and D and Lamelo and MPJ to boost the offense  Gave myself an extra challenge of not putting any borderline stars in here like Fox and SGA. MPJ is the closest and I don’t believe he’s on the other guys level"
&gt; Ricky Davis for shooting at his own basket to get a rebound for a triple double.  Then we also have to nominate Anthony Bowie who called a timeout in the final seconds of a blowout win just to set up an assist for his triple-double.
Kawhi keeps getting injured any time he goes all out for a stretch. He's the worst example possible except Anthony Davis. They are great players made of glass.
Anthony Davis for having ugly ass eyebrows and joining LeRecruit just to win an asterisk ring
"In mid-2010, Drummond was the #1 ranked prospect in the 2012 HS class and potential #1 pick in the 2013 draft. After reclassifying and leaving HS earlier (as he had completed the NCAA's academic entry requirements early), he was #2 ranked prospect in the 2011 HS class (behind Anthony Davis), and considered a potential top 3 pick in the 2012 draft before his so-so freshman season at UConn. Definitely a steal to get him where the Pistons did, as he only turned 19 just after the draft (very young for his class, as young as a lot of prep-to-pro entries, when that was still a thing), and had an awesome starting base of size and athleticism to work with. It was all a question of his drive and application. In hindsight, Detroit was probably one of the worst places for his development. He needed a consistent veteran influence, and steady firm coaching, to keep him on track in games and in development."
"Steph Curry is unique, in that his shooting is unlike anyone who has ever played NBA.  Anthony Davis is generational, in that his skills as a center come along about once a generation.  Unique is more rare than generational."
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
"Back then, this would work. One example is David Robinson and Tim Duncan who won chips in '99 and '03.  Today though, the NBA emphasizes spacing and shooting from distance, so unless your other great center is lights-out from 3, your team wouldn't go anywhere. One example is Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis on New Orleans in 2017."
"Love this list. However, I would have to be sold on Anthony Davis."
Imagine a team with LeBron and Drummond as well as Anthony Davis. Surely that team wins a championship
"Bro, you always speak like you’re in the Lakers front office. You’re a Warriors fan… I follow the Lakers wayyy closer than you. Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis will be the dominant force of this Lakers team during the regular season. I can promise you that."
Anthony Davis back into the top 5.
"Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard or Nurkic. Lol ok. Didn’t know Nurkic was a defensive savant. That Blazers team had no defense, we all saw it in the bubble and after."
This literally just happened with Anthony Davis and Lakers got a ring.  And Kawhi the year before.
Lakers would be the 2012-16 OKC but with Anthony freaking Davis albeit a regressed version of Russ. They'd also have better shooting than those Thunder teams tho probably a slight worse defence.   I think Harden and LeBron will be somewhat of a weird fit but it would still work don't get me wrong. Having that much spacing around Bron would be insane   Really if LeBron goes back to his 2020 form then I'd be hard pressed betting against the Nets but if he has regressed then I'd go Lakers. Would be a really close series anyways
I think Lebron and Anthony Davis scissoring takes the cake
That Anthony Davis report is a complete fantasy. That Pacers roster didn’t have anything to trade for him
LeBrons injury rate has drastically increased the last few years because of age in all likelihood. Couple that was Anthony Day to Davis and it wouldnt surprised me at all.

Ahh the team of misfits:  Mr.Anthony “You’ll find me hobbling on the floor” Davis  Mr. Russel “I’m just jacking it” Westbrook  Mr. Carmelo “Don’t call me overrated” Anthony  Mr. Rajon “they call me tough” Rondo  Mr. Deandre “I just wanna be in LA eating veggies” Jordan  Mr. Dwight “I call myself Superman” Howard
" [Spears] LeBron James yelled, “What the fuck?!” Carmelo Anthony gave a look of expected disappointment. Russell Westbrook belted, “I’ve got an [expletive] ejection now.” And before Anthony Davis hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star and living human being Kobe Bryant hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all disrespect my franchise.”"
"I agree, they should trade Center Anthony Davis to the Mavericks."
Neither should’ve been on there or Anthony Davis or Dame Lillard.
"Harrison 'Anthony Davis on Feb 6, 2015' Barnes"
"Right cus no other player has ever wanted out of any other franchises.  We've had one player in recent memory not want to be in New Orleans; Anthony Davis.  Chris Paul wanted to stay in New Orleans, he loved the city, but saw that his current situation wasn't working and asked for a trade. He's said before that he cried when he got traded because there was a part of him that didn't want to leave."
"On a side note, how the heck is Anthony Davis a -7 tonight? That's just sad."
Why the fuck would Anthony Davis not shoot the three
"Imagine believing a single word this woman has to say. Shelburne isn't a journalist. She's just an ass kisser and mouthpiece for Klutch. This is the same person who said the backlash and furor from AD forcing his way out of [New Orleans was due to Rich Paul being black](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/ramona-shelburne-anthony-davis-race-espn/u35t34uy8mgm108tmhcwt3fjs) and endlessly protects Simmons and gives him the most absurd praise. Earlier this month [she called Simmons a ""transcendent player""](https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1449070453608181760) (lmao)."
Apparently Anthony Davis and Dame Lillard given the way people talk about them the last week.
"Anthony Davis and Embiid speedrunning their NBA careers. full sprint, until their bodies give out  AD will play, but should he?"
"Easiest answer for me is Hakeem. Face up game? Check. Post game? Check. Can spread to the midrange? Check. Easily one of the greatest defenders of al time. You smack Draymonds versatility with the paint presence of Gobert and you have a SEMBLANCE of how spectacular Hakeem was. I know the 3 is sexy but for the past few years we’ve seen that big men still have a place in this league and if you put one in a good position to dominate, you might just win your title. If Anthony Davis can be the best player (for that run) of a championship team, you can be damned sure Hakeem can and more."
"They don't. but he's known for sitting out games and getting little knocks that'll keep him out a half or a game everynow and again. nobody is saying ''Anthony Day-to-get-fucking-injured-already-Davis''    You're blowing it out of proportion man. People just joking because he sits out a lot of games because he gets banged up quickly, nobody out here wishing he gets injured and is out a whole season."
"Nah. Lebron has hardly even best the best player in a finals series.   2007 - Tony Parker  2011 - Dirk/Wade  2012 - Durant  2013 - I guess but he also choked.  2014 - Kawhi  2015 - Steph  2016 - Draymond/Irving  2017 - Durant  2018 - Durant  2020 - Anthony Davis  He'd a zero time champion if he wasn't bailed out by Kyrie and Allen, Draymond suspended, and carried by AD.  How many of these games did you actually watch?"
Bro saying “injuries are the worst” wasn’t sincere be honest. You legit only wrote that so that you could switch it to a Whataboutism involving AD.   I agree with A lot of you Laker fans too by the way (not the complaining about the fanbase being made fun of over here because that comes with the territory) the Jokes about Anthony Davis being hurt are goofy asf. I don’t like em when Charles Barkley does it and I don’t like it when people on this sub do it
"To be fair Anthony Davis’ numbers are hardly any better from those spots, but I’ve always thought he should really cut down on the post up fadeaway shots as well.   It’s just not efficient basketball, but I think a lot of big guys get away with it because their easy buckets around the rim keep their FG% over 50 so nobody wants to call them inefficient even though they have hugely inefficient parts of their game."
"So, a worse Anthony Davis? Gotcha."
He ain't called Anthony Day-to-Davis for nothing tbh
Anthony Davis 3P%: .301  Joel Embiid 3P%: .330
I really don't like watching Anthony Davis. In the series vs the Blazers he just flopped at the most miniscule contact and got to the line.
"I was under the impression, perhaps false, that Anthony Davis was a top 75 player, all time, and the best player on the court last night.  Sure it’s just the regular season and the Lakers will figure it out, but winning overtime against the Spurs isn’t an achievement for a contender, it’s a warning sign."
"- Harrison Barnes is top 5 in FTA per game, higher than James Harden, Trae Young and Joel Embiid.  - Kyle Kyzma is top 5 in RPG (rebounds per game), higher than his former teammate Anthony Davis.   - Kevin Porter Jr. is averaging 6.3 turnovers per game to start the season, by far the league leader in this category."
Anthony Davis is too skinny to make it in the nba. This was during all his draft hype.
Anthony Davis is washed up and lives at the free throw line.   There are certain players that get special treatment in the league and he is one of them. James Harden KD AD LeBron Giannis Luka Probs Dame
"I'll never forget his nbadraft.net profile.   ""Could turn out better than Anthony Davis"""
"Ur comparing 5v5 skills too much when it comes down to a 1v1. Bottom line is prime dwight was significantly stronger than AD. In a 1v1 hes just going to back him down all game and that lil floater is gonna be money all day long. AD is not strong enough to defend prime dwight, thats my opinion. And prime dwight is going to out rebound him. Anthony Davis sure as hell isn't going to back prime AD down that would be laughable, hes going to be scared. Hes probably going to just shoot mid ranges all game (which hes not even that great at % wise) and I just don't see that beating prime Dwight.  Just my opinion. I think when it comes to center 1v1 you have to account for strength and size"
"Because even during their best days. Lakers lineup with LeBron and AD needs elite shooters next to them. It's not only because of they are elite shooters. Specially LeBron is underrated shooter. It's mostly because LeBron and AD's two man inside outside game needs multiple floor spacers on the floor. Not another ball handler specially if he is terrible shooter. I'm not even talking about defense. LeBron and AD literally creates elite defense by themselves during playoffs. But they do need someone who can defend opponent ball handlers in halfcourt game and closeouts. Buddy Hield instead of Westbrook means keeping Caruso and KCP as well. Imagine Caruso, Hield, KCP, LeBron, Davis lineup and compare it with Westbrook, Monk, Ariza/THT/Anthony, LeBron Davis lineup. Lakers won championship with elite defense not with greatest offense ever."
After summer league in 2012 I said Sullinger will get an MVP within 7 years and be better than Anthony Davis. Oh sorry I didn't see it was WORST take.

"This is how I know you didn't know anything about Anthony Davis before he went to the Lakers lol  He always used to get hurt. Little things here and there, miss a game or two, because his body is definitely fragile sometimes. Even though he's been known for YEARS to ACTUALLY GET HURT people still mock him for getting banged up and also mock him for not playing more aggressively in the post"
**LOWRY**  THIS DUDE JUST SAID KYLE LOWRY HAS HAD A BETTER CAREER THAN ANTHONY DAVIS HAHAAAAAAA
"Yep, and meanwhile he's not nearly as injury prone as a bunch of other superstars are. Look at the number of missed regular season games over the last 5 seasons before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  Why is AD the one who's considered the most injury prone?"
Anthony “day-to-day” Davis ladies and gents
"The main difference being that Anthony Davis is a vastly better basketball player than Scottie Pippen.  If Jordan fans gassed up Mo Will, Tristan Thompson,  etc. that would be one thing. But let's not act like AD hasn't been a perennial 1st Team all NBA guy, MVP candidate, DPOY candidate and put up monster 28/12/4/4 seasons in NOP."
"My honourable mention: Anthony Davis is a better player than Jokic, end of 2019.   It's not that bad at the time you could make a case for ADs defence and he had a great year but in hindsight..."
"You must have not ever seen prime Dwight play. In a game to 20 I don't even think AD cracks 10 on prime Dwight and if its make it take it and Dwight gets the ball first it might be 20-0.   And thats with all due respect to Anthony Davis hes an amazing player, but prime Dwight? Prime?"
"Great win, we didn’t quit, and kept the intensity.  **Positives**: Russell Westbrook (33,10,8) and Anthony Davis (35 and 17) had big games. R. Westbrook especially made a couple of important baskets down the stretch. Malik Monk was solid also. We didn’t give up mentally overall down the stretch.  **Negatives**: We have clear defensive issues. We were making Jakob Peotl look like the second coming of George Mikan out there, it was ridiculous. We gotta defend the pick and roll a bit better. Also, we need to do a better job rebounding. We need to go back to the fundamental point of boxing out. We have been giving up too many offensive rebounds, which lead to second chance points (16 to 9 for SAS today), and with the size we have, we have no excuses for this to happen. Finally, we struggled from 3 (26%). LeBron has been our best shooter from 3, and his absence was felt in this area today."
"Some stat head out there should put together Anthony Davis stats of laying on the floor per game, Falls per game, how much time he actually lays around on the floor vs how much time he actually runs"
Only a few more weeks until we never have to see the 'Anthony Davis has already peaked' unpopular opinion again
"It's easy just simply have an Anthony Davis, not sure why more teams don't try that strategy.  Good game though! Always love beating the Spurs."
"A tough game, but Westbrook had his best game so far as a Laker, and fortunately we had [evil Anthony Davis](https://i.redd.it/kpsm70v7g1v71.jpg) on our side."
Anthony Davis is exceptionally overrated.
"Anthony ""Day to Day"" Davis"
"anthony davis, easily."
i think anthony davis is overrated and I hate the lakers but making fun of him for getting injured is pathetic and anyone doing it should feel bad
can we replace anthony davis' legs with robot legs yet
Probably Anthony Davis bitchass
Anthony Day-to-Davis
Anthony Day to Davis back at it again 😢
Anthony Day to Davis
Anthony Davis being a two-way force is why this game is even competitive.
"I believe the critique is that Anthony Davis should be a better product because of his length and hyper-versatility.  It’s contradictory, but yeah."
ANTHONY FUCKING DAVIS
Keldon Johnson just took Anthony Davis in the post.  # B I G  # B O D Y
Anthony Davis pantomimes a catastrophic injury twice a game.
"Watching the Lakers develop Ball, Ingram, Caruso, Randle, Zubac Russell, Kuz etc etc for the next 7 years would be more fun the current timeline we are in.  Lakers have a 1-2 window left watching Lebron give up in playoff time (which, is understandable given he's 39 years old), Anthony Davis in Street Clothes, and Russell Westbrook play hero ball and then we spend the next 5 years being 10-12 seed.  &amp;#x200B;  dont @ me"
"If Westbrook can't even win a single ring after a career of playing with James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James and Anthony Davis there is no way he escapes the failure label."
At no point in either of their careers has Giannis been better than Anthony Davis
"I'll take Jokic over AD because AD is injury prone. I also value playmaking a lot more than any other aspect of the game. That's just my preference. But AD is a monster on both ends and though Jokic is a generational talent offensively, he is average at best defensively.   Also, if anything Anthony Davis being on the Lakers with Lebron has people underrating him. With addition to his weak play due to injury for the past year, people are forgetting that he was unstoppable during the championship run."
How did I know before coming here that it was gonna be 75% shitting on Anthony Davis and Lebron lmfao never change r/NBA
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
"Anthony Davis is, and always has been, massively overrated."
Trae young got the same contract as Luka.   So...suggests he is also a supermax rookie extension player.  And what about Donovan Mitchell's 5 195 rookie max?  What about Paul George? Kevin Durant?  Anthony Davis? Jimmy Butler?
Anthony Davis is overrated.
anthony davis has already peaked
"KG and Pierce were both top 10 in a bunch of advanced stats in 08, including winshares (and winshares/48) and VORP.   All three of them were in their very early 30s, and by all accounts still in their prime (albeit nearing the end of their prime.) KG was pretty widely accepted as a top 5/6 player and PP was seen as top 10. Ray Allen was hovering around 20th. Maybe not MVP contenders, but it would be like Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, and Bam or Beal joining up right now. IMO a superteam.   You're right though, not on the same level as the Heatles or especially Warriors"
That’s tough to say cause we haven’t had an amazing rookie big in a while.  The only rookie big who was a big deal and didn’t get ROTY in the past few years is Anthony Davis.  There just really aren’t other ones.
It’s fine to be a superstar and not want to be an outspoken leader.    Anthony Davis doesn’t have a leadership bone in his body and he’s still doing fine

I would argue that Zach Lavine/Donovan Mitchell archetype isn’t as good as Anthony Davis/ Bam Adebayo archetype
"Yeah, you can definitely see Mobley in that Anthony Davis mold, but better as a playmaker"
"Shouldn't the Lakers be more composed as the oldest team in the league? They have all played through bad calls before. They lost their cool and dug themselves a hole they were unable to climb out of.   Lakers got every call in the third, being in the bonus with 9:00 left in the quarter and the sun's stayed composed and won the quarter by a large margin.   There were missed calls both ways. And the Lakers shot more freethrows as a team. And the reffing is not an excuse when russ was shooting 3/12 prior to garbage time and Anthony Davis was 1/11 in the paint."
" After a physical layup or dunk absolutely you'll see guys hit the deck.  But my original comment was talking about guys that go to the ground for seemingly no reason. I mostly made the post about Jae Crowder who will be on his back on every three point attempt reguardless of it being contested or not.  The first guy who responded brought up Anthony Davis, who will ofter go to his back after wide open dunks. Even the Lakers announcers last night noted the fact that he is on the ground more than most players.  And whenever I see Davis on the ground it makes me think the worst due to his history.   I decided to argue with u/heynow16 because he is in every thread picking a fight and uses the idea that everyone hates Lakers fans to fuel his ignorance.   &gt;It’s ok. Everyone hates our team, we’re allowed to hate teams as well."
"Let me ask you a simple question that encapsulates my point. If you were the pelicans, would you rather Anthony Davis say nothing, while you sign and trade for bloated salaries to build a playoff team around him, and he leaves after his contract is over leaving you absolutely screwed for the next few years. Or would you rather he bitch and moan and force his way out and you end up with four young players and draft assets. If you had to choose one of these, which one would it be?"
"So what Anthony Davis did is the ideal way. He waited until it was a year and some change left which made for a good trade package.   What Harden, Simmons is doing is the wrong way."
"""Street Clothes"" for Anthony Davis, is it mean? Yes , did I laugh my ass off when I first heard it? Absolutely"
*Anthony Davis has left the chat with his shitty Ruffles*
"Because his teammates celebrated when he left the Rockets, Hawks, Hornets, and Wizards. I agree that he should be on the top 75 list, and people like Anthony Davis shouldnt, but Dwight's rubbed a lot of his peers and the media the wrong way throughout his career (like when he tried to be buddy buddy in front of the press with SVG after trying to get him fired).      He's kind of like Terrell Owens in that regard"
"&gt; adding a championship  yeah averaging 2.8ppg and 2.8rpg in 11.8mpg in the finals really outweighs most of a decade of generally being an underachiever with a giant ego in his post prime and wearing out his welcome everywhere else he'd been. I agree Dwight should've gotten in anyway over some of those guys from the 50s/60s and Anthony Davis, but LeBron winning a title for a team that Dwight joined and played a limited playoff role isn't a major factor."
"This could work if they structure it properly. Similar to what Anthony Davis did when he waived the trade kicker in order to facilitate his trade to the Lakers, I could see the league structuring anything over 25% cap with a ""reverse trade kicker"" that pays out as long as you're on the original team but can be waived by the player if they want to facilitate a trade to a new team. Everyone's thinking about Ben Simmons, but think of the benefit to someone like John Wall whose contract could actually get moved and he could play again if he was able to waive a portion of his current contract."
"Yeah, a typo makes me look like I don't know what I'm talking about while you're sitting here telling us that Anthony Davis is the second coming of Christ."
No I'm not joking that one of the pillars of basketball history is more important to basketball than Anthony Day to Davis.

Anthony Davis is one of the softest big men in NBA history. Constantly on the floor feigning an injury.
AD = Anthony Davis  ADP = All Day Peterson
Anthony Davis needs to return back his old form .
Man current lebron is already nice on the Lakers but prime kawhi’s defense with Anthony Davis would be scary and he’s not as ball dominate as lebron so it free up touches for Westbrook to flourish
"&gt; Anthony Davis. Yet to earn his spot.  This is ridiculous when there's old dudes with much much worse careers than AD on the list.  Earl Monroe on the list with 4 All-Star teams, 1 All-NBA team and 1 ring as a role player.  Dave Bing with 7 All-Stars, 3 All-NBA and never making it out of round 2  Billy Cunningham with 4 All-Stars and 4 All-NBA and 1 ring as a role player  Sam Jones with 5 All-Stars and 3 All-NBA who's only known because he won rings on Bill Russell's teams  Maravich with 5 All-Stars and 4 All-NBA and not a single playoff moment in his career  Reggie with 5 All-Stars and 3 All-NBA  Lenny Wilkens who never made an All-NBA team in his career !!!  None of those guys have any case over AD who has 8 All-Stars, 4 All-NBA teams (all first), 4 All-Defensive teams, and a ring as the co-MVP of the team."
"I honestly think this is not a flagrant foul, a good hard foul at the end of the day (just like the stupid commentator was saying). But again, bad timing, hard fouling when the game is decided is just a foolish play. Embiid is made of glass, he is no different than Anthony Davis for example, and you see him flailing around, crash landing for no reason, etc.. I would not want a guy like this to be the franchise player of my favorite team, luckily I am not that invested on the Lakers in recent years, lol every landing is a potential heart attack for the most dedicated fan, that's literally not fun or entertaining, it's just pure anxiety"
"He was facing off against Anthony Davis, right? I think anyone would have trouble against him (as much as he is made fun of)"
"[Buha] After being down and writhing in pleasure for a solid minute, Anthony Davis just put his clothes back on and got up on his own. Seems to be walking off whatever happened."
"Lakers played Dwight/Jordan 32 minutes, Anthony Davis 34 minutes and Lebron 39 minutes.  How the hell did they give up 18 offensive rebounds and get out rebounded by 13 to the Grizzlies.  This allowed Memphis to shoot 16 more fgs than the lakers.  Also usually when a team shoots 53% from 3 and their opponents shoot 37% its a blowout."
"First time **ever** that LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Austin Reaves, and Anthony Davis have won a game together. We've all been waiting years for this moment"
"Really despise our propensity to play like shit in the 2nd half. 2/3 games now so far where we have really good first halves and follow it up with shit shows. Also despise Anthony Davis doing fucking nothing against weak interior opposition.   Tonight was a good win but two things to note: we're getting bullied inside both on the boards and point in the paint. Areas that were our strong suit the last two seasons. We traded smaller, more nimble players for athleticism and height and we're getting demolished. No excuse for it."
Anthony Davis at the 5 is a two-way beast.
"You’re just wrong, I don’t have the time and effort to find every thread, but off the top of my head:  Jeremy Lin is better than Russ Rose is better than Russ Poole is better than Russ Anthony Davis is not top 75 Anthony Davis should be held accountable for the lakers not winning   These were all threads people interacted in"
"Oh man, can you imagine a team having Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday, with Monty Williams as their head coach? Bare minimum that's a playoff team every year. I bet they wouldn't do anything stupid like trade for and sign Omer Asik to a massive contract."
Mikal bridges. When he was in college I called him the most disruptive defender I had seen since Anthony Davis and it’s the same in the NBA
I personally find Anthony day to Davis funny af
"Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan, and Dwight are the people you want to talk to about that.  To be fair, Holmes used to feast on us in the interior and that's one reason we acquired him."
"Bullshit. Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, and Rajon Rondo are all on the active roster.  That right there is more star power than the entire Kings team, meanwhile we're missing Harrison Barnes and (much less importantly) Marvin Bagley."
"Somebody check Anthony Davis, maybe whatever makes him ""Day-to-Davis"" is contagious?"
"I know you aren’t literally asking but thought it would be fun to think about, Brook Lopez used to be able to have a night like that but I doubt it now, Giannis could do it if he has one of those nights where he he is hot from 3. Jokic isn’t a big block type of rim protector but maybe he could get up to 5 blks since he is always in the paint. Serge Ibaka if he can ever return to 2019-2020 form. Bubble Anthony Davis could do it but he can just make his jump shots this year. Finally have a feeling Mobley might have a night like that this year even.   If anyone else can think of more love to know."
May I introduce you to the Anthony Davis isolation special?
"[https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/\_/id/7690823/new-jersey-nets-acquire-forward-gerald-wallace-portland-trail-blazers](https://www.espn.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7690823/new-jersey-nets-acquire-forward-gerald-wallace-portland-trail-blazers)  The New Jersey Nets acquired forward Gerald Wallace from the Portland Trail Blazers in a deadline deal on Thursday in exchange for center Mehmet Okur, small forward Shawne Williams and New Jersey's protected 2012 first-round pick, the Nets announced. The pick is top-3 protected, according to a league source.      A team source told ESPN.com's Chad Ford the Nets were willing to part with their top-3 protected pick because there are only three players in the upcoming draft the Nets covet -- Kentucky's Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Kansas' Thomas Robinson.   ...     That pick was Damian Lillard ..."
"What  I'm a Kyrie anti and that's still disrespectful to Kyrie.  AD is soft as shit. He can't lead a team to win against the OKC Thunder and he's literally only been good in the bubble, where there were no scary fans to mess with his soft, soft feelings and not one of the other teams even wanted to be there.  No player had ever been as overrated as Anthony Davis, I swear to God."
"It's strange to me for 2 reasons.  One I think it is pretty common in the MLB (though I cannot find numbers for current no trade clauses) so the fact that there is none in the NBA strikes me as strange.  Two, teams' ability to trade players whenever they want is often the players' general response to player empowerment criticism.  It strikes me as strange that teams' lack of loyalty is often a source of complaint amongst players when they theoretically have some power to prevent such a thing.   There is also the scenario in which a player is forcing his way out of town.  Anthony Davis tried very hard to force his way to the Lakers and it eventually worked, but he could have guaranteed it if he had a no trade clause he would only waive to go to the Lakers.  Ben Simmons probably wouldn't mind one right now so he could stop any trades to unwanted teams."
"and he also had a lot worse team. now he has Anthony davis, the best player hes ever played with."
He also didn’t hve Anthony Davis any of those years
Yeah he also didn’t have anyone like Anthony Davis on the roster
He caught the flu from Anthony Davis
Imagine a team with Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis only favored by 1 against the Kings.
Fuck Anthony Davis
"Very unfortunate! However, nice that Anthony Davis gets more exposure as a perpetual #2 who is completely unworthy of the Top 75 list."
Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis
"The Lakers are not getting a lottery pick with Anthony Davis and Lebron James on the roster. They’re cruising for that play-in game range.  I know they’re having a tough year, Lebron is shooting too many jumpers, and AD is starting to decline, but the Lakers are not a lottery team. Everyone’s freaking out because they’re ~.500, not around .300 or .350"
"&gt;What the Lakers need is to tell Anthony Davis that they need him to be that center.   He has been. So far, only ~30% of his minutes are next to either Dwight or DJ."
"What the Lakers need is to tell Anthony Davis that they need him to be that center.   They need to look at the Heat with Bam, Butler and Lowry and be like AD, James and Westbrook should be a better version of that.   I think that was the game plan but Trevor Ariza injury had stopped that lineup as I think he was going to play a PJ Tucker/Jae Crowder type of role."
"I, personally, am a fan of the Mavs first and players second (though I love plenty of players who aren't Mavs). My honest question is how do we improve with no cap space and a very limited selection of first round picks? The Mavs have repeatedly mortgaged the future for 2 decades. How long, in this era, does Luka put up with the team around him? While I won't assume we can't win with him... we don't want to get to a state where we see an Anthony Davis (limited his options by saying he wouldn't re-sign with other teams) or Ben Simmons situation."
Dude has a weird release yet he makes them. Unlikr Anthony Davis who has a more traditional shooting form but bricks them all. Fuck.
"Because you say you ""have never seen what what he can do without having an all star team around him."" Your own words. No player wins it all without any All-Stars on their team. It's to point out how dumb your statement is. That and Curry last year played pretty freaking amazing if you asked anyone who watched. How many teams had way more help than him last year? What numbers was he putting up on what efficiency?  I mention LeBron because he couldn't do it on his own, and he's a bigger, stronger, and more athletic player than Curry. He wouldn't win any rings without All-Stars on his team. Heat with Wade and Bosh, and then Ray Allen, Cleveland with Love and Irving. Now Lakers with Anthony Davis, Westbrook, and Carmelo (a maybe).  Even Nowitzki had Jason Kidd, Tyson Chandler, Shawn Marion, and Peja, but most were past their prime.  No one player is great enough to win it all without any All-Star support. Finals teams are just too good + all the champs have 2-3 solid offensive options. Stop being stupid with the ""we haven't seen what X can do without all-stars"" lmaos."
"Stop moving the goal post. First it was KD now we are arguing if he had a good team around him? Every champion has a good team around them. Lebron doesn’t have a championship without Wade, Kyrie or Anthony Davis."
"If you're trying to make the best possible team with a starter from each team in the division, then Pacific should be -   PG: De'Aaron Fox  SG: Devin Booker  SF: Paul George  PF: Draymond Green  C: Anthony Davis  And this team is better than any of the other teams"
Anthony Davis in the corner
Are you saying Kawhi would still be a Spur today if they extended him early?  Players choose to leave all the time. Anthony Davis got the extension and left.
"Anthony Davis should be no were near any All NBA team, most overated player i have seen in a long time. Please look at his stats and team record.....still crazy that he made the 75 team while having accomplished next to nothing outside of a bubble chip that he only got cuz he teamed up with LBJ"
Anthony Davis shouldn’t be a forward. Also COTY should be Monty or Wes Unseld  Also Mavs vs clippers ofc
I need Anthony Davis to have this mindset and killer instinct. Giannis goes out and plays every game like it’s his last. I love and respect him for that.

"You been watching these games? LeBron has arguably been the best defender on the team. Westbrook Albeit is just meh at defense right now but he's not playing anything abysmal, he can stay in front of his man, and isnt great at off ball defense. So I'd say he's playing average defense. The biggest problem with the Lakers defense, as opposed to last year, is the loss of KCP and Alex Caruso. As well as Kuz and Morris who were good defenders as well. Theyre getting destroyed on the perimeter and have dropped considerably in paint defense in part because Anthony Davis hasn't been as dominant as usual at that end, but he's also like second in the league in blocks so there's that. Of the big three of the Lakers the one underperforming the most right now is AD."
"Possible and probable are two different things. Surround Jokic with   Lonzo   Jrue   Mikal  Draymond   and they’ll easily have a great/elite defense in the playoffs. Will it be perfect? No. Will they maybe have to do a lot of scrambling and play frantically? Sure. But they’ll be more than enough to win a chip.   Is that team easy to assemble? Nah, but neither were the 2017 Warriors or the 2021 Nets. Teams can get stacked with talent in the blink of an eye. And it doesn’t even have to be those exact players. Swap Dray with Anthony Davis and swap Mikal with Harrison Barnes. Still good enough? Yep. Swap Jrue with old Lowry? Still good enough? I think so.   And there’s gonna be emerging two way role players as time goes on. Jokic is young. He could move teams in a couple years and team up with some guys who aren’t even known as two-way players rn"
"You're taking it the wrong way, nobody is against the Rockets on this side of the issue (well, except maybe John Wall lol). The problem is the league moving goalposts all the time while saying it's under the guise of ""preservation of the integrity of the game"". Even if they're right (in principle), the way they're handling it is more consistent with the reasons of loss of revenue/ fan attendance  From [NBA Denies Threatening Pelicans with Fines for Benching Anthony Davis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/sports/nba-anthony-davis-fines.html)      This season, though, several players with smaller profiles than Davis have been shelved by their teams in anticipation of a trade without any public pushback from the N.B.A.          Like Davis, Chandler Parsons of Memphis and Carmelo Anthony, the former Houston Rocket, wanted to play but were benched for months.  I mean yeah, I get it, we don't care about Wall. If it's a healthy Lebron we're talking about though, you bet that's gonna be a different story."
"I know, but we shouldn't be struggling to beat lottery teams when we have Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook.   Hell, even with Bron we struggle against them lol."
"Lakers got outrebounded in both offensive and defensive rebounds. In a game with Anthony Davis, Deandre Jordan, LeBron, Westbrook, the guy with the most rebounds is Cade Cunningham."
"Lakers got outrebounded in both offensive and defensive rebounds. In a game with Anthony Davis, Deandre Jordan, LeBron, Westbrook, the guy with the most rebounds is Cade Cunningham."
Yeah for carrying I can’t handle a double Anthony Davis
Everyone talks about Dwight Howard being a clear snub from the top 75. But Draymond Green also deserved to be there. Both guys deserved it clearly over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.
Anthony Davis is basically Mr. Glass
"a team with lebron james, anthony davis, and russell westbrook just scored 23 points against the worst team in basketball...  what's even weirder is that the pistons shot 39% from the field while the lakers shot 49% and they're only up 2 wtf is going on lol"
"I just want to know what happened to Anthony Davis these past 2 seasons. He looks like a complete zombie, and I’ve been saying this since January.  Is he legitimately hurt? Something wrong with his form, shooting mechanics? What is going on? He is HORRENDOUS"
Kinda is when the other players include LeBron and Anthony Davis.
"I mean they weren't good last year either with that core, why are people just conveniently forgetting that? At the end of the day its dependent on LeBron and Anthony Davis to perform, and they did not against the Kings."
He’s averaging 24/10/3 with almost 4 stocks and mfer really said Anthony Davis
Mfs said anthony davis
"Good and bad is really subjective to expectations, I don't think any team would turn down an Anthony Davis if they could get one. But especially after LeBron and Russ said it was Anthony Davis' Team, you expect him to play like a top 10 player. When he doesn't he has been bad this season. It is no different than saying the same with Dame, Tatum, or Randle this season."
"Yes for a dude that is supposed to be a top 10, maybe a top 5 player he has been bad. Obviously he isnt playing bad If his expectations were that of a player like PJ Tucker, but for what Anthony Davis has been before and can be, he has been bad..."
Anthony Davis looks like garbage
"Anthony Davis this season:      16.7% on threes — worst in NBA history by any player with 2+ attempts per game and 20+ games played.      38.3% on midrange — worst in the NBA by any player with 100+ attempts.      33.1% on jumpshots — worst in the NBA by any player with 150+ attempts  &amp;#x200B;  What am I missing?  He should be attacking the rim or passing given the way he is shooting - why is that controversial or worth arguing with given those #'s?"
I will never forgive Lebron and Anthony Davis for this shit. Never.
"Anthony Davis is supposed to be a top 8 or so player in the league man, where is this guy?  Is he just coasting until it gets deeper in the season?"

Would you trade Anthony Davis (currently qualifies as center) for KAT?
"There's a lot of talk about Westbrook as a problem for the Lakers, but Anthony Davis' lack of efficiency in mid-range and 3-point shooting is quite a problem.  It's probably the biggest immediate problem for the Lakers to fix."
This speaks just a great deal of LeBron. He was so hung up of playing alongside the worst player in nba history. Wanted to set the difficulty sliders to :Anthony Davis.
"Anthony Davis  yelled out, “There you go! There you go!” Sharpshooter Carmelo Anthony gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Russell Westbrook  yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Garnett hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

Anthony Davis
So you're telling me Anthony Davis is the worst player of all-time?!??!?!
That's top 75 of all time Anthony Davis to you sir.
Anthony bum ass Davis needs to be blamed a lot more for how bad the lakers are.
Anthony Day-to-Davis and CP3-5 Weeks would make the All Injury Team for sure
Anthony Davis puts up empty box stats.
"What's more annoying is that there's a worse performing star on his team in Anthony Davis, but Russ is getting all the blame. Even though Davis is playing like garbage for the 2nd season in a row now."

Anthony Davis
"Well this was surprising.   [Anthony Davis made 1 of his 12 jumpers last night as Lakers lost to Kings.    Out of 56 players who have attempted at least 150 jumpers this season, he ranks last in efficiency, averaging just 0.71 points per shot. https://t.co/sJuHuwWKEC](https://twitter.com/kirkgoldsberry/status/1464638881677070351?t=i1wsThzBe8tDsAhKLojTMA&amp;s=19)"
"AI carried absolutely horrible teams to deep playoff runs. He did it as the only scoring option on the roster, playing 42+ mpg regularly. Anthony Davis couldn’t do anything on the Pelicans. The only time he truly looked like a top 5 player was when he was paired with Lebron, one of the best players of all time. Plus AI had longevity. Anthony Davis looks absolutely horrible this year, who knows how long his career will last."
"&gt; The suns were killed for being a “weak” western champ   No, they were killed for being gifted a pathetic route to the Finals:   \- Anthony Davis got injured and missed a chunk of the series + LeBron James was clearly nursing an injury as well  \- Jamal Murray misses the whole series  \- Kawhi Leonard misses the whole series  And before any of you idiots and/or Suns fans come at me with the ""b-b-b-but they didn't choose their opponents!"", don't. No shit they didn't choose it."
There’s no way you just said Anthony Davis is better than AI lmfao
"Everyone deserves some blame, but the biggest one is Anthony Davis.   People judge him and his stats compared to other bigs of prior eras and conclude (wrongfully) that he is on their level or even above them. Yet when they judge Curry, Lillard, Harden or any other guard, they know that the way the game changed in regards to officiating and overall composition of teams inflates their scoring quite a bit. You can see this overinflation of modern bigs when the likes of Bynum and Roy Hibbert were considered ""good"".  Basically, Davis is not as good as people think he is, even rabid Laker fans know this deep down no matter how ferociously they will downvote any criticism of him. His stats are somewhat comparative to Hakeem's, but it would be criminal to assume that AD is even near his level."
"People act like Anthony Davis was only good in the bubble. He's been an All NBA player, one of the top defenders in the league by a big margin. The way Reddit talks about him makes him seem like a bum, lol.   He definitely got hot in the right 3 week stretch 2 years ago, but he's been an amazing player for his whole career. He's just been a pretty average shooter, and this year he's been BAD."
"Curry didn’t have russel Westbrook and Anthony Davis last year, both who are good enough to get teams worse than the lakers to the playoffs"
"I've been watching basketball for about 30 years, and I'm a bit sick of hearing that KG would be best at anything if he was playing today. Honestly, he's on the same level as Anthony Davis. Couldn't do shit with his original team, even though he did have a few all-stars during his time there. Then he joined other hall of famers and won a title, and now he's a top 10 of all time, or whatever ridiculous rating he's given on these boards..  Compare that to any of the players on the list - these are all players carrying their teams. First round exits by player:  Curry: 1  LBJ: 1  Jokic: 0  Giannis: 3  Kevin Durant: 1  So he's basically had more first round exits in a row than the rest of the players we're comparing him to had combined for the career.  Oh, and about the help: Cassel and Sczerbiak both made all-star, and he also had some solid role players in Billups, Laphonso Ellis, Marbury, Terrell Brandon, Gugliota, Laettner, Isaiah Rider etc.  For comparison, Jokic had 0 all-stars playing next to him, and hasn't had a first round exit to date."
"&gt; Say it with me everyone - stop shooting 3 pointers, Anthony Davis. Just stop it.  I love when people on here were saying he's a 7' wing like he'd be in the league if he was 6'5''."

Damn if only that team had a former MVP and a prime Anthony Davis to fall back on...   wait a minute
Anthony Davis is the real Russell Westbrook
Anthony Davis is 28 years old.
Anthony “9-22 FG” Davis
"Gobert is one of the best help defenders but Anthony Davis is better on perimeter (if y’all remember he stifled jimmy butler in game 4 on one on one). Those are facts but if gobert had solid (not that they’re bad now, but I mean really good at defense) defenders on the wings then he might be able to focus more on offense instead of making sure the team doesn’t fall behind."
Im not even trying  -me when im 8 but also Anthony Davis
Wouldn’t it be crazy if the sixers pivoted and traded embiid for Anthony Davis and kept Ben Simmons?  I know I’m gonna be downvoted to shit but honestly I’m not sold on Embiid leading a title contender. Too oft injured. I don’t even know if that would appease Simmons but just a thought. Sixers with Simmons and Davis work much better imo. I don’t see why the Lakers would be against it. But go ahead everyone tear me to pieces.
"I feel like these Anthony Davis stats are all over the place. Some are used to defend him ie the 30 pt games, others to make him look bad like this one.  What is the truth???"
"Looking back at this play now, it's wild that down 1, we ran a play to get a three off a curl for our 6'11 big man. Kinda explains a lot about anthony davis now.   like analytics go out the window here, because we only need 2 to win so you just optimize for the easiest shot."
"Ya. Back when they didn't just look at the scoreboard and say ""eh. We're up by 10 i guess we can take it easy"". I'm not saying this team is bad. It's fucking lebron James. Anthony Davis and Russel Westbrook. There's a reason everyone thought that they're locked for the finals. They just don't play like they wanna be in the finals. The moment they see that they have a lead. They just start relaxing till they're down again."
They are going to have to be really pragmatic. It's clear LeBron at his best is still a world beater. we saw that against the Pacers. But he can't be that type of LeBron everynight. He's 37. They are going to have to do a lot of load management for him to have fresh legs for the playoffs. Unfortunately the team is just not good enough for him to take nights off. Anthony Davis just has no excuse to be settling for jumpers right. He's 28 and doesn't have anywhere near lebrons mileage. Ideally he would step up to the plate  so LeBron could rest but I'm just not seeing it. In theory Westbrook was honestly not a bad idea for this team. But they sacrificed some good defensive pieces and basically killed their spacing. Westbrook has always been like this so I straight up do not even blame him. You know what you get with him on your team.
Anthony Davis being a bitch and refusing to play at the 5 cost this team whatever shot they had
While also playing alongside Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook lmao what a time to be alive.
"Hes one of the best 2nd options if not the best 2nd option we have in the nba (if you even consider Anthony Davis a 2nd option player when most would say hes a top 5 player in the league right now). When it came down to it in the Finals, he was a gigantic reason they won that series.  He obviously has tried and failed to be a leader and a first option but to discount his ability and say he's not even top 20 is absolutely foolish (Kevin Durant also tried and failed to be a first option for years before he joined the Warriors and won thanks to the leadership of Draymond and Curry). The difference between Kyrie and no Kyrie for that Cavs team was literally a championship (they could have beat the Warriors the year before as well if Kyrie wasnt injured), so your take that Kyrie doesn't make a team better or impact the game is ridiculous.  At best he is a fringe top 10 player, but I think for sure he is top 15. And I don't know about saying Dame is better than him. Dame has never made the finals as a first option and he has been outmatched in every way in a number of series. And its also hard to say that he could be a good enough second option like Kyrie also."
Felt this. Every time Anthony Davis hits the floor I get nervous
Adding Anthony Davis was seen as the reason for that improvement plus a healthy LeBron. Having a ton of talent on your team is basically a death sentence for COTY chances because people will just credit those guys instead of your coaching
"The results speak for how good the team is *with* its superstar.  Between ""went from Steph, Klay, and Draymond to Harden and Kyrie"" and ""went from Wade/Bosh to Kyrie/Love to Anthony Davis"" and ""Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson's casts,"" the superteam metric in this thread is how good the *rest* of the team is.  The Warriors aren't a superteam to KD because they won 2 of 3 with KD, but because KD joined a team that fit him perfectly *and* was a title contender without him.  So the question has to be, what was the quality of the *rest* of the Celtics cast, either compared to modern superteams, or compared to the league at the time?  (Keeping in mind that the team in 1958 looked quite different from the team in 1968.)  Which is why I say it's a tricky question to answer."
"I respect the effort that went into your list, but it still lacks the essential information to make any of these judgements.  Contract information cannot be ignored.  For example, that Anthony Davis trade seems okay, until you remember that the Lakers traded that enormous pile of players and picks for just one season of pending-UFA Davis.  And when you also realize that they paid 10 times as much for one season of Davis as Brooklyn just paid for 1.75 seasons of Harden, it looks even worse.  That was a massive overpayment of literally a decade of assets for one season, and it's tough to call that a win, as a result."
"&gt;Who wins?  The Lakers sure as hell lost that one.  Gasol and Odom were never the same.  New Orleans still got Anthony Davis in the subsequent draft, though, after remaining bad enough to have pretty decent lottery odds -- which may have been rigged anyway."
"Do they have a salary cap in european soccer? I don't watch it but I know that the big teams get the talent from the small market teams so yeah it's a risk but we already have that problem in the NBA.  Durant, Anthony Davis, LeBron, Kemba and Westbrook all left their teams for bigger markets/better teams so it's not like the small market teams are being protected.  My idea is that rookies are going to want to go somewhere they can get real playing time AND get paid.  Could add some stipulations about if you are over the luxury tax or over a certain amount of payroll you can only offer X amount of money to a rookie.    Plus the Knicks haven't gotten a star to go there for years so why would this change anything, players want to go places they can win, the money will come to you no matter where you live."
"At the time, Dragic was just 24 years old, and had barely started a game yet.  No one knew he'd wind up being arguably the centerpiece of that trade.  But the other three were all good players, too.  New Orleans would've been way too good to ever draft Anthony Davis, though."
He went to Anthony Davis and also tried his hardest to get Kawhi on the team too. These arguments aren't logical. The same people hating KD in this thread will justify LeBron of their favorite guy doing the exact same thing.
"I'm just trying to understand why in your scenario LeBron takes $60MM but yet: ""Anthony Davis probably gets offered that from other teams, but let's theoretically say he signs with the Lakers for $40M a year."""
Yeah until you realize kawhi won a ring in the east and then went to the west when lebron was in the West with Anthony Davis lol  You bron stans have some serious tunnel vision to convince yourselves of shit
"I’ll give you that, LeBron had Wade and Bosh in Miami and Irving and Love in Cleveland. Now he has Anthony Davis. And Jordan had Pippen and Rodman, and Kobe had Shaq and later Gasol. You’re not wrong.  But Kevin Durant’s team almost beat the warriors. They had Westbrook. So he leaves a franchise that loves him and that could have won a championship for the easy way out with the team that beat him. That doesn’t make it sound any better.  And separately, Davis is talented but overrated, not a top five player in the league. I’d give him top ten maybe."
"It would spread out the stars more.  Let's say everyone starts fresh with no contracts.  $100M hard cap, no max.  Lakers and Pacers both offer LeBron $60M.  He chooses Lakers clearly, they still have that advantage.  Giannis gets the next bids.  Lakers offer $30M, Bucks offer $60M, and Pacers offer $60M.  He chooses the Bucks.  Anthony Davis up next.  Lakers and Bucks both offer $30M, but the Pacers are offering $60M.  He goes for the Pacers.  KD and Harden still want to team up.  Nets offer them both $40M each over 4 years, the most they can do to still fill out their roster.  But Detroit is offering each $60M for 4 years separately.  Do they both turn down a guaranteed $80 million dollars?  Doubt it."
"&gt; Wait until the Lakers 12th man is better than every small market teams second or third option.  IMO it would be much less likely to happen without max contracts and with a hard cap.  It would spread out the stars more.  LeBron probably could have gotten at least $60M a year from the Lakers.  Anthony Davis probably gets offered that from other teams, but let's theoretically say he signs with the Lakers for $40M a year.  The Lakers now have only $20M to spend on 13 other players, so about $1.5M each."
"&gt; I understand that. But you never seen any of them signing for less now do you? It’s also a status thing. I’m #1 and I should be paid as such.   Yes, all the time. Anthony davis turned down a supermax contract to go play in LA just last year.  In fact the supermax is a great example of how it doesn't work. It was specifically designed to make it more lucrative for players to stay in the market that drafted him, which would by extension help small market teams keep the stars that they drafted.   It hasn't worked that well.  * Kawhi forced his way out of San Antonio even though he was eligible for the supermax * Paul george forced his way out of indiana even though he was eligible  for it"
Better than LeFraud and Anthony Day-to-davis
"This was a stupid narrative to begin with, not a single all-time great has won a championship without another HoFer, aside from Hakeem Olajuwon.  LeBron won his first two rings with D-Wade and Chris Bosh, both of whom were All-NBA, perennial All-Stars and future HoFers, Wade had also already won a championship and a Finals MVP. LeBron's most impressive ring was also won with two perennial All-Stars and future HoFers (i'm assuming Kyrie will continue playing and eventually make it) and his last ring was with Anthony freaking Davis, an all-time great talent/future HoFer.  Yeah, KD assembled the most talented team ever, so? Every superstar is trying to stack their team, ask LeBron if he would've refused Kawhi for ""competitive balance"" in 2019.  You can say his ring has less value than, let's say Dirk's 2011 championship, but i can turnaround and make the same argument for LeBron's first two championships. At the end of the day he won, if he had lost then it would've been a different story. In the words of MJ: ""73-9 means nothing without a ring"" they won a bunch of regular season games only to be down 3-1 in the WCF and then to choke a 3-1 lead themselves without KD.  If KD wins his third ring and Finals MVP with this team and beats LeBron in a Final for the third time, you will have a hard time leaving him out of the Top 10, especially considering that all of his rings would've been against a Mount Rushmore player. He had a squad, but let's not act like LeBron was playing with a bunch of guys from the streets in 2017, that Cavs team was insanely good."
"Literally every player is for sale as long as the price is right. For some players though, it’s just impossible for another team to put together a package to meet that price.   Like, Embiid is firmly “not for sale,” but if a team put together a package of Giannis + Anthony Davis, then Embiid would be on the next plane to Milwaukee. Realistically though, nobody is ever going to offer a package like that, so he remains out of trade discussions."
You think Zion Williamson would have signed with the Lakers for the MLE to back up Anthony Davis for 10 minutes a night?
Anthony Davis is scared of the Brooklyn Nets. Kevin Durant has a history of destroying LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the playoffs.   Nets in 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers.
Anthony Davis is a top player and a top MVP candidate on his own right
"The Nets win for now as they got another superstar to add to their team in the biggest win-now move since the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis, but it could all go fucking tits up real quick if they don't win by 2022 which causes KD &amp; Harden to opt-out and dip outta town  Rockets aren't really gonna win with that twat of an owner they got, but if shit hits the fan in Brooklyn they are well-poised for some Outsourced Tanking 2.0"
You don't cruise to a title against LeBron and Anthony Davis
"At the same time Harden showed up out of shape, skipped camp, bitched and moaned and was likely going to become more and more of a cancer in the locker room until he got traded. Harden made it so the team didn't have a choice after he chose to stay there  Anthony Davis leaked that he'd only sign with LA which drove down his trade value.   I'm not saying players don't generate millions, but players buy into this media ""i need to win a title"" thing or that they need to go to a place to enhance their brand and demanding trades to specific places because you feel like it when you are being paid to be THE guy is dangerous for the league.   You can't just suspend them obviously otherwise you'd have a few owners finding ways to completely undercut the llayer but the league should try to figure something out"
"Lmao what? You think a team of Lebron, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Dion Waiters, Danny Green, Kuzma, Caruso isnt a great team? Thats legit a super team lmao what the fuck do you want on your team 8 superstars?"
Ya'll gonna put some respek on Anthony Davis' name. He's a handful all by himself. Sheesh
"Whatever he does after they're done is revisionist history.  Wade and bosh and love and kyrie were elite options before the superteams. Ofc lebron is the second best of all time rn, he's gonna be the engine that makes it work. But those players were all highly recognized before he joined.  And using your logic, lebron cried to LA after losing 3/4 to the dubs and couldn't even make the playoffs in his first year. Then he cried to Anthony Davis to carry him in the playoffs. Note I don't care about this I'm just using your logic"
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"New Orleans got more for 1 season of Anthony Davis, too."
"Anthony Davis, 2020"
"Damn man, poor Lebron. He’s got to go against another ridiculous super team when all he did was team up with Anthony Davis. Shame that he’s always so underpowered"
"Dude have you watched BKN? DeAndre Jordan will have to defend Embiid, Bam and Giannis, Anthony Davis. Kyrie is still MIA and has a history of injuries. If one of these guys goes down in the playoffs with no depth BKN is in serious trouble."
"Let's not get this twisted, Houston Rockets are the winners here without a doubt. 8 draft picks, AND Vixtor Oladipo. Please understand, Kevin Durant is dropping 30 points every playoff game, but Unless he becomes a huge defensive threat, this team seems destined to come up short. Yes they can score at will. Yes they can probably shoot you to death, but they just traded away the man who glued their defense together, Jarret Allen. That man never had a silent game, he is so Rudy Gobert-like in the sense that even without him reaching for it he affects shots. AND HE'S ONLY 22! The Nets are laying down all their hopes on how well DeAndre Jordan and KD can defend the paint. KD will of course be playing the 4 or the 3 most of the time.  You're betting all your money that DeAndre Jordan is going to defend Embiid, Giannis, Bam and the Boston forwards. Back to back to back, then go on to defend against Anthony Davis.  People, DJ was outstanding in LA, but now they're asking him to be DPOY over all these other great and young bigs.  Unless more changes are coming, this just seems like a great 2021 regular season team! They'd have to sell kyrie just to afford more salary space!  TLDR: Houston Rockets are the winners of the trade and could potentially be favorites over Brooklyn next season."
We should rank those sets of teammates:  Steph/klay/dray  Wade/bosh  Harden/kyrie  Kyrie/love  Anthony Davis is alone so idk why you mentioned him
I will never understand that acronym. It’s like if you called Anthony Davis ADV.
Lebron went from Wade/Bosh to Kyrie/Love to Anthony Davis and every team had great depth and role players too(outside of year 1 Miami). This shit has to stop.
Horrible deal for Brooklyn. Gave up way too much including any chance of inside defense. Good luck vs Anthony davis.
Anthony davis...
Bro Lebron is playing with Anthony Fucking Davis
Did superstar Anthony Davis call his team mates bums when he wanted to get traded? Sorry but the guy you’re riding is an asshole
"If Durant wants to go, his return would be close to Paul George, Anthony Davis or any Harden trade."
I found Anthony Davis' burner account
Anthony Davis is overall a better defender and impacts the game more through his defense.  The defensive plays and stops he has are amazing.
The Allen/Pierce/Garnett Big 3 was way more balanced skill-wise on both sides of the ball than a Kyrie/Harden/KD Big 3 would be. I don't know how anyone can't see the problems waiting to arise. I don't see any of those three accepting the Klay Thompson role. Kyrie and Harden will have many bad defensive nights. And they still have nothing down low to counter Anthony Davis. Basketball is not always as simple as who has more stars like you think or the Lakers would've beat the Pistons in 2004. Plus the 2010 Celtics lost to a two star Laker team.
"&gt; Shai is a better playmaker than PG.  Of course he is, but PG is also a wayyyyy better shooter and defender than Shai is. Also, Kawhi wants to win *now*, he doesn't give a shit about a younger player developing and doesn't have the patience to wait around for that, none of these superstars do. Brandon Ingram is a much better playmaker and he's a better #1 option and offensive player than Anthony Davis, that doesn't mean that LeBron wanted to wait around for him to develop.   &gt; George is better, much better, than both, but he's not such a good player he's better than both combined lol.  He is and he isn't, because he's such an inconsistent player. Peak PG is absolutely good enough that he's better than both, however he does have low lows where he's not. He's such a confounding and frustrating player for that reason.   &gt; What Clippers are missing right now is a playmaker  Yes, that's true, but it's not like you can't get that player whilst already having Kawhi + PG. The Clippers failed to adequately surround Kawhi + PG with the necessary pieces in order to win, namely at point guard and at center. They fixed their hole at center with Ibaka, however they didn't fill their point guard hole, although Batum has helped them significantly in that regard so far as an Iguodala-ish playmaking wing.  &gt; past accolades  PG just had his peak year right before the Clippers traded for him..."
"&gt;	Lol well aren’t u just the know it all. So you know how I viewed ad before his stint with the Lakers huh? You’re so condescending and you don’t even realize it.  Jfc, dude you literally said:  “Then lebron trades for Anthony Davis a top 3-5 player”  So yes, I know how you viewed AD.... because you literally told us how you viewed him.   &gt;	Ben Taylor said an argument could be made that ad was the best player in the league even before his lakers stint.  Lmao I love this. You spent the last couple of comments saying, “Once again you are focusing on what other ppl think and what their perceptions were while i am focusing on what was actually true.” And yet here you are, trying to tell me what someone else thought of AD and using it to justify your reasoning.   You said all that but didn’t bother answering my simple questions of who else is in the top 5 besides AD."
"This makes sense to me, pretty bad of doing it, like maybe worse than anthony davis forcing his way out"
The same Woj that gleefully reported that the Pelicans were laughing at the Lakers' offer of young players and picks for Anthony Davis last off-season before the deal went through anyway? That Woj has all your trust?
"&gt;Why? Why specifically past the first round?  Past the first round is when you start playing the real contenders not teams like Orlando.   &gt;Green &gt; Tucker as a starter if we trade for Harden  Not really, just wait till Danny Green's shooting starts regressing a little before saying that. They had to put Anthony Davis on Jimmy Butler in the Finals last year because Danny couldnt guard him at all."
"&gt;	Then lebron trades for Anthony Davis a top 3-5 player and now they have insane depth  This is revisionist history. Immediately after the trade, everyone was saying the lakers traded so much for a player that is borderline top 10 because “he couldn’t do anything on the Pelicans”. Then as soon as they won the chip, everyone switched to “well what did you expect, they have two top 5 players”."
"He probably is the [greatest lob receiver](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/1/5/21049574/lakers-anthony-davis-catching-lobs-lebron-james-danny-green-pass-frank-vogel-video-gum-pelicans) of all time, it’s incredibly rare to have his size, athleticism, and feel for finished lobs at the rim. Also, I didn’t say anything about scoring, I said he’s a way better complimentary star to someone like Lebron or Harden because more of his value comes with the ball out his hands compared to Jokic, who needs the ball in his hands to take full advantage of his passing ability."
"He has a partnership in an athletic company.      GOAT shooter with 6 rings showing anyone, ""Hey, you don't need to be like LeBron or Anthony Davis or Giannis to be a champion"" would explode sales on his nursing shoes."
How'd Lebron do without having another all star on his team?  Love and Kyrie are lesser talents each playing without complimentary talent in small markets prior to them all joining forces in Cleveland.  Chris Bosh had one year in Toronto with a winning record.  Anthony Davis made the playoffs twice in NOLA.
Lebron joined d wade who was top 3 and bosh who was top 20  Lebron kyrie and love was a superteam when they formed. Now ppl say no cause love underperformed. Fine that’s an argument  Then lebron trades for Anthony Davis a top 3-5 player and now they have insane depth  You tell me? Lebron has had absolutely stacked supporting casts ever since he first left Cleveland and he’s won rings since then. He’s doing what he’s supposed to do.
KD is who Anthony Davis thinks he is
"I don't think you can compare Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Ray Allen, Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, Mike Miller, Chris Andersen, James Jones an aging Rashard Lewis, and Mario Chalmers to Schroder, Wesley Matthews, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and an aging Marc Gasol.  You're looking at 4 possibly 5 hall of famers on that heat team.  Hell, this Lakers team might not even be better than last year's team."
"Because there are lots of players who genuinely don't give a fuck about what fans say and enjoy their 100+ million earnings. Kawhi, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, Harden, Anthony Davis (who went through actual hell with the pelicans) are all examples of this. There are really only a select few players that can't get off social media and filter out the noise; generational wealth and thick skin has a tendency to do that.  KD, Kyrie, Lebron at times, Wall, Jordan back in the day, are the exceptions, not the rule."
And literally has Anthony Fucking Davis as a team mate...
Anthony Davis FULFILLS his role as a defensive player PREVENTING brown from SCORING. Visible DISGUST
"Anthony Davis was 26 and said he would resign long term with the Lakers. Its not the same situation at all with Harden at his age and with his player option in the 3rd year. Harden is still incredibly valuable but it is not the same situation, at least based on the rumors of what the markets is."
Anthony Davis is really a Laker. Still blows me away
"Correct   However,   Anthony Davis is a power forward"
Ayton is not as good as Anthony Davis give me a break.
[ESPN] LeBron James' inability to do math is reportedly causing tension within the Lakers Organization. Anthony Davis and Alex Caruso amongst many to request a trade.
Lebron &gt; Worthy   Caruso &gt; Magic   Anthony Davis &gt; Kareem    Best Big 3 that’s for sure
"&gt; Maybe if it wasn’t lebron getting assists, but we know lebron makes very meaningful assists   Spoken like a true lebronstan. Can you direct me to the analysis or litterature that shows that Lebron's assist are somehow more valuable, than everyone elses? i don't think you can.  &gt; but the only drastic difference in their numbers is assists. They score and rebound at similar rates and effeciencys.   Except it isnt? Anthony Davis averaged 1,5 more rebounds per game last year, and 1,3 more offensive rebounds. He also averaged 1,8 blocks more, which is the difference between the best defensive centers in the league and a random guy of the bench.   He also had. more defensive and offensive win shares, which seems to negate this idea that Lebron is a so much better offensive player.      &gt;Chris Paul and Klay score very similarly but CP3 is much better as a playmaker. Same as Lebron and AD.   Hakeem Olajuwon and Chris Paul score very similarly,  but Hakeem is much better player, despite the fact that Chris Paul is a much better playmaker. You see how we can all make random comparisons that support whatever point we want?     &gt; Your comparisons are straight up ass. With AD and Lebron everything is similar offensively except lebron is miles better as a playmaker.       Like i mentioned you need to drop this idea, the stats just doesnt support AD being a much worse offensive player than Lebron, he is clearly a worse playmaker, but there is much more to offense than passing the ball. Just take every dominant center every, Kareem, Hakeem, Wilt."
Is Anthony Davis Jr playing today?  Hope AD gets to spend some more quality father son time with wood today
"I did the research and you are the one with questions. I have the answers. What are yours?   Did Blake Griffin or Anthony Davis fill in for a starter? That would be my first question to you.  edit: Demar DeRozen and Kyle Lowry deserved it more, too."
Understood. I was prepared for a response like this.   How would you defend the fact that the following players deserved it more than Goran:   * Blake Griffin * D.J. Augustin * Isaiah Thomas * DeAndre Jordan * Lance Stephenson * Anthony Davis * Gerald Green   This isn't a post about Reggie. It is about the fucked up nature of the MIP award and specifically the 2013/14 season.
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat...*
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"&gt;Look, I can explain it you, but I can't understand it for you.  So what, exactly, are you claiming?  That Boston cannot hope to compete with Indianapolis as a free agent destination.  And that Butler -- who was fine playing in Minneapolis -- also was well beyond the reach of the poor Celtics.  And, [the Celtics were on Davis' list of desired trade destinations.](https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2019/02/16/boston-celtics-anthony-davis-list-desired-trade-destinations/)  They were also [the Pelican's preferred trade partner.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/06/07/rumor-new-orleans-likely-to-trade-anthony-davis-to-celtics/)  Ainge simply blinked.  And the Lakers won."
"&gt;They chose those teams as free agents.   Now you're whining because Boston cannot compete with Indianapolis as a free agent destination?  &gt;Even if they'd wanted to play for the Celtics, Boston would have needed to send out equivalent salary in order to aqcuire them.  In other words, ""How a trade works"".  &gt; His dad literally came out and trashed Boston in the press, guy.   Well the man obviously has taste, but that's not saying he's committed to Los Angeles long-term.  Nor is that necessarily Anthony Davis' opinion on the matter.  If you think Davis would've bailed on Boston after they traded for him, and if they won a ring in his first season, you must think Boston really sucks.  &gt; Oh, and he was signed with Klutch.   Yeah, and that other Klutch client is 36 years old.  Tatum and Brown and Irving and Walker are not.  Until a couple months ago, many people thought the Lakers were headed for an early playoff exit, exactly because they were relying on a guy at an age where almost no one had ever been effective in the playoffs.  All that said, everyone on r/nba says that trading the haul the Lakers gave up for Davis was worth one ring, even if he did walk.  I disagree with that completely for the Lakers, but it's not as though Boston has won a bunch lately, so conventional wisdom says that you don't pass up a chance at even one ring -- and then take your chances in free agency."

"Yeah, absolutely.  It's just disgusting how  small time stars in Lebron James and Anthony Davis are slept on in such a small market like LA."
"Tf you mean used him right the dude is a pylon on defence, heaves up shitty threes constantly and couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. Dude doesn't even rebound well and the ball stops with him like he's Anthony Davis or something.   He's played like garbage, doesn't matter how we use the garbage we can't change what it is."
Anthony Day-to-Davis is the best
"&gt;Many pundits feel that he could turn out to be an even better pro than Anthony Davis. Wiggins was the unanimous choice for the # 1 spot this year and for good reason. He possesses the special athleticism that separates very good players from great players. To round out his athleticism, he has matured and become more assertive and his refined skill package is a result of that. His jump shot from deep and in the midrange departments have greatly increased and he is more aggressive than he’s ever been. His handle, speed off the dribble and ability to get to the rim are ""Kobe-esque"". There were times this Spring when he simply looked like a man amongst boys. The alarming thing about it is that he still has a long way to go to become the type of player he is capable of. He is a special talent and has unlimited potential. If he continues to stay hungry and work to improve, we’re looking at the game’s next superstar.  -Ian Powers 6/29/12"
"You might want to ask this question on a college basketball sub because it's hard for NBA enthusiasts to separate out NBA performance from pre-draft assessments, especially going back up to 8 years. Also, and this definitely applies to me, I don't follow enough draft coverage to remember who the consensus #1 picks were in the past let alone their relative value to one another. (Though I do recall Anthony Davis was very hyped coming out of Kentucky.)"
Regular seasons are fun but no way in hell they winning against Playoff Lebron + Anthony Davis and doubt theyll get past the other teams as well.
"While I'm at it, here's who I think for the West:  * Nikola Jokic * Paul George * CJ McCollum * LeBron James * Brandon Ingram * Mikal Bridges * Anthony Davis * DeMar DeRozan * James Harden * Luka Doncic * Steph Curry * Kawhi Leonard"
"I wanted to ask how you feel about trade rumors as a player. I know every player goes through this, but does it bother you ever? Current big names like Beal and Harden have sparked a lot of rumors lately. It seems to be detrimental to player mental health/on court play when rumors linger on, like say what happened pre Anthony Davis trade to the Lakers old core."
And no Anthony Davis
Who cares if they play the same game they have similar stats. Dude wanted to compare him to someone like Anthony Davis a guy who’s been to the playoffs 3 times
"Why compare him to Steph tho? Similar ish numbers with no context don’t mean much, Steph’s a point guard and you’re comparing him to a wing in terms of rebounding? He’s a wing who’s 6’9” obviously he’s gonna have more rebounds than a 6’3” PG who literally is the Warriors offense.  Let’s just compare Anthony Davis and Steph’s numbers at this point lol. I’m not disputing the quality and efficiency of PG, but why not compare him to another wing, where the stats are more relevant in comparison?"
Lol no. Anthony Davis is a generational talent. Tatum and Ingram are all-stars. There’s a difference.
Funny way to spell LeBron James and Anthony Davis (lmao)
"Well he has had three draft picks. The #4 draft pick was traded to acquire Anthony Davis. He bought a 2nd to get Talen Horton Tucker, and then he attached Danny Green to the 28th pick this year to acquire Dennis Schroeder"
Dinwiddie was a key piece for that. He was almost an all star and we need him without kyrie. It'd be like if the lakers were down Anthony davis and Dennis schroeder
ANTHONY DAVIS
Anthony Davis.
"Anthony Davis is Christian Wood lite, /s"
"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/30/897345063/nba-players-share-what-its-like-to-live-in-a-bubble  Has quotes from players saying it’s weird but nothing negative   https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/amp/anthony_davis_shares_why_playing_in_nba_bubble_is_easier/s1_127_32985674  Anthony Davis like it, there’s more but I’m sure you get the point.   And I could ask you the same question, who has reported that NBA players definitely don’t want another playoff bubble?  Lmao looks likes it’s not of end of discussion by your definition..."
Anthony fucking Davis heard y’all comparing Christian Wood to him.
I want to lick Anthony Davis' eyebrow.
When is wood going to change his name to Anthony Davis Jr
Anthony Davis gonna finish 25-25 for 52 pts
I love watching Anthony Davis play basketball
"Christian Wood 'circled' next two games vs. Anthony Davis, Lakers"
"""There’s a few games that I’ve circled on the calendar… and playing against [Anthony Davis] and the Lakers is definitely a game I circled. He’s a guy I’ve watched, with his moves. In my head, it’s going to be a fun matchup, and I’m going to go at him with everything I’ve got."""
and you still can. by looking at the screen and looking at the player.  did you get confused and think lebron james and anthony davis had been traded to the 76ers?
Man AD needs to wake up. It's been 20 games and he literally only had two or three good ones. LeBron putting 34 points with Anthony Davis on the same team should be a blow-out win.
"Of course they're the favourites lol, this will probably be meaningless anyways since Anthony Davis will likely go back to playing like a borderline MVP player instead of a mid-tier All-Star. The fact of the matter is that the team does look worse so far than they did last season beyond superficial record bullshit."
"The Lakers are 14-5, but only 6-5 against teams above .500 this season. Those 6 wins include four combined wins against a Morant and JJJ-less Grizzlies and the Spurs with no Aldridge, the Cavaliers on a back-to-back, and the one admittedly impressive win against Milwaukee. Their high O-Rating and D-Rating marks are result of blowouts vs. some of the worst teams in the league.  They have blown leads and been simply outplayed down the stretch by every contender they have played, from the Clippers on opening night to the Blazers and Warriors at home to tonight vs. the 76ers. Anthony Davis averages 17 points per game in their losses.  This is not a team that looks dominant at all, and they have very real offensive and rim protection issues."
I would simply not have my DPOY candidate chasing Anthony Davis around a screen
Anthony Davis is Javale McGee with a unibrow
Anthony Davis is choking man.
"Without KCP, Anthony Davis, or Schroeder contributing, Lakers are gonna lose."
Off topic but this clip really puts Embiid's size into perspective. Anthony Davis is 6'10/6'11 and while he's not built like Lebron he's pretty big in his own right. And Embiid just dwarfs him here. It's no wonder only guys like Gasol seem to have much success defending Embiid
Anthony Davis sells short on GME
Anthony Davis needs to be tougher.
Anthony Davis screams when he sees a spider
is anthony davis ok
Head to Head:  Anthony Davis	20.8	12.8	2.5	1.5	2.3  Joel Embiid	20.0	12.0	1.3	1.5	2.0  YIKES
"Only thing Joel Embiid is better than Anthony Davis is flopping.  And oh, also being day to day."
Omg Anthony Davis did the swing move. Should he also be castrated?
Anthony “Joel Embiid” Davis
Lmao a Danny Green Iso on Anthony Davis is not a good idea
Has Anthony Davis ever not grimaced during a nationally televised game tho?
Anthony Davis is a fucking Pussy
I don’t think Anthony Davis is hurt he’s scared; where u at ad?
lol so? is Anthony Davis some scrub now. I'm just showing how the super team secrets been out
"Why does Beal not get a pass but other NBA stars do?  Anthony Davis, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, etc.  All these guys demanded trades out of their organization.  It's quite obvious the Wizards have done little to put their team in a position to contend.  I mean John Wall comes back and they make a pretty lateral move to trade him for Russ.  If I was Beal, I'd be upset with the organization, and the Wizards should absolutely trade him before they lose him for nothing."
"Ahead of Luka Doncic, Zach LaVine, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis as a top 25 offensive player. Biased media never giving Lakers or ex-Lakers their fair shake. Sad!"
"&gt;If you haven't seen how much teams are either doubling Zion on the catch or having him see extra bodies at the rim then I'm not sure you've seen many Pelican games.  This is an oft-cited legend, but not accurate.  Here, for one example, is how the Lakers recently defended Williamson.  Anthony Davis did take him a few times, but mostly they led Montrezl Harrell and Markieff Morris guard him alone.  Morris did struggle to guard Williamson, but Markieff Morris is making minimum wage for a reason.  1st quarter  8:13 Top-Of-Key PNR for Williamson, no double, throws ball into crowd  7:50 TOK drive, blocked by Davis  5:37 elbow extended, single coverage by Davis, passed  2:44 Harrell primary on left block, Davis doubled after a few dribbles and blocked shot from behind  2:09 TOK, single coverage by Morris, layup for Williamson  0:28 left block, single coverage by Morris, Williamson loses ball, turnover  2nd quarter  11:41 Pseudo PNR at TOK, then single coverage by Morris, Williamson scores 5' shot  11:05 semi-fast break, Harrell and Morris converge to stop layup, makes pass to Hayes for layup  10:20 Morris single at FT line, James floats around in a soft-double, Williamson drive left, and misses layup  9:08 left block, single coverage by Morris, passes out  8:18 drives against single from Morris on left wing, scores from 5' and 1  7:50 brings ball up, drives into lane against Morris and James, TO  3:47 intial coverage by Caldwell-Pope on right block, double by Caruso, passed out  1:10 TOK PNR with Reddick, Davis stays on Williamson, passes  0:45 Dribble hand-off from Adams at FT line, drives on Gasol after switch, missed 5' shot  3rd quarter  11:26 right wing, single from Davis, drives into lane, questionably fouled by Gasol helping  10:10 brings ball up left wing, single from James, passes off  9:15 brings ball up center, drives on Davis, questionably fouled by Gasol  6:04 catches pass in middle of lane, goes up against Davis, missed from 6'  4th  11:14 left wing, covered by no one, drives for a layup and 1  10:49 brings ball up right side, single by James, passes off  10:16 TOK, PNR, Matthews switches, dribbles around him, Morris recovers and forces TO  9:17 brings ball up right side, drives on Harrell, misses 5' shot  8:34 right block, initial coverage by Morris, passes out as Harrell comes to double  7:10 catches ball in lane, bowls over Harrell, misses short shot, gets own rebound, makes layup  6:47 left block, versus Davis, drives, makes layup  4:36 catches at FT line, drives left on Harrell, misses 5' shot  \--"
 &gt;for just one season of Anthony Davis.  For one potential season. AD signed a new deal this off-season.
"&gt; but to deal Davis for less than what he’s worth  The Pelicans got Ingram, Ball, Hunter ( 3 top-4 overall picks! ), Hart, 2 firsts, and a first-round swap ( two of which are potentially post-James ) for just one season of Anthony Davis.  That was the most-expensive single season rental in NBA history, as far as I'm aware, so they definitely did not trade Davis for ""less than his value"".  Quite the opposite, they received a King's ransom, literally."
"I don't think Jokic is a lock by any means. He is easily one of the best players in the West, but his fan support is in no way in the LeBron, Luka &amp; Steph category.   Steph has had a few down years in terms of team releveancy, so he may not make the fan vote. Jokic will also be going up against Davis, Kawhi, PG, (possibly LeBron or Luka if they are listed as front court players). So far from a lock IMO.   FWIW, I think the West starters will be:   F1: Anthony Davis  F2: Nikola Jokic  F3: Kawhi Leonard  G1: LeBron James  G2: Luka Dončić   &amp;#x200B;  With Nikola and Kawhi's spots most up for grabs."
"On the court I saw him carry Tatum and brown as inefficient, inconsistent rookies in 2017-18 to a 41-16 record when everybody said that he’d fail. Everyone forgets that season because he got injured at the end of the year but he led the Celtics well that season. Without him they don’t get high seeding and they don’t make it to the conference finals.  He was shooting 49/41/88 that year too. Give him some credit  Right now he’s averaging 28/6/5 on 51/42/95... I saw people saying Anthony Davis was the 2nd best player in the league but he barely won as a first option"
LeBron as Sting  Curry/Klay as the Young Bucks  Kawhi as Orange Cassidy  Luka as Darby Allin  Chris Paul as Cody Rhodes   Anthony Davis as Kenny Omega  Gordon Hayward as Chris Jericho  Westbrook as Jon Moxley

"Quite honestly, he never had a coach or personnel around him to make it work. Same with Anthony Davis.  You look at Harden right now on this Nets team. Even if they have talent and even if they do well, its clear that their team does not have personnel or a scheme designed with Harden in mind. Houston was able to surround Harden with, worse players than KD to be sure, but players that allowed us to utilize him to his strengths on both sides of the ball.  Demarcus never had anything like that."
"Fair enough. Maybe his college career would get him in but I stand by what I said. If he hadn’t have been on those warriors championship teams idt he’d make it regardless of his college career. Most american nba players that went through college for multiple years like draymond end up leaving with a bunch of awards.  Chris Mullin was a beast in the nba. His nba numbers were wayyyy better than draymonds. I’m not too familiar with Calvin Murphy so I can’t really say anything for him.   The gold medalist helps a little obviously but really a USA gold medal in basketball is almost expected lol Not to mention he  only averaged 2ppg, 2rpg and 1.3 apg in his Olympics run.   I’m not trying to hate on Draymond. I think he is a bit annoying personality-wise but I enjoy watching his game in action. Plays hard and has a pretty unique skill set. But when I’m going through my list of current nba players that I think are destined to be in the Basketball HoF undeniably..... draymond is the weakest of links lol  Lebron , KD, Harden, Steph, Westbrook, Giannis, CP3, Klay, Kawhi, Anthony Davis......Draymond?"
This Anthony Davis guy has a lot of potential
"Utter domination of a first half. Anthony Davis started out very strong, dropping I believe 26 in the first half, the Bulls had no answer for him. Once again, we go up 30, but once again we get very complacent, causing the Bulls to come back down 14 at some point. That’s the only negative I have with this game, we need to stop being complacent when we’re up 20 in the second quarter. We remember what happened in Golden State. LeBron also had a great game.  Starting in the third quarter, the Bulls only mission was to make the loss respectable, and they accomplished their mission. They were never going to win the game.  At least Los Angeles won. Have a great evening everyone!"
"I will die by this hill, he did not get enough trading away Anthony freaking Davis."
"In fairness, Anthony Davis in his second season was much better/more complete than Zion is right now. Ingram's playing at an all star level again and those efforts are being wasted"
You guys should trade BI and Zion for a dominant two way big.... maybe someone like Anthony Davis?    :D
"I just dont see how they're going to win a series against Anthony Davis, especially when they also have to worry about LeBron fucking James."
And to think haters like Anthony Davis were calling him trash as recently as yesterday
I want Anthony Davis to put a baby in me.

"&gt; Ibaka has a good playoff history  Sure, back in his prime, but he's not in his prime anymore. If you look at his most recent playoff appearance he was played off the floor against Boston and now he's a year older. Here's why I don't think the Clippers offseason was that great, the way the OP above was saying it was: the Clippers still have the same problem this year that they did last year, in that if Ibaka isn't up to the challenge the way Trez wasn't last year, they have no other option. At least last year the Clippers could theoretically turn to JaMychal Green at center, but he's gone too, replaced with another wing.   Ibaka might be slightly better against Jokic or AD than Trez would have been, but he's primed to still get cooked by both, and if that happens, then what? Last year Boston played Ibaka off the floor with Daniel fucking Theis at center, but you're counting on him to hang with Anthony Davis? Answer me this: if Ibaka can't contain AD, what else can the Clippers do? I don't see Batum, Morris or Kawhi being able to guard him instead.   Batum has been a productive signing for the Clippers, but he's redundant because he's just another wing. The Clippers needed more frontcourt help, and while they did get Ibaka, they lost Green and Trez along the way. They're thinner now at center than they were last year, and you guys are acting like Ibaka is simply the answer. Again, go look at what happened to him last year against Boston and tell me how he's the solution there."
The dunk on Anthony Davis in crutches
"In the East the clear favorite is Joel Embiid. The 76ers have the best record in the East, he's making a legit case for being the DPOTY, and without him the 76ers just look bad. Also, stat wise he has them.  In the West it's LeBron James. It's the same old story with LeBron the only difference is that he's playing some good defense this year which helps his case. Also, the Lakers have the best record in the NBA.  So, who's the current MVP front runner? Well, it's LeBron. Best record, playing great both on offense and defense, and with Anthony Davis being quite lackluster by his standards, Lebron is carrying this Lakers team this year. Also, LeBron's impact is proven time and time again."
This is the problem with looking just at numbers.  Watch both dudes play and how both dudes are defended and it's abundantly clear who the better jump shooter is. You cannot stop Anthony Davis by building a wall.
"""Joe! Pants Anthony Davis!"" ""Hey Joe! You see Alex Caruso? Give him a scalp message, buddy."""

"I think if you swap Anthony Davis for Jaylen Brown and make Brown the second option on the Lakers then they're probably not winning the title either, and they're one of the deepest teams in the league. I think we have to at least entertain the idea that Brown is not good enough to be the second best player on a championship team, or at least he's not good enough yet."
Giannis needs to learn to shoot like Anthony Davis for that to work
Facts. Every year it seems a top prospect is coming outta Chicago. Anthony Davis was one of em
No lol. A marquee matchup like bucks vs lakers say Anthony Davis is hurt he probably won’t play that game but when they play a month or two later he’ll probably be available. That’s the downside of having back to Back to back matchups like that
"I think Joakim Noah did it a few years ago. But he’s the only one I know off the top of my head. Before him...maybe Mutombo or Shawn Bradley? David Robinson?

"No. DPOY isn't just about counting stats and one fucking game isn't going to suddenly catapult him into contention. Rudy Gobert, Myles Turner, Joel Embiid, and Anthony Davis are the front runners and I don't see Capela breaking into the top 4, let alone top 3 for the award."

Anthony Davis doesn’t exist on this earth?

"Actually think it's more likely Harden guards AD he did at times in the playoffs last year. Kevin Durant and AD couldnt guard each other before the KD achilles I wouldnt want to try it now. Jeff Green on AD last year in the playoffs was no good if Green is out there rather have him on LeBron.   Think Lakers would put Schroder on Kyrie, KCP on Harden, LeBron on Durant with some Anthony Davis also."
Anthony Davis can shoot.
I’m feeling pretty good :) Can’t wait til Anthony Davis decides to give a shit.
They only person shaq should grill is the president of basketball operations for the jazz. Do i think Rudy gobert should be getting more money then anthony davis-fuck no. But shaq shouldn’t be pressing rudy gobert’s teammates about it. Thats on the Utah Jazz’s management so shaq should just leave it at that.
"The opposing team would have to play a true center to even slow him down when Shaq’s on offense. Guys like Elden Campbell, Dale Davis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Vlade Divac, etc got the match up because teams needed to put big bodies on Shaq. There were people who only had a roster spot to be a body to put on Shaq and give up 5/6 fouls. These guys typically didn’t have the athleticism and the perimeter shooting that you’d see from today’s bigs like Anthony Davis, Draymond Green, or Nikola Jokic. Part of why position-less basketball is as prevalent as it is is because there is no Shaq in the league bulldozing people in the paint."
"You’ll probably tell me a player like Anthony Davis or Jokic or other modern centers are more impactful than Shaq was, right? I’d tell you you’re absolutely wrong and there’s really no stat you could tell me to change my opinion.  Shaq would dominate in any era of NBA basketball - period. The same way Lebron would, MJ, CP3, and some others. There are just some talents that transcend any era of basketball. You don’t need to look at a stat sheet, watch a regular season game of prime Shaq. Not a playoff game or championship series, just any regular ole game. Tell me he didn’t completely dictate the game plan for both his and the opposing team. There’s a reason he won those finals MVPs over Kobe, he was just that good.   The beauty of this argument is it literally can never be proved either way cause Shaq won’t be lacing up anytime soon. But I can tell you, time and time again this sub shows major recency bias. Maybe not you but so many others."
"Yeah no shit they don't want to get rid of their best player. Why is this even an article?  ""Word around the league is the Mavericks have no interest in trading Luka doncic. Also, we're receiving reports that the Lakers intend to do 'everything in their power' to keep LeBron James and Anthony Davis. More updates as this story unfolds"""

"ironically it's Anthony Davis (who would be the ideal fit next to anyone).  AD plays great individual &amp; team defense and can stretch to the perimeter.  Zion has the beef and can bang bodies down low, also he's a good ball handler &amp; playmaker so they'd be great with one another."
"&gt;KD has Harden/Kyrie, George and Kawhi have each other   i love how you dont mention Lebron is playing with Anthony Davis"
Anthony “Kevin loved’” Davis
"It's not the same and you know it.  Gobert is a traditional center. He guards Joel Embiid. He guards Anthony Davis. He guards Jokic. He guards the other elite centers. He's not an athletic freak that can guard multiple positions like Giannis.   Giannis has the build to guard guys like Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler. He's one of the very few guys that can legitimately guard any position. That's so incredibly valuable as demonstrated by the way the Lakers used Davis last year but for some reason, maybe it's coaching idk, Giannis is often not put on these guys in the biggest moments of games.   Jimmy Butler was killing them in must-win games and he never took that assignment, even though he has the wingspan and body to do it. You don't see a problem with that?"
Yes. For Anthony. Davis.
Anthony Davis has been pretty solid for you guys
He literally has Anthony Davis as his teammates Giannis had a better record and he didn’t have a AD like teammate
Anthony Davis is one of the only players I’ve ever seen who can visibly be 100% uninterested in the game and still have a big impact
Anthony davis too skilled
curious. do any of y’all have anthony davis top 5?
Anthony Davis didn’t come to play today. Looks tired out there. Isn’t running hard or battling for position.
"M..  Mil...  ""Anthony davis blah blah""  Milwaukee..  ""1 for 7 blah blah"""
"I'm not even trying to be biassed towards anyone. Let's take a look at Rockets previous 5 games and see what the bigs have done against them:  * LA Lakers: Anthony Davis has 19 pts, 10 reb, 5 blk, 2 ast, 7/8 shooting * San Antonio Spurs: Aldridge has 11 pts, 2 reb, 1 ast, 4/10 shooting * San Antonio Spurs: Aldridge has 4 pts, 2 reb, 2 ast, 2/7 shooting * Chicago Bulls: Markannen has 18 pts, 7 reb, 2 stl, 5/12 shooting * Phoenix Suns: Deandre Ayton has 26 pts, 17 reb, 5 blks, 3 ast, 11/15 shooting  If you guys aren't gelling yet defensively, surely someone else would've gone off.   Anyways, good luck for the rest of the season."
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
"The notorious under the radar first seed in the west with the runner up MVP, LeBron James, and the runner up DPOY, Anthony Davis, playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, famously an under the radar franchise"
&gt;It's like asking the Pelicans to trade rookie Anthony Davis.  Lmao no it's not.
"""Wiggins’ on-ball defense has opponents shooting 40.0 percent, better than such respected defenders as Oklahoma City’s Luguentz Dort (43.3), Boston’s Jaylen Brown (43.5) and Toronto’s Pascal Siakam (44.0).  On shots from 15 feet or further, where many wings thrive, the failure rate against Wiggins is 67.4 percent, roughly the same as Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis (67.5) and better than Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard (61.4) and Portland’s 3-and-D wing Robert Covington (59.3). The failure rate against Mavericks forward Dorian Finney-Smith, considered a “defensive specialist,” is 63.9.""  Also has the highest contest rate for warriors  For all the people in sub wanting to check the stats .He really has had a good start to the campaign"
"Wiseman is not, and will never be, equivalent to Anthony Davis"
"tbh i feel like the nets will be like last year's clippers, over confident that they own their conference because of their star power and get knocked off by some team that finds out how to exploit their defense. I know they beat the bucks recently, but i think that the bucks, philly and boston could capitalize on their confidence and exploit their defensive shortcomings. Harden is a great person to attack because hes defensively lazy and if you put size on him in the paint he'll get destroyed. Not gonna rule out the nets being able to beat the lakers, but i really don't think they have the kind of size and defensive fortitude to stop anthony davis or lebron."
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
ok now compare donovan mitchell as that guy compared to lebron names and anthony davis or kawhi leonard
Are you trying to argue that  Mike Conley is as impactful as Anthony Davis?
"&gt; Meanwhile, the Lakers barely squeaked by Detroit and OKC.   Anthony Davis"
"8 games is a ton in one season.  they had a top 10 defense.  eric gordon and ryan anderson were our 2nd and 3rd best players.  the season before those guys were with anthony davis and went 30-52.  and they were 13-24 when all 3 played so it's not like it was just injuries.  in the games where they played with harden, they were 45-20.  preseason expectations were low because people didn't think even someone like harden could elevate such a group, but he did."
"AD isn't questionable, [he said this after last night's game:](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/2/12/22281398/lakers-anthony-davis-achilles-injury-update-recovery)  &gt; “It felt great, I’ll get some treatment on it tomorrow and get ready for Denver.”  If you're thinking he's limited, I suggest you check out the 35 points he scored last night."
Anthony Davis is also better than he was 2-3 years ago  Also there are a lot of good players besides Davis and LeBron
"We've seen Anthony Davis lead teams with better teammates than the non-LeBron Lakers, and none of those teams were high seeds. They often weren't even seeds at all."
"Starters  G: Stephen Curry  G: Damian Lillard  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: Lebron James  F: Nikola Jokic  Reserves  G: Luka Doncic  G: Donovan Mitchell  F: Anthony Davis   F: Paul George  F: Rudy Gobert  WC: Devin Booker  WC: CP3  These are just my predictions, not who I necessarily *think* should make it. For example, De’aaron Fox absolutely deserves a spot imo, but I think he’ll get the Booker treatment from years past where his team just isn’t good enough to get picked over guards on playoff teams."
"**Starters**.      - G: Stephen Curry - G: Damian Lillard - F: Kawhi Leonard - F: Lebron James - F: Nikola Jokic    **Reserves**.     - G: Luka Doncic - G: Donovan Mitchell - F: Anthony Davis.   - F: Paul George.   - F: Rudy Gobert.   - WC: Devin Booker.   - WC: Chris Paul.      ----      SGA, Fox and Zion could all make the team over CP3 and I wouldn't complain but I think the winning record for Phoenix deserves to be recognised and both CP3 and Booker have been playing at an All-Star level."
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
"Fun question!  Lakers have their 2 superstars in LeBron and Anthony Davis that are both physical specimens and also happen to be very good at every aspect of the game. Having those two is a bit of a trump card in lots of games, but their supporting cast is well-constructed around them.  On offense they’re are great at getting fast break points, but also have some legitimate 3-point threats this year (though they’ve gone pretty cold the last few games). And when all else fails, LeBron is one of the All-Time great isolation threats; even at 36 he’s still got elite strength and athleticism to go along with his improved shooting, passing, and wily-old-man tricks.  But even if nothing seems to work on offense, they have lock-down defense. They don’t force a ton of turnovers, but they block a surprising amount of shots and just make it really tough to score.  Lately they’ve been ATROCIOUS in the 1st quarter, but at least 1 (usually 2) of quarters 2-4 they look essentially unstoppable.  I really enjoy watching this team (except in the 1st quarter), but I’ve also been a Lakers homer since I was about 8 years old in 1996, so I’m a bit biased."
"Grizzlies fan here who lives in an unpopulated state-   I don’t mind a few fans, but my fucking god lakers fan and clippers fans are purposely trying to be obnoxious.   Lebron, Anthony Davis, Playoff P, and Kawhi didn’t come to LA because of a good coach or anything, they came to los angeles because it’s fucking los angeles. The Lakers and Clippers will always get the free agent over the Grizzlies. There’s no point in coming to Memphis unless we overpay them.   Lakers fans can live in comfort knowing that even if they lose their players and become a shitty team, they’ll still manage to sign big name free agents and immediately become contenders by doing absolutely no work.   Memphis, OKC, Minnesota, Utah, on the other hand, have to grind through years of pain just to hopefully get a competent enough front office and to develop enough players to maybe get into contention.   It’s not like this is a huge disparity in which small market teams need a handicap, but there’s obviously geographic favoritism towards the bigger cities."
"I’m of the unpopular belief that being the main option on your team makes it harder to score. Anthony Davis has no problem averaging 27 ppg last season with Lebron, because he couldn’t get doubled, teams would much rather focus on the arguable GOAT  On the flip side there’s Beal and Steph who can barely get shots off."
"Yeah just because some of those guys can be primary ball handlers doesn't mean you'd get diminishing returns. Steph is an elite off-ball player, KD is one of the best shooters in the league. Kawhi would benefit even more when paired with a ball-handler since while he's an improved playmaker, benefitted from a guy like Lowry. Jokic is still also an elite pick and roll partner, so would be a tremendous second option as well.   I don't think being a good second option is a great argument for a player being better than guys who can be Championship Contenders as the first option, unless you believe AD can be close to that as the first also, which there definitely is some reason to believe. But I think a better way to look at it is put PG, an elite 2-way player (who can be a second option of a chamionship team and first on a legitimate playoff team) with any of the guys we are talking about, and Paul George/Anthony Davis is probably the worst duo.  Again, as we are showing there are arguments both ways."
It’s hilarious to hear Lakers fans flip at supersonic speed between saying that Anthony Davis is a top 5 player or that Lebron is hard carrying and Davis is being outplayed this year by Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris
"I have to wonder how well you remember the 3 games between the Lakers and Jazz last season when you say all of this, because the Lakers absolutely abused Utah all three times last year. None of the games were even particularly competitive. Utah relies heavily on Gobert to protect the paint and on outside shooting. Anthony Davis always pulls Gobert away from the basket, which renders his defense far less effective, and the Lakers are one of the best at covering perimeter shooters. Just look at how masterful they were in the playoffs at absolutely locking down other teams' 3-pt shooting. For Donovan Mitchell the Lakers have a bunch of guys to put on him who are bigger and stronger than he is, in KCP, Caruso and even LeBron if they want to (just look at LeBron's defense against Jamal Murray in last year's WCF). And the Lakers can match his quickness with Schroder, who is also a great defender.   The Lakers weren't built with the Jazz in mind, but nonetheless the Lakers are perfectly equipped to neutralize everything Utah wants to do, and that was painfully evident last season. But on the other end, the Jazz have a *major* flaw when it comes to trying to defend the Lakers, as they have nobody to put on LeBron. They really don't have anyone to guard AD either, as he always roasts Gobert. I mean, [just look at their last meeting if you doubt that.](https://youtu.be/bOLwalTFgCA) The Clippers represent a much bigger threat to the Lakers, IMO (provided Paul George is ever healthy again, of course). I would love it if the Jazz could take out the Clippers in the 2nd round and leave the Lakers to only have to face Utah. That would be a very easy series for the Lakers, IMO."
"They went way too experimental with small ball. PJ Tucker as Center?! At least Durant or Draymond have length to be center-esque in their play.  Like they should have known any competent team with even one big man could have made their playoff run a disaster. And they were in the Western conference with a Lakers team consisting of Lebron James, who had Austin Rivers on him at one point, Dwight Howard, who is still a relatively flexible big man, Anthony Davis, a younger dominant big man, and Kostas Atetokounmpo  on the Bench, who’s not his brother, but in a pinch has a serviceable game.  Like skill is good. But skill and height is REALLY good."

"If Anthony Davis starts playing better then maybe. But, you have to give the field a chance too. The NBA is unpredictable (except for 2017 and 2018 when we all knew who was gonna win it)."
LeBron’s longevity is insane. Anthony Davis was an 11 year old boy watching him in his rookie season. Now he’s 27 playing alongside him and he’s still the best player in the league
So what happened to Anthony Davis???
Anthony Davis is very good at basketball.
"20 point lead, league’s best defense, y’all tried to zone against two of the highest iq players in the league + Anthony Davis. That played a pretty big part."
Rudy get owned by Anthony Davis and Jokic everytime how is he front runner for DPOY lol and also Giannis went off on him in the 2nd half so.
Giannis is better than Anthony Davis.   /Thread
"This is the least excited I've been to hear ""Anthony davis returns to the floor""..."
Jonas looking down on Anthony Davis after playing good defense totally won't come back to haunt him.
Anthony Davis legit fucking blows
"Anthony ""Stop the Steal"" Davis."
"&gt;The only active players good at post ups are Embiid and Jokic.  I am positive that Anthony Davis would like a word, there.  Actually, Davis already had that word, when he averaged 31 a game against Jokic and the Nuggets in the playoffs last year, while shooting 54%.  There are also a few other guys around the league who are useful in the low post, they just don't get near as many touches, for various reasons."
"I think it would be interesting to look at average difference in win shares between the 1st and 2nd pick in the draft. You’ve got your Shaq and Alonzo Mourning cases: transcendent player and all star quality but far away in comparison:  Your Duncan/Van Horn in a transcendent player and a quality starter but the gap is bigger  Then the Lebron/Darko case: transcendent player and bust.  Like since 1990, the best number 2 picks have been KD, Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, and Alonzo Mourning.   An MVP all timer, two all time point guards who couldn’t quite be the best player on a championship team and an all star who was never really the best at his position.  Contrast that with the 1st picks with Shaq, Chris Webber, AI, Tim Duncan, Lebron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, and that’s just the 1st team MVP types.  Then you’ve got Kyrie, Ben Simmons, KAT, Larry Johnson, Yao, Blake Griffin, John wall, multiple time all stars who have been the best player on a playoff team (or in the case of Simmons and KAT will obviously get there)   That’s 15 guys in 30 years who can be the best player on a 50 win team. That’s good odds"
"You realize a play in team competes with most teams in the nba right? On any given night they’d be able to beat mavs, suns, Spurs, grizzlies, etc. Lebron takes that fringe playoff team to a championship favorite (which is a huge complement). I just don’t think this roster is as poorly constructed as people make it seem. Their second unit is better than most other in the nba which would keep them in most games by themselves.  Anthony Davis is a tier below lebron obviously in just about everything so I don’t expect him to match that. But AD’s teams were atrocious for the most part. I just scrolled through his seasons."
"Anthony Davis has been playing much worse than Steph Curry did, and you're blatantly ignoring that KD also played with Klay and Draymond. LeBron's defense is also better than KD."
You gonna really compare draymond to anthony davis?
Every fan base does this. You also had Lakers fans who didn't want LeBron or trashed Anthony Davis because of his injury history.   People change.
"God I'm tired of hearing this.  19 out of 20 ESPN analysts picked us to lose in 5 games or less.  We played the Lakers after playing balls to the wall for 8 do or die games while missing our starting PF, starting SF, and our backup SF.  We started an undrafted rookie against Anthony Davis and Gary Trent Jr, a 2nd year 2nd rounder that's 6'5, against Lebron.  Oh and CJ had a broken back and Dame went down with a knee injury.    People were just looking for a story and we were the victims of it."

Steph should win mvp over lebron imo cuz lebron has anthony davis steph has almost nobody. Theyre both ballin though
"Well now in his defense Chuck is saying something somewhat obvious, but the thing is there is only some much room for primary ball handlers at the NBA level. Good modern teams have skilled bigs who can shoot plus not get killed on switches, and at least 2 ball-handling combo guard types. Ideally you wanna surround those guys with 3 and D wings. If you're the average 6'6"" NBA player, what do you think your best chance of getting playing time is? Not everyone is Dame Lillard or Anthony Davis. You're gonna want to be a 3 and D wing so you're gonna focus on shooting and defense. Obviously modern guys aren't as well rounded as older generations but they're really fucking good at the things they are good at. Let's be real, most teams would take plus defender wings who can shoot as role players over average, well rounded players who can't defend or shoot at an elite level."
"Lmfao think about this for a second. You really think the damn media is going to vote for Gobert over Anthony Davis, a Lakers player and best defender on the #1 defense?"
"It was diagnosed as such when [the initial report came out,](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30858681/los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-very-likely-miss-monday-game-achilles-injury) I just think most people were wanting to fixate on the word ""tendinosis"" rather than dig into what the report actually said:  &gt; A league source told ESPN on Sunday that Davis, 27, has been managing the discomfort ""for a while."" Davis underwent medical imaging on the injury, the source said, which assured the Achilles tendon is in good shape. However, the nine-year veteran has been experiencing tightness in his right leg, causing concern."
Embiid talking [shit about AD](https://twitter.com/MunchTVx/status/1355634898678198272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1355634898678198272%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fjoel-embiid-playing-fifa-harder-guarding-anthony-davis-lakers-sixers-020609179.html) was pretty funny too. Trash talk game A+
"Yeah idk how he has no case when he's on a team with the second best record in the league (half a game back of *the* best record) and averaging 25.5 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists, 1.1 steals, 0.5 blocks, 59.7% TS.  Plus Anthony Davis hasn't been amazing either."
Definitely not. It’s just funny to think we live in a world where Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol at C isn’t good enough
He should be more efficient then not less. Why can’t u just admit he underperformed at the start of the year though? This whole sub was bashing him for it. Why are u tearing down ad but not willing to admit Simmons underperformed as well?  Edit:  Anthony Davis this year: 22/9 on 59 TS%  Anthony Davis last year: 26/9 on 61 TS%  Lol you don’t see your blatant hypocrisy? Big deal man ad is avg 4 less pts and shooting 2% worse? Sound familiar?
Other than playing every game in a condensed schedule (would not recommend and obviously out of the players control a lot this year) there is nothing more Joel can do. He is scoring more points in fewer minutes and drastically better true shooting percentage. Not to mention he's probably playing like a top two defender this season.   LeBron is far more likely to play better than Embiid is honestly. Embiid isn't going to raise his TS% from 67% to 70+%. The award is already LeBron's unless the Lakers fall off. And with Anthony Davis and LeBron James I don't see that happening.
"If contending were their goal, wouldn't trading the pick for a veteran (or move down in the draft) make more sense.  In fact you have to expect them to deal the Minny pick, or else add another kid to a team where Steph is turning 35 the next season. Not sure if its wise to expect them to be battling the likes of LeBron James and Anthony Davis so young."
Lakers - Injuries   Rest of the western Conference - healthy  LeBron James and Anthony Davis .
"You think that in the regular season, LeBron had an actual argument for being MVP over Giannis? Let's really quick go through that statement  Record: Bucks won more games than the Lakers  Statistics: Giannis had more PPG, rebounds, less turnovers, more blocks, was a better defender (some would say DPOY level), had a higher TS% on less minutes per game and got subbed out in the second half regularly.   Help: LeBron had Anthony Davis, Giannis had Khris Middleton  The only possible argument for LeBron last year was narrative."
he got anthony davis
Anthony Davis did.
Have you seen his performance or even just his stats? The only reason he's still averaging over 20ppg is because he gets a lot of FTs and he's so bad this season even at that he has a lower % THAN LEBRON. 80% or higher FT shooter for the last 4 seasons Anthony Davis dropped down to 70%  Achilles Tendinosis for a big guy like him who suffered hip and ankle injuries just the past playoffs will do that. He is legit playing like a shell of himself  If you actually watched us you would know but you're just here to prop up AD to downplay LeBron's season so far
Below Julius Randle and Eldridge Payton  Above Lebron James and Anthony Davis
"If you’re really a bulls fan, and you actually watch the team play its games, you wouldn’t say shit like this.   The team has been missing 3 starters for significant portions of the season so far.   By your criteria, Anthony Davis should have only been selected as an all star twice during his time with the Pelicans."
If Anthony Davis continues to be disappointing. Yes
"1st team should be Rudy Gobert, Lebron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Shake Milton.  2nd team should be Joel Embid, Christian Wood, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley. Not sure about the other guard.   Myles Turner and OG Anunoby shouldn't make all-defense. Leading the league in blocks/steals has a separate award."

"because that entire TEAM was fucking absurd and unlike any other team in NBA history. Voters understand that it would be a 60 win team even without either of the superstars. It was 2 super duper stars and 2 all stars with a FMVP on top that won 73 games without Durant.   Durant only played 62 games so he's out of the conversation for that alone. Not even mentioning they were a really solid team while he was injured.  Curry's numbers were good but didn't scream MVP. The team won less games after adding a top 3 player in the league. Russ, Harden, Kawhi and LeBron all had really great seasons.   Jordan won MVPs with Pippen, Magic won with Kareem, Shaq won with Kobe, LeBron won with Wade, Malone won with Stockton. Bird won with McHale.  These situations were not the same as 2017. Those teams were not juggernauts even without their MVP. Anthony Davis is not the same thing as KD+Klay+Dray"

"I see your point, but in another comment you were comparing Melo unfavorably to CP3 and Westbrook, but those 2 players had Blake Griffin, KD, Paul George, and Harden as their teammates in their primes.   The rosters around Melo in New York were unbelievably bad - every year. If you look them up it makes Anthony Davis' teammates in New Orleans look amazing and he couldnt do much there either. There's a reason why they went 4-40 without him after he had knee surgery during the season.  It wasn't just Melo taking a lot of money. Knicks are infamous for their poor management and decisions, and even after he left they haven't been able to attract any good free agents.  Again, I see your point but CP3 and Westbrook have had way better teammates so it's apples to oranges"
"Those 2 that you are comparing Melo too also had Blake Griffin, KD, Harden (on multiple teams) in their primes. Melo’s best teammates in New York have been JR Smith and Rookie Porzingis. Anthony Davis couldn’t do anything in New Orleans either and he had way better teammates than Melo ever had"
Anthony Davis has mastered that

I guess we will. AD is averaging 22/9/3 and is the best defender on the #1 defense. Also he’s Anthony Davis and plays for the Lakers. There is zero chance Gobert makes All-NBA over him.
Giannis and Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis has been playing like straight up shit
"Thanks to our friend Steve Javie for enlightening us how the ref was right for ejecting Cousins despite not being in this state, Mark, it was because the ref felt threatened when DeMarcus apparently tweeted #BallDontLie after Luka Doncic missed his 1st freethrow when he allegedly jumped into Anthony Davis  JVG: but why do they call it twitter?

They've finished 2nd and 3rd in the west the past 2 seasons. Something anthony davis could never do as a #1 option
"To be fair, this is how a trade should be, especially for Anthony Davis level talent. No one considering scrubs at that point 😎"
"No, people say the Lakers will win because they have Lebron James and Anthony Davis."
"Firstly Embiid didn't get taken advantage of last year. He was great on both ends but it didn't matter because when we lost Simmons we not only lost his perimeter defense, we lost shot creating, the ability to make simple entry passes, the ability to score *at all* in the fastbreak, and his overall playmaking.   Secondly it really seems like the only thing you disagree with me on is how well Jokic is playing on defense. We both (correct me if I'm wrong) think that his teammates' defense needs to be better. I'm not saying it's Jokic's fault you guys aren't winning more, in fact the way the offense runs through him he is moreso the reason you guys are even as high as you are in the standings. I don't believe Jokic needs to be all things and an unstoppable two-way monster. The Nuggets know who he is (and you say he's even gotten better on that end) and they should surround him with better defensive talent.   Just like the Jazz need Mitchell to shoot as much as he does even when he isn't being efficient because they lack scoring especially off the dribble. Gobert is limited offensively so they need Mitchell to score for them and they don't need scoring from Gobert as much.   Anthony Davis is an amazing help defender and can lock down most fours and small ball fives. But he needs a center next to him to protect the rim and do the things centers need to do to have a great defense. He isn't a center but he doesn't need to be.   I could go on but the bottom line is Jokic is an amazing offensive player whom your entire offense revolves around (another issue that seems to rear it's head when he sits). He reminds me of Ben Simmons (especially before the massive jump in scoring this year) in that most fans see highlights or watch a game or two and don't understand what's so special about their passing. But the placement of the passes really does set their teammates up for success in ways that aren't even evident for most upon replay. But the center position does not get to choose whether or not it will be impactful on defense the way other positions do. It just doesn't. So the players you mentioned need to play better defense, all of them, or Jokic does. And because he is the center *just* him playing better defense will be as impactful as all of them doing so. Again, that's always been my opinion of the important of defense for a center.   I'm not saying he isn't doing enough, or he should reasonably be expected to do more, I'm literally just answering the question. I mean, maybe he could average 40/15/15 but that doesn't seem like a reasonable ask for me. The question is what more he could do. I literally don't think he could be doing any more on offense considering his production and how much he plays. He is literally my number two MVP right now and there's a gap between him and number three. But he *could* do more on defense."
"Let me try listing who I think was better.      First the undeniably better players: Lebron, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Westbrook, CP3, Anthony Davis.      Then the players who were top 5 players for like 3-5 of the years in that decade so I'd rate them higher: Wade, Duncan, Giannis, Kobe, Dirk.        Then the players who were just better than him, not sure how it works for a whole decade: Lillard, Klay, PG13, Butler, Kyrie, LMA.      So maybe he could scrape in the back end of the top 20 based on the list I have, but there might be others I'm missing that are obvious picks."
i mean he's a 20-year old averaging 15.6/5.6/3.7 per 36 while playing actual minutes on a team behind anthony davis and lebron james. i'm not saying he's a superstar or ever will be but it's clear the lakers struck gold on this one
"Now you're acting as if he's Anthony Davis. You're not getting multiple first for Lavine. One young talent/project, filler and draft pick is the best you'll get."
Lol Anthony Davis is my favorite player in the NBA... am I the only one ? Only non Knicks player I’ve ever considered getting the jersey of
"Vogel is just being realistic. Kuzma is a 4/3 that is playing behind Anthony Davis and Lebron. He’s a good player who would deserve a larger role on almost any other team, but I support Vogel in trying to get him to capitalize on his current 22-25 mpg as much as possible.   Sure Vogel could have started Kuz tonight and played him starter minutes, but come playoff time that won’t be Kuz’s role. Coach just wants Kuz getting as much practice in his envisioned role as much as possible before playoff time. Morris, who started tonight, probably will only get spot minutes in the important games assuming a healthy roster."
Anthony Day-to-Davis is one of the better recent NBA nicknames.
Bro Anthony Davis is literally on your team glass houses my man
God I fucking hate Anthony Davis
"Bruh we have Anthony Davis, 2 6MOTY, and 3 45%+ 3P shooters. Lakers without Bron would destroy Warriors without Curry"
"You're a Timberwolves fan, so I don't blame you for not knowing what the playoffs are, but here's why Towns is nowhere near Jokic or Embiid or Anthony Davis in New Orleans:  **Playoff stats:**  **Jokic:** 33 games, 24.7 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 6.9 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.8 BPG, shooting 51%/41%/84% (60% true shooting)  **Embiid:** 23 games, 22.3 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 2.9 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.9 BPG, shooting 43%/28%/78% (55% true shooting)  **Davis (New Orleans only):** 13 games, 30.5 PPG, 12.7 RPG, 1.8 APG, 1.8 SPG, 2.5 BPG, shooting 52%/25%/85% (59% true shooting)  **Towns:** 5 games, 15.2 PPG, 13.4 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.0 BPG, shooting 46%/27%/73% (54% true shooting)  Jokic and Embiid and AD in New Orleans have all been the best players on teams that went to the second round of the playoffs or beyond. Jokic and AD raised their game in the playoffs to a ridiculous level.   Towns can't make the playoffs without Jimmy Butler dragging his ass, and he was absolutely awful when he got there.   Those guys are all way better than Towns in the regular season too. Towns is one of the worst defensive big men in the league. Embiid and Davis are perennial DPOY candidates. Jokic is a better defender than Towns, too, and given their respective physical tools that should really not be the case.   There's just no argument for Towns to be in a tier with those three."
"He is one of those players that are kind of frustrating because he could be so much better.   In college as a freshmen he was a 20/11 player with 65% TS. That is rare company and has the potential to be a 25 point scorer in the NBA. He supposedly has a [43.5 inch vert](https://twitter.com/deandreayton/status/912502520609521664?lang=en) with elite length. Ricky Rubio made Nikola Pekovic make a lot of money and gave Kevin Love his best years. Chris Paul is Chris Paul. How isn't he a 20+ scorer by now? We can't use the excuse that he hasn't had pg's that can pass. By the time Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Joel Embiid, Kevin Garnett, and Giannis were 22 years old they were all 20 ppg+ scorers already. Many of us were hoping he would turn into them and his first two years he had a trajectory that he might but then going back down to 14 ppg is a little disappointing. However, the Suns play a super slow pace with Chris Paul and have bottom 5 lowest possessions per game in the NBA when last year they were top 10 so everyone's stats is going to go down a little bit. Additionally, the Suns have a lot of mouths to feed with 7 players scoring in double digits (6 players if you don't count Dario who only played 6 games)."
"So here’s what the Lakers fans did and it worked out pretty well for us: Stage a protest in front of the arena and try out the following speech...  First thing’s first; fire everyone. Second thing; get all the best players back. Third time; we uh, get like uh, cool, kinda like, rec center? For them to all hang out in and I can hang out with the players.   Badabing badaboom, Lebron James and Anthony Davis take you to the promise land"
"AD had nothing to do with recruiting/scouting THT, he barely even knew who he was. It was LeBron who told Rich Paul.  [Anthony Davis Didn’t Know About Talen Horton-Tucker](https://lakersnation.com/lakers-news-anthony-davis-didnt-know-about-talen-horton-tucker-draft/2021/01/14/)  &gt;Though not for James, who alerted agent Rich Paul after watching Horton-Tucker in high school. Paul has gone on to represent the youngster as well.  &gt;Davis, on the other hand, had barely heard of Horton-Tucker, despite also being from Chicago. “I don’t really follow that much basketball, to be honest, so I heard of him but I didn’t really pay attention or anything like that,” Davis revealed.  &gt;“I’m from Chicago, so I hear about a lot of the kids coming out of Chicago, a lot of names. But I never really watched him play. When the Lakers drafted him and he signed with Klutch, Rich and some other people told me about him, so then I went back and watched highlights and stuff like that. I was like, ‘Oh, we got a steal.’"
This reminds me of the time I had a three-day-long twitter fight with some guy because I said John Stockton was a better basketball player than Anthony Davis.
The only player today that could be a good comparison to what KG could be in today's NBA is Anthony Davis.
"But that would imply this sub loves teams other than their beloved Los Angeles Lakers, who they've been watching since all the way back when Anthony Davis joined the team"

with top 5 player anthony davis on the team.
Yeah. I’m confident in the Cs. Also all star wing backcourt pairing in their prime is rare. The last one was Jordan and Pippen so I can see the Jays being that lite. Yeah the Celtics had a 30 year drought and y’all are just catching up to them in chips (if you count the Minnesota ones) congratulations. And yeah you should win a chip when you sign the best player in the game due to your location and then have a generational talent force his way there. The Lakers did nothing to get that ring except be in LA. You’re projecting because I am not mad that the Celtics with a player still in his rookie contract as their best player couldn’t win a ring before LeBron James and Anthony Davis at 35 and 26.  Russell Kareem and Jordan. Could also make cases for Bird and Magic but I moved LeBron up for last year.   I don’t know but I have faith. I responded to the other dude calling the Celtics mediocre. Y’all are having your run rn and we had our run earlier. That’s the game of Basketball.  But if you’re asking me to project out the next 20 years I like the Celtics chances better than the Lakers.
"Yeah I mean I think people think I am shit-talking KG more than I actually am here. Siakam is lightning-quick with a 7'3"" wingspan and Millsap has been a perennial plus-minus darling due to his defensive awareness and motor. I guess the main thing I am underselling here is KG's motor, so, like, throw Marcus Smart in there too.  All I'm trying to say is that as a shot-blocker and roll-man, he wasn't even quite on the level of somebody like lob-city DeAndre Jordan or Anthony Davis (look at the numbers on block rates for example). This isn't just coming from numbers for me, think back to '02-'03 when the Wolves lost to the Lakers in the first round - KG had a great series but he was not really able to bully Robert Horry the way Duncan was in the next round (this series is burned in my brain because I hated those god damn Lakers).  So in the modern NBA his game wouldn't look all that much like AD or Bam, he really would be more of a power forward. You wouldn't want to use him much as the screen-setter in PnR and you would want someone else out there to bang with bully-ball centers (tangentially, imagine time-travel KG paired with KAT or Jokic).  I can see why there are AD comparisons because AD is the only guy impacting defense from the 4 like KG did but I think it's pretty different because AD is a better shot-blocker (who probably should be playing 5) and KG, especially early-career, was an _even better_ perimeter defender than AD is now. On offense, AD is a better roll man than KG was, but also I think often tries to play like KG used to and doesn't do it quite as well. That's why I reached for Siakam and Millsap, because I feel like those two are the power forwards who are closest to replicating KG's physical tools (Siakam) and defensive IQ (Millsap), but obviously combining the two and adding that Marcus Smart-esque fire yields an all-time level PF."
"I am actually surprised that this is so controversial  I am comparing KG to a current player with elite physical tools (Siakam) and another one with elite BBIQ and a polished face-up game (Millsap). You combine those guys and you get a DPoY power forward.  AD is arguably the best lob finisher in the league and also one of the best rim protectors. Bam has got the strength to bang with anyone. I don't think I'm doing KG a disservice by saying he was not on AD's level as a lob finisher or rim protector or that he didn't have Bam's strength.  Maybe I'm just higher on Anthony Davis than everyone else in this thread, IDK."
"Anthony Davis takes and makes far more 3s, but KG blows AD away as a mid range shooter."
"Assists can be more sexy. Look at Nash, Kidd, Magic, Pistol Pete and White Chocolate. Those guys had a lot flair and creativity. Stockton simply wasnt very flashy. There are a lot of guys that put up points, but are still boring to watch, like Anthony Davis. AD is actually more fun to watch on defense cause of his versatility."
"- LeBron + Davis: +14.2 net rating  - LeBron w/o Davis: +5.9 net rating  - Davis w/o LeBron: -0.9 net rating   This is for all the dumb asses who think Davis is more important to the team than LeBron. These numbers were *worse* last season. If it was LeBron missing all this time, the Lakers would look like a G League team. If you think the offence is bad now, imagine Anthony Davis trying to consistently create his own shot and set up others.  This team without Davis for the rest of the season is a first round destruction. They'd stand a chance of winning a series with just LeBron."

"Honest question, I am obviously a Jazz fan, how much of a difference does Anthony Davis make tonight? I feel like he is not gonna help the three balls from dropping which is what is killing LA."

You’re Anthony Davis/Paul George in 2019. Lebron/Kawhi already on the Lakers/Clippers.

The NBA announces Devin Booker will replace Anthony Davis in the All-Star Game next month.
"He tore his ACL in college and that really zapped some athleticism from him IMO. Dude was a better defender than Anthony Davis in college, but after his ACL tear he pretty noticeably took a step back even though he's still a pretty good defender.   His major problem was that he had practically no offensive game whatsoever, and scouts assumed he could learn one after he was drafted."

Can't wait to watch Collin Sexton instead of Harden or Kyrie or Anthony Davis
I think Balding is a better term.   Caruso only became the Meme because his hairline got back on defense early and he didn’t buzz it. Instead he just kept the balding look.   If Caruso just buzzed it from the start then nobody cares. It’s similar to Anthony Davis w/ his Unibrow.
"I totally agree with you, but the guy has strong leadership qualities.

Exactly Hakeem v Jordan would be more like Anthony Davis v Luka. I wouldn't fault a team for taking this 7 foot monster who at the very least is an All-Defense player.
he was not unanimous.  there were some Luka people back then.    this isn't like Anthony Davis or Zion went 1.
"You can’t make everyone happy. Booker will probably replace Anthony Davis and make the all star team.I would have picked him over CP3, but it’s very close. Sabonis,Trae Young, Derozan, Middleton are all having all star caliber seasons, but the competition is great. I feel bad for Sabonis, but who are you supposed to take off the all star team then? They all deserve it. I think they did a good job picking the reserves."
"Doncic is the epitomin of modern basketball. He was MVP in the second best League in the world at 19. Playing proffesionaly since being 15. It was a no brainer that you should take the kid 1st unless there is a Lebron, Jordan or Anthony Davis in the draft.  There is no reason to take a decent prospect at the ""least"" valuable position today and not take the best prospect available since ever.  You can somehow argue Hakeem over Jordan. Iverson over Kobe. Harden over Curry. But there is absolutely no argument for Ayton over Doncic. Most draft ""experts"" put DeAndre at 1st because they knew the connection with the Suns owner and his intentions to pick him first. It was ""cheap"" win that they predicted the 1st, so that they can advertised themselfs as experts .."
"It feels like Anthony Davis has been in the NBA for 15 years, he's only like 27"
"The only argument for Conley over Anthony Davis is games played. It's a very good argument mind you. However when both are on the court, it's not even close who the better player is and who impacted their team more. Anthony Davis is clearly superior to Conley on both ends of the floor.  The Jazz would also have 3 allstars and so that's another knock on Conley unfortunately."
Who would you have instead of him? Anthony Davis?
Anthony Davis has not in any capacity dragged the Lakers to the third seed in the West. The Lakers are still LeBron's team first and foremost.
Anthony Davis? He’s at least been near MVP conversation these past couple years.
"Wait... Anthony Davis? He is injured and will not play why give him an all star? Is this common and I don't remember? I know some players get the Allstars and then get injured, but I don't remember the other way around.  Sad to not see Conley, Booker and Hayward... But I guess who would you remove right? Well I would say that Tatum is here because the respect he has more than his game this season. I know he is better than most player, but this season because of covid and other stuff has not really played that well."
"Personally would have had Sabonis over Simmons, but I guess Philly is #1 seed right now and Indiana is still in the Eastern Conference playoff swamp from seed 4-8, so I guess they want to reward the first seed with multiple ASG slots.   No Raptors is sad but honestly understandable. Would have been nice for FVV or Lowry to make it, but the slow start was pretty rough.  In the West, no Booker, DeRozen, and Conley are the notable ""snubs"" for me (not that the people who made it necessarily deserve it less). Anthony Davis is doubtful for the ASG, so one of them likely slots in. I'd love for DeMar to have made it, but IDK if he would even attend given the situation with his father. Booker is great and it wouldn't feel bad for Conley to make his first All Star appearance, so any of these three would be a good pick."
Lmao Anthony Davis made it? What a fucking joke.
"Zion has been playing great, he just needs to get more touched. I do think Anthony Davis will most likely not be playing in the actual all star game depending on how long the Lakers will keep him out, which probably means Booker is going to be stepping in"
"If you don't think Anthony Davis is a better player than Devin Booker, your fandom has blinded you."
"Anthony Davis. Even before his injury, he wasn’t at the level of the others so far this year."
Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis?  Seriously, dud has been injured / playing poorly more than he has played like an all star this year."
"Wrong. Per Yahoo,   Western Conference G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  FC: Anthony Davis  FC: Rudy Gobert  FC: Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: Paul George"

SGA for injury reserve for Anthony Davis
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"Book snubbed again.... “you gotta win”   Only as it pertains to the narratives they want, Zion is having a great year but peli’s are shit and Suns are 20-10.  He’s about to go off the rest of the year for being named a reserve as a replacement again likely bc of Anthony Davis..."
Nah I didn’t mind. We’re talking about Anthony Davis and I had seen enough out of Lonzo to know he’d never be an all-star.
"Yeah that seems reasonable. If they get traded, they revert to the standard max in both cap hit and actual payments.  I’d imagine you’d want that in place for other reasons as well - the goal is to reward teams for drafting guys who become superstars and keeping them in their markets. Trading them kind of defeats that.  Might also help prevent an Anthony Davis situation where they just blatantly force their way out early. Could also potentially investigate something like a poison pill where it makes little sense to trade for them.   So, say team A signs player X to a super max. It’s going to be hard to move them because trading to team B would not only mean player X gets paid less, but maybe the poison pill aspect is team B still has the full super max count against their cap (inverse to the original signing) or something like that.  I don’t have all the answers, just spitballing."
"I mean dude I will never understand why fans like yourself and many others are so okay with dudes teaming up like this. When I was younger it made me angry that Lebron left Cleveland for Miami, but dude the durant move is like 100x worse. The Harden trade is just a classic case of superstar Diva being ungrateful for a franchise that gave him everything. And then him demanding a trade only to brooklyn is just hilarious.  I understand Anthony Davis requested to be traded to LA but he was professional about it and had nothing bad to say about NOLA. Harden trashed every single person in the rockets organization possible by talking shit to the media and making their offseason and start to the season complete hell lol.  I really think NBA fans are a lot younger and they just want to see all the best players spread out between 3-4 teams. The reality is 90% the league has literally no chance of winning the title this year, and literally no one has an issue with that 😂"
Anthony Davis duh. He played over 80% of minutes at center that year too
i mean you requested a 3-requirement-statistic   &gt; second best player  &gt; championship team  &gt; same usage as AD  with a legitimate real-world equivalent  &gt; goran dragic: 27.3 USG  &gt; anthony davis: 27.2 USG  and now suddenly i'm the idiot because i didn't comb through the last 40 years of NBA Championship Rosters to find the second-best-player who was also injured in the season with a specifically 27.2% USG rate
"embiid, harden, kyrie, durant, jaylen brown, giannis, sabonis, lavine, butler, adebayo, trae young, vucevic, beal, luka, zion, ingram, mitchell, gobert, lillard, jokic, kahwhi, paul geroge, lebron, anthony davis, curry"
Tell the best player in the NBA to start winning games without Anthony Davis then
Anthony Davis went to the playoffs twice in New Orleans in 7 years. One of those times it was with cousins. Does this means Davis is unable to  play winning basketball?
"It's unfortunate that Kemba hasn't been the player they wanted, and they're having trouble moving him, but they need to continue to go for it.  If Kemba averaged his season totals from last year in the playoffs, they still lose to the Lakers handily.  Celtics need a real center/rim defender.  Brad Stevens is one of the best coaches in basketball and does a good job hiding his team's deficiencies, but come playoffs good squads wreck that shit up.  Had they gotten Anthony Davis, we wouldn't be having this conversation, which is also only partially their fault."
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"You can say “Keep in mind” but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his “LA or bust” thing wasn’t even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don’t really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn’t been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
Anthony Davis says hi.
"Trade LeBron, he's trash. Dude couldn't even lead the team to the playoffs until Anthony Davis showed up. He's being exposed again this season."
"While I do think AD has a case for best player, the Lakers have played well over the last two years with Lebron without AD on the floor. At first I thought this was satire, but now it seems like the comments that get made when the Lakers lose. Despite taking half the games off, he’s pretty clearly not just reliant on Anthony Davis."
"He’s just so constantly dinged up, I mean when I think of Anthony Davis it’s tough to not think of him getting up slowly hobbling around a little bit and going back to the locker room for a bit, it’s just tough for me to say this guy is a top 5 player when he’s constantly banged up. Top 5 talent no doubt but he needs more availability to be a top 5 player."
U know the lakers will have Anthony Davis back by the playoffs right
TLDR: Anthony Davis is valuable to his team.
"He's played 4 overtime games and is missing Anthony Davis, so yes he might average 4 more minutes a game this month than you want him to. Lebron is not going to die because he is playing 4 more minutes every night."
No. Defense was outstanding last season and the most Anthony Davis had been gone was like 2 weeks with a tailbone injury
He's also played 4 overtime games this month and is missing Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis expected to return prematurely in a couple days. LeBron chase for mvp is more important now.
"Small correction, Kawhi is a starter so Anthony Davis would be a backup forward. Your list is also my list except I have DeRozan over CP3."
G- Luka Doncic   G- Stephen Curry   F- LeBron James   F- Anthony Davis[INJ]  F- Nikola Jokic   Bench:  G- Damian Lillard   G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard   F- Paul George   F- Rudy Gobert  WC- Devin Booker   WC- Chris Paul  INJ-REP- Zion Williamson  The only player whom I think would miss out would be DeMar DeRozan
"Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Deandre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson, Tyler Herro, Gordon Hayward... ALL on my fantasy team."
Anthony Davis alone is better than the entire Cavs team outside of Lebron
I really think this win gets both of them in. Worse case Anthony Davis gets the allstar nod then one of the suns guys gets the injury replacement.
"Wade, Kyrie and Anthony Davis, Wade is the greatest player he played with that was still great at the time (Sorry Shaq), Kyrie is the most skilled and Anthony Davis is the best physical Talent and best on both ends of court"
"&gt; The average value of an NBA team has increased by more than 6 fold in the past 10 years - no other major sports league is anywhere close to that in the same time span. TV ratings don't account for live streams, fans watching highlights on youtube, or fans that mostly follow the media circus behind the NBA.   It's weird that you talk about team valuations, and then list stuff that can't be monetized by the league/teams, like illegal streams and youtube clips, and thus don't contribute to a team's value.   At the same time you discount the importance of ratings, which are how the NBA actually makes its money. TNT and ESPN don't care how many Streamable clips of NBA players you watch, or TMZ stories about their off-court drama you read - none of those bring viewers to TNT/ESPN, and without viewers those networks can't charge the advertising rates that allow them to pay the NBA's bills.   &gt; don't trick yourself into thinking that Adam Silver is losing sleep at night over the league's refereeing, because of Nielsen Ratings lol.  If that were true, then why has Silver acted in ways to shore up sagging ratings?   Why did the NBA prohibit teams from resting players for load management during nationally-televised games, and blacklist the term ""load management,"" if Silver doesn't care about TV ratings?   Why did the NBA force the Pelicans to play Anthony Davis, if Silver doesn't care about TV ratings?   Why is the NBA adamant about having All-Star Weekend this year, if Silver doesn't care about TV ratings?   Why does the NBA schedule Lebron in the prime Christmas game every year, if Silver doesn't care about TV ratings?   Why is the NBA considering mid-season tournaments, if Silver doesn't care about TV ratings? He literally said: ""Games that are meaningful are **more likely to draw ratings.** Not to say [the in-season tournament] is a permanent change, but let’s try this.""   Sure seems like a league/commish who cares about TV ratings to me."
"Even I hate that sub but idiots coming there and expecting level-headed takes are kidding themselves.  Especially funny when it's coming from a Heat flair whose sub spent the finals relentlessly shitting on Bron and the same exact sentiment he just commented while even fucking /r/lakers had top posts like prayers for Goran/Bam/Butlers recovery after game 1, comments always praising Jimmy for balling out and dueling with LeBron, accepting that loss as the team's fault when DG missed and Kief choked. Even until now casuals think that Lakers only won because of luck as if that Heat team was ever gonna beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis playing like they did.  Even until now if Lakers and Nuggets play and you visit their sub, they still bitch about losing the series because refs apparently are out to fuck Jokic and Murray. Blazers fans do the same shit to a lesser extent. Hilarious that infamously salty Rockets fans are the only fanbase from our opponents last playoffs where I've barely heard shit like that. They acknowledge their team's shortcomings"
&gt; “The @Lakers really miss Anthony Davis and Dennis Schröder because they affect the **g**ame on both ends of the court.”  G is obviously for giannis.
"Lmao. If you think putting an entire game on one single player (who is efficiently scoring over 25 with 9 rebounds and 8 assists) is how basketball works then good for you. No shit the Lakers are worse without Anthony Davis, a top 10 player who eats up 35% of their cap. This has nothing to do with LeBron."
"In this scenario, LeBron wouldn’t have arguments over Damian and Curry other than having good stats at 36 y/o. If Anthony Davis misses the remaining of the season and the Lakers still manage to get the 3rd seed, then LeBron would have an argument imo"
"What are you talking about? According to the first half season SoS Lakers were 29th which is actually the second easiest in the league while clippers were 20th. Second half of the season they’ll be 5th in SoS, which without Anthony Davis is where the losses will roll in. Without Anthony Davis you’re getting pushed to overtime against the pistons and thunder lol. Clippers have had to face teams like Jazz and heat without their superstars."
Anthony day-to-Davis
Assuming full health:  John Wall  Victor Oladipo   Kawhi Leonard  Bam Adebayo   Anthony Davis
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12. Paul George 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Yeah I know I know Joker too high..... stay sleep man.
"It’s the regular season, and they don’t have anthony davis"
By OPs logic Anthony davis is a “clown” for load managing
"Hmmm let me say it again, Anthony Davis is out. Do you really think Lebron would be trying to carry the load as much when AD is available?"
On the flip side of things...   You guys have developed 27-year-old Anthony Davis. lol. I mean he's not a young guy anymore by any means but Lebron is forcing that dude to be more vocal and aggressive and a louder teammate.  That's kind of essential if he's going to be the face of your franchise in a few years.
Deandre Jordan gonna guard Anthony Davis? 😂 that’s a MISMATCH in the making for the finals
"Anthony Davis is averaging close to post-rookie career-lows almost across the board, and no one knows when or if he will play again this season.  How is that ""Doing great""?"
"Anthony Davis, Embiid, and Brown have been doing great almost every season  And Jones has consistently been a major rotation player"
Yeah and maybe if the season doesn’t shut down for 5 months anthony davis has his yearly injury and you don’t win a championship. It didn’t go down like that. Russ was complete trash in the playoffs and basically always is
&gt;Zion would be getting all star votes would happen regardless.  *Mhmmmmmmmmm.*  How many All-Stars did Anthony Davis miss?  Just his rookie year.
But the intangibles! But potential! But the metrics! But you can’t teach size! But he’s a good kid!   He looks like Glen Big Baby Davis and hustles like Anthony Bennett.
"Better than the Pelicans, a franchise that was notoriously known in the league as the team with the shittiest medical staff before Griff took over. Literally a five year period where the Pelicans ranked top five in games lost to injury, during a period where 21-25 yo AD could’ve vaulted y’all into consistent playoff contention if he and his teammates weren’t routinely banged up. Do us all a favor and shut the fuck up.  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/nba-insider-tom-haberstroh/how-pelicans-failed-anthony-davis"
"It really depends on Anthony Davis.   If he comes back healthy the lakers will win. If he doesn't, we'll they may struggle.  It's his team and they'll go where he goes."
"I think this is where Philly is still somewhat weak.   They need Embiid to do so much and his game isn't built around having any easy possessions. He has to insanely hard on both ends and in the playoffs that hasn't been super sustainable.   Strength and weight don't scale proportionally. That means fatigue is a huge factor for modern centers in a cardio centric league.  Compare him to other bigs who have had long successful playoff runs:  * Anthony Davis has a lot of easy buckets in his diet because he's so good off-ball, he lets other guys (Rondo, LeBron, etc) do the heavy-lifting for him in terms of playmaking - Embiid scores by throwing +250lb defenders around.  * Jokic takes a lot of plays off by not playing defence which lets him conserve energy for his offence - Embiid anchors the 76ers' defence.     Last playoffs we saw:  1. Embiid sagging back a lot on PnRs to try and conserve energy, which is a disaster against any team that can pull-up and shoot.  2. Embiid falling apart in the 2nd half.   Now obviously, Ben wasn't there and Embiid looks like he's in better shape, but it's still a problem they're going to have.   The 76ers are playing a lot better now, but Embiid really needs the other guys to step up to take some off that pressure off.   * Simmons is still a question mark in the playoffs * Curry has returned to earth as a scorer  * Tobias has never averaged 16ppg in the playoffs * Maxey is promising but too young for Embiid's prime most likely * Green is unreliable as hell   That's why I liked them trading Green + Maxey + Scott for Lowry when it looked like he'd be available. They could use his leadership to supplement Embiid's."

Yeah because the Lakers had a PERFECT bill of health before LeBron came. Julius Randle didn’t break his leg in his first career game or nothing. Anthony Davis isn’t sitting on a dangerously hurt Achilles or nothing huh bruh?? Sit’cho dumbass down somewhere before you ever try and talk to da god
So a team with Anthony Davis and Lebron James fresh off winning a title ain’t a favorite?
I’m pretty sure Anthony Davis already did that
"yea and he missed the playoffs before they traded everything for Anthony Davis. If you don't think Lebron's contract length, the lakers missing the playoffs, and their AD trade have anything to do with each other I don't know what to tell you"
I mean it’s pretty fair to say that people didn’t expect Anthony Davis to coast and then get an injury putting him out for a month.
"&gt; Having 37yo LeBron playing 37 minutes a night and hero ball to the W is not a good strategy.   True, the Lakers should really rethink Anthony Davis’ injury, clearly not a winning strategy imo."
"The best player, not their best player.   Anthony Davis has been the best player injured out of all the injuries between Boston, Miami, Denver and LA."
"Nah been watching hoops since 04’ ,i just completely forgot he was on that Anthony Davis squad."
"Getting Drummond or Whiteside would obviously be perfect, but imo it’s unlikely we can acquire them.   The front office will try their best, but lots of contending teams are looking for a center right now.  I don’t think we should trade away any major assets to acquire a starting-caliber center, since we’re still winning most games without Anthony Davis, who will likely play center in the playoffs.  If we signed him, Damion Jones would be playing very few minutes as the 4th option behind AD, Trez, and Gasol. He would be fine for that role, and allow us to focus on acquiring a 3&amp;D shooter."
To even warrant being in the discussion? What?  He has his team 3rd in the West and is leading the best defense in the NBA without Anthony Davis  How does that not warrant being in the discussion?
Horford was the absolute leader of a 60-22 Atlanta Hawks team. Was he a better player than Anthony Davis?
"Sure thing, welcome home Anthony Davis"
"Alex Caruso is wearing Hall of Famer AD's #4 with the Lakers.  Adrian Dantley, not Anthony Davis."
good thing they have that guy anthony davis for the playoffs
Isn’t Anthony Davis supposed to be the best defender in the NBA? If the lakers lost him and their defense didn’t get worse it’s almost like there’s millions of things that contribute to that. Unless AD isn’t actually a dpoy?
Anthony Davis doing his best man. He's just injured.
"That would be Anthony Davis, most valuable injured player  Or Klay, minimum 30 games unplayed requirement"
"It's a weird season with a wide open race, so something weird could happen, but Lebron really doesn't have a traditional MVP pedigree.   Since 2009, every MVP has led the league in PER except 2011 Derrick Rose and 2015 Stephen Curry. Lebron probably should have won MVP over Rose in 2011, and in 2015, Curry was 3rd in PER behind Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook, but those guys both missed double digit games, and Curry was on a 67-win team, while Davis was on the 8th seed, and Westbrook missed the playoffs.  Right now Lebron is 16th in PER.  Similarly, every MVP since 2009 except 2011 Rose and 2017 Westbrook have led the league in WS/48. Lebron is currently ranked 21st in this.  Not saying these stats are the end all, be all, but not being on a top seed, while being nowhere close to the top of some stats that the MVP is usually the leader in isn't a good sign for Lebron's MVP case.  With that said, Embiid is injured right now. No one in the media wants to give it to Giannis, Harden has the Houston situation and also his stats are less glamarous than usual (although he has a weird media thrust behind him), and Jokic/Butler/Curry/Lillard all have team record problems that will hurt their case, although for Jokic an Butler that might not be the case at the end of the season (don't think it's as likely for the Blazers/Warriors to make a run towards the top of the standings in the second half)."
Whenever I argued last year that Anthony Davis was a better defender than Giannis last year and should have won DPOY over him this was one of the main responses I got
Lebron is averaging 26/8/8 with a better record than the Nuggets. While missing Anthony Davis. And he’s playing vastly superior defense to Jokic. I hear more people acting like LeBron being near the top of the MVP race being a charity case than anything from pro-Lebron people. It’s getting ridiculous at this point.
Anthony Davis
"&gt;Dray isn't a net positive on offense  That's not even close to accurate. Dude isn't averaging 9apg by being bad at offense, he's doing it by blowing up 4 on 3s whenever Curry draws doubles, as he has for years. That's why Kerr is so diligent about keeping them on the floor together (even moreso then his defense). GSW as a whole and Curry's own splits with/without Draymond back this up, going back several years.  &gt;oubre and wiggins do get staggered.  Oubre plays more than 80% of his minutes with Curry. Contrast with players like Kyle Lowry and Donovan Mitchell, or to a lesser extent Anthony Davis and CJ McCollum, who all played somewhere from 55% to 68% of their minutes with their team's top player this year or last year -- that's what staggering looks like. No wonder Curry's on/offs look better than LeBron's or Dame's when their 2nd best player is on the court most of the time they're off of it, while Curry plays with his best teammates 96% and 81% of the time."
"Kawhi Leonard, I do find his dry way of interviewing to be hilarious at times, he let his personality whether it was intentional or not show a little bit starting in Toronto but I do not find his game enjoyable to watch even though I respect the skill           Anthony Davis and James Harden as well, again I respect the talent, respect the skill just certain things about their game don't translate to me as far as being entertaining"
Anthony Davis
If Anthony Davis is healthy I don't think anyone can beat the Lakers.
"A few of CloraPando's last posts  ""Perk floats the possiblity of the Steph Curry to the Lakers""  ""Frank Vogel says Lakers are ‘excited’ for Anthony Davis to return""  ""Report: Analyst suggests Lakers are best fit for LaMarcus Aldridge"""
100% hit the nail on the head. Anthony Davis at the rim/playing safety and Lebron playing safety over the course of a 7 game series is just so hard to deal with for an offense. Add the fact that they are both really high IQ defenders with elite reaction time just makes it unfair when they are both locked in.
Have we forgotten about Anthony Davis?
"Yes but not actually. There's far more of a gap if you've ever seen them in the floor together  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/7/6/21314643/frank-vogel-lebron-james-anthony-davis-wants-lakers-dominate-orlando  Just look at that first photo, is AD on a platform? Cuz thats like a 3 inch difference.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1219176-2012-nba-finals-lebron-james-versus-kevin-durant-is-just-what-the-nba-needs  Or that one of KD and Bron, I've seen an inch difference and that ain't it"
"In no particular order:  1.	Lebron 2.	KD 3.	Harden 4.	Kawhi 5.	Giannis 6.	Anthony Davis 7.	Joel Embid 8.	Steph Curry 9.	Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Paul George 12. Chris Paul 13. Luka Doncic 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Not sure if I missed anyone, but are all better and most are a tier above Tatum. Tatum is solidly in 16-20."
comparing steph curry to kyrie irving and anthony davis is laughable imo
CP3/Jr Smith/Zion/David West/Anthony Davis
"He absolutely cannot be the 2nd star on a title team. A 2nd star on a title team is a Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Steph Curry, ... not a Paul George."
"God damn you’re being overly stubborn and dense on this. But let me back it up again with stats.  Out of the top 25 all time free throw attempts in one game, harden has 1. Anthony Davis has 2. Lebron has 1.  “All the time” is only in your head."
"Right but you’re missing the point. It’s one game you’re talking about. You can’t use outliers like it’s the norm.  Anthony Davis had 27 free throw attempts in a game in 2019, 2 more than harden had in any game that year. So if using your logic, then we should be terrified of the Lakers for getting too many calls.  Don’t let bias and one-offs cloud real stats."
"This makes no sense. Anthony Davis was a first option on a .500 team lol, he just won a ring cause he played with LeBron. Jaylen Brown absolutely has potential to be a 2nd option. Look at Siakam and Lowry with the Raptors, he can play at that level. AD isn’t the benchmark"
"&gt; Jaylen Brown has all of the attributes to be a secondary player on a championship team  Reality check for you though: Jaylen Brown is currently the second best player on a .500 team. He's an All Star and is obviously a very good player, but I mean, Anthony Davis was the second best player on last year's title team, and there's a pretty significant difference between AD and Jaylen Brown."
The lakers without Anthony Davis is a 2nd round exit team. But Nets without Durant of Snake is still a finals team. I'll leave it at that.
Anthony Davis for Stephen Curry. Who says no?   Warriors get a 28-year old AD locked into a long term contract.  Lakers get a 33-year old Stephen Curry that is more likely to help them contend in the short term to maximize Lebron's contention window.
Anthony Month-to-Davis.
"Because his stats aren't good enough. He's 12th in PER right now, which won't cut it for MVP. The last MVP winner to not lead the league in PER was Curry during the 14-15 season, and that one was a special exception because the two people ahead of him, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook missed 14/15 games each, and AD was on the 8th seed while Westbrook missed the playoffs."
PG: Chris Paul  SG: JR Smith  SF: Zion Williamson  PF: David West  C: Anthony Davis  I had to do a little positional flexibility
"Lol this isn’t even related to the original comment.  He’s 28 now, you’re (in this hypothetical) not trading him now “while his value is highest” because you’d be fired for trading Anthony fuckin Davis 6 months after winning a championship. The excuse you’d have as you pack your shit would be “well 4 years from now I don’t think we should pay him”.   Really? Ok. You got it.  Oh, and the answer to the max contract question is “yes”. Don’t be obtuse just bc you think it would be some savvy GM move to trade a superstar one year into his deal. This ain’t 2k."
"every stat except One but sorry, you really proved ur point king! LeBron may have been behind in:  Points  Blocks  Team Record Box On/Off  Rebounds  FG%  Defensive Win Share  TS%    but Giannis was behind in assists (*with anthony davis as a teammate btw) so clearly there was definitely a reason for ESPN to talk about LeBron having a chance every day  Should not have used literally now my entire argument is invalid and LeBron definitely deserved to be in the conversation"
"On a similar note, Nerlens Noel is fourth in the league in blocks per game, averaging 2.0 a game despite only playing 22.2 MPG, which puts him at 157th in minutes per game. He is second in the league in block percentage with 8.9% (behind Myles Turner) and third in the league in defensive rating with 102.4 (behind Rudy Gobert and Anthony Davis)."
Anthony Davis shoots below 30% and doesn’t even make one a game
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
&gt; if lakers ever plan to keep him long term  [Well boy do I have some news for you...](https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-to-re-sign-with-lakers-on-5-year-deal)
Is Anthony Day-to-Davis back on the menu???
He's a scrub since he couldnt use black magic to heal Anthony Davis
"&gt; Don't forget Butler has been rising steadily in terms of stats and doesn't look likely to slow down anytime soon.  Out of his last ten games *two* were against teams with a win% higher than .500. This season he has played seven games against teams that are currently .500 or higher, and against those teams he has an average BPM of... 3.2. So no, I disagree that the numbers of his recent games (which still fall short of the basic averages of other MVP candidates) are bound to continue.  &gt; Nobody is saying they'd vote Butler if the season ended today.  I responded to someone saying he should be a candidate. Someone else has said he is a top 8 candidate.  Once again:  * He has missed 14 games so far * He falls significantly short of other candidates on basic metrics that yes, are *not* advanced, and are *not* the full picture, but nontheless MVP voting has generally followed in the last five years.  It would be unprecedented on *multiple* levels if he were to receive significant votes. It would be so unprecedented basketball-reference doesn't even list him in their tracker, which goes down to Rudy Gobert at 1.6%. Here are some players that an unnamed betting exchange valued at over $2 billion has listed as *more likely* to win MVP this season:  * Jaylen Brown * Domantas Sabonis * Kyrie Irving * Bradley Beal * Jayson Tatum * Anthony Davis * Devin Booker  If your argument for 'serious consideration' is 'But what if?' then I can throw up hypotheticals for, say, Julius Randle (he has a higher VORP! They have an easier schedule ahead! Not missed a game yet!) and the whole thing can be meaningless."
"&gt; W vs Lakers 114-89, No Anthony Davis, but it was a blowout  this is surely an another way to say ""Jared Dudley played 14 minutes and entered in a 1st quarter"""
Everybody so focused on Anthony Davis not realizing this dude been out for a while.
Other than LeBron and Giannis (since thats very obvious):  \- 5 Anthony Davis  \- 5 Draymond Greens (2015-16 peak)  \- 5 Kevin Garnetts
"How is he not proving it now? They had one of the best records in the league when Anthony Davis was playing. I really think you just hate LeBron because it’s absurd to think player rankings just reset after every playoffs. In that case, Durant is a scrub and everything he’s done in the last decade should be ignored since he didn’t play last year. Your logic is heavily flawed."
Worked out pretty well for Anthony Davis tbh.
here’s mine : LeBron James. 02 Kevin Durant 03 Giannis Antetokounmpo. 04 Stephen Curry 05 James Harden 06 Kawhi Leonard 07 Anthony Davis. 08 Luka Doncic. 09 Kyrie Irving 10 Jayson Tatum 11 Paul George 12 Jimmy Butler 13 Embiid 14 Jokic 15 KAT (may be a hot take) 16 Lillard 17 Gobert 18 Mitchell 19 Devin Booker 20 Chris Paul 21 Bradley Beal 22 Adebayo 23 Murray 24 Vuc 25 Young

"I'm ad I'm not the only one that noticed, but she looks like Anthony Davis in the face"
Anthony Davis and Lebron James
One of these refs looks like female Anthony Davis
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Give me Anthony Davis as my first option Nd probably KD/LeBron as my second option just being realistic...I was tryna find another center but the only person I could think of was PointGaurd Jokic but he would get embarrassed on the defensive end
"&gt; Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?   So you love these defensive stats when they favour Lebron but discount them for Jokic? DBPM, D-PIPM, D-RAPTOR. Basically any defensive advanced stat paints Jokic as a very clear positive defensive player. Yet you call him atrocious.  &gt; Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.   Probably, although I could see Philly falling off a bit while he is out and then surging when he comes back helping the narrative on his case.   &gt; The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.   Yeah I mean if the best argument against Giannis is ""he's already won it"" maybe we should look at his actual stats.  &gt; So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes?   IMO no, I'd probably have him second or third on my ballot right now (with the exclusion of Embiid).  &gt; Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   Firstly, what does year in year out have to do with MVP? Its this years award. Secondly, I dont really love on/off anyway because it doesn't really quantify anything other than how bad your replacement(s) is/are, but regardless all these guys have amazing on/off numbers, they are MVP candidates. Embiid +17, Lebron +11, Giannis +11, Kawhi +14 even Jokic has a +6 despite an incredibly strong bench unit on his team etc."
"Porzingis takes go from ""Knicks won the trade because they didn't have to pay him"" to apparently ""maybe fucking Anthony Davis is better"". Quite interesting."
30/30 AD  Either Drummond or Anthony Davis works
"Is Jokic in the lead at the 6th seed with his atrocious defensive play?  Embiid missing the better part of a month will likely end his bid in addition to his 7 missed games.  Luka is the 8th seed.  Steph isn't even in the playoffs right now.  The voters will have fatigue and not vote Giannis because of his post-season failures, and Milwaukee whom I believe won't get the first seed which would be his only shot.  James Harden has his Houston mess which will turn off voters in addition to being apart of a superteam roster with 34 combined allstar appearances.  So LeBron, who has a great record without Anthony Davis, is ranked at the top of multiple defensive metrics, which Patty Mills and Rudy Gay are not, should be the in the lead yes? Poised to keep winning games without Anthony Davis for another 3 weeks.   Also, LeBron consistently posts some of the best on/off court stats in the league year in and year out.   How do you *not* make the case LeBron is the favorite and in the lead right now?"
"They could've had a better back up plan. I know they were going for Giannis but even that was a long shot. They could have moved players like Powell or Lowry who'll they'll now have to rush to move or get nothing back when they'll walk. Or in Powell's case are going to have to give up a ton of cap space for a sixth man.  At least when the Celtics lost Kyrie, they picked up Kemba immediately. The Pelicans only moved Anthony Davis once they were guaranteed Zion. Even the Thunder got Paul George and Carmelo a season after Durant left. The Raptors have done nothing but lose their championship identity each season with no replacement even for their role players."
Yeah but the Nuggets have had zero games with Anthony Davis.
Anthony “Day-To-Traeger” Davis
"There's a massive difference between saying that stats are misleading and saying that stats don't matter. Looking at TS% and PPG randomly would make you believe that Anthony Davis is the 2nd greatest playoff scorer to Michael Jordan, which is untrue, however ignoring stats would mean that you wouldn't recognize Davis as a great scorer at all.  Looking at stats without any context would land you at thinking that LeBron James is as good as a scorer as Kevin Durant or that Karl Malone was a better scorer than Kobe Bryant and Larry Bird, which are asinine thoughts and the reason you have to actually THINK and watch the games before making a stupid conclusion."
"I love how i say that stats are misleading and the nephew falls straight into the trap of talking about volume and efficiency. It's all about PPG then? Ok, so Allen Iverson is the 2nd greatest playoff scorer of all time and i don't wanna hear anything about it.  Oh, it's about efficiency and scoring then? Ok, Anthony Davis is a greater playoff scorer than Steph, Kobe, Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'fucking Neal, Kareem and LeBron himself.  See how stupid your argument sounds? Lol"
"True, I’m going to get hate for this but I think Anthony Davis is so overrated by the virtue of him being unable to go prolonged periods of time without being injured."
"If Utah ends up with best record by far, it seems many people will not want to only give them one player in the 3rd team. League leader in points per game has always been, as I remember, always at the lowest 2nd team All-NBA, but I think Beal's situation my be an exception. So I think Kyrie, Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Beal all are close. I guess I could bet on Beal because he probably has the least of ""shared vote"" with others.  Paul George has a great season, I think he'd be there. Also they can count Anthony Davis as forward I think, last season it was totally possible so why not now, he could get votes over any non-star players. With the missed time he might miss it anyway though, because Jimmy Butler is playing fantastic.   These are the doubts I'd say, the other guys in this list are basically sure bets to be All-NBA."
"Wow, Jokic has .4 more playoff VORP than Anthony Davis. In New Orleans AD played in 3 playoff series; he played Golden State in 2 of them. Jokic is **supposed** to have more playoff VORP than AD. And this is on top of the fact that VORP is a box score metric that overvalues offense as opposed to defense.  Furthermore, the Lakers won with defense NOT offense. AD had the most dominant defensive performance in the playoffs of the last decade (outside of maybe Draymond Green) and still put up 28-10 on 67 TS%. If you replaced AD with Jokic, the Lakers get worse because their defense gets horrifically worse."
"&gt;Also: LOL at the implication that Jokic was responsible for Dame playing like crap.  I didnt imply any of that, i just think that it's not this foregone conclusion that jokic gets cooked every playoffs, as proved by his tremendous playoff career that already has more career playoff VoRP than anthony davis  LOL! if jokic played with fucking Lebron he'd have a title too"
Gobert alone is not doing shit. Anthony Davis is a terrible matchup for him
"Anthony Davis is allowing 63.4% at the rim this year. Gobert is allowing 60.8. Embiid is 60.3.   **When people get to the rim, they score.** Even against Davis and Gobert.  I think a lot of people are looking at this number and thinking Embiid and Gobert are holding people in the 40s--the biggest part of defense is keeping people out of the restricted area in the first place.  Jokic is bad at rim protection, but it's just one component of defenses, and he's good at every other part of big man defense.   From 2015-2020 the Nuggets have had a better team Defensive rating with Jokic ON the floor than off. If he was such a generationally bad defender i dont see how this could be the case for a literal half-decade  People hate defensive analytics, but Jokic is the only ""bad"" defender they constantly rate above his reputation. Kevin Love doesnt overperform. Amare didnt. KAT doesnt.   Add on top of this a half-decade of his team being better at defense when he's on the court than off, and I'm sorry, he's not a terrible defender"
"Bro you're giving the arguable GOAT, and fucking Anthony Davis, plus Steph??? The Lakers have a very good bench also. Nets are fucked no matter what non all star they add"
"&gt; And although he's having an MVP season he consistently has a noticeable drop in scoring and efficiency.  &gt; 2019-20  &gt; Regular Season: 30/8/4  &gt; Postseason: 24/4/4   Hmmm, I dunno OP,  maybe this dropoff has to do with the fact that he Blazers were the 8 seed and ran into the one of the top teams and defenses in the league in the first round in the Lakers.  Like you're comparing 5 games vs the #1 team in the league, vs 70 games vs every team in the league. Why WOULDN'T Dame average better stats against the Timberwolves, Kings, and Cavs than a Lakers team with borderline DPOY Anthony Davis.   These stats are a great example though of why basketball reference nerds and fans who follow NBA through wikipedia instead of watching the game have no idea what they're talking about a lot of times."
"Anthony Davis allows a 63.7 FG% within 6 feet, and Jokic allows a 63.5 FG% within 6 feet. Make of that what you will."
If in the playoffs Anthony Davis was playing 5 feet off Westbrook every poss letting him shoot then brook Lopez and his concrete feet shouldn’t be in the same zip code as RW on that switch
so anthony davis?
Anthony Davis with blocks
"The way I've always viewed KAT's game is that he's a PF that happens to have the body of a center.  Though unlike Anthony Davis, who became an elite switchable defender at the 4/5, KAT turned out to be something of a tweener at that end and probably wouldn't have ever developed into an impact defender such as AD/Giannis/Gobert no matter what scheme he'd been put in."
"Here's a list you could argue for being ahead of him: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER)  1. Luka 2. LeBron 3. Giannis 4. Steph 5. Jokic 6. Embiid 7. Kawhi 8. Paul George 9. Kyrie 10. Lillard 11. Harden 12. Durant 13. Anthony Davis 14. Beal 15. Gobert 16. Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Ben Simmons 19. Devin Booker 20. Karl Anthony Towns 21. Zach Lavine  &amp;#x200B;  That's all I could come up with. I think I would personally put Tatum ahead of 3-5 guys on this list, so he'd be in the 15-17 range for me."
Anthony Davis
"&gt; The Lakers are plus-9.1 per 100 possessions with James on the floor, and minus-4.4 when he rests. That sustained during the Lakers' slide without Anthony Davis; the Lakers are plus-20 with James on the floor since Davis went on the shelf, and minus-31 with James on the bench, per NBA.com   They're way ahead of you pal, we got net rating now"
"Without Anthony Davis, I rank the West conference teams as:  1) Clippers 2) Suns 3) Nuggets 4) Jazz 5) Blazers 6) Lakers 7) Warriors 8) Spurs 9) Mavs 10) Grizzlies 11) Thunder 12) Kings 13) Pelicans 14) TWolves 15) Rockets"
"Sweet, now on my fantasy team the only guys I have hurt/not playing are: Embiid, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Malik Beasley, DeAndre Hunter, Mitchell Robinson and David Bertans."
"Being better at creating your own shot isn’t really relevant when your production is similar. Nobody would think Tobias is a better scorer than Klay Thompson or Anthony Davis for example. Production matters more than “how does he get his points”  He‘s almost certainly not a better defender, so that really just leaves rebounding"
"Anthony Davis will save them, he’ll be back at end of March"
Ahh yes. Anthony Davis who had Rich Paul publicly admit that AD would be a 1 year rental if the Celtics tried to outbid the Lakers.
"This is my take:  First Round-  Jazz beat Mavs in 6,   Suns beat Spurs in 5,   Lakers beat Blazers in 5,   Clippers beat Nuggets in 7,   Hawks beat 76ers in 7,   Nets sweep Knicks in 4, Bucks beat Hornets in 5,   Celtics beat Heat in 7.  2nd Round-   Clippers beat Jazz in 6,   Lakers beat Suns in 6,   Nets beat Bucks in 7,   Celtics beat Hawks in 6,  Conference Finals-   Lakers beat Clippers in 7,   Nets beat Celtics in 6,  Finals- Lakers beat Nets in 7  I think healthy Lakers team will beat anyone. Anthony Davis and Lebron are unstoppable when at 100%. No team has the size to matchup up against them defensively. My hot take is the Hawks upsetting 76ers first round, I think Capela is the only defender this year I have seen capable of stopping Embiid. Hawks beat 76ers by 15+ pts last time they played"
"Bro Anthony Davis &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kyrie. Giannis has Middleton and Jrue. Kawhi has PG. I don’t think Harden should win, but he’s in the discussion. Especially once KD is back it’s over. But harden has only played like 5 games with both Kyrie and KD. Also Joe Harris? Yes that’s what happens when you let one of the best guys ever at making mediocre 3P shooters look good get an actual sniper."
"In recent years the following players were available via trade: Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Paul George, James Harden and Jimmy Butler. Ainge was generally thought of to have the most trade assets/best trade package possible and got none of them. That's pretty telling. That's what the guy you responded to meant."
Ah yes Anthony Davis that would have certainly required Tatum or Brown+ for a guy that said he wouldnt resign with anyone except LA. Same bullshit with Kawhi.  total fleeces man
If anthony davis is back he is gonna regress again.
"&gt; Multiple all-nba is exceeding expectations as a #1 pick.  Let's see how many #1 picks have 2 all-nba team selections or more.

Maybe Anthony Davis trade? No idea I just remember they are on the running.
not only is Anthony Davis out tonight apparently so is shrooder
Anthony week-to-week Davis /s
He was said to be reevaluated in 2 weeks the time he got injured too.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30907057/source-los-angeles-lakers-star-anthony-davis-re-evaluated-2-3-weeks
there were plenty of people advocating for derrick williams.  it wasn't like with anthony davis.
"More context:   Anthony Davis has ""been cleared to enter the next phase of his return to play process,"" per the Lakers, after being seen by team doctors tonight. He'll be re-evaluated in two weeks, per the team.  https://twitter.com/mcten/status/1370580502504042496"
"1) Short off season.  Like Anthony Davis and LeBron, Butler who had the longest campaigns all suffered injuries.  2) Less days off between games.  Also the lack of real proper recovery.  Instead of normal travel you have to deal with covid protocol eating into down time.  3) Lockdown in a hotel preventing proper treatment."
"Coz he  played 3 games of college ball.many were unable to find so many holes in his game.  He made some mistakes in those 3 games as well.  People projected that he is going to be anthony davis, Garnett, David Robinson type of player.   On side note warriors sub is kinda crazy for its own fans lol it seems like there is atleast 1 guy per day saying stuff like bandwagons and stuff and act like they suffered like stfu u watched a game"
same place as the dunk where he postered Anthony Davis
Wiseman was making the same mistakes he is making now in his 3 college games.  Him only playing 3 games helped his stock alot and gave people this David Robinson Anthony davis type hype somehow
Anthony Davis or Luka
That guy Anthony Davis when he’s healthy. That guy ZIon on your team
".. he's not wing like at all. He's heavy footed, not quick laterally and not a quick leaper. He has a bunch of skills he's drilled to pretend like he's Anthony Davis but when he plays in games that matter, he gets stopped easily.  You know how rookie Embiid always had good feet, awareness and coordination so even when he screws up, you can see promise? Wiseman has none of that.  His stats ""look good"" for a rookie but so did Marvin Bagley's and Bagley is way more talented than Wiseman."
“That fan base” for booing Anthony Davis
"Because that's not the team that was in the playoffs. Their top 9 guys in the playoffs were:  - Anthony Davis  - LeBron James  - Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  - Danny Green  - Alex Caruso  - Kyle Kuzma  - Rajon Rondo  - Markieff Morris  - Dwight Howard  Everyone is a positive defender, no one is an easy target to isolate on. And then two top 5 players carrying the load, including AD who had one of the best playoff runs of all time. The expression ""you're as weak as your weakest rotational player"" really confirms that they were a solid team.   But, on the other hand, the playoff competition in general wasn't that great last year."
Anthony Davis would like a word
Anthony Davis literally looks like the Chicago bull
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
"Well, maybe Aaron Nelson's staff can get him right. But side note, if we're trying to collect players that will invariably piss Rajon Rondo/Anthony Davis/DeMarcus Cousins (I think IT and Cousins are cool with each other) off, we need to go hog wild and get Chris Paul.         Also, wonder if any of the ex-Lakers who were his teammates in Los Angeles, vouched for him."
You don’t need 3 guys who can carry an offense. Ideally you’d have two and more defensive pieces around them or even one if they’re as good as someone lebron and have Anthony Davis.  Also Miami only had two of those guys and wa s not a super team

"They hated Jesus for telling the truth too.   Kawhi's defense has fallen off a bit the past few years. He was at a level like Scottie Pippen a few years back, crazy to watch. Now he's good and can be great in bursts but due to either injuries, increased effort on the offensive end, or both he's not what he was these days. He's never been a top ten offensive player, his defense made him a household name, so with that going down a bit there is no argument that he's better than LeBron, Giannis, Harden, Durant, Steph Curry - I could name others I think he's below but these five shouldn't be controversial. To me he's about Anthony Davis level at this point which isn't bad but it's not where he was and not top 5."
"&gt;Ur actually stupid af.  Cool. What are your intellectual credentials? Let's hear them. Your ability to spell is at about a 4th grade level, so you're already struggling.     &gt; Sure every team technically can sign free agents, but which teams actually do, meaning which free agents are interested in signing there. The Celtics have had multiple all star free agents go there. Also, you've just picked an arbitrary point of only mvps, look at all the all stars the celtics and signed and get back to me u mentally reduced punk.   I already told you that average teams ACTUALLY sign fringe All-Stars, derelict. At inflated prices. Gordon Hayward signed with the Charlotte Hornets this offseason. That's not big market, that's normal.  The big market advantage is getting free MVP-level players. Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant.  Now tell me how many free MVP's have forced their way to Boston."
"I gave up reading Deadspin after the Anthony Davis trade saga where they couldn’t seem to understand that since Davis was under contract, the Pelicans had the right to trade him as they pleased. And that’s before their Zion takes after the lottery."
the Anthony Davis game winner in the playoffs last year definitely comes to mind
Anthony Davis is a historically great college defender. No one in the last ten years has even come close to his defensive impact in college statistically or just plain eye test.
"My bad, was responding a couple of posts above to  u/inshamblesx about this offseason. My comment got lost in the overall thread.  I don't disagree he's inefficient, but some of that in Charlotte can be chalked up to his best teammate being who? Nic Batum, Dwight Howard, and Al Jefferson? Those Charlotte teams he had ZERO help so of course he's going to be a volume guy (a lot like Beal is right now, except Beal is a better scorer). This year I kind of blame the injury, as he's having his worst shooting year since 2014-15. I mean, could he be regressing back to that? Sure, but part of it has to do with the knee and him being less quick to his spots. He was an iron man in Charlotte, that's not really Ainge's fault.  Smart I agree has been less of a positive impact than in past years, but with their defense being so shaky, even if he has not been as good, can you really trade him when Boston has no defensive identity? It's a tricky situation that I think is going to depend on how Langford looks and then you can use either Brown/Fournier/Langford at the 2 spot and trade Smart when his value is at its highest (a lot of teams would want him and we could get a good return), or Brown/Smart/Langford. Fournier seems more like insurance to see what the team does in the playoffs as a Hayward-lite and what to do going forward. We do have his bird rights so we have flexibility there. But I can only guess on this, I'm not a GM.  This is a weird year overall with COVID impacting every team. How can you accurately assess an unprecedented situation? This applies to all teams.  Harden, KD and Westbrook were 3 very good players. KD was 2nd in MVP voting with 28 and 8, Westbrook was 12th in MVP voting with 24/5/6. Harden was 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 2nd in DPOY. You know who has a similar comp to that? Last year LeBron was 2nd in MVP, AD was 2nd in DPOY, Harrell won 6th man. The Lakers are a championship level team. Tatum, Brown and Kemba are not on that level. But we can't get LeBron.  I know you were responding to everyone I listed, but it's cherry picking to say PG and Melo got out (didn't win) and so did LeBron and Durant (did win), but then you can flip it around and say Lillard has been loyal (hasn't won) but then again so has Steph Curry (has won). And I know it's kind of an era ago, but Dirk eventually got a ring, Duncan never left and got a ring in 2014 against LeBron. Giannis might stay in Milwaukee his whole career and may win a ring, he may not. Lowry stayed in Toronto his whole career and they won because they honestly got lucky landing Kawhi and the GS injuries that finals. He only wanted to leave SA because of how they handled his injury. And there's a difference between Simmons wanting out and getting traded is my point. Brown was mentioned as a trading piece if we went after Harden. Would Harden be a better duo with JT than Brown is? Sure.  But building super teams or amassing a bunch of talent doesn't always work. The 2012 Lakers, PG to the Thunder, Lob City Clippers,  the Rockets ""helped"" Harden REPEATEDLY with Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, then Russell Westbrook and he still demanded to be traded. It's playing with fire if as a GM you mortgage the future to build a contender now and it doesn't work. Clippers traded away a bunch of picks to land PG. What if they don't win? Milwaukee traded away picks to get Jrue, are they going to beat Brooklyn or Philadelphia? Everyone laughs about it now since the Nets are good, but when Billy King traded to get Garnett and Pierce to be competitive, dude got fired for how that ended up and is the only reason we have Tatum and Brown in the first place.  So if your concern is about their prime and fear they might want out, let me give you 2 scenarios:  1. Trade (because this year's FA doesn't have anyone that makes them contenders with how loaded Brooklyn is) for whoever is available now that is *very* good to put them over the top and teams are willing to just give you despite Ainge's reputation, and competing with Brooklyn's 3 All-Stars and all top 10 players, the Lakers having the best player in the world and Anthony Davis with our undersized front court, Philadelphia and Milwaukee loading up, and try to win as many championships as possible in the next 2-3 years before guaranteed rebuilding. 2. Keep your perennial playoff team good by putting pieces around your budding superstars and be an attractive FA destination, let these aging super teams fade in 2023 RIGHT when Tatum/Brown are in their prime and Brooklyn's big 3 contracts run out, Milwaukee has no 2023 first round draft pick as a trading chip, Embiid's contract is up and that's a serious question Philly has to answer if they want to pay an injury-prone big man when Harris and Simmons are both making over $30M, Kemba will be off the books freeing up cap space, LeBron will be 39 going on 40, and you can almost certainly bet a good team now is going to blow it up before then if they loaded up and don't win.  Flexibility is way more important right now than worrying about this season, because we aren't getting LeBron, Kawhi, Curry, Durant, Harden, Luka, or Giannis, and honestly, who else is worth it if we're REALLY trying to win now. Ainge pulled the trigger on MVP winner Kevin Garnett and the game's best shooter at the time in Ray Allen. Absolutely no way he does that for a guy to help Tatum/Brown unless he is MVP caliber in the current NBA landscape."
Wow he’s better than a KD that literally isn’t playing  Rodney Hood is better than Anthony Davis right now too
"Anthony Davis and jalen Suggs aren’t even close to comparable prospects, stop this."
So did Anthony Davis
"I agree. I think most people don't really have an issue with processes like this, or the methods some players have used in the name of ""player empowerment"". What they have an issue with is where the players end up. If Anthony Davis had tried to force his way to like the Pacers or something, I don't think anyone would have been upset at all (other than Pelicans fans, of course). Or if KD had left OKC and joined the Blazers, then people would have been fine with that. People just don't like it when players either end up on extremely disliked teams like the Lakers, or if they force their way into a situation that unfairly tilts the balance of power in the league, rendering competition largely untenable.   For instance, when the first reports came out that Kawhi wanted the Spurs to trade him, people were pissed, but not because he wanted to leave San Antonio (Spurs fans were, of course). No, what pissed everyone off were the reports that he wanted to be traded to the Lakers. Once he actually ended up in Toronto, everyone was suddenly fine with what Kawhi did. It wasn't the process, it was the result."
But really did people just forget Anthony Davis won a championship last year and played the five almost the whole playoffs?
"&gt;Right so signing Kemba, Horford, Hayward through free agency isnt a big market advantage??  No, it's not.  Paying the max for a fringe All-Star is normal. Gordon Hayward signed with the Hornets this offseason. I guess they're a huge market.  The Lakers have had 6 league MVP's (all of whom were either active All-Stars or averaged 20 ppg the year before) either sign with them or force their way there. Not counting Anthony Davis.  Now go find out how many times the Celtics have had that happen for them.  That's a big market advantage. Bro."
PG: Ben Simmons   SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Bam Adebayo
Pay Anthony Day-to-Davis for 10 years after his prime? I need that good stuff you’re smoking on
no because anthony davis will be demanding a trade the moment things go south and that contract would be hard to move
"Rfed, this is an incredibly optimistic view of the NBA.  Durant has missed almost 30 games this season Anthony Davis has missed around 25. Kyrie Irving has missed close to 15 games.   These are “the best athletes in the world” according to you. It’s not that they are not “performing well”, **they aren’t even performing most nights.**  It’s a joke to think that this is a great version of the NBA."
"&gt; most of the reason he fell to 16 was that teams knew he would struggle to play due to anxiety tho. he would have gone top 5 easily  This is just revisionist history.  In a draft with Anthony Davis, MKG (lol), Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond, and Harrison Barnes -- all of whom were one and done elite prospects -- as well as Dion Waiters and Damian Lillard, no one was going to pick 21 year-old Royce White in the top 5.  And Thomas Robinson, the actual Player of the Year in White's conference, was also picked ahead of him.  He was a fringe top 10 pick with no baggage."
"  &gt;Has this ever happened, a team tanking to get a top 5 pick  Lakers tanked, got Ingram and Lonzo, both are 2nd pick in draft. Their fans acknowledged their tank general Byron Scott.  &gt; and that pick happens to **help** them win and go to the finals?   Ingram and Lonzo helped them got Anthony Davis, and Davis definitely helped Lakers go to finals and win the title."
"Karl-Anthony """"Glen""Big Baby""Davis"""" Towns"
We won a championship  And he was injured. And we traded for Anthony fucking Davis lol
&gt; The Lakers have gone 16-10 in home games. Los Angeles is fourth in the Western Conference with 51.6 points per game in the paint led by Anthony Davis averaging 12.7.  Helpful
&gt;At least we did right by Jrue and sent him to a contender.  Same with Anthony Davis 👍
"Maybe role players with limited options anyway will be drawn to Zion, but he’s not luring stars to NOLA. Anthony Davis played with two stars while there, and both were traded for."
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Stephen Curry 4. Nikola Jokic 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Joel Embiid 9. Anthony Davis 10. Luka Doncic 11. Damian Lillard  Right off the top of my head, im sure a couple players could be swapped if I sat down for a couple hours and and used more than the eye test and knowledge readily available. BIG believer in Jokic, but I truly feel 2-7 is interchangeable. Took playoffs into account but I didnt pin my whole argument on them. Hardest to rank was Kawhi, hes damn good but I feel like his impact in the regular season is lacking and he is an overrated playoff performer after last years utter failure. 9-11 could also be swapped around."
CP3  Marcus Smart  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  This team is winning at least 2 championships
"Sorry, should I have just called you a 'goofy' instead?   And no, this is how you respond to someone who can't recognize the legacy of a 30th pick who went on to become one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, a multi-time all star, and who led a 5th seed to a competitive finals against the best player in the world and Anthony Davis. And to someone who gives the impression they don't regard anything but championships as deserving of recognition which is a famously sub-neanderthal level of thinking about sports and takes pride in ignoring all nuance, context, and actual analysis of on-court play."
"Dell Demps did right by a lot of players. But what goodwill did that curry with Anthony Davis, Cousins, or Rondo?  I don’t begrudge Griffin for making a move to recoup whatever he could at the end of the day.   Poor Redick. He’s on a playoff team. How sad for him."
The issue with the Anthony Davis trade request was that he was under contract to play in New Orleans until summer 2020 and there was a massive conflict of interest beacuse his agent is in LeBron's inner circle and he asked only to be traded to the Lakers with the Knicks as a red hearing. There was nothing illegal's about what he did and it obviously paid off for him but it was obvious that it was another player manipulating the outcome for his teams favor.
"Yea contract flip side say they play out their contract and doesn’t want to resign they can leave for nothing the ream doesn’t get any assets , or they can request a trade and the team can get some assets back example the Anthony Davis trade"
"Ohh like Dwayne wade, kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Kevin love, Chris Bosh?"
Minutes per game in the 2020 NBA finals:  Anthony Davis: 38.2 Dwight Howard: 11.8 Javale Mcgee: &lt; 1  Who the fuck was playing center for the vast majority of lakers minutes if it wasn’t Davis?  I can’t believe I’m arguing with a Lakers fan about whether or not Davis should be playing at the 5 or the 4
Anthony Davis is a disappointment. If hes around hes highly skilled but not assertive enough.   The rest of the nonlebron lakers would put up a good figgt for 10th in the east
"PG -- Chris Paul   SG -- Jrue Holiday      SF --  Brandon Ingram   PF --  Zion   C -- Anthony Davis    BONUS: 6th Man: David West     Literally everybody else would have some sort of Asterisk of ""Well, but...."" I'm pretty sure Shoeless Joe Jackson might qualify as our 7th man."
"Choosing starters for all time Lakers ain't easy, here's my picks with bench in parentesis:    PG: Magic Johnson (Jerry West)  SG: Kobe Bryant (Gail Goodrich)  SF: LeBron James (James Worthy)  PF: Anthony Davis (Pau Gasol)  C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Shaquille O'Neal)"
but we aren't making posts about embiid and anthony davis shooting percentages..
Rudy gobert is a top 5 defender in the league no argument  Your saying he’s not one because he can’t guard the top bigs well who tf can Anthony Davis can’t guard Joel Embiid so I guess he isn’t a good defender   Basically what I’m saying when your going against a superstar or elite scorers it’s a team effort on defense   also Rudy not just a shot blocker he’s actually the best rim protector in the league and rim protecting is not all about getting blocks there’s more to it   And who the hell keep coming up with the stupid that gobert is useless out the paint he’s still a average perimeter defender
So do Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis
"&gt; Because 95% of NBA fans watch more Skip Bayless than actual games ?  TIL no analyst, former player, current player, media personalities, voters except Ben Taylor watch NBA games. How very convenient.  &gt; Like, if you think ""this is what his team did when he was the best player therefore I can make conclusions while ignoring context"" is a good argument, then you'd think Harden is better than AD. And unfortunately, most people do think that way.  Harden beats AD out on every advanced metric too. This isnt just a case of better team, Harden is exactly the reason his teams look good.  He is one of the greatest floor raisers ever, meaning no matter the talent around him, he doesnt fuck around and win 28 games.  Anthony Davis has little impact unless he has the right players around him.  Actually, so far you've only been attacking my points, you've never actually made a point of your own. What are you arguments for AD being BETTER???"
"Chris Paul, Jrue Holiday, Glen Rice, Anthony Davis, and Alonzo Mourning starting with Larry Johnson, Zion, Brandon Ingram, Baron Davis, and Dell Curry (I guess I don't remember too many more Pelicans guards tbh) as the second unit. The Pelicans all time team would be fun."
I cheer against him because of his fans. That's really the only reason.  His fans diminish every other nba player's accomplishments including LeBron's teammates.  I swear his fans treat Anthony Davis like he's a bum now.
"embiid, harden, kyrie, durant, giannis, sabonis, lavine, butler, adebayo, trae young, vucevic, beal, luka, zion, ingram, mitchell, gobert, lillard, jokic, kahwhi, paul geroge, lebron, booker, chris paul, randle, anthony davis, curry. So he's somewhere around 30?"
Anthony Davis also
Anthony Davis
"[https://i.insider.com/5481ccb869beddba19347fdf?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp](https://i.insider.com/5481ccb869beddba19347fdf?width=700&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp)  &amp;#x200B;  As a Kentucky fan, here's Anthony Davis:   Age 15: 6'2"" 175lb  Age 17: 6'7"" 192lb  Age 19: 6'10"" 212lb  Age 21: 6'10"" 240lb"
"Davis playoff career stats: 34 games 29/11/3 on 63% TS  Harden’s last 33 playoff games (2 playoff seasons): 31/6/7 on 60% TS  Anthony Davis has only made the playoffs during his and his teams’ best seasons. Harden has made the playoffs every year of his career regardless of age, team, performance."
"I actually did take statistics in college, and I’m aware that they are somewhat flawed, but they are the best objective measure we have. RAPM may be more accurate but it doesn’t extend into the 60s, 70s, 80s and for greatest of all times list, raw numbers don’t allow you to compare someone like George Mikan to Anthony Davis because rebounds weren’t tracked for the first year or two of Mikan’s career."
"I'm not gay but I want Anthony Davis in a log cabin in the woods with LeBron James. They won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as AD stands in the kitchen window watching Bron tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. He’ll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing himself to think of women while his thoughts drift back to LeBron. He won't be able to climax and will eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes they will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but they both deny themselves and go back to what they were doing. One day one of them will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
Here are a couple reasons:  1. Lebron James and Anthony Davis 2. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George 3. Kevin Durant and James Harden 4. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid
"Why would Rich Paul be mad that the Lakers traded away Lonzo, who hasnt hired him then, for Anthony Davis, his client?   But then again, Lonzo would be expensive anyway"
Not the guy you were replying to but I distinctly recall thinking that Thomas Robinson would be a better NBA player than Anthony Davis....yikes
Anthony Davis likes to avoid playing center so I wouldn’t consider him one.
And Luka Doncic. And anthony davis.
eh Vogel turned Kuzma into a passable defender and had a team without Anthony Davis ranking #1 in the league in defense  Drummond bout to win DPOY
He’s just starting to figure it out. People jump ship to early on the big guys. He’s gonna grow to an Anthony Davis type player barring injury.
I find it hilarious how the nets add a 35 y/o LMA and a way past his prime BG and act like it’s unfair but seem to be completely quiet when Lebron and the lakers add   Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroeder  Montrezl Harrell  Andre Drummond
"Literally the only reason Anthony Davis isn't a Celtic is because his father or uncle or whoever did not want him playing in Boston because of what we ""did to IT"". It absolutely exists. Would be even worse if a team refused to buyout a contract."
But having one of those guys shouldn’t disqualify you. Lebron wasn’t disqualified from having Anthony Davis
&gt;  Not too sure who I’d want guarding Ayton though.   We have a guy who goes by the name of Anthony Davis. Pretty sure he’ll be playing the 5 if Drummond/gasol are getting cooked
"Drummond, Anthony Davis, and Lebron James is pretty far and away the greatest front court in NBA history. No? Arguably was without Drummond and then they bring in a guy who for all his flaws still puts up 14/14 for his career on limited shots and 55% fg.   Lakers have basically created a lineup that would be impossible without the buyout market and its unquestionably bad for the NBA."
"He also had the worst team out of probably all of them, save maybe Lillard who's had his fair share of teammate problems. I'm not saying he's better than all of them as a number 1 option (he's not; mostly because of his skillsets), but in a perfect world made for Anthony Davis, he could easily have a ring as a number 1 option."
"If you're these players, are you picking those teams over A) defending champions with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, or B) team in the East with 2-time Finals MVP + 1-time reg season MVP + Kyrie?    Assuming all healthy of course.  I'd personally join those top 2 teams as well and let LeBron/AD or KD/Harden carry me to at least the conference finals."
Yea I don't care about how they look in the regular season. Nobody is beating lebron james and anthony davis 4 times in 7 games.
"That's not a realistic team though. If you dropped Anthony Davis on last year's Celtics or Heat they'd probably win the championship, but neither of those teams would be realistic given salary cap rules."
"the biggest benefit on defense will be how flexible Anthony Davis is now.... he can roam out to the perimeter, like he likes to do, guard the ball-handler, force changes on the perimeter (not passing inside cause of Drummond), recover to the paint. fucking deadly"
"Oh for sure, it would never get through. The NBA is the polar opposite of the NFL, the players have all the power. I actually have no idea how to go about resetting this LeBron era in that aspect. Certain cities will always be a better draw than others, but right now it's fucking absurd. Anthony Davis is a prime example."
not if you're Lonzo apparently. Or Anthony Davis.
"Lets be clear... Anthony Davis was the best player in the WCF last season. That's a fact. He outplayed Jokic, and I can argue Murray was Denver's best player statistically. The Finals MVP was LeBron yes, but WCF MVP would have been AD."
Just how much Lakers are really a contender depend on the status of Lebron and ANthony Davis. I think we can all truthfully admit that. How far will they fall with them out also. Its not far to the bottom of the playoff standings. Nuggets and Clippers are the two teams I think slightly below a healthy Lakers team I think. I'm not all in on the Jazz yet.
"That's the point of all the money.  Draymond can complain all he wants, but at the end of the day, players sign contracts.  They all take the bag.  They should fulfill that contract unless both sides mutually want to cut ties.  This isn't the NFL where the owners can just cut them.  The players already have the guaranteed money.  Suck it up buttercup.  Or sign smaller 1-year deals if you want to travel the world.  Probably won't get as much money, but hey, at least you can keep picking where you play!    If I signed a 4-year contract and took the maximum salary allowed (Hi Anthony Davis!) I'm taking the bag of money and busting my ass, and if the owner moves me, so be it.  I signed up for this lifestyle, and am compensated ridiculously well as a result.      Now, these guys are saying,  I still want more of your money, so please buy me out of my contract for the remaining time (of which I won't play for you) so I can go somewhere else for much cheaper (a number you would kill to pay me at, but too bad).      These guys are acting like FAs when they were under contract literally hours before, and then the teams that need the help, kept a clean cap sheet, aren't over the tax, can't get them anyhow.      Maybe all 30 franchises should just move to NY or LA at this point.  I'm sure the TV numbers won't suffer at all right?      The other teams need to have a chance.  There are plenty of fans paying way too much money to watch their team get screwed by every little thing.  These guys already take less money to team with LeBron in the offseason, they gotta do it during buyouts too?  Small markets have to hit grand slam after grand slam in the draft, and then it still probably isn't enough."
"If he's ""bodied"" by an All-NBA player is that surprising? Who isn't bodied by a top 10 player?   Drummond actually has more rebounds, assists, steals than Embiid in their head to head matchups, and similar blocks. Yes Embiid is more talented scorer so what? Drummond is the 4th/5th offensive option on the Lakers, not the best player on the team anymore.  And he's going to be along side probably the best big man in the game, Anthony Davis on one side, and the best player in the world LeBron James on the other side. So that's a formidable front court. His job will be defense, rebounding, put back dunks with occasional post-up. Excellent pickup for Lakers compared to having Gasol."
People said the same thing about Anthony Davis lol
"The plan was to trade for Anthony Davis, but LeBron and Klutch got to him first."
Anthony Davis only has one of those things.
"I think it has to do with the level of value a player has in each sport.  In the NBA, elite players have the ability to change a team’s fortunes just by themselves. So a player like AD or Kawhi can tank their team’s season by sitting out. It gives players a lot of negotiating power.   In MLB, one player choosing to sit out won’t make a big difference on the team. So players don’t have nearly as much leverage to force their way out.   Also, the NBA structures its contracts so that players can make more money by re-signing with their team. Anthony Davis made an extra $40 million by getting traded to LA for one season as opposed to signing with them in free agency(he would have made even more money by re-signing with NOLA). MLB doesn’t have this rule, so there isn’t nearly as much of an incentive for players to sit out."
"Well, not like most of them watched any Nuggets games during the regular season. I watched every game last year, and I can't tell you how frustrating watching Grant miss every lob Jokic threw to him. Even during the playoffs the Anthony Davis buzzer beater was his fault, he told Plumlee right before the inbound to double Lebron, leaving AD wide open."
"Anthony Davis isn’t really the type of player you can expect to lead mediocre teams to success. He’s not a playmaker, he needs a really good to elite playmaker on his team. Hence why his 2 most successful seasons came with Rondo and Lebron running point."
Carmelo is better than Anthony Davis because he has more All-Star appearances.
"All nba first team lebron James, all nba first team Anthony Davis, 6moty Montreal Harrell, 6moty runner up Dennis Schroder, close to all star Kyle kuzma. Also, lets not pretend that Drummond is some scrub, he was an all star 3 years ago and ""on layups"" is such a strawman."
"I think it’s fair to say that Anthony Davis has a more diverse offensive game too, he’s a much better shooter and shot creator than Zion,  Zion just gets every offensive board imaginable."
"I’m gonna be honest man, Dwight’s role in the championship run is incredibly overrated. The Lakers won because they had LeBron James and Anthony Davis. You could have replaced Dwight with any average centre and the results would have been the same."
"Lol, even when both Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol were out with injury a few games ago, Montrezl still came off the bench behind G-Leaguer DeVontae Cacok."
"Better peak? Maybe. Still, in totality, I'll take AD. Anthony Davis is one of the best defenders in the league while giving you like 80% of what Zion can give you offensively. Even with his injuries, I think David will have a longer career in the league. Davis has also been doing this longer so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt."
The Anthony Davis Kentucky team had 6 players drafted
anthony davis and?? still 1 less perennial allstar than kd has lmao. not to mention blake and lma
"Yes, but did they actively recruit them like they seemingly do today? Jordan didn’t recruit Scottie, Kareem didn’t recruit Magic, Bird didn’t recruit any of the Celtics and Robinson didn’t recruit Duncan. LeBron used the media to recruit Bosh to Miami, he recruited Kevin Love to Cleveland, Anthony Davis to the Lakers... same with Kyrie and KD picking Brooklyn then recruiting Harden... I can respect that they all had it back in the day but they didn’t recruit like the players do now."
"&gt;Good thing he has lebron james and Anthony Davis lol you don’t have to be a perfect coach to win with those guys   No one is a perfect coach, and both James and especially Davis lose more often than they win, so this makes no sense at all."
AnThOnY dAvIs &gt; TiM dUnCaN
"Davis relies on athleticism for just about every bit of his game. Not to say he’s not skilled, he’s an absolute sniper when he’s hot, but being one of the greatest Lob Threats and Rim Protectors, his athleticism allows him to be Anthony Davis, and if he’s injured, he’s not a 100% physically, thus his game suffers.  KD is one of the greatest shooters ever, what more is there to say?"
Good thing he has lebron james and Anthony Davis lol you don’t have to be a perfect coach to win with those guys
"&gt;Steph edging out Harden in advanced stats while Harden has better counting stats absolutely makes them comparable  We already discussed their numbers on a per possession basis because Curry played significantly fewer minutes. We came to the conclusion that their counting stats per possession were comparable. Do you not remember this? Similar counting stats + better advanced stats means a better statistical season for Curry. But now the per possession numbers dont matter? Oh it doesnt fit your narrative, so you're disregarding more information again. I get it.  &gt;Bro I have literally proven you outright wrong several times  The fact that you actually think this is hilarious. You just agreed with me. We've already agreed that their counting stats per possession were similar, and now you agree that Curry had better advanced stats. You're literally proving yourself wrong...  And for the  10th time, that article doesnt say Harden was close to winning. It ranks Curry significantly ahead of Harden. The article ranked Harden near Chris Paul and Anthony Davis, who were nowhere close to winning MVP."
"Well that's why we have Anthony Davis and Lebron James. He's arguably the best defensive coach in the league. He should absolutely get an extension, regardless"
"It's a little early to say Anthony Davis is absolute ass.  Less than a year ago most people had him as a top 5 player in the NBA.  He's had a rough year so far, but you can't write him off yet."
Anthony Davis' nickname is ADisney
You know I'm talking about Anthony Davis not drummond right? Lol
Boogie and the Brow.   DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis was fun to watch together in that short period.
Just what we all suspected. Dwight Powell being Anthony davis and Andre drummonds weakness.
"Imagine having Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond and Marc gasoft only to get outplayed by Dwight fucking powell    LoL Lakers 🤡"
Anthony Davis 5-19.  Think he made like 1 FG in the second half.  That was ugly.
"Anthony Davis wasn’t bad tonight, he was atrocious. GG Mavs."
Dwight Powell &gt; Anthony Davis
LeBron James/Anthony Davis
Western conference sweating bullets at the prospect of Anthony Davis being back
"There are off-ball superstars, like Anthony Davis. Even Curry plays a lot off-ball (obviously he CAN and doesn’t HAVE TO).  He doesn’t even have to be those guys either. You’d just need a Rubio, Rondo, Simmons type of guy to pair him with. It wouldn’t be a contender or anything crazy, but a borderline playoff team? Yeah.  As much as it’s better to be a complete player, there’s a lot of value in being able to score 20+ on 11 dribbles, it allows your team to do so much more when you aren’t dribbling the air out of the ball (just to get similar production).  For example, McCollum is a better shot creator than Klay, but I’d much rather have Klay even just discussing offense"
It could've went to 6 if Anthony Davis didn't hit that game winner. I think Nuggets gave the best shot out of any team last year.
"&gt;That's a lie. Per 100 possessions:   Harden: 37/7.7/9.4/2.6/1   Steph: 35.5/6.4/11.6/3/0.3  You're right. They had similar stats, and Curry was more efficient. They were pretty even there, but in advanced stats, Curry blows Harden out of the water. Did you even read the article you linked? Your own article proves me right...  &gt;After ranking each player from one through six based on their finish in each of these 12 all-in-one metrics, Curry comes away with by far the best overall score.  Harden was a distant 2nd in that all-in-one score, closer to Chris Paul and Anthony Davis. I dont see what possible argument Harden has for the 2015 MVP. That article pretty much shut down any case for Harden.  &gt;If the voting criteria was the same as it always is, the best player on one of the best teams (Including context), then it shouldn't have gone to Westbrook  Of course. It should've gone to Kawhi or Harden. Either one wouldve been fine, and it wouldn't have been a robbery either way. I never said Harden shouldn't win it, just that Kawhi had a good case over Harden. That was my point, and I thought it was pretty clear. I was arguing your point of ""Harden was robbed and should have 2 MVPs"". He was not robbed either 2015 or 2017, and either Kawhi or Harden couldve rightfully won 2017 MVP if it were a normal year."
"&gt; LeBron hasn't won a playoff game in Utah yet either.   Ha   &gt;His team's struggle there and they should be worried about playing in Utah come playoff time.  Lmfao   &gt;It's definitely not a good matchup for the Lakers. Utah are one of the few teams that can matchup well defensively with the Lakers, and the Jazz's offense will be a huge mismatch.  Who’s guarding LeBron James and Anthony Davis? Royce O’Neal and Bojan Bogdanovic? Lmfao"
Drummond is not a quality option. You are delusional if you think Rudy fucking Gobert and Donovan Mitchell are going to be competitive against LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"The Rockets going super small ruined what should have been a great series. Was horrendous strategy dealing with Anthony Davis they got murdered on the boards. And LAC choking up a storm meant the only wing in the West playoffs last year capable of dealing with Lebron was gone fishing. And then the Nugs tried to win on 2’s against Lebron and AD, another dumb strategy.   That’s why I think the Lakers were so aggressive adding pieces this offseason, they knew they had a bit of good fortune (all title teams do) in never really being pushed until the Finals."
"Sure 28th and 29th defense but 3rd and fourth-ranked offense.  You guys also went from Nurkic, Aminu, Ed Davis, Evan Turner(16thD,4thO) to Nurkic playing 8 games, Hassan Whiteside, Carmelo Anthony, and Simons(27thD, 3rd O)."
"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/9/14/21436514/lakers-dominant-defense-stats-ratings-anthony-davis-lebron-james-nba-playoffs  “The player with the best defensive RAPTOR in the playoffs? Anthony Davis.  Davis has been one of the most valuable defensive players in the NBA this season (some would even argue the most valuable) but his value to the Lakers specifically has shined through in the postseason, where he’s been able to show his defensive versatility in multiple positions. Through 10 playoff games, the Lakers posted a defensive rating of 101.4 with Davis on the court and a defensive rating of 113.7 off of the court. His point differential of -12.3 is the highest point of anyone on the team. Alex Caruso is second with -10.1.”  You can check this site if you wanna make comparisons: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/  This is coming from someone who almost never uses defensive stats, i do think the eye test holds more weight which is why i usually like to refer to video evidence."
Remember when he hit that 3 to tie it late against the Pelicans in the playoffs and Anthony Davis literally tackled him? No foul call
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What’s defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
"I’m so confused bro we’re talking about Anthony Davis shooting 3’s in the playoffs  And the Lakers smoked your team, so either your own team isn’t “real competition” or you’re on drugs.. maybe both"
"I too, would put my money on a team that has LeBron James and Anthony Davis"
"I mean I agree AI was the fucking man, and watching him step over Lue was the tits. Just please watch more jokic.   Scope game 2 against the Lakers where they were losing and he just took Anthony freaking Davis and dwight into the post like 4 straight times, hitting a 3 in the middle of it, and brought them back from down 8 to tie the game on prefect shooting with under 3 minutes to play... post up bucket, post up FTs, 3pter, post up bucket, post up bucket. 5 straight possessions, from down 100-92 to up 103-102 with 20 seconds left... but then AD hit"
"I thought everyone here got blind after that 3rd year 30ppg month. Iirc, Mirotic also avg around 25 on start of the month and we stamp him as great partner for Anthony Davis"
"See thats my problem with the Gobert discourse though, i get that hes an extraordinary paint protector and defensive big but when you try to imply that hes in his own league defensively or that hes the nba’s best defender thats when it becomes an issue.   For the most part the guards he was isoed against werent these quick shiftty guys who have deadly jumpers, they were guys like THT who dont have well developed jumpshots or guys like hill who just simply dont have the skill to take advantage of a guy like Gobert. Even when he did get stops against those top tier guards like Murray i would argue it was more so a result of bad shot selection rather than lockdown defense. For example in the Murray isolation, Murray didn’t really back up and take his time sizing up gobert, he just kind of put a shot up quickly in a spot where Gobert was comfortable. This is fine if you’re calling him an a great paint protector with some perimeter ability but if you’re calling him the best defensive player in the league then you have to talk about him in relation to guys like Draymond Green or Anthony Davis and those are guys that stay with even the most elite guards on a consistent basis. There’s nobody in this league who Davis cant guard extremely well, but there quite a few players who can score on Gobert fairly easily.   The problem in the playoffs is that as you get deeper and deeper you will inevitably have to face the Kevin Durants, Kawhi Leonards or Steph Currys of the world and when players like that exist in offenses that force everybody to constantly be closing out to perimeter player or force switches then you cant have your best defensive player be someone like Gobert. You need versatility and when thats the case you’ll always be better off with a Draymond Green.  For example look at the perimeter defense of an out of shape Anthony Davis in comparison, taking on Kawhi Leonard in Isolation while also spending lots of time protecting the paint and closing out to the perimeter: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcLo3Wbt6A  These kind of shape shifting defenders that can literally do anything you need them to are thd most valuable defensive forces in the nba. They are never vulnerable and they will never be played off the floor.   Heres a few more videos showcasing the defensive versatility of Davis: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tn9QRJMec  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IB_S13ELU3c  These are the most valuable defenders in the league."
"Also, they may still have Anthony Davis."
Anthony Davis.   Dale Davis.   Probably even Anthony Mason.
"I don't think Anthony Davis is very far from those players though. Also, Dirk and Garnett had the misfortune of also playing in the same era as Duncan and a number of other amazing players like Stoudemire."
-Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis has 4 First Team All-NBA selections, which is as many as Dirk, Garnett, CP3, Moses Malone, and David Robinson.   It's more than Bill Russell and Steph Curry."
"All the ones you named +   T. Allen  Giannis  Bruce Bowen  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Defense is really weird to rank though, since a big man's defensive capabilities are so much more important than wing defense, particurly in zones. Hell, even 2013 Hibbert was a more impactful defender for his team than Jordan ever was for his teams in his whole career.   It's like asking ""who are the best ball handlers ever,"" don't be surpised when it's only pgs and sgs lol."
"Nobody thinks those guys are superstars, and if they do they have the wrong definition of superstar. Superstar ends at the Anthony Davis, dame tier."
"Let me just say I am a Lebron hater, and Anthony Davis doesn't catch nearly as much flack as he should for his performances this year.   He's been downright bad offensively in a number of the games this season when he's actually managed to play. Borderline all star production and was lucky that the voting only accounted for the first like 2/5th of the season."
"He kinda picked em *again* to beat the Lakers in the playoffs this year. At halftime of the Mavs-Lakers game tonight they pulled up some current standings, and he said the Lakers were probly gonna play Portland or Denver first round, and that they wouldn't beat either team. Ernie tried to give him a little out, like ""even if they get Lebron and Anthony Davis back?"" But Chuck said they wouldn't be back long enough from their injuries at that point to play well enough to win"
So anthony davis in college?
Like Anthony Davis this season not being able to fully recover from several leg injuries from the bubble
"""who would you rather have in your starting lineup, Dragan Bender or Anthony Davis"""
Bro even I have a little heart attack every time KP falls down. Can’t imagine what it’s like for Mavs fans.   Oh nvm we have Anthony Davis
"I can only make it down to 10.  Who's tradeable among:  Curry  Lebron  Anthony Davis  Giannis  Lillard  Jokic  Durant  Doncic  Embiid  Kevin ""James Harden"" Porter Jr."
Oh that is a ***DISGUSTING*** act by Anthony Davis
"I got you. I’ll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
Imagine expecting to have to guard Andre Drummond all night and you have to guard Anthony Davis instead
"Am I crazy. If Jason Terry was a larger man, his game might look like Anthony Davis’ game?"
The league really gave Kyle Kuzma and Andre Drummond a prime Anthony Davis.
"The obviously wouldn’t unless Lebron signed off on it. He’s Lebron James, and though he wasn’t there long, he LeGMed getting Anthony Davis to join and then won a title, and is poised to do it again this year. Spurs also wouldn’t have ever traded Duncan, or Mavs with Dirk, unless those players specifically signed off on it."
"Again I ask, Simons for Anthony Davis?  You are wildly overrating your own players and clearly know very little about the league in general man   This is a ridiculous take for too many reasons to even address. Honestly one of the more out of touch paragraphs on this subreddit. It's word salad"
"¨Are you putting Payton on Kawhi(230), Lebron(260), Butler(230)?¨ No because they all small forwards . Would you put Anthony Davis and Jokic on Zach Lavine or Marcus Smart? No. Kawhi and PG are bigger and longer but I didnt say he was going to be similar to them I said he would be in their category in defense impact  and ability. Although Kawhi and Gary actually do defend in the same sort of way/style IMO."
"He couldn't make the playoffs his 1st year as a laker. Then forced a trade for Anthony Davis, who had multiple years still on his contract. At least KD was a free agent.   Were you living in a cave in 2019? CP3 + Harden couldn't take down a Durant-less warriors in game 6 of WCSF and then Lillard lost 4-0 in WCF, also no durant. Way to expose yourself as a know nothing clown  Educate yourself:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOAyeJbjmS4"
There is no scheme that hide a plodding 7'2 big man against elite perimeter creaters. You need an Anthony Davis type player that can go small. Thats why AD is the best defending center in the league
"the only team Anthony Davis has ever lost to in the playoffs is the the Warriors. Thats hardly ""any team that matters""."
Anthony Davis is easily more than an inch taller than Lebron
I think his performance throughout the 2020 playoffs speaks for itself. This idea that Anthony Davis isn't an absolute monster whether as a solo star or as part of a duo is ridiculous.
What does this even mean. Anthony Davis was just as difficult to defend in New Orleans
So Anthony Davis will get a tech like every game?
"A hard max and min cap like the NFL.  Why did Anthony Davis leave?  Oh becsuse it was LA.  I dont know what you do to discourage this, but I bet you could find something."
"As far as record goes: The Lakers are also missing Anthony Davis while the Sixers have had Ben Simmons, the Sixers are in the East and the Lakers are in the East  As far as Embiid: Playing better than who? I don't think LeBron should be MVP either"
"Until I see Memphis build a team from nothing to a title contender in a few phone calls to attract a Lebron and Anthony Davis, then 5  hand-chosen complimentary players, I disagree."
"He also has elite PnR defense (0.77 points per possession, only Turner and Gobert are better this year). And is elite among bigs for generating deflections and steals, the latter of which are more valuable than blocks because they result in a change of possession.    He allows 4.7 FG/7.2 attempts within 6ft of the rim (63.5%). Thats bad, but if you change his DFG% within 6ft to Embiid’s (53.5%), it’s only 3.9 FG/game or a difference of 0.8 = 1.6 points. Of course there are other factors like deterrence (although, worth nothing is that Embiid actually allows more raw FG within 6ft, 4.8/9 attempts), but 1.6 points is really overstated as some crippling issue.    For comparison, Jokic has allowed a slightly lower DFG% within 6ft than Anthony Davis over the past few years, so bad 5 rim protection still &gt;= elite 4 rim protection."
"Player A, i'd be like Anthony Davis"
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He’s better then 15 of these guys?

"Dude you're getting downvoted because you're refusing to accept the reason why the game was flexed. Wizards/Lakers is like, a 7 on the excitement scale but people will watch Anthony Davis and Russ."
[Source](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-davis-led-lakers-to-championship-by-shooting-like-kevin-durant-but-can-that-really-continue/) for anyone wondering.
"You can pretend he wasn’t having near career lows in points, minutes and rebounds with the media actively calling him out for not being himself and making LeBron do too much. Look at his advanced stats and tell yourself Anthony Davis has been Anthony Davis this year."
We get to watch Anthony Davis make westbrooks life hell again
"OP's next question - Did Anthony Davis save Lebron's career?  Greats will be great regardless of eras or supporting cast. He might not be as great as he has been with Magic but, the same can be said for Magic without Kareem."
&gt; Anthony Davis said he felt a “ripping” sensation when he planted his foot wrong in Denver  NO FUCK REALLY  &gt; in February  ok whew.... AD you want sit for another month?
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
Can't wait for LeBron and Anthony Davis to return
So it seems what you’re saying is that he’s still Anthony Day-To-Davis
Anthony and Antonio Davis
"I’d say it’s a very even matchup, elite offense vs elite defense. I couldn’t call anyone the heavy favorite due to Brooklyn’s insane talent in its big 3, and the Lakers insane advantage with having Anthony Davis go up against a team with big men that are either too slow or too inexperienced to defend him"
Anthony Davis return is the reason
"Bron is beast. But let’s not pretend he didn’t have bosh, wade, ray allen, shaq, kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard as team mates. He’s an all time great but he’s have a lot of help."
As long as they get LeBron and Anthony Davis back they will be fine
At least that would be more interesting than seeing a severely injured Nets team being single-handedly lifted by Kyrie and then getting ass fucked by the Lakers when Anthony Davis and LeBron James inevitably come back like those Cavs teams a few years ago where they were literally the Cleveland LeBrons getting savaged by the Warriors multiple years in a row.
"Anthony Davis is like that. Because of the way his limbs are, he’s just far more susceptible to injuries than most. It’s about leverage and having your limbs being too long especially in the lower leg region.  This video explains it pretty well: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2jAvht_i1OY"
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8. Kevin Durant  9. Luka Doncic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Damian Lillard  12. Jimmy Butler 13. Jayson Tatum 14. Chris Paul  15. Paul George  16. Bradley Beal 17. Karl-Anthony Towns 18. Devin Booker  19.

Anthony Davis - 3 Weeks (Accidentally shaved off unibrow)
"the NBA should strip him of his MVPs, DPOY and give them to their rightful winners. Harden, Bron, and Anthony Davis"
"Small ball = rebounds and rim protection goodbye, unless you have a defensive big with 3pt shooting or passing like Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, or KG"
Anthony Davis is the only other one that I can think of. Are there more?
"A “super team” that had one “Flash” year of Wade and Chris Bosh as the third wheel, and another “super team” with two guys who had never made the playoffs before they played with Lebron. It’s a little different than a “super team” with a former MVP in his prime and Lebron’s former 2 option as your #3. Or a super team with the reigning 2-time MVP, the multi-year DPOY, and arguably the best 3&amp;D guy in the league.   Comparisons between KD’s super teams and Lebron’s are ludicrous. If Lebron had been playing with Wade in his prime for those 4 years, it’d be a little less ludicrous. But ludicrous nonetheless.  Anthony Davis is probably the best player Lebron has played with that was in his prime for multiple years they spent together, and it’s at the end of Lebron’s career. So comparing a 36 year old Lebron with AD to Durant and Curry when the former was like 28 is a little ridiculous as well."
"not in the name of Lebron, Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Dwight Howard, Kyrie Irving, and Lamarcus Aldridge"
"Usually it’s cause the team has a center that has to play (Embiid, gobert, jokic etc..) and they aren’t comfortable switching onto an island with the perimeter player so it’ll be even worse if they don’t run the drop scheme. It’s why a guy like Anthony Davis is so valuable cause he can both switch onto guards and protect the rim at a high level"
"The problem is no one else has Anthony Davis. That’s why AD is the best defender in the entire league and the best big in the league, as his game gets even better in the playoffs"
"In all honesty this is one of the better all nba team predictions ive seen in the last month or so, but I have a few comments.   1) Although producing like an mvp candidate when he plays I dont even think KD is illegible for All NBA because hes played so little games (24 of 57 possible games) but i could be wrong on this bc of the season only being 72 games. It really depends on how he finishes the season in terms of games played.   2) With that \^ being said who would be his replacement? When it comes to the forwards in the NBA this year its a tight race and I think it's going to come down to an even split of games won (standings) and personal stats. I agree that zion should make one of the teams (not necessarily saying hes KD's replacement on the second team). If Jimmy Butler keeps the same stats and wins 70% of the remaining games I can see him making the third team but I have to admit that I would personally put Julius Randle and PG ahead of him. Julius Randle is putting up 23, 11, 6 on great shooting and his team is a couple games above .500. PG is puting up 23 6 and 5 as the second best player on a team that has twice as many wins as losses. After that the forward position isn't that competitive.   3) All your center selections are right on the money, its a shame that embiid is going to be on second team. the NBA really needs to modernize all nba selection to 2 BC and 3 FC like the all star game.  4) LeBron is an x-factor in all of this. If he plays the remaining games he can lock the first team over Kawhi but I can see some media voters choose kawhi over Lebron if he doesnt play any of the remaining games (Lebron would have played 41 of 72 games).   5) With the streak that Curry is on I can absolutely see him making the first team \*edit: in all fareness his streak wasn't this long at the time you wrote this\* I know that some may disagree bc his team currently sits 9th in western standings but Anthony Davis has made All NBA first team once or twice without making playoffs in the same season before. Regardless though I agree with all 6 of your guards. If bradley Beal wins scoring title this year it might be the first time EVER that the scoring champ doesnt make one of the all nba teams in the same season."
"That’s not true. It just makes his passing and shooting WAY more valuable. Pretty broken thinking. And people don’t realize that a bad 5 rim protector is still as good or better than an elite 4, like Jokic has had better rim protection numbers than Anthony Davis for like 3 years. https://imgur.com/a/6HZBV7y"
"Because he always does great against bigs with no skill like Gobert, Adams, even Lopez at times. Against players like Anthony Davis he gets blocked every time"
"Go take your cape somewhere else.   KD has played with Great players on stacked teams. Harden, Kyrie, Curry, Klay, Westbrook.  LeBron has played with Great players on stacked teams. Ray Allen, Bosh, Wade, Kyrie, Kevin, Anthony Davis  I'm cool with saying the KD Warriors were the best bc no team really got close to beating them while healthy.   Iguodala and Dray are not what Ray Allen was. But I'm cool with adding them if you okay adding other 3 and D specialists."
Laker fans get to watch Anthony Davis drop 40 while he pretends to be Leonardo DiCaprio. 2 Wins.
Anthony Day-to-Davis
In the playoffs Anthony Davis puts his injuries aside and puts his team first. Unlike Chris Paul.
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."
Anthony Davis if you count his one year at Kentucky with his early NBA seasons. He was a defensive big and developed into a nearly unstoppable offensive player.
"""I would never want my son to play for Boston after what they done to Isaiah Thomas,"" the elder Davis said. ""No loyalty. Guy gives his heart and soul and they traded him.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2818840-anthony-davis-father-rips-celtics-for-no-loyalty-with-isaiah-thomas"
"I know a lot of people knocked him when he first came into the league for his defensive deficiencies (he's always been a skilled scorer), and I'm not saying that he's Anthony Davis on that end, but he's become a serviceable defender who finally seems to know how to use his body. I've appreciated watching his growth."
Defense wins championships if you have lebron james and anthony davis to run your offense.
"You do realize when you have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on your team, even guys like Drummond will be free to score at certain possessions  Won't even comment about Bron. Bron scores at will against any team"
"Whether they LeBron fans or not they have a huge platform.Absolutely he played horrible at times against Denver but answer me this give me another player we asked to be the number one on Offense, the tip of the spear defensively, and lead his team and assist? LeBron despite how people claim he carries he’s never had to be a defense stopper he always had someone like Shane Battier who allows him the rest on the D. Look at who had a guard Jimmy Butler Anthony Davis took up the challenge He doesn’t even play that position."
you realize actual plus minus stats have never rated kd anywhere near as high as this sub does over any sort of sample?  &amp;#x200B;  Stasticlaly KD is worse than  \-&gt; Lebron  \-&gt; Curry  \-&gt; Giannis  \-&gt; Anthony Davis  \-&gt; Harden  \-&gt; Jokic  \-&gt; Kawhi  According to this sub he's magically a tier above kawhi and davis even though both are literally better versions of him in the playoffs.
Jamal Murray  Paul George  CJ McCollum  Anthony Davis  Brandon Ingram  Christian Wood  Kevin Durant / James Harden  Khris Middleton  Jaylen Brown  Russell Westbrook  Caris Levert  Nikola Vucevic  All averaged more PPG than KP
LeBron James and Anthony Davis complement each other really well.
Anthony Davis obviously typo
He's Anthony Davis without the scissors
LeBron and Davis are about as perfect a duo as you could hope for. LeBron can both manufacture his own offence and facilitate at all-time great levels. Anthony Davis is arguably the greatest off-ball big ever and is an all-time great defender.
Well now I want to see Anthony Davis with no eyebrows.
&gt;Anthony Davis was able to overcome injuries  no he hasn’t lmao
"""The Los Angeles Lakers defeat the Phoenix Suns 109-95 behind 21/6/9 from LeBron James and 34/11 from Anthony Davis to take a 2-1 series lead""  Mentioned both lebron and AD lmao what r u talking about"
Anthony Davis if he didn't get spanked in college
Porzingis seems like an Anthony Davis type - can be absolutely dominant down low but chooses not to because it's hard / exhausting
"Yes he can, he’s a good one on one defender but what he struggles with is help defense. Anthony Davis against Deandre Ayton: 10-26 (38%)"
"Nerlens ""Anthony Davis"" Noel. Living at the line right now"
"I mean it depends on the player, even if it's a star. Like Anthony Davis made a non-playoff team a contender.   With that being said, if we're just not including top 10 players, maybe Mavs will continue to surprise this post-season, but they're the first team that comes to mind."
`Anthony Davis -- 2020 WCSF v Warriors`  When did this happen? Warriors weren't even in 2020 playoffs?
That’s cause of Anthony davis
Yeah just have a long athletic big who can keep up at the perimeter but still rotate down to protect the paint like Anthony Davis or Giannis.
But players like anthony Davis wear them - that's why I'm curious
"The Lakers did a great job of showing how to guard Jimmy Buckets. Because he is a poor 3 point shooter we stuck a long athletic big (Anthony Davis) and it pretty much nullified his shot making. That Big just needs to play off 3 feet and force him into three point shots. When you sag off him he won't get around you.    Now, this won't work as well if you have a slower big. And we are seeing a awful performance because Giannis might be the best combo of length and athletics to stop Butler. The perfect man for the job"
Remember when Anthony Davis body checked him to the ground and it wasn't called? Let's not pretend the Lakers are angels here.
"This is probably the one of the best replies so far.   The Ben part doesn't really answer that part. I think Ben is a generational talent and everytime I say that l get razzed. Do people really think he's bad just because he can't shoot?  Andre Drummond, l see people say he clogs the paint for Davis, but that's kinda rare. The past 3 season Anthony Davis has taken more post fades, high post fades, and 3 pointers. I think you are correct when talking about Bron who slashes more. You are 100% correct about his offense, and stopping PnR."
Anthony Davis limps so many times that it makes sense why one would think it's serious but it looked worrisome when he went to the lockerroom.
"pretty sure if you swapped luka and lebron, luka would look just as good with anthony davis as lebron does except he can play more minutes"
Reminder that ADs nickname is Anthony Day-to-Davis

"If I were the Phoenix Suns, I would simply play better defense on Anthony Davis and the Lakers by not fouling them so much. But it's easier to say refs."
Why does Clint Capela shoot less free throws than Anthony Davis? He’s rim running.
Stop fouling Anthony Davis then.  He's the one shooting them all

"Can’t even touch Anthony Davis without a foul being called, soft ass bitch"
"Anthony Davis is a problem, who knew"
People had their doubts but that mid playoff trade of Antonio Beavis for Anthony Davis is looking pretty smart right now.
"But I thought he was Daffy Davis.  Fuck, you’re telling me Anthony Davis is good!?"
LMAO find someone who loves you as much as this dude loves bitching about Anthony Davis on the Lakers. Bro the Lakers aren't even the most problematic super team in the league THIS YEAR
The league really did give Anthony Davis Lebron James
This subs opinion of Anthony Davis and most players in general is the most reactionary shit on the planet
This Anthony Davis fella seems like a pretty skilled individual!
"Anthony Davis is Snorlax, confirmed."
Anthony “Anthony Davis” Davis
"Yah he has a bad game and it's suddenly   ""Is Anthony Davis even top 20?"""
Anthony davis is good.
This subs take on Anthony Davis is historically awful 😂😂😂😂
"im glad its a no call  but i have seen that ""body bump"" called 10000x for anthony davis to get him free throws. such a BS foul"
"Holy shit, what is Anthony Davis doing right now?  He's playing *so fucking bad*"
"Anthony ""Andre Drummond"" Davis"
"This is exactly how it was last season. Anthony Davis carrying most of the load, and then LeBron getting all the credit at the end of the season"
If Lebron and Anthony Davis didnt get injured lakers would've been the 1st seed this season
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"It is, but he’s not Lebron or Anthony Davis losing Chris Paul will make this a gentlemen sweep with Chris Paul could have gone 6 or 7 but in the end Lakers still win this series."
Lmao they really gave LeBron prime Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis with a quiet 30 points
Anthony Davis is dad dicking the suns
Not really sure why u would think that one team has Lebron and Anthony Davis and as you have seen in this third quarter they’re kinda fucking game changers.
ANTHONY DAVIS
"I feel bad, you'd think Anthony Davis could afford a mirror and a razor."
LeBron turning it on in 2021 isn't the same as it was in 2018 or even earlier. He has Anthony damn Davis when him.
Anthony Davis imo... Still a beast though
Laker fans dont want to hear if but Anthony Davis is the softest player in the league. He gets injured tying his shoelaces
Anthony “I don’t want the ball” Davis
Why is Anthony davis just floating around the 3pt line ALL the time on offense?? I've never seen an almost 7ft player so allergic to playing in the paint. The guy is a fucking soft ball of garbage!!
Ayton just sonning Anthony Davis every time down the floor.
Anthony Davis gets tapped on the nose by ayton on the way down and the announcers are making it sound like a life threatening injury. Lmao
"very entertaining, Anthony Davis getting clocked in the nose"
is anthony davis more like robert mchale or hakeem olajuan?   discuss:
Why does Deandre Ayton not simply eat Anthony Davis?
Imagine being as soft as Anthony davis. You cant even walk down a flight of stairs without falling over and suffering a lower leg injury. Also hes been getting manhandled by ayton which is disgraceful considering davis is on a max contract
Can anthony davis just get sent over to the WNBA?? That league is about at his toughness level and he may only get one or two injuries a year there.
imagine have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on your roster and crying about flopping and whining to the refs
Anthony Davis is a lil bitch
How can you be almost 7ft tall and as soft as davis?? Never thought it was possible until I watched the last game when he was on the ground half of the time. The guy is made of glass I've seen seen soap bubbles that are tougher than anthony davis
Anthony Davis got hit and fell again no way what a surprise
"""looks like Anthony Davis is alright"" just the usual lol"
"""Looks like Anthony Davis is alright""   Truly shocking stuff"
Anthony Davis probably gets hurt getting out of bed. Last game he spend most of the game on the floor. He should get no foul calls until he stop the blatant flopping
After seeing Anthony Davis take that slight elbow to the face there’s a chance he could be died.
Anthony Davis is soft. that's no reason to roll around and cry on the floor. This happens every game with him man.
"If I were to fight Anthony Davis I would yell a multiplication problem at him, and he’d probably collapse in mental frustration and hire a mercenary to fight for him."
There's the Anthony Davis we all know and love
I kinda think it was worth. A foul on Anthony Davis is def worth a challenge.
Anthony Davis and fouling Jae Crowder within 15 seconds of a game’s start. Name a more iconic duo.
"Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, Marvin Bagley"
NBA is the only sport where you can acquire 1 player and go from a lotto team to a title contender. There is a reason the Lakers for instance dumped 3 prospects and a bunch of picks for Anthony Davis.
Basically just directly mentioned Anthony Davis’s account and said “Hey man put your hand out” acting like the hand in the picture is Davis’s and Davis is getting a “Mickey Mouse ring” or whatever
"They’re implying it was easy for a team with Lebron and Anthony Davis, not for any team in the league"
Anthony Davis is out for blood. He's been performing as expected.
My point being theres been big men with great stats that didn't translate to winning. Kevin love Anthony davis are also examples of this
Anthony Davis
"Russ is one of my favorite guards all time. Consistently a top 10-15 player in the league throughout his career. This season though, putting him right at 25 is generous. Here’s the 24 players I have before him, and I can’t see there being an argument he outplayed any of them this year:  Joker embiid curry Durant  harden Giannis Chris Paul Devin Booker Ja morant  Kyrie Irving  Dame Ben Simmons  Rudy gobert Donovan Mitchell  Trey Young  Luka Kawhi  LeBron Anthony Davis Jayson Tatum Sabonis  Bradley Beal PG-13 Khris Middleton   That would put him at 25. I think a case could be made that Jimmy Butler or Bam would be more deserving of this spot. Also you’d have to put Jaylen Brown and Jamal Murray higher if they weren’t injured."
[Anthony Davis] WE OUT
You should say that to Anthony Davis when he's rolling around crying after someone lightly bumps him LMFAO
Anthony Scissors Davis
Golf Digest is Fucking pissed!!! Watch out Anthony Davis the mob will be at your door tomorrow.
"&gt;Anthony Davis asked about LeBron: “What I saw from LeBron today, he’ll be fine. Trust me. He’ll be fine.”  They scissored, didn't they."
Anthony Davis is now a Top 5 player in the league?
Because Lebron James and Anthony Davis are on the same team. It should almost illegal for a duo like that or Curry and Durant to happen.
Step into the mind of an Anthony Davis ..  “I put the team on my back doe”
Yeah has nothing to do with seeing Anthony Davis playing like his usual self
"Thats what happens when you rely on a 22 year old &amp; Frank Kaminsky for post defense &amp; rim protection. Its problematic vs a big like Anthony Davis, especially when hes aggressive."
Multiple people in that thread unironically were saying they would rather have Julius Randle than Anthony Davis.   It feels like a significant portion of this sub doesn't watch basketball.
This for r/nba to stfu with their bad takes. Anthony mother fucking Davis ladies and gentlemen
"Injured forward Anthony Davis yelled, “There you go!” Sharpshooter KCP gave a look of pleasant surprise. Center Marc Gasol belted, “We got an \[expletive\] squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-Parks&amp;Rec star Rob Pelinka hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Anthony Davis.   Teams do not want to face a healthy AD. Hes simply unguardable
ANTHONY DAVIS
ANTHONY DAVIS
#Maybe the Anthony Davis AMA was productive after all!

Anthony Davis is Phoenix’s unibrowed ghost of playoff future.
Anthony Davis woke up and remembered it's almost playoff time

anthony davis does not have good standupability
Anthony Day to Davis.
yeah I'm thinking Anthony Davis is back
As Anthony Davis does a full body dive for the ball on his bum ankle
"Nah, it's gonna be Lakers fans acting like a regular season victory is proof that Anthony Davis can lead a championship team"
This Anthony Davis guy is kinda good.
Every team is screwed. It's Lebron and Anthony Davis are on the same team for Christ's sake.
Anthony Davis is single handedly ass blasting us.
"Last I checked LeBron James and Anthony Davis won a championship last year. You're severely downplaying the injury troubles the Lakers have had. It's not all relative, stop being a homer."
"Are you serious? LeBron James and Anthony Davis, two top 10 players from the defending NBA champions, isn't insanely bad injury luck to you? You're either trolling or a hater."
Anthony Davis could braid his uni… and I’m still not taking him over BaeBlade.
Yes but Lebron and Anthony Davis have been injured alot. Two of our starting centers also out and we have like 3 point guards who can't play right now all with injuries.
"Wouldn't the first question be ""what are you smoking?"" followed by ""can I have some?""   Then it would be ""in what planet?"" and a few variations of that....   Until we get to the ""Anthony Davis injury?"""
Clearly they are the favorites and scoring every time no question. My only thought is that Harden would only try on offense— and a good two way team (like Carmelo Anthony Davis) might be able to put up a good fight. Or Bill Russell Westbrook.
Donovan Mitchel I understand but do you genuinely believe Conley has even close to as big of an impact for the Jazz as either Lebron James or Anthony Davis? Lose Gobert and see how your winning percentage gets affected. Plus isn't Conley an injury prone player LOL. AD has won more championships during his lakers tenure than the jazz have won in their entire history. Enjoy the regular season accolades because they sure as hell won't translate into the playoffs.
"If I had a dollar for every NYer living in LA who told me, ""NY is way better than LA except for the weather,"" I'd be living next door to Anthony Davis in Bel-Air."
"For the Lakers I would say  Lebron James  Anthony Davis  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  &amp;#x200B;  I have multiple favorite teams, don’t judge"
The one he sold was [also 16k sq/ft but had 5 rooms](https://therealdeal.com/la/2021/01/04/lakers-anthony-davis-sells-mansion-for-1m-less-than-he-paid/) lol. Pretty ridiculous.  Used to live near that city. I'm still surprised when I read about these houses. They must be hidden because it looks like a normal upscale suburb when driving through.
"You're missing a lot of context here though.  The warchest was big early in seasons due to Memphis pick and sac pick looking very valuable only to fall due to late runs by both teams.  Alot of the trades involving picks for stars involved trading jaylen or jayson and that still doesn't look wise long term.  We did trade part of our chest for kyrie which people seem to forget. That was a huge trade.  Grant and Romeo haven't had the best seasons but I'm pretty forgiving of that tbh given all the circumstances.  Kembas nagging knee injury meant we were without a point guard for ages.  This is a shit season but we're still a good team.  Have had more days lost to covid than 10 teams combined, ongoing injuries for key players, no off season and no camp for our very young team but we didnt trade for anthony davis or kawhi or paul george who were all LA bound so oh boy let's fire danny ainge or brad Stevens."
Pretty sure Anthony Davis also tripped and got hurt on one at the clippers
The one thing I think Drummond has is the mass to not get backed down by embiid if the finals goes that way. I don't think anyone else Anthony Davis included can defend Embiid in the post as well.
They don't though.   Sabonis can't guard 4s at all. turner really can' tbe on the perimeter... he has improved a ton but he is a rim protecting 5. He isn't say... Anthony Davis or Giannis. He isn't that athletic.   Turner doens't shoot THAT well that he stretches the floor enough. Teams gladly let him fire away (he is way too streaky). and he is horrible at backing down and posting up smaller players. So teams just put the big dude on Sabonis to bang and put whoever on Turner because he can't punish them.   Sabonis needs a unicorn next to him... an AD/Giannis type... or like J Grant or JJJ. And there are like 5 of them int he whole league.   You either have to live with the shit defense and put Sabo at the 5 and hope the outscore teams... or you have to live with absolute miserable rebounding with Turner at the 5.   Turner isn't as good as Sabonis but his player type (rim protecting 5 who can shoot decent) is much mcuh much much much easier to team build with than a 5 who is terrible on defense. You have to be Jokic elite on offense to get away with that.
Anthony Davis when He was on the NOLA Hornets/Pelicans? He only made 2 Playoff Appearance
"Barkley and KG still ahead of Giannis but Anthony Davis, Giannis and Zion definitely have a shot at entering the Top 5."
"The entire league has been battling injuries and what not the whole season. Why does this matter?   Like even if you think the Lakers are better for example, you played them 3 times without Anthony Davis.   (By the way, Thunder had PG as well in 2019)"
Anthony Davis maybe
Reminder that Anthony Davis shot this man in cold blood
&gt; Pascal isn't better but they aren't very far apart either  my first comment in this thread of nonsense  pascal has shown a level of consistency that puts him obviously below anthony davis but to say they're worlds apart is dumb and uninformed
Anthony Davis? That’s hilarious
"Marc Gasol, Tim Duncan, Anthony Davis, among others."
"Anthony Davis has a ring which is automatically better than half the players you’ve listed. Him being the 1b for the playoff run makes him better than the other players you’ve listed who do have a ring.   I think 52nd is high, don’t get me wrong. But he’s close."
"The media darling, refuse-to-play-center, son of American media Anthony Davis gets to swing between forward and center whenever he wants depending on which position has the weaker competition when trying to get all NBA teams, Embijd can do the same too"
Better than fucking Anthony Davis this season
It’s time to acknowledge that Kelly Olynyk has had a better season than Anthony Davis
He literally only had one injury his rookie year that kept him out of the first four months of the season. Someone who is hurt a lot is like Anthony Davis who always seems to have little niggles every season.
"I feel more optimistic given that Anthony Davis continues playing better and better. Soon, LeBron will back and so we will make some noise given our easier triplet of games. Come to think of it, I'm so disappointed in Shroder."
Dirk and Anthony Davis would be starting centers against each other in the playoffs.  Worlds different than his prime era.
"Jordan had pippen (who was a top 5 mvp candidate without Jordan), Lebron had wade, kyrie and Anthony Davis), wilt had west, Kareem had almost everyone.   It’s a team sport and the last individual superstar to win was dirk who I have in tier three.   Takes a team to be successful, including elite sidekicks  Edit: for me tier three is good enough to be the best player on a championship team, but not transendent."
"Compared to similar lists that have been posted to r/NBA, this one is not bad at all. The criteria is interesting and it clearly takes work and dedication to do something so indepth, so kudos! Personally, I have a few main points of disagreement:  1) I feel like Anthony Davis is way too high. 52nd best player of all time? C'mon. He's an incredible player that can certainly get to that level, but putting him above Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Tracy McGrady, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Dominique Wilkins, and almost 50 spots up on current players like Joel Embiid, Klay Thompson, and Nikola Jokic is bonkers.   2) Carmelo is *way* too low. 10th (about to be 9th) all time scorer, 10 all star appearances, a scoring title, 12 playoff appearances, and 6 all nba selections -- that is an insane career. Putting players such as Dwight Howard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, and Tracy McGrady above him makes no sense -- at least not statistically.   3) Why isn't Luka on the players too young right now? You have Devin Booker (age 24), Ben Simmons (age 24), and Jayson Tatum (age 23) on that list -- how is Luka's career someone more definable at 22? Simmons and Tatum have 2 and 3 playoff appearances respectively, Luka has 1. Could Luka be a top 10 player of all time in 10 years? Absolutely! But if you're looking at longevity and accolades, why is he above Kyle Lowry, Bradley Beal, and Demar Derozen?  Anyway -- cool list! I had a good time looking over it."
"I mean, when basically every single draft analyst worth their salt was also saying he was easily the best prospect since at least Anthony Davis you absolutely can blame people."
"Same reason why Anthony Davis, who preached all last year that he wasnt a center, made the all-nba 1st team as a center."
"Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sabonis, Lamar Odom, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, Andrea Bargnani, Boris Diaw, Nikola Jokic, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony-Towns, Bam Adebayo, Rasheed Wallace, Kevin Love, Nikola Vucevic and more all have fadeaway jumpers in their bag."
So this is a better start than Anthony Davis?
Better than Anthony Davis
"No, the Pelicans are, without doubt, a bottom tier team. They barely made the playoffs with Anthony Davis, for gods sake. It’s not even a debate at this point."
True.  But what you DO get is Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the first round. Good luck.
*sigh*  You're really out here forcing me to defend Anthony Davis?
"Yeah i agree, also Anthony Davis just murders us every single time. Guy must have got bullied at school by a Nugs fan or something. He scares me like the Kings and the Warriors scare me."
"Trust me, as a Houston fan, I felt that way before this year too.   Turns out, if James Harden or Anthony Davis doesn’t want to play for you, he just won’t, and he’ll hurt your org (purposefully or not) while he does it.  If teams thought those situations were salvageable, *they wouldn’t trade the player.* If you’re negotiating a trade to give up a top 20 guy, it’s because there is no alternative.  In Boston’s case (your example, again), they could’ve got several years from those players *and then moved them for value* when they realized they probably couldn’t retain them.   Or they could’ve used the value they’d already accumulated to be more aggressive in acquiring the talent that came available.  They didn’t do either of the last two, and that’s the problem, which you seem to just be ignoring.  They didn’t continue acquiring assets, and then they never used the assets they had. Ainge handled it like garbage. Don’t point to him."
Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. I really wasn’t expecting KD to be THIS good considering the fact that he had a major injury and hadn’t played in an year and a half. AD has been super disappointing for me. The fact that the team is still relying on Lebron more than AD speaks for it self.

"damn that’s crazy it’s almost like he had a DPOY candidate and perennial superstar on his team. Do you think Anthony Davis is joe ingles or some shit? This is why people don’t like playing with Bron, never get credit. Anthony Davis aint no joe shmuck he averaged 28/10 in the playoffs that year. Put some respect"
"His Finals trips were in the east with superteams when he didn’t go up against superstars. East was trash. Yeah he made it last year in the west but he did it with a top 5 player. James Harden and even Anthony Davis would shit on the East too from 2011-2017 especially if they had other stars with them. The West had the Lakers, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Spurs, Rockets, Thunder, Pelicans, Trailblazers, Lob City Clippers, Warriors... way harder teams than than the Bulls, Wizards, Hawks, Magic, Pacers, Celtics, Raptors. Guaranteed if Bron was in the West his whole career he maybe makes the Finals 2-3 times. Those western teams were straight killers and clawed at each others throats"
I think people forget some of the dog shit rosters the Pelicans had during his time. Everybody seems to think he had prime Jrue Holiday the entire time.   I was in another thread a couple days ago and somebody posted his game in 2016 that had the 8th highest game score ever in the NBA. [The starting lineup consisted of:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201602210DET.html)  Anthony Davis  Dante Cunningham  Norris Cole  Bryce Dejean-Jones  Omer Asik
"Smh it was bad over Paul George, but so much worse over the shot-blocking prowess of Anthony Davis. Will Dame's shooting ever find its stride in this league?"
Lakers are plagued by injuries to their most important players. Anthony Davis is made of glass. If he stubs his toe on a beanbag chair he misses a months worth of games.
What happened? He needed Anthony Davis another top 5 player.  Also Lebron &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jimmy
I just remembered anthony davis so thats honestly fair
Or Caruso on the final possession taking a fadeaway instead of passing to Anthony Davis.
Two things happen when Anthony Davis is the best player in your team 1. He will put up numbers 2. You will lose
Anthony Davis can't win with these cats.
no shit. i’m pointing out how it’s funny he’s calling out anthony davis for flopping when damian lillard flops too
"Kyle Kuzma coming up big for the Trailblazers.  I mean, come on.  Anthony Davis is working his ass off on both ends of the floor in these final minutes with some huge plays and Kuzma just throws away a possession like that with a rushed shot."
Wonder how many times Doris Burke had said Anthony Davis this game
Anthony Davis is a floppy vagina
Anthony Davis goes over the back to get the rebound and then flops for the free foul. Amazing.
"Which one. The one he won with Anthony Davis? Or the one he won with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love? Or was it either of the ones he won with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh?  Replace Jimmy Butler with any player, even a clone of Lebron James, in that final against the Lakers and you think that player would win the finals against a Lakers team of Lebron James + Anthony Davis lmao?"
I'm still worried we'll get the Lakers and get a nice ole double teaming from Anthony Davis and the refs
"Lakers still have Anthony Davis, even if he is a bit off the pace."
Lakers fans complaining about that call like they don't employ Anthony Davis is next level cognitive dissonance
"&gt;LeBron James has missed 23 games this season, (65% of total games so far).   &gt;Anthony Davis has missed 35 games this season (47% of total games so far).  Your math needs work lol"
"We're talking about playoffs. He's ALWAYS shot better from distance in the playoffs versus regular season. Every damn year, just [look at his numbers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html). He buckles down with his shot selection in the postseason, doesn't force as much as does during the regular season, and picks and chooses his spots depending on each matchup. The Warriors are smaller up front? Can try to force more action at the rim. The Rockets didn't have big guys to match up? More opportunities to force inside. Mix it up with mid-range looks to keep them honest. The Nuggets have Jokic and other bigs to bang down low? Face-up in no-man's land from 16 extended and take advantage of the space.   The looks he got with the Lakers were very different from what he had to work with in any playoff series with the Pelicans. He was hot, but it wasn't some extreme outlier that was unprecedented given that he was playing with the best postseason team he's ever had on a contender with LeBron James as the focal point. The fact that he was making difficult looks? Fair. His overall efficiency? Not really. LeBron James is a damn good player that soaps up a lot of defensive attention and makes things easier for a guy like Anthony Davis."
"Yeah, how are people missing this entirely? AD was already a great playoff performer in the limited games we saw of him with the Pelicans. Stick him on a team alongside LeBron James and it's not so ridiculous that he'd be even better with the best spacing of his career AND having improved in two years. He's one of the most talented two way players in the league, how is it unthinkable that he'd be able to take his game to another level when healthy AND playing alongside one of the greatest of all time?   Unless he's literally playing in the same exact circumstances, you can't just go off a spreadsheet when making a conclusion like the OP. Anthony Davis shot incredibly well throughout the postseason, but it's not like it was some extreme outlier ala Jamal Murray for the Nuggets."
The amount of excuses people make for Giannis and Embiid while trying to underplay Anthony Davis.   Come on now.
"Anthony Davis did, what are you on he was shouting ""we back"" after the game look it up. Thats why yall getting clowned"
"Giannis is Anthony Davis, not LeBron"
"Yep. Unless you're pelicans or okc a la Paul George, jrue holiday, or Anthony davis"

Sure. The Lakers didn't lose because Anthony Davis is papermade and LeBron passed the ball to shooters missing everything instead of trying to take over the game himself (with a nagging ankle injury)
Steph Curry/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Giannis Antetokounmpo/Anthony Davis
"Probably the same reason[ AD has waited 8 years so far](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/3/21/11277978/anthony-davis-injury-shoulder-torn-labrum-3-years) to have his torn labrum fixed. It's risky, time consuming, and sometimes you might be able to get through it without surgery."
Laker's were never a championship contender  without Anthony Davis.
This is the worst take. We missed the playoffs the prior season with pretty much that roster. We weren’t making the leap to champions in 1 offseason. You know what did though? Trading for Anthony Davis.
"Also had randle and mirotic who were solid there in NO  I always call BS when people say NO didnt try and ""failed"" helping Anthony Davis. They for sure did try and help out AD but injuries always were a plague for his years there with him and other players around him"
Anthony Davis when he plays PF
"&gt;let me get this straight... you're essentially saying that trading for Davis was a loss for the Lakers?  It might be.  We won't really know for a decade or so, when we know more about how much, exactly, they gave up to rent one player for one season.  We do know that they paid more for that rental than any team in NBA history.  They paid more than it cost Brooklyn to trade for two years of James Harden.  Do you think Davis is more than twice as good as James Harden?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And you refer to Davis as a rental when he signed a 5 year max?  Yes, because they signed him to that deal as an unrestricted free agent last December.  Any team -- including the Lakers -- could have done so, regardless of where he played in 2020.  This fact is something you should be aware of, if you are going to participate in this discussion.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, told Sports Illustrated's S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   “Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.”   &gt;   &gt;https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors"
"Lol people on this sub think that guys can just play through these debilitating injuries because a series is on the line, it just doesn’t work that way. See: Anthony Davis attempting to gut out a groin strain. Harden missed like 20 games with the hammy and tweaked it on a very unassuming play. Dude isn’t playing this series"
&gt;He already is better than Anthony Davis  put down the crack buddy.
"He already is better than Anthony Davis. James Harden though? Eh, win 2 more titles"
"I agree with the definition of what a generational talent is, and would reassert my position that placing three players on same team with said generational talent requires nothing more than telling players to score. There is no need for a method for this years Nets team. Barring some unforeseen change, they hang a banner.    The additional conversation of the pre-KD Warriors team is interesting to me. Yes, I would would agree that Steph is and was then a superstar, but you entirely left out 2014-15 All-Star Klay Thompson. The Warriors had the “Big 3” approach prior to KD. Let’s not sell their talent pool short. Also, Draymond is undersized at the 4, much like Barkley in his Suns days, but was also on a tear defensively that led to his 16-17 DPOY trophy. He was also runner-up for DPOY in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. Again, they were an absolutely stacked team.  Again, my conversation was set to show that perhaps there is another shift in the league that will impact the way teams are built and developed. Unfortunately, the harsh truth is that as long as superstar talent teams with multiple All-Stars are successful on winning championships, big names will continue to try and manipulate the league into fitting this format. See Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.   The other side shows that teams like Portland have tried to maintain their identities, but don’t have anything to show for it. Balanced talent needs solid leadership and good coaching. It is much easier for a GM to win a championship by hollowing out small market teams than to build through development. See again Kawhi Leonard single handedly killing the Spurs."
That’s not much you can do if he pulls an Anthony Davis or harden. You’re better off not losing them for nothing
Anthony Davis. Giannis bam
anthony davis?
"I agree, the Nuggets should be more competitive in this series and could have picked up at least 1 win by now. But they are frankly outmatched by this Suns team.  Being injured =/ being hurt. Everyone, especially at this stage of the season, is hurt. Jamal Murray physically can’t play with a torn ACL and Will Barton is taking a legit risk playing the limited minutes he is playing with a strained hamstring. Chris Paul is a beast but the idea that he’s just mentally tougher and that’s how he’s getting through his shoulder contusion is laughable. He’s 90% healthy and was 80% during the Lakers series. Also, it’s the pros man. Everyone wants to win. No one “wants it more” than someone else.  Every team is an injury or two away from having their season drastically change. There’s only 5 guys on the court for one team. Do you not remember the Phoenix vs LA series that just happened? That series changed dramatically depending on if Chris Paul and/or Anthony Davis was playing.   The Suns are truly a fantastic team and I’m rooting for them to win it all after they beat Denver. I grew up being a fan of the Nash and Stoudemire teams. But the way you talk about basketball is baffling. When you say things like Chris Paul has the heart of a champion or the Nuggets don’t have the heart or the Nuggets are soft, you remind me of Skip Bayless in [this](https://youtu.be/xRaO1mN5EEM) video. It’s a just a dumb way to talk about sports."
"Yep, New Orleans *finally* hired their own training and medical staff back in the summer of 2019 after literally years of just borrowing the football guys from the Saints. I've always felt like them not using actual basketball experts was a big part of why so many of their players got hurt every year (Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Boogie Cousins, Anthony Davis, Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, etc).   As for the Suns this year, I think at least part of the credit for their health should go to the long layoffs they had last year. They had 113 days off from the stoppage in March till the bubble training camp started in July. Then they had a month of training together, played two weeks worth of games, and then got another 131 days off until this season started. Between having 9 months off like the teams that weren't invited to the bubble and only getting 6 weeks off like some teams in the bubble, I think Phoenix had an absolutely ideal setup coming into this season."

Anthony Davis or Giannis to provide rim protection and also take advantage of his passing
"man i hate seeing the slander on MPJ/Gordon  this team was missing its top 3 guards, and won a playoff series, with tons of help from them. they have played their hearts out. im sad af. but you can see the fatigue. you can see the frustration. we are down our CP3/Anthony Davis, i respect the fuck outta our effort to get this far. we be back next year, hopefully healthy, and kickin some ass"
Anthony Davis is the same way
Anthony Davis and Embiid both fall down way too much I know ther when your shoot and stuff it’s safer than landing sometimes but holy shit the two of them can’t be doing their bodies favours especially Embiid he goes down recklessly sometimes for blocks
Anthony Davis would like a word
"Serge ""Anthony ""Chris Paul"" Davis"" Ibaka"
Danny Green in Anthony Davis clothes - not a good sign.
"... You literally just argued that being better at defending and rebounding automatically makes Rodman the better player.  Davis is an 8 time All-Star with 4 All-NBA 1st team selections at 28 years old.  He has already received 17x as many MVP votes as Rodman did in his career.  In his prime he has consistently been a top 10 player, sometimes arguably top 5.  He's not just better, he's *much* better.  It's not even close.  You're telling me that you would take Dennis Rodman over Anthony Davis if you had the #1 pick in the draft?"
At least Anthony Davis figured out a way to make money off of his unibrow.. what the fuck is Trae Young doing holding onto that horrible mop. Tryin to get a cotton candy sponsor?
I'm glad you said he's not that close because he's not. Anthony Davis was our best playoff player last year for 3 out of 4 series. LeBron did best in the finals but that doesn't mean those first 3 series AD wasn't out MVP.  LeBron at his peak was unstoppable. This LeBron is very stoppable.
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
And Anthony Davis while we are at it lol
"&gt;I will be arguing that the Lakers were not definitely been better off with trading for Anthony Davis and rather than developing their young core around LeBron.  If you're going to write an essay, you need to learn how sentences work."
"The 2009 Cavaliers supporting cast wasn't great to begin with, but 2011 was a complete mess by comparison, which is saying something. Beyond Antawn Jamison, who again only appeared in 56 games, the Cavs' leading scorer that year was J.J. Hickson (unless one wishes to count Baron Davis and his 15 appearances).   Winning 66 games in 2009 with that roster was amazing in itself, but I believe it's a bit disingenuous to say the non-LeBron skill level of that team was the same by 2011. Perhaps the 2K version of the roster looked nice-ish (Baron Davis, Antawn Jamison, Mo Williams... even then it's not great). But most of those guys missed either the majority of the season or close to it. Here's a list of Cavaliers who played 57 games or more in 2011:  * J.J. Hickson (80)  * Ramon Sessions (81)  * Anthony Parker (72)  * Daniel Gibson (67)  * Ryan Hollins (70)  That's it.   The season was basically run as a AAA or AA baseball campaign, where *17* different players appeared in 20 games or more, where losing served as a happy accident, and where the notable guys who generally would have contributed well couldn't stay on the floor.   The nightly skill level of that team, even outside of LeBron, was drastically different than anything rolled out there during LeBron's tenure."
"YES hopefully the medical staff agrees. I hope Donovan doesn't push it. These players don't always know what is best. Donovan is very young though and his body should hopefully heal fast. I just don't want a situation like Anthony Davis where he was injured, played through the injury and injured himself more. And the Jazz are better without Donovan than the Lakers were without AD. You're up 2-0 with a LOT of playoff games to play. Rest up spider!"
"This is hard because of the 1st team SF line up....I wanted to put LeBron, but then there's KD. But LeBron can play any position basically, so imma just put him at PF.   **1st team:**  PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: LeBron James  C: Dwight Howard   **2nd team:**  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kawhii Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Marc Gasol  **3rd team:**  PG: Russell Westbrook  SG: DeMar DeRozan  SF: Paul George  PF: Giannis  C: Joel Embiid"
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"

"Or even better - NOLA Anthony Davis role with Jrue/Middleton, Giannis at center Bucks would be unstoppable I dont understand why Lopez is in the game when KD can attack him every possession"
How do you feel about former pelican Anthony Davis winning a ring last season?
"Okay but you had months of rest before the bubble last season. So you guys were rested and healthy. The fact is Anthony Davis is injury prone, so that’s gonna be something you deal with the rest of his career. LeBron is also aging, so his body will wear down too.   Even with AD, you guys were gonna struggle with Phoenix. The defense was good, but the offense was horrific and you barely had any spacing.   You can’t bring back the same group next season and expect to beat teams like Brooklyn or Phoenix or Utah or Denver."
"Using that logic, Anthony Davis can’t lead a team."
"For now.  Locks:  LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Doncic (international ticket), Marc Gasol, Dwight Howard.  Possibly get in:  Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Damian Lillard, Draymond Green (considering how long Rodman and Big Ben get inducted), LaMarcus Aldridge (yeah, just retired), Kawhi Leonard, Rajon Rondo, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, Al Horford, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love"
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   —————————————   **Who’s *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
Blake Griffin literally became Anthony Davis
https://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/injury-report-210218-anthony-davis-calf  Here's his injury report for the season. He got his first injury in February.
OK so you guys are saying Kyrie is one of the best 15 players in the league.  So which of these is he better than:  Durant   Harden   Giannis  Kawhi  Embiid  Mitchell  Doncic   Jokic  Lebron  Dame  Anthony Davis  Curry  Jimmy Butler  Westbrook  Beal
He literally claimed he has never been on a super team after losing to Golden State the third time.  After having created two at that point and shortly before he would leave for LA and aggressively recruit Anthony Davis.
Giannis and Anthony Davis actively hurt their teams by not playing like big men
http://www.prosportstransactions.com/basketball/Search/SearchResults.php?Player=Anthony+Davis&amp;Team=&amp;BeginDate=&amp;EndDate=&amp;InjuriesChkBx=yes&amp;Submit=Search&amp;start=0  Now lets look at the games that he did miss to injury and not lets pretend he's not injury prone. This is every single injury he has had since his NBA debut with the New Orleans Hornets in 2013.
"Assuming Klay comes back, if there's a good fit, they should trade him. The window is now for Steph Klay and Dray to win another ring.   I believe in Wiseman, and think he will be an all star, but he won't be there in the next two years. If they could give him up (and the pick) for a legit needle mover they should.   But the problem is, who can you get? Maybe Turner or Sabonis, are they good enough to get you back to a ring? Idk. Vuc? Siakam?   There's not a lot of good options, no Anthony Davis type top tier big looking to flee a crummy team who might as well get some picks/young talent for a rebuild while they can.  So yes, but no."
"Nah, the Spurs in 03 when Tim Duncan played like Anthony Davis on steroids weren’t boring"
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Six plus three is nine. James and Davis have each won a single championship in Los Angeles: one 🏆, one 🏆. In addition James and Davis represent two very tall men who tower over those around them 🤔. LeBron in his most recent social media post was spotted flying on an airplane ✈️ with Davis. LeBron James had the talent to be drafted into the NBA 🏀 at eleven years old. Anthony Davis has a single eyebrow 😟 nine inches long.  Once you step back and evaluate all the information we have available to us it's quite clear what's happened in the past and what will continue to happen if those of us who see the big picture remain silent about it."
"Same can be said of Anthony Davis, who is a much better player."
Not when you have Anthony Davis
"I don't know about Reggie Miler. I'd take Manu over him. Probably take Anthony Davis over Dominique, too.  Great list, though."
"It is possible that it was the player that rushed the return. Similar to Anthony Davis, but it is true that it’s up to the medical staff to stop them."
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
Anthony Davis is expected to stay in his street clothes
1 injured Chris Paul = 1 Anthony Davis and 1 LeBron James that weren’t fully healthy?  Is this statement above true?
The thing is Jokic is the most dominant when they send double teams to him. The problem is the Suns don't need to do that with Ayton defending. Ayton is buff and he can defend straight up. Same formula happened with the Lakers and Anthony Davis down the stretch. It's a huge problem for the Nuggets.
Nobody is talking about the Anthony Davis snub?
"If he was really the king, he would have taken 3 and made Anthony Davis wear 6."
That pretty much is the epitome of Anthony Davis
"This bit from the OP's article seems to speak to the truth of what you're saying:  &gt; One executive in the NBA said Walker isn't the only player to have those negative feelings toward Ainge, as players around the league have not trusted Celtics management during the Ainge era. Perhaps the most telling public example of that reputation came when Anthony Davis' father said he would never want his son to play for the Celtics after how they handled Isaiah Thomas' injury and departure."
"&gt;Lol, I go to the doctor every 6 weeks.  Anthony Davis?!?!  &gt;proudly 6 foot flat in socks.   Oh, never mind.  (No one make a Joel Embiid joke, please)"
"Did you just believe PG? Do you really think the FO wouldn't have tried to get Anthony Davis if he was available? We ask for AD, they ask for PG. We had no pieces."
C’mon we gonna act like anybody had a shot at AD in free agency? Anthony Davis wasn’t going anywhere but LA as soon as he signed with Klutch. His dad said all that shit so Ainge wouldn’t pull the trigger on a trade
"Sometimes, its the system and not the coach.  When they had PG, they refused to bring in I think it was Anthony Davis because of money.  You can't just have a coach and ok talent, you need a coach and beyond good talent.  Look at the Nets."
Yes that’s what happened lol here’s an article on it https://sports.yahoo.com/anthony-davis-lebron-james-no-23-jersey-number-lakers-nike-nba-234751067.html
https://www.google.ca/amp/s/fansided.com/2020/12/06/lebron-james-number-change-anthony-davis-next-season/amp/
It was reported on a lot when AD came over Edit: https://sports.yahoo.com/anthony-davis-lebron-james-no-23-jersey-number-lakers-nike-nba-234751067.html
"Anthony Davis for Wiggins, who says no?"
&gt; Anthony Davis is expected to remain No. 3.  3-6 mafi- wait…
Anthony Davis. Luka and JJJ were my top 2 prospects in 2018 draft and I'm still believer
"Like a less extreme version of Anthony Davis.  Went from 6'3"" guard to 6'10"" in one year and didn't lose any of his skills/coordination."
"Anthony Davis games played in each season 64, 67, 68, 61, 75, 75, 56, 62, 36  And this is supposed to be the time you are at your physical peak.  Now imagine what he’ll be like at age 28-33. Just one deep postseason run has cut his career lifespan by couple years."
"Dwyane Wade is the greatest Legacy wise where he still got some great years out of him, Anthony Davis is the most physically gifted, Kyrie is the most skilled"
"Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis over Mitchell??"
Suns fans didn't feel good about only losing by 7 in a playoff game where Anthony Davis went off for 34-10-7 while LeBron went off for 23-4-9?
"KD, Kyrie and a bunch of role players equals a super team?  By that definition the clippers are a super team with Kawhi and PG, right?  Lebron and anthony davis? Super team.  Giannis, middleton and holiday? Super team.  Embiid, simmons and harris? Super team.   It's one thing to wax teams with all 3 guys, but harden has played 20 seconds in this series. The team is just playing their best basketball of the season at the right time. To call the KD and Kyrie pairing unfair for the rest of the league is funny when one guy is coming back from an achillies injury and the other is supposedly the NBA's biggest cancer."
"He needs to play more like Anthony Davis. Not with the jumpshots, but less handling the ball and more accepting you are #2.  The way he plays now will never win a championship imo."
"this is such a stupid statement. oh wait, clairvoyant lebron james totally knew he was going to a team to trade everyone for anthony davis, and injured himself so that they would get the 4th fucking overall pick to make that trade possible while also predicting that the pelicans would get zion with the 1st overall pick. he also called up the 4 different teams by himself and worked the numbers out by himself after waiting patiently for 2 years for things to fall into place."
"I’m so tired of watching guys like Harden, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Embiid etc shoot 10-20 free throws a game. The NBA has absolutely no flow"
"So? We still have better assets than your team. You're stuck with an aging LeBron, Anthony Day-to-Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schroeder, with no picks. We have Wiggins who turned into a 2-way player, James Wiseman with potential still, the Minnesota pick and the 14 pick this draft. 😆"
I don’t think neither anthony davis nor kd are all nba players this season because of availability and play in the case of ad. I can see zion making it over both pg and butler
Anthony Davis
*Anthony Davis likes this*
"How is Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis not #1 in Louisiana? We hate his guts down here. And somehow Kyrie is #1?!! I suspect foul play, I demand a recount"
"LeBron too. Incoming downvotes even though he was a 1st team lock before going down with injury. inb4 ""Vogel's system"" even though every single lineup they threw out was even better with him in. inb4 ""but anthony davis"" even though AD wasn't even elite this season and LA's defensive success has hinged far more consistently on LeBron than him the last two seasons"
Anthony Davis in New Orleans.
It’s Anthony Davis
Giannis isn't in that group. Dudes a B option like Anthony Davis but worse.
"While Kenny “the jet” Smith is a great analyst, I don’t think many consider him in the goat conversation.   Reggie Jackson was pretty solid with the pistons and while he would be the goat high school player in many states, he isn’t sniffing this conversation.   Jason Williams is the goat for nasty street all stuff and I’m glad you included him.   Anthony Davis is the goat of street clothes, not basketball.   Anthony Edwards, while being a top pick, hasn’t shown enough yet to be considered a goat.   And lastly, Benjamin Franklin? You actually may be right about that one. Dude deserves to be on Mount Rushmore."
"Win shares or any cumulaltive team stats are garbage. Duncan played his entire career on great defensive teams surrounded by other DPOY players like Robinson, Bowen, and Kawhi. Not to mention how much Pop is known for being a hardass about defense. So they won a lot of games and had a top ranked defense so Duncan gets ""defensive win shares"" by proxy. Go look at the games he missed and how they performed defensively. Or how the Spurs were no longer a top defensive squad with Duncan in 2008 - 2011 after they lost Bowen and Diaw and didn't have kawhi yet.  Duncan is also not a better shot blocker than Anthony Davis. He never led the league in blocks which AD has done at least twice. Blocks per game are down across the board since the 90s/00s. So you have to look at block numbers relative to the era they're playing in.  Total rebounds or any other cumulative stat is also garbage for evaluating a player's defensive skillset. Duncan played for a long time. Of course he has more total rebounds or total blocks."
Yeah but Dame isn’t Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
"You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of the team, the other half would thrive. But you have shown me that's impossible. And as long as there are those that remember Big Baller Brand, there will always be those that are unable to accept Anthony Davis. They will resist."
Why not Anthony Davis? I might be missing or forgetting something.
If porzingis does that he's basically Anthony Davis
Giannis or Anthony Davis. Two of the only guys with almost no defensive weaknesses. Can guard any player and does everything at a good level defensively.
It’s Anthony Davis. He protects the rim like Gobert and can switch onto guards like Simmons
I would say Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis fits your description
Anthony Davis by a decent margin too. Arguably a top 5 defender all time. Modern day KG.
Anthony Davis
"Rudy Gobert or Giannis Antetokounmpo in the regular season, Anthony Davis / Draymond Green / Giannis in the postseason"
"Just checked his wiki. You are correct.   That explains why I didn't see his name even mentioned for USA.  Embiid plays for Cameroon (if he plays in international competition).  We don't have any legit big men, do we? Just Anthony Davis? And he's out obviously.   Despite what Jalen Rose said, Ayton would play for The Bahamas."
"Personally I would take anyone else in a top 5, top 10 bracket over Kawhi due to risk of injury….minus maybe Anthony Davis."
Anthony davis and maybe a healthy Jonathan isaac
ending this video with an Anthony Davis highlight was just unnecessary /u/LamarMatic
Anthony Davis is the big one who is/was injured. Outside of him the US talent is aging and the young crop of centers is increasingly international.
Anthony Davis maybe? Chris Bosh?
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
I’ll say have one player be a franchise player and that one player not count toward the salary cap. That would have parity across the league and do away with super teams.   So say you have Anthony Davis or Kawhi do they still demand trades when the Hornets and Spurs can give them a blank check more less when other teams can’t.   So really the only time a player would go on the move is when another team has a franchise player spot open.
He's kind of like if Anthony Davis had the mentality of a child-like Tim Duncan.
I remember that! It was a Pelicans-Warriors first round game and the foul would've been on Anthony Davis. I don't remember which year though.
Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis. I remember that campazzo block where AD was standing under the rim
"Giannis..? What the fuck are you talking about  This is about Booker carrying his team like harden a couple years ago where he has like half the teams points and everyone else shits the bed. Also harden had a LEGIT injury that kept him out a while before being thrown into the playoffs with a fucked up hamstring  We only THOUGHT Giannis had an injury because of how bad it looked, but he was fine and came back the next week, no injury or damage  Harden didn’t choke, he was hurt. It’s like saying “kyrie choked because he rolled his ankle” or “Anthony Davis choked because he got hurt”...  Also adpat haha"
"Lol. Ayton would be far less overrated if the Suns had faced a healthy Clippers team or a team with a legit pull-up threat (e.g. Lillard, Curry). People acting like he's Anthony Davis on defence have no idea what they're talking about."
"I'd put Paul George, Anthony Davis, Harden/Kyrie over him."
Ayton could really be the second coming of Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis?
she forgot who anthony davis is too
"He's the kind of transcendent player that needs a stage, and I think Anthony Davis proved no matter how great you are New Orleans just might not offer that opportunity."
Really putting Anthony Davis and Harden above Dirk. Tf r u smoking
"Anthony Davis is definitely worse than dirk so far, one title as a sidekick and one third place in mvp isn’t even in the same ballpark as dirk. I think he’s on a similar level to kawhi as well."
"LeBron, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Chris Paul, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  I don't think Dirk was even a top 10 player of the century. Some people might argue that Dirk was better than Wade and CP3, which is ok, but even if you have him over these two, there are still 10 other guys on that list."
"7 foot shooters hit differently, especially when they're young and can shoot coming into the league. We've seen raw 7 footers who's main attribute is being big and marginally coordinated come into the NBA, bulk up and become decent defenderd and rebounders. I think people get excited about 7 foot shooters because they start to project ""if they can just bulk up/stay healthy/dedicate an offseason to post defense, they'll be a huge asset."" Everyone's looking for the next Dirk. In today's NBA where teams put such a high value on spacing and spam pick and roll, having someone that can defend the 4/5, space the floor on offense, and are legit pick and pop threats, stretch 4s are arguably even more valuable.   A lot of that is theoretical though. Dirk is a unicorn, and even guys like Anthony Davis, KG, Bosh, Kevin Love etc. aren't/weren't shooting 3 pointers at rates that many envision from the mythical star stretch 4. You might be right that we're seeing a marker correction for some of these guys that were overvalued based on potential and projected development."
"Draft picks, especially potentially high ones, are a real wildcard.  Tonnes of instances of teams making win-now trades where picks (or drafted players who were yet to play an NBA games) go the other way, and the picks become by far the best piece in the deal. Legendary examples that spring to mind:  - Kobe (13th overall) for Divac  - Dirk (9th overall) for Tractor Traylor  I tend to agree with you when someone is trading for a clearly elite player - Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, etc.  If you can deal for a player like that, you do it, pretty much regardless of the price.  But Simmons, while good, is also pretty flawed - this is more of a Boogie to the Pels type deal.  Just Hield and Bagley for Simmons would be a steal for the Kings, but throw in three 1sts and I think it’s a steal for the 76ers.  I’d say Hield, Bagley, an (unprotected) 1st and a 2nd is roughly even."
"Embiid would be good with him, or Anthony Davis. A interesting fit would be Zion, but I think Luka would be my favorite to see , on the Mavs. Mavs really suffer by not having another creator and ball handler. Dame wouldnt have to carry the offense and ball handling and neither would Luka, and Dame could do off ball movement like curry."
"Giannis over ANthony Davis! Both aren’t centers but either way, Giannis is way more accomplished"
Okay James Harden was traded for less…    All we have to do is wait for some superstar to be unhappy and offer a package around Ben Simmons.    Maybe Lillard becomes unhappy with his situation   Maybe Beal becomes unhappy with his situation.    Y’all really out here like we haven’t had an unhappy star traded each time the last three years.   1. James Harden 2021 2. Anthony Davis 2020 3. Kawhi 2019    Really seems like y’all have no memory of anything past 3 months
"the same def raptor rating that says alex caruso is a better defender than anthony davis? kk  you mean 0.6 DBPM which is a good mark, anything positive is good  amusingly sabonis has a +0.4 defensive raptor so if you're trying to say he's a bad defender and 2 comments later justifying it with their RAPTOR rating then you've contradicted yourself"
"HE SAID IT HIMSELF  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/6/15/22533517/rich-paul-explained-anthony-davis-trade-demand-lakers-right-team-new-yorker-story  &gt;Paul said. I asked him about his early conversations with Davis about leaving New Orleans. He grew circumspect. “I educated him on why I thought the team wouldn’t be . . . ” He paused. “All athletes are competitive and confident, until reality sets in. And I educated him on things.”"
"He’s not close to top 5 bruh. Pascal Siakam is a great two-way player but he’s not top 5 either. Just being a good two-way player doesn’t vault you over the Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis etc. you’re delusional."
They also met amine and anthony davis at this same premiere
Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Jerami Grant
Wally Szczerbiak  Troy Murphy  Dale Ellis   Anthony Mason  Jeff Hornachek  Brent Barry  Hubert Davis  Rodney Rogers  Danny Ferry  Chuck Person  Drazen Petrovic
"Jokic, Anthony Davis, maybe Embiid, probably Westbrook on accolades and counting stats, CP3 is past his prime but was a generational talent and top 10 PG no question, similarly Howard, Melo, and Rose were all arguably generational talents at their peaks, Gobert deserves credit as probably the greatest defender of this generation, idk, its a weird thing to define"
"hey guys let's trade our stars for picks, and use those picks to trade for ~~Anthony Davis~~ ~~Giannis~~ ~~Russell Wilson~~ Damian Lillard!"
"Dame plays a more important position, is much better to have the ball in his hands, can create offense for himself and others much much more and more efficiently, has more career success as the best player on his team, has more individual accolades in the NBA, is universally accepted as a great organizational and team leader, and is a better player to build around.   Davis wins a title next to LeBron and the narrative changes, so whatever fits yours. I don’t dislike Davis. I don’t know Anthony Davis. I don’t blame him for leaving, tho he definitely didn’t handle it well."
"Damian Lillard is a 6x all NBA, Anthony Davis is 4x all NBA...."
Candace Parker looks like the female version of Anthony Davis.
"There is now way jimmy has a better case. Bam played 4 games also the lakers were not even close to a deep team. They were lebron and Anthony Davis + trash. If you take lebron and Davis away and remove bam and jimmy. Heat win that series. If you remove lebron, steph and klay from the 2015 finals, warriors stomp them by 30 a game. Enough with this nonsense. Lebron averaged 36-13-9 vs Jimmy’s 26-8-10."
"Based on skill alone, I’d be taking Anthony Davis all day, any day. But, knowing AD’s injury history…I’d probably take Dame."
Lmao Lakers fans really came at you hard with the downvotes. Anthony Davis has absolutely been a very injury prone player. He is always getting banged up and missing a quarter of the season. It’s part of the risk of having him at this point.
2019 Anthony Davis. 2011 Wade is close
"I don't think people seriously considered him a generational prospect more than any other consensus #1 pick. Andrew Wiggins might've had more. In recent memory, after Anthony Davis, I think only Zion was considered a a sure thing. Even Luka went 3rd."
"Oh sorry that the Bucks lost Donte DiVincenzo, he totally compares to losing James Harden and Kyrie Irving. Look I'm not discrediting the Suns and Bucks, they beat who was in front of them but their injuries just don't even compare to them not having to face a healthy Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard. Those are all arguably top 10 players in the NBA with Lebron, Durant, Harden, Davis, and Leonard usually in people's top 5. They got breaks and the chances of it happening again are slim to none so i don't expect either team back next year."
Is that Anthony Davis in the background?
Yeah. I agree. And NBA GMs have a kind of perverse incentive structure where doing the unexpected thing (even if it leads to improvement) is often judged more harshly than doing the expected thing (even if it doesn’t lead to improvement) and you wind up with teams that need a massive roster overhaul sitting pat at #1 and taking the consensus top guy instead of trading back for 2-3 solid pieces.  And that’s how you end up with Anthony Davis stuck on a pelicans team that only makes the playoffs 2 times in 7 years.
"This is the problem with r/nba that people say dumb shit and don’t get checked for it. We HAD bad player development because of Luke Walton’s staff. Now we have had for the last two years the best development coach in all of basketball in Phil Handy. Look at the Kings under Walton and you see their young talent hasn’t quite reached potential, and then look at how literally every NBA player works with Phil Handy. He has been an assistant coach on Nick Nurse’s staff, Tyronn Lue’s staff, and Frank Vogel’s staff. He has and still works with guys like Kawhi, Lebron, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving, Pascal Siakam, Anthony Davis, Rajon Rondo, Spencer Dinwiddie, and countless others that all have sung praises about him. There’s a reason why Steve Nash wanted him on his staff this past offseason and the Wizards were interviewing him for the job this offseason."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
Best was that one game where his hair started fraying and coming off and Anthony Davis was laughing and had to tell him about it.
I don't believe team USA is soft I just think all of the good big men outside of Anthony davis are foreign and having Kevin Love take up a roster spot is a waste.
In a perfect world we would have our best players representing team USA.  C Anthony Davis  F LeBron James  F Kevin Durant  G Klay Thompson  G Steph Curry    Perfectly balanced lineup that would be unstoppable.
In that Lakers playoff run Anthony Davis spent most of his time at center. You’re talking about wearing down when this is a short tournament not even close to an 82 game regular season?
"Anthony fucking Davis is injury prone and not a team leader. It's about more than stats. Trading the heart and soul of our team for someone who doesn't have the ability to lead our rag-tag group past what our expectations are (which Dame does constantly) is a bad move. AD is a great player, and there's no doubt about that, but he's not our missing piece and there's no way we'd trade Dame (especially since he'd then be competing against us in the West) for him."
Lmao I don’t want to ever trade AD but acting like Anthony fucking Davis is a bad return for dame is insanity. You will not get any player better than him for dame and even with draft picks it’s highly unlikely you get anyone close to his ability just saying.
Sometimes it's fun to remind myself that john Henson has like the exact proportions of Anthony Davis
"LeBron’s breakdown is: Ray Allen 185, Chris Bosh 356, Anthony Davis 113, Dwight Howard 83, Shaq 64, Wade 371, and Ben Wallace 104. Kyrie would add 235, Love would add 315. So he’s at 1826 if you include those guys."
"Less the team, more he’s excelling too late. People got sick of seeing him lose in the playoffs after being MVP on the winningest regular season team.   NBA discourse (even here among the masses of nephews) is so lacking in nuance and stupid that if you don’t win a ring, you’re trash. If you win a ring, you’re a GOAT.   See: Davis, Anthony.  What’s the difference between his game in NO and his game in LA that turned him from a high potential maybe to Top-10 all time that people act like all of a sudden.   It’s not that he’s in LA (though that definitely doesn’t hurt when it comes to fan perception.)  Giannis is the “fraud mvp that can’t win when it matters so who cares”.   See also: the discourse around Jokic this year despite it being clear as day who the mvp was."
how did you even decide to include for players who arent in yet? why include anthony davis but exclude kawhi?
"Devin Booker hasn't yet scored 34 points in any game in this series, let alone done it twice. If anyone is dominating this series so far it's Giannis. The Suns have no answer for him just like they had no answer for AD. Anthony Davis absolutely dominated the Suns in Games 2 and 3 and there's no reason to think he wouldn't have continued to do so if he hadn't tweaked his knee in the second half of Game 3 (which then led to his pulled groin in Game 4)."
anthony davis is kinda old and already very injury prone so i wouldnt have him on this list. embiid also not due to injuries. and devin booker at number 7 when for example donovan mitchell isnt even on the list is wild too

You gotta read sometimes. I said the SUNS can’t stop him. The same suns who dodged Anthony Davis and Kawhi. He been getting bounced by good defense teams his whole career but these suns have no answer. He still trash skill wise.
&gt; He's not the guy out there hitting a fadeaway 3 at the buzzer  There's one Anthony Davis who does basically everything Giannis does (and many of those things better) while also being a shooter who can make that buzzer beater. Very few people are out here calling him the best player in the world.
"If I’m considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De’Aaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D’Angelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I’m not forgetting anyone"
It is possible to defend guys driving at the rim without fouling  Anthony Davis and Draymond Green have lots of tape if Ayton and Monty want to check it out
He don’t play for em anymore but Anthony Davis’ unibrow definitely resembled a pelican
No he is not close to Anthony Davis  next nephew question please
"There was a thought that the perfect big man to pair with Harrell was Anthony Davis - covering up his defensive deficiencies, providing size and possibility of outside shooting... and go faster ie That you could get the benefits of both Trez and AD to a certain extent.  That really wasn't given a fair test out - since AD was either hurt or unavailable.  That said, I wasn't a fan of the Trez signing too much as he seemed to be part of the clippers dysfunction, Lakers already had lot of undersized big men who could play PF. (AD, LBJ, Kief, Kuz), he didn't help with lakers need at center with AD around (absorbing minutes and fouls against the bigger beasts), and he was weak on defense (the Lakers identity)  All the chatter was about how the Lakers got a  name scorer at a huge discount. The value of the contract, in other words, not the value of the fit."
There's nothing stopping him from forcing his way out à la Anthony Davis
"I think Luka was a way bigger prospect than Fultz/Towns/Irving.  He just didn't get projected first because everyone knew NBA teams weren't gonna take him first.  But Luka was a better player than anyone on this list.  I'd say the ranking goes:  1. Anthony Davis  2. Luka  3. Zion  4. Karl-Anthony Towns  5. Kyrie Irving  Fultz was similar tier to Kyrie tbh, as was Ben Simmons.  Embiid would have been fourth on this list if it weren't for injury concerns."
"&gt; The best equivalent on defense is an elite big under/near the basket in zone defense; this allows the rest of the team to play more aggressive around the perimeter, adding extra value. The NBA had illegal defense rules banning just that sort of strategy over Russell's entire career  You don't need to play zone defense to be effective defensively if the player you're guarding is most dangerous near the rim. Its not like help defense was illegal back then, and the lack of spacing meant there was far less ground to cover when making rotations, making Russell's job much easier back then than it would be now. Even in the limited Russell film available on YouTube, the spacing effect is apparent.   &gt; NBA rule changes since then have made it a little easier for a highly-athletic big to have an outsized impact on defense, but not by much.  Are you saying its *easier* to have defensive impact as a big in the modern age than it was in the 60's? I've never heard anyone make this argument, and I don't see how it could be true. If the spacing argument isn't convincing to you, consider the outrageous block numbers reported in some Chamberlain and Russell games. They were regularly near double digits, which doesn't even take into account all the shots they affected solely with their positioning. Even if the actual number of shots they blocked wasn't that high (but with the high pace of the time, its not that incredible of a claim), on a basic mathematical level, turning 10+ shots from high quality to low quality is enormous impact.   &gt; Even aside from all that... the difference on offense is so great that it doesn't take a deep dive to prove that Wilt was better than Russell  The difference in their box scores was enormous, but you can't just look at the box score to determine impact. I'm repeating myself, but if Wilt had all-time level offensive impact, you would regularly be able to see evidence of it in his team's offensive results, but you can't. When he was dominating the league with his scoring, it led to below average offenses. You can't say the same about Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Oscar, West, Jordan, LeBron, Kobe or pretty much any of the greatest offensive players in history, *even when they didn't have All-Star teammates like Wilt did*. I don't know what conclusion to draw from that other than the fact that Wilt's offensive impact during the years when he put up his most impressive box score numbers is overstated, especially compared to the greatest offensive players of all time.  &gt; They played the same position and had pretty similar physiques; you can apply today's advanced metrics (that haven't or can't be run back to their era) to any two recent players with pretty similar physiques and never find an enormous defensive impact difference.  That's just false and a hugely reductive way to look at defense. KAT is 7' with a 7'4"" wingspan and 248 lbs. Anthony Davis is 6'10"" with a 7'4"" wingspan and 253 lbs. Their numbers do not look the same. There are plenty more examples. I don't think it needs to be explained that defensive impact is much more nuanced than just looking at a players physique.  To be clear, my belief is that Wilt was clearly a more impactful offensive player than Russell, but I don't see any evidence that his offensive impact was at the level of an all time great. I do believe that Wilt was a great defensive player, but no one at the time, or since, was arguing that he was a greater defender than Russell, which combined with the fact that Russell turned a lackluster team into the most dominant defensive dynasty of all time, even as his teammates changed, makes Russell's case over Wilt very convincing."
"None of what you said means she is bad at her job lol. That is the shit that ESPN likes and promotes, if anything it shows how she has adapted to the model ESPN is looking for. No one here likes it, but the hot take and controversy creating bullshit is what apparently ESPN is after.  Now forgetting who Anthony Davis is..."
"Welcome to media, creating controversy = ratings. Maria Taylor forgot who tf Anthony Davis was.....  Did anybody actually know Taylor’s name before any of this? At least rachel is provocative and creates ratings."
"I know, it's a lot harder to identify and develop talent through the draft then it is to make bad decisions for five years and then fall ass backwards into LeBron James and Anthony Davis."
Yes bench Anthony Davis. Fantastic plan.
"I just saw a Clippers defense get picked apart by Mitchell and Luka. Yet Lebron James and Anthony Davis together won’t be able to? Also wake me up when PG plays like that with Kawhi on the floor at the same time, I’ll have to see it to believe it."
This team would get obliterated by the 2012 team. Anthony Davis was their worst player and he was the #1 pick
"I’m nominating the 2017 All-NBA team. 4 of the 5 had legit MVP cases that year (Russ, Harden, Kawhi, Lebron) and the other guy is Anthony Davis. 2nd team is a strong follow up too with Giannis, KD, Curry, Gobert, and peak Isiah Thomas. I haven’t gone through all the All-NBA teams but this is the greatest one I can think of off the top of my head."
Just look at the anthony davis ask me anything thread and you'll get a good idea
"Sorry, I should have specified “drove with intent to score.  &gt; In the Lakers’ first round series loss, the Suns played LeBron to drive, knowing that he lacked the explosiveness to finish upon arrival at the rim. Shockingly, after scoring 0.84 points per possession on isolations in the regular season (36th in the NBA among qualified players with at least two per game), LeBron scored just 0.5 points per isolation in the playoffs, the worst mark in the league.  &gt;Further, despite averaging 14.8 drives per game in the playoffs — almost 150% of his healthy regular season average — LeBron made just 48.6% of his shots on drives, more than 13 percentage points worse than his healthy average.   &gt;In each of those first three games, LeBron’s usage never climbed above 30% as he effectively attacked in bursts within the rest of the offense. However, the Lakers seemed to unravel as soon as they lost Anthony Davis in the second half of Game 4, letting their lead slip away to even the series before getting blasted in Games 5 and 6 by a combined margin of 43 points. As LeBron’s usage climbed near Westbrookian levels in parts of the final three games (all over a 30% usage rate), his efficiency plummeted, unable to shoulder the entire offensive burden by himself.  &gt;Without the gravity of another superstar on the floor, or the burst to explode through multiple defenders, LeBron simply couldn’t carry the downright anemic Lakers offense on his own. You can see his heavy feet as he turns the corner loosely on drives, and an extremely atypical lack of oomph to power through contact for finishes at the rim on his Game 5 misses in the paint  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2021/6/24/22541574/lebron-james-ankle-injury-lakers-nba-playoffs-analytics-stats-analysis"

"Don't stop there.  The Suns beat a Lakers team missing Anthony Davis, a Nuggets team missing Jamal Murray and a Clippers team missing Kawhi Leonard.  Flip *any* of those injuries and the Suns would have been the underdog."
"Hmm, maybe Kyrie Irving, Wade, or Anthony Davis?"
"He also purposely runs into guys every game and flails around which can be dangerous. He’s injured Anthony Davis with that stupid dribble into your path move and he’s injured his own shoulder flopping. Dirty is a tough designation, but Paul has done plenty and he just keeps doing it."
Anthony Davis
"So the nets did not have a players that was better than an injured James Harden? You can’t use the excuse “he was injured” when he played all those minutes. If he was that injured he should have played limited mins. Otherwise, the nets are just stupid and deserve to lose for playing an injured player or not having anyone on their bench that’s better than an injured player. You’d be saying the exact same thing if Anthony Davis played 50 mins and the lakers lost and lakers fans said it was because he was injured"
"LeBron, KD, Curry, Dwight, Carmelo Anthony, CP3, Kawhi Leonard, Westbrook, Giannis, Harden, Anthony Davis, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, Dame Lillard, Luka Doncic, Nicola Jokic, Rudy Gobert.  Guys like Ben Wallace and potentially Vince Carter have recently lowered the floor quite a bit."
"I mean, even this post-season .... Paul made the Finals, but no Anthony Davis, no Jamal Murray, no Kawhi....    The path was pretty easy for Paul and the Suns, compared to other seasons."
"KAT is the better player to build around right now, but really I think he's more an Anthony Davis type forward/center while Ayton is the traditional center mold. I wouldn't really compare the two in that regard."
"Big Market now a days just means ""the market where the media spews theories of superstars going to because they'd have the most ratings"" which ends up being LA teams and NY teams. Maaaaybe a side of Miami or Boston for NBA. It's why every time a superstar has a contract running out within 3 years you start seeing the media cycle of ""Superstar to Lakers/Knicks makes sense!"". Then when that superstar resigns with their team or goes somewhere else they just find the next one. It was Anthony Davis for a while, then the Greek Freak, now they started doing it towards Luka/Dame/Zion. It's media garbage but whatcha gonna do.     Otherwise ""big market"" would include big markets like Atlanta or Dallas but it never does."
My team! Carmelo Anthony. Anthony Davis. Paul Davis. Chris Paul. Paul George.!
Stupid anthony davis
"One of E'Twaun Moore, Jrue Holiday, and Solomon Hill will win a Championship after Anthony Davis"
"**Suns vs. Lakers:**  This is a tough series to predict if both teams are fully healthy. The Suns won convincingly in Game 1 when all players were relatively healthy. The Lakers won a close Game 2 and blew the Suns out in Game 3. The Suns were winning Game 3 even before AD went down. At this point it was looking like a 2-2 series even though Chris Paul got injured in the first half of Game 1.  Paul averaged 9ppg on 38% field goals in this series and was a detriment to the team throughout the series. Anthony Davis averaged 17ppg on 40% field goals. He was healthy in three full games in this series (Lakers went 2-1) while Paul was only healthy for one quarter.  This series was basically 2-2 with LeBron and AD at 90% or higher even though Paul was injured. There's no guarantee that the Lakers win if healthy. The Suns were a great team all season while the Lakers just didn't seem to have it this year. I think it could go either way, but they still had LeBron, which is nothing to scoff at.  **Suns vs. Nuggets:**  The Suns absolutely destroyed the Nuggets. Murray may have made it a 5-Game series, but anyone who thinks the Nuggets win this series is out of their mind.  **Suns vs. Clippers:**  The Clippers match up really well against the Suns and have all season. It was a close series, but I'm not sure Kawhi makes as big of a difference as people think. **The Clippers were 6-5 with Kawhi and 4-4 without Kawhi** in the playoffs this year. That's practically the same record. They almost lost to the Mavs in the first round with Kawhi playing, then beat the Jazz 2-0 without Kawhi after going 2-2 with Kawhi.  Other players stepped up for the Clippers in Kawhi's absence and the Suns also had some injury issues: Paul played with a torn ligament in his shooting hand, which clearly affected him as he shot 32% from the field and 12% from three before Game 6. Booker also had the broken nose, Payne had a hurt ankle, and Cam Johnson missed the last game with food poisoning.   The Clippers had worse injuries than the Suns, but the Clippers didn't look any better with Kawhi through the playoffs than they did without Kawhi. There's no reason to suggest this series would be different."

"That's silly, your comment implies that literally ANYTHING can happen in the NBA, i.e a superstar of a contending team literally dying, but it wouldn't have an asterisk.  6 of the 15 All-NBA players have been injured in this postseason, four of them either missed significant time or were ruled out of the postseason entirely and in those six, Anthony Davis, Mike Conley and James Harden are not included.  All of the Top 8 teams have had one of their top 3 players miss significant time (assuming Trae and Giannis miss more games), the winning team will win because all their opponents got injured. There's a significant chance we get an NBA Finals between Phoenix and Milwaukee/Atlanta where the Eastern Conference champion won't have their BEST PLAYER on the floor.  One injury here and there happens, but every single team that made the second round? 40% of the All-NBA teams? Stop it."
"&gt; Ad was a net negative game 4. Played terrible before he went down.   That's because he tweaked his knee in Game 3 and was [a game time decision to play in Game 4.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2943313-lakers-anthony-davis-questionable-for-game-4-vs-suns-with-knee-injury.amp.html) He hurt his groin because he said he was compensating for that knee injury. So yeah, it was 2-1 Lakers before AD got hurt. Let's also not forget that KCP as well suffered a knee contusion in Game 3 and also didn't play in Game 4."
"Yea but AD is substantially better than both, i only brought them up to show you that you don’t have to be a shooter to be a small 5 not to say that they would have beaten the suns  It’s Anthony freaking Davis dude, i don’t know what else i can say"
People were talking about Anthony Davis being better than KD when he was with the Pelicans. I think that’s a little extreme but he was top 3 in MVP voting one year and was consistently 1st team All NBA. Dude was clearly top 10
"Ok now why are we discussing the role players now? I thought this was about AD and LeBron not being 100%? And how exactly do you know what they’re thinking? Didn’t LeBron take a photo with Booker after the game? Yeah I’m sure he was pouting then. Jesus Christ, yeah you definitely build a team around fucking LeBron James and Anthony Davis, it sucks they got injured but you absolutely take a chance with those 2. You didn’t break shit."
"The fuck? You’re comparing injuries to Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard all in one run to what the Lakers faced last year? Suns fans have gone off the deep end lmao.  The Lakers probably would’ve beat the full strength Heat anyways. The Suns probably would’ve lost to the Lakers and Clippers."
"Chuck calling Anthony Davis ""Street Clothes"" gets me good"
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
Anthony Davis Jamal Murray  kawhi Leonard and now either giannis or tray
No Anthony Davis No Jamal Murray No Kawhi Leonard and No Giannis or Trae Young Suns ring should come with a pair of crutches
Traded their players and didn’t do shit to help him until truly 2016-2017 and made the playoffs in 2017-2018 and did Better without cousins than with.    They made the playoffs twice with Anthony Davis being the reason for the first trip and the second trip by having some supporting cast. They definitely wasted his time.
You literally just described Anthony davis
"As much shit NOLA gets for squandering Anthony Davis' tenure there, they did have something really intriguing with Cousins and Rondo."
"He didn't want to play the 5 then, and he wouldn't want to play the 5 now. Same case as Anthony Davis, neither of them want to be banging down with full-sized 7-footers all game"
"Yep. Well, as long as you do it right, and not the brain dead way the Pelicans did when trying to build around Anthony Davis."
She’s the one that “forgot” to put Anthony Davis on any of the All NBA teams last year. Pretty sure that was her first year covering the NBA
we've seen that thsee guys can get approval from docs even when theyre not ready. llook at durant and anthony davis. Look at harden.
"Same with this season, and any lockout-shortened seasons (like 2012). It isn't saying that it's a lesser championship, but the season was an atypical one.  Hell, the Celtics/Pacers 2013 seasons get an asterisk, too, since they only played 81 games (they were supposed to play the day that the marathon bombing happened, and never made it up because it had no effect on seeding). That doesn't mean that those two teams had lesser seasons.  People get heated about asterisks because of the association with Barry Bonds, but they don't mean that your stat or win doesn't count, just that the circumstances were different. In 20 years no one is gonna care that Jamal Murray or Anthony Davis missed playoff games in 2021, but they're sure as hell gonna care that the 2020 season was suspended due to a pandemic and restarted months later in a bubble at Disneyworld."
"That would be awesome asf.  But remember KD? Remember Anthony Davis? Yeah more often times than not, he’ll be reinjured if he’s not close to 100%.  And trust me, Giannis won’t be close to 100% in a few days..."
Anthony Davis also comes to mind
Anthony Davis. Man is almost 7 feet tall but he wants to play like a point guard
"He hasn’t led them anywhere yet. They beat a bad Knicks team and the Sixers in a series that was 90 percent determined by what the Sixers didn’t do than what the Hawks did. Now they’re playing a Bucks team without the 2x MVP.   Trae Young has had a good playoffs. We’ll see what he does next year when the rules are different and presumably the Hawks don’t have a joke path to the finals.   Also, Anthony Davis is one of the best defenders in the NBA and Trae is arguably the worst defensive player in the entire league."
Anthony Day to Davis is all time great
Trae Young is not remotely in the league of Anthony Davis lmao what are you talking about
"Trae young is not better than Anthony Davis, AD is better than Dame"
Devin Booker is a better basketball player than Anthony Davis.
"IMO(maybe a little biased) he looks like a future perennial allstar, borderline future superstar. You don't trade these players unless there is some truely massive deal like the anthony davis trade"
‘Do LeBron and Anthony Davis scissor?’
"Anthony Davis has more talent. So does Paul George. But if I want a #1 option to run and build my team around, I'm taking Luka or Trae over PG or AD."
No they started this season two months after the bubble Finals. Two month break not that long it is what it is. Lebron wanted his championship last year so he got it in the bible and he paid the cost this year with an injury. Anthony Davis is just made of glass and CP3 was bound to get injured sooner or later. A good half of this seasons other injuries have been either from too much time on the clock each game over the course of this season and the bubble.
Yeah if you think Trae Young is better than Anthony Davis we just aren’t going to agree.
"Some owners aren't in it for championships. They're in it for the money. As long as they still make money from their team they don't care if they win or not.  Look at the Kings, Magic, Wolves, Pelicans to name a few. Timberwolves absolutely wasted KG's career, his wingman was who, Wally Sczerbiak? Pelicans have had Chris Paul, Anthony Davis and now Zion and they might have like 1 second round appearance. Now the Magic, I think the Devos' might be content being Lakers farm team.   Some owners just don't care. They're not in it for the glory or whatever you want to call it. As long as the NBA is doing good enough they can just keep making money through revenue sharing regardless of how much a joke their team is"
Anthony Davis is not part of the top 10 today
Davis?? Like Anthony Davis is the 7th best PF in NBA history?????  No Dumars but you have Manu??
"Chuck: “If I played in today’s NBA, I’d go to game in a rocket ship.”  He isn’t wrong there. Schroder played horribly and he doesn’t command that type of money on a team where Anthony Day-to-Davis and an aging LeBron are carrying scrubs to the playoffs as a 7th seed."
Anthony Davis was a big reason we won. He literally played out of his mind and was our best player for the first 3 series.
He didn't dominate the west lol. We we've lost in the first round and didn't make the playoffs 2/3 years. Anthony Davis was our best player for the first 3 series in the west last year too.
"Ask John Collins, Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving？"
"Not nearly as important as missing your best player, Pat Bev wouldn’t of stopped Steph at all, Conley or Jrue either. Maybe the teams lose by a little less maybe. Those players had an impact but not nearly the impact as someone like Kawhi or Anthony Davis."
Sometimes they are Anthony Davis. Sometimes they are Royce O'Neale.
"That’s one, I saw fucking pat bev on that list. Any of players I named if blind are better players then Pat Bev. Like what really saying Jrue, Conley and Beverley is anything similar to Anthony Davis, Lebron, Harden, and Trae is hilarious."
Anthony Davis  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kawhi Leonard  Donovan Mitchell  Joel Embiid  Mike Conley  Jaylen Brown  Chris Paul  ---  No Trae or Jamal Murray
Anthony Davis. Jamal Murray. Kawhi. Giannis. Insanity.
"I wanna make sure Anthony Davis has talent around him after LeBron is gone. They better not commit to this, it would cripple us."
A crippled Kawhi could be beneficial to the Suns though. Sort of like when the suns were pummeling the Lakers when Anthony Davis was hobbling up and down the court
"I don't mind superteams. I find it's interesting in its own way to see if players can create chemistry while having a target on their back from every other team in the league. I like seeing which players take which roles. The career arc of Anthony Davis right now is very interesting to me for example.  I like the story of a team building talent around a star and winning organically, but I like the story about the Heatles figuring it out while being the most hated team in the league too. If we had 0 super teams I would miss the old ones, although to be clear I'd be happy to see the parity too. I like when the landscape of the NBA changes. I don't want it to be the same from decade to decade.  Edit: two for one on unpopular opinions today. 2nd one is that it's fun to not root for a particular team. Mma and boxing fandom got me used to rooting for individuals, and coming back to basketball I find there are individuals I like on every team. Games are fun to watch because I care down to the role players on both teams in some cases, and way less stressful."
"We need a series where all the injured players against the Bucks played all the injured players against the Suns.  Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Ibaka, Murray, and Zubac (Bench is KCP and Barton)  vs.  Trae Young, Irving, Harden, Dinwiddle, and Hunter (Bench is Bogdan, Reddish, and Oladipo)"
Anthony Davis isn't even a top 10 Player
So you think that Lebron being healthy and ad being healthy would have no impact on the series? Despite the fact a semi healthy Lebron and semi healthy ad were up 2-1 and the series went to 6 anyway even with no Anthony Davis at all and injured lbj? Why?
"I feel like player mobility has gone too far. Maybe it's a perception vs. reality thing for me, and the problem isn't as bad as I think. But I feel like there's a lot of like NBA team offers large contract to player for like 5 years, player accepts without intent of staying the length of the contract, and then they demand out because they ""want to go somewhere they can win"".   I think what really tipped me in this direction was the way James Harden forced his way out of Houston. The team had catered to him, and by reports, he got away with a lot of behavior that doesn't lend itself to winning a championship seriously (constantly late, not taking care or his body, etc.). Then when they seemingly hit the wall he pouts his way out, and gives a figurative finger to the fans that defended him on the way out. Not even a Houston fan, but as an outsider that's how I look at it. Same thing with Paul George (in OKC, ""I'm staying!... actually just kidding"") and Anthony Davis.  I know that in real industry we have the freedom to go job hopping, but the NBA (and professional sports generally) is not a normal business. It firstly depends on competition; and having players *seemingly (this is definitely the perception I get as an observer) cut and run when things seem like they are stuck is not great. But from the time we are kids we're told that the team is greater than the individual, the name on the front of the jersey is more important than the back, etc. I know it's a job, but to me, that's what I like about sports. The selflessness it takes to win and succeed as a team. I just feel like the NBA is really losing that with all the ""oh this team can't win, I'm out/blow it up and tank""."
"The Spurs didn’t tank for Tim Duncan. They lost one of the best players in NBA history to a season-ending injury, had a shitty year, and got lucky.   The Lakers signed Lebron James and Anthony Davis wanted to play with him. Neither of those teams were on the Sam Hinkie blueprint."
&gt; Mobley is not nearly good enough offensively to be in that category.  Sure he is.  He's absolutely terrific on offense and Anthony Davis showed absolutely nothing better than him in college.
&gt; All those players are unicorns.  How is Mobley not a unicorn but Anthony Davis is?
"I agree with some of this and disagree with the rest.  Agree that elite wings are the best way to put yourself in a position to win. They can guard more positions and are more versatile on offense in most cases (usually can shoot well and also post up/get to the rim with contact)  Disgaree that there's a limit to how well non-wings can perform. Even using your examples, you could argue some of those should/would have been a guard or center winning finals MVP had things gone differently. Had the Heat beaten the Mavs, there's a legit argument Wade outplayed LeBron; many people think Iggy got a ""thanks for limiting LeBron to a near 30 point triple double"" award over Curry (who also likely would have gotten it in 2016, which was a toss up even just among the Cavs with Kyrie); last season Jokic got stopped by Anthony Davis. Had the Nuggets made the finals he likely gets Finals MVP over Murray.  Even looking at how things are shaping up now, two of the four remaining teams would have a guard winning Finals MVP should they make it there. It's definitely tougher as a guard/center to see success in the playoffs, but not impossible imo"
"People keep saying things like that, yet Giannis just won back-to-back MVP's and is quite likely headed to the Finals.  Jokic just won an MVP.  Embiid is arguably the most dominant player in the game when healthy.  And Anthony Davis just won the Lakers a title last year.  A dominant big is still worth their weight in gold in this league."
"Mobley is Anthony Davis.  Allen is solid but he's not that, and he's about to get overpaid."
"He was drafted and loved the same Lakers scouting department that drafted gems like Kuzma, Thomas Bryant, Zubac, Josh Hart, Julius Randle, and Larry Nance later in the draft. Or the fact that Frank Vogel who is one of the smartest coaches in league love him. Or he’s being developed by Phil Handy the best development coach in the league that has specifically worked with Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, Kobe, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis. Or the fact that he rates in the 96th percentile according the Basketball Index in his getting to the rim rating. Or the fact he’s getting personally mentored by Lebron. There’s definitely a chance for the kid to succeed but have fun with your day."
He more brittle than anthony davis lmao
"Lowry currently has an ~85% chance of making the HoF according to bball-ref. Which would give him the 11th highest chance of active players.  Lebron, KD, Chris Paul, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis and Carmelo are basically locks. (All higher than 98%)  Then Dame is next at 90%  Then Lowry. And he will still add to his legacy and stats, so I'm assuming it's going to be a lock.  (Paul George, Kyrie, and Kawhi are the next 3, all above 77%)"
Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. Goodbye
"That was one take that Charles Barkley had on Anthony Davis that I kind of respected. He was saying that yeah every player gets banged up and has some chronic stuff, but it shouldn't happen until much later in your career (for Davis it's basically been a constant in his career). Definitely worrying since that stuff is only gonna get worse over time."
Wut?  Who in the world is going to max a guy who can't shoot and hasn't displayed anything more than an ability to successfully be a role player next to Lebron and Anthony Davis?
PatBev quoting the great HS locker room Anthony Davis.
That's exactly what Anthony Davis said.
You spelled Anthony Davis wrong.
"Fucking hell, ZUABC PLAYED WHILE HE'S INJURED IN GAME 4.  Blake Griffin played while he's injured in the 2019 Playoffs.  Anthony fucking Davis played while being injured in the first round.  You dumb as shit. You could absofuckinglutely play while you're injured.  Edit: Even Joel Embiid played while he's injured against the Hawks."
"But that's the thing though. If Luka asks for a trade, and the Mavs say they won't, there's no reason why Luka wouldn't just go all-in, sour the relationship, and refuse to play.  Players have all the power now. You could say that Luka doesn't want to give up any ""golden boy"" reputation he has with the fans, but in truth, that doesn't matter. Look at how Anthony Davis and James Harden have managed to dodge hate for forcing their way out of their teams while on contract. Only hardcore, constantly-following-the-news types of fans still hold that stuff against them, and even then they're called haters for it. Everyone else has moved on, or in the case of casual fans, never even paid attention to that stuff."
"&gt;AD got hurt in game 4  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004066-lakers-anthony-davis-hyperextended-knee-in-game-3-win-says-injury-feels-fine](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10004066-lakers-anthony-davis-hyperextended-knee-in-game-3-win-says-injury-feels-fine)  Kinetic chain. He had an ankle problem before this, then extended his knee in G3, then extended his groin in G4. Medical professionals will be able to illustrate this for you if it still doesn't make sense.  &gt;Lebron was very healthy when he was head at the rim catching oops off the glass and the bench was clowning Jae Crowder  This makes no sense. This narrative that LeBron was healthy because he made one nice play and did a celebration in front of his bench is pure conjecture, doesn't make logical sense and not based in reality.  Can you not make fun of people if you're not physically injured? Would LeBron not be able to laugh at Jae Crowder if his ankle was truly hurt?  &gt;Goalposts keep moving for you that's kinda sad bro  You're coping with the fact that less and less people are respecting this ring before you've even won it, lmaoooo."
"Also, with any injury there's always the risk that you can injure something else just due to overcompensating for the first injury. Anthony Davis said he injured his groin cause he was trying to play through a tweaked knee. If you're playing hurt there's *always* a risk of further injury."
"I think you're trolling, but your post is swiss cheese. Kareem hated the media so much he starred in Airplane and a Bruce Lee movie after getting traded, right. You for some reason admitted that both Wilt and Shaq wanted celebrity life but acted like you were explaining it away.  Payton, Malone and Nash's stats the year before signing with the Lakers:  20 points, 4 rebounds, 8 assists,20 points, 8 rebounds, 4.7 assists,12 points, 11 assists, All-Star.  Lebron you admitted, AD wanted to play in a big market.  Now, 7 of these guys were league MVP's. I won't count McAdoo because he was the only one who actually was washed, but Anthony Davis is also obviously MVP-level. Go check how many other teams have signed league MVP's at or near their prime or had a league MVP force their way there via trade. Getting one or more free stars every 8 years is VERY VERY OFTEN."
"I’ll answer it for you.  Never.  It’s pretty clearly a fluke when Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray all miss playoff games due to injury for the first time in their careers."
"or i mean, anthony davis, but i digress"
"Both of those injuries are valid, but you could also point to Anthony Davis, LBJ not being 100%, Murray, and Kawhi, and say those players are probably better on the court. Everyone you beat has been missing one of their two best players (or at least had then hobbled) for the majority of the series. Not to mention the Nets all died before they could even make the finals.  But I don't know why people get so offended when it is pointed out, all you can do is play who is in front of you and the Suns are doing what a good team should do: punish teams when they are weak. Asterisks aren't real, all championships count. The Suns took care of business, bad teams would've had longer series"
"&gt;I mean even LA. Lakers got LeBron and Shaq, which are monumental but that's it. We don't exactly get free agents nonstop.  The other players force their way there via trade. And yes, you get them non-stop. Wilt, Kareem, Bob McAdoo, Shaq, Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Steve Nash, Lebron, Anthony Davis etc etc. Not counting canceled trades or guys who didn't stay like Chris Paul, Dwight etc."
"&gt;Anthony Davis is not a “gym rat”  Well duh, he's not a white NBA player..."
"This year is a weird year.  Like I would have never said Booker, CP3, Paul George, or Trae Young had any shot at this but then AD, Kyrie, and Kawhi were all assassinated and here we are.  Assuming there's not another year like this anytime soon, I think it's probably a player that's already a perennial All-NBA person.  We're at a point where James Harden will never even be the best play on a title team.  I'm going to say maybe Dame Lillard or Jayson Tatum or Anthony Davis or Jokic or Giannis.  I mean, it's gotta be someone really good.  Here's the last 10 years:  2020: Lebron    2019: Kawhi    2018: KD    2017: KD    2016: Lebron    2015: Steph    2014: Kawhi or Duncan or Parker maybe?    2013: Lebron    2012: Lebron     2011: Dirk    &amp;#x200B;  That's an insane list.  You have to go back to 2004 to find someone that isn't one of the greatest basketball players of all time."
Anthony Davis catching strays don’t do my man like that
"No, that’s a libero.  You’re thinking of Anthony Davis."
Anthony Davis doesn’t want to play in Boston
Giannis plays PF and Center.  That's a big man.  By that logic Kevin Garnett and Anthony Davis aren't big men.  Kevin McHale isn't a big man.  People consider Tim Duncan a PF I guess because he's a forward he isn't a big man.  Giannis is a big man.
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"
"LeBron, Dwight, Marc Gasol, Carmelo and Russ were all in the 2012 All Star game, as was Luol Deng who is also still technically on their roster. Recent Laker Rajon Rondo was also in that game, as were buyout candidate Kevin Love and current Lakers target Andre Iguodala. AD made the 2014 game:  Westbrook, James, Anthony, Davis, Howard.   Rondo, Iguodala, Deng, Love, Gasol.   TL;DR: Finalise Melo and Iguodala, bring Rondo back, wait for a Love buyout and get the decrepit corpse of Luol Deng back on the court, boys. We're winding back the clock."

Anthony Davis is toxic /s. Oh how the tune changes lol
They just got nothing for one of the primary pieces of a trade for Anthony Davis.
Lakers starting lineup:  Bron Westbrick Davis  Carmello Anthony  Gasol   The 2014 dream team lol
"An Anthony Davis type player, apparently. If they only had the chance to get one..."
"He was never good. He was just fortunate to have peak Lebron, who re-signed there for reasons that had nothing to do with Griffin.  Then, he landed in NO, and everybody acted like he was a genius for getting a good haul for Anthony Davis."
"The Lakers had a chance to impress Caruso, but after the Lakers put Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Schroeder, Drummond, and Westbrook around him, Caruso decided their heart wasn't in it."
"How original with the flair attack.   You know you can evaluate a team's decision making independent of which team you root for?   The Lakers got LeBron James and Anthony Davis because of the power of the Laker brand, and have only once built a team with a roster construction that makes sense in now 3 years. That's pretty terrible considering just how easy it is to build a good roster around LeBron and AD."

Anthony Davis is pretty good I think
Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis
In 2024 Ball will be in the second to last year of his deal with the Bulls correct? Maybe Anthony Davis goes home in 2024.
"I wouldn't bet the farm on Anthony ""street clothes"" Davis."
"Disagree. Jrue stinks. He shot under 33% in 4 out of the 6 games in the finals. He's overrated, overpaid, and they won despite of him not because of him. The Bucks could've traded for Chris Paul or Russell Westbrook last offseason when nobody wanted them and be a lot better off. Jrue was Anthony Davis' #2 for years in New Orleans and they never did shit. The difference is Giannis is on currently on a GOAT path while AD is always more like a glorified DeMarcus Cousins. The only chance small market team has a chance to win the championship is fluke into a generalizational GOAT-caliber player like LeBron or Giannis who can single-handedly beat super teams and win a ring. In those cases, #2 and #3 guys don't even have to be perennial all-stars. Overpaying for the likes of Jrue and Lonzo never ends well. Even if they do win a ring, it's often in spite of them not because of them."
that boomer attitude is the same one your FO has and it's why pels couldn't win with anthony davis and now zion is going to be requesting a trade in 6 months
anthony davis 2.0
"Just because you can play him alongside Jarrett Allen, doesn't mean you should.  Just because Anthony Davis can play alongside Dwight Howard doesn't mean he should.  Just because Chris Bosh can play alongside Joel Anthony doesn't mean he should.  Just because Al Horford can play alongside Joel Embiid doesn't mean he should."
they thought we wouldn’t notice they recast kevin love with anthony davis
Anthony Davis seems to do alright defensively as a pf and he’s never played with a defensive center as good as Allen.
"Dude he’s 23 years old I didn’t know he was supposed to have a flawless playoff run he went toe to toe with Anthony Davis, Jokic, and did what Rudy Gobert couldn’t against the Clippers and you’re saying he’s not worthy of a max because he couldn’t guard Giannis when NOBODY in the league can guard him? You’re just nit picking looking for reasons to bash the kid"
"I consider injury-prone to mean someone who picks up small injuries that keep them out a few games at a time or force them to leave midway throughout the game.  in the last 3 seasons Curry has missed time for a groin injury, a hand fracture and a tailbone fracture. 3 major injuries.  AD has missed time for a Groin strain, knee strains, adductor strains, calf strains, achilles strains, quad strains etc etc. [Source](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)  Kawhi has missed time for Knee, Foot, Back, Leg, Rest and Load management. [Source](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/kawhi-leonard-player-injuries)  Clearly not the same, it's like saying Klay is more injury prone than Kawhi/AD because he's missed the last 2 season combined.   Why didn't you put KD on this list? he's only played 113 games in the last 3 seasons combined. the stats you chose to provide are cherrypicked, hope I've helped you understand how"
How many games have Anthony Davis left midway?
Westbrook and Harden lead the league every year in assists at the rim. The idea that Westbrook is not going to help Anthony Davis is fucking asinine. He's helped way worse big guys get easy baskets.     &gt;Westbrook is basically useless on offense without the ball. He sits at the three point line and his defender just leaves him. Watch the games  You mean like teams did to Rondo in the 2020 playoffs and the entire 2020 season? Lakers seemed to work around that just fine.   Might want to take your own advice and start watching the fucking games.
"As a Pelicans fan, I'd rather Anthony Davis punch me in the face then this nonsense go through."
"lol go eat a dick asshole. I never said it was realistic, I never said they should do it, it's just some fun puzzle solving I like to do in my free time. I have gotten several trades correct though. Teddy Bridgewater to DEN, Delon Wright, TT SAC ATL deal, Horford to BOS Kemba to OKC, Anthony Miller to HOU, CP3 WB swap in HOU, Brock Osweiler salary dump to CLE, HOU drafting Davis Mills, TEN drafting Brady Breeze @ 215 overall, etc.. It's a fun side activity that I like to do."
An I O U of Anthony Davis when LeBron retires? 🖤
Who isn’t? Anthony Davis is probably least likely if everyone retired tomorrow but he’ll make the HOF.
Huh lol. Anthony Davis is terrible from 3. He’s 31% for his career and has never even hit league average in a season.
"Letting Lonzo goes is what will make the team good.   Pelicans have a pretty great cap situation coming up before Zion’s extension kicks in.   There will inevitably be some star who gets disgruntled in the next couple years (Lavine, Jaylen, KAT, Ja, Doncic) and with a clean cap they could have the assets to get them   In addition to all their picks (Bucks, plus control of the Lakers ‘23-25 picks and the Lakers team is a bunch of post-prime stars and Anthony Davis who is always hurt.   They also have some young guys that can get full time Pt and see who fits best with BI/Zion. Kira, NAW, Hayes, Trey3, etc etc with Adams, Bledsoe, and hopefully Lonzo gone.  Signing Lonzo locks the Pelicans into Lonzo as their 3rd best player.  He’s….fine, but what is he a top 50-75 player at best?  Letting Lonzo walk and keeping cap flexibility gives the Pels a chance to add a #3 that’s a top 20 player.   And they control that future because it’s via trade"

"It is really funny seeing this post pop up right below the Davis/Westbrook post.   &gt;In 2017, Bleacher Report predicted that Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook would team up on the Lakers  Because I'm sure 2017 people would've posted 'delusional Laker fans' all over the comments on any posts regarding LeBron to the Lakers, or AD to the Lakers, or Westbrook to the Lakers."
"&gt; You can't put Olimpija and Dinamo Bucarest in the same tier lmao. They produced so many NBA players in the past, its not even funny.   You can't put Kentucky and Duke in the same tier lmao. They produced so many NBA players in the past, its not even funny. Kentucky players in the NBA: Wall, Cousins, Towns, Kantor, Rondo, Bledsoe, Anthony Davis.  developing prospects that enter the NBA as rookies is not the same as those players at their current level beating NBA teams."
"Both are athletic freaks, but Ant is a bit more of a power/explosive thicker body type and Green is leaner/lighter on his feet, looks more effortless like Zach LaVine.  IMO There's no reason KAT shouldn't get something like the Anthony Davis package. He's a top 3 center and really young who I think will look so much better on a winning team next to another superstar."
They have a bigger age gap than like Tatum and Anthony Davis

"Because the Lakers *need* a playmaker.   It's like you guys don't watch the Lakers.   The Lakers have been consistently awful when LeBron sits the last three seasons. Biggest weakness on each of the last three Laker teams.   The Lakers have no other shot creators on the roster besides LeBron. It's the main reason the team struggled so much this past year when he was out, even with Dennis back. One ball handler isn't enough.   Beyond that, the Russ move was also made for Anthony Davis. Russ and Harden are at the top of the league in assists at the rim the last few years. Russ will find Davis for easier baskets at the rim. He's done it with much worse players than Davis."
"Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis, LeBron James and Russel Westbrook. Holy shit. That is some ugly ass basketball.   I hope JJ Reddick starts at SG. 2012 all over again!"
"What was the last team to have five Hall of Famers on the roster? I can think of a few with four off the top of my head, but I’m having trouble coming up with five.  Also need to figure out what the record is for most All-Star selections heading into a season is, because Anthony, Davis, Howard, James, and Westbrook combine for 52."
Yes. We had Lebron and Anthony Davis waiting in the paint. That’s going to deter him from driving. Against most teams you just take that to the rack.
you're basically saying 90% of nba draft picks are busts then LOL     deandre aytons a bust relative to anthony davis     and anthony bennetts a bust relative to deandre ayton
"I'm not penciling the Lakers in for any parade. I think the team will be good. I'd be surprised if they weren't a top seed.  The Lakers were a half-game back behind the Jazz before they lost LeBron. That was without Anthony Davis. Other teams were injured, but the Lakers played the vast majority of the year without their two best players. It's the entire reason the team slid as far as it did.  I feel pretty confident that a healthy Lakers team would have been a high seed and likely would have avoided Phoenix in the first round in the first place."
Dude literally lists a former Anthony Davis teammate as proof that the Bucks team is better than any teammates AD has ever had.   Boy you just proved your lack of intelligence. Yall lakers fans are somethin else
"just modern era, Chicago 1st all time. Derrick Rose, Anthony Davis, Mark Aguirre, LaRue Martin."
"Conley subbed in for an injured Devin Booker, who himself was a previous sub in for an injured Anthony Davis. It's a fake all-star appearance."
LeGaymelo Anthony-Davis
"At some point though, you're gonna need higher level players if you want a better team  On a team where Anthony Davis should be playing like 40 minutes of C late in the playoffs, sure, I'll take the low cost option. On a team desperate for starter-level bigs, I'd spring for Allen"
"Rondo shot three 3s per game. He wasn't a volume shooter.   You're also missing the entire point of my post. Teams didn't guard Rondo at three no matter how many he hit. Russ will be guarded in a similar manner, except he's a much better player in general than Rondo is.  Like I said, this move was made to get Anthony Davis easy baskets at the rim and to help the Lakers in non-LeBron minutes. Russ can do that! He just had a pretty good year."
There is no stringing along Griffin. He made that very clear after the Pelicans won the lottery. Anthony Davis was either “all the way in or all the way out.”
The wild part is the Pelicans did this the entirety of the Anthony Davis run- leveraging future 1sts for “win now” players. Who could ever forget Omer Asik? They’ve always been doing this
Anthony Day-To-Davis  WebEmbiid  Raheem Most-Hurt
"&gt;The problem with signing Westbrook is you basically can’t have another non-shooter on the floor with him at the same time. That limits a lot  The Lakers did just fine playing lineups like that in the 2020 playoffs. Rondo's man sagged off every time. So did Caruso's. Westbrook is a better player than both of those guys.  They made up for it with vertical spacing and just being bigger and more talented than other teams.    Westbrook has more assists at the rim than any other player over the last several years. I don't know how that equates to ""not fitting."" This move was made to get players like Anthony Davis easier baskets at the rim and solve the problem of the Lakers not having another playmaker besides LeBron. The last three years the Lakers have consistently lost the minutes LeBron has sat. Westbrook helps that."
"??? so teams are gonna just leave Lebron, Anthony Davis, and Westbrook open? God I hope so. Please ignore all 3 of them all game and triple team Caruso 🥴"
Bucks didn’t beat any of the top contenders and probably don’t beat any other champion this decade. Lakers had one of the best of all time and Anthony Davis inside.   So yeah if you have lebron and AD you don’t need 3pt shooting. Most teams do. Lakers also the best defense
NBA is going to just give the Lakers an injured player exception in advance to for Anthony ‘Day to’ Davis.
Anthony Davis

Anthony Davis alone is better than '18 Cavs entire supporting cast together. This is a very stupid comparison.

Anthony day to Davis.
looking forward to the return of Anthony Day-to-Davis
"Yeah, but Nash never averaged 20 a season, and Dwight only did it 4 times. Not at all the same as 4 all stars who all averaged 20 ppg last season. In fact Anthony Davis had the lowest point average out of the 4. Anthony Davis, the guy who absolutely torched the 2020 playoffs with his mid range shooting."
"What have you seen out of him so far that makes you think he's going to improve? He has bad hands, bad court awareness, can't set screens, and tries to play like Kevin Durant despite being built like Anthony Davis."
"Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent nine and twelve seasons with OKC, respectively. Bradley Beal has spent his entire career with Washington and he still wants to play for that shithole team. Damian Lillard has played with Portland for a decade thus far. Anthony Davis spent seven seasons with the Pelicans before demanding out. This whole shit is overblown."
"In no particular order and assuming that they keep the original 50.

"Anthony Davis is fucking 27 years old dude, quit acting like he's old or has some kind of degenerative condition.   I'm not picking or choosing anything. All I said was last year was the first time he's ever missed a playoff game in his career. Is that true or is it not?   The three months of rest before the bubble is irrelevant to bring up. Those guys had to go home and then immediately ramp up to basketball shape with eight games. Some of them didn't even have gyms to play at.   Are you implying that AD would have gotten injured had the season not been suspended? He had played and started in every single game in 2019-20 before the suspension and wasn't nicked up at all.   In fact, if you look at his games played it's really not that bad at all. The only reason he even missed any games in 2018 is because the Pelicans didn't want to let him play. In 2019 he played in every game in the regular season. In both 2017 and 2016 he played in 75 games.   Last year is the only recent year where he's missed a significant amount of time with an injury. And it shouldn't have surprised anyone considering he got no test at all."
You think Anthony Davis is better than James Harden  You don't know basketball
"&gt;	But also, to be fair, fans have a really really massive impact on the outcome of games. Taunting, cheering, chanting, the energy in the room etc.  so something the lakers were also effected by? okay  &gt;	What was uninteresting about the bubble is that it was just match ups. Like yeah, a team with Anthony Davis and LeBron James are going to be a lot more successful in a pure 1-to-1 matchup. Duh.  lmao revisionist, we weren’t even favorites to win the title. People genuinely thought we were gonna lose to every team we faced besides the heat.  &gt;	The Lakers have one of the quietest.  this isn’t even true we hover around 9-10 on most “loudest fans lists” all two of them that i could find. Also lack of crowds effected everyteam so again don’t see how this means anything.   &gt;	Clearly never played a sport in front of people, or performed in front of people in your entire life if you think that doesn't make sense LMAO.  lmao i played varsity hs ball and am going to play for a d1 school starting soon, this doesn’t make sense because every team had no advantage. meaning an even playing field. now if the lakers got to play with a home crowd all playoffs then yeah sure that’s a bogus ring. but everyteam faced the same thing. y’all just mad cause the lakers were the team that won."

anthony davis will get hurt and miss most of the season. he’s a stick man.
"Yes. Fuck the Lakers.  But also, to be fair, fans have a really really massive impact on the outcome of games. Taunting, cheering, chanting, the energy in the room etc.  It makes a significant impact.  What was uninteresting about the bubble is that it was just match ups. Like yeah, a team with Anthony Davis and LeBron James are going to be a lot more successful in a pure 1-to-1 matchup. Duh.  The Utah jazz and the Portland trail Blazers have some of the loudest fans in the NBA. The Lakers have one of the quietest. Would that have kept the Blazers from being eliminated? Probably not, they sucked. Would it have with the jazz? Honestly, I'd say probably."
"Westbrook: ""I'm used to playin' with a bigtime player! A real killa! A bonafide stud! You all might remember, he was a pretty tall dude! Shot the lights out! Stud in the playoffs! You all know who I'm talkin' about. NICK COLLISON. And now ANTHONY DAVIS."""
"It's easier to image the salt when the Lakers get steamrolled in the first round when Anthony ""[40 different injuries in the last 5 seasons](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)"" Davis can't play and Westbrook averages 33% from the field again."
"In the regular season this is a bad thing.   In the playoffs, it shouldnt take Westbrook to real you Anthony Davis at center is your best lineup"
“Anthony Davis” “Play more”  Pick one.
Of course it can get worse lmao. You’re adding a dogshit shooter who literally does not need to be guarded from three to a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
"He fits ok on paper. He's a great passer for Anthony Davis, can make post passes, lobs, and wrap-around passes near the rim. He doesn't need lebron or AD to set up him. He can play mini-lebron and do the drive, get the defense to move, and throw it quickly to the opposite corner, which means the bench offense can keep the same game plan but with discount lebron running the show. He's high energy and a great rebounder.   His lack of shooting hurts . But if he can get his TS% back up to league average and go something like 15-10-10 while playing 3rd fiddle, that's going to really help, and you just try to find some shooting elsewhere."
You're on the sub that asked Anthony Davis if he and LeBron scissor each other
"Russell Westbrook yelled, “There you go!” Anthony Davis gave a look of pleasant surprise. Alex Caruso belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before LeBron James hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Magic Johnson hugged him &amp; said, “Where is everybody?”"
"Yea it's because you're delusional. Kevin Durant is currently the best player I'm the league and NO ONE, thinks Davis is better than Harden. Davis is an injury prone center who's won 5 playoff games as a first option. Harden carried literal bums to deep playoff runs year after year and nearly beat the best team of all time. Anthony Davis couldn't even make the playoffs every year with Jrue Holiday before he bailed out."
Can't wait for a lineup of James Cacok Gay Anthony Davis
He chose to go to the Lakers to play with LeBron James and Anthony Davis. I feel like that sentence in itself requires no further reflection on his motivations. I hate when reditus play sports psychologists.
"We need to find a man that can shoot the basketball.   And Anthony Davis 100% has to play center now. Which might bite us in the ass. But it has to happen. A tradition bigman on the floor, plus Bron, Westbrook and AD would make for some disgusting basketball."
Keep telling yourself Westbrook will be above LeBron James and Anthony fucking Davis on the Lakers pecking order
"Don't talk condescending to me, first of all.   Pelinka knows how to work the cap. The Lakers have guys that can be signed and traded, amongst other moves they can make. Schroeder can be traded for a player or TPE, from what I understand. As can THT.  Tough spot? We have LeBron and Anthony Davis. The hardest part is done. This team will be fine."
"Not gonna happen, but you can hope.   A team with a healthy LeBron and Anthony Davis is not a first round exit, especially with the way the West has weakened with Kawhi and Murray's injury and the Suns likely to regress. Dallas is still not a contender. I don't want to hear anyone talk up the Jazz again after their latest May embarrassment.   Who in the West is going to be clear-cut better? And we have to remember the Lakers aren't done. They have moves to make with Schroeder's contract and other guys to dangle to get solid role players."
Because the roster isn't done yet?  Wait for them to fill it out and for the team to play some games before you guys start your shitty analysis lol we all know your takes on the Anthony Davis trade aged like fucking milk for this precise reason.
"Yeah y’all are way too sensitive, not saying Anthony Davis isn’t good. His lack of shooting is a problem for the Lakers when the Lakers roster have no shooting."
"“Lebron just can’t be in tier 1. He’s a pantheon guy for sure, but Bird had to play with a broken back! Lebron can’t play with a bum ankle, c’mon. Hey, do you think the Celts could trade Grant Williams and some picks for Anthony Davis?”"
"Anthony Davis - who is statistically one of the worst volume jump shooters in the league - got red hot with his jumper in the Bubble. After shooting 33% from 3 in the regular season, he shot 38% from 3 in the Bubble, and 42% from 3 in the Finals.    He followed it up by shooting 26% from 3 this year. If Anthony Davis can shoot like he did in the Bubble, it fixes a ton of problems for that Lakers roster, but I have little confidence he will."
"Just report it. Have a database accessible to every team that logs reported conversions. It could be something simple like:  Affected players: Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook  Discussion: Talked about Westbrook requesting a trade to the Lakers.  It shouldn't be too difficult for a player to text the FO and have a staffer input it."
"1. Anthony Davis IS constantly injured  2. It's a good nickname that it very appropriate  3. Stay mad at people making jokes, that's a good way to live your life"
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards’ season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  “This is not a run-it-back team,” he said.  Now, it’s official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday’s NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won’t become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook’s outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose résumé includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he’s done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team’s culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal’s closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards’ preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what’s now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming — especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie’s incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn’t all. The Wizards’ Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards’ list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer’s free agency class is rich with capable point guards — from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte’ Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it’s confusing, but that’s not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They’re adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford — though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it’s difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
I was there and LeBron and Anthony Davis were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and the baby looked at me
They're closer than that [link](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5538612/russell-westbrook-pelicans-star-anthony-davis-share-friendship-off-the-court)
It’s been [reported](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22601457/anthony-davis-told-russell-westbrook-hed-play-center-more-make-trade-work-lebron-james-lakers) since news of the trade broke that Davis discussed having enthusiasm in playing center with Westbrook and James to allow them all to coexist.
Anthony Davis is not playing the 5 and lebron is not playing the 4 bro lol
Kyrie Irving / Ja Morant   Anthony Edwards  Brandon Ingram  Ben Simmons / Zion Williamson  Anthony Davis / Deandre Ayton    tbh seems like it's mostly big men and point guards ... not a lot of wings to choose from
"Idk when I said Devin Booker is a more valuable/better player than Anthony Davis alot of people seemed to be really upset.  ""Every GM would take AD"" okay congrats lol. I wouldn't."
Chris Paul and Anthony Davis are 2 for me. Paul has had a decent career of turning teams around but has never won and probably won't. Davis had an extremely forgettable career with the Pelicans then joined Lebron to get a chip. I often forget he's on the Lakers tbh
"How about getting creative with a team of Damian Lilliard (6’2),  Steph Curry (6’3), Zion (6’6), Paul George (6’8”), and Anthony Davis (6’10”)? Who's gonna beat that team?"
Anthony Davis
Kawhi or Anthony Davis
Are we conveniently forgetting that Anthony Davis went down in game 4 when he dicked them b2b with 34 points and it was looking over for the Suns? Please. If everyone was fully or even mostly healthy the Suns don’t make the Finals. The Clips took them to 6 without 2 starters - their best player out and also Ibaka gone and Zubac even missing a game.
"""I'm gonna be honest, I think I've earned a starting spot on this team""   - Nerlens Noel playing behind Anthony Davis"
That Anthony Davis wasn’t as good as Cousins. I just think AD is soft and plays most times like he wants to be 6’. Cousins atleast uses his sides and plays with heart.
Anthony Davis!
Thats not even debatable.  Live more dangerously and say tatum &gt; anthony davis.
It’s like saying Anthony Davis is just a random twitch streamer.
&gt; Anthony Davis is better than Lillard too
"Understand, anthony davis has the best eyebrow(singular)."
Anthony Davis fuming
Anthony Davis all day!
"Pelicans have less than 20 years of drafting, so not all that deep but pretty good:  Starters: Chris Paul, JR Smith, Zion, David West, Anthony Davis  Bench: Darren Collison, Buddy Hield, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Brandon Bass"
Do yourselves a favor and watch the Wilt one…..holysmokes!  He’s like a combo of Anthony Davis and Hakeem
"as another kentucky fan, his ability to run on the perimeter was unbelievable for a guy his size. the way he murked Jerian Grant on that last possession is all you need to know   he wasn’t Anthony Davis, but WCS was nothing but really good in college"
Anthony Davis playoff run in the bubble was legendary and got trivialized mere months after
"Are people really being honest with their answers?  Saying names like Michael Carter Williams/Tyreke Evans/Jabari Parker and whatever is at the top of the page when you Sort By Best?  Like who do people consider as top 5 players right now?  Players like Giannis?  Anthony Davis?  Kawhi Leonard?   The names that people are listing, do people really think were going to reach that level?   Top 5 is Finals MVP level.  You look at a guy like Jimmy Butler, who was the best player in a NBA Finals team, I doubt majority of the people consider him top 5 level.  Or even the Suns teams this past Finals.  Do people consider anybody in Suns a top 5 player?  Top 5 is a ridiculous high level to reach."
"Just because Harden can score doesn’t mean he is a great teammate   Playing with LeBron is not the same as playing with Harden   In his first season with Wade he went to the Finals, winning one the next year.   In his first season with Kyrie/Love he went to the finals; then won one the next year   In his first season with Anthony Davis he went to the Finals and won a championship.   LeBron has a proven track record of elevating other players’ games. As evidenced by the crazy contracts people like Mozgov and JR Smith got for example   What has Harden done to make his teammates better?  He flamed out in his one finals appearance.   Since then he has choked in every big playoff game he has played in.   Couldn’t get it done with Chris Paul or with Westbrook but Russ is the problem right?  Lol keep this same energy next season"
Anthony Davis has objectively been the way better playoff player.
"Here's mine:  MVP: Curry  Nets and Lakers are top teams, but since they're Superteams they won't get much MVP considerations because LeBron is gonna do a LOT more coasting and load managing in the regular season. Bucks might take it easy this season and not worry about going for the 1st seed. Nobody likes the sixers anymore, and Curry is primed for another MVP Caliber season with Klay working his way back and other roster improvements, they can finish a top 3 seed and seen as a top team below the Superteams.   2nd choice: Jokic, simply because if he carries the Nuggets without Jamal Murray to a high seed, I can very well see him repeating.   DPOY: Giannis   The media rides high on Giannis all time great finals performance on both ends and rank him as the best defender in the league  2nd choice: Anthony Davis   If the Lakers flex their muscles in the regular season, they'll surely be a top defensive team with AD and Frank Vogel's coaching so he will surely be in the DPOY race   ROY: Cade Cunningham  No explanation needed.   Sleeper Pick: Jalen Suggs, Green is too obvious of a 2nd choice  MIP: The hardest award to predict because the winner is usually unexpected. So I'll go with **Jaren Jackson Jr** where after finally being healthy he'll break out to to prove he's a perfect modern day big. Let's say 22/8 and 2 blocks with elite defense."
Since when is Anthony Davis a traditional big?
"It's complete facts, but this sub has been really trying to run with the ""white man got canceled"" narrative. He's just not good and nobody cares enough. If he was playing like Anthony Davis no one would care what he said lmao."
"MVP: Curry  I can't see the Mavs having a top 3 seed this season unfortunately. I think Warriors have a good shot at it with Murray/Kawhi expected to miss a significant amount of time. Lakers may take a bit to gel and Lebron should be on full coast imo. We say how brilliant Curry was at the end of last season and he could get it this season. Embiid, Giannis, and Brooklyn are the biggest competitors imo. Luka, Jokic, and Trae have an outside shot.  DPOY: Anthony Davis  I'm not the biggest fan of AD, but his defense in 2020 was amazing. Draymond talked about one guy whose never out of shape that was - and we all think it was Davis. He's one of the most switchable players in the league. And a clear top 5 defender.He had an off year last year that i think will help build a narrative for voters. Draymond is polarizing, Gobert won too much, and Simmons is the go-to hate guy for the media. As much as i believe Dray may deserve it, this award is going to come down to AD vs. Giannis.  6MOY: Derrick Rose  Thibs trusts his guy. D Rose is gonna have his role in the offense, and I dont see Kemba being a huge threat to his minutes. Rose is going to keep his 25 minutes, and he's trusted with the ball in his hands. I dont think Clarkson will have the same season as last as his efficiency started to return to the old clarkson at the end. People aren't huge on impact guys like Ingles for 6MOY so I think Rose will take it.   ROY: Jalen Green  He's going to score more than any other rookie, and from everything we have seen, Green already has a level of efficiency to his game. I think Cade is less of a go get his and neither guy will be on a good team. Green's stats are going to jump out a bit more imo. Playing next to Hayes, Cade won't have a high enough assist total to make up for it.   MIP: Rui Hachimura  You never really know who is going to win MIP before the season. MPJ already had great counting stats and most of the improvement he needs to make is outside the stat sheet (defense, shot selection, smarter basketball). Hachimura will have much more of a scoring role without Westbrook there, and he showed some insane potential in the olympics. His outside shot is developing well, and I see a breakout year for him.  COTY: Erik Spoelstra  Exec: Bulls"
"Embiid went way past AD's level this year.   Anthony Davis is a great player, don't get me wrong. He's a very good defender, a good ISO scorer, good rebounder. But Embiid was better in every single way possible this season.   Embiid is actually capable of carrying a team. AD just isn't that guy. He has moments where he can take over, but it isn't an all the time thing."
"Anthony Davis, AD has proven that he shows up during playoffs. Embiid disappears in the shadows once playoffs arrive. Both injury prone though"
"I always will recommend a few teams   Pistons: got the newest #1 draft pick and you get to watch a team go from being ass to getting somewhere good in time. Basically see a bad team go to being good  Lakers: arguably the greatest NBA franchise. It’s got the current face of the league in Bron there along with multiple superstar/all star players in Anthony Davis and former MVP and current triple double all time leader in Russell Westbrook   Nets: has the walking bucket in Kevin Durant, the guy with arguably the best handles in history in Kyrie Irving, and the guy who can do it all offensively in James Harden  Warriors: Steph Curry is just one of the most fun players to watch and the way they play offense is fun.  Portland trailblazers or Dallas Mavericks: you can watch Dame or Luka on their respective teams do a carry job as they drag their teammates to potential playoff births and defeat.  Feel like each of these teams offer variety and you can tell where they’re each at currently in their timelines. Lakers and Nets are in win now, pistons are looking to become good, Warriors are looking to return to form then Nlazers and Mavs are fun to watch but still a ways away since the teams management need to get their shit together."
Anthony Davis becomes solidified as the best player in the league
Give Team A Anthony Davis or something instead of Sabonis/Adams. Or give them Lowry and Marc instead of Rondo and Adams
"&gt;Even though it didn't work out, why did he deserve to be clowned for it?  Because he had the temerity to be one of LeBron's teammates, be actually good, AND (and this is key), he *understood that unapologetically*.  If Anthony Davis starts putting up 40-20 in the Finals, you'll start seeing similar issues online making his accomplishments seem not ""really being that good since it's actually LeBron"".  When it comes to LeBron's teammates, the entire narrative is to denigrate them to the point where it's somehow ""poor LeBron just needs better teammates"" should they lose - likely because many of the same stans who push this narrative do so because of the nebulous GOAT argument they're battling in their head (in which Jordan, of course, had *obviously* better teammates than anything LeBron had).  As an aside, I will state that this is not LeBron's fault - mainly that he's the first social media ""GOAT of his generation"", and thus has an army of stan death-eaters that force this thinking down everyone's throats.  It's unsurprising that the media pushes it."
"If you close your eyes, you hear the same speech pattern as a young, bright-eyed Anthony Davis when he first came into the league. Amazing."
Yes. He had Anthony Davis who is historically great at his position. That’s big time star power.  If you watched the nuggets Lakers series then you would’ve seen how huge his impact is.   That’s the best teammate lebron has ever had and he’s had some good ones.
Yea Anthony Davis did sweep them but that was one series dame has consistently made the playoffs and had some big moments and runs
are you *seriously* trying to compare Julius Randle to Anthony Davis. did you just think we wouldn't notice.
"Team 1:  Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis  Team 2:  Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic"
"I'm not calling him a fraud - I'm saying Donte DiVincenzo is a more impactful player. This disagreement is a product of your undervaluing of Donte more than my undervaluing of Herro. For either of the last two years, every advanced metric has Donte being significantly more impactful than Herro. WS/48, Offensive and defensive ratings, VORP, BPM, RAPTOR, - literally all of them show a significant difference between the players, even offensively. The argument for Herro that doesn't over-rely on three series a year ago in the Bubble, is a case of matching Donte's efficiency on three more shots. It's a pretty negligible difference. Then we talk about defense. Donte's 2019-20 season he was;  * 91st percentile in Loose ball recovery rate * 93rd percentile in Steals per 75 possessions: 2.7 (he was 9th in the league in steals per 36) * 90th percentile in Deflections per 75 possessions * 94th percentile in passing lane defense  I've seen Donte **block an Anthony Davis dunk**. If you really value those 3 extra shots on the same efficiency, then you really better hope that they work through the lower offensive rating and substantially worse defense."
"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"

"A lot of people are mentioning overseas guys, but the majority of those types of guys are in college right now. Like, in 2012, Anthony Davis was easily a top 450 player in the world, even when he was still at Kentucky."
"He has over 100 other playoff games. None of the games you mentioned were part of a 7 game series, which is specifically what my point was based around.   Anthony Davis has better playoff stats than Steph and that’s all I’m gonna say about that."
"They got lifted up by giannis and they aren’t anywhere near the teammates that dudes like Lebron has had. Let’s be real here.  Every chip Lebrun has had D.Wade, Kyrie Irving, or Anthony Davis. You can make the argument that all 3 of those guys are historically great at their position"

"Yeah, Seth talked about that in his article.   &gt;In placing Anthony Davis at the very top of Tier 2 in last year’s edition, I expressed concern about the degree to which Davis’ spectacular scoring efficiency en route to the 2020 title was sustainable. While there are some mitigating circumstances in terms of the calf and Achilles injuries he battled through for most of the season, those worries were born out to a degree. Davis’ outside shooting accuracy returned to levels much more in line with career norms.   Along with the above excerpt, he showed a chart basically showing that in the 2020 playoffs, Davis shot the ball at a level far above his usual and that he returned to his normal levels of shooting this past season.  &gt;Similarly, after seeing a big jump in his self-created scoring efficiency in last season’s playoffs to nearly 51 percent, in 2020-21 his 45.2 eFG% on these attempts was nearly identical to his prior regular-season career.    &gt;   &gt;All of which is a long-winded way of noting that Davis’ season reaffirmed his status as the best second-best player in the league. Between his finishing ability and versatile defensive impact, he is a devastating playoff force when healthy. And I don’t want to foreclose the possibility of him being the best player on a team that does win a title. But his pre-Lakers playoff career should serve as an illustration of the difficulty in building a contender around him. There were some pretty good players on those New Orleans teams. Put many of the Tier 1 players on those teams in Davis’ place, and I think it’s likely there would have been a degree more success. And that’s the distinction between Tier 1 and 2."

"Anthony Davis demanded a trade, next it's going to be Zion lol"
Dwade bosh love kyrie Anthony Davis westbrook. FOH.
"Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Shaquille O'Neal, Bill Russell, Bill Walton, Larry David, Mickey Mantle, Herbert Hoover, General Custer.   Just for starters."
"&gt;PG: John Stockton (Scored in single digits multiple games in the finals with home court advantage never scored over 35, carried by Malone)  I am not a Stockton fan, but feel compelled to point out that in many seasons, single digits was not far off his season scoring average.  Not sure that necessarily represents choking.  &gt;SF: Domonique Wilkins (Similar issues as James Harden showing up in crucial moments)  Also to be fair, Wilkins played on pretty poor teams, particularly offensively, so come playoff time, all the defensive focus was on him.  He still scored a lot, but inefficiently.  And it's not like Atlanta frequently underperformed their seeding -- I think they only lost one series with home-court.  They just weren't good.  People like to credit, say, Anthony Davis with winning a playoff game against the Warriors despite being woefully overmatched.  Well, Wilkins won a game against the '86 Celtics.  &gt;C: Wilt Chamberlain  Suffice it say that going against 7 to 9 Hall of Famers in green-and-white is a tough ask, even if you have one or two on your side."
"2000 - 2007 Dirk is much more athletic than KP. But not only that, Dirk has better footwork, tighter handles, lower body strength, and a quick first step to get past most guards/wings/big men at that time -- something KP won't be able to do. Dirk in his first 7 years is more like a Giannis/Durant/Klay Thompson hybrid.  2008 - 2019 Dirk is more of a low-post, mid-range, stretch 5 kind of player like Anthony Davis/Carmelo Anthony/LaMarcus Aldridge. I think old-man Dirk is the best comparison to KP given how many injury and mobility issues he already suffered these past few years."
"D Rose finished 9th in PER in 2011.   9th is the worst PER to win MVP since Steve Nash's MVP which were 13th and 18th.  Lebron PER in 2011 was #1.   The last person to not win MVP while leading PER was in 2014-15 season (anthony davis #1, steph curry #3 won). Also the times before that, the #1 PER leader won MVP  So  only TWICE in the last decade did the NBA PER Leader not win MVP.  Lebron deserved MVP in 2011."
"I don't get how it's even debatable. Don't make a promise you can't keep is a life lesson you learn early on  And it is 100% Griffin throwing a shit fit. He's on the hot seat for setting up  Anthony Davis 2.0 in NOLA with his inability to get talent around Zion. Losing Lonzo, signing Bled and Adams, moving back in the draft this year, and your only major FA signing in 2021 was Graham to a contract he didn't deserve. F- of an offseason"
Anthony Davis fucking sucks
"Because nothing pisses me more than Raptor fans who shittalk about Kawhi.  Just go ahead and rewatch the last month of that playoffs. He was obviously hobbling, could've opted not to play, you know to preserve his health. Even back then he was borderline injury prone. But instead he hobbled his way to carry your ass to a fucking ring. And in the process probably he has become legitimately injury prone, thanks to the hindsight for the last 2 seasons I think we can safely say that.  He risked his body to win a championship for a team he got traded and we're pretty sure he didn't want to be traded to the Raptors, it wasn't a similar situation to Anthony Davis for example.   I get why Spurs fans are still pissed about Kawhi and probably I would be too if I were a Spurs fan. But I will never understand why he's being constantly demonized by other fans, especially Raptor fans. He was a free agent and he chose to go home. That's a boss move in my book. Walked the walked and did what he wanted to do afterwards. What the fuck else do you want from this guy??? What could've you wanted???"
"I agree on lebron. He is the best way to make the finals, but his lack of system has destroyed his own team when he leaves. It is not the coach's fault, Blatt wanted a system offense but LeBron wanted no part of it. Again it works, but it enhances LeBron while fucking over his teammates. You go from one guy dominating the ball and creating for you and then he goes off and then what? That isn't even a role so you can't replace his talent at all. Rondo did it somewhat well as he played a similar style(btw this flaw holds true for guys like Luka and harden too). Generally speaking it has always made his own teams look bad when he's out.  Love went from a 26/13 player to a scapegoat over night because he went from an inside the arc player to a fucking stretch big. Turns out he was not meant to exclusively.be a stretch big and that's an issue, but no one cares and just blames him.   Anthony Davis does not get enough credit for 2020. He was our best player for 3 series. People joked about LeBron coasting because ""the 4th starts and he has 10 points and then he finishes with 25, crazy"" except the game would typically be out of reach by that point. He turned up fully in the finals and got finals MVP meanwhile AD's dominating playoffs on BOTH ENDS is forgotten one month into the regular season."
Anthony Davis was our best player and that's kind of obvious. We lost game 1 with him playing poorly and won game 2 and 3 while he led.  The mvp stuff was all narrative. The media saying LeBron just deserves a mvp doesn't make his case nor does everyone crediting him for our amazing defense while.our team was full of plus defenders with an elite defensive coach.
"I mean come on, he's playing with Anthony Davis, a top 5 player in the league when healthy. If Lebron wins 2 more chips and AD wins FMVP do you really think Lebrons legacy wouldn't be positively affected? Especially 20 years down the line?   I'm also confused on the expansion era talk and the playoff record? The Jazz are probably the best team ever not to win a title..because of MJ. Nor did anyone have 3 of the top 20 players on the same team in the 1990s, so how in the world was talent more stretched thin than now? Guys like Giannis are not favored now, not because they're bad but because they don't have 2 more superstars.   As for the playoff record, MJ was playing the Celtics and Pistons in the 1980s..what exactly are you expecting? For the Bulls to beat some of the best teams of all time consistently without much help? It's a miracle (and luck) the Bulls even made the playoffs every year."
"Anthony Davis, Kawhi, Dame. Kyrie"
"I'm not one of those dudes saying Luka is king of the league or some shit, but I think he's got a really strong good case for top 6-9 range. I think he's just outside that top tier group with Giannis, Kawhi, KD, Steph, Bron. But he's definitely in the same tier as like AD, Dame, &amp; Jokic.  I'd say Anthony Davis on NOP is a good comparison for the hype Luka gets. AD in New Orleans before forcing his way out:  - Only went to the playoffs twice in 7 years in NO and was still widely considered a top 10 guy.   - Had 3 All NBA selections. Hard to see Luka not getting at least one more in the next 4 years.  - Teams were similar in quality outside of Luka/AD....just a bunch of role players being asked to do too much.  I remember being so annoyed with the hype around AD being called a top 5 guy in like 2017 when he still had yet to win a single playoff game, so I definitely can understand why people would be annoyed with all the dick-riding Luka gets before he's won anything."
"From what I've been downvoted for about in the past, I'll put this one out here again:  The NBA awarded New Orleans the #1 pick in the draft and Anthony Davis to attract a buyer for the team.  They bumped the historically bad Charlotte Bobcats to the #2 spot."
&gt; Are you comparing Goran Dragic to Anthony Davis?  I'm talking Bam you goof lol  &gt; Link it.  https://www.cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/summary?season=2019&amp;seasontype=regseason&amp;start=10/1/2019&amp;end=10/15/2020&amp;opp_def_rank=top
"Because the Lakers made it look easy. They were a well oiled high IQ team lead by LeBron James and an in his prime Anthony Davis. To top it off, they were bigger and much more athletic at every position than every other team and can be exhausting for their opponents over a 7 game series. On offense the opponent had to work harder per possession because an advantage wasn’t being created when every lakers defender on the court was bigger and just as fast as you. On defense, the opponents couldn’t guard dudes more athletic or bigger than them."
only way gotta be health reasons for not getting to the finals. Them not winning the finals healthy is going to only be because they have no one who can contain Anthony Davis
I mean the Bobcats/Hornets were literally 1 pick away from both Dwight Howard and Anthony Davis in different drafts...
&gt; That's fucking delusional to say lol. You think you can take AD and whoever was the 3rd best guy on the Lakers out and have them beat the healthy Heat? That's what Miami was dealing with  Are you comparing Goran Dragic to Anthony Davis? You’re fucking delusional lol  &gt; It's paywalled  Link it.
"Anthony Davis is drastically overrated. Many people list him as a top 2 to 5 player, but I think he’s in the 10-15 range. My reasoning is that he’s very good at a lot of different things, but doesn’t have any truly elite skills that separate him from the other top players. He’s a super good defender, but not better than guys like Giannis or Leonard, who are also superior offensive players. Add in his lack of availability and it gets worse."
"Dame was the fourth biggest problem there.      We were first and foremost outmanned, as Pelicans were a terrible matchup with Anthony Davis and the premier defensive guard. We were outcoached where NOP figured out how to stop Dame when nobody else bothered to in the regular season. Dame did an okay job of getting good passes out of the doubles but nobody made shots.      After all that, Dame could've been better.      I don't really disagree with the statement overall though. Dame has been disappointing in playoffs more than reputation implies. It's  part because he's had niggling injuries or just plain exhausted by time we get to the playoff series we lose. Often we've just run into the team that makes the final. The Denver failure was the first truly disappointing run we've had IMO, and we lost our coach as a result."
I'm not sure he will. Especially if you're asking him to guard guys like Anthony Davis or Ayton or Jokic.  It would also allow Gobert to play zone which is not good either.
"Bro I remember growing up and watching Anthony Davis. Like real AD, old-school AD, not this injured, day to day, nonsense. Anyway I remember AD winning it all with the Lakers with an otherworldly shooting performance. Feels like yesterday even though it was soo long ago."
Definitely solid.   Carmelo Anthony / Anthony Tolliver / Big Baby Davis
Players take note of that type of stuff too. Anthony Davis' dad said he never wanted his son to play for the Celtics after what they did with IT.  Loyalty doesn't exist for the most part in the NBA but sometimes a franchise has to suck it up and value loyalty for the long term good of their franchise.
"Anthony Davis was sat BY the Pelicans because they didn't want him to get hurt, AD himself actually wanted to play. Ben isn't going to sit out on his own accord, he's supposed to be making $35,000,000 this year. If he doesn't play at all then the Sixers don't have to pay that contract."
"Anthony Davis was sat by the Pelicans when they were having issues with him, only way Ben increases his value is if he comes back showing improvement.  Other teams aren’t stupid, everyone watched the playoffs."
Anthony Davis maybe?
"&gt;yall downplay Wade as washed and injured yet think Pippen was in his prime for the 2nd 3-peat  I specifically said only the 4th season he wasn't.  I'll be citing RPM, as it primarily revolves around +/- and is the best metric I'm aware of when looking at single seasons:  [http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm)  Wade's in the 4 seasons with LeBron, in order:  4.12, 3.88, 3.35, 0.20.  The metric doesn't go back to the Bulls' first threepeat, or the 72-10 season, but starting with '96-97, Pippen was 4.77, then 2.54 in Jordan's last Bulls season.  So Pippen's second-to-last season with Jordan was better than every single of Wade's with LeBron, and using extrapolation he was probably also better in the 72-10 season.  And this is ignoring how good Jordan's other teammates were; more on that in a bit.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Cavs were a worse supporting cast? lmk when Pippen was dropping 40 bombs and hitting Game 7 gamewinners. or how many 3pt snipers Lebron had vs. Jordan.  Come back with real stats, instead of these vague generalities... that even at face value are mostly bullshit.  Pippen never scored 40?  BRUH.  One of Jordan's most famous plays was an assist to Kerr.  Pippen was also a way better defender than Kyrie or Love.  And the league barely shot 3s during Jordan's entire career, so that's also really weak.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;calling either of the 3-peat Bulls a superteam is so ridiculously laughable. \[...\] if you think the Bulls were a superteam, then so are the 19-20 Lakers  Your supporting evidence is so compelling!  Here's mine:  That page above doesn't allow for showing by teams or multiple seasons per player, for some reason, so I'll just look at the '96-97 Bulls, their 4 highest rated players by ""WINS"" (RPM win shares), then do the same for the '19-20 Lakers, each ignoring Jordan and LeBron.  I'll include their RPM in parenthesis.  All numbers rounded to closest tenths.  I'll also include what was quite likely LeBron's best Cavs supporting cast, the '15-16 year:  * The aforementioned Bulls:  Pippen 15.2 (4.8 RPM), Kukoc 6.4 (3.4), Kerr 6.4 (2.4), Kukoc 6.4 (3.4), Harper 5.3 (1.9).   * '19-20 Lakers:  Davis 7.2 (2.5), Green 4.1 (1.2), Caruso 3.0 (1.4), Bradley 2.0 (0.1). * '15-16 Cavaliers:  Love 7.2 (2.1), Dellavedova 5.6 (2.2), JR Smith 4.8 (0.7), Frye 4.1 (3.0).  Notable:  Kyrie, who you probably think is better than prime Pippen, had a fucking negative RPM that season at --0.28.    The Bulls core in the second threepeat practically stayed the same, to my knowledge.  Unfortunately RPM hasn't been done for the playoffs, but it's enough to prove that the second-threepeat Bulls without Jordan, whom you think dubbing a superteam as ""ridiculously laughable,"" was EASILY better than LeBron's '19-20 Lakers teammates, and his Cavs supporting cast that he eventually won a championship with.  It's tedious to look through the lists the way they're displayed, but glancing through a couple of LeBron's Heat years, it doesn't appear that any of them are obviously better than the '96-97 Bulls.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;5 seasons when 2 of which were when he was 38 and 39 coming off years of retirement? and 3 seasons being his first 3 in the league when he also had a broken foot?  Did you space out when I said in literally the next sentence, ""*That includes his first 3 seasons, the major injury one the Bulls were 9-9 at the time*""??  Let's take it further.  LeBron entered the league a couple years earlier and without the benefit of college.  If we start the comparison of when their birthdays were only a few months apart, it'd be LeBron's second season.  Ignoring LeBron's rookie, Jordan-was-in-college-at-same-age season, LeBron's team had a winning record in every single season when only accounting for games he's played in.  The Cavs [were 41-39 in LeBron's games in his sophomore season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01/gamelog/2005), and the Lakers 28-27 in LeBron's games in his first Laker season (there's a line on the game logs by season pages saying the team's record in games the player played in); no other LeBron team got close to a losing record with him.  Comparably, Jordan's first season Bulls:  [38-44](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01/gamelog/1985), 9-9, and 40-42.  There's your apples to apples comparison.    * MJ seasons with winning record / without:  10-3, even ignoring his Wizards years. * LeBron seasons with a winning record / without, ignoring rookie year:  17-0, including many shitty teams.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;5 seasons when 2 of which were when he was 38 and 39 coming off years of retirement? and 3 seasons being his first 3 in the league when he also had a broken foot?  I'm talking about Anthony Davis.  His team success history was dogshit before he joined LeBron, as I said making the playoffs only 2x in 7 seasons.  And those two were 1st and 2nd round exits.  AD is a great player, but if your idea is, ""the '19-20 Lakers didn't have as many solid players as the Bulls dynasty, but AD was such a superstar as to make up for it,"" the advanced metrics show that to be false.  **If you're going to retort to this, come back with some real, large-sample-size statistical analysis; not tiny sample-size stats or vague generality crap.**"

"There's a difference between kids and men. If I was an NBA team I would pick 18-year-old Anthony Davis over a 30-year-old Luis Scola every single time, but if I'm just betting money on who would win in a 1 on 1 game, I'm taking a 30-year-old Luis Scola. There's just so much knowledge he has acquired over time and he knows how to get to his spots.  In this case a team of former NBA players is going to win just from sheer experience and talent."
"No, I respect teams that back a player that literally fucked his body for the team.  Your organization and fans can NEVER bitch about player loyalty.   ""find me one example of a player saying that they aren’t interested in the Celtics because we traded IT to play with LeBron fucking James.""  I didn't say that. Not because you traded IT to play with LeBron, but because you fucked IT over after he gave his body and mind, PLAYED THROUGH INJURY AND THE DEATH OF HIS FAMILY MEMEMBER, what more could any team expect, what more loyalty could any team expect from a player? All your team had to do is return that loyalty and instead they fucked him.  Anyway I could find examples but you would make up excuses as to why they don't count. Just off the top of my head Anthony Davis camp said they weren't interested in the Celtics after how they treated IT"

"2019 is probably be the goat offseason. 2016-18 were all pretty crazy too but 2019 was nuts  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   Kemba Walker   ALL switched teams, and more then a few of them were pretty unpredictable"
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
"&gt;Anthony Davis 207 552 .375  &amp;#x200B;  I'm iffy about the Westbrook trade, but I'm really hoping for the potential big upside that AD stops spending most offensive possessions playing like a guard.  He's ungardable down low; stay there!"
"I think that's the thing.  Orgs should get out of their own way.  He never should have played injured from an organization or player prospective.  It was stupid.  Remember the Lakers trotting out Anthony Davis injured during the 2021 1st round vs the Suns? Yeah,  that could have been a nightmare.  It's not worth it for branding.  It's not worth it for the damage that can happen between players and orgs. It's just bad for basketball. Period."
"We basically do send our best 12 every year. Stats wise, 4 out of the top ppg leaders in the NBA post season were on the team. Outside of players being retired, usually we do have our best players. It's sort of difficult to know if Chris Paul or Russel Westbrook should be playing in front of Dillard. And Kyrie Irving should definitely not have been on this team. LeBron is retired from international basketball I believe. I think the only one who did not play that should have was Anthony Davis."
Statiscally speaking KAT is better than Yao or at least equal to.  Embiid is.  Jokic is.  And what are we classifying Anthony Davis as in this hypothetical?
anthony davis
"It was the standard for stars, especially in the playoffs. You're saying you grew up in that era and yet are acting like efficiency was a relevant metric. All of those players I mentioned had efficiency rating at or just below league average, especially in the playoffs, because offenses slowed down and isolation frequency increased, with little to no spacing.   I'm saying you're lacking nuance because each one of your takes...lacks nuance.   You say the Knicks weren't very good. Absolutely no analysis of how they were consistently one of the most injured teams in the playoffs with several key players routinely missing games and Melo being the only one to actually produce. You're lacking nuance because you're disregarding team context, health context, ALLL context to push a narrative that doesn't exist statistically.   Like in your very next paragraph you say melos trade prevented him from getting a star guard when we've already shown how your imagined history was impossible given contract situations and the lock out, and the contracts they had on the books. You're inventing an impossible scenario and judging Melo for it not happening, even though, again, what Melo did was and is ROUTINE for all star players. It's what Paul George did, it's what Kawhi did, it's what Anthony Davis did, it's what Jimmy Butler did, it's what Westbrook did, it's what Kyrie did, it's what Harden, did and I could really go on. You know why none of them get judged for that? It's because it's a teams job to make those decisions. Blaming a star for what a team chose to surrender in a trade is foolish. Blaming a star when the guy he went to play with breaks down is extra foolish. Your argument would be akin to blaming AD if Lebron tore his Achilles and came back with the impact of Rudy gay. But you've been fed a narrative for years so it's easy for you to lean on that as opposed to actually critically analyzing.   Like let's be real here. Your argument is Melo wasn't a winner because he couldn't carry a less talented nuggets team over the spurs and lakers in his early 20s. He's a diva because he asked to be traded like virtually every other star. He's not a winner because he didn't adjust his game for a mediocre point guard who would turn out to be a back up for his career. Because the knicks managed themselves into a corner and key players to the roster were incapable of staying healthy. Your takes aren't built off statistics or actual basketball analysis. It's off tabloid journalism."
What if Anthony Davis did not hit that game winner in 2015 to knock out OKC out of the playoffs by one game?
Anthony Davis. Dwight Howard
Anthony Davis and the Pelicans. Because nobody wants to play there.
"Personally, I think Giannis has better physical attributes than KD but KD has the finesse that can't be measured in pounds lifted or seconds to run a distance. The closest thing we've ever seen is a young Dirk or KG. Or maybe do we lump Anthony Davis into there? All three of those guys are close to KD in some measure. If we take into account the era they played in, KG wasn't gonna be working on his jumper as much and that's legit what made Dirk so special.   Honorable mentions: David Robinson was an absolute animal physically."
Reality is Lakers fan fiction  Remember when LeBron signed here to make movies then a year later we traded a bunch of busts for Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis for the 5th time. Keep pretending he didn't force it though.
"Anthony Davis forced a trade, went where he wanted, Harden forced a trade, went where he wanted. You treat your superstar players well or you end up losing any possibility of acquiring more."
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
I’m not even sure why?  Did he kill someone? Or is this still about the Pelicans and his ruffles collaboration…  Just seems like the most waste of energy to hate Anthony Davis…
Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis
"If Westbrook is healthy hes a walking 20/10/10 with super high energy.  Hes also an above average defender. Jrue is a great defender but u don't know what ur getting from him offensively on a day to day basis.   Westbrook is def better than holiday its not even a question lmaoo  Westbrook may have weakness but basketball is a team game. Just like jrue had giannis to score 40 pts every game and play defense, Westbrook has lebron and Anthony davis and a bunch of shooters.   Lakers really got the last 2 assist leaders surrounded with all elite shooters. Not to mention the lob threat of ad lebron and Howard, even Jordan now as an end of the bench guy just incase."
"For the majority of his career he was at or slightly below league average efficiency, but with much greater volume. His efficiency should rise back up given the decrease in his volume as the 3rd option, that's not a hot take.  He's been an average defender for the majority of his career, but Vogel is the first defensive-minded coach he'll be under, and their def are competent defenders on the Lakers, so I expect him to be at worst average defensively. That's not even accounting for the reduced usage which will allow him to expend more energy on that end.  This last point is the most valid concern, and that'll hinge on AD's shooting while also playing at the 5 for crucial matchups ([which is something they already apparently agreed upon](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22601457/anthony-davis-told-russell-westbrook-hed-play-center-more-make-trade-work-lebron-james-lakers)).   But LeBron's shooting has been underrated, he shot 36.5% on 6 3s per game, and that increased to 37.5% on 8 in the playoffs. And with Russ to take over some of the playmaking roles he should get much easier looks at 3 to make the defense pay if they do sag off him."
"He pulled down 8 rebounds a game and averaged like 13 points, at around 28 minutes a game.  That's almost better production that season than Gasol and Jordan. As a rookie. He'd still be on the bench, but lets not pretend Anthony Davis wouldn't be an incredible asset as the 6th-8th man."
2022  * PG: James Harden * SG: Kyrie Irving * SF: Lebron James * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Anthony Davis
"Initially read that as ""Anthony Davis nearly becomes quadroplegic"", woof."
"Lebron, Carmelo, Westbrook, Rondo, Dwight Howard, Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, Trevor Ariza, DeAndre Jordan, Wayne Ellington. That's a very deep playoff team and it's not losing to anyone. Miles better than that Heat team."
I dont think the 2020 Lakers with that version of LeBron would beat this Nets team which is the other part of the problem. And I think the 2020 Lakers will be better than the 2022 Lakers overall.   The problem for the Lakers is the overreliance on LeBron which is partially a reflection on Anthony Davis. Who internally the Lakers were hoping would be able to take the mantle as the best player on the team by LeBron's age 37 season and be a guy who could be the best player on a championship when LeBron is still a great 2nd best. But I dont think anybody really has confidence in this. You were hoping AD kind of had another mini leap in him and when he's not hitting like 56% of his jumpers in the bubble it hasnt happened.
Nets took the Bucks to 7 OT with harden on one leg and no Kyrie. Lakers we’re almost pushing with the Suns and we’re missing Anthony mfin Davis. They easily meet in the finals healthy.
"Absolutely they are. Granted a lot depends on what Klay looks like when he comes back and if Otto Porter jr can stay healthy, but the combination of shooting and defense they now have is super enticing when coupled with young athletic guys like Wiseman Kuminga and Moody. We saw last season that health can’t be assumed, especially with guys like Anthony Davis, Harden, Kyrie, and an aging Lebron being the focal points of the league’s two front runners. The NBA playoffs have always been a war of attrition and the Dubs are rested and reliant on health like the rest of the league. Favorites-Not at all. Contenders-Yes."
Players with a greater legacy than George Karl on the ~~2012-13~~ 2021-22 Lakers:  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Carmelo Anthony  Dwight Howard  Rajon Rondo  Marc Gasol  DeAndre Jordan
"If Anthony Davis won an MVP and a western conference finals for the Pelicans and asked to be traded in his 30’s, people wouldn’t care as much. Barkley gave his all to the Suns well before asking to be traded."
"Barkley was waaay worse, he threatened to retire if he wasn't traded to a contender. He did have a prefered destination, he actually said Houston was his first priority.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1996/08/19/barkley-traded-to-the-rockets/1f30d680-5188-406f-b2d8-e2e95405d759/  &gt; The Houston Rockets' summer-long pursuit of Charles Barkley is over. The Phoenix Suns have traded the star forward for four players.  &gt; ""I'm very excited; obviously it's something I wanted to do,"" Barkley, vacationing in Philadelphia, told Phoenix television station KSAZ today. ""Houston was my first priority.""  &gt; Barkley's relationship with the Suns soured last season, and he has said he would retire if they didn't trade him to a contender.  &gt; Barkley said he was pleased with the way the deal had worked out.  &gt; ""I'm excited because . . . I called the shots,"" he said of the trade. ""When push comes to shove, I think you have to stand up to the system.""  AD also had a ""list"" of preferred destinations:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2867784-anthony-davis-confirms-knicks-made-final-cut-on-trade-list-before-lakers-deal  AD never threatened to stop playing and he would have played for any team he was traded to, he just wouldn't have re-signed with them."
"Lol you have to be on crack to think he’s a more impactful defender than Anthony Davis or Draymond Green,"
"&gt; “They can trade for him, but it’ll be for one year,” Paul says. “I mean: If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020.   https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis"
"I hope nobody honestly believed Anthony Davis was going to play more Center this season lol. Even if Gasol leaves, they're not playing AD at center lol. He doesn't want to do that and so he won't."
[Klutch broke the rules in going public.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2818278-pelicans-anthony-davis-fined-50k-for-agent-rich-paul-publicly-requesting-trade)   If a player wants to decide where he is going to play then he shouldn't sign a multi-year contract. If he wants the security of signing a long term contract then he should honor it. I expect this nonsense will be dealt with in the upcoming CBA negotiations. $50K is nothing.
"Bro, you have LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and a bunch of solid role players in your acting like your team's trash or something. We stacked the deck just like you guys did the last few years."
"As you say it's theoretical, but tanking and acquiring assets is the easy part. The hard part isn't Sam Presti acquiring every pick in the league it's turning those picks into a contender. Hinkie never had to do the hard part so we don't know.   Do you trade Jason Tatum for Kawhi? How about for Anthony Davis? Do you trade up for Markel Fultz to finally solve your guard problem? How about trade for Jimmy Buttler? Sign Al Horford? Trade for Kyle Lowry? Hinke never had to make any of those hard decisions. He essentially gets to have a reputation for being a genius for doing a long tank job and never had to make any of the hard choices that carry risk. All the risky moves were made by others and they get the blame for them not working.  Personally, I don't think Philly would be significantly better off. Despite Philly fan's consternation most of the moves over the last 3-4 years have been pretty defensible. You have to take some risks to turn a rebuilding team into a contender a lot of times those moves won't work out."
Celtics definitely would have made Tatum available for Anthony Davis if they thought they could resign them which is why Lakers fans and Celtics fans kept arguing about whether a deal centered on Ingram would be better.
"The reason this is even a thing is because it has ALL the big bulletin points  • Lakers  • Bron  • Clutch  • Rich Paul  If you make an article involving 2 or more of these you will get comments, shares and likes.   The craziest part to me is that no one says anything for Houston to only have gotten picks from their top 5 player with multiple years remaining, but the pelicans get an absolute haul for Anthony Davis, and somehow the lakers are still the bad guy😂 It’s literally a case of “star player doesn’t wanna play for horrible organization” we’ve seen it hundreds of times"
Yeah everyone forgot Anthony Davis was good because he sat out 15 meaningless games. Astute observation detective
"Jokic, giannis, embiid, curry, Durant, harden, Lebron. Those are names off the top of my head that are better than Tatum. Could argue others also like lillard and Anthony Davis, doncic etc. But typical delusional celtics homers."
"Dame is legitimately one of the worst defenders in the league, his team in part has always been too cos of it. Yet idiots will tell you he’s better then Anthony fucking Davis, because the difference between generational DPOY defence vs complete horse shit has little effect on average viewers players evaluations. Even people here were saying this, sad. I blame media for never discussing anything technical."
Anthony davis - the uninjuring skill
Pogba is more like Anthony Davis to me. He has all the tools but isn’t consistently great.
"It’s not really. The only question is who starts at the 2 and if AD starts at center.  It’ll most likely be: Westbrook, Bazemore, Ariza, James, Davis with Nunn, THT, and Monk coming off the bench first, and Dwight/Gasol/Anthony playing situationally."
&gt; Lakers fans who forget they managed to get bounced in the first round with Lebron and Anthony Davis and now turned their roster into a retirement home  you saying this just makes you sound dumb
"Anthony Davis will carry you just like he did in 2020. If you have supposedly the greatest player in the history of basketball plus 6 future Hall of Famer's who have very little athletic aging what's the problem? And I think Melo is going to be the one who surprise carries as well btw. When he loses weight and gets in shape like in the bubble he looks as good as he did in his Knicks prime because he never got in shape during his career before. I expect him to be the one who hits the huge clutch shots for LeBron. Westbrook should honestly come off the bench, he would be the greatest 6th man in history because he can carry a bum squad but messes up the flow for other superstars.  Dwight and rondo fit perfectly in their roles, who's a better role player big man than Dwight for that pay?"
Prepared for the inevitable “LOL CAVS SUCK ECKS DEE” from the mouth breathing Lakers fans who forget they managed to get bounced in the first round with fucking Lebron and Anthony Davis and now turned their roster into a retirement home
"non-traditional, eh?  let's do Dwight Howard at PG, Anthony Davis at SG, Marc Gasol at SF, Malik Monk at PF to show OP why he deserves to play, and Rondo at C     &gt; bring on IT  no"
"The fact that only one #1 overall pick has been the best player in the class in the last 17 years (Anthony Davis, two if you count Zion but that class is still young) is astounding to me."
"Yeah and it's not the old cats, it's the 27 year old Anthony Davis."
"Sorry, Irving and Love are not locks for the Hall of Fame.    Irving may not even be healthy enough to play out his career and Love lost a lot of time.  Anthony Davis - it is too early and he is injury prone.  Westbrook may be a chance and last time I checked he didnt play with Lebron yet.  Jordan and Magic plays with the same guys consistently for years, and for the most part they were hardly ever hurt, actually played and there was good ownership in place.  Cavs ownership has always been a joke and was a joke the entire time Lebron was there.  The owner is a moron.  So instead of telling me "" I say stupid shit "" last time I checked Rodman, Pippen and Kukoc and Kareem were hardly ever injured if at all, while this group of clowns, Davis, Westbrook and Irving and Love are ALWAYS injured.  Injuries dont make you into superstar or hall of famer.  You actually have to PLAY.  Also, as I said, Westbrook never played with Lebron yet.  Kareem played with Magic for years, Rodman and Pippen with Jordan for years, not 1 or 2 or 3 years, but longer than 3 years.  Kareem was hardly ever hurt which is why he is top 5 all time.  So the comparison is not valid."
"They'll ""blow it up"" when LeBron retires - which basically means building around Anthony Davis."
"Seriously, it's still Westbook, Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Harden and Durant along with Carmelo, Dwight, Rondo, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus and Paul Millsap, all in one series.   Even with a bunch of these guys as old as they are it's still a crazy matchup."
Who exactly are Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook supposed to be? Are they not all future HOF locks lmao?  The moment you even said that dumb shit you invalidated you’re entire point.   Social media didn’t create shit. A lot of us weren’t born in 2003 and actually grew up getting to watch both Jordan and Lebron lol
"For me, it’s Karl Malone. SADLY….  This is how I currently have it, subject to change:  1. Tim Duncan  2. Karl Malone (f**k him though)  3. Dirk Nowitzki  4. Kevin Garnett  5. Charles Barkley  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo (I think Giannis is better than Chuck already, but I still got him below Chuck due to the totality of Barkley’s career. I think he will definitely surpass Chuck, and possibly reach #2 by the time everything is all said and done. For me, it has always been hard evaluating active players, especially ones who are so young and likely have much more left to give. I typically tend to underrate active players as I want to pay a little bit of homage to the oldies, not fall prisoner to any moment, and be able to wait and assess a player’s career once it has actually concluded.)  7. Kevin McHale  8. Elvin Hayes  9. Anthony Davis   10. Pau Gasol  Honorable Mentions: Chris Webber, Dennis Rodman"
"My man, there were five seasons between the Lakers making the playoffs and Lebron joining. They had a stretch of 3(!) seasons without an all time great, going from Kobe to Lebron and eventually AD and now Westbrook.  Some of the notable guys who have played for the Lakers include:  Shaq  Kobe   Magic  Kareem  Wilt  Lebron  AD  Westbrook   Jerry West  Elgin Baylor  George Mikan  James Worthy  Michael Cooper  Byron Scott  Vets like Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Dwight Howard, Steve Nash,   Plus guys who reportedly wanted to play there like Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Chris Paul, etc.  I really don't think it's a stretch to say that they've been a blessed franchise. They have 17 championships, tied for the most. They had a handful of bad years because Kobe was at the end of his career and they were doing right by him. Then they botched their rebuild to an extent, until Lebron fell in their lap and they were able to get Anthony Davis for a bunch of guys who mostly don't even play for the Pelicans anymore."
"First off i dont think u know what a superstar is usually referring too. Superstars are franchise players, the only superstar lebron has had is anthony davis (d wade was past his prime) and AD is nothing compared to shaq. People like you that argue that lebron has stacked teams also tend to ignore that hes also faced tougher competition. As the league had  evolved and growed  the basketball talent pool has increased ridiculously. Think about the all star snubs people constantly talk about because of all the talent going around in the league. Not to mention that the science of conditioning, working out, dieting etc. has considerably improved making athletes even better. The 2017 warriors are considered by most to be the best basketball team ever assembled. The spurs also had a stacked team with td (greatest pf of all time) greg popovich (arguably the greatest coach of all fime) and great players in tony parker and manu ginobli. Even back in jordans era there was noone comparable to him cause the talent pool wasnt as good. Nowadays theres KD (arguably the greatest scorer of all time) giannis (most dominant force since shaq) and steph curry (greatest shooter of all time) all playing at the same time. Do you realize how insane that is? His stacked teams is immediately balanced out by the stacked talent hes had to face"
"2 other top 5?  Bosh was not top 5.   Lebron at age 22 dragged a moderate team to 66 wins, beat the dominant Detroit pistons in the ECF.   Who  was top 5 when Lebron went back to Cleveland? Kyrie was not top 5 and neither was Kevin Love.   Also who did he have when he moved to the Lakers. Literally no one. He got Anthony Davis (fringe top 5 at best) and.. who is their other top 5? Please remind me.   ""The only other player Kobe has played with Shaq"".. lol he got 3 rings with a guy who's peak is as high as MJ and is a top 10 player of all time. Also his other 2 rings he got when the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from Memphis who was arguably a Chris Bosh type.. and better than him. Not to mention Kobe also had a healthy and willing Andrew Bynum.   Yeah Kobe's team were ""organic"". Let's just forget the fact that he FORCED his way to the Lakers on draft night."
"That actual ticket featured Anthony Davis. They fucked it up after that, but it still featured Anthony Davis"
"They sucked and drafted Anthony Davis, one of the most heralded top draft picks of all time. That's what happened as a result of the Clippers deal  Fucking up in future seasons was not part of the trade"
"[oh no, Anthony Davis is upset again](https://youtu.be/lrpnlywd7aU)"
does anyone hate Anthony Davis? ive never seen anyone hate AD like that.
"I was also frustrated with the types of looks Anthony Davis was getting, regardless of who was on the court with him."
"I would have said that the opposite way tbh.   ""Anthony Davis is great, but needs a guard like Rajon Rondo to be special."""
Anthony Davis   Lebron James  Russell Westbrook   Washed up stars….. 😣😣😣😣
"I’m agreeing with AD here, I think this is a classic example of scapegoating the guy who just left, but a big part of our success in 2020 was our ability to generate offense with Bron off the court because of Rondo and AD’s chemistry. Of course we’re gonna give defenses hell with LeBron and Anthony Davis on the court, being able to go off with LeBron on the bench is what’s so valuable.  Rondo and AD’s chemistry has always been phenomenal, going back to their days together in NOLA, and that’s something our offense could really use."
"It's been a while but I'm pretty sure in 2020, Anthony Davis and Rondo was actually the Lakers worst two man lineup in the regular season lol"
Dennis Schröder had 1 lob assist to Anthony Davis throughout the entire season. Think about that.
"Right and by that logic New Orleans should have traded Anthony Davis to a team that could give them role players they could flip for late firsts instead of just taking the young star in Brandon Ingram.  Those late 1sts could have been anything, even Brandon Ingram / Eric Gordon."
Yup Pels brought Perkins in for vet leadership and he lead Anthony Davis out the door from day one lol
https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/10/08/kendrick-perkins-credited-with-introducing-anthony-davis-to-klutch-sports/  &gt; Kendrick Perkins credited with introducing Anthony Davis to Klutch Sports
"Report: Anthony Davis was frustrated...he was...in post.   For a man with as much of a size advantage as he has, it's insane that he actively fights against playing not like a shooting guard or small forward."
I'm glad we don't got Anthony Davis amirite?!
"again, its hard to say because we dont know what his game looks like if he learns how to shoot. ben simmons with a 3 point shot is a better player than anthony davis."
"Jokic got pretty close this season, 23/8/11/7 (steals) Still relatively far off though.  I could see Anthony Davis and Draymond doing it as well."
"&gt; Like if the best we could get is Bagley, Hield and picks  it's not; his return is probably higher than what reddit thinks, but lower than what morey wants. i'm a portland fan so obviously take this with a grain of salt, but you could literally get cj mccollum, another player or two plus however many picks  we can trade (which can also be flipped) to improve. cj as an actual lead guard (point guard) can give you most likely a consistent 23/3/5. i think even minnesota can attach multiple picks alone with guys like bev (once he reaches his tradeable date) and beasley?  &gt;  I would be fine letting it drag out and not paying him.   so you want to show to embiid (who just locked down long-term guaranteed money aka he's comfortable) an unwillingness to compete to spite ben simmons for a year or two? again, look at ben simmons/anthony davis/paul george/ any other max star that wanted to be traded, etc. we've seen how insignificant signing these deals are to them to reaching that goal if they want out? i get he's been playing tennis with morey, but i've also watched dame spit ""loyalty"" for nine years just to have this off-season come about.  &gt; We’re a first or second round exit either way   your ceiling sans simmons is a first round exit max, not sure why second round is added lol you lack a significant primary ball hander if he decides to not actually suit up unless tyrese maxey turns into an league leading assist leader.  the same 6ers fans that are saying ""let ben sit and fine him"" are the ones who are saying portland would be idiotic to do the exact same thign with dame.  &gt; I’m fine giving Nerlens lawyers more evidence to use against Rich Paul.  also wouldn't do shit. one person is saying ""he didn't have my best interest in mind"" while other top nba talents (lavine) continue to sign to him lol"
"That Anthony Davis can’t be a number one option, this is just isn’t true. Some fans need to learn the difference between being able to carry a team and being a number one option. When AD had a good supporting cast in 2018 they swept the 3rd seed and made it to first round. He can definitely be the number one option with the right personnel."
He is on contract for 4 years no matter what his mouth piece Rich Paul says. Sit his ass until a decent trade package comes up or Dame asks out  Anthony Davis sat for damn near half a season
That offers would have gotten you PG who wasn't even disgruntled. Or Anthony Davis.    76ers really expecting the same haul for a dude who is disgruntled and can't shoot.
"It all depends on how bad the drama actually is between Simmons and the Sixers.  He could voluntarily sit out games, but the Sixers can't just bench him without Rich Paul and Simmons having a say. [When it was really clear that AD wanted out of NOLA the Pels were threatened with fines for not playing a healthy player that wanted to play.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2820061-report-pelicans-risked-100k-fine-per-game-if-they-benched-anthony-davis) Rich Paul went to the league office and made a stink.   That's all to say that Simmons/Klutch can make things even more dramatic if they wanted to for the Sixers."
"youre 20 years old. the agent for LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Draymond Green comes and tells you that Philly will trash you and cannot provide a good team around you. He cites his other max contraft client and your current teammate being slandered in the press. He promises you that you can get out with Ben and to a team where you can be a starter and show out for your second contract. then he says that Lilliard is coming to Philly and you won’t play many minutes and you will lose your chance at $200 million. that’s bullshit, you’ve been a top 10 recruit your whole life, a first rounder, and you just showed out in the playoffs. you have earned this money and it’s time for you to get what you’re worth. are you gonna sit around and be a good little boy? or are you going to go out and be the all-american, all-conference, and all-whatever the fuck player you’ve been your whole life and get yours?  what would you do?"
"My guesses were:  * KD * Giannis (I thought maybe against the Pistons or something) * Anthony Davis * Donovan Mitchell * John Wall * Devin Booker * Andre Iguodala  I was certain of #5 and #6 and I guessed #7 was going to be either from the Warriors or Cavaliers, because he was never going to be one of the stars and for a role player, bad FT shooter to shoot at least 20 free throws he would need a lot of games."
Didn’t rich Paul do something like this with Anthony Davis and Boston too?  Why the hell should rich Paul have a say in whether Philly trades maxey or not
"It's harder than I thought, I have 28 names right now.  (IN NO ORDER)  Lebron James  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Damian Lillard  Steph Curry  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Trae Young  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Jrue Holliday  Jamal Murray  Klay Thompson  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Jayson Tatum  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jimmy Butler  Zach Lavine  Luka Doncic  Ja Morant  Kyrie Irving  Bradley Beal"
Seems slightly off-brand from him but I guess it makes sense for him to be upset when Lebron James and Anthony Davis were campaigning to bring him back but the Lakers FO said no.  What's most notable about this is him calling out Lebron and Davis by name and not just implying that is those two that wanted him back.
Chris Paul  Paul George  Patrick Williams  Anthony Davis  Moses Brown (can't think of a center)
"Chicago was a hotbed of talent, so I split them up into a couple more teams. Rose starts for the South Side Sky, who play in Wintrust Arena, along with Anthony Davis &amp; Dwyane Wade!"
Where's the 2021 updated version with Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis
"Chicago was a hotbed of talent, so I split them up into a couple more teams. Wade leads the South Side Sky, who play in Wintrust Arena, along with Anthony Davis &amp; Derrick Rose!"
"You should probably put Chris Paul and Anthony Davis on team 1, and put Shai and Bam on team 2"
Saw this pop up on my IG and thought it was pretty funny  PS: Stay safe out there   [Pelican fans do not want Anthony Davis Ruffles](https://youtu.be/jVK0Qc31JKQ)  Who's the player that you'd refuse to buy chips if they had their face on it?
"&gt; For someone to be all star calibre there has to be a reasonable shot at making the team, as you've said, and I just don't see that being true this season with his situation and the competition he'll face for the position.  Lebron has played 55, 67, and 45 games respectively in his last 3 seasons. Anthony Davis has played 56, 62, and 36 games respectively in the past 3 seasons. Of course two of those were shortened seasons, but nevertheless, both players have shown injury concerns and Lebron, as superhuman as he may seem, is not impervious to injury.  So even if you consider Westbrook will be 3rd fiddle, which I don't think he necessarily will be, there's still plenty of openings for him to lead that team just through injury concerns alone.  And to be an all-star caliber player, you don't have to be the clear obvious to make it the upcoming year, you just have to have been in the running the most recent year. No one can predict the future. It wasn't obvious Westbrook was going to end up on the Lakers until it happened."
"Bonus drama points to him for being teammates with the following players before: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kevin Love, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and even Shaq.  &amp;nbsp;  Having an opinion as an ex-teammate of LeBron James itself will get clicks. But along with that he's also a teammate of all the guys above and a lot of them either had beef with others there or have fanbases that have had rivalries/beefs with one of the other fanbases. Examples: LBJ fans vs KD fans, LBJ vs Kyrie, KD and his fans vs WB and his fans, Harden fans vs Westbrook fans, LeBron and his fans vs Celtics and their fans, LeBron and Ray Allen vs Celtics, LeBron vs Pierce, Ray Allen vs Rondo, etc.   &amp;nbsp;  There's plenty more headlines and drama I haven't even listed yet but Kendrick brands himself as someone who can provide unique, locker room insight, so it gets more juicy for drama lovers (especially when he's forced to pick a side)"
"Why are we pretending that a team with LeBron, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook making the playoffs is an ""if""?"
"Apparently you can field an all-star team of Davis players, though unfortunately I don't know who half of them are.  Baron Davis   Walter Davis   Antonio Davis   Anthony Davis   Dale Davis"
"Baron Davis  Walter Davis  Antonio Davis  Anthony Davis  Dale Davis  Despite my barely knowing who half these people are, they're all all-stars. Their bench would be pretty decent too with my leaving Glen Davis, Hubert Davis, Ed Davis, and Brad Davis off the team."
Don't sleep on the Davis squad: Baron   Ricky   Anthony    Etc...
"BTW, just in reference to your OP, Anthony Davis is not now, nor has he ever been on a supermax contract. In fact, by forcing his way out of New Orleans he made himself ineligible for the supermax extension. He's always just been a regular max player. He didn't even qualify for the ""Rose rule"" 5% increase on his first post-rookie contract [because he didn't make an All NBA team that season.](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/85001930)"
If the Lakers have Dwight and Gasol playing for them this year then Jordan would really be the 4th string center as I imagine most of the center minutes (or at least a plurality) this year will probably go to Anthony Davis. I really don't want the Lakers to waste a roster spot on Jordan. If they just want another warm body on the bench they should have kept Jared Dudley.
Wtf u think peak kg was the same level as current Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis leaving was the worst thing to ever happen to the city of New Orleans
For winning ball games: Anthony Davis   For dumb fun ( and winning): Jokic
Anthony Davis is not a top.3 player in the league
&gt; Anthony Davis has yet to show he could be the best player on a finals team.  Very dumb take.
"dudes wanted LeBron to go 2018 LeBron while still being injured, if anthony davis is injured what’s the point of risking further injury?"
For sure. Lakers are one Anthony Davis tweak from being in the 9-14 range.
Harden got benched in favor of josh smith and Corey brewer in the playoffs. And played on a finals team in 2012. He also had a historic offense in 2018.   Anthony Davis has yet to show he could be the best player on a finals team.   So I don’t know how you *prove* that. You can think it all you want. But it has very little to do with kawhi.
"That doesn't prevent players from forcing their way out via a trade, a la Anthony Davis."

That name in your flair is another dark moment at least for me. Should have been Anthony Davis but we got shafted by the NBA to help the team that moved away from Charlotte.
"Leggggggggoooo!! Right back 💪🏾 Since you're a Laker fan, check out a song by a Memphis rapper Big Moochie Grape called Anthony Davis. Song/beat go hard."
"Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, Lebron James, Carmelo, Dwight, Anthony Davis"
"The Brow averaged 61/55/100 through the first 4 games against Miami in the finals, and finished with 57/42/94, which is pretty odd considering he isn't a great three-point shooter. He shot 56/98 from the field, 8 of 19 from 3, and 30 of 32 from the free throw line.  The most surprising part of this though has to be that ANTHONY DAVIS shot 50/40/90 in the finals.  In the same playoff run he shot 61/38/82 too!!!"
Anthony Davis will be in the best shape of his career. Lots of pressure on him to be the Lakers best player.
He might do better on defense with Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard behind him instead of Enes Kanter.
"We can have an actual discussion if you want. I understand injuries happen every year. What doesn’t happen is the literal most injured playoffs in nba history. [It’s not even an exaggeration.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/sports/basketball/nba-record-all-stars-playoffs-injuries.html). It broke the all time record for most all stars missing. Not just that, it gets even worse when you consider exactly who was missing. You have Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden all either leaving early or playing on one leg. That’s 3 of the top 5 players and another top 10 player. Then you have Kyrie, Jaylen brown, Jamal Murray. All great players that would have changed the tides of their respective series. It’s clearly not just another “an injury happened” year. It’s very rare for both the eastern and western teams to make it through because the best teams in the conference all suffered major injuries. Most years the clear cut best team in the league wins, some seasons the second best team wins because of an injury, but it’s very rare for the 4-5 best teams in the league to Duke it out because 1,2, and 3 all got hurt. That’s all I’m saying."
KD didn't have Anthony Davis lmao
"Yeah because lebrons second option was anthony davis, a top 5 player, while hardens was russ, who averaged 14/5 on 40% TS that series with no defense and was left open for harden to be doubled"
"Anthony Davis has become a superstar caliber player, but I thought he’d be even greater defensively but not as great offensively as he’s become.  What I said above could probably also be applied to Patrick Ewing."
"Lowkey figured after I saw similarities with you saying   &gt;For fuck’s sake, Anthony Davis literally developed more injuries and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron  It’s the same format as your source wow quality copy pasta ngl lmfao 10/10 offseason post can’t believe I didn’t realize it 😂"
"But who do you trade away, and who do you trade for?  In my opinion, your best bet would be to trade Anthony Davis (technically probably your best player currently) for peak LeBron.  The idea of having 23-year-old + 36-year-old LeBrons on the same team is pretty tantalizing."
"DeAndre Jordan was first team so that's all you need to know.  Horford was good but his stat line was a bit underwhelming especially with Atlanta only winning 48 games. Towns had a decent rookie season, but it's hard to give a rookie All NBA honours when they win under 30 games. Anthony Davis had the numbers, but missed too many games (and New Orleans was a bad team). It's hard to argue against Pau but him and Drummond were pretty neck and neck."
"Damn, good comment. I see where you’re coming from, I think Anthony Davis is good enough for it to be a 7 game series but definitely could be wrong. I’m lucky as a lakers fan cause I’ll be happy either way"
The best of Anthony Davis and Draymond Green combined in a more athletic body.
Anthony Day to Davis missing games during the playoffs last season directly contributed to the Lakers early exit. That can absolutely happen again
"Nah Bam should definitely take 3s. He's getting better every year and shot 38% from 16ft-3pt line. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility at all that he could shoot around 35% from 3 and he is already all around the 3pt line anyway setting screens for everybody. Since Jimmy is not a great shooter himself, having only one negative shooter in the Heat lineup would help a lot with their versatility and also let Bam play more with traditional 5s like Dedmon. But mostly Bam should be aiming to be a small ball 5 similar to Anthony Davis"
"[0:23 of this video ](https://youtu.be/d6weofqRZbQ) is basically what I expect when it comes to IG    When I think of Twitter, it's just the stupid nicknames like LeMickey, ADisney, Anthony Day-to-Davis and other idiotic nicknames"
Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis
"Sure, a person's WARP in one season doesn't predict whether they're going to demand a trade and deliberately get benched or play terribly the next season, which can and has happened and would get you in trouble if you relied totally on that and not, say, who might be sick of their franchise and suddenly want to go to the Nets or Lakers.  It's fundamental to how this whole process works. A person having a high PER or WARP isn't what causes the basketball to go in the hoop. Physical processes, decisions and interactions do and you then find the number afterward.   So while looking backward from a high PER means that likely the physical processes and decisions are there that would cause the ball to go in the hoop for their team (and not for the other team) more often when they're on the floor, which would cause the player's PER to be high, those physical processes can change in ways that PER won't reflect, like Markelle Fultz injuring his shoulder or Vince Carter, James Harden or Anthony Davis getting into a feud with their teams.  Since we don't have concrete ways to reflect those physical things, the correlations, as they always do, will be good most of the time and miss massively some of the time. Which is a minefield when it comes to relying on the models."
This is definitely a thing lol rookie Anthony Davis also suffered from the anti-receding 3head
"That is honestly the best possible outcome for the Sixers. You can't win in the NBA with your center as your best player. Not possible. Hasn't happened since the Shaq/Kobe Lakers, and that was many rule changes and paradigm shifts ago. Notice how Embiid, Jokic, and Gobert ""underperform"" in the playoffs every year? Notice how Towns and Vucevic can't even make the playoffs reliably? Notice how Anthony Davis needed to team up with LeBron to do anything? Can. Not. Win. With. Lead. Centers.   The fans love Embiid too much for Morey to trade him. But if Embiid demands a trade? Well, then he ""has"" to. We already know that Embiid without Simmons is a much, much worse player than he is with him. We know that the Sixers aren't going to get anything for Simmons that is better than Simmons. So they can't win by trading Simmons. There is nothing reasonable they could possibly get for Simmons that would turn this into a championship team if Embiid is still here. But if they trade Embiid? Well, the return is going to be way better than if they trade Simmons, and you *can* in theory build a championship team around Ben Simmons.  Ultimately though the Process failed, and it failed for the most annoying of reasons: they built a perfect team for when they drafted these guys and the league shifted so far so fast in 5 years that they have an unworkable team in 2021. It's brutal."
"&gt;One has happened significantly more often than the other.  You're right about this, but I think it proves a point you're trying to fight against. There's been a number of high profile players who have asked for trades (Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden), but it's hard to find any that just showed up and played hard for their team after doing that. Some were traded before it got to that point, and in the rest it became a mess.   About the only example I can think of when someone made a trade demand and still showed up and played hard and it wasn't a mess was when Kobe Bryant did it in 2007. But IMO that's an anomaly because he had a No Trade Clause, so it led to a stalemate between he and the Lakers, where he realized any trade package the Lakers would get for him would make his new team weak enough that he'd no longer want to go play there anymore. As a result he just stayed (and then the Lakers ended up being much better than he'd expected).   I think it's far more likely that this Simmons thing gets messier and the Sixers eventually give up and just trade him for whatever they can. If you're expecting Ben Simmons to show up and play great for you guys to rehab his value, I think you'll end up disappointed."
"&gt; they feel like they have nothing to lose.   I guarantee you that Philly does not feel like they have nothing to lose where they can afford to just piss away the next couple years playing ""who can be more petty"" with one of their star players. Do you think Embiid would be on board with them screwing around during his prime like that? Philly has a lot to lose. They need to resolve this situation quickly before it becomes even more of a mess for them, and simply getting Ben Simmons in line is not their goal. They want to trade him and hopefully for pieces good enough to keep them in title contention.   We've seen other teams try to fight these battles of wills with disgruntled stars before and the teams always lose. Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, James Harden, etc. In the end the teams have more to lose and always give in. No team can stomach a disgruntled star player for very long, [no matter what they might say in the press.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30338326/sources-houston-rockets-willing-get-uncomfortable-james-harden-russell-westbrook?platform=amp)"
"Among your 3 best players you have Lebron James- historically a mediocre shooter that needs spacing to be at his best   Anthony Davis- bad 3 point shooter   Russ- awful 3 point shooter   Those 3 players will be logging by far the most minutes. It doesn’t matter who you put around them, those lanes are gonna be clogged"
Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis  Booker is not underrated neither is Trae
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis. Don't know exactly how it would go, but I'm guessing it would be a 50/50"
"That's a really good outcome for a #1 pick in an average draft.  You would be pleased if your #1 overall turned out to be a low level all-star player.  Take a look at the last 10 #1 overall picks, and Ben is clearly in the top range.  2010 - John Wall  2011 - Kyrie Irving  2012 - Anthony Davis  2013 - Anthony Bennett  2014 - Andrew Wiggins  2015 - KAT  2016 - Ben Simmons  2017 - Markelle Fultz  2018 - Deandre Ayton  2019 - Zion  Ben would be top 3 or 4 on that list, only Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving I would say are clear cut better than Ben Simmons, and both of those guys have serious injury concerns"
Anthony Davis if he plays the 5
Kyle Lowry $2   Klay Thompson $5   Khris Middleton $5   Anthony Davis $9   Bam Adebayo $6    $27    I use the rest for Hot and spicy from McDonald's
Ben Simmons   Zach LaVine   Khris Middleton   Paul George  Anthony Davis  I wanted to make a team specifically catered towards Ben Simmons strengths. Also this jumbo team is pretty awesome.  PS op you should decrease the 30.
"It's not that he represents them personally or doesn't. There are undercurrents of him steering players toward ulterior motives. Steering targets towards LeBron on team friendly deals, steering them away from competitors (Anthony Davis and the Celtics), advising others to ruthlessly hardball and flex on front offices thus causing issues (Simmons and 6ers, Davis quitting the Pelicans mid-season), having clients that are always name dropping Lakers or other big markets during negotiations, etc.  The Noel issue was egregious on several fronts. He told Noel (when he was restricted and represented by someone else) to reject the Mavs' 4/70m contract extension to instead sign a 4m qualifying offer (LOL) because Paul would get him a max contract next offseason.  Noel ended up signing a 1 year vet min with the Thunder after he was injured. 1 year later when Noel once again hit FA, apparently Rich Paul purposefully or negligently ceased communications with other teams looking to sign Noel, and thus he had to take a 2rd year of vet min with the Thunder.   The offseason after that, Noel got a 5m offer from the Knicks (by himself) and then proceeded to fire Paul once he learned that Paul hadn't been doing shit.  And I mostly believe every bit of it, because Noel was young and talented, and extremely valuable all those years. Every year I'd be surprised to see Noel end up signing a vet min for hapless teams, when teams should be giving him ~7m or so to be their primary rim protector."
George Mikan would dominate Anthony Davis and Bob Pettit would have Kawhi Leonard on skates!
Anthony Davis &gt; James Harden
"I agree in that it doesn't make him less of a superstar. I even think he should've been an All-Star last season, but he's gonna be making nearly as much as Steph Curry next season if he enters his player option. He's also costing the Heat more money than Booker, Kyrie, Jokic, and Anthony Davis are costing their teams while the latter are arguably more valuable players."
"EPM produces some results that do not pass the eye test. I personally would not say that Fred VanVleet is the best shooting guard in the league, or that Jakob Poeltl has a more positive impact on his team that Anthony Davis or Donovan Mitchell."
Anthony Davis is good value at 25/1. If he wins DPOY and the Lakers are the 1 seed I can see him being in the discussion.
"That's what it's all going to come down to, whether Wall is OK with sitting out the season or not. When the Pelicans wanted to force Anthony Davis to sit and he refused and threatened to file a grievance with the league, I remember people asking why the Pelicans couldn't just sit him the way that the Suns had with Eric Bledsoe, and the difference was that the Suns had Bledsoe's agreement while the Pelicans did not.   If Wall is cool with this, probably nothing happens. But if he's not, it could get ugly like the AD situation did. Personally I think this is all just posturing by the Rockets to try to force Wall to give a lot back if he wants a buyout so he can go play somewhere. But he has moves he can make if he isn't OK with just being told to sit out all year. Maybe he doesn't care if he plays though, or maybe there's nobody out there willing to give him anything more than a minimum to play. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out."
"In 2021 Paul George &gt; Anthony Davis  Both elite on both ends of the floor, but AD lack of health makes it very close imo"
"Yes, because it’s very clear that players who demand trades lose respect in the NBA player circle.   That’s why guys like:  James Harden, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Kawhii Leonard, Jimmy Butler, etc.  get no respect around the league. Oh wait, that’s not true at all? Weird."
Myles Turner &gt; Kristaps &gt; Doma Sabonis  Anthony Davis &gt; Embiid  Jamal Murray &gt; Donovan Mitchell  LaVine &gt; Booker
"Joel Embiid &gt; Anthony Davis  I don’t think this is a super hot take, but my reasoning towards it probably is.  Anthony Davis is absolutely not a top 5 player in the MVP and should have never been an MVP candidate at any point in his career so far.  Don’t get me wrong, he’s *very*, *very* good. Easily one of the best bigs in the game, but throughout his career he’s shown that he does not impact winning in the same way other superstars do, Like KD, Lebron, Harden, Curry, Westbrook, Lillard, etc. All of the dudes listed have carried teams to the playoffs and to the Finals, and AD is talked about like he belongs in this conversation with these guys, yet, even now on the Lakers, when Lebron is out/off the floor, the team is no better than all of his mediocre Pelicans teams. Superstars are supposed to be good enough to prevent such a steep drop off from when their co-star goes down. Just look at what PG13 did in the playoffs when Kawhi went down, or how the Nets record didn’t get any worse when the Nets were without one or both of KD and Kyrie win a stretch where Harden led the team. It would be one thing if the Lakers were significantly worse without AD on the floor too, but they’re not, and sometimes they’re better."
"He's very comfortably in the 11-15 section for me.        Top 10 is reserved for MVP level players like Giannis, KD, LeBron, Curry, Kawhi, Harden, Jokic and Embiid.      Then I'd pick 2 of Luka, Lillard and Anthony Davis to round out the top 10 with one of them unlucky depending on who's injured really"
Anthony Davis really doesn't want to play post 5 in the regular season lol
"I hate how resigned AD is to the idea that he is injury prone as well... everyone thought he was going to wait before signing a long term contract with LA so he can get the big bucks, but he ended up signing last year and one of the reasons was because hes had the ""injury bug"" his whole career.  It was almost as if he knew then that he wasn't gonna be able to be fully healthy last season before it happened - [draymond even talked about how he was so unfit when he started the season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ldqz2n/draymond_i_wont_throw_anybody_under_the_bus_im/).   When he got to the Lakers he admitted hes aware people all over the league called him soft and how he wanted to fix it, yet you always hear how he doesn't want to play center because of how physical it is.   Anthony Davis is truly so skilled and it feels like people forgot how dominant he was in last years playoffs. I want to see him at full health hes a true unicorn, and I really hope his extended offseason can be used to gain some muscle and train the right ways so we can enjoy his prime fully. I really want to see what him vs Giannis looks like in a playoff series."
"Anthony Davis actually hasn't missed that many games if you actually like... look at his game logs. The idea that he's as fragile as Porzingis or Embiid is pretty much a myth imo, he's certainly a long away away from being ""always hurt"" like you claim. This season was a pretty wide outlier from the rest of his career and it was clear (to me at least) that his injuries last season were caused by overuse (shortest offseason in history) and then compounding injuries after that (knee leads to overstress on achilles, achilles leads to overstress on groin etc). I think he's going to be way, way healthier this season than the ""day to davis"" morons on here expect. I'm more worried about LeBron's health than AD's."
"Anthony ""I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms, at night I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep."" Davis"
Has Anthony Davis been injured more often than or in uncharacteristic ways compared to the average player of his body size?
"Uhhhh this comment is wild.   Kawhi is 100% on this list. He’s a 2x FMVP and won a DPOY.   Dwight Howard won three DPOYs and was the consensus best center in the game for half a decade. He will be on this list.   And you don’t think Russell Westbrook is even “in the conversation”? He’s widely viewed as a top 10 point guard of all time, some say top 5. Russ is on this list for sure.   I think Carmelo Anthony makes it, but it’s fair to say he’s questionable. Davis I agree with you, could go either way."
"Allen Iverson   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Chris Paul   Damian Lillard   Dennis Rodman   Dirk Nowitzki   Dominique Wilkins   Dwayne Wade   Dwight Howard   Gary Payton   Giannis Antetokounmpo   James Harden   Jason Kidd   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Kevin Garnett   Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant   Kyrie Irving   LeBron James   Manu Ginobili   Pau Gasol   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Reggie Miller   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Tony Parker   Tracy McGrady   Vince Carter"
"Since then, of guys that have since started and ended their careers, you can add Kobe, Duncan, KG, Dirk, Nash, Kidd, Wade, maybe Ray Allen?   And then guys who are still active: Lebron, KD, Steph, Giannis, Kawhi, CP3, Harden, Dwight, Melo  Of guys who weren’t on the Initial list, or who I didn’t mention… Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Paul Pierce, Pau Gasol, Chris Bosh, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis all have shots.   I think guys like AD, Dame and George will be hard to evaluate because they’re in the middle of their primes and not absolutely historic, but they each have multiple all NBAs, all defense, prolific scoring etc"
&gt;Should I continue to cry about Anthony Davis being injured against the Suns? lol  Is that not what Lakers fans are already doing?
Them being injured doesn't change the fact that the team was still built around Gobert. I don't understand how you're unable to comprehend that. Should I continue to cry about Anthony Davis being injured against the Suns? lol
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"Anthony ""I want what Cade has"" Davis"
Or Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis according to Chuck
anthony “small ball” davis
It’s like giving Drummond 20 million when Anthony Davis was making 10 million. Then the Lakers would say we have no money to give him a raise
Anthony “I wish I was 6’2” Davis
Past few seasons? We’re talking about the franchise that also wasted all the years of cp3 then all the years of Anthony Davis right? This has been a trash org that’s always lucked into generational talent.
"I think the difference is strength/team defense. Butler can much more effectively defend 4s and hold his own on possessions against someone like Anthony Davis. PG I don't think is quite as versatile and Butler is little better making rotations and trying to stop shots at the rim. PG is better on the perimeter defending guards, which you could argue is the least important part though.  Butler last season was consistently great defensively. I definitely think on Minnesota/Philly what you were saying was the case, but Jimmy really locked in defensively last year."
"Just revisited the Anthony Davis AMA, couldn't hold back the laughter from almost every comment"
"Anthony Davis is not comparable to Gobert at all. Gobert is a guy who defends the rim and can dunk over shorter people. That's literally all there is to his game. AD can gaurd 1 thru 5 and can score from anywhere.   Lebron can gaurd KD better than any1 and AD can contain Harden. Not even debatable at this point. U talking abt Harden containing Westbrook, my dude if Harden is on Westbrook that's gonna leave someone else on AD or James and they will feast. U don't rly know what ur saying but its ok. Lakers are my #1 team and nets are my 2nd. Nets can easily be the best team in the nba. But any1 who watches both teams a lot and knows basketball knows that the nets are not favored in a series vs the lakers because the lakers simply out do them in more things. Passing, rebounding, (overall) shooting, depth. The only thing Nets got is that they're 4 best players are very good and they can shoot from anywhere. Other than that, lakers literally do everything else better. It's ok we shall"
Kevon Looney's face and stupid ass name really bother me   Anthony Davis' face and tendency to shoot those shit midrangers annoy me   Latrell Sprewell is a jackass and also incredibly stupid
"Anthony Davis' impact on the defensive end is top level even compared to the all time great defenders, and on offense he is one of the best pick and roll lob threats that the league has ever seen, those pelicans teams just didn't have the team success and media coverage to put him in the position to win dpoys, mvps, and championships, in fact, the moment he went to a big market team and played with another star he was 2nd in dpoy voting and won a championship, he has legitimately already become a first ballot HOF guy, and he has only just recently entered his prime"
"I've heard arguments for KD, but why Anthony Davis? It's hard to ask that question without sounding shady; I am genuinely asking though."
Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant.   In a world where all accolades are equal it’s hard to keep either out of the top 10. I’m not entirely sure who id drop off as I have a top 7~ and then a bunch of guys who can round out that top 10 that shuffle about the more I think on the question.
"This is going to sound pretty random, but the 2012 lottery was stacked and I personally thought Royce White was going to be the second best NBA player after Anthony Davis. I didn't know anything about anxiety disorders, but I just kind of figured NBA players are all maniacs one way or another and his particular problems wouldn't amount to anything."
"PG Kobe (he was a very good offense initiator for the Kobe/Shaq teams).     SG Kawhi.      SF Lebron.     PF Anthony Davis.     C Yao Ming.      This is my team and I think they’d cause a lot of problems. A young Kobe chasing Curry, Kawhi locked in on Jordan, Bron on Durant, AD on KG, and I watched Yao give Shaq all kinda problems. He neutralizes some of Shaq’s advantages in ways that no one else can."
Whenever people do these hypotheticals and you're talkin about having access to the greatest players of all time yes that team can be beaten   Isiah Thomas    Kobe      LeBron    Anthony Davis   Hakeem       And I like my chances
"The list:  1). Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets  2). Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  3). LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  4). Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  5). Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  6). Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  7). Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers  8). James Harden, Brooklyn Nets  9). Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  10). Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  11). Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  12). Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  13). Devin Booker, Phoenix Suns  14). Chris Paul, Phoenix Suns  15).

Julius Randle, New York Knicks  30). Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers"
That reminded me from the 2015 season when the Spurs went from like the 3rd seed to the 7th on the last game of the year because Anthony Davis played like an absolute god
"No one fawning over Anthony Davis? Klay. Melo.  Dude is attractive, just admit it"
"With the departure of Marc Gasol, DeAndre Jordan will indeed have a larger role in the Lakers' rotation this season.  In the playoffs, it will be different as Anthony Davis will likely be called upon to play the center more often and Howard will be the number 2."
James Soften and Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis
"I'm very glad to have Clarkson. I'm just saying its impossible to escape the Lakers media storm even when they suck. Or some player or team will have a huge night and the front page of ESPN is ""Lebron texts something to Anthony Davis"". Its fucking obscene."
Anthony Davis isn’t gonna sleep well tonight after Jordan’s declaration.
"""Healthy"" and ""Anthony Davis"". I'm not holding my breath. 2020 was the exception to his rule."
ANTHONY DAY TO DAVIS LOLLLLLLL
Did you just say you’d rather have Gasol than Anthony Davis as a rim protector?
"&gt;the corpse of marc gasol is a more effective defensive 5 than healthy, prime, perennial DPOY candidate anthony davis  you don't like basketball very much do you"

The real nugget from this list is that A. Davis assist the first ever NBA game winning buzzer beater. John Barr with the winner. Who knew that Anthony Davis could time travel?!
Same as Anthony Davis for years. You gotts win something to get recognition
Anthony Davis is a 6’10” 260lb C on defense and SG on offense
Anthony Davis dropped regulary 30 a night(even against the Warriors) and he was very far from being the best player in the world.
its up to Anthony Davis if he can play 100 games
True   Also wtf Anthony Davis is #1 all time lol
Keep KG at C he would be the best 5 possible for that team  Just an upgraded Anthony Davis
"“Here we pit LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook against Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Thompson.  Their best stars are roughly even. I’m willing to call that a wash”  they say this and still pick the Lakers to win, so are the Lakers big 3 better than the Warriors big 3 or not?"
"&gt;The nba is def going to Intervene if he holds out.   They don't need to. Pelicans had leverage to wait out Anthony Davis because they'd be tanking anyway. 6ers do not. That team is trying to win, and having a McCollum on the floor is better than nothing. If they choose to play hardball, the vets will lose their shit and Embiid will ask for a trade too   Not to mention, Ben is not ""worth it"" for the NBA."
Kawhi and the Spurs  Anthony Davis and the Pelicans
"In all fairness similar things were said about Kawhi before he went to the Raptors, Spurs fans are still mad and him and say he quit on the team.   The same thing was also said about James Harden, and  Anthony Davis when they forced their ways out of their teams. I'm not saying Ben is that caliber of player I just noticed this seems to be a pattern with players who demand trade."
"Nothing realistic if they could have gotten Anthony Davis or Kawhi Leonard something crazy like that for a couple seasons he possibly would have signed a short-term extension but the way things were, nah he was out of there"
"Even their locker room doesn't believe that, these dudes have LeBron James and Anthony freaking Davis, who the fuck would count them out.  The Lakers only concerns should be that Marc Gasol and Rajon Rondo looked done last year and they aren't getting any younger, outside of that they still have a Top 2 duo in the league, they ain't underdogs."
"That's just because Rich Paul is an agent who represents so many players, not because he's making these guys do this. Anthony Davis wanted to get out of New Orleans because the team was bad every year. Even with him putting up the kind of seasons that had him in MVP and DPOY discussions they were still always bad so he wanted out. Ben Simmons wants out because the Sixers have been perfectly clear that they want to get rid of him because they blame him for everything that's wrong with the team. It's not hard to figure out why these guys wanted to move on without having to invent some conspiracy that it's all Rich Paul's doing."
i mean lebron is a pretty good starter but the crazy thing is that they think they can win anything when their second best player is anthony davis. the last time the lakers won a ring with him was like a year ago. tear it down and start from scratch tbh shits embarrassing.
"Bro your being hypocritical as shit, yes Ben Simmons deserved criticism no one is saying he didn’t but usually your entire team doesn’t go public with how it was all your fault. You handle that shit privately behind closed doors, Philly isn’t innocent in this is at all. Also it’s a completely situation then Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons was actively in trade rumors right after the coach and the best player shit on him publicly. They’re trying to trade him and clearly don’t want him why the fuck would anyone go back to that toxic environment when they clearly don’t want you. The Sixers are just as much to blame as Ben Simmons is because they’ve sunk his value big time."
"A lot of what you talked about, nobody blames Rich Paul for.      But he represents two of the players that have exercised the most leverage of any players in the last decade and put them on the same team in the largest market.      As for Simmons, him holding out isn't tenable. If NBA players do not honor their contracts as a way to force themselves out of city, that would be the farthest extension of player empowerment yet. That's what Simmons holding out would amount to. The last and largest reach of player empowerment? Anthony Davis who forced a trade to 1 team and made it so that team was the only option."
"that's what i'm talking about above that spurred this conversation...the top 20 are really close in talent...it's just they had vastly different talent/teams around them that creates this illusion that someone was better than someone else.  like look at the top 10 players...MJ played with Scottie/PhilJ, Kareem/Magic played together, Bird had Mchale/Parish, Lebron had Wade/Bosh/Kyrie/KLove/Anthony Davis for his rings  Who was DRob supposed to win with? Sean Elliot? As soon as he got Duncan he ""won"" a ring.   So what's really teh difference btwn Shaq, DRob, Hakeem, Kareem, Duncan, etc...is it really the talent or the talent that was put next to them?"
"Anthony Davis( I think its AD I am thinking of, really dont feel like checking right now) didnt make playoffs for a long time but was considered a franchise type of player. Same with Booker. Playoffs is mostly team based.   Vuc got better but he was doing alot of the same thing for a long time but as soon as he was in playoff contention he made his first AS. He did improve but I could argue Vuc should have been in AS before that. Making playoffs increases perceived value but does it mean you are better as a player? I do not really think so. They are the same player. Trae didnt magically make playoff and become a superstar, he was a superstar but playoffs validated it."
"They’ve had a franchise for less than two decades and three owners, including David Stern as the owner at one point. They also went two years playing in another city due to Katrina.  Not sure what you want them to do. They had Anthony Davis, Jrue, Cousins, Rondo, and Mirotic yet Cousins tore his achilles, killing their chances.  Now they completely rebuilt one of the youngest rosters in the league and have two players under 25 that are all stars. Most rebuilding teams would swap rosters with them in a heartbeat if they could."
No fucking way is Ben Simmons 6’11” and taller than Anthony Davis lmao
What? Ben Simmons is not taller than Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant.
Helps to have Anthony Davis
"building teams around kobe would be way easier than building around duncan.  Kg could go from top of the key to the hoop. Duncan would never  Dirk could do turnaround fadeaways from 15ft +. Duncan would never.   Duncan's offensive game is actually incredibly poor if we're talking about top Power Forwards in the league all time.   In fact for a 7 footer who only shot within 10ft, his FG% are actually below average at 49%.  Malone, Barkley, Dirk, KG, Anthony Davis are all better offensively.   Tim Duncan and the Spurs org were a match made in heaven, and I just don't see that match just as well enough on any other team.   Organizations would have to build around Duncan's defense, and that would be more difficult to do than building around Kobe."
"Almost all the Laker flairs you see commenting on here are acknowledging this is going to be an unknown season as far as how they will come together.   And the season hasn't even started yet and you are assuming everything will be certainly one way between Lebron James, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis.  Only a hot take shit poster would say they know how this team will play with Westbrook."
2018 Cavs didn't have Anthony Davis
"You don't though. Duncan won multiple times without another all-NBA teammate. Hakeem did as well. And Dirk. And Leonard. And Giannis.  &amp;#x200B;  Ten players better than Bryant? That's really easy and in no particular order. Wilt, Jordan, Kareem, Duncan, Magic, Bird, Shaq, LeBron, Hakeem, Robinson. I would also have Leonard, Durant, Harden and Anthony Davis surpassing him by the end of their careers as basically a foregone conclusion."
"Klay, Steph, Dray, Pool, and Wiggins might be the new death lineup. Especially of Dray and Wiggins can hold up against a bigger front court like Anthony Davis or Jokic."
"You gave the Raptors a 10/10 cause of a Klay injury even though we were outplaying them even with Klay and a KD injury in which he should have never played a single minute of that series. But you then forget the Suns played a Lakers with an injured Anthony Davis, Nuggets with an out Jamal Murray and the Clippers with an out Kawhi Leonard. If you care so much about Klay and KD being injured, be consistent when it comes to the Suns who were at best the 4th best team in the West. Either injuries matter, or they don't."
"No, because DAJ was never capable of scoring more than the low teens in points per game.  When you increase volume you decrease efficiency for everyone not named Stephen Curry.  Stephen Curry has two scoring titles on all time efficiency, 63% and 60.4% true shooting while leading the league in scoring.  That's insane.  That Steph can score more points on fewer shots than any of these people is pretty wild, and putting him next to Kevin Durant who is also scoring more than any of these other people on better efficiency...that is the point I'm trying to make.  They literally combined this season for 59 points on 38.9 shots, and that's at 33 years old for both of them.  Anthony Davis and LeBron James best seasons combine for 59.5 points on 43.4 shots."
"Yeah, people acting like AD is the most injury prone star in the league are not being realistic. Look at AD compared to these other top 10 players with how many regular season games they've all missed over the last 5 seasons.  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old"
"What Simmons and rich Paul didn’t realize is he had no leverage to try to force his way out …Anthony Davis could force his way out of NO because he was in the last year of his contract and let the team know he had no intention to resign with them…so of course you go looking for the best package available so you don’t lose him for nothing…similarly, he forced his way to LA by telling Teams like Boston he wouldn’t resign there and would just be a rental so they decided not to offer significant assets…Ben on the other hand, 1-is not nearly as good as AD so teams aren’t going to be willing to gut their rosters of young talent or valuable picks for him..and 2- has several years left on his contract so is not in a position of power over teams like AD was…I think rich Paul thought he could pull another AD move and force Ben out and to his desired location but totally misread the situation and now they look like little bitches that nobody wants"
"Ok controversial takes:  I didn’t think this was too controversial, but looking at this sub I guess it is. Luke will be the face of the NBA after LeBron. Everyone brings up the fact that he hasn’t won a playoff series, but if you watch those games knowing that: the kid is only 3 years into the NBA, carrying a trash team, and playing against two elite defenders that should absolutely shut him down. He’s got loads of potential  The Magic have the best color pallet and name in the NBA, and the most potential for branding (it’s literally magic. They could make some wild jerseys). Some cosmic-themed jerseys could be sick if done right  Russell Westbrook (one of my favorite players) was never a natural scorer. His scoring was because of his aggression and imposing himself, his shot selection was often iffy and his averages weren’t great.   The Sixers brought all this drama on themselves. Teams should embrace their teammates/staff. Not automatically throw them under the bus, bringing hate from all over the league onto Ben. He was absolutely the reason the Sixers lost, but they should’ve stood with him to resolve it. The Mavs absolutely lost because of Porzingis, but they stood by him and they are still on (I assume) good terms coming into the new season.  Joel Embiid holds back, and he could be much better than he is. Knowing that he’s got bones of glass and skin of paper, he plays reserved hoping not to get injured (even though he still does). If he were healthier he’d be this generations Shaq  Hate for the bandwagon fans is bad for the NBA fandom. Box office teams like Kobe/Shaq, MJ, Kareem/Magic, LeBron/Kyrie, Curry, etc. attract fans who are curious what the hype is about. It brings in new people who don’t know much about the NBA teams, so they form an attachment to their first team (big-name team) which is then criticized by old fans  Anthony Davis is a beast, but he’s not a good first-option player   Seattle shouldn’t get an NBA team if the NBA expands. They had a chance and lost it, dozens of other cities would kill to have had an NBA team. Give a chance to other cities  Sort of building off that last one. No city should have 2 teams. The second teams should relocate somewhere to provide more fans with a “home team”. The Knicks are New York’s team, the Lakers are LA’s team. Give the Nets and the Clipper’s to cities that have wanted an NBA team  Draft expectations can ruin a players perspective. Most players coming into the NBA are still just college age kids, they need a few years to develop into role players or possibly stars. But labeling them a star from day one stunts them into being widely labeled a bust if they don’t live up to those monstrous expectations"
"Shameful! I bought my son tickets to this game so he could see his favorite player just for Anthony Davis to sit out! The NBA really needs to do something about this, now we’ll have to settle for just watching LeBron James, Steph Curry, and Russell Westbrook."
"&gt; Horford gets an overpay, Hayward gets an overpay  I think Ainge needs some blame here for this though, for misreading the market on those players the way he did. It shouldn't have been this huge surprise that someone else offered them the kind of money they got. Maybe it was to people like us, but a smart GM should not get blindsided by something like that. Ainge should have been able to sense that other teams were going to be willing to give them more than he was willing to, and should have made a decision about what to do with them a year ahead of them being able to opt out and leave (or at least at the preceding trade deadline). Simply getting nothing in return for one of your best players like that causes serious damage to your franchise, and for it to happen in consecutive seasons is pretty unforgivable (why didn't Ainge learn his lesson after Horford?).   The Kyrie thing also was something Ainge should have seen coming, as there were many stories in the press that year that Kyrie was unhappy and would not re-sign. Boston sportswriters like Jackie MacMullan tried to do damage control by saying those reports were false (probably just acting as Ainge's mouthpiece), but obviously they were accurate. If Ainge had any worries that Kyrie was going to leave, he should have moved him at the deadline as well. Doing so would have eliminated the one stumbling block to trading for Anthony Davis (Boston couldn't have two ""Rose Rule"" players on the same team), and that would have given Boston two years with AD before he could have opted out and left. Instead Ainge just lost Kyrie for nothing the way he did with Horford and Hayward. There has to be some sense of accountability there. If Ainge was caught off guard three times in two years like that, then he wasn't nearly as competent as people thought."
"I mean you say that....but do you think Harden cost himself a dime from his stunt last season?   I can get why people, especially sixers fans, would not be optimistic about him becoming the caliber of player we all agree he has the potential to be...but if he ever does reach that potential he's gonna get paid and it wont hamper his career one bit except one city that used to love him will now hate him...see Anthony Davis, James Harden etc etc.  All star 3 straight years..all NBA team 2 years ago and he's 25. There's a lot to gamble that"
"Example, Anthony Davis who after the 2018 playoffs wanted to stay in NO and left less than a year later"
"The chain of comments is based upon prime Westbrook … the comment that started this is about MVP Russ.   Regardless, it doesn’t matter. Jrue didn’t have some super amazing playoff run and there’s more than enough signs that Westbrook healthy as a third option can perform better all while clearly being a better floor raiser.   Just saying “he hasn’t been outside the first round in 5 years” isn’t a very strong argument when compared to Jrue holiday who was failing to make the playoffs with Anthony Davis lmao.   When it comes to Westbrook, the argument just turns into narratives which is why I hate discussing him on this sub sometimes. Westbrook has factually proven he can adapt, Jrue being a third option isn’t an “insult,” it’s acknowledging the gap between prime Westbrook and prime Westbrook teams to current Jrue."
"&gt;Another good example was how the Lakers managed to abuse Jokic with Anthony Davis.  Jokic is a center, dude. Being bad at defense as a center is completely different than being bad at defense as a PG. This is basketball 101 shit."
"&gt;&gt;Infinitely better defender &gt; &gt;He's still a shitty defender and who gives a fuck about PG defense anyways lol one of the most overrated ""weakenesses"" on this sub. No one expects Trae or most PG's in the league for that matter to be locking anyone down. &gt;  Nope. And when you're this bad at defense, it absolutely matters in the playoffs, where teams repeatedly abuse bad defenders playing heavy minutes, regardless of position. Another good example was how the Lakers managed to abuse Jokic with Anthony Davis.  &gt;you're listing something he's ""almost"" as good at when asked to name things he's clearly better at... lol &gt;  So? I made it clear he isn't better. Why are you angry at me discussing something that still adds to the comparison of the two.  &gt;&gt;Most importantly he was huge in the playoffs while Trae was underwhelming &gt; &gt;Underwhelming? Is this a bit? Trae had one of the most electrifying debut playoff runs for a young player in recent memory, tf are you talking about? &gt;  I don't agree, but underwhelming might be an overstatement. He was a worse scorer than in the regular season. 31% from 3 for example.  &gt;you're just making up shit for the sake of argumentation, it's cringe bro. I think Luka is a better all around player mainly because of his size and things like switchability but the mental gymnastics people go through to make it sound like they're not even close to each other are so lame. &gt;  Oh no, I'm cringe. How will I ever recover. His size and switchability makes him a better scorer and defender. So it's absolutely a major reason why he's the better player. I agree with you on that."

"You could make the same arguments about Duncan being ahead of LeBron. He should, objectively, be 3-0 vs LeBron in the finals(was up by 5 with 28 seconds to go to ring when his coattailing head coach let go of the coattails and took him out of game 6 and lost an unlosable game). Two of those series, Duncan was 35+ years old and LeBron was in his prime... AND on a super team that he had to construct because he had to take shortcuts to try to win rings. Duncan never did that. And everyone says ""well, Duncan always had great teammates"". Really? Did he?? Parker and Ginobili? Do they even make an all-star team if they aren't Duncan's teammates? Duncan never played with ANYONE as good as prime Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Wade or even Chris Bosh. David Robinson would be his best teammate in 99, a shell of his former self from injury. The only argument LeBron has over Duncan is statistically, but I think anyone with an objective take understands how selfless Duncan was and literally cared 0 about getting his stats; whereas LeBron is the polar opposite. Duncan also has arguably the greatest carry of all-time in 2003."
Anthony Davis
"You’re overthinking it, and not realizing how Randle’s playing style has evolved since his days on the Laker.  Randle shot .411 from the 3-point line last year, he’s a good defender, and can play both on-ball and off-ball at the 4 or 5. He’s also a great passer too, which will be good for when defenses collapse on him.  He also used to play with Anthony Davis on the Pelicans and it was a great fit, so there’s built in chemistry."
"&gt;but not many talented bigs.  Yeah I guess Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwight Howard aren't good enough."
"He’s not going to be the second best scoring option the Wizards this year, he’s got to share the pie with Anthony Davis and Lebron James making a finals run, his numbers will be worse just because of the other two cooks in the kitchen."
Lakers chose Anthony Davis over Andre Drummond? 🤮🤮🤮🤮
the Lakers won the title with Anthony Davis guarding the paint. the Mavericks have one of the worst interior defenses in the league. we waltzed to the rim in our series so easily Carlisle ended up starting Boban and playing zone because giving us endless open 3s was preferable lmao
"I’m sorry but like….The fact that he has a team with russel Westbrook, Lebron James and Anthony Davis in the same tier as a team led by Rudy gobert and Donovan Mitchell says all you need to see"
Anthony Davis and Domantis Sabonis are wings?
I agree. His defense doesn't even need to be that good. Be hald of what Anthony Davis is and he'll be top 10.
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"The problem is that they ONLY go to LA, NY or Miami. Kawhi had his 1 year in Toronto then straight to LA where he added Paul George. LeBron went back to Cleveland and then straight to LA where he made himself GM and added Anthony Davis.    It's not good for the league, it's not good for fans, and ratings reflect this. /r/NBA is obviously an NBA-focused community, but the NBA itself is losing ratings hand over fist."
It's crazy how people talk like LeBron James wasn't playing injured. He literally did not look like himself when he returned to the regular season and even Anthony Davis said he wasn't 100 percent after the series loss against the suns.
"You have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, I think you're good on strong forwards who can play defense."

"Yep, just trade the guy already...  **10 NBA Superstars Who Forced A Trade**   NBA players switch teams all the time, whether through free agency or a trade. Sometimes a player is traded because another team wants them to improve their roster, or because of salary cap constraints. But other times, players get traded because they request the trade themselves, and then end up at a destination that they prefer.    NBA superstars’ trade requests carry a lot of weight. These players are the face of the franchise, and are usually the highest paid players on a roster. If they request a trade, then their franchise usually trades them to avoid dealing with a disgruntled superstar, and in hopes gaining value for the future in return, such as high draft picks. If the franchise holds out, then the player forces a trade using the leverage that they have. Here are 10 superstars throughout NBA history that have forced trades to other franchises:      1. Anthony Davis   2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Wilt Chamberlain   5. Chris Paul   6. James Harden   7. Kyrie Irving   8. Vince Carter   9. Carmelo Anthony   10. Paul George"

Anthony Davis in mid season form hitting the deck 😂
"For most Pelican franchise records, you'll find 4 names. Paul, David West, Jrue Holiday, and Anthony Davis."
Ridiculously good. Top 5 player easily.  Imagine if Anthony Davis was always healthy and could average 27.5 points on  58% shooting.
"Anthony Davis is the obvious comp and he loves playing the 4.   And just because they may have to move Allen later doesnt mean you cant play them together year 1. Playing Mobley at the 4 lets him develop more perimeter skills, which the Cavs want him to do. And they can still let him play the 5 in game. Mobley is skinny af rn too, give him time to bulk up so he can play inside better. Defending 4's probably will probably help alot too. He wont develop perimeter defense if he only plays the 5 and only guards smaller guys on switches. If he did that then either you hope he's naturally talented enough to do it or you get Rudy Gobert out on the perimeter a few years ago (Rudy has gotten a bit better lately)."
"This is what the league created by developing max contracts. If your not going to let the free market decide player value then obviously the players are going to have plenty of agency to do as they please. Simmons is just working off the freedoms afforded to him by the players infront of him who showed how abused the system is. Anthony Davis and James Harden never go to the Lakers and Nets respectively if they are offered free market contracts. The Nets wouldn't be able to afford Harden after paying Durant, and Davis wouldn't be able to turn down New Orleans god father contract offer that they would have made in desperation"
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
&gt; It was reported  This version of events is directly from Rich Paul.   https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis
"It was reported former Pelicans GM, Dell Demps, went over Rich Paul and contacted Anthony Davis directly about the trade request. Players pay agents 4% to 10% of their contracts to deal with negotiations. Attempting to circumvent an agent is simply bad form. Paul and Davis made the request public after that and paid the $50,000 fine from the league.  If that report is to be believed, Davis/Paul at least attempted to handle this privately. In most instances, players are willing to play out their contract because they don’t want to get fined into oblivion. Personally, I usually side with players on tirade requests as long as they keep going to work. No one is obligated to like their employment situation, but go to work if you’re under contract.  Additionally, teams are not obligated to trade a player. How the Sixers are handling this situation out Simmons is all in the CBA. Players can request trades all they want, but teams don’t have to honor it. More teams should call their player’s bluff. Like “Fine, we’ll look for a trade that works for us but until then go to work and don’t be a dick about it.” (i.e. sabotage games etc)"
"I struggle with it personally and I love DA. He was our most important player during the playoffs, he went toe to toe with Anthony Davis, made Jokic look silly in the Denver series, didn’t get played off the court against the Clips small ball and held it down as best he could against Giannis. BUT, offensively he still relies on being force fed which makes me nervous about his potential there. He almost averaged 20 in his rookie season so when he looks for his own shot he does make it look pretty easy but he’s limited to pretty basic stuff. If he could put the ball on the floor consistently I’d want him maxed ASAP, but without that I worry about it a little"
"I mean I don’t hate the Lakers.  I nothing the Lakers.  But this team is no where as good as the 2020 team.  That team had 2 way shooters.  This team has 1 way shooters.  If this team defends at a high level it’ll be because Anthony Davis is playing like the DPOY (which spoiler, he is my pick for that award this year).  In fact I think the Lakers make it out the West.  But that has nothing to do with how dumb everything you say sounds.  You just sound ignorant to anything about basketball outside of blind love for the Lakers.  Who frankly you don’t seem to know much about outside of looking at basic percentage stats."
"AD didn't refuse to play, but he did publicly demand a trade to the Lakers and attempted to tank his trade value by announcing he wouldn't sign an extension with any other suitor.   The NBA [fined him](https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-fined-trade-demand-nba-official-release) $50K for his ""intentional effort to undermine the contractual relationship"" with the Pelicans."
His trade value won't change and all it takes is two teams to bid against each other.  You take the Anthony Davis route.
"&gt; Why are people here struggling to understand that trade leverage can change over time.  Because it's not based in reality.   Every single instance of teams ""waiting for a better offer"" on a malcontent player has resulted in those teams either getting the exact same offer or worse.  On one side you have case studies such as:  * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * James Harden * Anthony Davis * Paul George * etc etc.  And on the other side of the debate we have case studies such as:  * N/A   ***  &gt; they have to wait until a team gets desperate.   There's also very little reality going on here too.  Historically, the market actually gets worse for sellers as the season progresses. [There's no real history of stars being sold at the deadline](https://ca.nba.com/news/revisiting-some-of-the-most-impactful-deals-at-the-nba-trade-deadline-since-the-year-2000/rk8sg9udnjt416rhzcbyald04) because the market is so grim that most teams looking to sell end up bailing early.  The trade deadline is a buyer's market and it's specifically a market for teams looking for cheap expiring contracts.    It's a terrible market to be selling a max player on a 4-year deal, because most of the league won't even be in a position to facilitate the trade.   One of the main reasons big trades happen in the offseason is because teams giving up big trade packages need all 3 of the draft, FA and buyout periods to restock their roster.    No, the Minnesota Timberwolves are not going to bring in 8 G-Leaguers to pad out their 7-man roster at the trade deadline, especially not if they're ""desperate"" to make the playoffs.     ***  The issue isn't everyone else not understanding. The issue is people mistaking desire for reality.   Just because you want something to happen doesn't mean it will.   &gt; put them in a better spot to win a championship  That ship has sailed.   Dame isn't available, and even if he was, there are other teams with better packages available."
"&gt;New Orleans Pelicans   Their GOAT: Anthony Davis   Other Teams' GOATs: Chris Paul (Clippers)  This one's also kind of weird, since CP3 should be the Pelicans GOAT and he also left the Pelicans to go to the Clippers"
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There’s no evidence that he’s good at his job when it doesn’t involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron’s. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel, even his client Zach lavine is unhappy with his pay. Rich Paul has only been able to use the “pay my guy or lebron might leave” move"
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There’s no evidence that he’s good at his job when it doesn’t involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron’s. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel"
And the same general approach has also gotten a lot of dudes paid way above what anybody thought they would get. See Tristan Thompson. He's got his way a lot too. See Anthony Davis. Y'all acting like he's still a bum off the street in a suit is way out of line.
"James harden literally played for Houston 24 hours before being traded.   Anthony Davis didn’t sit out, the Pelicans would not let him dress until the league forced them to let him play. He played 15/20 next games until the Pels shut him down again.   Neither of these are comparable to Ben."
That same logic would have applied to James Harden and Anthony Davis and any other player who has ever sat out
"He's played with dwade and Chris bosh and Anthony Davis and kyrie irving,LeBron has had an elite level coach for all of his rings and jordans competition wasn't worse than LeBron"
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Anthony Davis
The Lakers might not even make it through the playoffs with Anthony Day-to-Davis as their #2 star.
"It's not that Ayton does or doesn't deserve it.  It's that some team is going to offer him the max anyways in restricted free agency next year, you can't afford to lose him and you're going to match it anyways. I would have just given him the inevitable max he was always going to get right now.  The funny thing is honestly, Ayton outperformed his draft expectations in my eyes. He came in as a guy with all the tools, question being his defense and he answered a lot of that with his improvement on both ends. What did the Suns expect to happen, for him to transform into Anthony Davis and become a no brainer max player?  This dilemma was always coming from day one regarding this, draft a big man who isn't dominant defensively or some absolute offensive outlier like Jokic/KAT and you will be left thinking to yourself ""well does he really justify a max?"" Would have expected an insta-max even if it was controversial like with Jamal Murray and the Nuggets. I'm surprised that the Suns are backing down from their convictions at this point but then again.. Sarver.."
Joe Johnson  Anthony Davis  The rules say the Suns can match him in Restricted Free Agency. The reality is lowballing and making a player feel unwanted is not a smart way to run a team. We're on track for Ayton doing the same thing and telling Sarver not to match.
We don’t have Lebron James and Anthony Davis
"What time zone are you in? I'm in EST  Roughly how often do you browse r/nba? At a bare minimum 5-10 times a day. Since i work remotely as a product manager, probably around 15-20 times a day.  How long have you been a part of our community and why do you think you'd be a good addition to the mod team?  I would say heavily in the past 3-4 years. I think I’d be a good addition to the mod team because I have a great grasp of the culture of the community- from the timing of jokes to the trends in how the community is feeling, i think r/nba is one of the rarest subs out there that has such a great community sense, and is oftentimes more informative than National media like ESPN or FOX.  Moreover, the reason my karma is 7.0K is actually mainly just from one post I made in the r/sports sub about Dwight Howard not believing in protection 😂 (check it out), so I’d like to think i have a solid grasp on what can go viral/gain traction and understand trends of what makes a good comment in the community.  Is there anything you'd like to change about the subreddit?  I think having better setup with sponsorships or AMAs. I remember the Anthony davis thread was sudden and seemed ill prepared, which felt like such a missed opportunity when i saw it. I’d love to work with reps to help spearhead the whole engagement/partnerships side of the thread and engage with people who love the thread as much as i do (ie Simu Liu, who apparently reads r/nba everyday)  What is your favorite NBA memory?  Watching the Celtics win the 08 final. I remember being allowed to stay up past my bedtime and seeing Kobe and the Lakers lose, and Kevin Garnett tearing his Jersey and just screaming, and then actually going to the duck boats parade in person to see rondo just snag a ball and sign it so effortlessly. That was what got me to love watching basketball.  Do you have any particular skill set that could benefit our subreddit mod team (coding, graphic design, etc.)?  I’m a product manager at a large tech company so I think I could help with strategy/prioritization in any way, technical or non technical. I also have an engineering degree, so can code.  Are you familiar with python/PRAW?  I've used Python in undergraduate for about 5 years now. Ive done research in machine learning, and even have applied for a masters in computer science at Georgia Tech. Are you interested in helping mod the sub in discord?   Yes, but am more frequent on Reddit. If I were to mod the discord, I’d expect a time split of about 70:30 - 80:20 tbh."
Anthony Davis
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
It ok. I’ve had people here use these kinds of numbers to tell me the Lakers defense is better without Anthony Davis.
"And AD was measured 6' 10"". We are supposed to believe that they are only 1.5 inch apart. My answer? No way. And anybody who has eyes' answer is ""what the f they were smoking when measuring Lebron?  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/anthony-davis-lebron-james-carmelo-anthony-and-russell-westbrook-of-picture-id1235580943?s=2048x2048"
"How is this any different from the shit Kawhi, AD, and Dwight pulled? It's weird how Simmons is being raked for refusing to play but media was a-OK with Anthony Davis and Kawhi doing the same."
Considering MKG and Anthony Davis went to UK together and went 1-2 in the draft. It’s not that shocking one is younger than the other.
"McClung, LeBron, Anthony Davis, D Jordan, D Howard"
"Yeah and New Orleans has had 3 of them (Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, and now Zion). It’s by far the easiest. Minnesota (Karl Anthony Towns and Kevin Garnett), Orlando (Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Dwight Howard), etc all agree.  Getting that player is easy. Putting a championship roster around them is hard."
Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis. AD will be playing his 10th year of basketball while Buddy is only playing his 6th season.
"That's a very strong statement, no argument against it. Who's #5 then? I'd go with Jokic over anyone else just cause DAMN do I like watching him play!  I completely dismiss the whole ""healthy Kawhi is a top 5 player"" as well because, well, it's true, but it's also true he's been unhealthy the past 4 years now! So, sorry, but that's a complete hypothetical at this point. Healthy Anthony Davis might also be top 5. Healthy AD doesn't exist though does he?"
Anthony Davis is older than Steven Adams. AD still seems to me like a young guy coming into his prime while Adams has seemed like a vet presence for years
Anthony Davis is only 2 years older than Kyle Kuzma
Anthony Davis is a fraud. Dude was so bad he couldn't even stay on the court more than a quarter.
"Damian Lillard $5   Duncan Robinson $2   Cam Reddish $1   OG Anunoby $2    Anthony Davis $5     Pretty simple- if you are building for a championship window, you need to plan for playoff basketball.  Prioritizing a spread PnR with a stout defense and a dominant offensive engine guard and defensive anchor big.  The Lillard/AD two man game would be unstoppable, with shooters on the wing who can help without too many touches on offense, being pluses on the other end."
Eric Bledsoe  Donovan Mitchell Anthony Davis Jusuf Nurcic Talen Horton-Tucker  Mitchell and Davis get it done.  THT is underrated.  Bledsoe and Nurcic are gravy.
"A weird one that sticks out to me is that (from oldest to youngest) Malcolm Brogdon, Buddy Hield, Anthony Davis, and Bradley Beal are all 28 years old. Beal is the youngest of the four? And even moreso, Michael Kidd Gilchrist is younger than ALL OF THEM 😂"
"Still kind of surprising since they were drafted 4 years apart, but Mitchell just turned 25 while Giannis turns 27 in early December, so it's much closer to a full 2 years older than it is to 1 year older.   Damian Lillard being 3 years older than guys like Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal is something I find myself forgetting since they were all in the same draft class (Lillard was a 4-year college player while Davis and Beal were both one-and-done)."
Anthony Davis has to prove he can stay healthy
"All three of the most recent champions were built through trades. Bucks traded a ton of picks for Jrue Holiday, Lakers traded the roster for Anthony Davis, and Raptors traded for Kawhi..."
"Regular season games missed in the last five years and respective ages:  * Anthony Davis - 83 games missed, 28 years old  * Kawhi Leonard - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * Steph Curry - 115 games missed, 34 years old  * Joel Embiid - 131 games missed , 27 years old  * Kevin Durant - 147 games missed, 33 years old"
"Anthony ""Streetclothes"" Davis"
"Anthony Davis will get injured ten minutes into the season opener.  Andrew Wiggins will get vaxxed The nuggets will take brutal revenge on my Suns if we meet in the playoffs and Murray is back.  BKLN comes out of the east.  Zion will make the ASG again on a losing team again. Either Memphis or Charlotte will make the play-in  This will be Dames last season as a blazer after they blow it again.  MVP candidates in no order: Giannis, joker, KD, Steph, Bron, Trae, CP3, Embid"
anthony davis
"Big named centers not named Anthony Davis(Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Bam), Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Westbrook, and CJ McCollum  Center position is just a valuable position anymore. The rest are just players I don't think do well in playoff series on a championship team."
Barkley calling AD “Anthony street clothes Davis” had me dying last season
It's also one of Anthony Davis' nicknames.
Lmao sure the team with LeBron James and am Anthony Davis who was shooting way above his level was weak because they had Morris in their lineup. I'm not even a Lakers fan but they were good
"The only players capable of doing this are max level players, see Schroder for examples of mid level guys boning themselves going big brain- in this case Simmons has leverage.  I know people see this as a shitshow, but it’s actually being pumped in the news so much because it’s keeping NBA news alive in a lull moment in the dead of the offseason, and owners only care about their bottom line- max level players causing drama and investing multiple fanbases in an ongoing storyline that gets clicks across the board?  End of the day, this isn’t the first or last time a player flexes on a franchise, Vince Carter, Andrew Bynum, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, you could just keep listing names and situations.  Again, this does not hurt any of the owners profits, while owners care about their ability to steer their teams, they recognize that stars are holding more leverage in this era."
"Exactly this. I thought the 2017 Finals were closer than the 2020 finals, and that’s saying something. The only real blowouts for GSW was Game 1. Yet that was a comfortable 4-1 even though Games 3 and 5 was heavily in Cleveland’s favour before the fourth and third quarter respectively.   I’ll never forget Durant fouling LeBron with the Cavs up 8, where Durant would have had to sit for the half with his third (but it wasn’t called).   In 2020, the Lakers smoked them so bad that the debate wasn’t about the series through two games, it was about if Anthony Davis winning FMVP hurts LeBron’s legacy lmfao. Games 3-5 were all closely competitive, and Game 6 was a wash 6 minutes in."
And a quarter of Anthony Davis
"oh yeah, the team with LeBron and Anthony Davis on it, sure"
"Draymond, Anthony Davis"
"""The only reason [Anthony Davis] would go down like that is because he was pushed"" - about the played that is always on the ground and has the nickname street clothes because of how soft he is."
This is why it’s so easy to hate Anthony Davis
Anthony Toe Tap Davis
Anthony “Trevon Diggs” Davis
"In a game with Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and Carmelo Anthony  Ja Morant is the best player on the floor by far."
Pau Gasol and Drayomond Green over Anthony Davis is ridiculous.   You think if the 2015-2019 Warriros had swapped Draymond for AD they'd be worse??? Lmao you think the Pelicans led by Dray he would have averaged 30/13/5 and finished runner up for MVP?  I don't know how anyone with eyes who watched the NBA over the last 10 years could ever come to the conclusion that guys like Dray are better than AD.
Dude looks like he could be better than Anthony Davis in three years
"Lakers had lead at end of the first quarter in both games we've lost so far.   Lakers losing isn't because of the starting lineup. And the same lineup being trotted out at the start of the third is only like -3 and hadn't been the lineup that had given up the lead.  Anthony Davis playing Center has been much worse than yall are acting like it would be. Lots of variables and factors and the large deficit is probably not directly his fault, but it definitely hasn't been the big ass advantage yall keep saying it will be."
Anthony Davis would destroy Steven Adams but no
"Been a Hornets fan since they were the Bobcats, some 14 or 15 years now. Watched the Raymond Felton, Gerald Wallace, Emeka Okafor and Stephen Jackson team that got to the playoffs for the first time and got swept by Orlando. Watched the lockout team that had the worst winning percentage in history. Watched us lose the lottery for Anthony Davis and end up with MKG. Watched us lose to the Heat in seven only to never get close again.   This is by far the most excited I've been for this team (not that that's a big bar to clear, but still!)."
"no doubt rich paul told bron he was on the case.  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/6/15/22533517/rich-paul-explained-anthony-davis-trade-demand-lakers-right-team-new-yorker-story  &gt;I asked him about his early conversations with Davis about leaving New Orleans. He grew circumspect. “I educated him on why I thought the team wouldn’t be . . . ” He paused. “All athletes are competitive and confident, until reality sets in. And I educated him on things.”  ¬_¬"
"I’m expecting perimeter defenders to not get beat at the rate they were getting beat in that series. That level of defensive incompetence is inexcusable.   The exact same thing didn’t happen with Houston at all. When Houston matched up against Utah they still had Capela. They rarely ran 5 out. Gobert did underperform against Houston, but that’s cause Harden and chris Paul would constantly target him 1v1. No Centre save for maybe Anthony Davis and bam Adebayo are handling that. Again you could either blame harden for being so good, or blame the Jazz perimeter defenders/ defensive schemes for allowing switches to be forced so easily, but you can’t blame a 7 foot rim protection specialist for not being able to guard an MVP guard in isolation.   And no it’s literally not that. When he was guarding the 3 point shooters like Morris and Batum, he was handling them just fine. Because they were playing as catch and shoot players. They were easy to defend. The issues came when Gobert had to help inside. Again what exactly do you expect in those scenarios ? You’re either asking Gobert to be in two places at once, or you blame his team mates for allowing the blow-by. There aren’t other options.   You’re just showing how much you’re running with the narrative and not actually paying attention to what’s happening with Gobert by comparing Houston and LAC, which were completely different issues for Gobert"
Anthony Davis
He looked raw during preseason too and I was ready to temper my expectations and wait through this year.  NAH WE NOT DOING THAT ANY MORE he’s already better than Anthony Davis????
Very true. Can’t argue with that. They don’t call him Anthony day-to-Davis for no reason lmaooo
What ben Simmons is doing isn’t player empowerment nor James harden.   Anthony Davis had a year left on his contract and the org turned down several trades out of spite for him. Plus all GM’s said they’d rather he demand a trade
"I think I can officially say I’m not a fan of Anthony Davis, looks like he’s in the wrong here. Doesn’t seem like a guy who is quick to take accountability for things."
Anthony Davis lite. Amazing pick by the Cavs.
"If Anthony Davis is, then so is Klay."
Everyone there knew Howard would have put Anthony “street clothes” Davis on injured reserve. He’s soft.
"Except we have Anthony Davis. I know people are down on him currently, but he's a superstar, an ideal fit next to Lebron, and proven in the playoffs. Obviously there are injury concerns, but you can't just straight up ignore him. The second best player on that Cavs team was, who, a washed Kevin Love? George Hill?"
"Don't talk to loud, the vibrations might tear Anthony Davis' groin."
"When Top 75 players of all time like Anthony Davis can't consistently lead their team into the playoffs as the guy, playing with NBA champions like Jrue Holiday, who is Jimmy Butler to be criticized for one really bad playoff series when he's never been on a sub .500 team, even when playing with questionable rosters?"
“Anthony Davis has been assessed 15 technical fouls for assaulting the entire Memphis bench”
nothing. divas like anthony davis and westbrook have ruined all team chemistry and good vibes on their team. expect things to get worse before they get better.
Well Anthony Davis didn’t really hit Dwight Howard so it was slug-ish.
"He also was really good toward the end of the 2015 season in New Orleans. Holiday was out and instead of them putting him at SF like they stupidly liked to do, they put him at PG instead. He played great in his natural role and him and Anthony Davis helped them get the 8 seed in the playoffs."
But neither is Russell Westbrook and Anthony Davis tbh.
Anthony Davis is here long term..
One could say Anthony Davis felt . . . Ruffled.
"David Robinson, Kevin Garnett, Anthony Davis, LeBron James."
Anthony Davis.
"Absolutely not, they have LeBron James and Anthony Davis on their team.  The fact that they even traded for Westbrook in the first place was absolutely dumb."
&gt; He plays with LeBron  This one especially. OP acts like Pelicans Anthony Davis never happened.
Oh no Anthony Davis is difficult to work with who could have seen this coming
Anthony Davis
"Nate Archibald, Dave Cowens, Billy Cunningham, Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, Robert Parish, Bill Sharman, Wes Unseld, Lenny Wilkens.  Do you think they all deserve a spot over Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard or Klay Thompson?"
"Not sure what you’re asking or even implying. Your first question seems to support the argument then everything else seems to try to refute it by giving examples of role players with niche roles excelling on LBJ teams.  That’s the standout feature of LBJs teams. Alternate star power is suppressed; role players are elevated. Happens not even with bright rookies, but with established players. Bosh, Wade, Love, Kyrie, etc.  Conversely, among top players and picks there are many great young players in the league that have become championship or all star caliber players by age 23-25.  Anthony Davis. Giannis. Jokic. Tatum. JB. Etc. highly unlikely — though we’ll never know; it’s a counterfactual world — that these guys never see that degree of success playing alongside LBJ as a rookie."
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
Anthony Davis is still on a championship hangover and it’s hurting them
"I'm old enough to have watched those 90s players play and by every measure of an eye test Anthony Davis is the far superior basketball player to Ray, Pippen and Payton. Even just watching him at Kentucky he was clearly a generational talent.  Bulls would have went like 79-3 with Anthony Davis and Jordan are you kidding. Only players from that era that would be clearly better than AD today are MJ, Hakeem, and maybe Robinson.   In terms of basketball skills and impact watching  AD is closer to Kevin Garnett than anyone else. Now KG had more hardware and should be ranked comfortably ahead for sure. But I'm definitely putting AD pretty high on the list of players who never won an MVP and definitely over consistently great but never MVP level players like Payton, Ray, Reggie, Pip, Stockton, etc."
"The thing is, stats are incredibly inflated these days. Its hard to base things on stats, rather the eye test is the best way to go. Davis hardly plays, and when he does hes a regular star big. Nothing spectacular, but no doubt a star. He for sure doesnt belong over pippen or ray. Payton the glove was one of the greatest distributors, defensive guards.   Anthony juat doesnt have enough or even played enough when it matters."
"Davis is easily top 75 all time. Probably top 50 of all time. Mind boggling how people don't think he belongs on that list.  He has better stats and career accomplishments than guys like Reggie, Ray, Pippen, Elvin Hayes, Gary Payton, Drexler, Pistol Pete. Tons of guys from the 60s and 70s.  There's a very short list of players in history where swapping with prime Anthony Davis would make their team worse."
Doesn’t make it okay for Anthony Davis to put his hands on him
Looks like Anthony Davis is pinching Howard's nipple and telling him whistle!!
Honestly they are pretty close and Anthony Davis didn’t have to get his pedophilia swept under the rug so that makes it an easy win for AD.    With him and Malone you’d have too many top 75 players fucking underage girls.
Anthony Davis is a lot better than cp3
imagine getting in your feelings over an AMA on reddit 😭 “leave anthony davis alone!”
"I feel like if your team has LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and you start to wonder “do we need to build this team after someone else,” then something is wrong"
If you’re Anthony Davis why even acknowledge his presence?
Especially when you have Anthony Davis and Carmelo Anthony. The announcers used Anthony for each at separate times.
"Anthony ""Zach Randolph"" Davis"
Anthony Davis is soft as baby shit.

Anthony Davis had never been close to as talented as prime Dwight Howard.
Let’s see em do it with Anthony Davis on the court
""" Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard get into a tickle fight on the sidelines, Howard seizes"""
"Dwight better be careful. He might hurt Anthony ""The Locker Room"" Davis"
there are people in the original list that should be taken off way before anthony davis.  AD becomes so underrated lmao
Should be Anthony Davis starting a altercation
"Anthony ""I can't let you get close"" Davis"
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
LeBron is turning 37 and the foreseeable future of the Lakers depends on Anthony Davis. Disappointing leadership and an immature way of handling disputes demonstrated thus far. AD just had to confront his teammate aggressively and make a scene in public in front of all those audiences in the Staples Center and in front of the televisions.
"did Dwight Howard make a ""pass"" at Anthony Davis ?"
What does Anthony Davis have to be frustrated about anyway?
Totally unacceptable. I love Anthony Davis.
Anthony Day to Davis
"The special treatment is what gets on my nerves. Sure, they won the bubble Finals, but his other two seasons there have been very disappointing, and there's always a million other things people point to before his effort in games. As people have pointed out in the comments, he was even doing this in the Phoenix playoff series last year when they were missing Anthony Davis. There's no excuse for that.  I usually wouldn't argue so much about this, but the lack of effort that's just getting more and more common with him is annoying. We're only 2 games into the season, can't blame fatigue yet."
No because Anthony Davis is at worst a top 8 nba player.
"Anthony Davis had a turnover which lead to Suns fast break 3. In the meantime, Davis and Ayton didn't cross half court, got into it, and both received double techs."
"Also, he doesn’t dress himself.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-davis-defends-thats-all-folks-shirt-says-he-has-no-control-over-what-he-wears/"
Ok the Anthony Davis chips are literally the fucking best though. I will die on this hill.
Anthony Davis is now out 4 weeks with a wrist injury
"If that 4th quarter wasn't enough evidence for the Lakers to move Anthony Davis to the 5 permanently and just let Westbrook play then idk what to tell you. Give the backup minutes at center to Dwight, DJ shouldn't play unless one of Davis/Howard is injured. Maybe even start the rookie. Lebron can have the ball in his hands the last five minutes of the game."
AD only averaged almost 28/10 in the playoffs on a title winning team with 57/38/83 splits in the same season he was 2nd in DPOY voting. Are you honestly trying to say Green is better than Davis??? I think Green was always underrated but better than ANTHONY DAVIS?
you're right anthony davis is not a good player because of this game
"Oh, I have no idea what he actually said. It’s very possible he did say don’t talk to me like that or something. Whatever was said I don’t think it was Dwight trying to defuse the situation. Anthony Davis certainly initiated from everything I’ve seen and it’s possible Dwight was just sticking up for himself and Davis was being a dick. Idk. But it didn’t look like Dwight stood up just to calm Davis down."
Tried so hard to get that triple double especially with that last assist. Westbrook tried to steal a rebound from Anthony Davis. It’s hilarious.
Should trade Anthony Davis to Miami so they don’t have to share a locker room and have all this tension stressing them out.
"LeBron being your team’s best shooter isn’t going to cut it. Also at one point the Lakers were outscored 48-6 in the paint with Anthony Davis, LeBron James &amp; Russell Westbrook. If this team isn’t going to play any defense they have to outscore teams ffs."
"Dwight is also an 8 times all star, and 8 times all nba, 2 times blocks leader, 5 times rebounding leader, 5 time all defense (compared to 4 times for Anthony davis), also a champion and on top of all that has three consecutive dpoys."
My ass is anthony davis top75 lol
Chris Paul's left nut is more competitive than all of Anthony Davis
Suns ain’t winning tonight if LeBron was healthy and Anthony Davis was playing
Anthony Davis
I’m gonna go ahead and say it. Dwight is a saint and Anthony davis can get fucked.
Anthony Davis been acting a whole ass tonight. Dude needs a Snickers.
cause he'd choke out Anthony Davis
anthony davis has no business being anywhere near top 75
No more fucking mid range shots from Anthony Davis. Ever.
Anthony Davis is the aggressor here and Dwight's gonna beat his soft ass 😂
Anthony Davis starring in… **The Dwightmare Before Christmas**.
"When Anthony ""less made threes than Giannis"" Davis is your best 3 pt shooter you have a big problem"
Does anybody want the shit on their team other then Anthony Davis or Lebron
"Obviously Anthony Davis, don't think anyone would argue otherwise"
I’m still not convinced Anthony Davis is a superstar never have been
"Anthony ""Andre Drummond"" Davis with that statline"
Clippers need a contender level Bigman if they want a ring.      The top teams have:  \- Anthony Davis  \- Jokic  \- Embiid  \- Giannis     What will Zubac or old/injured Ibaka do? Going small won't work. Time to trade for a better Bigman.

"Perkins, LOL!

"Yea it wasn't just his height and length that made him so dangerous. The guy legit moved like a 6'10 shooting guard. Not hyperbole like a lot of players. You know, like when they say Ben Simmons has guard skills or Anthony Davis has guard skills. KD legit had the first step, footwork and shooting ability of an elite guard."
"It really hasn't been a slippery slope. Most of the issue is due to unprofessional management.   When Anthony Davis let it be known he wasn't going to re-sign in free agency and requested a trade, the Pelicans should've been grateful AD did them the kindness of letting them know with plenty of time left on his contract so they could work out a deal where both parties came out ahead. Instead Dell Demps decided to throw a tantrum and ultimately got fired because of it.   Kawhi let the spurs know and Pop threw a tantrum too. They ultimately got a couple of years of Derozan Instead of Brandon Ingram long term because of Pop's lack of professionalism.   The Rockets let James Harden's teammate walk in free agency or traded them away, they let his coach go, his GM go, and were surprised when James Harden didn't want to have a 50% usage rate as a 32 year old. You can't drain all the life out of a player and complain he's playing lifelessly.   I would argue Simmons is the only guy here that's behaving unprofessionally. Simmons isn't fully at fault here either. Why did Doc have to air our dirty laundry by saying he wasn't sure if Simmons was a championship caliber PG? You're not under oath, a-hole. Just fucking lie. ""Ben Simmons is the greatest PG to have ever walk the earth."" How hard is that? Tell him to fix face he's gotta switch positions, but don't do that shit in public. And why didn't Morey trade him? Dude's been in every possible trade rumor since Morey took over. At some point you gotta just deal the guy. This is what happens when it's both parties that behave unprofessionally. Usually, it's only the front offices, so it typically doesn't get this messy."
"Zion - when healthy.  That combination of size, strength and speed.  Anthony Davis - A near 7 footer with strength yet also the agility, speed of a guard/forward.  Ant - A big and strong 6""6 (grew 2 inches according to finch) and jumps out of the gym."
"Towns scores on only 30% of his post possessions, and is only fouls on 6.7% of possessions. The only player to be fouled less is Anthony Davis at 5.6%."
"Lmao. Just look at the list bro. You can’t just look at the top 5 exclude everyone you don’t like and just go  “Well that looks alright”  The list a fucking mess of weird shit. Brandon Davis is ranked above KD who is somehow ranked 21. Jrue Holiday is ranked over Nash, Kidd, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis.  You know who else is ranked over Davis? Nene. Fucking Nene is ranked above Anthony Davis.  And that’s just with a click glance at the top 30."
"I mean it's enough people to destroy a cool chance to have an AMA with Anthony Davis as an example. We all say how inspiring DeRozans and Loves comments on mental health but if it comes down to Simmons or Irving, mental health is somehow not that important anymore. This subs favorite joke is Barkley calling some random female entity fat and ugly...sorry I just wish to read all these insightful comments when it comes down to a player having a hard time."
Anthony Davis? Usman Garuba?
Giannis and Anthony Davis aren't centers so they aren't on that part of this list. Also you got to be smoking crack if you think Brook Lopez is on Aytons level at this point in his career.    This isn't some crack pot idea. Look at any top 10 center list Ayton is either 6 or 7.
Anthony Davis is the main one keeping the team above .500 my guy
"Part of it is that the salary cap, guaranteed salaries, and salary matching requirements for NBA trades basically mean there will ALWAYS be players moving on both sides of a trade. Not necessarily true for MLB or NFL. Since that's the floor of the trade, you start seeing picks get tacked on in order to make the side trading away the ""better"" player(s) feel like it's balanced.   The Lakers needed multiple players on smaller contracts to match Westbrook's contract, and since Washington had the leverage in that situation (and was perceived as getting three nickles for their quarter), picks were tossed in.  Add to that, the ability of one elite player to change a team in the NBA where rosters are smaller and fewer players are on the court versus the other two where teams are larger and there are more active players on any given night. So going all in for someone that can dramatically change your scheme and your success rate (like Jrue Holiday or Anthony Davis) is a smaller gamble."
"""Medical advancements"" made 37 year old Melo more durable than 28 year old Anthony Davis?"
"Anthony Davis who is always hurt, and even when healthy is clearly no longer the player he was a couple years ago.  And THT who is a pink elephant that Laker fans think is going to be magically useful despite...never actually being so?  But yes, the Lakers have been able to rely on the crutch of their geography for the last 20 years despite the fact that management has run the team into the ground only to be saved by free agents and under-contract players and their agents pushing to play in Hollywood.  The swap likely won't be used, but the first will be.  But they still have 3 firsts and 2 swaps from the Bucks, including mulitple ones after the Giannis contract ends.  ""lol, Pels"" whatever, but the Pelicans have tons of firsts, youth, and good contracts to trade.  Whoever is running this team in the offseason will have assets and the flexibility to trade for a 3rd star"
"Isn’t it just a pick swap and a first at this point? Also “aging Lakers” is dumb. Everyone in the league ages.   Your remaining Laker picks are tied to a Lakers “team” that is Anthony Davis, Talen Horton Tucker, and $90 million in cap space.   Taking advantage of a pick swap seems unlikely.   Not trying to be hostile."
I know youre a Lakers fan but he's missed 10+ games the past 3 seasons and limped his way to that title 2 years ago.   Im not sure how glued you are to ADs career but it's moving in the wrong direction especially when you have a report like this:  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries
"I wonder if this year’s lakers team is one of the best “if everyone was in their primes” teams ever?  Prime Lebron, Melo, Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Rondo, DeAndre Jordan as a backup center  There are some fit issues but the talent of that team would be insane"
JJ Is Full of crap. We traded holiday because we were starting to rebuild and he has been loyal to the organization and a good player so we treated him to what he wanted to go. Lonzo ball play like shit for the Pelicans. We put good teams around Anthony Davis we had a lot of injuries and Anthony Davis was always hurt. Also Anthony Davis could never close games. Also when we had DeMarcus Cousins he injured himself and was never the same. This year the pelicans have a ton of injuries. I hate when people who don’t watch the Pelicans or follow the organization always have a stupid opinion to give

The traitor Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis does not exist
One day Anthony Davis will realize he can’t shoot the 3
ESPN: “Anthony Davis says teammate Russell Westbrook acts without ‘conscience’ and tends to ‘miss 20 in a row’…”  SAS: “It’s time to face facts: the Lakers have to trade AD for CJ McCollum and accept that this season is for the Warriors to win.”
"They've been awful all game, but they're clearly favoring the Lakers lmao.  Anthony Davis should have at least 3 more fouls than he does, he's hacked Bam across the arms multiple times."
Bam abusing everyone not named Anthony Davis
"To be fair, lebron and Anthony Davis basically made them. I have no idea how lebron, having been so fucking in sync with Caruso and having personally not guarded Westbrook in the playoffs, decided that he needed Russ. It’ll never make sense to me."
Except two players are completely unproven and never have shown any capabilities to perform at this level yet.... And the other guy was the second best player on a championship team and scored 39 points with Anthony Davis checking him last year before he had to sit the season due to an injury.    Don't act like a clown.
Anthony Davis and low cut Kobes = what could go wrong...
Lakers are a low IQ team. Westbrook is a straight up 0 and Anthony Davis wants to be Steph Curry so bad and since winning the championship hasn't since the inside of a gym aside game day.
"It's good to some extent.  It's also really foolish.  Any player who cares about their legacy or future would take a pay cut to play on a stacked team, but most of them want the immediate payout (reasonable, career ending injuries are possible) and to be the star (reasonable again, more money for being a star than not).  I mean imagine Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron, and Anthony Davis and Giannis or Jokic all on the same team.  Analytics are way more relevant to baseball though, because 9 players performing marginally better per dollar adds up a lot more than in basketball, not to mention baseball is hardly a team spot the way basketball is."
"I  checked this out on bball ref, and it's unfortunately a little messy to analyze from their platform. Filtering out non-qualifiers leaves out some key guys like Anthony Davis because of injuries either last year or this, but opening it up to all and doing per 36 brings absolute legends such as Nathan Knight and Eugene Omoruyi to the top of the list. So I'm doing some filtering in Excel and will bring any good findings back."
Karl Anthony-Davis
"Joe's Harris shot 47.4% from 3 that year. Closest player to that KAT has ever had is Beasley, who he's hardly played with yet.   Dinwiddie averaged 16 ppg on above average efficiency. Backup or not, still a legit NBA player. Not some scrub.   Allen and Davis both very strong rebounders and good presence at the rim on defense, as well as great lob threats. Davis had a 25% rebound %, which is nuts. Embiids highest for a season was 22%.   Levert, don't really need to jump into that. Good scorer.   My point here, being, Russell had good players to play with all at once that year. Towns, hasn't had that except that one year, and surprise! He made the playoffs.   Towns has maybe played with guys as good as the ones I've listed, but never at the same time. A lot of his career he's had to play with guys like Treveon Graham, Culver, Wiggins, Teague, Shabazz Mohammed, Kris Dunn, Jerryd Bayless, Anthony Tolliver, Juancho Hernangomez, and a bunch of other rookies, sophomores, or dudes who aren't in the league anymore."
"Anthony Davis, if he plays at this level for 2-4 more years will be very much deserving of a spot. AD right now doesn't even come close.  You compare him to Paul Pierce, and I know you said it was close but it really isn't. Pierce at 23 was the leader of a team that made the ECF with only one other player scoring double digits. Davis at the same age had made it to playoffs once with a comparable roster and got swept in the first.  You can argue that Anthony Davis is the better player than Pierce, and I'd actually totally agree with you, but he's still got some work to do to become 'greater' than a lot of guys. Davis still needs to shed some of the reputation from NOLA, and his health is working against him."
"Full article:  ON A QUIET evening a few weeks before the start of the regular season, Wilson Taylor was deep inside Paycom Center's laundry room, which doubles as the Oklahoma City Thunder equipment manager's deep storage facility. At a rack pushed up against the wall, he ran his hands over a layer of dust on a cluster of black and gold Nike shoe boxes. Kobe 8 System TB, size 13.5.  He smiled, knowing the score he'd just uncovered. He pulled out his phone, took a picture and texted it to Thunder rookie guard Josh Giddey.  ""No way!"" Giddey wrote back. ""Can I come right now?""  Fifteen minutes later Giddey was in the building, cracking open the five pairs of orange-and-white Thunder-color Kobes that had originally been sent for Derek Fisher, who finished his playing career with the Thunder in the 2013-14 season and had previously been a longtime teammate of Kobe Bryant. Giddey, cradling the boxes like a child on Christmas, looked at Taylor and said: ""Can I have them all?""  For years, this might've seemed like an unusual request. In the world of excess and fashion celebrity that is the NBA, shoes are usually ubiquitous. They're always fresh, always everywhere and typically gratis.  Until now.  Last spring, Nike and Vanessa Bryant announced they were parting ways after the shoe giant's deal with the late Kobe Bryant ended. The sides are still talking with the hope they can eventually come to terms, sources told ESPN, but currently the partnership is off. There had already been production delays that prevented players from getting their normal supply during the 2020-21 season, and for now, there are no more Kobes being produced.  Suddenly, the most popular sneaker among NBA players is also the hardest to get.  ""If you don't already have them,"" says Portland Trail Blazers forward Larry Nance, ""you're not getting them.""  KOBE BRYANT'S SIGNATURE Nike sneaker had become unquestionably the most popular shoe for NBA players in recent years. During the 2019-20 season, more than 100 players were wearing the Kobe 4 Protro, a retro re-release of a sneaker Bryant originally wore in 2008. Today's players love the design, the feel and the statement of the Kobes.  ""This generation looks at Kobe like our Jordan,"" says Chicago Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan, known in the league as the dean of the Kobe shoe devotees. ""It's a great shoe to wear. Guys really fell in love with it.""  In the Orlando bubble in 2020, just months after Bryant's tragic death, nearly one-third of the 330 or so players were wearing a version of Kobe's signature shoe, and that figure was growing. Over the past two years, a number of players who'd previously been with Under Armour and Adidas did not have their sneaker endorsement contracts renewed, a trend that was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the new sneaker free agents went looking for Kobes. It all adds up to a large contingent of players who now have a source problem for their Kobe needs.  There are still supplies on sale at some retailers, but not in great numbers in the sizes NBA players typically need. The scarcity of larger sizes has driven a pricing boom on secondary shoe resale websites such as StockX, GOAT and eBay.  NBA players who wear size 14 or larger are looking at spending at least $800 for the most basic models of Kobes, and that's not what they typically wear. But the players are paying, with several telling ESPN they've spent more than five figures buying supplies of Kobes on the secondary market since last spring and summer.  ""I'm not going into a store and finding a [size] 17 in a Kobe. No way,"" says Anthony Davis, who switched to the Kobes when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. ""I mean, it's guys' favorite shoes. ... A lot of people are inspired by him, and the shoe feels amazing. All of them feel amazing.""  Players previously used to wearing whatever colors they wanted -- particularly after the league relaxed its rules around sneakers before the 2018-19 season -- are now scouring the web and trying to hunt forgotten stockpiles to get shoes to wear in games. And they're competing against each other for the available large sizes in the marketplace.  ""If you weren't in on them for the last few years,"" says DeRozan, a longtime Kobe model enthusiast, ""you're having a tough time.""  Kobes are now considered ""deadstock,"" taking them into a vintage market that ups the ante. NBA players have chased deadstock shoes for years, often to add to their collections to wear or display off the court. Miami Heat forward P.J. Tucker is known for wearing high-end vintage models in games, but he's an outlier.  It's also not unheard of for players to occasionally buy shoes for game usage. Taylor says he sometimes helped players such as former Thunder center Steven Adams, who wears size 19 and really liked the way Derrick Rose's older Adidas models fit him, spend a few hundred dollars to chase down extra pairs. More commonly around the league, players wear what they're paid to wear and there's almost never a thought about supply.  The current situation around Kobes is a whole new game, even for players paid to wear Nikes. Giddey, who signed a multiyear deal with Nike before the season, and players like him are spending more than $1,500 on pairs of Kobes right now as they try to stock up for this season and beyond. Their agents are sniffing around for them, calling in favors and hunting the secondary market for their clients, but without much success.  ""I've had a few guys reach out to me for help,"" says Phoenix Suns star Devin Booker said. ""I'll never run out of Kobes."" Booker and DeRozan have a supply of PEs, shorthand for Player Exclusives, that Nike has set them up with as brand ambassadors for years. But they're in an elite class. The shortage is particularly hitting young players who adore Bryant and his shoe line but haven't had the benefit of being in the league long enough to create a backlog.  ""I'm working on it every day,"" says New Orleans Pelicans rookie Trey Murphy, who wore a pair of Kobes gifted to him by a teammate to start the season. ""It's hard out there right now. I'm not DeMar DeRozan.""  But even DeRozan can't be DeRozan.  ""I used to play in a pair once or twice and then give my shoes away to fans,"" DeRozan says. ""I may not be able to do that as much.""  THE RUMORS OF the end of the Bryant family agreement with Nike started circulating last season before becoming official in April. Nike reps quietly told team equipment managers to prepare their Kobe guys for an end.  ""Some of us got the word, and we started hoarding them,"" says Suns forward Jae Crowder. ""By the time the news came out, I had banked up enough for about two years.""  Stars with major shoe deals like LeBron James, who has given molds of his feet to Nike so custom shoes feel broken in on first wear, break out a new pair each game. Some players will wear them for a couple of games. Crowder says his two-year supply was 100 pairs, as he usually goes through about 50 in a year. Davis, on the other hand, uses fewer, as he says he will use around 20-25 pairs of his relatively shallow Kobe supply this season. Some players without a similarly deep supply have already been forced to switch. Several equipment managers say players have switched this season to the plentiful Nike Kyrie Irving Low model, which has design similarities to the Kobe model. Others are using Nike's new more generic line, the GT. But many custom shoes have been delayed as Nike and other shoe retailers deal with factory shutdowns in Asia due to COVID-19.  In the meantime, the players who still have Kobes are trying to get the most out of each box.  ""The guys I have wearing Kobes are wearing them until they damn near fall apart,"" one equipment manager says.  When discussing this situation with ESPN, players repeatedly expressed hope that Nike and the Bryant estate can come to a new agreement, a talking point that's been pervasive among sneakerheads this fall. But even if that comes to pass, it would be a long time before Kobes are available again -- to players or anyone else. Product lines typically take Nike 12-16 months to produce, sources say, and that was before the pandemic disrupted global supply chains.  Either way, as this season rolls on and the supplies of the remaining Kobes begin to dwindle with no replacements, the demand for the late Hall of Famer's beloved shoe design will only increase. In a time when some players are dabbling in cryptocurrency investments, there might be a new exchange developing as more players get desperate.  ""I've always had so many pairs, but I'm looking at them differently now. Guys are asking me [for them], but I can't go through them like I did,"" DeRozan says. ""If it gets bad, I may have to even go to my secret vault.""  ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this story."
"I still think moving on from KAT may be the best answer, I'm not really sure. I just think he is criminally underrated simply for being a Timberwolf so I want to defend him. Plenty of great players struggled until getting paired with a superstar and a good supporting cast. Bosh, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Booker, etc.  There are only so many Lebrons and KDs. Even for them, basketball is a team sport no matter how much we focus on individuals."
Anthony Davis is actually good and deserves to be top-75 all-time.  I’l go one step further and bet anyone that you can’t name 76 dudes who deserve it more.
Anthony Davis
Dale Davis and Anthony Davis when they were pacers …..more so dale Davis
"Man what the fuck happened to Anthony Davis?  There's no reason for him to decline as much as he has, he still puts up stats but his impact on the game is no longer even close to the same level it used to be."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"the pelicans  were also trying to compete. They had Anthony Davis and signed a pre injury demarcus cousins, and they actually looked pretty good when all three were on the floor. It’s a shame that AD is injury prone and demarcus’s career got derailed with injuries. They were looking promising before that. Pelicans made waves with how Jrue and AD tore apart the blazers in the playoffs."
"Zion only playing 85 games in three years is rough.  And it does remind of Anthony Davis. AD was constantly hurt and he's still constantly hurt as a Laker. It's really hard to win games when you can't stay on the floor. It's hard to build around that. *(Their families are quite similar too...)*  I also wish our team hadn't hired David Griffin because that guy really blew an amazing start with the first pick, the fourth pick, and future picks. I don't get how we're into our third coach in year three or a whole new roster every season as David Griffin keeps not getting it right...  I'm definitely jealous of Memphis and their ability to build out a good roster around Ja and be competitive. And they have a guy who seems genuinely invested in their city and their team.  We were given way more to start than them (and an awesome all-star wing to play along with our pick!) and it just always seems on the verge of falling apart."
yeah idk why i expect normal behavior from people who asked if Anthony Davis scissored with Lebron on an AMA
Don’t be a clown. Ever been to Chicago? Ask about Anthony Davis’ &amp; the 4 Corner Hustlers. But I’m sure the internets is about as dangerous as you get.
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
"LOOOL the only reason your team made it out of the first round were injuries. The Suns had one of the luckiest runs to the Finals in modern NBA history. Every single opponent they faced had either their best or second best player injured (or both lol).   LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and Jamal Murray all missed part or the entirety of their series against the Suns. Even with that luck, Phoenix *still* couldn’t win the championship."
"I can’t stand watching Anthony Davis. Probably partly because lakers, but he’s always falling down for no reason and getting every foul call"
"Charles Oakley, Antonio Davis, Moses Malone, Ron Arrest, Xavier McDaniel, Anthony Mason, Dennis Rodman, Robert Parish, Zac Randolph, Kenyon Martin, Dale Davis, Mookie Blalock"
Dwight should have been there over Anthony fuckiNG Davis LOL
"He really only had a 5-6 year stretch of being an elite player.  From 07-11 he was a top tier player in the league, then he got injured in 12 and things declined from there.  On the Lakers/Rockets he still put up good numbers but he was nowhere near what he was in terms of impact like in Orlando, and then he spent years putting up numbers that looked good while moving from team to team cause they didn't want him.  The two people that people say Dwight should've been over are Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.  Davis misses 15-20 games a year usually due to injuries but his numbers and impact on the team have been much better than peak Dwight, and Lillard's been one of the best scorers in the league for a long while, and very likely will remain an elite scorer.  AD over Dwight no question, and Dame/Dwight is honestly a toss-up, and Dwight's personality driving him off of multiple teams is enough of an X-factor against him in the toss-up"
"The thing is that the Lakers have plenty of three point and midrange options. Unexpectedly Carmelo is playing some of his best basketball in years and is a proven spot up shooter. Lebron has evolved into a great spot up shooter, Anthony Davis has range etc.   What is killing the Lakers right now is turnovers and bad decisions which are out of sync with the team. One of Simmons biggest strengths is being a pass-first guy isn't necessarily a bad thing on a team where he is surrounded by willing shooters and scorers.  Again, its unlikely to happen because I am sure the way things have played out with Ben  that Lebron likely isn't wanting to bring the drama train to LA despite being tight with Klutch Sports and Simmons."
"Forgot to add, here's a longer version of the first table with the 50 biggest connections. I think Tim Duncan/ Tony Parker are the only pair that show up on both sides of this:  | Shooter | Assister | Number of assists | |:------:|:------:|:------:| | Karl Malone | John Stockton | 1572 | | Tim Duncan | Tony Parker | 1533 | | Kevin Durant | Russell Westbrook | 1466 | | Blake Griffin | Chris Paul | 1157 | | Amar'e Stoudemire | Steve Nash | 1155 | | Marc Gasol | Mike Conley | 1121 | | David West | Chris Paul | 1120 | | Klay Thompson | Stephen Curry | 962 | | Richard Hamilton | Chauncey Billups | 934 | | Richard Jefferson | Jason Kidd | 890 | | Kevin Garnett | Rajon Rondo | 878 | | Carlos Boozer | Deron Williams | 834 | | Shawn Marion | Steve Nash | 823 | | Allen Iverson | Eric Snow | 812 | | Steven Adams | Russell Westbrook | 809 | | Bradley Beal | John Wall | 797 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Steve Nash | 797 | | Antawn Jamison | Gilbert Arenas | 790 | | Ray Allen | Rajon Rondo | 787 | | Zydrunas Ilgauskas | LeBron James | 785 | | Stephen Curry | Draymond Green | 776 | | Serge Ibaka | Russell Westbrook | 774 | | Anthony Davis | Jrue Holiday | 770 | | Clint Capela | James Harden | 760 | | Vince Carter | Jason Kidd | 760 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Kidd | 753 | | Dirk Nowitzki | Jason Terry | 744 | | Mehmet Okur | Deron Williams | 740 | | Marcin Gortat | John Wall | 735 | | Paul Pierce | Rajon Rondo | 727 | | Shaquille O'Neal | Kobe Bryant | 727 | | Tony Parker | Tim Duncan | 713 | | Juwan Howard | Rod Strickland | 711 | | Udonis Haslem | Dwyane Wade | 702 | | Clifford Robinson | Jason Kidd | 694 | | Tim Duncan | Manu Ginóbili | 672 | | Klay Thompson | Draymond Green | 668 | | Paul Pierce | Antoine Walker | 666 | | Jermaine O'Neal | Jamaal Tinsley | 648 | | Josh Smith | Joe Johnson | 636 | | Glenn Robinson | Sam Cassell | 633 | | J.J.

"Between the reactions to Anthony Davis’ ailments and this, r/NBA has solidified it self as a cesspool of degenerate pseudo-sociopaths."
"Dwight's easily better and more accomplished than Anthony Davis and Dame. Might make an argument for Melo too but he belongs on the list, i think.  Not really singling those guys out in particular though. There's other questionable/borderline choices like Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Reggie Miller.   Dwight's better than all those guys."
"Anthony Davis – has the skill and physique to be a generational player, but falls down to the floor and cries on every play."
"&gt; top 25 player  In my perspective, a Top 25-30 player are players who are good enough to be the #1 option of any team so in my eyes a Top 30 player is someone more or less of a shooter. Think Zach Lavine, Bradley Beal, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis etc. I don't think Dray scores enough to warrant him a Top 30 seal but okay.  Dray is in the 31-40 range coz he is a stellar 2nd most important player on the team guy."
LOL Anthony Davis a gang member? Anthony Davis? Cmon really
Laimbeer snd Mahorn we’re real men so was Anthony Mason Dale Davis…these cats today soft beeen babied from primary school and most live in a bubble.
Anthony Davis could never
No one laughed when they got AD lol. It’s Anthony fricken Davis
And meanwhile we don’t have any reliable double digit scorers besides Graham and JV. Could you spare us some offense? We’ll give you Anthony Davis.
"This place hates Anthony Davis lol.  Pelican fans, for good reason, don't like him and Laker fans treat him like they used to treat Pau and Lebron fans pretty much hate all his co-stars because they're never doing enough or don't deserve any credit.  His ratio to hates to fans is large.   The fact is it never matters to anyone he plays through injuries because they're annoyed he's hurt in the first place, which is insane. Lebron has been far more injury prone since coming to the Lakers but no one says anything about that and excuses his poor play post-injuries on the injuries, but with AD it's just non-stop attacks."
If that’s the case then why are all of Anthony Davis career numbers better and why does anythony Davis have more accolades than Joel?
“You know how I know you’re gay?” How “you watch the uncensored version of Anthony Davis in the locker room”
How is Anthony Davis corny for being injury prone? That’s out of his control.
"Corniest players in the league:  1.  LeCringe James  2. The entirety of the Miami Heat (minus Spo, but incl. Riley)  3. Anthony ""Day to Day"" Davis"
had to double take Anthony/Davis like what now? Two ADs is that even legal?
"I'm not a russ/lakers/lebron fan at all, but I just wanna see Russ/Reaves/LeBron/Anthony/Davis as a  5 for a long stint before we can really see how good this team can be, though in garbage time that 5 played really good against the suns"

You would really make the argument that Carmelo Anthony has been more impactful on defense than Anthony Davis...
"If you only look at the throw up stats over the last three days, I am actually statistically better than Anthony Davis."
Carmelo Anthony Davis.
ANTHONY TOP 75 EVER DAVIS
Anthony Davis is soft as fuck
ANTHONY AIRBALL DAVIS LMAOOOO
Anthony Davis is soft as fuck. You settled for a shit contested 3
Only Terry Rozier sees Anthony Davis guarding him as a mismatch.  He is THE irrational confidence guy.
anthony davis is the goat of going into the back looking like he's dying and then comign out and dominating
Anthony Davis is huge
"Settle down, it's Jimmy Butler we're talking about, not Anthony Davis"
[Anthony Davis:](https://imgur.com/a/QO8Osk1)👀
How many world class athletes have died from Covid? Athletes sit out cause of a stomach ache just look at Anthony Davis.
Anthony 'PJs' Davis
I would put Gobert pretty significantly ahead of both Anthony Davis and Giannis.  Gobert has a pretty strong argument for best defender in the league even if he is not the most versatile.  AD is elite when healthy and engaged which is rare honestly.  I think Giannis is very overrated on the defensive end.
Anthony Davis needs to learn how to defend his body from injury before he can be in that conversation
anthony davis sucked my cock ama
Anthony Davis never quit on his team lmao why do people keep saying this
Anthony Davis is a loser
"Using this list and your assists #s above, here's assists per game (from most):  * Anthony Davis:	2.05  * Kevin Love:	1.59  * Chris Bosh:	1.35  * Kyle Kuzma:	1.35  * Zydrunas Ilgauskas:	1.22  * Dwyane Wade:	1.15  * Drew Gooden:	1.15  * Mo Williams:	1.04  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:	0.90  * J.R.

"Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms, at night I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.  -Anthony Davis"
Anthony “street clothes” Day to Davis
Do you think he wants a trade? Idk he may be pulling a Anthony Davis. I’d bet there’s a good market for him. I’d hate to have him if he’s not fully invested in the rebuild.
"Anthony Davis after all star weekend: “We’re the Lakers. We got a team that’s well put together that can win 10, 12, 15 games in a row. We can do it. We just got to want to do it.”"
"Well then I don’t know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren’t good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we’ve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they’re at risk of a shot clock violation."
"AD is horrifying from 3. We always mock Russ but he’s like Steph by comparison. AD just needs to not shoot 3s, even in that weird Barkley way where it probably got some defenders to play him close at the 3 even though be shot 25%. That doesn’t fly anymore and AD shoots even worse.   Say it with me everyone - stop shooting 3 pointers, Anthony Davis. Just stop it."
Poor Rudy and Anthony Davis lmao. Both in similar spots defensively. They can’t cover for everyone on the floor
Gentry always knew how to coach a loss out of Anthony Davis
Still on my soapbox sayin ANTHONY DAVIS IS NOT TOP75
You pledge allegiance to Anthony Davis I see. Brave.
Ow boy. How is lebron -7 with 49+ minutes played. And anthony davis -16? The few minutes they were off the floor the lakers were on pace to win in a blowout.
Anthony Davis is cheeks unless he wants to be a monster
"Anthony Davis has more all stars, all nba, all defense, and was a major contributor to a ring so I’d say him"
Marvin fucking Bagley outplayed Anthony Davis in a clutch game
AnThOnY dAvIs Is gOiNg tO bE LeBrOn’S sUcCesSor
"Look, LeBron and Anthony Davis are HoF players and have seen it all. Seen it all...except for Alex Len and Marvin Bagley"
Who's the better AD? Anthony Davis or Adrian Dantley?
That was the best worst game I’ve ever watched. Some of those offensive possessions made me want to stop watching basketball altogether.  Anthony Davis is a monster.  One of the best Fox games I’ve seen.  Wtf.
"James, Anthony, Davis, Westbrook, and Monk are all over 40 minutes, jeesh"
Hield showed up tonight!! And Anthony Davis. Whew
"Anthony Davis has gone soft, ladies and gentlemen."
"Anthony Davis made the NBA 75  team over Dwight Howard, so it can't be that ugly people are being underrated."
John Wall doesn't sell tickets  Anthony Davis sells tickets  follow the money lol  NBA is an entertainment
"What? Im sorry, but did Anthony Davis die or did i just imagined him existing?  Dude has played 85 career games and people are out here calling him better than Anthony freaking Davis, a first ballot HoFer and NBA champion that carried the sorry ass Pelicans to the second round once.  Zion gets hate because he is a professional athlete that manages to be fucking fat and even then not many people hate him for that. He is a professional athlete that gets paid MILLIONS for what he does, the fact that he can't stay in shape and then gets injured for it is asinine, he deserves the criticism."
"Look at Dwayne Wade early in his career. Or Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose. Anthony Davis.   Hell, even Kevin Durant. They all came into the league firing, and none except *maybe* Kevin Durant are considered top 10 players, and Durant was far better in his first few years than Luka was."
And that’s why he’s Anthony Day to Davis
It should be illegal to suggest an Anthony Davis trade can happen with Andrew Wiggins as the centerpiece
and anthony davis helped us win a ring
You have Anthony Davis on your team
"is that the reality though?  I see people saying the Buss family is poor but haven't seen evidence that backs it up.    [the Lakers reportedly make $300 million per year on their tv deals alone.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2901856-report-lakers-likely-wont-have-issue-re-signing-anthony-davis-due-to-tv-deal)  they're always top 10 in attendance, have the highest average ticket prices, and they usually lead merchandise sales.  they generate the most revenue of any team in the league and it doesn't seem close.  there's no real reason to say that the Buss family have a real cash flow problem."
"Dwight Howard and Tony Parker should have both been on that list over Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. The one was the face of a franchise (Dwight for Magic) and was legitimately a top-5 MVP player during his peak years, while the other (TP) was a 6-time all-star, 4-time champion, and a finals MVP -- not to mention that TP is among the leaders in playoff points in the paint, **as a point guard.**   Anthony Davis has only won one 'chip and has not even been the FMVP of that series and Damian Lillard has never reached the peaks of Parker's career yet they are in the 75-team really just shows that they were popularity votes and not legacy votes."
"I don't follow basketball much anymore but looking at his career stats he seems good no? Average a double double over his career, I would think that doesn't happen a whole lot. It's not a super weak double double either, he's averaging over 20 pts a game while also double digit rebounds.  Unless AD is someone other than Anthony Davis, if so disregard."
"Absolutely. The fact that Dwight Howard is not on the list and Anthony Davis is, is a travesty"
"Anthony Davis gets too much hate on our sub. Just because he’s not playing his playoffs bubble self, people argue he’s declined.  “AD doesn’t drive enough to the rim”  “Trade AD while his value is still high”  “AD doesn’t play with Kobe’s mentality”  Dude can average 25 and 12 and it’s not enough to r/lakers"
"Anthony Davis gets too much hate.

Wtf is wrong with him”  Dude can average 25 and 12 and it’s not enough to r/lakers"
&gt;Anthony Davis will have to shoot the ball outside the bubble.   So will Jamal Murray
"Yeah, it's not like the following factors will play a role -  Jokic has made a significant leap since that time.  We were missing our 2nd best guard.  We signed Aaron Gordon who's arguably one of the best wing defenders in the league.  Anthony Davis will have to shoot the ball outside the bubble."
Any list of a top 75 that includes both Anthony Davis AND Westbrook but NOT Dwight Howard is effin ridiculous to the point of not being worth talking about.   Dwight is the patron saint of cornballs but the disrespect to his impact on the game has to stop.
Definitely should’ve been in the top 75 and not Anthony Davis!
Anthony Day-To-Davis aka Street Clothes
Lebron - The Frozen One  AD- Anthony Day-to-Davis
"I agree.  Anthony Davis is the most glaring admission to the list for me.  He has always been regarded for his potential, and what he could do, or seemingly will do.  Every year, he's been ranked in the top 5 or 10 players because people think he CAN do that, but he rarely has.  He has NEVER been considered the best player in the league, nor the 2,3,4 or 5th best.  He's just always had a high ceiling, but his play and result are far from that.  Klay Thompson has always been better than AD.  AD would have been better in the 80's... but its not the 80's.    Here are the facts: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html"
Dwight &gt; Anthony Davis. When Davis leads a team to a finals let me know.
"I personally prefer Dwight Howard over Damian Lillard. But I still don't understand Anthony Davis being in the top 75. Before Lebron, all he managed was an 8th seed. He can't carry teams the way Lillard and Howard do."
"He is not wrong but imagine if he had just stayed on the magic and focused on continuing to be amazing there.   He should be on the list, but his ill-fit with both Kobe and Harden followed by his relegation to role player is what the voters remembered.   So it’s not fair to forget his good years, but it was also within his control to continue dominating; and he chose a different path.   People have said, “How come Anthony Davis made it and not Dwight?”  It’s because they remember how each guy played during the Lakers most recent championship run."
"Anthony Davis has a high level of hate for someone who helped save our franchise, I would say AD or DJ"
"Tbf he had some extra motivation partly because he thought he shouldn’t have been suspended for the Stewart incident, so he played with a chip on his shoulder.  Obviously he can’t do that every night anymore, mostly due to Father Time.  But he can still be the best player on any given night.  Just not every night.  And yes, it does seem like he’s preparing for a future beyond basketball.  He’s in LA for other reasons as well.  (So if anything, that Lakers team starts and ends with Anthony Davis and his health.  Unfortunately, The Lakers can’t really rest him)."
"The only 1 and done NCAA champs in recent history are Carmelo Anthony, Greg Oden, and Anthony Davis. At least of the top picks.  It's pretty rare for a freshman to the best player on their college team and they go on to win the title."
"Here's a quote: ""[Anthony made it clear to us that he wants to play and he gives our team the best opportunity to win games](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/02/20/anthony-davis-nba-trade-demand-pelicans-celtics-lakers-kareem-wilt-shaq).""  So, there's that.   You got a source?"

The lakers turned Anthony Davis into Kristaps Porzingis. I just wanted to say that.
Roleplayers don't run entire systems dude. I don't think you know Draymond. Is Rudy Gobert a role player? Is Anthony Davis a roleplayer?
" Anthony Davis is no longer an 82 game player, he's a 16 game player."
"Anthony Davis is no longer an 82 game player, he's a 16 game player."
"Anthony Davis is overrated. I've thought this even during the Lakers championship run (I am a Lakers fan and I like AD).  I think this season has proven that true so far, that he's not quite the player we want him to be. And that's ok, he's still a great player, but accepting his limitations/weaknesses is going to be important to winning games, building a viable team, and competing for another championship."
"Anthony Davis is top 3 in the league in Points in the Paint, is averaging 24/10.5/2 blocks on 57% TS and also a career high in Mid-Range shooting 45% from 16-3p line. He is 9th in the league in points, 8th in the league in rebounds, 3rd in Offensive Rebounds, 2nd in the league in Blocks, 1st in the league in 2 Point Field Goals.  &amp;#x200B;  Please tell me more about how soft he is and how he wants to play patty cake with guards"
Because John Wall isn’t as good as Anthony Davis
&gt;Teams don't have to play you  The Pelicans had to play Anthony Davis even when they didn't want to.
"So what 3 of his rings were with Shaq  MJ had Pippen for his 6 rings  Lebron formed a freakin super team with wade and bosh, then kyrie and klove, then anthony Davis  KAJ had Magic and worthy  Bird had a bunch of Hof  Duncan had manu, tony, kawhi  Russel had  6 hof and a league with 6 teams"

"And Anthony Davis  I know people like to call him soft and that he may've underperformed in some games, but he's still arguably a top 10 player"
"Could people stop pretending they aren’t contenders? Holy fuck as a suns fan I’m tired of seeing these posts and posts about the suns, unless ur tanking or ur team is actually shit then stop worrying about these teams until the playoffs actually come. Also if ur team is winning, cool the season is still early nobody cares it doesn’t mean anything come playoff time(yes warrior fans u can be happy ur good again, now take a deep breathe and relax). The team has Lebron james and Anthony Davis, anything can happen between now and playoffs"
"It is, I’m just pointing out that I spent well over $1k to fly to a city, get a hotel, get tickets to the game, and the tickets were to watch Anthony Davis while he was on the Pelicans.   [Here is the specific game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201511130TOR.html)  Nothing wrong for AD being injured, but the notion people weren’t tuning in to watch AD is BS. I flew across a country to watch AD."
Anthony Davis wanted to play John Wall probably doesn’t
John Wall agreed to not play.  Anthony Davis was upset that his team was attempting to shut him down.  The Anthony Davis being forced to play was one of the weirdest things I have ever seen in professional sports though
Anthony Davis was a superstar in his prime at the time.  John Wall is at best an overpaid rotational player at this juncture of his career post injury.
They deserved Anthony Davis
that's that anthony davis shit lmao
Time for Klay and Wiseman to comeback with Chef Curry and shut all that silly bullshit down. LA Relics are old and frail. Anthony Davis is soft as baby shit and Russ only cares about his stat line. LeBron will be on the injury list by January and they may squeeze a #8 seed lol 😂😂😂
when has anthony davis ever acted like he wanted to fight someone??
"yeah it could, but adding more stats would just make the number of occurrences even lower   for anthony davis, 4 games of 29/11/2  add stl and blk and then he only has three repeated statlines: 26/11/2/0/2, 4/1/0/0/0, 21/12/2/0/2 (2 occurrences each)"
"Anthony Davis?  Also this is super cool, is this something that could be expanded to include steals and blocks too, especially since it’s post-merger stats? Not asking you to do extra work just curious about that"
"""I wish Anthony Davis could be more like Chris Duarte"" -Lebron"
Anthony Davis (boo-boo) has been ruled out.
Precious Achiuwa was Anthony Bennett for the entire first half and Anthony Davis in the 3rd quarter.
Anthony Davis (tummyache)
"Remember when the Pelicans had both Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday and the number 1 pick in the Zion draft? Oh how bright the future seemed…"
"Anthony Davis is a front running ninny, we been know this"
Well considering Anthony Davis did in fact play in the NBA your argument holds no weight  The college achievements are merely an add on to his already all time great career in the NBA
"Giannis faced kevin durant on Opening Night and beat him in that game. I know it is a regular season game but Kevin Durant has an MVP player in James harden while giannis has khris Middleton. In my opinion, Giannis is better because if you look at his teammates none of them are in the top 10 player list in the NBA both lebron and kd has anthony davis and james harden. Im not trying to disrespect khris Middleton but the man is inconsistent imagine if giannis had a top 10 player that fits his playing style that is consistent like jayson tatum who is close to being top 10 nobody in the east or NBA is beating the bucks. Giannis can carry a team better kevin durant needs MVP and all star caliber players on his team to succeed"
DAJ - DeAndre Jordan. AD - Anthony Davis. AB - Avery Bradley. THT - Talen Horton-Tucker.  Why Lakers getting all the nicknitials...OP must be from ESPN.  /s
"&gt;lack of future  Lakers have Anthony Davis and happen to be in LA. lol @ ""lack of future""."
"Damn, I would’ve paid money to see the epic Anthony Davis vs. Dalai Lama showdown."
"Lol no real end in sight. Do you also write dramas? I'd love to read some of your soap operas. The no end in sight Lakers of post-Kobe attracted LeBron and Anthony Davis. I know fan fiction gets you all excited that the Lakers will be bad, but that's just not the case. The Spurs, on the other hand... another Tim Duncan is not walking through that door and Pop is old. Sorry, unlike the Alamo, your rep as a winning franchise will soon be forgotten."
Anthony Davis was a +8 in this game
Anthony Davis is a lock
"just not for ariza? Ariza gt 15 million from the suns. 7 million over his current contract.  Rockets were a first time tax team.  Thats literally a lump sump of small change to ""run it back"" when your team is one game from the finals and your best two players call him the veteran leader who keeps the team together....  And if you are going to let that go, how about a replacement when you are in win now mode?   They didn't use the mid level, traded picks and assets to get under the tax, and signed minimum only to replace him and then even traded those(james ennis his replacement was traded for a 2nd rounder top 55 protected mid season while he was in the rotation...what excuse for that?)  Daniel house the dleague replacement was cut and let go for two months mid season.  In an age of load management when your star isn't resting and playing abovve and beyond and then you make his job harder? hes going to go where the market allows and an ownership who is willing to spend and support.  Let alone that tilman was quoted saying rockets have the worst practice facility in the league and he will update it..said that in 2017...never happened.  And arizas contract was a one year expriing..no future risk, EASILY TRADEable . He was traded...for Kelly oubre that very year . Then kelly wass traded with rubio for....Chris paul(another guy tilman leaked was a bad contract)  Funny how suns made the finals paying and risking on guys that we wouldn't.  So its about assets and keeping them.  We had a one year risk for ariza, no replacements in sight, and had flexiblity ot trade him if we wanted...we just said no for savings  our other moves(trading first picks, rotation players) all coincidentally led us to get under the tax each year.  Chris paul then was quoted saying the main thing we missed in 2019 was ariza, he kept hte glue going had harden and pauls respect.  but hes a non headliner and people don't get it. Just like Rondo iwth pelicans. Led them to their best year in playoffs, anthony davis san his praise and rondo wanted to run it back. they replaced him with Elfrid payton and if you are a box score guy you think they are the same, but thats where they miss it.  The mavs genius ofense was literally a brilliant luka just like harden dominating the ball...are you serious?  Silas is a great and well liked guy. that goes far when its more player driven and run than evr.  but I don't blame him, hell don't blame harden or the gm or coach wanting out of this mess bc the culture of the new ownership was save save save and run this like a mid tier restraunt where the new status quo of nets/clipperes is spend like crazy and thats why those terrible destinations are now drawing stars while people are running from a great place like houston bc of tilman.    Ask your self why jvg didnt entertain the rockets? Or any other star or coach who would've also demanded out bc the league is spending nad rockets are saving"
I thinkt this sub forgot that Anthony Davis exists in this thread
And Anthony Davis had the highest +- on the team but was ass. Climb back into your hole and don’t come out until you learn that single game +- is a useless statistic.
Lakers fans coming to the realization that Anthony “I’ll play the 5 this year” Davis is straight cap is entertaining.
Anthony Davis. The only option is to trade everyone lol.
While a good passer he’s never been in a system like the Warriors offense. He’d disrupt their chemistry if it’s a midseason deal. And if Lacob is talking about win both now and later he won’t trade for a 37 year old who gets rid of youth on teams and who you don’t know how long he’ll play. You’d at least want someone who can play with Steph when he’s 36. You can’t guarantee 40 Y/O Bron is that. I’m not joking Bob Myers and Joe Lacob respectfully decline. Now Anthony Davis? That’s a different story.
anthony davis was in the top75  bottom text
Don't worry the real bubble boy Anthony Davis plays on the Lakers anyway
Anthony Davis refused to play the 5 which made the lakers have to play him with another big and as a starter lol
"&gt; Anthony Davis doesn’t have that dog in him. Yes, I know he was sick. Always something with him…  You guys won a ring with him and he was fucking incredible during that regular season and the bubble playoffs. I get you’re frustrated but this is just stupid."
Watching this sub post about Anthony Davis every single day when LeBron is out is disappointing to see.
"Such a pleasure watching Anthony Davis, top 75 player of all time, really take over these kinds of games and carry his team"
Anthony Davis is not on the level of Jokic and Embiid
Anthony Davis: the joke of the century
"**Los Angeles Lakers: 37% FG, 30% 3PT, 21/30 (70%) FT**  This is a such a disappointing loss.  On one hand you appreciate the effort LAL showed to erase the 25 point deficit. On the other hand, it was a very winnable game once we came back. And we probably won’t win with those numbers above.  Props to Russell Westbrook. He showed up, especially in the second half.  Anthony Davis doesn’t have that dog in him. Yes, I know he was sick. Always something with him…"
Anthony Davis needs to play like his height.
Anthony Davis is the dollar store Wood
"Tonight we'll see the best, most skilled, big man in the league take on Anthony Davis."
Anthony Davis
Remember when he left covering Anthony Davis for a wide open 3 to win the game? Ugh
"Including that effing buzzer beater by Anthony Davis - quintessential missed defense by Plumlee, who just gave up on that play. I'm not saying he could've stopped AD from making the shot, but that is an example of how shitty his defense is"
wtf is this thread it's easily Anthony Davis or has nobody here watched the playoffs
Anthony Davis made Jokic his child. Embiid sucks. Giannis got exposed again
"""Just bust everybody's ass."" ***Anthony Davis intensifies***"
Did you watch him im NO?  Did you watch Bosh in Toronto?   LA Anthony Davis takes less shots overall but more jumpers now. He played his 2nd least amount of games last year but still  took more 3s then he ever has by far.
"No. You are talking about doubling his minutes and expecting the same amount of production with the same level of efficiency which is just ridiculous. Not to mention the flawed logic that you included.  &gt; Couldn't win with Lebron  He was a second year player and Lebron was injured and sat the second half of the season.   &gt; Won a title and proved that he can be a consistent role player on a championship team. Can win with Lebron  Yeah, don't mention that they added Anthony Davis at all or that they played a team that they would have been still expected to beat even without him or that he didn't start on a team where the PG was a weak spot, or that he still only played about 66% of the minutes that Lonzo averages. What you are arguing has a lot of holes in it."
"Chad Tim Duncan: GOAT power forward, so elite he can abuse centers on both sides of the floor  Beta Anthony Davis: Not even best player on his team, is a center who hates guarding centers so he plays power forward"
Jokic has for years benefited from his teams still being very good when he’s not on the court. It only makes Reddit sense to catapult him into MVP talks because it’s not true one year.  Meanwhile Anthony Davis had empty stats because his team sucked when he was off the court.
"Lol, Steph was already fading away when he caught the ball, because he saw Anthony freaking Davis run towards him. Still nailed the clutch shot. It's also the same spot where he got Gortat flying to Poland with his fake lol."

"Basketball Reference has a HOF probability page [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html). Active players are in **bold** in the table.   I can see 3 active players below 30 years old: Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo."
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
Anthony Davis
"Which one or two of the following would you place below Anthony Davis? Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Charles Barkley, Bob Pettit, or Kevin McHale?"
I remember this from last year. Lmao. “WEaK SchEduLe” Wonder how many of these we’ll see again this year. We’re obviously going to see “lewashed” “Anthony day to Davis”
That was him last year with the Anthony Davis trade. Aged like milk.
Well Anthony Davis comparisons. Jermaine always had the range and supreme athleticism just different era. Don’t forget he was 3rd in MVP voting
In a few months they'll be as close as naked ass slapping just like Anthony Davis was at Kentucky.
How could Lebron win MVP playing alongside Anthony Davis? They would take votes away from each other. Same thing happened with Durant and Curry back then.
"The specificity of the stats is kind of silly, but I'm always impressed by a 5-5-5-5 statline. For me it has always been a great representation of a well-rounded game.  For anyone curious about the players who have done this in NBA history:  Hakeem Olajuwon (x6)  Andrei Kirilenko (x3)  Dr. J (x2)  George T. Johnson (x1)  George Gervin (x1)  David Robinson (x1)  Derek Coleman (x1)  Vlade Divac (x1)  Jamaal Tinsley (x1)  Marcus Camby (x1)  Nicolas Batum (x1)  Draymond Green (x1)  Anthony Davis (x1)  Jusuf Nurkic (x1)"
Rolls Royce Anthony Davis looking amazing.
"8th best player in the NBA.  I’d rather have LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving."
Statistically? Christian Wood. Playstyle? Jerami Grant or Darius Bazley  I think Anthony Davis is a rich man's Marion actually.
What? Anthony Davis and Giannis can both guard the perimeter... better than Bam.

"Harden is probably the most egregious after the past year...but there’s multiple instances. Anthony Davis “that’s all folks!”, LeBron drinking wine on the sideline load managing...it’s endless"
yea not quite how i'd describe anthony davis either
Randle or Anthony Davis posts incoming
The difference between Randle and Sabonis is the difference between Anthony Davis and Montrezl Harrell
"Anthony Davis is still an improved shooter so far into this season, if he keeps it up you can't throw in his jumper. He's averaging 59% from 3-10, 47% from 16-three and 40% from behind the arc which is overall better then he was in the bubble"
Yet Anthony Davis is better than any of those bums could ever dream of becoming
With the shortened offseason it seems like the Lakers are taking it slow in the beginning. Especially considering LeBron’s age.  At the end of the day you have to beat LeBron and Anthony Davis in a 7 game series which I still can’t see happening
"There’s really no way. Just do what you value. The bucks sure as hell don’t need an Anthony Davis the way the lakers don’t need Giannis.  It’s hard  But for that low PAPG, etc, just know that Giannis and Gobert are the kings of advanced defensive metrics."
Didn’t they do this with Anthony Davis free throws on Tuesday as well? Should’ve been 3/4 but ended 2/3. Gave the extra free throw to Schroder. (5:39 in the 4th quarter technical free throw)
Yeah or even Anthony Davis would be really helpful.
"&gt; Against the pelicans we shot ourselves in the foot  I mean, we shot one foot. The refs shot the other.  &gt; The 2 games against the lakers I thought we looked really good, they’re just better than us and won.  The only thing we need is a big man that can match up well with Anthony Davis. Someone like Anthony Davis would be perfect."
I definitely bought into Wiggins hype. I honestly thought he'd have a better career than Anthony Davis
"he'd also never talk smack about anyone he doesn't think is firmly 'below' him. I'm sure he's got these insecure opinions on a lot of players, but knows better than to call out the Jokic's and Anthony Davis' of the world, he made that mistake with Kobe and look how that turned out for him."
How so? Rivers played with a rookie Anthony Davis. Joe’s comment implied that he had not.  &gt;	he clarified saying rookies he's played with  I’m not disputing Rivers’ opinion at all.. that’s neither here nor there.
League's fucked now that Taller Anthony Davis is taking the weights off
"I know Shaq doesn't necessarily need to be going at heads the way he does, but it is what it is.  The contract comment, well I just see that as an overarching comment for a lot of the contracts that are given, Gobert's contract just happened to be the most recent and yeah if I'm looking Giannis who just got paid and Gobert...I'm not going to say that Gobert deserves $200M like Giannis does or Anthony Davis.  Gobert is legit but he's not elite and if the cap money didn't need to be spent, I don't see anyone giving him a $200M deal.  Shaq does speaks a lot on this, but I'm sure it's a sentiment that plenty of older players share.  Lot of the players getting paid today are nowhere near as good as players from past but they can still get $20M/yr where back in the 80s/90s it would take an elite player like 10yrs to reach that amount. Tobias Harris worth his contract or was Hassan Whiteside when he got paid?  Even Jordan wasn't getting his money until he came back from retirement and he was damn sure much more valuable than just a couple million/yr that he was getting."
"AD fits well with any offense. He was averaging 28 and 12 on elite efficiency with Jrue.   The Celtics use bums like Theis as a 3pt shooter and pick and pop player.   Imagine replacing Theis and Timelord with Anthony Davis...""doesn't fit well"" lmao  Taytum, Brown, and AD instantly turn the Celtics into one of the most athletic teams of all time with much better spacing than they currently have"
"In what way am I gloating? All I said is that in hindsight; the Kings dodged a bullet. Cousins has had a lot of injuries and that sucks for his career. The Kings traded him before he got injured to a pretty good situation in New Orleans with Anthony Davis. It’s unfortunate but would’ve been worse for the Kings if they had Cousins on a Supermax with an Achilles tear, calf injury, and a torn ACL."
Kevin Garnett playing his whole career in the current era would play as a center his whole career instead of those years as a power forward next to Rasho Nesterovic. He had good enough shooting mechanics that he would've been able to extend his range to the 3-pt line as well. I feel like he'd be an even better version of what we get when Anthony Davis plays at center.
"The only reason it didnt work for the Pelicans was that he got hurt - and no one could predict that.  At the time he and Anthony Davis were playing real well together.  In fact, you could speculate that Anthony Davis may still be a Pelican today if Boogie was healthy and resigned."
Anthony Davis by a mile.
"Starting from scratch I’d take jokic for a few reasons   1. Anthony Davis has had injury problems in the past. If I’m starting from the beginning I can’t have my best player be hurt   2. Jokic makes everyone around him better   3. Although Anthony Davis is a significantly better defender which I value greatly, jokic isn’t the worst thing in the world playing center. The nuggets are 29th this season but it’s not all on jokic   4. I’ve seen what jokic can do as the number one option. 1 game away from the wcf and a trip to the wcf. Davis made the second round once and got smacked by a golden state team missing curry the first two games.   5. Although the gap isn’t significant, jokic is two years younger which means more time  6. I feel at the tail end of their careers jokic will be better as his game relies more on skill than athleticism. Davis is very skilled as well but jokic is a better decision maker and ball handler   It’s really close and there is no wrong answer here imo."
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Jokic would feast any lineup in the league  or steph, klay, kd, draymond, AD if you cared about defense"
The Nuggets are currently ranked 29th in defense lmao. Anthony Davis  You aren't winning a chip with a center who's a neutral at best defender
"No he wasn’t.  He was 13th in assists, I wonder if that has anything to do with playing with Anthony fucking Davis."
Anthony Davis
how about showing deanthony meltonj blocking anthony davis and dunking on tht
Semi-related: post-Lebron Anthony Davis is going to be fascinating to see.
"""*I only really need to shoot 3's.*"" - Anthony Davis"
Anthony Davis is currently playing better than Kawhi Leonard and has been since last season including the postseason  Not that crazy of a take
"RIP Kuzma - Caruso - THT superteam, end of a dynasty. Hopefully the Lakers can pick themselves back up and rebuild around promising young talent such as Lebron James and Anthony Davis"
Worst shooting game of the season thus far for us  Thankfully we have Lebron Mfking James and Anthony Mfking Davis
"Because it's just as ridiculous and insulting to suggest that it's black and white that one was the beneficiary of help while the other was the architect of their own success. Both are legendary players with incredible propaganda behind them and the beneficiaries of great FO (like literally all great players) yet people are trying to pretend they are any different in how they approached the game.  The way 2016 is talked about you'd think Lebron carried G Leaguers who shot 2% from 3 to the title and not had an incredible team loaded with shooters with an amazing scorer in Kyrie Irving who were favourites over literally the exact same team the year before. You'd really think Lebron was ""coming home"" rather than going to a team with 3 no.1 picks, 2 top players in Kevin Love and Kyrie guaranteed to join at the time, and a FO willing to do whatever it took to get the exact roster construction Lebron wanted.  The Heatles (along with the recent warriors teams) are literally the definition of stacking the deck as much as you can and yet the mental gymnastics people do to say Lebron didn't do anything remotely similar to what KD did are are frankly hilarious. The only major difference worth criticizing more for KD is one joined the team that beat him but in both cases the anticompetitive undertones of their moves are exactly the same. Yet they'll actually portray it in retrospect as if Lebron was ""wronged"" this whole time.  You'd really think the Lakers management didn't get him Anthony Davis, and pulled out ALL the stops to try and get fucking Kawhi to join them as well while loading the team with quality players championship calibre players like Gasol and Green. But sure, Lebron had ""no help"".  It's frankly insane, people here are complaining about how biased the last dance is, which it is of course, it's a) a documentary, and b) storytelling. They're all biased. But then turn around and preach about how Lebron always got the short end of the stick in his NBA career from roster construction and created his own success so much more than Jordan did. When the Lebron documentary inevitably drops, it will be just as biased.  Go on, downvote me. I have karma to spare. But deep down y'all know."
Anthony davis is very good

He's not a GOAT candidate but an absolute hall of famer)  Anthony Davis (1 title)  No other franchise in NBA even comes close to a list of players as storied, impactful, and responsible for more championships and awards as this one."
Anthony Davis
"Jokic is a “7 foot point” because he literally played point his whole youth, same with Anthony Davis. There are plenty of clips of him crossing up dudes and going coast to coast. He’s got handles and is definitely a better ball handler than Bam, you are just trying to prove a point to stick out. Speed also isn’t apart of ball handling, control and literal speed of handle is"
"It was a different game back then. Tough. Guys driving to the net all the time. Big men who were BIG MEN. Anthony Mason. Charles Oakley. And then you had the John Starks type sparkplug type player.  As a Canadian teen at the time, the Knicks kind of represented what New York was. Glitzy and glamorous, but also 'dirty and blue collar'.  You look at a lot of the teams of that era. Indiana with the two Davis'. Chicago. Detroit with their murderers row of tough guys. All really tough teams.  Back then, especially in the East, you needed a guards who could penetrate and score, and big strong men inside to bang around and fight for boards.  The game now is all about the perimeter...shooting 3's and perimeter defense.  Part of it also is these guys aren't making $1-3 million a year anymore...they're walking corporations whose health is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  So they're all soft now, and don't put it all on the line like they did back in the day. They played all 82. Played hurt. Not anymore. I'm very glad I got to see all of MJ's career...and the tail end of Magic/Bird.  LeBron era has been great up until the last couple of years when Steph and the 3 took over. Now...the game is mostly chucking 3's track meet."

"We’re 7 games in where most guys have crazy inflated stats and he’s still averaging almost identical PPG all of the last 3 years, including when he played alongside Anthony Davis and averaged 21 a game in the same lineup as Anthony Davis and Jrue Holiday. He’s now averaging 22 with RJ Barrett and Reggie Bullock. This is who he is and why the Knicks paid him. Miles different is when DLo jumped 6 PPG including a few 40 point showings. I know Knicks fans are dying to make that leap and become attractive again, but if it’s going to happen it has to be RJ and not Randle who does that, plain and simple."

"KAT is hurt, our best defender (Okogie) is hurt, and our options at the 4 (Hernangomez and Layman) have been abysmal so far this season.  We are getting smoked in the paint and haven't looked competent on offense since KAT went down after starting 2-0.  Basically, we don't have a reliable 4 and we are left starting Naz Reid or Ed Davis at the 5 which is not ideal.  The team looks lost offensively with KAT being out and I attribute that to poor coaching. Saunders is the son of a franchise icon coach and people are starting to realize he wouldn't be in this position without nepotism.  Dlo has looked bad, but he is at his best in the PnR game, and Reid/Davis are obviously much, much worse at that than KAT.  Dlo had some success with Davis last game, Malik Beasley is a flamethrower, and Anthony Edwards looks extremely promising in the limited opportunities he is getting.  We can turn it around (hopefully) but KAT being out shows just how dependent our roster is on him to succeed."
"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn’t change anything."
How many conference finals did Anthony Davis make before he joined LeBron James?
If jerami grant ends the season averaging more than Anthony Davis I’m not sure how I’ll react

"&gt;	But let’s not pretend he didn’t have help during his championship years. Anthony Davis is by far the best teammate either LBJ or MJ has played with ever. Vogel is a very good defensive coach.  Nobody is saying you can’t have help, I’m saying that MJ didn’t do much of anything without help or a HOF head coach meanwhile lebron took two different Cavs teams that didn’t belong in the finals to the finals, in addition to being the best player on a finals team for three different franchises. MJ has only won championships with one team, one coach and one #2, lebron has made it work with Kyrie, Wade + Bosh and with AD. MJ has only won with Pippen and Jackson, and when he didn’t have either, he didnt do much and he couldn’t even get the Wizards to the 8th seed in the most watered down version of the East we’ve seen over the last 25 years.  He’s proven to be a very successful Chicago bulls player when they have Pippen and Jackson. Lebron has won with many different combinations of players and coaches and has won 3 finals MVPs with 3 different franchises. They’re incomparable imo, once Lebron did it for a third time they became incomparable.   LeBron is the system, he’s the element that has found a way no matter who you put next to him or who coached him. Jordan won when you gave him a Pippen and a Jackson and when he didn’t have that, he was getting bounced in the first round. Lebron made the finals with Kevin Love and George Hill and Larry Hughes and 90 year old llgalskus.  Jordan is one of the greatest players of all time, but you cannot be the GOAT when you’ve only been successful with one set of circumstances. Lebron doesn’t need a triangle or a HOF coach, give him a great #2 and he’ll find a way to win. Give him a mediocre roster and a mediocre coach and he’ll still make it there, unfortunately for him he ran into the spurs and warriors dynasties when he lots with those rosters.   You can’t compare Jordan to LeBron, that argument ended last season. LeBron is the greatest player of all time because he will find a way to make it work, he is the system. The greatest player of all time cannot only be successful under one set of circumstances in one conference. Lebron has won in both, with 3 teams now, with 3 different #2s, with 3 different coaches. Compare MJ to Duncan and KAJ, players that always had perfect circumstances."
"That’s all good for Lebron and he has a good case for GOAT.  But let’s not pretend he didn’t have help during his championship years.  Anthony Davis is by far the best teammate either LBJ or MJ has played with ever.  Vogel is a very good defensive coach.    MJ’s second three peat is where the argument of the perfect circumstances are more valid.  Watered down league with Rodman and Pippen.  But then again that really only applies to 96 and 97, 1998 was a carry job by MJ.    In the end we cant put these players in a simulation and play against every team in every era in every condition.  Both players are much closer than what both camps think."
Anthony Davis shot 55% from 16+ last year. Analytics says that’s fine.
"Anthony Davis and Giannis are basically 7 feet. But among true 7 footers, KAT and Embiid are pretty athletic too"
"Well Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Bradley Beal etc.."
"I wanted Charlotte to do whatever it takes to get Wiseman and avoid Ball at all costs.  Ball has been much better than I anticipated so far, but I hate that we couldn't find a way to move up.  Charlotte has missed all of Shaq, Dwight Howard, CP3, Aldridge, Anthony Davis by a single pick, and wound up with Mourning (can't complain really), Okafor, Felton, Morrison, and MKG with the very next pick (all top 5 picks). Any one of those five legends completely changes the course of the franchise. It honestly would not shock me if Wiseman became an all-star level center. Melo is quite interesting at the moment but I don't know how likely it is for him to reach a star level."
Cavs were without kyrie as well. In 2018 he dragged them through a weak east and he gets credit for that but if kyrie had stayed they would not have been the worst team. They could’ve made the playoffs potentially considering Orlando was an 8th seed.   Lakers have Anthony Davis. It’s two top 5 players teaming up. Many just off that will consider it a superteam. This year the lakers are completely stacked.
It was a lottery team with him and without anthony davis
"Kawhi has had 2-3 major chokes, Harden has 2017 as his choke vs Spurs (overall), Lebron has 2011, Curry has 2016 with the 2018 Houston series, Anthony Davis has only been to 3 playoffs (was amazing in all 3), and KD has 2016 3-1 and a couple different series’s.   I’m autistic yet you’re the one that thinks Harden has more chokes than everyone. Cant even fathom that all the other star players have had too 5 players next to them (only Kawhi and Harden haven’t.)"
"Lol you know that announcer was about to say ""Anthony Davis"" but pulled it right back at the last second"
anthony davis gonna retire sooner than lebron
Yeah. These were the odds   Luka Doncic +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo +425 Stephen Curry +500 LeBron James +700 Anthony Davis +700 James Harden +800 Kawhi Leonard +900 Kevin Durant +1000
“Much more than what he was” is basically asking for the next lebron james to be a center.  Boogie was an absolute phenom at the center position.  He averaged 27/11 before getting traded to NOLA where he averaged 25/13 while sharing the front court with Anthony Davis before getting injured at 27 years old. He was also shooting 35-37% from 3 as a center. I firmly believe he could have been a major piece on a ring team  He was stat stuffing because he was on the fucking Kings lol
"anthony davis is not playing that well, LBJ is not pushing himself and they are 5-2. This season is just to watch how the young guys developing I guess."
Anthony Davis
Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis
"Don't forget Anthony Davis, who is the defensive anchor for the leagues \#3 ranked defence.      Gobert is leading the \#4 ranked defence and Myles the 9th ranked, when he plays, for what it's worth."
Offense:  -	Steph Curry -	James Harden -	Kevin Durant -	LeBron James -	Nikola Jokic  Defense:  -	Jrue Holiday -	Kawhi Leonard -	Ben Simmons -	Giannis Antetekounmpo -	Anthony Davis/Rudy Gobert
"I've responded to every substantive point you made. And Ben Simmons played at an All-Star level that year, plus Covington, Saric, and Reddick all well above replacement level (I'm assuming you meant Simmons rookie year, since the 76'ers went 28-54 in Embiid's rookie season). Booker's Suns missed the playoffs. Wiggins and Lavine were absolutely *miserable* those years (and Wiggins hasn't really improved much since)- Lavine was literally one of the worst players to receive regular minutes in the NBA those first couple years. So, that's a swing and a miss on those.  The fact remains that basketball is a team sport, its not only possible but relatively common for good players to play on bad teams (KAT, Bradley Beal, pre-Lakers Anthony Davis, etc.), and literally ALL of the available evidence supports the proposition that KAT's positive impact is comparable to that of e.g. Jokic, and that the main difference is in their supporting cast."
&gt;They still don’t have a closer.  If only they had someone like a LeBron James or Anthony Davis to close out games smh
"Anthony Davis is two pretty common names. And AD sounds good. So we call him AD.  Kyrie Irving has a really cool firstname, so he’s Kyrie, not KI"
"He’s not asking who is better or comparing them he’s saying he wishes they could have put Kuzma in the Anthony Davis trade instead of BI, but obviously the Pelicans wanted Ingram"
Anthony Davis did get shit on lmfao. He still played despite wanting to be traded. This is coming from a dude who despises him.
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
A lot of double standards imo... Anthony Davis received no grief despite sitting out a lot of that season. Harden is an easy target.
"I'd give Greg Anthony the nod over Ricky Davis for Nevada. Ricky may have played longer in the NBA, but he has absolutely zero acclaim to his career. Greg Anthony at least helped bring home an NCAA Championship to UNLV, and made second team conference for Big West twice. Think the only thing Ricky helped with was tanking ass to get LeBron, and he did a between the legs dunk in the middle of a game before."
I would rather have a James Harden and Kyrie Irving duo over LeBron James and Anthony Davis duo. Kyrie Irving and James Harden is the greatest backcourt of all time. People are sleeping on Kyrie Irving.
"SOMETIME IN OCTOBER 2019, Joe Boylan, then an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans, received an unexpected text from Brandon Ingram -- one of the franchise's new stars, acquired months earlier in the Anthony Davis trade.  ""I trust you now,"" the message began.  Ingram urged Boylan to coach him hard, invited Boylan to ""motherf---"" him if necessary, whatever it took. It was the same message Ingram had delivered to New Orleans higher-ups on his first day there, when he walked into the office of Jeff Bzdelik, then the Pelicans' lead assistant, and declared, ""I think I have greatness in me. I want you to get it out of me, and I don't care what you do,"" several in that room recalled.  Days after that text, Ingram arrived a few minutes late to his appointment at the training table. That was not unusual. Ingram is a night owl. Boylan lit into him in front of the training staff: ""This is why the Lakers got rid of you! This motherf---er wants to be great? No! He wants to be comfortable.""  Boylan's delivery was so over the top, everyone knew it was somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Boylan reminded Ingram that his lateness delayed players behind him on the schedule.  Ingram smiled and took it. ""I like being called out,"" he said. ""Players at this level think they're above that. I'm still a few minutes late sometimes, but I'm much better.""  Perry Tyndall, Ingram's coach at Kinston High School in eastern North Carolina, called out Ingram only once -- when Ingram shrugged and refused to make eye contact as Tyndall criticized Kinston's starters for losing to backups in practice. Tyndall ripped Ingram. He felt bad about it almost right away.  When Tyndall arrived home, he was surprised to receive a text from Ingram apologizing. ""I realized I'm being cussed at for a reason,"" Ingram said. ""If I'm the leader of this team, that is going to trickle down. I had to be sharper. I had to be on top of my s---.""  When Ingram and Stan Van Gundy met at Ingram's rental home in Miami in October for their first sit-down, Ingram told his new coach he was ready for heavy scrutiny. ""What struck me was how self-aware he was,"" Van Gundy said. Ingram admitted to Van Gundy that his defense had slipped as he embraced a larger scoring role. Ingram vowed to improve his playmaking. After earning individual glory -- plus a new five-year, $158 million contract -- Ingram was ready to focus on passing and defense.  ""One of the blessings of him being an All-Star and getting that contract is that he is at peace that you know he's really good,"" said David Griffin, the Pelicans' personnel chief. ""He's just playing his game.""  Van Gundy walked out of Ingram's house and called his brother, Jeff, a decorated coach and current analyst for ESPN. ""This guy,"" Van Gundy told his brother, ""is the real deal.""  Ingram is one of the most important swing players in determining the NBA's balance of power. If he becomes the player he thinks he can be -- a two-way superstar who approaches double digits in assists -- the Pelicans have a chance to contend for titles around Ingram and Zion Williamson. Boylan often told Ingram that New Orleans could win championships if he became their Scottie Pippen.  If Ingram plateaus as an average (or maybe worse) defender and B-plus passer, the Pelicans' ceiling won't reach as high.  Ingram is averaging 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game -- almost identical to his numbers last season. His shooting is down, but he's more dialed in on defense.  Teammates have noticed Ingram moving the ball earlier, but it hasn't resulted in the leap in assists his opening-night near triple-double against the Toronto Raptors portended.  ""That's what you should average,"" JJ Redick, a New Orleans guard, told Ingram after that game.  Redick has been exhorting Ingram since last season that he might average a triple-double, and become a top-10 player.  ""I'm not gonna stop until I'm the best,"" Ingram once replied."
Giannis and Gobert really not benefitting from no fans. The anti Anthony Davis and Jamal Murray
"Idk, it's a weird comparison to me. Anthony Davis is a generational defensive talent. Wood is like an average defender for his position"
But Anthony Davis had similar rate last season defensively
Anthony Davis at three and that Khris Middleton placement are just gross.
"&gt;Zion's college blocks are not a good indicator of his defence.  So when Anthony Davis put up crazy block numbers in college was that not a good indicator of his defense? Or are we just picking and choosing when stats are good indicators? Obviously it's not a perfect indicator, but when you get lots of blocks and/or steals in college it usually means you're a better defender than guys who don't get lots of blocks/steals."
I hear him called AD way more than I hear him called Anthony Davis. how is that not a nickname
Nephew AD killed your team in the playoffs and his roster was utter shit. He averaged 31/11 with 2 steals and 3 blocks  Green doesn’t want to see any form of Anthony Davis and the lakers in the playoffs.
Zion starting to have the same look on his face as Anthony Davis . “ Get me the fuck outta here “
"which is why its always corny when people call Anthony Davis ""The Brow."" AD will always be his true nickname."
For a second I was thinking 'man Anthony Davis and Embiid would be a pretty funny costream'
"They can’t guard Anthony Davis, and the Lakers can’t guard Harden or Kyrie. It works both ways"
I don't know why or how Mike Dantoni thought it would be okay to use PJ Tucker and Covington with 'help defense' to guard Anthony Davis for a 7 game series.
"Listen I have no idea what other deals were out there for Capela but if Covington was an X factor that suddenly would keep guys like Anthony Davis and Jokic from killing teams, we'd have seen it by now. They traded a true center for a small forward, with no one to replace the center spot and then got shellacked by a team that couldn't miss at the rim and couldn't be stopped from going to the rim, over and over."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis will never win a real championship. Don’t bring up the Mickey Mouse championship.   The Brooklyn Nets run the league now. The Brooklyn Nets have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving.   Nets in 4."
* LeBron James * Anthony Davis * Joel Embiid  Throw in some shooters and it's over.  If you want to throw in Durant then you'll have to swap out James.
"Something I was thinking about was how everyone says the league is downsizing, but it's not centers who are dying out, regardless of what Shaq might say. It's the traditional power forward. If you're big enough, you just slide over to center (Derrick Favors), or play both positions (Anthony Davis). If you're not big enough to play center, then you need to expand your game, most notably with a three-point shot, which Blake, Paul Millsap, and Kevin Love have done in recent years.  Griffin had the ball-handling and passing skills, but he's needed to add the 3 to make up for the changing league, and his body deteriorating.   There aren't a lot of Horace Grant, Brian Grant, Charles Oakley type PFs in today's league. Most PFs are big wings, and/or have a more perimeter-oriented skill set."
"You're not wrong, you just left out Anthony Davis."
"Real picks: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis   Edgy picks: Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jamal Murray"
"&gt; **Can someone explain what Anthony Davis has done to be able to ""coast"" and not care about the regular season?**   More Lakers fans but ...you'd rather have a healthy AD in the playoffs vs. anything you do in the regular season, Shaq was a great example with his mystery ""big toe"" injuries but Lakers fans knew it was about rest or not getting injured."
"**Sixers rookies:**    Maxey: literally the goat. Doesn’t fear anyone on the court. Maxey would drive to rim against Rudy Gobert or Anthony Davis, it’s insane to his confidence. Floater is literally wet as fuck, it’s his best tool and he rapidly looks to be up there with guys like trae and harden in terms of players with best floaters. Good midrange too and the three is better than advertised. Needs to work on getting other guys involved tho, as if there’s times when his shot isn’t falling, a good point guard needs to be able to play-make so they stay on the floor.   Isaiah Joe: looked rough his first couple games, although he was getting spotty minutes and seemed to be really testing the waters in terms of what shots were working best for him. Recently though, he’s been pretty lethal as a catch and shoot guy, like two or three games ago he dropped like 18 and then followed up the next night with like 16. Guy was shooting from pretty deep too. Defensively he’s been alright. Looks like he is already a good team defender, he’s had some smart plays whether it be a steal or a good switch. His struggles are also mainly on the defensive end with defending bigger wings and forwards, so I’m hoping he’s working closely with the strength and conditioning coaches to bulk up. Also doesn’t have enough confidence in his handle, as he can get into the habit of deferring when even a little pressure is applied by the defender. I’m not really worried in this regard, he’s a rookie fighting for minutes trying to only make the right plays and not mess up to much. Although it is harder to tell of what his full capabilities are at this point.    Paul Reed: he’s still gettin out the mud   Nah he hasn’t played much and he’s really more of a old school four aka a small ball five in today’s game and we have plenty of centers so he hasn’t been able to see many minutes."
"&gt;”Here’s the thing though: I’m not sure getting close and not making the deal has missed for Boston. Trade for a couple of guys and you don’t have (Jayson) Tatum or (Jaylen) Brown. Make a deal for AD (Anthony Davis), and you’re out players and picks, and he probably leaves anyway. I think Danny has been right to walk away and not overpay.”  This is logic that you rarely see on r/nba. 99% of the time Ainge didn’t make a trade that we knew of, it was the right move.  AD would’ve absolutely left, unless Kyrie came back (which still doesn’t guarantee he stays).  Kawhi absolutely would’ve left. Yes the Raptors won, but they gave up way less to get Kawhi than Boston would’ve had to. So because of that, they were able to have an elite team around him. Plus, most people agree they don’t win if GS doesn’t lose Durant.   As for PG and Butler, is there anyone else who still believes *to this day* Ainge should’ve traded one of the picks that became Brown or Tatum to get one of those guys? I mean cmon  These are the types of arguments made against Ainge. They always lack context.   Danny Ainge criticism has always been overblown in literally every aspect. He’s firmly a top 5 GM."
Jokes aside even though I’d love to add someone like Drummond at C it wouldn’t work because of the Rose Rule I think.   Forget what the specific detail of the Rose Rule is but I think it’s similar to why Celtics couldn’t trade for Anthony Davis while Kyrie was on the team.
Just google Anthony Davis spanked
"If Christian Wood evolves into Anthony Davis, then Boucher's next evolution would be Christian Wood."
"Imagine playing a handful of college games, not having any training camp or summer league and then immediately facing guys like Anthony Davis."
"&gt;The argument really is; who would you want in clutch time taking the ball? That’s the best player in the East right now and it’s absolutely KD.  I mean that's not the argument, at all. That is based on the premise that just because you are more clutch you are a better player, which is demonstrably false. Just take Lebron, i would take both Harden, KD over him in a last second shot to win the game. Doesnt mean they are better players to have in a 7 games series. There is a bunch of guards that are more clutch and more of a shot-creater than someone like Anthony Davis, and i would pick them in a last second shot to win the game, doesn't mean that AD won't make a bigger impact over a 7 game series.  I just think it is ridiculous that everyone concedes that Giannis and KD have similar offensive outputs, and that Giannis is a much better defensive player, but somehow KD is a so much better player, that it isn't even a discussion. This after last year, where it was voted by a bunch of people who have a whole lot of more basketball knowledge than you or i, that he was the best player in the league. It's illogical as hell."
The sad part is that in the r/lakers they’re already saying that LeBron will be this year’s MVP prior to this game even with a teammate like Anthony Davis sharing the load. I would go as far and say that AD contributes more on defense while LeBron just coasts on that end to preserve his health for the playoffs. Not sure why he is deserving of MVP.
To be fair Giannis makes more threes than Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis stats when guarded by Draymond: 29 possessions, 3 points, 4 assists, 1-7, 0-1 from 3, 1-2 from FT.   AD wasn't passive, he got clamped."
When Anthony Davis head butted looneys shoulder and got a call 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Yea his last 6 games have been: serge ibaka twice, chris boucher, Myles turner and domantas sabonis, nikola jokic, and now Marc gasol and Anthony davis. And his next few games are lamarcus Aldridge, Mitchell Robinson, Rudy gobert, and then KAT twice (if he’s back from covid). 3 straight weeks of tough learning, but he’ll bounce back soon enough"
Plus multiple shot clock violations on the Lakers.  It was weird. The Lakers came out blazing in the 1st quarter then all of a sudden the Warriors started forcing a ton of turnovers and shit. The Lakers couldn't find anything but anthony davis offensive rebounds and put backs? They kept passing to the open man and missing shots too. Weird ......
"Imagine thinking that the 36 year old LeBron and  Anthony Davis compare to 2 of the greatest scorers in NBA history, and acting condescending about it too. Hardens playmaking is comparable to lebron and their scoring abilities aren’t close"
If you mix victor with Anthony Davis you would get a persona with perfectly proportioned eyebrow
We'll take one Anthony Davis please
Anthony Davis is the Lakers best player. He's the reason they were the champs  Stopping the Lakers comes down to whether u can stop Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis gets a ridiculous amount of calls my goodness
"He went all Hollywood and went to LA just because they gutted their roster to make space for him, and because it’s the Lakers.  That wouldn’t have worked for any other franchise. And helped bully Anthony Davis there.    It’s what I hate most about the nba."
Anthony Davis is just casually fucking slaying this game
Dennis Schroder is completely dicing the Warriors up. Anthony Davis has thrown a few good passes as well. Golden State looks totally outclassed here.
"Best team here tbh.  PG: Raul Neto, Cassius Wintson, Westbrook   SG: Beal, Garrison Matthews, Isaac Bonga   SF: Avidja, Troy Brown Jr., Jerome Robinson   PF: Rui Hachimura , Davis Bertans,  Anthony Gill   C: Robin Lopez, Mo Wagner, Thomas Bryant"
Anthony Davis has requested a trade to the Nets
"Coming into the league, Zion, Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Greg Oden all had more hype than Luka."
Who on this team is guarding Anthony Davis?
"And even if they're not 'slowing them down', Lakers just have a bunch of bodies they can throw at these guys to give them different looks. Literally nobody on the Nets current roster stands even a chance at guarding Anthony Davis for a 7 game series"
There’s maybe one or two players in the league that can legit defend Anthony Davis    And that’s Giannis and Embiid  KD will be “guarding”  AD to 35/15 in this scenario
Agree with everything except Anthony davis was also seen as a generational cannot miss prospect. He was regarded as that level of prospect when coming into the nba and luka was compared to him when luka was coming in.
"the LA teams combining would probably be better, but the NY teams combining would be pretty close behind.  ___  correct me if im wrong cause i dont follow them, but the LA team would be  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Serge Ibaka  ___  while the NY team would be  PG: Kyrie Irving  SG: James Harden  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julius Randle  C: Mitchell Robinson"
"Yeah I don't think it is going to end up a bad class. But there was no Anthony Davis, Karl Towns, Zion Williamson... clear #1 pick. For my own sake I hope Ant can be a Donovan Mitchell type one day, but that remains to be seen."
"&gt; So you think you should trade players who by all accounts are happy?  In some cases, yeah I think so.  Jarrett Allen was ""by all accounts was happy"" and they definitely should have traded him.  I'm sure a good chunk of those Lakers young players were ""by all accounts happy"" and they should 100% be traded for Anthony Davis 10/10 times.  Apparently that's a scorching hot take."
**Eastern Conference:**   STARTERS:  G - James Harden  G - Kyrie Irving  FC - Giannis Antetokounmpo  FC - Kevin Durant  FC - Joel Embiid  BENCH:  G - Trae Young  G - Bradley Beal  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Jaylen Brown  F - Khris Middleton  WC: Zach Lavine  WC: Domantas Sabonis  **Western Conference:**   STARTERS:   G - Luka Doncic  G - Stephen Curry  FC - Lebron James  FC - Kawhi Leonard  FC - Anthony Davis  BENCH:   G - Damian Lillard  G - Devin Booker  FC - Paul George  FC - Nikola Jokic  FC - Zion Williamson  WC: Donovan Mitchell  WC: CJ McCollum  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is what I'm predicting to happen though I think KAT and Ingram both will deserve it over couple of the people mentioned
"I love how Zion takes one dribble and the announcer goes, ""UH OH!""  If Zion gets by most players by 1mm his jump is too fast for anyone to do anything against.  Anthony Davis has had the most successful defense against Zion so far, and he did it by doing something you teach children.  Stay down and stay solid."
"He's 1st in the league in [DFG%](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=D_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100).  His defensive rating is [102](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612747) which is better than Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, and Joel Embid, aka literally every other player except Rudy Gobert listed on Op's all-defense teams.  &gt;He's actually not in the top 20 for DBPM  Wrong he is 17th. https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_advanced.html"
Anthony Davis if he never hit that 7 inch growth spurt in high school
I still think jokic is better because I think he can be a number one on a championship contender while Anthony Davis I think is a number 2.
"Anthony Davis is a better overall player and is only a few months older. The Bucks are, with Giannis as their leader and best player are yet to even make the conference finals. Your argument is just as convoluted as the first commenter on this thread. Id like to see them not get bumped out the 1st or 2nd round before I talk so highly of them."
"Who can say for certain who will win the next few championships. What we do know is that the league is going through a lot of very unique events in a very short amount of time. COVID has forced the league to radically change how they operate - sometimes for the worse, but sometimes for the better. What changes might stick around beyond COVID?  It has been widely speculated that the 2022 draft will be a double draft as the age restriction lowers from 19 to 18, which will presumably create a doubly talented draft class. This draft class will also contain a lot of people who grew up and became basketball players entirely during the 3-pt era. It's possible that we see numbers start to trend upwards league-wide from behind the 3pt line.  Somewhere in the next few years the CBA will be renegotiated. With big stars like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and more demanding trades and making them happen, owners may want the new agreement to help keep stars in one place.   Not to mention Space Jam: A New Legacy coming out this summer. ^(/s)  By the time LeBron retires, the league will be completely different."
"Top 10 NBA players  (in order).   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić.  The Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the NBA."
"If you consider playing next to a great 6th man the equivalent of playing with KG, Pierce, and Ray Allen, then also playing alongside Anthony Davis and LeBron for your other championship is the same thing then there's nowhere left to go with this.  Lowry has, in the last 6 or 7 years had good but not hall of fame talents to work with. The one exception being Kawhi and that team won it all."
Anthony Davis has more 1st Team All NBA selections than Bill Russell.
"LeBron (or a player near LeBron's caliber) never signs with us.  No LeBron means we could trade for Anthony Davis, but does he resign if we aren't competing for rings?  The cards are literally stacked against us and other franchises that aren't free agent destination cities or viewed as ""well managed"" franchises.  Even given the fact the gm of any team like the Lakers is going to be viewed as a talented gm, even though they have all the advantages.  Could the Lakers have been good with Lonzo, Ingram, Hart, and Kuzma?  Bevause if those were the players we had, we couldn't just turn that into a title team with a trade and a free agent.  Our teams will always be built organically or players that take a jump in their game when they get here.  On top of that, it's so easy to get the veterans when you can put together a team like that"
Not every org falls into having LeBron James and Anthony Davis tbf
There’s Anthony Day-to-Davis Now there’s Kemba Week-to-Walker
Anthony Davis is not a tier above Giannis. He is a tier behind. good grief.
the disrespect to anthony davis 😅
"&gt;Tim Duncan is one player, the rest of the team (besides Robinson) was cobbled together by other means.  Yes, the same is true of almost every competitive team. The Spurs would never be a dynasty if there was no draft, that's pretty much inarguable.   &gt;And so what if Zion goes to Boston. How does that change things? The Pelicans sucked with Anthony Davis and they will probably suck with Zion.  The Pelicans got 8 years of AD and get 8 years of Zion. They would get 0 years of any high profile prospect under your new rules.   That does change things.  &gt;And can you explain how the big teams could feasibly sign every superstar with a max or near max contract with the salary cap in place?  They couldn't. They could sign way more than they have now, which would lead to a larger disparity between big and small market teams."
"Tim Duncan is one player, the rest of the team (besides Robinson) was cobbled together by other means.   And so what if Zion goes to Boston. How does that change things? The Pelicans sucked with Anthony Davis and they will probably suck with Zion. Is Boston that much better with Zion instead of Kemba or whoever else they’d have to give up?  And can you explain how the big teams could feasibly sign every superstar with a max or near max contract with the salary cap in place?"
"Giannis will probably win it again if the  Bucks have a good record.   His sidekicks are still trash compared to Anthony Davis, And Harden."
"And before anyone says anything, this is obviously completely unsustainable at this level but still absurd that he's maintaining these numbers 12 games into the season.    He has not suddenly transformed into Anthony Davis but it's fun to see what he's done.    Has there been any other completely out of the blue player who's put up these kinds of numbers to start a season"
"Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and Anthony Davis. All of these players have been considered top 10 in the NBA at one point in their careers. I agree that LeBron is the better player. And that he makes his team better too. LeBron has had help lately too."
"&gt;but he isn't anthony davis  You're right, he's way better"
"Lakers and Clippers are both still scarier imo. Their talent actually makes a cohesive team of two way players and playing off ball, whereas Nets just have 3 all nba iso stars. KD is the most flexible for sure but he isn't anthony davis"
These Stans are funny. They even had the audacity to say that Anthony Davis is doing whatever LeBron is telling him to do. Lol. Bron was kneeling with a groin injury without AD
"Yeah this is it.  Collins needs to learn how to operate in a crowd and has to be able to efficiently put the ball on the floor for 2-3 dribbles to attack strong.  2-3 moves that he can use in that 15 foot ish range and in would change his life too from a financial standpoint.  Right now with Capela not only are his simple PNR/P opportunities limited, they’re less efficient with capela in the lane. There’s nowhere for the ball handler to go with two rolling bigs makes coverage easy.  People are imagining he’s a Christian Wood kind of piece offensively when really he’s a rookie Anthony Davis that can shoot the 3 ball."
It helps to have Anthony Davis too.
"I was gonna say when Ingram basically said he understood why the rumors were there and said something along the lines of “That’s fucking Anthony Davis, of course I’m in trade talks.”"
In all seriousness it blows my mind Anthony Davis is only 27
"Bruh....Bron was the one who started this super team forming shit. Before when we had multiple allstars on one team, the second/third stars were lower tier bench allstars (rondo, pierce, ray allen, gasol, Tony Parker, the entire Detroit team, etc).   Even getting a sidekick as good as Anthony Davis was not seen throughout the 2000’s aside from maybe 2001-2003 Kobe."
"PJ Tucker in shambles right now. He guarded Anthony Davis for them, and for what?"
Time makes people forget. Lebron is playing with freaking Anthony Davis and prior to that Kevin Love/Kyrie and prior to that Bosh/Wade...
Having Anthony davis on your team is not overpowered?
All I know is that if we do get to finals Anthony Davis is going to average 100 ppg
Anthony Davis..... 2020....
Anthony Davis. It's not close.
Anthony Davis is literally the perfect fit and he’s in his prime on top of it. His length and defense also brings a element very few others have. Anthony Davis was built to play basketball lol.
Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis is a better shooter than KG was, though."
"Right, but Embiid didn’t make his debut until 16-17. Anthony Davis has been playing since 12-13."
"[Charania] In a surprising turn of events, the Anthony Davis trade from 2019 has been reversed"
There are a lot of things Anthony Davis won't tell you.
"Well... yes. Right now.  Its important to remember that he is essentially playing straight out of high school. If you look at him on the court, his sheer size and athleticism is startling, even when compared against the top basketball players in the world.  Now picture that same inherent ability being applied against high school kids (or, i guess, watch scouting videos). He would be able to utterly dominate on ability alone, with no need to hone or refine his skillset.  College ball teaches players a lot of things, but in many ways, you can think of it as the first chance for many of these guys to play with and against actual peers. Dominant players have emerged straight from high school (👑), sure, but thats hardly universal. Tough to imagine going from Dave, the 6'4 center who works part time at his dads hardware store, to Anthony Fucking Davis.  He's a smart, hardworking and crazy-talented kid making the transition from being a talented baller to being a skilled professional basketball player. It'll take a bit of a time investment, and some growing pains, but he'll be a positive contributor before you know it."
Anthony Davis has had more shirt changes then Strus made 3’s
Anthony Davis is looking chonky
What a shocker Lakers look like dog shit without their best player Anthony Davis. Let's be honest Lakers aren't a playoff team without AD
Pelicans Legend Boogie Cousins replacing injured Pelicans Legend Anthony Davis
"Lol your entire comment is just about defense, nobody is trying to claim harden is some great defender. He’s about average on that end and good in certain situations, the nets are actually about league average on defense with him on the floor.  They’ve beat every top team in the league. Hardens shot creating and playmaking had lead teams further then Anthony Davis has with his elite defense. There’s a reason hardens been an MVP finalist every fucking season since 2014. He should have about 3 MVPs and has been first team 6 straight times. He’s lead his team to the conference finals twice, should have won a title if Chris Paul was healthy in 18, and only lost in the first round 3/8 seasons. Made the playoffs every single season. He’s been more successful then Anthony Davis and his play has translated to more wins"
The Lakers would have to slide pretty significantly in Anthony Davis' absence while the Sixers finish at the top of the East. Kawhi Leonard could also win it if the Clippers finish first.
Lmao what did Wiseman even do that much for him to be named like he is a scary figure in his second year  Rondo was total shit last year regular season like total useless.  The main difference between last year and this year is Anthony davis played closer to MVP level while this year he is playing like an  all star instead of MVP and now injured.
Yes. Anthony Davis
"I just grabbed one from each team, so some teams end up getting Andre Drummond as their rep and some teams don't get Harden or Anthony Davis shown."
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol. LeBron has been loaded with HOF on his team."
Worked a lot with Anthony Davis too.
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"Players to do it in order from oldest to most recent are Joe Barry Carroll, David Robinson, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Dirk, Anthony Davis, Anthony Davis, LaMarcus Aldridge, Embiid"
"Another thing that I have noticed, that I was waiting for the past few years to see him do much more consistently, is that when he catches the ball he is now almost immediately facing up to the basket. It just creates so much more opportunities for him. For his size he has an insane first step, footwork, and touch. Facing up at 7'2 from 15 feet out just makes him like a more unstoppable Anthony Davis."
"Wait wait wait ur comparing those guys with... ANTHONY DAVIS? When we play without JoJo we are at best a 7-8th seed. AD carried his Pelicans team to the playoffs with some Cardi B rap snacks playing with him. Shroeder was an integral part of the playoff team last year, and so on. Ben Simmons is a great defender yes, Tobias Harris is a good 3rd piece, but if u compare teams and you take out Lebron vs taking out JoJo it’s not a question to who’s team suffers most."
that is not a hypothetical the Nuggets could have dealt Murray and picks for Anthony Davis for 1 year rental.   Davis/Jokic would have won the chip last year no doubt about it. Then Davis would have joined LeBron in free agency this season.   The Defending champs right now would be a Murray-less Nuggets with Jokic and a cast of nothings probably playing in the play in games which may happen anyway because of how inconsistent Murray is.  It was not a great decision they should have dealt Murray for 1 year of AD because that was a guaranteed Chip just like AD/LeBron was a lock for the chip.
Bulls are 18 on offense. Nuggets were missing half of their starters.  Timberwolves are 27th.  Pistons are 23rd. Thunder are 29th.  And clearly you saw we weren't playinh like the number one defense against the Nets. So yes they played bad offensive teams while AD was out. Which explains the difference.   https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/laker-defensive-rating-with-and-without-anthony-davis-this-season  We play roughly the same with AD on and off according to the stats. But if we actually critical think and see that the 7 games AD was gone we played those lackluster offensive teams YOU listed. You'll see a reasoning as to why our defense rating is .1 higher without AD.  Sadly I dont think thinking is your specialty.
no one brought up anthony davis lol
anthony davis seems undeserving

"Anthony Davis has played 23 games.  The Lakers record right there in the sidebar says 22-7.  22+7 is 29.  29-23 is 6! And regardless if I somehow did the math wrong, or the record was wrong, that wouldn't point towards me not knowing the definition of ""literally"".   I see none of you are attacking the actual argument though, I'm shocked."
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"Shaq: “Erneh, here’s the deal. My Lakers and my man Anthony Davis have got a tall... as in, like me... tall task ahead of them. Goin back to back ain’t easy, especially with this short off-season. But like Papa John’s pizza, the Lakers always deliver, and I think if the team can stay healthy, they’re gonna do it.”  Chuck: “What about the Utah Jazz, Shaq?”  Shaq: “Chuck, don’t you F*CKING start right now, man!”  Ernie: “Okaaaaaay then, uh, we gotta go to commercial, fellas!”"
How have ppl convinced themselves lebron is stealing the mvp race lmfao?? The east is so so garbage this year and Anthony Davis is now hurt. Lebron is carrying in the West and doing his normal 26/8/8.
"Anthony ""Back to the locker room"" Davis."
You *sound* like you're trying to be sarcastic but you **are** defending a guy who says Anthony Davis makes his team worse at defense so...
"I can think of an excuse. It's called LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Jazz can reach their full potential but it probably won't matter when they're up against two superstars in a 7-game series. If you don't like what I'm saying, I don't either. But take it up with history."
Hm what were people saying about the nets? Idk maybe that teams would dominate them in the paint. Who were the lakers missing that is a pretty big tall man to help them score more points in the paint? Idk maybe someone named Anthony Davis. It’s not ducking hard to use logic bro
"Any combo? Okay. Here’s three lineups I’m confident could win  Offense:  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson  Defense:  Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Gary Payton  Modern:  Anthony Davis(uninjured), LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo"
Anthony Davis absolutely wrecked the Rockets who didn't have the size to check him 1on1. This Nets team has that same issue. Embiid as well.   Both guys will limit points in the paint to a huge degree too.
"Gobert has gotten a ton of flak offensively and it's not even warranted since his ability to roll to the rim and catch and finish lobs is basically second only to Anthony Davis, plus he's a substantially more active off-ball screener than anyone else in the league except for Sabonis. His scoring game leaves a lot to be desired, he's got below average feel and touch, and his hands aren't great (but they're good enough to get the job done. His overall offensive game, though?? It's really huge."
Is Anthony Davis healthy?
Jfc it’s one regular season game with ANTHONY DAVIS and Schroeder. Like calm bro
"No one brought anything offensively other than LeBron and Kyle Kuzma. The only other player to score in double digits was Harrell, with 10 points.  We need to shoot better from the 3. 26.7% tonight is not good enough.  We were without Anthony Davis, and Dennis Shroeder, two of our top 3/4 players. We definitely felt their absences tonight.  Always disappointed to lose, but on to the next one."
Don't forget Harlan saying:  &gt;I'm still gonna take the length of Anthony Davis
Which one has a bigger drop off? The Nets offense and defense without KD or the Lakers offense or defense without Anthony Davis and Dennis Schroeder.
Anthony Davis leaving still stings huh

"Take the length of anthony davis, Reggie"
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Russell Westbrook 11. Kawhi Leonard 12. Zion Williamson 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kemba Walker 15. James Harden
"CP3 is a lock in my eyes. Has all-star numbers on a 17-10 Suns team, where Booker is not playing at an all star level imo. Same goes for Fox, good but not good enough.  DeMar and Zion are very close, but I would go for DeMar as he is playing great on a better performing team. The Spurs were considered a lottery team to start the season and have done well to start, so it would be nice to see him get the nod. (Plus I'm a Raptors fan so...)  Shai has been really good, but there are more deserving than him, along with Ingram. Both are definitely snubs.  Conley is another tough one, as he is clearly deserving of a spot as he has been the leader and most impactful player on the Jazz, but he lacks the per game numbers to make it. I think with Anthony Davis being out, Conley gets in as injury replacement."
"It’s nice, but the very next pick was Anthony Davis, and look who Anthony Davis is playing with now.  There’s levels to this shit."
"AD did not deserve to be an all star this year. If in any way he got in, it wouldve been only because his name is Anthony Davis"
The best center in the league is Anthony Davis
"I agree but AD goes down, LeBron is the only superstar left. KD goes down, Nets still have 2 superstars. Now, there’s no doubt that LeBron is better than both. But I see the Nets making it at least to the conference finals without KD, merely for the fact that the East is weaker.  Ik things changed a lot since 4 months ago, but can we all agree that without Anthony Davis the Lakers would have for sure lost against the Nuggets, let alone against the Clippers?"
"It’s a long shot, but lebron beating the Clippers without AD is more likely than Harden/Kyrie getting past the Bucks or 76ers.   AD goes down, lakers are still one of the favorites for the Finals atleast  Lebron goes down, lakers might not get past  the second round with JUST Anthony Davis"
"Anthony Davis. No hate on LeBron, but without Anthony Davis I wouldn’t see the Lakers getting to the finals."
"I wish we could’ve gotten Serge instead of Trezz, that Dwight didn’t panic sign with Philly, and that Anthony Davis would sit his ass down and get healthy for the playoffs (looks like that one is finally happening), but those are pretty small nits. Otherwise I’m feeling good.     — Also Bron for MVP."
"Dude, Anthony Davis didn't make any All-NBA teams that season... You know that right? He made 1st team the following year. At least get your facts straight."
Non sense. Anthony Davis made first team last year
Pacific.  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: LeBron James  C: Anthony Davis   Bench: CP3/Fox/Booker/Ayton/Bridges/Draymond
"Anyone who thinks he's an empty stat guy (Hi Bill Simmons) just isn't watching. I have no doubt at this point that he could make up a ""super friend"" group and internally rank them however you want (like Kyrie technically being a ""third option"" or Anthony Davis being a ""second option"" or whatever). But look at the Bulls.. who are the other ""super friend"" guys? Coby White has been ass. Patrick Williams is a rookie who has struggled... Thaddeus Young is a nice player but he's a 25 MPG role player.  The Bulls aren't a ""Zach LaVine just being better"" away from being a contender...  I'm not overly invested in LaVine since I'm about 85 % sure he will likely leave for a better team in free agency so he can be part of a super friend team, it's just amusing how consistently bad takes are on him. You don't score 28.8 PPG on .649 TS% (without even the benefit of superstar officiating) by being some empty stat guy. Any team would be lucky to ad him as a free agent in a couple years."
"Forget about the guards, this era is talented for literally everything.   Point guards like Curry  Shooting guards like Harden  Small forwards like LeBron and Kevin Durant  Power forwards like Giannis  Centers like Jokic and Embiid  All these players will be all time great when it’s all said and done. Curry will be at least a top 2 PG of all time, Harden will be (he’s already) a top 5 SG of all time, KD and LeBron are already both in top 5 of the best SF ever, if not top 3. Jokic is a unique player, one of a kind, and Embiid is an absolute beast. Giannis is a freak of nature, literally built like no one else in the history of basketball. Then you got players like Doncic who’s 21 and is averaging like 28-8-8 or something like that. Tatum is a young stud that might go down as one of the best picks the Celtics have ever done. And I haven’t mentioned yet players like Kyrie (probably the best 1-on-1 scorer ever), Kawhi (one of the best defenders of all time), Anthony Davis, ..."
PG- Steph Curry  SG- Bradley Beal  SF- LeBron James   PF- Anthony Davis   C- Joel Embiid   Decided to keep it current
Is he better than LeBron? No.  Is he better than Kawhi? No.  Is he better than Nikola Jokic? No.  Is he better than Paul George? No.  Is he better than Anthony Davis? No.  Is he better than Luka Doncic? No.  Is he better than Rudy Gobert? No.  Is he a guard? No.  Is he an All-Star? Only as an injury replacement.
He'll be the injury replacement for Anthony Davis.
After Anthony Davis retires LeBron is going to get Zion to join him for some title runs.

Anthony Davis too
Another don't comment from a person who doesn't know basketball first of all Rodman wasn't a bench warmer he was  a great a huge liability on offense he certainly wasn't no Anthony davis  as for kukoc he came on the second 3 peat not the first which had Horace Grant and again he was a good role player but since you seem to know very little about basketball Jordan won with what he was given luc longley was trash go look up his stars before playing with Jordan and his stats after playing with Jordan rand brown was an NBA journeyman actually go look up the numbers that most of Jordans teamates put up playing with Jordan and then go look at the stats before and after you'll see that the majority of them had their best years playing with Jordan Steve Kerr was a nobody barley player then he plays along side Jordan and all of a sudden he's a house hold name that's what Jordan did he elevated his teamates and if you didn't follow he would drag you with him don't come at me with dumb ass statements any please go do your home work first stop listening to ass clowns like Nick wright learn the game
ESPN tomorrow: are Anthony Davis and the Lakers faking this injury so LeBron can win the MVP?
"Bro, they made the 3rd seed with Al-Farouq Aminu as the third best player. And that was the one year that Anthony Davis decided to do something on the pelicans, it was a fluke.   Without kd did russ even make it out of the first round? Yes, he had great counting stats and the media was all on his nuts but maybe go back and watch how Kareem and magic and big o talked about russ. They would know best and all seemed to agree that russ doesn't play winning basketball (in the nicest terms of course)"
I don't watch any more because of the Anthony Davis fiasco. Its objective fact to say that the NBA is a shitty product and an exacerbation of itself.
In order for your analogy to work there has to be a precedent set for Anthony Davis’ worth. So what’s the “dollar” here? What is Anthony Davis’ value?
"They were also 34-31 and on the verge of missing the playoffs in 1994-95, so what's your point? Scottie was really good and it's also disrespectful to say that he only became good because of Michael, but let's not act like he was Dwyane Wade or Anthony Davis.  Nobody for a second of Scottie's career considered him one of the five best players on the sport, he was limited offensively and even when he played without MJ, he averaged 21 ppg on 55% TS.  And before anyone asks, no he wasn't Top 5 in 1994, Malone, Hakeem, Robinson, Shaq and Ewing were all better than him, they just played the same position and therefore couldn't make All-NBA First Team and some didn't win enough games to make into the MVP convo.  The 1994 Bulls were one of the biggest surprises ever, nobody expected them to be that good and they shocked the league, they also came back down to earth the very next season, which is something nobody talks about."
"What a dummy! Even if Anthony Davis played like the greatest of all time in playoffs 2018, he wouldnt win vs KD Warriors."
"Alvin Gentry could be really funny when he wanted to. He responded to the Anthony Davis trade with ""That's a haul, folks"" and shouted ""Fuck yeah"" when the Pelicans got the #1 pick for Zion."
"I'll get downvoted, but I think its wrong to expect parity between organizations and individuals. I think its also wrong to expect parity between individuals and individuals.    Fans are generally fans of teams and not individual athletes. So fans are right to be biased in favor of teams. If the Timberwolves have the opportunity to trade Jaden McDaniels for Lebron, of course the team should take the opportunities even if the players would be unhappy.    I also believe the more talented players are and should be granted more privileges than scrubs/role players. If LeBron wants to trade Lonzo, Ingram, and others for Anthony Davis, yeah, the Lakers should take that opportunit as well even if the players are unhappy.    I have no problem with with James Harden did to get out of Houston. I think he did everything in his power to better his situation and I would have done the same. But I also don't have a problem with Houston fans clowning on James Harden as well."
"Read as ""...an Anthony Davis buffet"" and had a whole ass line thought for a weird movie pitch about a 6'11 vampire who hid his eternal damnation by putting on a fake unibrow and glamouring everyone so they thought he was ill at bball, but really just used the ruse to get other tall men traded to his team so he could feast, ergo Blake.  And being 6'11, the NBA was a perfect source of large meals so..."
"Thinking of college, imagine if you had your college starting 5.   &gt;	Kentucky can roll out a:   &gt;	Fox/SGA/Booker/Anthony Davis/KAT starting lineup   &gt;	With: Bam, John Wall, Cousins, Randle, Murray on the bench."
"Id rather have Anthony Davis, Luka, or Dame Lillard over Harden.  Harden is a fucking cancer to a team, disregarding his skill"
"The major point is highlighting the ascension of Embiid in the post this season.  He's bullying guys down low and getting them into foul trouble.  He's basically saying if you're a big man (6'10"" or greater) you should not be afraid of the abuse down low if you have the size.  They can't teach you how to be 6'10"", but they can teach you footwork and how to bully down low.  He also highlighted how the Lakers bullied teams on the block in the bubble with Anthony Davis feasting on guys.  No teams really had an answer, and to top it off, he could pull them out to the 3 point line and continue to inflict damage.  If you're a 6'10"" big, and primarily looking to shoot 3's, than you're not really helping your team.  I thought the take made a lot of sense, because sometimes you have to play a role that is not your favorite, for the betterment of the team.  Anthony Davis is not a fan of playing the 5, but has done it in stretches, because it was necessary.  It's the difference between being a winner (Lakers) and being a loser (Timberwolves).  What's the point of KAT scoring 30 a night scoring heavy from the outside if the team is still getting beat by 20.  Could he score 30 more from the inside and they only lose by 10?  You're giving up a lot of opportunities to get offensive rebounds when you're hanging out on the perimeter.  That's Chuck's point."
All-time legend Anthony Davis.
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"1. Sign and trades are a thing, the players are usually notified beforehand. And most teams arent high on trading a player, so if they do its either because theyre a bad team fit (Al Horford, Josh Richardson) or the player themselves is disgruntled as has asked to be traded (Anthony Davis, KG, Ray Allen). And if a player has not asked to be traded, their careers are giving a better chance to succeed like we saw in the James Harden, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Lowry, Zach LaVine, etc. trades.   2. Rookie caps are (afaik) to protect teams ~~like the Timberwolves and Pistons~~ from making Joe Smith, Aaron Gordon, Harrison Barnes ass contracts. It sucks dick that players cant immediately choose their team, but as stated earlier they can demand a trade or even sit out games much like Jimmy Butler until they get traded or trades/signings are made to improve their team. I wouldnt mind if rookie caps are repealed, though. They are scaled depending on where in the draft you were taken, so theres that.   3. The fact players cant immediately cant choose their team is that it also gives small market teans (like the Cavaliers and Warriors) a chance to grow their status. If Lebron left Cleveland for somewhere like LA or Boston immediately on draft night the Cavs likely wouldnt be a franchise as of right now.  4. And I'm not entirely sure on this but I believe its possible to get a contract raise if youre already on a contract? I remember Dirk willingly taking pay cuts in order to improve his team but I'm not entirely sure on the other way around.   TL;DR theres a lot of ***nuance*** in these decisions made that make more sense if you look at them beyond face value."
If I recall the last two triple doubles with blocks/steals were Hassan Whiteside and Anthony Davis and there's no way either of them crack 10 assists in a regulation game.
"&gt;I don’t believe in rewarding players who can’t lead their team to the top with the MVP for “narrative/stats""  But this just creates an inherently unequal playing field and incentivizes guys to join superteams in order to receive more personal credit/accolades. How are guys like Curry and Jokic, who have mediocre-bad supporting casts, supposed to lead their teams to better records than someone like Kawhi or LeBron, both of whom have elite talent around them?  It's especially stupid in the case of someone like Curry, who we've seen lead multiple #1-seeded teams and win multiple rings. He *clearly* is a guy capable of ""leading his team to the top"". And he's putting up the best production of his career, but being punished purely because he doesn't have the luxury of playing next to an Anthony Davis or Paul George-type player."
Yet they were hated the most for doing the right thing that Anthony Davis/Kyrie/Kawhi. Is kinda crazy. People don’t want players to have control and do what’s best for them but to choose crappy teams to maintain the balance of the league. NBA fans are super irrational.
"The person who deserved last year’s DPOY is in that list, and by my flair I’m sure you know who I mean  ^^^Anthony ^^^Davis"
My issue is the difference in which the NBA is handling the Drummond situation vs how they handled Anthony Davis when he asked for a trade.  Drummond is purposefully being held out of games due to him being up for a trade. However when The Pelicans tried to do that with Davis after Davis had basically publicly been an asshole to the whole team the NBA forced them to play him for x minutes a night due to competitive integrity.   Also players publicly saying they aren’t happy and want a trade they get fined. Owners saying they want to trade anyone is deemed fine though.   Not saying that players can trade themselves just saying they should be able to state when they aren’t happy.
"Yeah but that also generates a lot of interest. I remember a couple years ago it was Super Bowl week, and sports media didn’t even care. Everything was so focused on where Anthony Davis would end up"
Yeah but has anyone tried giving him Anthony Davis and LeBron James as help defenders?
"Over the past 5+ seasons, Andre Drummond has the best FG% (and second best eFG%) in the last 5 minutes of games that are within 5 points (minimum 250 attempts).  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|eFG%|%Astd| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|249|522|.477|120|286|.420|.592|.410| |2|Andre Drummond|163|289|.564|1|6|.167|.566|.564| |3|Patty Mills|110|253|.435|66|162|.407|.565|.636| |4|Giannis Antetokounmpo|243|451|.539|19|71|.268|.560|.461| |5|Al Horford|175|362|.483|52|133|.391|.555|.806| |6|Jayson Tatum|142|288|.493|33|90|.367|.550|.641| |7|J.J.

"What the fuck is this clown talking about? Drummond was intentionally giving 0 effort on both ends of the court. He clearly wants to be traded out and his thought process was to be a problem in the locker room and negatively impact the team on the court. Draymond has probably watched 0 Cavs games this year so he has no credibility to speak on Drummond and the Cavs. His trade value is already trash if we play him and he gets hurt it obviously puts the chances of moving him at 0%. He also doesn't want to play because it he gets injured he's going no where.  The Pistons are sitting Blake Griffin, the Pelicans sat Anthony Davis... Same shit. Protect the asset as you look to move them. The front office and the player are 100% behind these situations."
"These comments are sad and show a lack of understanding for the business-side of the game. Teams cannot be fined or punished for coming to an agreement with a player to sit them because they are in trade talks, and it is in the CBA that players have certain obligations that we have seen violated in the James Harden and Anthony Davis asking-for-a-trade-publicly sagas. I honestly can’t see what Draymond doesn’t understand here."
It has to be Anthony Davis. Last season’s playoffs was 10% watching him fake injuries while announcers speculated that he might be out long term because of “bad it looked.” Dude stays on the ground crying for bumps that other players don’t even notice
"Because a team sitting out a player doesn't violate its obligations to him, as long as they keep paying him.  But when Harden refuses to report to the team in order to force a trade (which is the crux of the issue here), he is violating his obligations to that team.  &gt;when guys like James Harden and Anthony Davis give 60% effort  Perfectly legal. As long as you don't behave unprofessionally (and that includes leaking trade demands to the media), you're free to half-ass games to your heart's content and I wouldn't say a thing.   But that's not what Dray is saying here. He's directly speaking about players sitting out, publicly demanding trades and generally being douchebags while violating the terms of their contracts."
Anthony Davis
I feel like we only lose if we are playing the Finals favorite (or Anthony Davis lol). I like our chances vs anyone else lol.
"I disagree. It's not a double standard or treatment of the players. In fact, players get away with a lot of shit, The Anthony Davis saga or the James Harden saga shoudn't have happen.  A player shoudn't be able to say ""I wanna leave, oh you won't let me go then I'm gonna show up out of shape, tank my value, boicot the team, play like shit, complain to the press, complain to my teammates, etc"". Yet, they do, and the only punishment they get is people talking shit about them.  Team pay a ton to have those players, and they have the disadvantage that if said players doesn't want to play anymore he can sit and the team is unable to fire him because they lose big time if they do something like that. Teams should be able to say ""we're moving from you, we'll find a deal that works for us"" and that's the end of the story, because they're the ones putting a lot of money into you to be a professional. That being said there are things that should change, like players shoudn't learn about them being traded during a game, or a random interview, or on Twitter, but they SHOULD be criticized and heavily punished for doing stuff like the Harden or AD things, yet they don't."
"Anthony Davis’s agent publicly requested his trade, which is a “violation of a collectively-bargained rule prohibiting players from making public trade demands”.   Basically, instead of privately going to his team to request the trade, Anthony Davis made this request public which breaks the rules and undermines his relationship with the franchise"
"I love Draymond, and I get what he’s saying about pulling Drummond from games, Barnes being told he’s been traded mid-game, etc. Fully agree that players should not have to deal with that bullshit. The Drummond news is especially strange, Idk if I’ve seen that before.  But as for the comparisons to people criticizing James Harden, Kyrie, and Anthony Davis, I don’t see it. Those guys weren’t criticized for requesting trades or because their mental health was off. They were criticized because they didn’t handle their situations professionally, straight up. I don’t think you can pull those stunts and be free of punishment/criticism.   Player empowerment is awesome, but those guys handled their situations poorly."
Therein lies the problem that Dray is attempting to expose. Why is it acceptable for teams to do this for the reason that you stated but when guys like James Harden and Anthony Davis give 60% effort for teams they’re not committed to anymore it’s the end of the world?
Anthony Davis
"Liked your original call of Klay but the more I think I’ve decided it’s gonna f up everybody so just give me a crazy athlete that can catch lobs. I’ll take Anthony Davis currently. All time it’s Shaq, still too big."
"Why do people say this shit lmfao. If either of LeBron James or Anthony Davis weren't on the team, the Lakers wouldn't have won the championship and this point is moot."
"&gt;Lakers really have the most unfair advantage in the league. The most preferred free agent destination for players(rich people)  This is largely a myth.  Very little of the Lakers' dominance is due to free agent acquisitions.  There's LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal, but to-date, those two only combine for 10 seasons in Purple-and-Gold -- and only five of those seasons are noteworthy here -- and both of those guys were not shy about signing with other teams too.  On the list of best-Laker-free-agent signings, you reach Kurt Rambis a lot faster than anyone would think.  The Lakers drafted Magic Johnson, Jerry West, James Worthy, George Mikan, Elgin Baylor, Vern Mikkelson, AC Green, Clyde Lovellette, Gail Goodrich, Norm Nixon, Michael Cooper, Vlade Divac, Nick Van Exel, Jim McMillian, Derek Fisher, Andrew Bynum, Marc Gasol, and many others.  Plus K.C. and Sam Jones who declined to play for them and went on to win 8 and 5 titles in Boston.  The Lakers traded for Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, Byron Scott, Anthony Davis, Pau Gasol, Bob McAdoo, and a raft of others.  Want to win like the Lakers?  Draft and trade like they do, and players will want to play for your team, too."
Anthony day to day davis is back on the menu&gt;?
"I want to know why Anthony Davis is being held down and spanked in the Kentucky locker room. Like, why in the world is that happening and being recorded?"
That's like saying Anthony Davis is close to being the #1 best player in the NBA just because he's a top 10 player.    There's a large gap in talent in the top 15 players and the lower tier guys like Simmons.
"All teams with Lebron end up looking like the Cavs. If Anthony Davis doesn’t come back , it’s going to be a short post-season"
"Ewing was about maybe a Anthony Davis before the 2020 playoffs level player, probably a bit worse. Never had any real argument to be in the top 3-5 players in the league, but was consistently low top 10. My first comparison was a PG13 type player but I he was definitely better than that, so somewhere between PG13 and AD, but I don't think there's any player who is firmly in the middle of that right now"
"&gt;The Lakers are plus-9.1 per 100 possessions with James on the floor, and minus-4.4 when he rests -- the second-fattest on-off gap among the major candidates, trailing only Embiid. That sustained during the Lakers' slide without Anthony Davis;**the Lakers are plus-20 with James on the floor since Davis went on the shelf, and minus-31 with James on the bench**, per NBA.com  jesus fucking christ"
"The article highlights what any smart basketball fan who has watched the Bucks for years can see:   - Giannis is much more devastating as a play finisher than as a play creator, especially in crunch time situations at the end of games.   - Giannis on a championship team is a lot more like Anthony Davis than he is LeBron.   - When Giannis is the play creator on the team, he's a 7-foot Westbrook, which is an incredible player, but one that's got glaring flaws that will be exacerbated in a playoff setting.   - Bucks are better off letting Middleton and Jrue make decisions with the ball in their hands in late game situations than Giannis, Middleton is the best bucket gettor on the team, and Jrue is the best decision maker on the team. Middleton is the 2nd best decision maker on the team.   - The existential question for the Bucks now is are Middleton and Jrue good enough to be your primary creators on offense on a championship caliber team? Will Jrue Holiday be more aggressive on offense when it counts like you could argue he needs to be on this team? 2 player comps I would make, is Jrue Holiday is smaller Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton is smaller Kevin Durant."
"First, name me the person in his era who averaged close to what Wilt did during those early 60s.   2nd, I said Wilt was almost as impactful defensively when matched up head to head as I’ve shown earlier, and a far superior offensive player.   3rd, compare the offense of the Warriors before and after drafting Wilt and tell me if he was impactful or not.   Let’s say you have a great defensive player say... Draymond. Draymond is the anchor on defense and when he plays, Warriors defense is elite, probably the best in the league. You compare him against someone who’s a great offensive and defensive player, say Anthony Davis. In their first 2 playoff matchups, Draymond and his team wins AD’s team, sweeping them twice en route to 3 rings even though AD had the better stats by far. Does that make Draymond a better player?"
"this is so stupid. the Clippers could have continued sucking. NOLA got better because they drafted... Anthony Davis and then... Zion.  Houston went from 55 wins to 65 which is extremely difficult to do. To go from a really good team to elite. that jump is extremely difficult to make.  you guys did improve drastically come on you lost PG, Russ and Grant. last years' squad was pegged to be the worst team in the league and it was further justified when you started out 0-4.  this is all just dumb."
"You are something else man.   &gt;Iggy had a higher TS% percentage than Curry  You think other people can't look this shit up?  They had a nearly identical TS%, 58.5 vs 58.8. Damn, ""Iggy"" had 0.3% higher TS? Holy shit, totally deserved FMVP.  What was the usage? 30% for Curry  vs 19% for Andre? I see.   Since we are using TS% let's compare LeBron's that series... oh, 47.7%? He must be a scrub then I guess. Curry's was tied with Andre for highest TS% on the Warriors, LeBron? **6** Cavs had a higher TS%.  That must mean those guys were better, right? Or is TS% not a great metric to use?  What about the per game counting stats?  Curry 26/5.2/6.3 1.8 steals.   Andre 16.3/5.8/4.0 w/ 1.3 steals.   They played very nearly the same number of minutes.   If LeBron is such a great carry guy why did the Lakers miss the playoffs before trading for the Laker's **real** MVP, Anthony Davis? He got really lucky with the groin pull because he was getting exposed! He needs talent to win (like all players).   You put LeBron on THIS Warriors squad and they wouldn't even be in the playoff race. At least Curry is a shooter that has been respected once he steps across half court, with LeBron there would literally be **zero** spacing.   It's clear you are a hater and just looking (and failing!) to come up with any little excuse you can to tear down Curry. Your feeble attempts fall as flat as your pickup lines at the local single bar."
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
"The Only Team to beat the Brooklyn Nets+Drummond  PG- Stephen Curry  SG- Marcus Smart  SF- LeBron James  PF- Domantas Sabonis  C- Anthony Davis   6th Man- Jarrett Allen  7th Man- ALEX ""The GOAT"" Caruso"

Anthony Davis got selected for the US Olympic team before getting drafted  Also KAT was really good as a rookie
Meanwhile Anthony Davis
My point is that free agents do go to LA. It’s ridiculous when laker fans complain that no one goes to their team when Anthony Davis forced a trade to la and free agents are constantly signing with the team.
I think Anthony Davis serves better as a small ball center 🤔
"Same reason Anthony Davis couldn't carry a team despite being All-NBA caliber.. He and Steph are great basketball players, but they arent ***GREAT***, feel me?"
Exactly they need to replace Anthony Davis for furkan kormaz!
"Yes he’s a negative on defense, but on a team like the Lakers who are a top 10 defensive team and when he would be covered by LeBron James and Anthony Davis instead of Lonnie Walker and DeMar DeRozan I highly doubt his defense would negate his offensive value at all.    Do I think the Lakers would be better giving lamarcus Aldridge touches in comparison to giving them to Wesley matthews, markieff Morris, Marc gasol etc.? Yes, without a doubt yes.   You can argue he’s a worse fit for y’all if you’re only valuing defense, but he’s without a doubt a better player than gasol"
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat*
" The 12 man team will probably be: Steph curry, Damian lillard, lebron james, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis as the starters.             Kyrie Irving, James harden, Paul George, kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson/bam adebayo off the bench.             Chris Paul, Bradley Beal Jason Tatum to round out the roster. I don’t think Chris really belongs here, but I think he’ll make it anyway because of his locker room presence and reputation. Tatum can be swapped out for a lot of players here, but he’s my pick to make it."
"James Harden, Anthony Davis. The list will keep going on and on."
"How tf did you get all of that from me calling Dwight the better lob threat and pnr partner lol?   You said  &gt; Lol what on earth is Dwight doing without the ball  And to answer that, he’s doing much more infact. Joel is good at lobs but Dwight is an all time great lob threat, many even consider him the best. Not to mention one of Embiid’s biggest knocks is that he isn’t a great pnr big, something you don’t have to even think about with Dwight. Shooting is great but when you’re taking 3 threes w gane ...  And yes lol, DeAndre Jordan is the better offball center, with the ball Joel is a million times better, but you don’t even know the wonders guys like DeAndre Jordan, Shawn Kemp, Amare Stoudemire, and Dwight do for their PGs. Joel is good but you’re hyping him up like he’s Anthony Davis or Kristaps Porzingis off the ball"
"Anthony Davis, he's got a case for the best player, obviously top 5 without question, Lakers are the 3 seed rn"
I’m sure Derrick Favors is going to lockdown Anthony Davis and Jokic.
"""Mavs allegedly would trade KP for Anthony Davis or Lebron James or both"""
"Apparently Danny Ainge doesn't want to win another title so you didn't have to sweat, he will sit on assets for the rest of his life while the Celtics get bounced in the second round again.  If anyone thinks that this Celtics squad as its is constructed right now can win a title, they are insane. Boston is Portland in the East, with the difference that the Celtics had opportunities to turn their assets in players like Anthony Davis or Jrue Holiday."
"I mean c'mon he was on a team with dwade and bosh in their primes, with all nba players kyrie and love, and now with mvp caliber Anthony Davis..."
"Luka easily had a better team around lol. That's insane. We started wenyen fucking gabriel in the playoffs last season   You've probably never heard of him. You know, because he was a rookie we picked up from the G league who has played a grand total of 247 minutes in his entire career  And **we started him against anthony davis in the playoffs**  Meanwhile Luka got injured against the clippers in one game and his team erased a 20 point deficit in one quarter with him on the bench"
"This is a bread and butter move of so many wing players/big men who like face up and drive from the elbows. I think Anthony Davis does this a lot, Chris bosh used to do it too."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"&gt; Elite Big men still have value as much as an elite playmaker  Do they though?   If building a team from scratch, wouldn't everybody rather have James Harden than Anthony Davis?"
"Anthony Davis always wanted to go to the Lakers, that is pretty clear. He seems to have disliked what happened with IT as well, but it's not like he ever wanted to go to Boston before that anyways. Having his dad's statements come out when they did was helpful for his goal of going to LA because it publicly eliminated a team that was in the trade market for him and forced the Pels more towards doing what he wanted."
I don’t disagree but the more important thing than fans and the media thinking this is if players and the general nba believes this about him   Anthony Davis apparently did. I have no idea if the rest of the nba does or doesn’t my guess some do sure. But regardless don’t think this is worth worrying about that much. Having some people think “Danny doesn’t care about his players” whether it’s true or not is a lot better than being stuck with Isaiah Thomas’s busted hip and giving him a big extension

"&gt; Yeah I trust a guy in Mitchell who averages 27 a game in the playoffs  You trust a guy that has been bad in 3 of his 4 playoff series?  &gt;I also trust Gobert who is one of only three guys in the league today to have a net rating of +18 or better per 100 possessions in the postseason for their career, the only other guys being Kawhi and Anthony Davis. The fake ass narrative that Rudy gets played off the court in the playoffs is so lazy  Net rating is a terrible way of measuring impact, especially per 100 possessions lmfao.   Two consecutive first round exits, including a 3-1 choke."
"The only issue I have with this is it focuses too narrowly on an individual. When the team is what really matters.  Perfect example: Kyrie. Maybe Kyrie makes this list on his own. But we’ll never know because LeBron came back. And it’s like...maybe that counts, as Kyrie was a talented enough player to lure LeBron back. But without LeBron the odds of those Cavs teams doing anything was pretty slim.  Then look at Carmelo. In 04-05, he was the top scorer, but had the lowest Win Share of the starters and worst Vorp. He was at .5 compared to 2.6 (Camby), 2.0 (Miller), 1.8 (Martin), and 1.7 (Boykins). Even 34 year old Byron Russell had a higher Vorp (.7)  Obviously Melo being there let the other guys thrive. I doubt if you take him out the team is suddenly stronger. But it wasn’t just drafting Melo that made the difference.   I think that’s the case with most of these guys. The odds of a lottery pick = playoffs has more to do with the rest of the team than the pick. There’s probably a world where Brandon Ingram ends up with Embiid in Philly and is on this list while Simmons gets Luke Walton’d then traded for Anthony Davis.   I think circumstances matter more than this analysis allows for."
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"Yeah I trust a guy in Mitchell who averages 27 a game in the playoffs  I also trust Gobert who is one of only three guys in the league today to have a net rating of +18 or better per 100 possessions in the postseason for their career, the only other guys being Kawhi and Anthony Davis. The fake ass narrative that Rudy gets played off the court in the playoffs is so lazy"
Currently playing? 1000% Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis. The best example in the league probably. He can be your anchor on defense, but his offense is consistent of PnRs and Iso scoring. Which is great during the playoffs which is why he elevates during the postseason but isn’t good during Regular Season."
"Their development was sacrificed for the bigger goal of a championship  Russel and Randle were traded or let walk in free agency so the lakers had money to sign Lebron + another star (which happened a year later)  Ball and Ingram were traded for Anthony Davis  Lebron + Davis &gt;&gt;&gt; development of Russel, Randle, Ball, and Ingram"
"Woah, with a haul like that, how did they ever miss out on Anthony Davis?"
Rob Pelinka is a genius dude. He got LeBron to come and got Anthony Davis to demand a trade to one team.
"Not saying Dame wasn't good, just wasn't necessarily seen as a top 10 guy  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/nba-top-100-players-2016/  https://www.si.com/nba/2015/08/25/top-100-nba-players-2016  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2684404-2016-17-nba-superstar-rankings-top-25-players-heading-into-the-new-year  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank6_2016/nbarank-6-new-orleans-pelicans-forward-anthony-davis - this one dame's top 10 fair enough  &gt;Draymond had the pleasure to play with two all-time shooters. I'm not discounting Draymond, he's good, but he works well with other stars and thats an argument against him. Most teams would rather have Dame over Draymond, even in 2016  He was a consistently DPOY-level those years captaining the Dubs elite defense and was one of the key initiators of their offense as an elite passer, not just kickouts to shooters like u say but leading their transition attack and passing on the short roll to bigs/cutters/shooters in steph/dray pnrs (he was even a passable scorer/shooter). obviously dame's a better floor raiser but i guarantee most contending teams at the time would rather have had dray than dame. warriors dynasty wouldn't have happened without dray, not even close-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkLmR3ka4Mo"
"Anthony Davis is also a really good rim protector, something the Nets need"
Anthony Davis in the 2020 Playoffs felt like he was shooting 60%.   He was 57% from at least one part of the mid.
"I mean, if your options are trading them for peanuts or drafting a cost controlled pack of peanuts, whats the difference? They've traded away some picks pretty flippantly, honestly. Trading Desmond Bane to get off Kanter's $5m contract sticks as a recent example.  He did get greedy. He kept all of his assets for one of two trades; Paul George or Anthony Davis. The George one he got done in by awful timing, thanks to Isiah's injury. If he was all-good, they don't have to trade for Kyrie to address that issue and can instead re-route more assets elsewhere, meaning they wouldn't have had to put the eggs in the Hayward basket and wait for him to sign, effectively taking them out of the PG market.  Then Anthony Davis just rightfully didn't want to come. Ainge didn't get stingy, he just took a big risk to hold out for the star and then when that star didn't come... the whole league knew the position they were in and NO ONE would take the picks for more than 20cents on the dollar.  This is just what happens with promising young teams with lots of assets, man. You can be so prepared and have all the assets but it's still so hard to take that team to the next level... promising futures fizzle away so often. You need lightning to strike to be great, and it just didn't with this team, despite Ainge standing outside waving his lightning rod around."
"You could ask the same question about Anthony Davis as he got replaced as well. I guess the idea is that Booker was considered more worthy than the replacement, hence he should still be considered one."
"Athleticism does not mean prime. The combination of fundamentals, IQ and athleticism is when player is in prime. Anthony Davis  will dominate for a long time."
"The Clippers are Kawhi and a bunch of knuckleheads.   The Lakers are LeBron, Anthony Davis, and a bunch of knuckleheads."
"Danny “almost traded for prime Westbrook, prime Blake, PG-13, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden” Ainge"
"If you look at PER or win shares, lebron doesn't even belong in the conversation.  And then take into account Lakers have been ass without Anthony Davis so how valuable can anyone else on the team be??"
Why is Anthony Davis an all star then?
I just want to point out the actual title of the article is:  &gt;Lakers trade deadline preview: How defending champions can fortify around LeBron James and Anthony Davis
"The exact same could be said for why Anthony Davis’ career accomplishments read 2021 all star. Why name an injured player to the all star team? Just as AD deserved to take the spot, booker deserved to take the replacement spot."

It's hilarious this is the narrative now when people here were saying we needed to make a deal done for Anthony Davis and not wait for him to come in Free Agency because LeBron was running out of time and getting old.
Anthony Davis admitting he has no control over what clothes his people tell him to wear solidified that idea to me.
"LeBron James: No years at college.   Kevin Durant: One and done.   Anthony Davis: One and done.   Carmelo Anthony: One and done.   &amp;#x200B;  Works both ways, really."
"It’s essentially the same list as the best players in the league.   LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden, Luka, Giannis, Jokic, Embiid (this season at least)  That’s in no particular order. All the best players are also the best offensive players except a few random ones thrown in like Gobert. Even Anthony Davis, who is considered a great player but not necessarily a great offensive player, is in fact a great offensive player. Before this year when he was coasting/dealing with wear and tear, he was averaging like 27 games n 60% TS for the last five years. That’s so good."
"All right I'll bite but only because Mitchel&gt;&gt;Lavine is such a hilarious take. Mitchell and Lavine are somewhat close so there's some room for disagreement, but you are saying things like ""insane that people have such a high regard for Lavine"" and ""he's by far the worst"".  Basketball is a team sport. There's only so much 1 player can do unless you are a top 3 player. The same thing was said about Anthony Davis back in the day. The same thing was said about Booker, and now the Suns have the second best record in the NBA. The Bulls just have a bad/young roster. I don't know how any sane person can watch the Bulls play and think Lavine is not an incredible player.  Mitchell is averaging 25/5/5 on 55 TS%. Lavine is averaging 29/5/5 on 65 TS%. Once again, no sane person can watch those guys play and think the Bulls would be better with Mitchell. Mitchell has some great games (Lavine has just as many though), but the difference between 55 TS% and 65 TS% is enormous. 55 TS% is very **in**efficient for a volume scorer and 65 TS% is insanely efficient. I think a 28 ppg season on 65 TS% has only ever been done once or twice (Curry/Harden) but Im not sure on that."
"Anthony Davis + LBJ is a super team. That’s arguably two top 5 players, a claim very few teams in NBA history can make."
"Devin Booker, Anthony Davis, and some other players had their ""homes for sale"" a while ago, it doesn't correlate much. I wonder what the actual success rate is for a news story of a player's house being sold and them within the season"
&gt;Anthony Davis: Good athlete  Lmfao
anthony davis looked like his parents fucked a tree that was related to them
"&gt; Everyone is cool when lebron teams up with Anthony Davis lol   At one point our roster was LeBron, AD, Kuzma, and Jared Dudley. That’s it.  And no, no one was cool with it.  &gt;but suddenly when kd and kyrie recruit harden it’s unfair.  Why would it be unfair?"
"Ah I see, well Anthony Davis should be the MVP of that criteria"
"How the fuck is Anthony Davis in there? What the fuck did he do?  And who the fuck is this ""Norwitzki""."
The difference is irrelevant here. The Lakers would not have won without Lebron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers could not have won without Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
No. There definitely isn't. Please go ahead and look at their stats and make an argument.  This is like saying Klay Thompson is a better player than Anthony Davis in the 2010s (pre Lakers).
Anthony Davis is a lock too
"I don’t think Andre Drummond, a player nobody wanted to trade for in the first place is going to be the defensive difference for a team that has Anthony Davis...  I’m not knocking Drummond, he is great at what he does well. I’m just saying I don’t think getting Drummond improves yall to the point where “it’s a wrap”. It’s just about AD and LBJ’s health."
"New Orleans fans should be the ones complaining about being screwed. If we don't win the lottery for Anthony Davis, we have to build around Eric :Fuck New Orleans"" Gordon."
You are incorrect about Drummond in cleveland sir. Every time he touched the ball he went rogue and tried to cross up his defender and shit. Sometimes would refuse to pass to a guard after a rebound and take the ball down the floor himself. He's awful at everything except rebounding but he thinks he's anthony davis.
Lebron&gt;harden  Anthony Davis&gt;kyrie   So no
Lebron is playing with Anthony Davis lmaooo wth
"Because when superstars go public with their demands for a trade, the team makes it happen   See Kyrie Irving 2017, Anthony Davis 2019, Paul George 2019, Russell Westbrook 2019/2020, James Harden 2020..."
"His rebounding will be valuable, maybe give us second chances points  We need an athletic rim protector but who’s out there that can give us that? Unless mcgee is let go and even he was unplayable at times during the playoffs. We have Anthony Davis Vogel has shown he can make adjustments when needed, Drummond will be great for us"
"Yeah he's worse in the playoffs. That's not surprising.   Literally every player that's the only star on their team drops off. Dame reason Harden does  There's only so much you can do **when literal G-league players are starting for your team in the playoffs*  And yes, I'm using literally properly. Go look up Wenyen Gabriel - you know, the guy who has played less than 250 minutes in his entire career who we called up from the G league to start against Anthony Davis"
"It's a bit different in the NBA (and North American pro sporting leagues in general) as the teams that are bad will either be rebuilding or in the ""directly before rebuilding"" stage where they will either have young talent on the roster or be in a position to draft highly the next young wave of talent and give the fans hope for the future, as opposed to soccer where bad teams just stay bad forever unless some billionaire oil oligarch buys the team and throws a bunch of money into the team.  There is a bit of a ""soccer-ization"" of the NBA where it's starting to feel like even if you do draft good young talent, there's a strong possibility they will just bide their time until free agency and then join up with some other star players to form superteams and leave their original team in the dust.. but at least it seems like the teams that become the superteams switch up every few years... so I guess there's hope that your team can become a superteam by making your team attractive for free agents... It does make it difficult for teams in locations that are very unlikely to ever have that kind of cache (Orlando, Sacramento for instance) and of course there are teams that can do everything wrong as an organization and still be a marquee destination anyways (Lakers signing LeBron and Anthony Davis forcing a trade there) so it's still not perfect."
Oh so now we’re at the point in history where Lebron stans undervalue Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh lmao. Can’t wait for another 6 years where they will act like Anthony Davis was just another guy.
"Pierce and KG were 31, Ray Allen was 32. Sure all were still technically in their primes but on the tail end of it.  LeBron was just entering his prime (26), same as Bosh and Dwyane was smack in the middle of his (28).  Then he teamed up with a young superstar in Kyrie and brought in a prime K-Love, recruited Rose and Dwyane as well.  Then moved to LA knowing full well superstar Center Anthony Davis was going to be there.  He basically admitted he uses All-Star games as a recruitment day for potential teammates"
"&gt;How many superstars are gonna stick it out in fucking Charlotte? Or Cleveland. Now how many LA Superstars have left LA (before their careers were virtually over)?  O'Neal left Los Angeles -- not by choice, but had he not, Bryant would've, so that's one either way.  Chris Paul went to and from LA.  Dwight Howard went to and from LA.  Not that many superstars actually change teams before age 30.  Leonard did it twice.  James did it once.  Chris Paul did it once.  Durant did it once.  Davis did it once -- if he's in that class.  Carmelo Anthony did it once.  Dwight Howard did it twice.  O'Neal did it once.  That's about it, going back 20 years, and most of those were trades, and some quite expensive.  Maybe not in Charlotte, but Westbrook, Lilliard, Curry, Thompson, Antetokounmpo, Gobert, Simmons, Embiid, Beal, and others appear to be ""sticking it out"" in non-LA/NY markets.  Gasol stuck it out in Memphis.    &gt; Guys like Horford and Redick are sought after, but they aren't the marquee players that are like ""LA or bust.   No, they aren't, but Erving and Malone were.  Erving even left his hometown for Philly -- the Knicks made an offer, but the 76ers outbid them.  &gt;Any city outside those 3 needs to pray for a generational talent to fall in their laps and try to build up a roster around them.   You don't need a ""generational talent"" to win a ring, and you sure as hell don't need one to be competitive.  Miami doesn't have a generational talent, and went to G6.  Toronto didn't have a generational talent, and won a ring.  San Antonio did not have a generational talent in 2014, and won a ring.    &gt;You're not getting a generational talent if your team can consistently get the 7 or 8 seed.   You have to pick one here.  Either you use ""generational talent"" properly and it refers to LeBron James only, or you mean something else, in which case you have to include players like Antetokounmpo.  And he was precisely available to such a team -- Milwaukee went 38-44 and got swept by the Heat in the first round, and subsequently drafted their 2-time MVP.  Denver went 36-46, then drafted their franchise Serbian."
Pretty sure he knows he's not better than Lebron and Anthony Davis 🤦‍♀️
"Copying my comment for the other thread of the same topic:  Looked it up to make sure, but it seems the difference was that Anthony Davis wanted to play ([Source](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/2/8/18217106/anthony-davis-bench-play-pelicans)). You can’t sit out a healthy star player that wants to play, but if the Thunder and Horford come to an agreement that he shouldn’t play then there’s nothing wrong with that. Anthony Davis still played less than he usually would have tho."
"Looked it up to make sure, but it seems the difference was that Anthony Davis wanted to play ([Source](https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/2/8/18217106/anthony-davis-bench-play-pelicans)).

Same reason why Aaron Gordon wasn’t fined for requesting a trade and Anthony Davis was.
"Yes, which is why I acknowledged that I was probably biased. Basically, we are both thinking of different versions of Anthony Davis and we can both be correct when we say that he is or is not a top 10 player."
"Yeah everyone says Gobert gets played off the court but the only year he averaged less than 30 MPG in the playoffs was his first year in it when he only played 10 seconds before spraining his knee against the Clippers. That was the year that Curry made him a shooting star meme so everyone kind of just gathers their opinion off that  In his playoff career, he has a net rating of +18 per 100 possessions, which is higher than pretty much every superstar in the league today (Harden +11, LeBron +14, Giannis +10, Embiid +3, Dame +6, Jokic +15, Durant +12, Curry +11, CP3 +15, Paul George +7). Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only other top players I can find in this search with a +18 per 100 in the postseason. The Jazz just never had the offense to keep up with Houston, and then last year they didn't have a reliable backup behind Rudy.  Rudy didn't get played off the floor, Tony Bradley did lol  For what it's worth, Donovan Mitchell is -7 per 100 possessions in the Playoffs. He did play a lot with the 2nd unit in those Rockets games, though. We were desperate for scoring"
Anthony Davis?
"It isn't even because it interferes with the tank that much, Al Horford isn't Anthony Davis. They'd just rather develop their young players."
Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
id like to hope front offices are adapting. Anthony davis didnt leave new orleans for nothing. They had previous picks and a couple rookies. They did it all like a ninja. And grabbed williamson to boot.
"Explain to me how player literally not trying on there former teams and then all of a sudden after not dunking in 2 years they're dropping hammers. You think Aldridge has been playing hard ok San Antonio? Fuck no.   Just like Anthony Davis before he went to the Lakers. This whole ""I'm not gonna try at all and just sit here and collect my pay cause I'm a big baby and want to play somewhere else despite knowing this is what I signed up for"" bullshit has to stop"
"When it actually matters, Anthony Davis is playing all those center minutes anyway."
You think Drummond is going to post up when he's on a team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
They have Lebron and Anthony Davis they aren’t getting swept
As a Nets fan I welcome anyone who wants to play for the team but I was hoping we could have landed Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler and Anthony Davis and Embiid and so on....
Lebrons teams have all been “super teams” as well. Lebron wouldn’t have won in Miami without all stars Wade and Bosh even Ray Allen. He wouldn’t have won in Cleveland without All Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and he wouldn’t have won with the Lakers without All Star Anthony Davis.
"Max contracts are precisely the problem. Tobias Harris and Anthony Davis got basically the same contract lol. Same with Embiid and Wiggins, Ben Simmons and Jamal Murray, etc."
You mean he’s gonna have fun watching anthony davis guard those guys. cuz trezz will not be matched up against them for extended periods in the playoffs.
Anthony Davis would like a word
"If LeBron James and Anthony Davis lead the Lakers to the finals and then a win over the Nets, James is the best to ever do it."
"""A player"" != ""Davis"".  That was an example to illustrate the point.  But if you cannot understand that, here's a more concrete illustration.  On [January 27th](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202101270PHI.html), Davis went 0 for 3 from the arc, in a 1-point loss to the 76ers.  He also went 9 for 15 from inside the arc, so each of those missed threes was a gift to Philadelphia.  That's not even to mention the knock-on effects, such as how much hanging out at the arc reduces Davis' offensive rebounding utility.  There is no earthly reason why Anthony Davis should be down around 40th in the league in ORB%, barely ahead of Jae'Sean Tate."
Today I learned that 28 year old Anthony Davis is the only one who played for the Lakers and Heat last finals and therefore it was pre-determined that he would injury his achilles
When did Anthony Davis dick him?
Getting dad dicked by Anthony Davis really changed him. Dude's been taking care of his health.
"But for current day:  Starters: Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Rudy Gobert  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Julius Randle, Nikola Jokic"
"Starters: Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Bill Russell  Bench: Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Scottie Pippen, Pau Gasol, Ben Wallace  I feel like this would be a fun team that would work really well together chemistry wise, and be efficient on both ends with good spacing"
"Drummond struggles against the bigger and more physical centers not the smaller ones. He can do things similar to how he did on Saturday when he can seal his man and get an advantage. [Example](https://twitter.com/alexmregla/status/1384189790069788674?s=21). I’m literally showing you examples of what they CAN do. But you’re stuck on he’s just a bad finisher which is true without realizing he can have a similar performance finishing to Saturday, because he is getting much more favorable matchups. [Thing like this will happen](https://www.nba.com/lakers/video/teams/lakers/2019/10/17/2843038/1571281817881-anthony-davis-lob-javale-mcgee-2843038) , because AD is grabbing the defenses attention and drawing defenders."
Mate Jaren will be fine. The Grizz are protecting their young star. If it was Anthony Davis you wouldn’t bat an eye
Heaps of high profile NBA players still wear Kobe shoes (e.g. Anthony Davis) - wonder what shoes they have migrated to  Watched the Spurs vs Pacers highlights but couldn't identify Derozan's new sneakers
That's not bringing up win-loss record. That's saying shooting percentage isn't the only stat that dictates if someone is playing well against someone else  &gt;Which is why Anthony Davis has a losing record against Rudy Gobert? Lmao  That's you bringing up direct records. Not me
Anthony Davis dominates Rudy Gobert*  *When Rudy Gobert is forced to guard another center and Anthony Davis has LeBron James on his team
Which is why Anthony Davis has a losing record against Rudy Gobert? Lmao
Lakers without Lebron seem to do fine... plus they’ve got a fairly handy guy named Anthony Davis that might argue with you...  Warriors without Steph would be competitive with Klay and Draymond (not to mention last time they were competitive they also had KD)
"I feel like he would be less susceptible to them if he actually got into a defensive stance and moved laterally as he has pretty quick feet. he plays defense very upright, one of the only times I've seen him get into a stance and get low is when he guards anthony davis lol"
[Frank Vogel says Anthony Davis got some “good work” in today after the Lakers’ morning meeting. Vogel says AD will ramp up over the next couple days and could make his return in Dallas on Thursday.](https://twitter.com/mcten/status/1384301044939726855?s=21)
Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins
"Dude harden put up 30 and 8 on 65% TS while being doubled lol, imagine if he had someone who could even produce *close* to his level, like imagine harden/gordon/cov/PJ/embiid or giannis or something, that would be a way better series. We already were up 1-0 and had a lead in game 2 until russ decided to be russ Teams like us get stuck with shitty “stars” like russ while your team gets lebron and then Anthony Davis smack in the middle of his prime begging to play for you. You need to just realize you guys had it way better then anyone else did"
"Maybe he’s not top 5. He’s top 7 at the very least. Assuming Lebron is your #1, Anthony fucking davis was by far the best #2 in the league. I mean we had russ averaging 17 and 4 on 40% TS while being left open and being useless on defense and you still have lakers fans shouting about how duos are what’s right lmao"
We won because Lebron James and Anthony Davis are unstoppable offensive players.
If Anthony Davis makes it over him I’m gonna laugh my ass off
I just hope they give it to Anthony Davis or something so we can go back to collectively liking each other's guy and hating the right people again.
"I don't feel like anyone ever seriously questioned Ingram, more just ""if you can get Anthony Davis you flip Ingram for him in a heartbeat"" - which was and is true.  And D'Lo kind of still is what everyone said he was - more of a volume scorer who can't defend and doesn't make his teams better.  Randle is the only one of the 3 who vastly exceeded everybody's expectations.  But even that, in fairness, is only because Randle completely revamped his game.  The concern on Randle was always that he played more like a dinosaur.  Which, kudos to him, but it's not like the Lakers themselves ever saw Randle shooting 40% from deep or averaging 6 assists a game.    We will see on THT.  Lakers fans were really high on Hart and Kuzma too, and neither one of them have really improved much over the last 4 years."
"In terms of names, LeBron James, although this is partly because of how often he's changed teams, although most of them were after their primes. Chronologically:  * Carlos Boozer * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Rashard Lewis * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Shawn Marion * Isaiah Thomas * Derrick Rose * Rajon Rondo * Tyson Chandler * Anthony Davis * Dwight Howard * Marc Gasol * Andre Drummond"
A better scorer than the most dominant scorer ever and Anthony Davis? I can’t get on board with that😂
List of players Durant has played with but left off the list:  - Lebron James  - Anthony Davis  - Kobe Bryant  - Chris Paul  - Steve Nash  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Carmelo Anthony  - Tim Duncan  The absolute shade he's throwing here^^^^/s

Here’s the lists I made:  KD had:  Russ  Prime Ibaka  Young Harden and Prime Harden  Curry  Klay  DPOY Draymond  Kyrie  Iguodala    Lebron had:  Kyrie  Kevin Love (who was still good in his first couple years with Cleveland)  D-Wade (mostly injury prone Wade but he had prime Wade for an entire season)  Chris Bosh  Prime Anthony Davis  6MOY Montrezl Harrell  6MOY Candidate Dennis Schroder  Ilgauskas (who was a 2x all star)  I honestly don’t know who had more help
"We saw how that turned out with Jimmy Butler, he got them to the 8 seed but it wasn't pretty.  Unless KAT somehow turns from a negative on defense to a DPOY-level guy who anchors the best defense in the league, he can't play the Anthony Davis role."
"Everyone should look at efficiency average with a grain of salt. To give an example, average player on GSW shot around 60% TS with Steph on the court. Does that indicate that they're less volume and as efficient as Anthony Davis? No. Modern NBA has inflated role players TS% with improved analytics and offensive schemes, but you still need guys who are high volume players that can be at least average."
I absolutely hate Anthony Davis. Fuck that guy
We see what happened with the Suns as soon as they got CP3. You need that guy who demands excellence from everyone.    Everyone knows how good KAT is on the floor. I haven’t honestly seen him push for greatness as a teammate. Maybe he’s not that guy.    Maybe he needs to play the Anthony Davis role. He might always be the most talented guy on any team he plays but finding a real leader on that team has been unsuccessful so far.
This team is basically the pre Lebron Lakers team my guy. Add an Anthony Davis to the shopping list.
Anthony Day-to-Davis
Anthony Davis or Giannis.
Anthony Davis and Dennis
Anthony Davis is the best fit for basically any star
"I think a dominant big is ideal for Luka, so I would pick Anthony Davis or Embiid."
"Anthony Davis, he pairs perfectly with every elite guard in the league, Luka, Dame, Harden, Kyrie, Curry, all of them. A pick and roll with those two would be unstoppable."

Anthony Davis - 1 Day-to-day status per season
"&gt;I'm pretty sure both parties in the trade knew AD was going to re-sign with LA  No.  &gt;Whether or not the Pelicans trade Anthony Davis, his agent says he [won't sign a contract extension with any team](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-celtics-anthony-davis-trade-one-year-rental) and plans to enter free agency in 2020.   &gt;   &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   &gt;   &gt;“Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.”   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Not to mention, if you don't trade for AD there's no guarantee he comes to LA as a FA. KD+Kyrie could have recruited him, among a number of other teams   This insinuates that Davis is the key to building an NBA team.  He's not -- or the Pelicans would've made the playoffs more than twice in his seven seasons there.  And again, there was no guarantee that Davis signs with Los Angeles five months ago in any scenario.  He was an unrestricted free agent, and his agent literally screamed to the entire world that he was going to test the free agent market.  &gt;I don't think you can necessarily assume the Lakers win the title last year without AD. DG and Markieff probably don't come to LA if they don't have AD. AD was a key part to that run and   I said ""probably"", I did not assume.  That said, their chances were very good.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Caruso, and Morris is by far the deepest and best team in Orlando.  And that's if they don't decide to make a different trade -- the Lakers could've traded for Jimmy Butler instead of Davis, and the former went for pennies in comparison.  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench dominates the bubble, and wins easily -- and the Lakers maintain most of the assets they blew on renting Davis.  &gt;I doubt BI+Lonzo could have made up his production on offense and defense   Those are only two of the seven players the Lakers traded away in that deal.  Eight if you count Zubac who was traded separately to make room.  Ingram alone last year nearly matched Davis' offensive production, so your only argument is on the defensive side -- but Ball is better on both ends than Danny Green, and cheaper.  Like I said, the Lakers probably win the 2020 title without Davis.  James has won with far less help."
1)Stop the recency bias it’s clearly the one in DPOY talks. 2)Anthony Davis is a better defender then both when healthy(just a bias statement that’s factual)
"Towns is better, he’s in an Anthony Davis type situation where he’s been a part of losing teams but if you paired him with another star his team would be dangerous."
Simple. He is Shaq in a league who's rules deny a Shaq even existing...probably because of  ....Shaq! You ever wonder why 25 years ago any player like Anthony Davis would instantly produce 50 wins?  The league and the rules changed
"Superstar players with rosters this bad in the West would be dreaming of even the 9th seed. Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, KAT, their excuse has been working with awful rosters for years and they never got W's. Curry this year has a roster that might be worse than any of them ever had and they're scraping at playoffs."
&gt; Ramona seems cool as hell tho.  Just dont ask her about Trade Caps or Deals involving Anthony Davis.
Lebron James injured.  Anthony Davis injured.
Anthony Davis is a better all around basketball player than Giannis
"Curry is still all time great in the playoffs. He has the 3rd best TS% in the playoffs in NBA history for 20 PPG scorers behind Kawhi and Anthony Davis (who has played way less playoff games Tehran Steph or Kawhi). Among 25 PPG scorers in the playoffs, AD is the only one with a higher TS%."
"&gt;If I recall AD forced his way to the Lakers  You don't recall.  &gt;Davis, [speaking to reporters](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096800664951369733) as part of his All-Star media availability, confirmed the previously reported list of [Milwaukee Bucks](http://bleacherreport.com/milwaukee-bucks), [Los Angeles Lakers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-lakers), [Los Angeles Clippers](http://bleacherreport.com/los-angeles-clippers) and [New York Knicks](http://bleacherreport.com/new-york-knicks) is ""true."" When asked specifically about the Boston Celtics, though, Davis made it clear they are a contender for his services.   &gt;   &gt;""They [are on my list](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1096802063315546112)...I never said Boston wasn’t on my list,"" Davis [told reporters](https://twitter.com/VinceGoodwill/status/1096802751617646594), before repeating the latter sentence when asked for clarification.      &gt;   &gt;""All 29 other teams are on my list,"" Davis later [said](https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1096810453437538305) on NBATV. ""I don't have a preferred destination. I just want to win. Big market, small market, I don't care. I want to win.""   &gt;   &gt;[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots)  &amp;#x200B;  Davis was traded to the Lakers because they offered the best package for him -- in fact, they offered the best package ever offered to rent one player for one season.  &gt;Morris was bought out just like Drummond was this year  Wildly different situations, actually, so your memory has failed you again.  Morris was practically making minimum wage, and still, no team wanted to trade for him.  A number of teams also could have claimed Morris off waivers, since his contract was so small -- but they all declined.  Quite a bit different from Griffin and Aldridge, as well."
"Y’all not gonna guard him either way, because Rudy gonna have to deal with Anthony Davis dropping 30 on his head. Drummonds still eating"
"Lol definitely not. Harden has played with all time gets in Russ (twice), KD (now twice), and Chris Paul at least. You're gonna need more than that to argue why he should've won 3+ STRAIGHT. The last 3 peat was done by one of the greatest teams of all time 2 decades ago. If you think giving Harden just one healthy Anthony Davis would equal a 3 peat or more you think he's like a top 5 player all time Lmao. He has Kyrie and KD now which I think we can all agree is better than getting just AD and is about as good or better than receiving Klay and Curry. So what now? Do you think the Nets will win the next 3 chips or more? If you think his problem was just teammates that roadblock is gone now, no?"
Can we please not refer to Andre Drummond as “AD” while he’s on the same team as Anthony Davis?
"I get upset when people try to pretend folks like KD, Harden, Anthony Davis, and others are better than Curry. He is 2nd to LeBron and that's it!"
Anthony Davis’ mid range is butter
"The Rockets had no chance against the eventual champion Lakers though. No chance. You know what happened? They ran into the potential greatest player of all time, and they played LeBron James and Anthony Davis without a center AND with a post-covid Russ.  Like, sometimes you just run into a team that’s head and shoulders above."
"He played three years at LSU, but comparing age in their first NBA game, he was only a year older than Anthony Davis was (next oldest on this list). I don't know how, but he was 17 for most of his freshman year so he was only 20 when he got to the NBA."
"Drummond was insane in high school, for a while he was #1 in the class above Anthony Davis. He played point forward on his team and you can still see his quickness/agility for his size, easily a freak athlete even today:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXB6vc5Z\_A4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXB6vc5Z_A4)"

"&gt; Because James Harden is better than him.   there is room between ""Worse than Harden"" and ""low end top 10 player"". nobody is taking Anthony Davis over KD"
"I'm here to watch my favorite players Lebron James, Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis and Mike Conley. Hope it's a good one."
"Anthony Davis is a baby back bitch and is a LeBron nut slurper. You seriously telling me a team of AD, Zion, and Jrue Holiday couldn't be considered a threat for a chip?"
"Lebron is shoes MAYBE is 6'9. He was listed 6'8 his whole career untill 2 years ago.  If Lebron is 6'10 in shoes, then KD is 7'1. It's that simple. You can see that there's a big difference in height, even more on shoulder height that brutally affect the standing reach.  In fact KD has a 9'2"" standing reach.  Lebron? 8'9.5""  Kawhi 8'10""  Zion 8'7""  To make it clear, Anthony Davis has 9'1 standing reach, just to understand KD ridiculous length."
"He didn't suck on offense. He was basically a more athletic KG (with a worse jumper) with better outlet passing and solid offensive teammates most of the time so he got to quarterback a lot. Roles were typically more segmented back then as well. He grabbed 20 plus rebound basically every single game. His playoffs averages are 16-25-5.   He probably averaged close to ten blocks per game for stretches!  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/430859-bill-russell-the-greatest-shot-blocker-of-all-time  He had rodman's rebounding and defensive dominance, plus all-time level rim protection AND was a top-tier passer. He was probably more athletic than Anthony Davis (definitely more durable).  His defense is way better than simmons, his rebounding and leadership are multitudes better. He is again, like a more athletic KG.   So in general, his offensive game was really good while the rest of his game was all-time level excellent.   Plus, he never lost a win or go home game from high school up."
You guys didnt watch Anthony Davis in the postseason last year  He can do everything
"You realize AD scored less and less efficiently against Jokic in the WCF than he did against Bam in the Finals, right? The whole premise of that point is wrong. Nobody was a match for the Lakers, who btw crushed the team that beat the team that brutally swept Embiid. And the Sixers were +6 with Embiid off the court lol.  When Jokic gets taken out he’s replaced with defensive specialists, and whenever he’s out they play a primarily defensive unit with Jamal or MPJ or someone. Look at the nuggets bench and realize that the guys replacing him are all 1-way defensive players.    No intelligent GM is taking Embiid over Jokic in the playoffs. He has junior varsity court vision, is horrible at taking care of the ball relative to his assist volume, and is awful from the field. His shooting splits have been trash all 3 trips and that’ll keep up when teams trap him, like Brooklyn did a few days ago, because the only thing he knows how to do on offense is try and score. He might score 30, but if it’s at league average TS% and he can’t get his teammates involved, it’s a winning formula for Philly. Jokic always dominates in the playoffs, teams haven’t been able to play him off the court. It’s also very normal for teams to use defensive specialists on certain one-way possessions at the end of games when they have timeouts to spare, again, a total nothing comment.   There’s not a single data point, not a single one, that has him as a bottom 10 defender. That’s completely asinine. His rim protection numbers are better than Anthony Davis the last two years, the standard for starting centers (not PFs) is just really high. Embiid isn’t even an elite rim protector the past few years."
"Seems like father time still has no shit on lebron then considering this guy is still dropping 25-8-8 like its nothing until solomon hill decided to dive and break lebrons knee. Also it aint just lebron, did you forget we also have prime fucking anthony davis?"
To be honest man I don’t follow the NBA to closely so don’t take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he’s my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that’s why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis

"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
"It’s the opposite, Jokic’s average defense is worth way more because it’s harder to field an average defensive center, there just aren’t many who can do it. That’s why players like Bismack Biyombo are even in the league- teams are willing to have black holes on offense if it prevents them from getting absolutely torched (being unplayable) by big men and at the rim. Jokic has proven he’s a playable defensive 5 even in the playoffs. Jokic is a bad rim protector compared to *starting NBA centers*, but he’s as good or better than “elite” defensive PFs as a rim protector, like Anthony Davis and Robert Covington. His rim protection numbers have been better than Anthony Davis’s for the past few years:  https://imgur.com/a/6HZBV7y   That’s the best illustration I can think of for how much lower replacement value is for centers than other positions on defense (so average D is worth more)."
&gt;I still can't believe they made that trade  They made that trade to clear room for Anthony Davis.
"He played in 76% of games last season and was healthy for 86% of the games last season.   He's played in around 66% of games this year and will most likely hit around 70+% by the season is over.   He's not the epitome of health, but it gets really overblown. Last season he played the same amount of games as Kawhi Leonard, and more games than Joel Embiid. He was only 5 games less than Anthony Davis and Nikola Vucevic.   The same folks that hate on him in /r/mavericks are the same so-called therapists and body language experts who are analyizing his body language and claiming that because he didn't go make out with Luka after his game-winner that he was somehow upset that he didn't get the last second shot and is a cancer to the team."
God that Pelicans roster is disgusting  For some reason they had a starting lineup of:  Anthony Davis  Dante Cunningham  Norris Cole  Bryce Dejean-Jones  Omer Asik

"Eh. Warriors current record is more reflective of the rest of the team than Curry. Without curry’s injuries and missed games, the warriors are currently neck and neck with the blazers for the 6th seed, with the blazers having a tougher schedule. Russ won MVP as the 6th seed. Also funnily enough if you compare the win percentage of warriors record this year with Curry and russ’s mvp record, their winning percentage is nearly the same with Russ having a little over one more win. You’re acting like Steph is getting special treatment. He’s not. He’s simply a top 2 guard and therefore is deserving of all nba first team. It’s funny how so many ppl forgot anthony Davis got all nba first team as the 10th seed but now are whining about how Steph is getting special treatment"
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."

Anthony Davis in 2017 as a 10th seed
I'm going to say Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis.   You guys need defense and versatility.
"Anyone who thinks that Westbrook is a better player than prime bron because he got more mvp votes should just put the phone down. You clearly have no clue what you are talking about and it shows.  Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way (and it needs to be said).  &gt;AD  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2840691-rich-paul-told-celtics-anthony-davis-would-only-play-in-bos-until-2020-if-traded.amp.html  Rich paul himself told the Celtics that AD was a rental. Rich paul is ADs agent. I know it’s tough, but try to piece together what that means about what AD thought.   &gt;not seven picks  It’s 3 picks and 4 swaps, therefore potentially 7 nets picks. Stop arguing semantics because you are losing an argument.  &gt;the best player.  Houston didn’t value a player based package. They valued picks. If they valued players, they would have taken a Ben simmons package, and as we know, Ben Simmons is significantly better than anyone that the lakers traded."
"Nah, you just don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re a fool if you think Anthony Davis is on the same level as Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant as a scorer."
"&gt; Bron was the consensus best player in the world at the time.   Not to MVP voters, and not for the better part of a decade.  &gt;Are you really going to argue that AD was fine with Boston?

ESPN: Anthony Davis bullies balding man for wearing conspicuous hat.
"I thought that was an interesting Stat to bring up.  Anthony davis: 58% off assists this season  Jokic: 51%  Curry: 40%  Talen Horton Tucker: 37%  Zach Levine: 36%  LeBron: 33%  So are we also saying Curry isn't a ""self creator"" or ???  Jokic?  Maybe anyone other than Luka, no super star is a self creator because only 10% of Luka's shots are from assists."
"Only down by 12 points missing the best player in the game, Anthony Davis, Andre Drummond, and Markiff Morris = a Win in my book"
"It's pretty easy to recognise this.   Golden State with Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are an unstoppable juggernaut.   The Lakers without LeBron and Anthony Davis would not even sniff the playoffs.   You add the right two players to the worst team in the NBA and they're championship level.  Unless you're proposing an achievable pair of additions that will transform the team, then the statement is basically meaningless."
Nah you right - his jr year he was hyped as a once every 3 years offensive prospect; Zion/Anthony Davis got more hype but he was is a tier below them
"1. The Suns rose after AD got injured, then Lebron got injured too. The Lakers are a top seed that fell down the standings. This is the only situation where the Suns would have such a tough first round opponent having finished second in the West.   2. The Lakers have played like that in most games all year. It was a really quick turnaround from the finals to the new season starting. Anthony Davis was injured in the Finals last year and didn’t come in ready for the season, Lebron looked better but he’s known for pacing himself then ramping up for the playoffs. They knew they had to win this game but they didn’t want to have to play their best to do it. They ended up doing just enough. Expect more effort and intensity especially to start over the next few weeks.   Talent wins out most of the time. The less players there are playing the sport, the more talent matters and the more influence one person can have on the game. Having 2/5 players being superstars makes the game much easier.   3. I’m assuming this is because players still score even when the defender does everything right, or can still miss when a player does everything wrong. I don’t know what other sports you follow but the fact that basketball has such high scores means that there are a lot more opportunities to score than in other sports. Therefore the best defense results in no attempt at scoring. Unfortunately a lot of the actions that lead to no attempts aren’t easily captured by stats (outside of the obvious blocks and steals).   There were times when Draymond was hounding AD so well that the Lakers didn’t even throw him the ball, or he didn’t even attempt a shot. Against another defender AD would likely take a lot more shots and get more touches. But the only way to see that is by watching the game.   Look at Steph as well, he had a lot of turnovers which is obvious but it was much harder to notice that he went 3/3 from three in the second half. Great right?! He shot 100%. No, he only took 3 threes. That’s great defense."
"Anthony Davis is young, elite, on a contender this year, already has a ring, and could have a lifelong career with the NBA’s most popular team. I take him."
Maybe the Lakers should have an asterisk next to last year's title since Anthony Davis was traded from a bad team to pair up with a GOAT.
What about that Anthony Davis guy?     His team should get the old asterisks treatment.      Or Evan Fournier.      It's inconceivable.
Don’t forget Anthony Davis falling down every three minutes and getting poked in the eye every game.
"1. Lebron and Anthony Davis were injured for dozens of games and their record tanked - many have them coming out of the West despite the 7th seed. Suns are a very inexperienced team with their best player Devin Booker never reaching the playoffs until now and Chris Paul being notorious for having early exits  2. Not really wrong but there's only like 10 superstars imo, with 2 of them being on the Lakers. Basketball is a very player-dominated sport due to it being a 5v5  3. Idk what you mean but people say defense wins championships, and its not wrong. Most if not all of teams that got chips had amazing defense"
18/19 - no AD. No coronavirus  19/20 - with AD. Coronavirus   Anthony Davis caused Coronavirus confirmed. We got em.
Anthony Davis made the playoffs 2 times out of 7 in NOLA. Good night.
"Explain the Kings, Magic, and Detroit for the past.... oh lets make it an even 10 years.  Hell, I'm a Hornets fan and recognized what the Bobcats were doing to get Anthony Davis..  .... only to end up with MKG (not horrible, but not AD)"
"I swear, I hardly play basketball, but even I know that in most of anything past JV, it’s a game of putting your head down and worrying about the next possession no matter the score. You trust the coaching to guide you, and, unless you’re some fucking high IQ superstar, you try your best to execute.  Somehow many fans don’t understand that, even when the stats about how teams play are right in front of them. Even when star players haven’t played in weeks, they manage to shut their brains off for the first two quarters and forget that it’s Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  Like, guy, give these guys some time to warm up. It’s a joke that you can’t wrap your head around those simple facts."
There is no Anthony Davis in that clip. Shit there isn't even a laker
"Right, but again last year Wenyen Gabriel was started an entire playoff series, being asked to guard Anthony Davis. And Hezonja also received significant minutes."
"&gt;AD got away with a ton of moving screens  Which one?  Anthony Davis barely bothers to set any, since he wants to be a 3&amp;D wing apparently.  Andre Drummond's screens can be questionable, but he doesn't set that many, and teams obviously sag off him that far from the hoop anyway, so they aren't very effective."
"Anthony Davis on my team, other teams, Donavan Mitchell"
"Curry is a terrible defender ask Kyrie in the finals , there’s a reason Klay would guard the best guard because curry is a liability on defense. The west was much weaker this season with all the injuries , Donovan Mitchell , Jamal Murray, PorzinGod , Lebron, Anthony Davis. Curry is better than Lillard yes but his numbers will see a big decline when Klay is back m. He’s not the mvp point blank period ."
He literally outplayed Jokic so bad when they faced H2H. AD doesn’t let people shoot like 70% at the rim either.   Jokic: 21.8/7.2/5.8 on 53/35/85  Anthony Davis: 31/6/3 on 54/33/91  And that’s not even considering the fact that AD is a completely dominant force on defense while Jokic lets opponents score a absurd 65% at the rim
"On a sidenote nba.com and espn both list Looney and LeBron at 6'9"" now.  Anthony Davis is still listed at 6'10"".    Is AD really only an inch taller than Lebron?  what's up?"
Anthony davis isn't top 5 I'll give u the other stuff tho
Why are there takes like this.   I feel like people who say things like this have never even played a pickup basketball game. Like you can possibly imagine being late in the 4th quarter where you've defended Anthony Davis all game and are just trying to gather the energy to stop LeBron from dunking and not have your hands be in the direction he is leaping into. It's unbelievable.
"??? ANthony davis scored the most  on the lakers. Its Ad and Lebron vs Curry by his self. Curry 37, lebron 22. haha outplayed. classic"
"Anthony ""leprosy"" davis"
No one is confusing anthony davis for Tom Brady in any aspect
"Switch Anthony Davis with Dryamond Green, or throw Klay Thompson back in, and we'll see who daddy is.  Edit: Or drop both anthony davis and draymond green and we will see who daddy is."
I heard that Anthony Davis guy is pretty good
"nowhere in the video is a clip where anthony davis intentionally fouls curry and is completely confused when the ref doesn’t call it... were you just presuming people wouldn’t watch the vid you linked or something? at 1:07 Davis tries to block Curry after falling for a pump fake. it looks like he may have got curry on the arm, but it also looks like he may have got mostly ball. but Davis certainly isn’t “completely confused when the ref didn’t call it”... no idea where you got that  i mean the video you linked speaks for itself. curry absolutely DOES get mauled more than any other player off-ball. but you don’t gotta misconstrue shit to make that point"
could u imagine anthony davis falling on u lol

"&gt;Why has he not played in so long?  Hip Injury  &gt;Why is getting DNP’s?  Hip Injury  &gt;Was he not promising?""  Still is. Hip injury.   &amp;#x200B;  [Article from yesterday:](https://sports.yahoo.com/warriors-lakers-4-key-questions-180143370.html) ""While the Lakers have been dealing with injuries to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Warriors have been rolling with an eight-man rotation due to Kelly Oubre Jr., Damion Lee and **Eric Paschall** being sidelined..."""
"Bro this happens even when they're not trying to intentionally foul. Here is a clip where Anthony Davis intentionally fouls Curry and is completely confused when the ref doesn't call it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td7Z36BfU7U (1:07)  If you watch the part at 1:45, you'll also see AD foul Curry on the 3 pt shot attempt and ref admitted he didn't call it because Curry made the shot. This shit is comical."
Davis is perfectly willing to play the 5 in the playoffs. He said it again the other day.   This isn't an Anthony Davis thing. This is a Frank Vogel thing. I have no earthly idea why he decided to stay big for so long.
That's because Vogel stopped fucking around and played him at center. Anthony Davis is not a floor-spacing four.
Six years is a long time in basketball years. Six years is the difference between Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic
Lmao alright my guy I look forward to seeing you bitch and complain about calls all series bc god knows Lebron fucking James and Anthony Davis don’t have what it takes to beat y’all
"No I just am saying how the Lakers bent their defense a lot more to stop Curry than the Warriors bent theirs to stop LeBron.  That bending of the defense leaves openings all over the court, however the Warriors shambled roster wasn't able to take advantage of it well enough, which is the reason it's a viable strategy in the first place.  Had Anthony Davis been one of Curry's teammates; he would've been getting a LOT of free dunks out there (which would not show on the stat sheets as assists for Steph despite creating them btw). If Klay Thompson is out there, that's a lot of wide open threes.   Unfortunately it is JTA, Jordan poole, Kevon looney, Kent Bazemore, Wiggins trying to finish those opportunities. They were almost able to do enough but not quite"
It's not just Anthony Davis at center as much as its.   One more non shooting big allows teams to clog the paint which doesn't let AD and Bron cook
"wish i'd saved the clip from the third, but Caruso literally turns and puts a forearm into a warrior player at half court in what I'm generously gonna call a screen. No call. But that Draymond screen was called. That's just rough. Let's not talk about the one on Anthony Davis, with minimal contact as well. Two illegal screens in the 4th on Draymond but Caruso got a pass cause why? As a Neutral Sports fan in general that got a bit suspect by the refs in the second half"
"While I'm spewing hot takes Anthony Davis is too fucking rich to still be so ugly. Do something with your face, man."
Same with Anthony Davis in corner
"Make no mistake, Anthony Davis played like an absolute pussy for most of this game. But also Draymond Green was incredible defensively.   Steph Curry and LeBron James are basketball Gods.   I haven't liked Dennis Schroder for a single second this season, he was playing for the Warriors tonight.  Alex Caruso is a fucking dog. I love him."
If your curry you can't be behind Anthony Davis with 1 second left before you get a 5 second call. Whatever the play was you have to improvise something else there.
"Warriors offense worked well in the 1st half. Until Anthony Davis learned how to play basketball again, momentum shifted."
Anthony Davis now DAY-TO-DAY with a sprained Ankle.
Anthony Davis standing still and curry jumping into him isnt a foul bud
Steph Curry was the best player on the floor in a game with Lebron and Anthony Davis. Utmost respect
Better than Lebron James and Anthony Davis
Curry spent the last two Warriors possessions throwing himself at Anthony Davis and turning the ball over
Anthony Davis is such a bitch. Idk why this dude gets so many calls
"""Credit to Anthony Davis getting to the shooter"" - I just wish they called out flopping lmao"
"""Anthony Davis discarded people"".  What a quote."
When Anthony Davis yells he sounds like Vin Diesel yelling about family in any fast and furious movie
Anthony Davis literally just threw someone to the ground to get the rebound.
Anthony Davis throwing people to the Shadow Realm like human javelin.... no whistle.
Is Andrew Wiggins outplaying Anthony Davis? Am I just way too hyped on Wiggins trying?
LeBron really needs Anthony Davis and the refs to beat an 8th seed.
The day Anthony Davis accepts that he should play the 5 if he wants his team to perform at their best.    So... never?
ANTHONY DAVIS
"Anthony Davis falling down, and refs helping the Lakers. Name a better duo of better duos."
Can’t believe the Lakers are this good with Anthony Davis at center. No one saw this coming. Absolutely ridiculous
I hate Anthony davis this guy can eat the warriors anytime down low but hes just hanging at the 3 point line being ass
Is Anthony Davis ever aggressive?
I’m always amazed by Anthony Davis’ shoulders.
Imagine if Anthony Davis had Melo mentality
Is Anthony Davis hurt? Why isn't he being aggressive and driving to the hoop?
Looney outplaying Anthony “Bubble Boy” Davis
Anthony Davis plays like a black Kristaps Porzingis
Anthony “karl anthony towns” Davis. That boy soft as hell
"Anthony Davis built like Tim Duncan, but bricking threes/playing on the perimeter will always be funny to me."
perhaps anthony davis should guard the rim?
Anthony “Top Five Player” Davis looking real sharp tonight
“As Anthony Davis takes another three” sounds so much funnier than it is lmao
Anthony Davis your trash
Anthony Davis just jacking 3s like the guy that hangs around the courts calling we got next all day
Anthony Davis out here playing like Anthony Bargnani
"Siakam’s done bad in clutch time, has worse defence, and is less efficient. Yes, Anthony Davis is on the hook if he continues playing bad, but those two players are on different levels."
One more half for Anthony Davis to prove that Draymond Green is not in fact his father
Id pay money to listen to Chuck roast Anthony Davis
man anthony davis getting smoked
"lebron was 1 for 7 in the first half, DAMN... and Anthony Davis was 2 for 12"
Anthony Davis playing like a ruffle
It’s way too easy to get into the head of lebron James and Anthony Davis lol. Draymond eating them up
Anthony Davis needs to shave that nut ass unibrow and start hooping. 5 points at half tf
Anthony Davis being used a stretch 4 right now... remind me again why this team has 3 other centers?
Imagine having LeBron James and Anthony Davis and getting embarrassed by a bunch of G Leaguers.
Is Anthony Davis basically tall Harden
Why couldn't Anthony Davis play like this last finals??
Anthony “Settles for the Jumper” Davis
Anthony Davis getting bullied by Draymond lol
Anthony Davis finally had more shots made than eyebrows
Seriously. I thought they T'ed him up for embarrassing Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis about to fake an injury
No way is Anthony Davis a top 5 player
Anthony Davis is garbage
"6 of Anthony Davis' 9 field goal attempts have come from outside the paint. He has missed all 6.  That is what we call in my language, soft."
"Davis had a below league average TS% in the 2018 series. They made him work super hard for his shots. Still scored a lot ofc, because he's Anthony Davis and he took a lot of shots. But making him work is the point.  Is AD scoring easy tonight? No. Though on average he'd shoot much better than tonight, this isn't some amazing mu for him."
"Anthony ""DeMar DeRozan"" Davis"
Anthony davis pulled an hassan whiteside got paid then started on playing like ass
Do Anthony Davis and LeBron James scissor?
"Anthony ""Marshmallow"" Davis"
"“Move outta way Lebron, KCP, and Dray. It’s my turn to yell at the refs” ~Anthony Jeffries Davis"
Anthony Davis going for an all time lowlights video so far 🔥🔥
"LOL Not really, we got Giannis, Jrue, Middleton for the next 4-5 years at least, so I'll keep enjoying it. We don't need a super team to be great. Lakers were a joke before LeBron got there lol and even that first season with LeBRon was a joke. Got bailed out with LeBRon and got bailed out again with Anthony Davis, only because of LeBron. LOLOL!!!"
"Lakers would still suck if LeBron never came there. Talk your shit but the bucks would have also won a championship if they had Shaq, Kobe, and now LeBron to bail you guys out lol Lakers didn't reinvent the wheel or anything so sotp acting like your above other fans becuase you got a mickey mouse ring with LeBron and Anthony Davis lol. Franchise is a joke, carried by a couple great players."
I didn't call anyone mentally weak. I understand playetrs not wanting to be there given the situation and what else was going on in the world. That doesn't make a person mentally weak. Now you are just making shit up and putting words in my mouth lol Enjoy your mickey mouse ring and LeBron bailing out your franchise. You guys would still suck if LeBron never came there. You had LeBron and Anthony Davis in the bubble. Doesn't take much effort to win a ring with those two in an already not ideal situation lol
They’re like Anthony Davis. Owned their shortcomings and put it all on their shoulders for game 2.
His tag is Jay-Z overrated... can you imagine the amount of real estate that Anthony Davis takes in his head? I bet his burner account is ADOvrrted...
Anthony Davis had one of the best playoff runs for a two way player last decade and everyone forgot about it 3 months later. People are more and more like goldfish
The Anthony Davis technique
You missed a bunch:  Giannis had 31/13/6/3/1 in G2.  Anthony Davis had 34/10/7/1/3 in G2.  Bradley Beal had 34/4/3/1 in G2.  Deandre Ayton had 22/10/1 on 85% shooting in G2.  Devin Booker had 31/1/3 in G2.  Kawhi had 41/6/4/2 in G2.
&gt; Who hits the floor more than this 7 foot beast.  Anthony Davis
The good news: this Grizzlies team is just 2 players away  The bad news: those 2 players are LeBron James and Anthony Davis
"Like Anthony Davis, the Knicks go as Randle goes. It's that simple."
Anthony Davis got 21 free throws and had like 4 shots in the paint. He got free throws after kicking a dude in the nuts.  Trae's 9 don't seem *that* bad in comparison
Anthony “Draymond Green” Davis
Anthony “but I don’t wanna play the 5” Davis
"Following practice after Game 1 players told the bus driver it was the last bus to leave, however sources said the bus driver replied, “I’m not leaving until I get this s*** right.” And he continued doing laps around the facility and waiting for Anthony Davis, the Team had to leave a bus behind for the driver who stayed an extra hour. The bus driver finished Game 2 by leaving with Anthony Davis on time, and enjoying a plate of his wife's lasagna"
"NOLA Hornets Pelicans  PG: 07-08 Chris Paul  SG: 18-19 Jrue Holiday  SF: 02-03 Jamal Mashburn  PF: Present Day Zion Williamson  C: 17-18 Anthony Davis  Notable Omissions: Davis West, Baron Davis, Peja, Tyson Chandler, Brandon Ingram, Demarcus Cousins"
Deandre Atyon and the Chamber of Anthony Davis' Defense
"Get out of here with that nonsense. Anthony Davis (a big) shot 21 FTs, but Booker (a guard) shot 17 FTs. Overall, the Lakers shot only one more FT than the Suns in this game. What a garbage take."
You realize Reddit has notifications right? You must?  I checked your post history to find out why a grown man would have such an odd obsession with Anthony Davis and high schoolers but clearly didn’t get much.   Also not really a sick argument that I’m here just to argue when you replied to a days old post of mine....literally just to argue
"Sure. Giannis, Harden, KD, LeBron, Curry, Jokic, Anthony Davis, Embiid, Kawhi  But yeah EASILY TOP 5 AND THERES NO DEBATE XD"
"So far so good, but when you're a 7 seed against a 2 in the first round you can't really play the long game when it comes to your best lineups. You're in a position where you need to play your best lineups right away.  And I understand being worried about LeBron's health, he's 36 and coming off a high ankle sprain. But Anthony Davis is supposed to be a top 5 player in his prime. I had Lakers fans telling me last year that he's better than Duncan. He should be able to play the 5 and dominate with no problem and no worries about his health."
I thought that was the Anthony Davis video

It must suck going from DPOY level Anthony Davis and Lebron James to whatever the Clippers are doing
"His only argument was 35 years old! His teammate Anthony Davis WAS BETTER IN EVERY CATEGORY BESIDE ASSISTS, how was LeBron higher than him in the voting?   ONCE AGAIN ANTHONY DAVIS LED THE LAKERS IN EVERY STAT BESIDES ASSISTS.  That's because the media sucks his dick but you think everyone that says this is a hater."
Wouldn't an uninjured Anthony Davis make that list too?
Sometimes Anthony Davis also forgets he's Anthony Davis.
"You can when AD is helping, as evident tonight. They doubled and had Anthony Davis shading to help."
"3.5 at least - There's  Andre Drummond, Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell"
You have to acknowledge that there's a bit of a difference between playing with Anthony Davis compared to Paul George as well though.
Gotta love the incredibly illegal screen by Anthony Davis.
"Anthony Davis said he would be back better for Game 2, and man did he back his words. Respect."
People forgot Anthony Davis is still Anthony Davis
You think Booker and gimpy CP3 are going to win 3 of the next 4 against LeBron James and Anthony Davis?..on the road?
"trae young: 32 points, 9 FTA ""fuck this foul baiting mother fucker, literally unwatchable, refs ruining the game, this isnt basketball""  anthony davis: 33 points, 21 FTA ""this is big boy basketball, AD is locked in, dominant performance""  fucking hate this sub man"
"Anthony Davis gets out of his funk and has his best game in a while, LeBron plays a bit better, Chris Paul looks like his shoulder's bothering him.  Lakers come and even the series. I think this one goes the distance."
It felt like Anthony Davis got foul calls every time  he touched the ball.
Anthony Davis talking about dealing with adversity:  Grew up as a lower upper class teen his entire life  AD played on the most talented College Basketball team of all time  Demanded a trade from New Orleans because winning on his own was too hard
"“I’m a strong independent AD who don’t need no Bron”  -Anthony Davis, post-game interview"
Anthony Davis got his ass into high gear tonight
Welcome back Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis and Lebron James are Los Angeles Lakers.
"It must be screaming out to Frank Vogel, the Lakers coaching staff, and Anthony Davis himself that Davis is at his best when he isn't sharing the floor with a traditional center. That lineup they closed with of Schroeder, Caruso, KCP, LeBron and Davis has to be their starting and closing lineup. Interested to see what they do in game 3."
"Anthony ""Karate Kid"" Davis is 1-0 when aggressively kicking nuts"
Anthony Davis shot 21 FTs  Ayton shot 0 FTs  I'm just gonna leave this here
What about anthony davis always falling down when up 100 lbs on the defender
LeBron wasn't the difference tonight. Anthony Davis was.  LeBron had one or two big shots but from start to finish AD put this game on his shoulders.
Oh look it’s Anthony Davis taking free throws
Anthony Davis is huge.
Does Anthony Davis only have 4 made shots? Lmao
If I've learned anything from this game it's that Anthony Davis is soft as marshmallows
I'd appreciate it if they stopped showing closeups of Anthony Davis' face   That should never happen under any circumstances
Can't believe the Lakers have went on a game winning run with Anthony Davis playing at center! Crazy stuff!
It bothers me so much that Anthony Davis has to constantly be reminded by his coaches and teammates that he is Anthony Fucking Davis.
Anthony Davis is the ugliest man in the NBA. Stop showing closeups.
"I honestly don't know anyone who's an Anthony Davis fan. And no, Lakers fans don't count because they werent fans of him before he came there."
Talk more shit on Anthony Davis r/nba
Anthony Davis thinks he's a guard like he's one of the best big guys and he plays like he's scared
Laker fans are so soft. They put up with Davis being a diva and refusing to play the 5. Still buying Anthony davis jerseys and repping him on social media
“When you need me to play the 5 coach I’ll play the 5”   I guess right now doesn’t count for Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis is marshmallow soft. One of the worst defenders for his size I've ever seen.
Anthony Davis did something!!!!!
Can you imagine Kobe or shaq being as passive and delicate as anthony davis??? The laker fans back then would run them out of town. How do they tolerate davis on max contract when he is allergic to playing physical and scared to post up in the paint
how is anthony davis doing the exact opposite of how he started the game?  shits wild to me
A soft chump like anthony davis should never be allowed to wear Kobes shoes. Kobe would never bitch out and get steamrolled by a guy in his 1st playoff game ever.
Anthony Davis
"Anthony ""Free Throw"" Davis ugly as shit"
Anthony davis and lebron spend so much time on the floor on their hands and knees. Both used to being bottoms for each other lmao
These refs are fucking babying Anthony Davis jesus christ
Anthony Davis is a protected species
Anthony davis = Hall of Very Good.  Not hall of fame whatsoever!!
they are able to guard Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond with Cam Johnson and Dario Saric.  Pathetic by the lakers.

What's the confusion AD has been outplaying Anthony Davis tonight. Anthony on the other hand has been settling for fadeaway mid range shots like in Game 1
"We need to let AD cook, Anthony Davis is throwing him off his game and blocking the lane for him"
"Anthony ""Draymond Green"" Davis"
[Sources] the Lakers are starting Anthony Davis at Center tonight. Andre Drummond is being started at the Power Forward.
Why does Anthony Davis think he's kd he never plays in the paint
How is Anthony Davis 6'11 and 250lb but goes flying every time anyone bumps into him
Anthony Davis Larusso with the crane kick for 3!
It's tough to tell who thr tv crew are pushing for here.   Have they even mentioned if ANTHONY DAVIS stayed late or anything?
"Having Anthony Davis on your team must be so frustrating; dude would be a top 5 center in the league but refuses to play the position, forcing you to give Andre Drummond minutes"
Anthony Davis - Perfect Center is a little stretch
Anthony Davis  Andre Drummond just looks like a cartoon beaver. He's not that ugly.
I guess Jae crowder’s balls just fouled Anthony Davis foot
# ANTHONY DAVIS WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE
Anthony Davis needs help. Refs$$$
ANDRE DRUMMOND IS YOUNGER THAN ANTHONY DAVIS
Fuck Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis is the last person to complain about this.  Jae Crowder can't have kids now and Anthony Davis is the one upset.
"&gt;I don't understand why this is a narrative. He played most of last playoffs at the 5.  In a contract year.  Thousands of players have had great seasons, and been more amenable to team demands, when they need a new contract.  That does not necessarily apply to this, and the next four, seasons.  &gt;He doesn't wanna do it full time because of the physical stress but he has absolutely no problem doing it.   “I like playing the four, I’m not even going to sugarcoat it. I like playing the four, I don’t really like playing the five,” Davis said...   \--[https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/7/13/20693254/lakers-anthony-davis-doesnt-want-play-center-rob-pelinka-introduction-stats-lebron-james-star-power](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2019/7/13/20693254/lakers-anthony-davis-doesnt-want-play-center-rob-pelinka-introduction-stats-lebron-james-star-power)  Now, he has no reason to do anything he does not want to do, like I said.  Also, the Lakers promised Davis he would not have be a center.  Pelinka continued. “We wanted to make sure to honor what Anthony asked for when we traded for him: To get some fives that he could play with.”  (ibid)"
"Jokic has only been exposed once in the pnr when our 2 best screen navigators were out and even then Malone forced him to play drop coverage. Outside of that Jokic has not struggled to that extent, I'd say he's average. Idk why pnr D has to be judged individually when it involves 2 guys anyways so I was also harsh on Embiid there. However I still believe that Anthony Davis is the clear number 1 in pnr defence."

Antonym Davis sr and Anthony Davis
"sure but I mean who cares? He got hot when it mattered and won them a ring. Regardless u r going to live with whatever shots he makes because he's Anthony Davis. If he doesn't make them then too bad. You guys need to remember it's a game, it ain't that serious."
"I love the Lakers and I usually defend them from these losers but this was a very disappointing game. how did the kings drop 32 points on the best defense in the fourth quarter? Drummond is legitimately terrible. The Kings should've been an easy win to build confidence. instead, you have everyone bricking three's, allowing layups, and just throwing the ball away. Gasol was fantastic and Vogel just decided he wasn't worth going back to in the second half. More egregiously, Anthony Davis refuses to back down smaller guys in the post. He had Buddy Hield on him and just decided ""nah i'm good. I COULD get fouled but nah"". C'mon guys. There's no fight. No tenacity. How tf did a TERRIBLE Kings team fight harder than the DEFENDING champs. We have to do better. Also, I""m so tired of lakers fans looking down on everyone else. Idc if we won last year. stop bringing up the clippers, blazers, suns, and jazz. we have to work on ourselves before we can mock anyone. the season is passing us by."
they would lose to anthony davis by himself 1v5
Might be time to throw down on an Anthony Davis prop bet now
Which Anthony Davis does
"The reasoning was dumb, but Kobe was impossible to predict, not even Jerry West in his wildest dreams thought that Kobe would end up being what he became.  A prospect like Kobe or Giannis is just impossible, you can see the potential there, but is certainly not the safest pick. Anyone can spot a Shaq or a Anthony Davis, but Kobe? Fuck no."
Are you forgetting Anthony Davis is on his team lol?

"Buddy we are NOT taking WIggins back, and WE are not giving up KAT. especially now we are on a 4 game win streak and we are building something going into next year. KAT's loyal you know hes not an Anthony Davis"
Do an Anthony Davis one next lol turnover
"As someone who follows this shit closely / played football and tries his best to not just parrot what the hype is, I think his stock is along the lines of Anthony Davis or Zion Williamson- the clear-cut unanimous first overall pick with enormous potential.  A lot of people are grouping him in with, say, a LeBron James (or Peyton Manning) kind of ""guaranteed handful of 1st team all-pros"" kind of deal and I don't buy that hype. To me, that was Joe Burrow last season, and he was a top-15 MVP candidate as a rookie until he got his leg ripped off.  Personally I see Lawrence having a Drew Brees-like career: Almost always top-10 (post-rookie season), usually hovering around top-5, but never the best QB in the league. Going to the playoffs a lot, but only winning one ring. Still a HoF career, but people acting like he's the next GOAT QB are going to be disappointed imo."
All AD team  Adrian Dantley  Anthony Davis  Antonio Davis  Andre Drummond  and idk the 5th
"Not going to go blow by blow, but   &gt;Drummond was voted on to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in 2013 by the NBA coaches.  First team was Anthony Davis. Other rookie centers in 2013: Meyers Leonard, Alex Len, Tyler Zeller, Fab Melo, Miles Plumlee, and Festus Ezeli.  I don't know if being better than Fab Melo necessarily indicates you're a good player. Also, that was nearly a decade ago."
Anthony Day - to - Davis
"It depends. Are the Lakers getting ADisney or Anthony Davis? Because AD went on a fluke hot shooting streak, shooting 38% from 3 and 57% from the field throughout the playoffs last year. Both these shooting percentages are way higher than any point in his career outside of the Magic Kingdom. Without that fluke mickey mouse stretch the Lakers are a second round exit at best."
"I dont think you understand the question lmao  You're suggesting that if Lebron leaves the Lakers and Anthony Davis wins a ring without him, Lebron would still be the best player on the Lakers? When he's.. not even on the Lakers? Lmao"
Anthony Davis and Demarcus cousins was pretty good
"Unless they are both as versatile as Anthony Davis and Giannis, it won’t work as well."
Anthony Davis and Zion would have been interesting.
"What kind of lame parameter is that? If you take  Jordan off a list, is it the most talented? Take Kobe out of a list, is it the most talented? Jokic is the best passing center of all time having one of the best offensive seasons ever for any big man. KD is one if not the best scorers of all time. Kawhi is an alltime great still in his prime. Steph is finishing his career second best PG ever at worst and he's in his prime. Giannis at 25 is about as accomplished as any player in terms of individual accolades. CP3 is a HoF PG still fighting for all-nba positions. Harden is one of the greatest offensive players of all time breaking a lot of records. Luka is the most dominant young player since LeBron. Zion is putting up historic numbers in the paint. Embiid wouldn't look out of place inside the golden age of centers and he's having an incredible big man year. Anthony Davis just came off an incredible playoff run seen by few bigs in the last 30 years. Dame has had seasons better than most PGs ever in terms off offensive production. The list goes on and on. The talent in the league is ridiculous and it has little to do with LeBron James individually being on it. What a ridiculous thing to say. Take out Jordan from any year in the 90s. Take out Shaq in 01. Like I'm still confused at that statement lol"
anthony davis is definitely a superstar. he’s a perennial mvp and dpoy calibre player. reputation-wise those years in new orleans didn’t help but that just shows why reputation is meaningless
Haven't they also had Drummond during a portion of the season where they are missing Lebron James and Anthony Davis.
A 5/6 seed with a garbage offense and an out of shape Anthony Davis is not winning the championship
Which one would had a better name if they switch up their first name?  Do you prefer Anthony Drummond or Andre Davis?
Senpais put on notice:  Anthony Davis
"I agree but this time he had an actually competent team and had another Star in Anthony Davis. If Lebron was in the West, his legendary runs, like 2018 would not have happened/been possible, you simply just can't carry a team that hard to the Finals in the West."
"Anthony Davis is a unicorn and very clearly a superstar, i am so sick of seeing these piss poor AD takes. I watched my team get absolutely sodomized by AD and Jrue Holiday in the playoffs a few years ago, and it’s because AD is a force of nature and can asset his will almost anywhere on the court. Him playing with LeBron has made people forget how good AD is.   Also the omission of dame on your superstar list is extremely interesting. if you started watching basketball this year, then maybe this omission and your terrible take on anthony davis makes sense."
"?? Is this not the same exact thing people in this sub said about Anthony Davis for years? I know ya'll are gonna come back and say no, that's not what happened, but even recently I still see people say this about him. That he couldn't get it done in NOLA and he just had a bunch of empty numbers. Westbrook should not be immune to people questioning his intentions and whether he's capable and pushing himself and his team to the next level in the sport. He's certainly getting paid like he should be. I don't see why some of you are offended at someone daring to question why someone getting 200 million dollars has 17 wins on the season isn't catching some heat about not putting the team on his back. The triple doubles are fine, they're great, but how much does that really matter with 17 wins? The Wizards stink and it isn't because of covid. Westbrook and Bradley Beal have some explaining to do and someone calling them out about it isn't crazy at all."
if anthony davis posterizes ant the cycle is complete
"If Lebron doesn’t get fmvp i want Anthony Davis to win. After them , Jokic."
"Lol what...the lakers didn’t make the playoffs the year before, they got fucking Anthony Davis, what misfits are even talking about"
"If he’s not a deterrent at the rim he can get exposed in the playoffs. Even tho Jokic is a great playoff player, he gets exposed on defense by small guards driving into him and bigger guys taking him to school (Donovan Mitchell, Anthony Davis)  Not that it matters tho since he’s the best offensive player in the league lol."
A bunch of misfits... and Anthony Davis lmao.

They 27-34  and the Lakers are 35-24   Y’all are some dumb fucks.   They lost a game but Anthony Davis still won.
Anthony Davis is a nice person and could have totally ruined his day with a half trying foul. This is weak and hachimura a bitch. If you downvoted you probably fat and have never dunked or blocked a dunk and you probably a bitch too.
"For PFs,   Pg.  Anthony Davis, actually played pg before growth spurt.  If not, then Boris Diaw - only pf other than ""PF lebron"" to actually have run point, not just bring the ball up, i think  Sg.  Dirk or Barkley - barkley was a combo guard trapped in a center's butt  Sf.  Giannis.  He was a SF until his shoulders caught up  Pf.  Rasheed - might be the most powerfowardiest power forward that ever existed or ever will exist  C.  Duncan - playing him at pf instead of wearing him out at C against shaq and guys brought in to rough up shaq was probably the goat load management strategy"
I'll take one Anthony Davis please
"I mean, yeah lol. It's what makes Anthony Davis so elite defensively in the playoffs, for example. He's able to play high in the PnR and take away the 3 without giving up the lane  You can't always just play drop coverage. Otherwise you get Mitchell averaging like 40 on you, like happened last playoffs."
Jokic is about to win an MVP award and Anthony Davis has never topped even 50 wins as a first option.  You Lakers fans are something else.
He's being realistic. You think a 5/6 seed with a trash offense and an out of shape Anthony Davis is gonna win a championship?
Better than Anthony Davis

It is time to be legitimately worried about Anthony Davis
Next game injury report - Anthony Davis - OUT (Embarrassed)
Anthony “little guy” Davis.
This is r/nba you know I can imagine it  &gt;Anthony Davis locker room
"&gt; Because lebron took teams to the finals that Jordan wouldn’t make the Playoffs with. &gt;  &gt;   Like who? I can only imagine the damage MJ would've did with Irving, Love, Bosh, Wade, Davis, etc. etc.  Imagine if Shaq went to the Bulls in 96 instead of the Lakers. That's similar to what Davis is.  &gt;Also 0-5 finals mvp sidekick Curry begged the second best player in the league to carry him also against an old lebron  And Lebron James begged Wade and Bosh to join him to carry him against  the rest of the NBA.  Then he begged Irving and Love. Then he begged Anthony Davis.  &gt;Since 3 all nba players in their prime weren’t enough to stop him  Lebron got destroyed by the Spurs and had to run back to Cleveland lol. Then he got destroyed by the Warriors twice."
"Lol also the west was 3-6 against Lebron in the Finals. Most of those were dominating wins (sweeps, 4-1s, etc. etc.). Lebron was gonna get exposed again so he went and got Anthony Davis. That's not what GOATs do lol."
&gt; 3rd in the west before he got injured &gt;  &gt;   Then why get Anthony Davis?  &gt;The west never had a player like lebron.  The west is like 3-6 in the Finals against him lol and most of those were dominating wins.
&gt; Old lebron demolished the “tough” west and back door everyone &gt;  &gt;   With Anthony Davis and in the bubble. His first year on the Lakers was bad and he knew it.
Anthony Davis he’s a top 5 player in the league but no one likes to put him up there because he’s on the Lakers. He just had a better playoff run than Steph and Harden
"Yeah yet u had one fall in your lap, your team failed him and then as soon as he leaves you get another one. Your complaining about small market teams but getting Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson is a lot more of a cheat."
I think the justification is that he didn't really need to score for boston to win because of his ridiculous defense. A good modern example would be Anthony Davis in college.
The one with Anthony Davis in it?
LAC if you base it off these people but Anthony Davis is a front court player too and I’d take him over any
"I was talking about ceiling vs floor. If Wisemans ceiling as a rim runner was Gobert, Lamelos comparable ceiling based on the talents he showed would have to be much higher than Rubio, possibly a Luka level player. You could see him having the talent to score and create, and if those talents hit you have a player who can carry your team to competence single handedly. Wiseman on the other hand gets you at absolute best an Anthony Davis, who while a superstar needs a Luka level player next to him to really maximize him to the best level.   Lamelos floor would’ve been something like Rubio. Wisemans is Mitchell Robinson without the defense. So maybe you draft him based on that, but that would make them idiots for drafting based on players worst case scenarios."
Your reddit avatar is really cute but the Celtics are a much better team the the Anthony Davis pelicans
"Your argument originally had to do with the Lakers draft record, not how they managed those assets. You're changing your argument and I honestly have no idea why you're being so abrasive about it...we are just talking hoops after all. I would argue that a top 5-10 player like AD is almost invaluable, and he proved that in the playoffs last year. If that was the minimum that the Pelicans would take then that's what they had to pay. The Pelicans certainly didn't need to trade AD and they made it abundantly clear that they needed an offer they couldn't refuse to let him go. Kevin Love as good as he was is certainly not Anthony Davis, and Wiggins was considered by some to be the next superstar...they traded him before he played a day in the NBA. And the AD trade worked out pretty well for both sides, so ultimately what is more draft picks and pick swaps worth for a championship? I would say not much.  You're not even making the right arguments if you're trying to poke holes in Lakers front office moves, there's plenty you can bring up like not resigning Brook Lopez for peanuts, the aforementioned Zubac trade, the Luol Deng signing (who they are STILL paying, LOL), basically every free agent move in LeBron's first year (Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley, etc.)."
Cavs drafted a star  Drafted a mountain of busts alongside that star  Used some of their busts to get a useful player because an all-time great came back to the team  That all time great leaves and guess what...they go right back to drafting busts  Lakers drafted useful players both early and late in the draft. 3 of those useful players became anthony davis. A 4th player they drafted made an allstar team. A 5th is going to be allnba  The lakers have a better track record with worse picks
"From a #4 pick you generally want someone you can build around  Not a 2 bit role player who was only relevant because again, bron was born in the remote area.  What y'all did with dion in a trade is meaningless. You drafted a bust. And again, bron  Bennet is an objectively bad pick, wiggs is average. And then, yet again, bron  You guys are 1 birth away from a young core of kyrie, dion, TT, bennet, and wiggs. That is terrible by any measure  The lakers sent all those assets because anthony davis is that good and the pelicans knew it  Kuz and THT are better than any player that cavs drafted from 04-10 and they're both late picks.  The lakers did more with 3 #2, and a #7 than the cavs did with 3 #1, 2 #2 , 2 #5 and a #8  Cavs are just a god awful organization"
"Im not using anyone I even remotely commonly see as top 5, so no Kobe, Shaq, or Hakeem either   PG - Steph Curry  SG - Dwyane Wade  SF - Klay Thompson  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Anthony Davis   Ridiculous defense, ridiculous spacing, with one of the best cutters ever to abuse it."
"LeBron is literally a championship offense all by his damn self, WITHOUT Anthony Davis. With him? Yeah, the Lakers are gonna be fine lmao"
The Lakers drafting allowed them to acquire LeBron and Anthony Davis so I'm not sure how the Cavs or Sixers tanked more efficiently...
Well both teams are suffering from health issues but all things being even I trust Anthony Davis more than I trust Paul George in terms of second options so I'll go Lakers
"u/Sparks0480 is right that the best way is to watch games. You don't need to rush this and try to become an expert analysis by the end of this season's playoffs. Maybe some people portray themselves as knowing more than they do (and I'm guilty of that myself), but I think there's more enjoyment in just watching games for entertainment.   Responding to some of your post's specific prompts:  &gt;I'm also sadly from Seattle where we were robbed of our basketball team so not sure who to root for either.   You don't need to root for any particular team, and you might consider following specific players for the next couple of seasons and that may lead you to follow their teams by proxy However, there's a lot of chatter about a Seattle-based expansion team which might be created in the next 5 years, so you may wish to save your team loyalty for if/when that happens.  &gt;I don't fully understand it from a player perspective and technique/gameplan perspective.  Watch the playoffs in particular for game plans and adjustments. Try to follow a couple series and watch all the games in their entirety. This regular season is kind of wonky with the various absences (injuries, COVID protocols, etc) and the compressed schedule so this has not been a great season for adjustments. Many teams are just trying to be healthy by the start of the playoffs. They don't have time to implement new defensive schemes for each opponent every other night in the regular season.  &gt;Who's important to which teams  On good teams, that's usually their best couple players. On up and coming teams, that might be rookies/sophomores who the team hopes can develop and turn into an All-Star caliber player in a couple years. For example, a good team like the Lakers has LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the Lakers want those two guys healthy for the playoffs. A team that is trying to rebuild like the Thunder has Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lu Dort and they want those two to show development and gain experience through the course of the season.   &gt;what teams/players have rivalries  Many. Too many to list. Some are more historical (e.g. Lakers v Celtics from the 80s) and some are modern social media beefs (which I personally don't think are worth following).   &gt;what teams need what kind of players  Everyone wants talent. In the NBA, arguably more so than sports like NFL and MLB, talent wins out. It is very rare for a team to win the title with a player who is not a top 5 MVP candidate or 1st Team All-NBA level of player. The 2004 Pistons are the rare exception which I think highlights how important elite talent is for winning a title. But only 1 team can win the title each year and I don't think that means 29 teams are full of losers. Teams can define success in different ways.   Teams with stars might want other high-level talent to try and win while they have a healthy and prime-age star. Teams with lots of young players might want to focus on player development and locker room culture and internal improvement. Every team has different needs and also different resources available because of the nature of NBA contracts and how much money teams can spend on player salaries.   &gt;how do basketball teams practice for playing against different teams, techniques and formations, etc.   In the regular season, very little. This season, even less. The playoffs are where you will see game to game adjustments like tweaking the starters or the player rotations. Good coaches can take in what did and didn't work from game 1 and try for a more advantageous set of match-ups in game 2.  &gt;What's a good way to learn things of this nature?   Watch games and have fun. You're watching to have fun so make sure it is fun for you and don't worry too much about how other people are doing."
&gt; Brandon Ingram &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick &gt; &gt; Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  BWAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH  FOR ANTHONY DAVIS  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  17TH RING  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH  Pure clown shoes partner.  All you can argue here is that Lakers made some trades at the time that didn't turn out.   You abandonded your argument about Lakers drafting poor because you know you got spanked with the examples I gave you.  Lmfao enjoy Kevin Love and your ace managment in Cleveland.  I smell a first round exit in the playoffs... in like another 15 years.  Kings of the east.  literally
"Because when you can get a player like Anthony Davis you do it? You don't lose out on Anthony Davis by playing fucking hard ball, I'll tell you that. Go ask Danny Ainge how that asset hoarding has worked for him."
"Lol well the list is short. First team all NBA with championships active players: LeBron KD Kawhi? Steph Anthony Davis? Kyrie?  Not sure if those ? Ever got first team all NBA.  So I would take Russ for sure after those names. Maybe even before Kyrie.   There's no argument that a 6'7"" - 6'10"" SF two way players are who you want to build your team around."
"Third Team: Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaq  Fourth Team: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  Fifth Team: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Jason Tatum, Zion Willamson, Bam Adebayo"
I think Zion would be a great fit on the Timberwolves for the exact same reason. I hate to see him waste away like Anthony Davis.
Draymond is an incredible defender. Put he isn’t stopping PRIME DEMARCUS COUSINS who just happens to be paired with ANTHONY DAVIS and is being fed by notorious playoff performer RAJON RONDO
Westbrook had one good year after Durant then fell off a cliff. I wouldn’t say Durant maximized him but he didn’t step on Russ’ toes at all and they worked very well together. There is virtually no other star except for an Anthony Davis type who could fit that well with Russ.
The reigning champion with LeBron James and Anthony Davis are not a dark horse team lol.
&gt; LeBron James and Anthony Davis
Lebron James and Anthony Davis lmao
I’ll ask the same question I asked last season. Who’s guarding LeBron James and Anthony Davis?
"Last couple of minutes AD was like “ Oh Shit, I’m Anthony Davis”"
Anthony Davis slowly but surely getting his legs and rhythm back. Good to see.   Lebron back in a week!
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind. RJ Barrett comes in 3rd.* ***Thibs intensifies***  Booker (1884), Beal (1811), Mitchell (1771), LaVine (1867), Tatum (1959), Butler (1490)  *I hope Mitchell does not miss the rest of the season, but as of today, he's played nearly as many minutes as the other players vying for a spot on the all-NBA teams. Currently listed as week-to-week.*  Best unmentioned players by RAPTOR: Clint Capela, Mike Conley, FVV, Jrue Holiday, Jamal Murray, Draymond Green, Jakob Poeltl, Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, and Thaddeus Young. Anthony Davis (800) and Kevin Durant (812) played too few minutes, but have been effective in their limited time."
"tbf, Ben Taylor has 3 players he absolutely LOVES: Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, and Stephen Curry. Anything pertaining to them is always depicted positively"
"Lakers are better without Anthony Davis. If it costs playing in the play-in game to get AD up to speed, so be it."
Last year Anthony Davis was on the Ruffles bag so I'm glad the bag won't be so ugly this year
"&gt;killer midrange  Of the 20 highest volume shooters from long midrange (15+ feet) over the past 3+ seasons, AD has the worst FG%:  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|338|657|.514| |2|Khris Middleton|411|853|.482| |3|J.J.

"&gt; no one in the game is a bigger game changer on both offense and defense, like Anthony Davis  You might be forgetting a certain back to back MVP. A kid from Greece. Long last name."
"Wiseman is 4 games removed at the beginning of the season from playing HS basketball and here I thought he would best the likes of Anthony Davis, Clint Capela, and Joel Embiid.  Silly me."
"&gt;  plus a top 10 player, who wouldn't be confident   AD has always been Top 5..  What's up with this typical * recency bias* horseshit    Not even that. Healthy AD is Top 3 if you count BOTH ends simultaneously, because no one in the game is a bigger game changer on both offense and defense, like Anthony Davis. Playing alongside someone like LeBron only enhances it to the max    You'll see that again in the upcoming playoffs."
"I love watching Steph, Kyrie, Brad Beal and Anthony Davis. And then the guys I came in with like Bam, Donovan and Fox. - Jayson Tatum"
Hi Jayson! Would you please consider joining the Lakers once your contract is up with the Celtics? You and Anthony Davis would be a dynamic duo.
"Perhaps, but 2012's got solid answers in Anthony Davis and Dame.  Obviously Jokic and Embiid are having the better year, but Dame and Davis have already built a HoF body of work themselves.  I think it'll be close either way."

"Anthony ""Day to Day"" Davis"
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"A list of American bigs who can do those things off of the top of my head (active only): Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns, Zion"
&gt; Which explains your lack of offensive weapons.  No the lack of offensive weapons is Lebron James and Anthony Davis and now Dennis Schroeder out of the games.  That being most of our offense.  You might not be aware but Lebron and AD were kind of the offense in the playoffs last year that won a title.  Our 17th.  How many do you have again?  Also re slow pace = #1 defense   Lakers rank 15th in team possesions per game you know who has the lowest?  Let's look!  Dallas 27th  Miami 28th  OH LA CLIPPERS 29th ranked at 99.8 possessions per game.   NINTH RANKED DEFENSE.  So you are saying Clippers have no defense they just play slow then?
Anthony “see y’all when my big bro Bron back” Davis
"Anthony ""Day to day"" Davis"
If you're telling me anthony freaking davis can't get customized lebrons then nike doesn't know what its doing
let the blame game on lebrons teammates begin.. ladies and gentleman.. enter andre drummond!.. next week we will be covering anthony davis!!
We also experienced Anthony Davis the champion which makes it sting a little less
Anthony Davis is also ahead of Steve Nash on it so I’m using grains of salt on that.
"Fair points and I agree with you. This is just me being irrational and having a hard time betting against lebron james and Anthony davis + solid role players. Frank Vogel isn't a joke of a coach either, he's actually really good."
Gonna go a little out of the box for Zion. I think Anthony Davis could be the best pairing. I think fitting Zion in a good defensive team is tough because you either need to completely clog the lane like the pelicans are doing now or hve him as your main big which will be horrific defensively.   Davis solves these issues with providing decent spacing and elite defense. Rest of the team is just spacing around Zion
Steph Curry  Anthony Davis  Boban Marjonovic
"He elaborated in literally the sentence after that lol. Drummond has such terrible footwork that he doesn’t move well on offense or defense, despite being so agile for his size. Anthony Davis’ footwork is impeccable; it’s awesome watching him play defense."
"AD isn't a leader. Lebron James is. When lebron is back, players will have more defined roles and won't fuck around as much. I don't give a fuck about the seeding. any team with Lebron James and Anthony Davis + elite role players is a contender"
"I formally declare ""Anthony Day-to-Davis"" as my favorite current nickname in the NBA.  Thank you for that, funny shit!"
Anthony Day to Davis
Question is.. can they expect him to play like THE Anthony Davis?
"Steph also had a medical procedure that is fairly risky to address his ankle issues, had scar tissue removed, and changed the form of his jump shot and landing to protect his ankles.  I don’t think Anthony Davis is capable of doing all those things, and even less so at this stage of his career."
"Wood really isn’t a 5. He can play there on offense, but he has absolutely no strength to fight on defense with 5s on other teams. Rockets should try to use him like Anthony Davis and play him at the 4 next to a floor spacing big (maybe they should draft Mobley if they don’t get the #1 pick)."
"If I don't know any better, I would see this as Anthony Davis having his feelings hurt."
Anthony day-to-Davis
He earned the nickname Anthony day-to-Davis for a reason.
"😂 😂 tell me when he wins a ring without another Superstar/Superteam. He has hella talent himself but he couldn’t lead a team to a ring without other top stars. Guess who else has hella talent? The other top 10 players in the league that given the chance to play with D Wade, Bosh, Kyrie, Love, and Anthony Davis would have the same success. Don’t give me that bs about how he made the Finals so many times, the East had 0 superstars when he played there while the west had all of them."
"Watch his high school tape , believe it or not he was actually a point forward on his team:   [Andre Drummond Official Mixtape Vol. 4 UCONN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXB6vc5Z_A4)  Drummond was the #1 rated prospect in his HS class for a while (until Anthony Davis had his growth spurt basically). I honestly think he grew too big and lost control of his body that he had when he was younger, he also doesn't look like he keeps himself in the best shape either."

Anthony Day to Davis and CP3 to 6 weeks are my two favorite NBA nick names.
"He looks between 6'5"" and 6'9"". I can't find a definitive pic, but here are a few comparisons: [https://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Draymond+Green+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+gMHlwqA\_fYUx.jpg](https://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Draymond+Green+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+gMHlwqA_fYUx.jpg)  [https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2012/05/paul-pierce11.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;crop=1](https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2012/05/paul-pierce11.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480&amp;crop=1)  [https://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Anthony+Davis+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+Iy7IZsJW-3mx.jpg](https://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Anthony+Davis+Ed+Malloy+New+Orleans+Pelicans+Iy7IZsJW-3mx.jpg)"
"He’s still getting more contested boards a game than a player like Deandre Jordan, Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Biyombo, Brook or Robin Lopez, and more even though his contested rebound % is around 25%. He gets more contested rebounds per game and at a higher percentage than Lebron and he is also within 0.2 contested rebounds or less of Anthony Davis, Julius Randle, etc. Really no matter how you slice it he’s a pretty incredible rebounder. Guards can’t do what he does and its not something that should be simply chalked up to “they want to speed up the pace.” That’s true, but you need a special player to be able to get the rebound with that degree of regularity in the first place."
Anthony day to davis
"Yup, realistically a 2.5 month offseason was always gonna be a ton to overcome for a 36 year old LeBron and glass man Anthony Davis."
"But why wouldn't they just say ""Anthony Davis Will Not Return (Ankle)"" since everyone already assumed that was the reason he wasn't going to return...saying back spasms makes me think it actually is back spasms and that there's something wrong with both his back and his ankle, haha.  You don't need to switch the injury from ankle to back in order to keep him out for the game..."
hey what happened to the Anthony Davis GTA RP thread?
"God, that's so apt at describing Drummond.   You have Anthony Davis (AD). Drummond should have the inverse property of AD as his nickname:  1/AD"
I don’t care what anybody says. Anthony day to Davis  is the goat nickname.
Anthony Davis (When we lose we need an excuse) will not return
RIP Anthony Davis: Taken out by a Taco Bell sign
"I’m not a Grizzlies fan, so I just assumed they were hanging around .500 with Ja playing well, not scraping ugly wins against bad teams. I’m glad to know otherwise.  Also, this is a free and open forum where you can post anything remotely basketball related, I’m not sure why there’s this gatekeeping culture about things being too niche for our precision machine. This place asked Anthony Davis if he scissored Lebron, we have no standards."
"It’s been very weird watching Lakers fans experience the Anthony Davis Pelicans fans knew. Like the Achilles stuff was abnormal for him but these twisted ankles here, get evaluated in the locker room there, that’s the Anthony Davis experience. I don’t know what was expected, that he’d move to LA and be drastically healthier the rest of his career. No hate intended. I hope he can be healthier going forward for the rest of his career, but I’d just prepare as if this will be common going forward Lakers fans for your own mental health."
LMAO Marv Albert managed to throw in a mention to Taco Bell when describing Anthony Davis twisting his ankle.
I think we all know about Anthony day to Davis
"Interesting, you don’t generally get to use the “no body believes in us” as the defending champions, but lets be real guys, i know you all are feeling good thinking yeah the lakers are trash, they are broken down, lebron is too old and injured he won’t recover!, but we have been through this, its LeBron James, and he has Anthony Davis, and and actually good coach."
Anthony “We’re back” Davis with 4 pts 2-9 shooting so far 💀
"When Russ was healthy, the Rockets were the best team in the league. Their small ball completely destroyed the Lakers. If Russ was healthy, Rockets could've won the series. Despite playing with a torn quad, Russ and the Rockets managed to keep the series close with every game being within 10 points other than game 5. Imagine trying to blow by Anthony Davis and Lebron James with a torn quad? Please use some context."
Anthony aahhhhh Davis
Anthony Davis loves falling over
Wait anthony davis is playing gangster gta rp? Lmao amazing
ANTHONY DAVIS
Anthony Davis got spanked by Dwight Howard when he was on the lakers
I can't belive we get to witness the Anthony Davis villain arc realtime as it began starting with his failed AMA.
What's KD's height? 7ft? Bron's like 6'9. It also helps that KD's wingspan is pretty much untouchable outside of Giannis and Anthony Davis. Really drives home the height difference. This pic really shows it.  https://cavaliersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gettyimages-693608816.jpg
"yep  advertising is just as much just making you consider their product when it comes time for you to buy something like that  so when you crave potato chips, you go and see “oh wow orginal ruffles lmao Anthony Davis would love that shit”   and then i buy em for the lolz and it’s just potato chips anyway   i catch myself doing it all the time"
How about Anthony Davis quitting on the Pelicans so he could be traded to play with LeBron? Shady for a former #1 pick and he doesn’t get near enough heat for it. Couldn’t cut it as a franchise leader so crowd his way to LA so Daddy James could be the focus and Davis could just hoop as second-fiddle.
The answer is Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis.

Cole Anthony Davis
but that is paul george recruiting anthony davis though. that the trade would be unlikely (but not “physically impossible”) is another question altogether
[it wasn’t tho](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2923333-anthony-davis-confirms-he-talked-to-paul-george-about-teaming-up-on-pacers)
Wasn't KD like 28 before he left?  Anthony Davis was 27 when he won the chip and LBJ was 25 or 26 when he won his chip and Steph Curry in 2014 was 26 or 27 when he won his chip.
A great playmaker with subpar shooting and bad defense can raise a floor really well but if you put him on a team with a couple of great playmakers already he doesn't help the team as much. he can come off the bench and contribute but not to the same extent.  It depends on the team that is looking for a ceiling raiser and what they lack. but every team could use an Anthony Davis/Joel Embiid.
"they didn’t add to each others games and they still won 2 championships and went to four finals, so uhh yeah that kinda proves my point  anthony davis + role players is much more talented than the combo they got rid of  and kd was better than harrison barnes so, yeah the team got better with him, obviously  also thats literally what i said, talent is king and fit brings teams over the top"
Maybe Anthony Davis could grow a pair
&gt;Anthony Davis Shoots Steph Curry **In GTA Roleplay** 💀
No it’s not. The heat are the perfect example. Wade and lebron both didn’t hve very scalable skill sets because they’re ball dominant and non elite shooters. Lebron and shooters on the cavs actually did better offensively during the regular season than lebron and wade sharing the floor. Lebron led bench lineups outperformed wade lebron lineups in Miami.   They didn’t add to each other’s games at all.   Compare that to Durant who joined the warriors and actually made them significantly better during the regular season when healthy they played at a 14 srs which was +4 over their +10 during their 73 win season.    Anthony Davis is another good example. Lakers with lebron lonzo Ingram hart etc were playing at a +1-+2. They lose virtually everyone but add Anthony Davis and all of a sudden play at a +6-+8 and are dominant. Davis synergizes extremely well with virtually any star because of his defensive presence and spacing and roll man abilities. That impact from Davis would rival any of the top 5 players and if anything it’s more impressive to take a team to that level than it is to take a twam from -3 to +3.   Now stacking as much talent is always important but it is important to look at which players are best at fitting with other stars. Westbrook is the most extreme example of being a terrible fit. Lebron is actually one of the lesser as well he’s just so good that it doesn’t matter. Durant Anthony Davis Steph are 3 of the best.
Imagine 5 years ago telling someone you can make hundreds of thousands on a fake internet Doge coin and people would be hyped about Anthony Davis roleplaying in GTAV
"shame on me, I'm gonna have to go to the library and re-read the whole Anthony Davis biography on the internet."
"Anthony Davis is a thug, all but confirmed"
Anthony Davis is up there for sure

I mean the guy beat up Anthony Davis he is obviously very strong
"Anthony Davis is slow though, Wilt would be super Giannis"
Just watched this video and i feel like if he was playing today he would look a lot like Anthony Davis. Long af and covers a lot of the court and operates a lot from the mid range.
"Right, it’s definitely a good coaching decision to have “DPOY level defender” Anthony Davis not guard embiid and have him drop 35 pts and win"
"Anthony Davis last year was every bit as good as Lebron James and if you say otherwise you didn't watch the games whatsoever.  I'm not sure how you can be our best scorer and defender against inside attacking teams, shut them down, and then people act like it was some massive gap between the two. AD was every bit as good as Lebron last year in the playoffs up until his injury."
It is not reasonable to think that a team lead by two guards who don't play defense is better then a team headlined by LeBron James and Anthony Davis coming off a finals win.
"we should be so grateful, hell we should have bowed down to Anthony Davis, for that AMA sponsored by a potato chip company."

Dude he’s not a top 10 player in the league have you been watching him...this is not the old Anthony Davis.

"Shaq: “Here‘a my top NBA players... #1, my man, LeBron James. Wish I helped him win in Cleveland, but he’s helping my Lakers win big. #2, my man, Anthony Davis.

Big fella like yours truly... #4... here’s what I’m gonna say, Joel Embiid has gotta step it up if he wants to win a championship... rings, Erneh... and the fact is when guys like KD and Giannis are in the East, you gotta fight harder and play in the paint... what team is Kevin Love on again? Anyways, that’s my list, I think my man, Anthony Davis could go back-to-back this year, unlike you, Chuck... who never even had one back, much less than two!... Dame’s pretty good, also... not as good as me, though.”"
even the piece of shit Jeff Lowe from Tiger King had a better AMA than Anthony Davis
No the fuck he isn’t. You just said Tobias Harris and Anthony Davis are close defensively this season. Delusional.
"PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit is launching the first TV campaign for its Ruffles brand of ridged potato chips in almost a decade, while extending its marketing partnerships with star basketball players. The ""Own Your Ridges"" campaign includes two commercials starring Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers all-star who began his partnership with Ruffles last year, per an announcement.  Davis appears in the two commercials offering a comic take on questions like, ""What would Ruffles be like without their ridges?"" to showcase what makes the potato chips distinct. The first commercial will air during the NBA All-Star Game on TNT on March 7, and the second will run during the Grammy Awards on CBS on March 14. Ruffles also announced a partnership with Boston Celtics all-star Jayson Tatum on the release of Ruffles Flamin' Hot BBQ, a flavor inspired by the spicy cuisine in his hometown of St. Louis.  To expand the campaign beyond TV, Ruffles launched a ""Ridge Awards"" campaign on social media that asks people to ""recognize the people in their lives who have a lot of flavor."" Ruffles on March 14 will release a custom augmented reality (AR) filter on Instagram the lets its followers hold up a virtual ""Ridge Award,"" per the announcement."
r/dooaniel talk me through your thought process as you watched Anthony Davis and the Lakers destroy your Serbian all star and the Nuggets.
"That’s Anthony Davis, NBA champion and collegiate champion. Winner in all levels"
"Yeah Anthony Davis, known career playoff carrier."
"his team also didnt have anthony davis on the roster, and i believe ingram and lonzo were out too. but yes lebron himself was not great towards the end of that season after coming back from the groin injury"
"I literally don’t care that he’s averaging more points. That doesn’t say anything. I watch basketball nearly every night. Anthony Davis plays alongside Lebron now, of course he doesn’t score as much. I watched him score at will when he was the bonafide number one option on the pels, as Zion has become over the last month or two. I also saw him take his team to the playoffs and carry them in the playoffs, scoring over 30 a game with elite defense. If Zion were a top 10 player in the league he’d be in the playoffs, like every other guy on that list.   AD still has a more complete offensive skill set and is a far superior defender. He can stretch the floor and lock down the paint.   Zions stats being better than AD’s this season does not make him a better player. And to say he’s leagues above AD is just foolish.   Zion is incredible and very well could be a top 5 or even the best player in the league in no time. He’s not there yet.  You didn’t even have time to have read my whole comment before downvoting lmfao"
"I've never seen people disregard defense due to TS%, but people definitely disregard defense on here when talking about player impact and comparing players.   I think the biggest example is Jokic vs. Embiid for this season. This isn't to downplay jokic's all time offensive season, but when comparing their campaigns pre-Embiid injury people never really seriously took into account how much better of a defender Embiid was compared to Jokic.  Similar things happen with Anthony Davis. He's having an off year, but throughout his career he's been amazing on both ends of the ball and last year in the playoffs was having an all time scoring stretch combined with DPOY level defense yet when being compared to LeBron people basically disregarded his contributions because of LeBron's playmaking(even though that isn't AD's role).  In the Giannis and Harden debate people were again baffled that Giannis was so clear cut MVP when Harden was having one of the best scoring runs of all time. Why? Because again fans didn't really account for the defensive separation than existed between the two.   I do disagree that people that value TS% disregard defense. I do agree with you the overall premise that people do disregard defensive impact overall though, especially when compared to offensive contributions.   This has always been a make or miss league. ""Makes"" are easier than ever now, which means being able to consistently cause misses is also valuable. What separated the old Warriors from everyone else wasn't just their threes, it was how consistently they could score while getting consecutive stops on the other end. It's a recipe to blowing out teams."
He's leagues better than Anthony Davis right now
"The Lakers are playing the team with the league's second best record, they're playing without home court advantage, and are down two starters, including Anthony Davis. Meanwhile the Clippers tanked to get the Mavs, they have home court advantage, and are more healthy than Dallas is (Luka vs Ibaka), and yet they're in a worse position than the Lakers are and you're talking shit? At least there are legit reasons for why the Lakers are losing, one of which is the short off-season after winning last year's title. What's your excuse?"
Should Anthony Davis play in game 6?
He said KD not Anthony Davis
lol @ the people saying that no player wanted to do an AMA after the Anthony Davis one     This is not even a month since?
"If I can package Kuzma, some pieces and maybe even a pick for Devin Booker to join Anthony Davis and LeBron James, would I do that? Hell yes"
Anthony Street clothes Davis lmfaoo
&gt;  he dropped in standings.   because Anthony Davis was out with injury. The Lakers had the second best record in the league on February 14th when AD got injured.
I mean dame doesn't do half the foul baiting of Anthony Davis. Only difference with Ad any small contact could have been serious as he is made of tissue paper.
if you stick Anthony Davis on an elite PG for a whole game its not gonna end well lmao
I remember it used to be hard to take Anthony Davis serious with the unibrow but he just owned it and everyone got used it to it. Maybe the same will happen with Trae lol.
He moved his family to LA so his son can attend a LA school. He went to LA for a family move. He's not uprooting for the warriors. Plus Anthony Davis is his best chance at winning a ship not playing with Draymond Klay and Curry.
it's hilarious because candace is actually AD's doppelgänger lmao  she's still pretty but if you've ever seen her without makeup she really does look like a young anthony davis (without the longer hair and beard)
"They played:  Michael Jordan: 179  Luka Doncic: 11  Allen Iverson: 71  Kevin Durant: 144  Jerry West: 153  LeBron James: 265  Anthony Davis: 38  Donovon Mitchell: 27  Rick Barry: 74  Elgin Baylor: 134    In other words, 11 games is nothing. One bad game will drop him out of top 10. It's a lot harder to maintain the high scoring than just have a hot start...LBJ's average is insane with more than 3 FULL seasons (in number of games) of playoff games"
"Next season: Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis join forces and form a new team in LA"

"You might think i'm stupid, but remember this comment, the celtics are playing CHESS not checkers, they know a duo of 24 yr olds aren't going to beat LeBron James Anthony davis duo/Kevin Durant James Harden Kyrie trio, either we're building Pritchard, NeSmith, Langford for the future when those groups retire or we are building them to be trade assets for the final 2/3 years of Tatum/Brown's contract to convince them to stay"

Randle is frustrating to watch. He reminds me a lot of Anthony Davis. Just settles for jumpers. Tries to play like a guard. Randle is a really strong. He can power his way in the post for easier looks. But damn this era of bigs wanting to play like guards.

"I don't wish ill for Anthony Davis, but I reeeealy don't feel bad for Laker fans. Nor LeBron, who has benefitted from other teams' injuries his entire career."
"Exactly.  Jimmy Butler? Left Minny for Miami after just a couple seasons.  Paul George? Left OKC after just a couple seasons.  Kawhi Leonard? Left Tornoto after just a season.  Anthony Davis? Made it clear he would refuse to re-sign with any team other than the Lakers, which he did.  The Kawhi trade only looks good because the Raptors won a ring against a depleted Warriors. Remove the hindsight bias and we could have lost Jaylen Brown for a ECF or Finals loss before losing Kawhi. No thanks. Respectfully to DeRozen, the Raptors didn't give up much - DeRozen's value is significantly lower than Brown's and their timetable was win-now.  IMO the player we should have made more of an effort for Harden."
"Anthony Davis was the first option on the Lakers.  Blazers series: AD outscored Lebron in 3 of 5 games, overall numbers went down in game 4 when Lakers won in a blowout and he shot 8 times(Lebron's also were brought down in game 2 where he scored 10 points on 11 shots).  Rockets series: AD outscored Lebron in 3 of 5 games, his average was brought down by only scoring 13 in a blowout game 5 where he shot 9 times.  Nuggets series: AD outscored Lebron in 3 of 5 games.  Heat series: Lebron outscored Ad in 4-6 games(last two AD was injured, game 3 he was in foul trouble throughout).  AD was our go to guy last year and is again this year and we're solely missing him right now."

As long as Anthony Davis can still hit his free throws the lakers will beat the suns game 6 and it will not be close.
"I was just saying this about Anthony Davis and how he recklessly just leaps towards the rim as if he's a 6'3 guard. It's admirable in a sense of ""putting your body on the line"" and attacking the hoop, but man these guys just go airborne and pray to stick the landing too much of the time.    But it's tricky too because a player like Joel is a ""unicorn"" because of the guard-type elements of his game like the driving, euro, and step back. That threat of him driving to the paint from the 3 point line is what makes him impossible to defend, but then it leads to shit like this"
"&gt; While the Los Angeles Lakers were getting crushed coming out of a timeout in Game 5 against Phoenix, Anthony Davis looked over to an individual sitting courtside and nodded his head up and down to suggest everything is going to be OK. He flashed six fingers, as in a Game 6 return."
"Please, for the love of all that is holy, explain to me who the “shooters” are because there is not a single trade or free agency acquisition on the 2019-2020 Lakers roster that can reasonably be described as the right “shooters”. Danny Green is the only feasible player to fit that criteria and he essentially single-handedly lost several post season games with his terrible shooting and his ability to coast on his prior reputation as a shooter.   I hope for your argument’s sake that you aren’t about to argue that Frank Vogel has had anything to do with the Lakers success. The FO didn’t hire the “right coach”. They hired an experienced re-tread who has to sit there and do very little while LeBron pilots the team as he has any other time in his career.   There was no “righting of the ship” when Magic left, unless you want to spell out something specific for me. The team remained the same after his departure and would likely still be in the same place if LeBron never came (although in that case it’s likely Paul George or Kawhi would’ve come, which just further re-enforces the notion that all LA has to do is sit there and wait for talent).   The Buss family conflict is/was a complete non-story and was never going to have any sort of impact on the performance of the team. Kupchack is notorious for handing out some of the worst contracts of all time and is likely the reason the Lakers had such a terrible time from the early 2010s until the point that LeBron arrived.   Jerry West is a great historical GM, yes, and likely the only front office figure in Lakers history I would call a great front office guy, but at the same time almost all of his success can be attributed to   1. Inheriting Kareem  2. Drafting Magic first overall, which literally any GM would have also done  3. Acquiring Shaq in free agency not due to anything he had done but because Shaq wanted to play in LA  4. Acquiring Kobe, which is the single thing you can attribute to his prowess as a front office executive.   To be honest, I really don’t care about any of your psychological or emotional feelings towards sports or the success of your teams. It’s nice to throw in for arguments sake and to really drive your points home, but I really don’t. What I do care about, however, is the fact that a majority of Laker fans, yourself included, are completely unable to understand or come to terms with the fact that  nearly all of their historical success, and all of their present success, is not because of the competence of their front office or the legendary abilities of their organization to build teams, but instead because of the simple fact that they are located in Los Angeles and have enough historical popularity that they can distinguish themselves from the Clippers to potential players. That’s it. You can sit here and tell me the Lakers are superior to the Celtics as of now, which is of course true, but you can’t tell me that it’s because of their front office or the competence of their organization. The Celtics have had a better front office over the past decade, which unfortunate doesn’t translate into rings for various reasons. Ainge built a lineup of Kyrie/Brown/Hayward/Tatum/Horford without having to rely on players forcing their way to Boston, and it isn’t his fault Hayward’s leg imploded or Kyrie became the largest diva of all time. I can only imagine the success the Lakers might be able to achieve if they had a GM like Danny Ainge in combination with their insane ability to be located in Los Angeles.   Also, I wasn’t aware that a ring, more playoff appearances, wins, and regular season wins than the Lakers over the past decade or so amounted to nothing in your eyes, but hey, your words, not mine. If you have a hard time understanding my stance on the current Celtics issues, please refer to the prior response in which I already described to you that, believe it or not, it’s hard for teams who aren’t gifted LeBron James and Anthony Davis to win things. It’s even harder to win things when teams like Brooklyn are able to do the same exact thing because of their location in New York.   I thought the condescension was a nice touch, I find it difficult to avoid when the person you’re trying to explain something to is either willfully ignorant of or just flat out incapable of understanding the blindingly clear points you’re attempting to explain to them."
So the Anthony Davis that exists in reality is not in fact a top 5 player then
"Cole Anthony, Harrison Barnes, Tony Bradley, Reggie Bullock, Ed Davis, Wayne Ellington, Danny Green, Justin Jackson, Cam Johnson, Coby White, Nassir Little, Theo Pinson"
Do the lakers have the championship factor?  If they do then your argument makes no sense if the Suns beat them. If they don’t then how did they win the championship last year?  Does only Anthony Davis have the championship factor?  If you had any actual analysis I might listen but you don’t.
"That was Anthony ""Ass Delight"" Davis getting his ass smacked, cause apparently he into that shit"
"&gt;Because the Lakers were getting a 5 year deal  They exactly were not, as I already quoted for you.  Here it is again, because you seemingly were unable to read it the first time.  &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, toldSports Illustrated's S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.      “Where he’s going to land? I have no idea,” Paul told SI. “And it don’t matter. We’re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We’re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can’t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.”      https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;so they could afford to give more  That's not how it works.  Unless there's another bidder, Pelinka is going to offer as little as he can, because Griffin's only other choice was to lose Davis in free agency for nothing.  There were other teams bidding for Davis, so by definition, he did not force his way to the Lakers -- they simply were willing to part with more assets than anyone else.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Raptors had to give up their franchise player for a 1 year rental of a player they didn't even know would be injured or not.  And they got Danny Green, too, who started every game for them."

"It was a horrible look for the Celtics after IT played through the hip injury that derailed his career. Basically torpedoed their shot at AD but Celtics fans won’t acknowledge that.   [I would never want my son to play for Boston after what they done to Isaiah Thomas,"" Anthony Davis Sr. told ESPN on Friday, referencing the former Celtics star point guard who was traded for Kyrie Irving amid his recovery from a hip injury. ""No loyalty. Guy gives his heart and soul and they traded him.""](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/02/01/ads-dad-id-never-want-my-son-to-play-for-boston/)   There’s a right way to trade a franchise hero and a wrong way. The Celtics move was widely panned by players."
"That was the year they got Kemba, right? Not that Kemba was ever anywhere close to Anthony Davis level, but he was still a solid point guard."
"Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis won't be forcing his way back imo."
"&gt;Anthony Davis also used to have a problem with injuries.  He still does, but he used to, too."
"crazy to me that people forget the lakers were coasting even with an awkward looking AD to start the season and lebron was an MVP candidate for much of the year with jokic and embiid up until his injury     then people are like HE'S OLD WASHED FATHER TIME FINALLY CAUGHT UP CAN'T COAST IN THE WEST     lakers got fucked by injuries, lebron especially     also the lakers roster like.. it's actually REALLY good if they're all healthy... but it's built  in such a way that literally one injury to any of AD, lebron, or dennis puts a crazy amount of strain on them     anthony davis is also a bitch for not playing center, jokic and embiid were mvps this year playing center and this dude literally makes the team play worse because he wants drummond at center and just fucks the spacing"
Anthony Davis expected to miss 4-6 weeks after seeing the injury
"Anthony Davis was part of both teams. I'm talking about the supporting cast.    In the off-season, Lakers fans were treating the swap of Dwight/Javale/Rondo/Green/etc. for Montrezl/Gasol/Schroeder/Mathews/etc. as a big upgrade.  Now, with or without AD, Montrezl was deemed unplayable in the playoffs, Gasol can hardly steal any minutes from Andre ""Butterfingers"" Drummond, and Schroeder can't even score a point in the most important game of his career.  Before insulting someone's intelligence based on their comment, it would help if you had the reading comprehension to actually understand the comment."
I think if he had pulled the trigger for Anthony Davis or James Harden they’d be in the finals last year or finals bound this year.
"Some of this is true and some of it isn't.  Sure, the calculus if you're in the front office for the Lakers is that if LeBron James and Anthony Davis are 100% healthy and the team makes it into the playoff, there's a pretty good chance that the team is going to win. I think that Schroder and Harrell or good players for the Lakers to bring in because those two moves are indicators that the Lakers successfully projected that James might need rest and might miss time due to his age and the reliable absence of Anthony Davis, who tends not to hold up physically over the course of a regular season. The downside to those two guys is that they aren't going to help the Lakers win too many playoff games, but those two signings I would say were successful nevertheless.  But I do think they whiffed on the center rotation and relying on Gasol and they would have been way better served keeping Howard like they wanted to, keeping McGee, or picking up somebody else with a defensive skill set that hadn't fallen off a cliff like Gasol did in 2020."
"[Classic](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/7/17326080/brad-stevens-celtics-sixers).  &gt; There’s not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He’s undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I’d take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he’s ahead of high lottery picks. I’d take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range. I’d take Stevens over aging stars like Chris Paul and injured ones like DeMarcus Cousins. &gt;  &gt; Obviously, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant would be selected first. And rising stars like Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Simmons would go ahead of Stevens, too. But are you really taking DeMar DeRozan ahead of Stevens? I don’t think so. &gt;  &gt; It’s tough to know where to draw the line, but there’s no doubt Stevens has proved himself to be one of the most valuable commodities in the NBA."
"It’s pretty obvious LeBron has declined. Being 36 and more injury prone, I’m seeing shades of Peyton Manning right now.   No AD, no chance. We all knew it already but Anthony Davis was such a crutch for this team. Even when he doesn’t play well the game isn’t a blowout. Just having his presence on the court demands respect from the other team to limit their offensive options in the paint. When Davis plays well, the Lakers look like the best team in the league with the exception of the Nets."

"It’s crazy how much of a crutch Anthony Davis is for this team. Even when he doesn’t play well like in game 1, it wasn’t a blowout.   When AD plays well, the Lakers look like the best team in the league outside of the Nets."
"That's really the thing.  Maybe owners have an issue with Rich Paul for other reasons.  But from the fan perspective, there's just a difference between:  &gt; [Charania] 4x All Star Jimmy Butler has requested a trade from the Minnesota Timberwolves   and   &gt; [Woj] Agent Rich Paul has notified the New Orleans Pelicans that All-NBA forward Anthony Davis has no intentions of signing a contract extension if and when presented and that he has requested a trade."
"That’s pretty much what happened. LeBron got the best roster he could manage after the Lakers traded for Anthony Davis, acquiring Rondo and Howard who ended up playing important roles for their 2020 championship run.   Now that they’re gone, they basically had to scramble for the best replacements they could, hoping LeBron and AD could carry.   Drummond and Schroeder are huge step downs from Howard and Rondo. Kcp has been injured and not looking like himself. And I’m not really sure why they extended kuzma."

You guys were losing by the time Anthony Boo-boo Davis had another injury. He was also a no-show that game
As opposed to Anthony Lakers jersey davis
Anthony Day-to-Davis
Anthony Day-to-Davis  : (
"Because you’re talking about health like the Suns aren’t dealing with when their leader is basically hobbled, and you’re only talking about your team which currently has a top 1-2 player right now. Your leader is still there, yet you disregard Suns leader with a relatively young team. A team with LeBron James and Anthony Davis is down 3-2 to the Suns with a young team and hobbled CP3. And you’re comparing that to the Heat, stay mad Jimmy Butler pushed your team to 6 and you lost some bets, admit it. Flukers."
"Considering he created almost the entire offense for himself, Yea he’s obviously the number 1 option. Anthony Davis scoring .1 more points because he’s spoon fed dunks and layups doesn’t make him the number one option."
It baffles my mind that people on here lose every ounce of critical thinking ability. How hard is it to understand that losing Anthony Davis hurts a team as top heavy as the Lakers?   I mean you must have thought a little bit when writing this comment right?
"it's time, Lebron. time to bring in the 2006-2007 JV hockey MVP, the richest soy man in Austin, Texas... Nicholas Michelle Polom to suit up in place of Anthony Davis."
Anthony Day to Davis
Anthony Day to Davis
Anthony Davis is hurt so much that he is in street clothes and not in uniform playing.
"Yeah that was ""this PHO team is living up to it's #2 seed and being a great defense team"" as much as it was ""wow, this LAL team is really, really bad without Anthony Davis and has no real scoring threat outside of AD and Lebron.""  2nd quarter started 26-34.  In the first 1:53, LAL had 2 turnovers and was 0-2.  Kuzma then got fouled and made 1 ft.  Score now 27-40.  In the next 3:38 they went 0-4 with 2 turnovers (one of which was a 24 second shot clock violation) before Morris gets fouled and makes 1 ft.  Score is now 28-50.  So through the first 5:31 of 2nd quarter, they were 0-6 from fg, 2-4 from ft, had 4 turnovers, and 2 points.    They finished the 2nd quarter 2-10 from fg, another 2 turnovers, and 4-5 from ft, for 8 more points, to end the quarter being down 36-66.  Outscored 32-10 in 2nd quarter.  Went from being down 8 to down 30.  They finished 2nd quarter 2-16 from fg, 6-9 from ft, and committed 6 turnovers which led to 10 PHO points."
This is only happening if Anthony Davis plays.
"""Anthony Davis is hurt more than Mary J Blige records.""  lol this man is a fool."
"He’s kicking passes out to completely out of rhythm players, sometimes with barely any time left and pouting when they miss. He’s not even bothering to make the defense work and collapse before kicking passes out. There’s no need to make excuses for him. The entire offense is designed for him to dominate and when he can’t they’re going to suffer immensely. Losing Anthony Davis just exacerbates the effect"
"A lot of the themes of MJB's music draw heavily from the pain in her own life(drugs/addiction, abusive relationships, mental health, etc.) Fwiw the shit she dealt with is real life heavy shit, and s/o MJB for putting her life on wax throughout her career. That shit is the opposite of soft.   But in terms of just pure slander for AD via the Snoop bar(""Anthony Davis is hurt more than Mary J. Blige. Records.""), I thought it was funny. Hope that makes sense."
"Lebron James mic’d up, encourages Dennis Schroeder to undergo experimental groin transplant with Anthony Davis “you’re worthless, but you got a groin and you ain’t using it”"
Anthony street cloths davis
They did it. It’s about organically winning and not manipulating the roster Perfect for your needs to win. Also winning the 1st ring in bullshit fashion to get the fact he couldn’t win off his back. Anthony Davis defense and length plus shoot touch is ridiculous and always ultimate for LeBron.
"Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis has a good ring to it."
"He wouldn't do that shit at a home Game 6.  Now, if this was Anthony Davis or KD we're talking about?  I'd expect that shit."
Bruh. Just like anyone else who ever won a title. Why is lebron or Anthony Davis any different
Anthony davis wouldn't have won if lebron wasn't on his team lmao
Anthony Davis is the perfect fit possible and in his prime. Legit unfair he was allowed to force his way to LA for LeBron. Drummond another guy they got cheap that’s laughable. Last year all these solid vets and tough guys to fill in for LeBrons soft ass. LeBron still hasn’t won a real ring. They all count as .5.
"So, would you rather have Anthony Davis rotting another year on the Pelicans? It seems like you'd rather Lebron and AD both suck on separate teams just so you can shit on Lebron"
"Should roll out all Klutch lineup: KCP, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Morris and Ben Macklemore. Low-key legit"
"Anthony Davis also used to have a problem with injuries. Some didn’t even considered to be a superstar because he couldn’t play out a full season in New Orleans. Those thoughts or rumours coming up before one of Davis extension  could cost millions. Drey can’t be apart of the talk at all, just doesn’t look good business wise."
"Anthony ""Bucky Street Clothes"" Davis"
"Sorry Charles, he'll always be Anthony Day-to-Davis to me"
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Day-to-Davis   Amazing when healthy, hope his career isn't affected too much with these injuries"
Anthony Day-to-Davis
"Ah yes, the team lebron handpicked and won a championship with only a year ago. Trading for Anthony Davis absolutely was the right move."
"Every team has injuries and must adjust accordingly to win in the playoffs. Yes, Anthony Davis being continuously hurt is a bigger loss than other players, but that’s the life you sign up for when AD is on your team. If the Lakers lose the series, then all Lakers fans should be saying is “GG Suns”, and not “BuT wE CoUlDa WoUlDa wIt aD!”"
"Skip bayless calls Anthony Davis, AD. Always Dinged.  I admit, that made me laugh."
"Anthony ""Street clothes"" Davis"
"Ur acting like this suns team isn’t a contender the second seeded team in the west. This was potentially the WCF matchup had both teams been healthy throughout the year, so acting like Lebron would have been bounced every year in the first round in the west is laughable. Also, I don’t know if you noticed but Anthony Davis is out. When a team going up against another contender loses its second best player, they tend to lose"
"Injured forward Anthony Davis yelled out, “There we go! There we go!” Bricklayer KCP gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard(apparently) Dennis Schroder yelled out, “We got no [expletive] squad now.” And before Lebron James hit the locker room door, former NBA great Lebron James hugged him and said, “Y’all trash now”"
Giannis should not be compared to KD. Compare him to guys like Kevin Garnett and Anthony Davis. He cannot be the central engine behind your offense in the playoffs but it doesn't mean he doesn't have MVP level impact.   He needs to be better than this though.
"it wouldnt be a scenario where the game is scripted and the outcome is determined before a series even starts. the most that can done is to favor a team with the refereeing. you can give a team an advantage over another team, doesnt mean that team will coast to the finals. unfavored teams would still able to overcome that type of thing. especially if say the favored team’s second best player on the team goes does with an injury. **cough cough** anthony davis."
"More like ""LeBron James, Anthony Davis to spend summer recovering"""
"I think Giannis’ game hasnt aged well. I think 10 years ago Giannis could win several chips going to the Rim and dunking.  But nowadays teams win by shooting 3s and making free throws. Giannis is a poor free throw shooter and a poor 3 point shooter.  Giannis is more durable than AD but he is also worse of Anthony Davis, because AD can hit 3s and make his Free Throws."
"Anthony Davis is a much better playoff performer, that's all that matters"
Anthony Davis
you spelled Anthony Davis wrong
Giannis is more Anthony Davis than Lebron  THere is no reason for Giannis to have the ball in his hands as much as he does. Dude should be unstoppable in the PnR and high post and such.   He's a 5 in the playoffs. Just like AD
Not unless the Bucks want to risk an Anthony Davis type situation down the line and completely tank the franchise.
"We coped by simply signing Lebron, trading for Anthony Davis and winning a ring 😎   Why don’t more teams do that?"
For sure. I went from watching Anthony Davis masterclass foul drawing to Jokic who doesn’t seek the BS like that
The Anthony Davis AMA was funny
"Trust me, Nets fans are giving plenty of credit to Ski Marks the Salary Dump God. Casuals may parrot the whole ""he got lucky superstars wanted to play in the NYC market"" but anyone who has actually followed the team knows just how much he had to do to get the Nets in a position where stars actually want to sign here. No ones gonna deny that the NYC market helped but lets not act like anyone could have put this team in position to sign Kd/Kyrie. There so happens to be another team in NYC with a more storied history that also had cap space that offseason but they chose to come here for a reason. That reason being Marks in 3 years with no assets of his own created an environment that was attractive to stars.  Seriosuly do people remember how dire the Nets situation was when he got the job? He had no Paul George or Anthony Davis to trade for a massive haul and start his rebuild. Legit his best players were Lopez, Thad Young, and Bojan. His next best asset was cap space (which he expertly used to get picks). NYC Market or not, it takes a special performance to turn that situation into a place superstars want to play in 3 years. He's getting plenty of credit from us."
"Suns are realizing that it was easy to play Lebron and Anthony Davis, but try to do the same against Austin Rivers, Marcus Howard and Facu Campazzo"
"Wtf is this stupid motherfucker talking about? If Anthony Davis was healthy, the Lakers would still be in the playoffs. This guy is a fucking moron."
Hopefully Denver takes out this fake ass team. Fake ass phony first-round win. They would be at home watching this if Anthony Davis was healthy. Healthy Lakers Squad sweeps those bitch ass Suns.
ESPN's Top 100 NBA Players of 2021 Season  1	LeBron James	 2	Anthony Davis 3	Giannis 4	Luka Doncic 5	Kawhi Leonard	 **6	 Kevin Durant**  L O L
"Giannis for Anthony Davis, who says no?"
Their big move was bringing in a guy who couldn’t make the playoffs most years while playing with Anthony Davis.  They treated their first round series like it was the NBA Finals and threw up the Mission Accomplished banner after beating a team that didn’t have a positive net rating in the regular season.   Mike Budenholzer is their coach.
What?   “Would you rather have Giannis as your first option or Anthony Davis as your 5th option?” The question is not Kyrie as 2nd or Giannis as 1st. Kyrie played like shit last time he was the first option on a team. His team made the ECF without him lol. Then he came back and lost in the 2nd round.
He needs a someone that can actually run the offense. Jrue Holiday isnt that. And that should have been apparent cause he played with Anthony Davis who needs the same thing
"Hes like Anthony Davis.  Can be the best #2 in the league, but really needs a legit star handling the ball.  He doesn't need defence around him he needs all star level offense."
Did Giannis join the group chat with Kristaps Porzingis and Anthony Davis or something? How did this guy get so passive overnight?
"I completely agree, but I’ve seen people on this sub talk about how the Bubble was so forgettable and boring, and I don’t understand that at all.   Did these people forget the insane back and forth between Murray and Mitchell in Round 1? Luka going toe-to-toe with the Clippers and making insanely clutch shots? That nutso 7-game series between Houston and OKC? The OG Anunoby buzzer beater and the rest of that 7-game series against the Celtics? The Nuggets coming back from down 3-1 AGAIN against the Clippers? The Bucks falling apart in one of the more surprising collapses in NBA Playoffs history? Bam’s game-saving block on Tatum in the ECF? Jimmy Butler playing like a superstar on the biggest stage and turning in some of the grittiest performances you’ll ever see in the Finals? Anthony Davis playing maybe the best individual defense I’ve ever seen throughout the Lakers’ entire playoff run?  None of that was particularly memorable to these people? The players were probably more focused in the Bubble, so I agree that it led to some better basketball and more competitive series."
"as far as the heat go they ran into a much improved bucks team no longer tethered to bledsoe and herro didnt have a ridiculous shooting stretch like he did last year and aforementioned anthony street clothes davis couldnt go for the rest of the series at 2-2, so while its funny, and i hate to defend lebron at all, i think there's mitigating circumstances"
"You talking about Anthony ""street clothes"" Davis?"
I’m sure that’s what Pelicans fans said about Anthony Davis until he signed with Rich Paul too.
Yes Luka and Anthony Davis would be better than Luka and Kristaps. Now give award pls.
He's going to the Lakers for a min to play with Anthony Davis and LeBron James? Holy shit. #LAKESHOW
I would hope the pelicans learned from Anthony Davis and Chris Paul
"*on year 2*   ""Okay, great. We're playing the Kings. Should be an easy one.""  ""*And now for your Kings starting lineup*""  PG: Patrick Beverly   SG: Klay Thompson   SF: Kawhi Leanord   PF: Anthony Davis  C: JaVale McGee  ""What the fuck"""
I said Anthony Davis would be an extreme bust when he got into the league
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"
Anthony Davis will be 28 years old during the next NBA Finals he could potentially play in.
"Because you literally have the number 1 or 2 best basketball player of all time playing for your team. Or did you forget? Also, throw in Anthony Davis in the mix lol"
"I don't understand the lakers hate this season. Last season the CLippers blew a 3-1 lead as the considerable favorite in spectacular fashion without injuries, while the Lakers won the championship. This season the Lakers lost while being extremely injured. If you told me at the start of the series that Lebron won't be able to move laterally well and will have a slow first step and Anthony davis will miss 5 of the last 6 halves I'd have guessed the Lakers lost in 5. There's a difference in those playoff losses, but instead everyone just goes ""HA! Lakers suck""."
And chuck calls Anthony Davis street clothes. KP is big and tall clothes?
His time in New York he could at least face up defenders and take it to the lane. His knee injuries really limited his ability to play face-up to the basket. He needs to develop a post and back to the basket game with better passing.  Anthony Davis who is 10 times better struggles with playing smaller than his size too.
Or Anthony Davis?
Luka is 1 Anthony Davis and 1 Lebron James away from being a champion. Trade him to the lakers. It’s the only way.
"My definition of superstar is that you can win a title with him as your best player and I think it should be strict. I won't call you a superstar until you have a ring in your resume.   For me the only superstars in the league right now are Lebron, KD, Curry, and Kawhi. Harden, Giannis, Luka, and Jokic are a championship away from entering that conversation, but need to win one first. I need to see it before I call you a superstar. Those 8 players are easily in the top 10 conversation though, and some would consider all 8 superstars. The question gets more interesting if it's simply a neat top 10, like would you consider Damian Lillard or Anthony Davis a superstar? Personally, I don't. But many do."
Anthony Davis
I agree. Damian Lillard is much better than Anthony Davis. Much more effective too. Also Ad is way too fragile. His body gets hurt so easily sometimes he's soft
"The guys in question health wise are Anthony Davis and Lebron James if that’s what we are talking about here then let’s agree to disagree. He’s not a bad Gm for resigning them   The new additions we got were all healthy this year   Last years team would have imploded without both of them, this years team treaded water"
Anthony Davis + Luka would be a dream duo
Yeah I think Rondo would’ve physically caught Solomon Hill before he dived into LeBron and he for sure would’ve caught Anthony Davis every time he falls
You know how Anthony Davis has gotten criticism for not wanting to play like a big man despite his length? Kristaps Porzingis has that syndrome dialed up to 11.
Kristaps Porzingis 🤝 Anthony Davis  Thinking they're a 7 foot SG
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
Anthony street clothes Davis ?
The Anthony Davis commentary is all too real right now
Anthony Davis
I had the same drive for the suns after the media said an injured Lebron and Anthony Davis would sweep. The media likes to pretend they watch basketball.
"To be fair, Anthony Davis was cleared to play by the Lakers doctors before Game 6, and didn't go so well."
Please for the love of god no Anthony Davis situation
Anthony Davis.
"Also Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis"
You’re just ignoring defense. Kyrie is way worse than Anthony Davis and probably about equal to Paul George if not worse when you factor in he’s a huge defensive liability against the top teams. Joe Harris is the only above average starter left.   Lakers and clippers have plenty of great defensive role players nets hve literally none
"I would imagine that Anthony Davis had another individual present to type out his thoughts and send them in response to the questions. It would make a great deal of sense in that regard seeing as most of these types of interactions are done for the sake of a sponsership or to promote a product they have influence with.  Probably just interview the guy like normal and let him answer that way I bet. Probably try to skip past the trolls for him. AD isnt trying to see the vid of him getting spanked 100 times.   Either that is the case, or rather he simply may be able to do as you say; type and talk differently for different scenarios.  Anthony is most likely a very time constrained individual, and thus allowing limited opportunity to respond to our curiosity.   So id say could be either. Also very possible Ad just had someone else do it for him cause he didnt wanna.  I made an attempt at typing this comment in alternation of formal and informal type to see if your theory could hold true. How well do you believe I accomplished the said task?"
"&gt;even Anthony Davis played like dogshit in game 1  He was also pretty bad in game 4 too before he went down. But yeah Schroder definitely deserves to get crap, but so do a lot of people"
"It’s awful against every player.  And no, not every big is awful against guards. Specifically, Giannis and Anthony Davis."
"Why? The rest of the team has been consistently trash come playoffs, including the coach.  ESPN love to lump it on Giannis shoulders because it's an easy and dumb narrative to hype, but he's had no help. The Raptors ended up winning the finals and Bud refused to switch things up when faced with the wall. And Giannis had no chance of beating a fit LeBron and Anthony Davis. Yet Harden has had much better help, regardless of the opposition.  Even in Game 1 v the Nets Middleton and now even Jrue, couldn't make a shot. I agree THIS season would be a disappointment if they go down to the Nets."
"...yup. even Anthony Davis played like dogshit in game 1. This scapegoating is really something when only THT and Lebron played up to expectations. Kuzma didn't look like an NBA player and Caruso shot under 40% last 4 games of series. Meanwhile Schroder has 2 bad games and it's ""fuck this guy"""
"Ayton was able to mostly stay out of foul trouble against Lebron and Anthony Davis, two players who are probably at the top of favorable calls in the league. So in that regard I think he can handle the job without drawing fouls, but you never know.  Also Ayton's screen game has become very good. He's been in real sync with Paul/Booker in that regard."
If an Anthony Davis injury is “unforeseen” he hasn’t been paying attention for the last decade. The Warriors are only going to be better next year with Klay back. The Suns and Mavs will grow a lot from this postseason regardless of how it ends. The Jazz and Nuggets will be great. They will need to improve if they hope to compete.
Softest player is a two way tie between anthony Davis and lebron. Giannis is actually durable and plays DPOY level defense
Better than Anthony Davis??
Anthony Davis would like a word
"Yeah lmao. Harden is literally one of the two “iron men” of the league with LBJ. Seeing both hurt is sad because they have been almost invincible for a year. Anthony Davis injures himself walking up the stairs, and even jumping lmao."
People already making excuses for the Nets with Harden out. Doesn't count if Chris Paul is injured. Doesn't count if Harden is injured. It still counts if Anthony Davis is injured.
Plenty of /r/nba was clowning Anthony Day to Davis
Um no. That’s Anthony Davis.
Anthony Davis
"When he went to the Lakers, there was no other superstar. It took a year for Anthony Davis to arrive."
&gt; I hope he does an AMA on this sub so we could treat him the same way and see how he likes it.  did you see how this sub treated Anthony Davis? LMAO
"I disagree I think the Lakers series was a letdown since Anthony Davis got injured. Before that, it was good."
Lakers... hear me out... with **Anthony Davis**
Anthony Davis for dame Time
How good are the Nets this year?  My goodness they haven't even had a hard opponent in the playoffs yet and you are talking like they are some unstoppable force.  And you are laughably dismissing how easy the Lakers cut through nearly every team in the league last season.   That was because of Lebron James and Anthony Davis.  Healthy.
"See for me 3 doesn’t makes sense, you can expect loyalty and then give none back it’s a business no one is tied to a team. I’ve seen Golden State fans want to trade Curry for some picks and players since he’s getting old. People want to move in from Anthony Davis because he’s hurt a lot. People will be oh so upset when Demar gets traded. But they’ll be on that bandwagon when Kawahi gets them the title. Loyalty is a lie, always have been, always will be. Really what’s being fought about it control. If the team can control the player great, but if they can’t their a problem. Also I actually kinda hate the narrative that Brown formed a super team. Like going to Miami, was I guess sort of a super team because it had three HoF talents, 4 I guess with Ray Allen at the tail end. But history is filled with teams that had multiple all star/hall of fame talents. The only difference is a team would make a trade. Again control, the mitigating factor is that it’s the organization making the choice. LA in it’s last year and current form also isn’t a super team. No Cleaveland team was. So at the most charitable to the argument, he had one super team and won two titles. But I still wouldn’t call Miami a super team.   Anyway that’s just my 2 cents. Though I dislike him primarily for reason 2 and a little for 4 after the China stuff. But that’s also super above my pay grade and making any judgement on that situation is disingenuous."
"Any bruiser from the 90s would eat him alive.  Anthony Mason, Dale Davis, Antonio Davis, Tyrone Hill, Oakley, etc..."
Anthony Davis........... Discuss!
Reading the Bosh AMA I was actually mildly shocked  how good it was. Was expecting another Anthony Davis type thread.
Yeah because having Anthony Davis is just not enough for LeBron James. At what point is LeBron just helping other people not the other way around?
"**Change for change's sake.**   Management: ""Hey, coach. You're fired.""  Coach: ""Why?""  M:  ""You have had to compete against better teams, and while doing so, you lost.""  C: ""But...""  M: ""Look, I'm sorry, but how did you not beat LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the champion Lakers last year? You have Dame Lillard and CJ McCollum.""  C: ""Umm... they had LeBron and AD. They were the champs.""  M: ""And then you lose to the Nuggets this year?""  C: ""You mean the team with the league MVP.""  M: ""Yeah. And don't even get us start about how you lost to the Golden State Warrior in the conference finals after upsetting the Nuggets.""  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR: The Blazers aren't that good and they won't be any better next year without a player upgrade, but they just fired their coach to make it look like they are doing something productive."
Are you surprised after how brain dead people got in here during the Anthony Davis AMA?
&gt;	Nobody can foresee a major player missing half the series due to injury.  This is Anthony Davis we’re talking about. Dude’s 28 and has missed half the games in his career.
I'd trade Anthony Davis for Beal and assets...He's an injury prone big who is not someone you want to build your franchise around. See his track record on the Pelicans.
"I know this is sacrilegious, but I'd trade him for a more durable star while his value is still relatively high despite his injury prone history. Anthony Davis is not someone you want to build your franchise around. His track record on the Pelicans is proof."
Anthony Davis has never won a playoff series (period) Bron has won it for him last year...
"You mean Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis?"
"Harsh but kind of true. They need an Anthony Davis level player next to Dame to be a real contender but none of those guys are available, and even if they were they don't have the assets to trade for them. The idea that a better coach will bring them any closer to a title is pretty naive.   It is really, really hard to win a championship, you need a ton of luck and an incredible team and sometimes you have all that but a team like the KD Warriors or a player like prime LeBron get in your way and you fall short. There's just no path to the Blazers becoming a contender anytime soon barring a Kawhi to the Raptors situation where they get one of the best players in the league for very little."
"Finally, someone asking the real questions. I think it’s supposed to be Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis"
"Portland is usually just the wrong team for its time. They might have been okay in 2017, but they weren't good enough to beat the Warriors. When Anthony Davis is healthy and in the playoffs, he looks like an all-time great big man. Stotts had to coach against LeBron *and* Davis in the same series in 2020, while the third best player on the Trail Blazers is a gracefully-aging Carmelo Anthony. They really shouldn't have won two series in 2019, but Lillard went off in that first series, faced a young Nuggets squad in the second round then got swept by the Brother Dubs in the WCF.  The Portland Trail Blazers were never winning a title, and they'll probably lose in the first round until Lillard's last season. They exist as an institution in a league that spurns institutions, and they'll never give Dame the sidekick he needs unless Carmelo turns back the clock."
"You predicted Kevin Loves struggles to adapt to life with lebron. We’ve seen Anthony Davis have success when his jumpsuit (lol, funny/applicable typo leaving it) is going but also have seen spacing troubles when it isn’t. Do you feel vindicated that you a) fit so well and b) had a hard af role to fill and did an admirable job.  Also side note, never blamed you for struggling against Tim Duncan in the finals. You caught the last spark of a legend who was playing better at 36 than he had since 31 due to health"
Was this one better than the Anthony Davis one??
Anthony Davis.
anthony davis really doesn't have good shooting ability. at all.
Never bet on Anthony Davis staying healthy
"This is all I’m saying! People acting like he has to be Anthony Davis or bust , nope… the Mavs gotta get him involved. The dude is capable of dropping 15-25pts. Get my man on rhythm"
I’d go  Curry Jordan Lebron KG Anthony Davis
"Fuck that, we have no bigs outside of Anthony Davis. We need Bam."
Anthony Davis. LBJ needs to ease back a little to stay healthy for a playoff run. AD needs to have a truly dominant season to elevate himself back into “best big man in the league” level conversations.
"You’re right. Y’all really shutdown Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, and Kawhi Leonard."
"For every LeBron there's a Kevin Durant lmao. KD absolutely loves Giannis' game, yet you're choosing to just believe in LeBron.  Also that has nothing to do with this, scoring is one thing, but in a game where he scored an extremely efficient 42 using an array of moves, even LeBron wouldn't dare saying Giannis isn't beneficial to his team. That's like saying Anthony Davis and Lebron aren't defensively impactful because their team was the best defense in the NBA even without them."
"Mobley has a very solid shot. Few 7 footers come into the NBA after one year of college shooting great from 3-point land. He’ll work on it but would be borderline shocked if he doesn’t add a respectable 3-ball to his arsenal quickly.   His weight is a “question mark” in the sense that he needs to bulk up a bit, but that’s true of like 99% of 19 year old draft picks.   The Anthony Davis comparisons are endless, but AD came into the league at 220 and Mobley is currently 215. This isn’t really a concern.   Mobley is going to be really good. I think anyone picking Green over him is nuts. I like him over Cade in many ways but wouldn’t go there simply because Cade’s floor is so damn high but they do have comparable ceilings."
His heel injury was very openly reported (and on the injury report) [but wasnt the only one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silverscreenandroll.com/platform/amp/2020/10/13/21514570/lakers-anthony-davis-undisclosed-ankle-injury-played-through-nba-finals). I think the thing is people dont care about injuries like that unless you are the losing team  Totally agree he shouldnt have played at all
anthony day-to-davis?
"Call me crazy but I'm taking Zion over anyone before Anthony Davis on this list. He's an inside scorer on 29/8/4 per36, 65 TS% - if he's on a winning team we're not shutting up about him. Then you remember that he's doing that while the spacing around him is so busted it's like they built the team to challenge him. He scores at will in the paint while the two best shooters on his team are barely breaking league average from the arc, Eric Bledsoe is his point guard, and offensively Steven Adams can only do nothing or bring a big closer to the rim."
"None of those were the Warriors' opponents top option, so saying top 1/2 is blatantly false..  In fact, that year Warriors faced 3 of the 4 other possible top 5 MVP candidates who were healthy.  But somehow people gloss over that.  It was a pretty hard path from that standpoint.  (Anthony Davis, James Harden, Lebron James.  And the other round had Marc Gasol as 8th MVP voting)"
"His tenure with the Hornets/Pelicans was:  Year 1: 46 wins, took the 2-time defending champion Lakers to 6 in the first round; after season CP3 is traded away after a vetoed trade would have brought Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic; instead the Hornets get Eric Gordon (the most despised player in New Orleans history), Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a pick.  Year 2: Hornets finish last in the West with a roster where Marco Bellinelli and Greivis Vasquez lead the team in minutes. Gordon only plays 9 games. Hornets win the 1st overall pick and pick Anthony Davis.  Year 3: AD has an okay but not great rookie season, averaging 13.5 pts in 64 games. Minutes leaders are Vasquez and Ryan Anderson. Gordon misses half the season. Hornets finish with 27 wins. Pels trade their draft pick which ends up being Nerlins Noel for Jrue Holiday.  Year 4: They are now the Pelicans. I buy season tickets for $200/seat (seriously!). Jrue is injured after 34 games and misses the remainder of the season. AD has a break out season averaging 21 and 10, but also misses 15 games with injuries. Gordon misses 18 games. Ryan Anderson only plays 22 games. Hornets finish with 34 wins. Pelicans acquire Tyreke Evans in the offseason via trade.  Year 5: AD continues to improve to 24/10. Holiday misses half the season with an injury but the Pels still win 45 and grab the 8th seed, but are swept by the Warriors during their first championship run with Curry. Monty Williams is fired, and the Pelicans have made the playoffs only once since then."
"I guess if you consider sports generations shorter than actual generations. You can make the case that Anthony Davis &amp; Luka are in a different generation than Lebron, Steph, &amp; KD.   Just like Michael, Magic, &amp; Bird played against each other but their careers overlapped.  Like Magic &amp; Kareem played with each other for years but most with the age gap people treat them like they’re in different generations."
Anthony Davis &amp; Luka Doncic? I mean they were both considered that by some before they were drafted &amp;  it looks to have panned out imo
"Still a very good player, mid-range master oh, I never felt he could be the best player on a championship team, I don't even think he could be the second best but I think he can absolutely be the third best player on a championship team behind LeBron and Anthony Davis since those rumors are coming out"
Throw in Anthony Davis and Luka and yeah basically that's everybody who I'd consider a superstar.
"If the Lakers have LeBron and Anthony Davis healthy they don't need Schroder to be that good, he just has to be playable. The Bucks need this dude lol."
"Dude had a good series against Portland a few years ago, a series Anthony Davis absolutely dominated in every way possible and suddenly everyone was like ""Oh he's always been geat, he's so underrated"". No fam he's just a decent player lol."
If anthony Davis regressed to the Giannis he would be a much better player... Big if true.
I feel like is Anthony Davis played a lot more like Giannis he would be a much better player
"PG: Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving (Efficiency is unmatched at guard, 50-40-90 club guys and champions. Ky was National Team MVP before)  SG: James Harden, Klay Thompson, Devin Booker (Need some D)  SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard (I mean....No explanation needed)  PF: LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Paul George  C: Anthony Davis, Karl Antony Towns (So many goods ones not from U.S)"
"In 2012 the New Orleans Hornets and the Cavaliers finished with the same record, 21-45. They flipped a coin which Cleveland won. The losing set of lottery odds gave the Hornets the first pick and Anthony Davis. Had the Cavs lost that coin flip, LeBron, AD and Kyrie Irving could have teamed up and created a dynasty to rival the KD Warriors."
PG: Steph Curry  SG: James Harden  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Anthony Davis
really?   Its easy to just sit there and spout out whatever comes from your brain-stems without knowing how it is in real experience.  Do you know what it's like playing in a professional team offense?  How about what it's like playing next to Lebron James or Anthony Davis?
"Starting lineup:  steph curry, klay Thomson (assuming he's healthy), Kevin Durant, LeBron, Anthony Davis"
"Plenty of #1 picks have not been the best players in their draft.  Hakeem, Kyrie, arguably Anthony Davis.  If your only measure of a top pick is that they are the best players from drafts, those would be ""unworthy"" as well."
"&gt; the list shouldnt be more than 3-4 guys a decade  Yet this one sub-thread alone is collectively arguing that Lebron, Durant, Luka, Anthony Davis, and Steph Curry are all generational talents while all making All-Star games together.  It's just too much and renders the phrase ""generational"" absolutely meaningless."
"I mean, at that point are we splitting hairs over what exactly “generational” means? In 3 seasons Luka made 1st team twice, and finished 4th and 6th in MVP.  Lebron in his first 3 seasons made 2nd and 1st team and finished 6th and 2nd  Tim Duncan made 3 1st teams in 3 years and finished 5th, 3rd and 5th  And it’s no coincidence that Duncan and Lebron combined for 9 championships for which they were at the anchor.  But, are Kobe, Steph, KD not generational talents because they weren’t consensus number one picks? If that’s the case then Anthony Davis is more of a generational talent than Kevin Durant, and that’s silly.   Luka has had the best first 3 years of his career in the last 25 years besides Lebron James and Tim Duncan. That’s pretty generational."
"Also a shame that LeBron James, Anthony Davis and LUOL DENG take up like 80% of the Lakers’ cap space"
“Ruffles without ridges is like Anthony Davis without street clothes”  I got the idea for this from the top comment in that YouTube video so I’m giving some credit to that guy lol
 Here are my predictions:  **Western Conference**  *Starters*  G- Stephen Curry   G- Luka Doncic   F- LeBron James  F- Zion Williamson   F- Nikola Jokic   *Bench*  G- Devin Booker  G- Donovan Mitchell   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- Paul George   F- Anthony Davis   WC- Damian Lillard  WC- Deandre Ayton  ——————————————-  **Eastern Conference**  *Starters*  G- Trae Young  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Giannis Antetokounmpo   F- Joel Embiid   *Bench*   G- Kyrie Irving   G- Bradley Beal  F- Jayson Tatum  F- Julius Randle   F- Bam Adebayo   WC- LaMelo Ball  WC- Zach LaVine   —————————-

"No, the ratings aren’t indicative of how good certain players are. Casual fans don’t keep up with the game like that. What I’m saying is when you say “people like to pretend great players are superstars”, I’m saying people call Anthony Davis, James Harden, Giannis etc superstars because they are superstars in terms of basketball talent. There are two meanings of the word and you’re referring to the media side of it. It doesn’t mean Giannis isn’t a superstar basketball player"
Mobley is closer to Anthony Davis than Bagley.
"Nobody draws ratings. (lol is this r/SquaredCircle ? )  Lebron was in the finals last year and the ratings were horrid. Ratings are down across the board. The fact that you could wonder into almost any sub and throw around single names like Giannis/Steph/KD/ect and everybody knows who you are talking about has to single some sort of prominence in the current world where ratings are no longer an end all be all metric. If you cord cut you don't contribute to these ratings. That is a large portion of this sub. If you read ""AD"" you are going to think of Anthony Davis even though Aaron Donald also exists at the top of a more popular sport or Adrian Peterson who has had the nickname for 10+ years."
Oh I remember how Shabazz Muhammad would’ve been drafted No. 2 behind Anthony Davis if he came out of HS in the 2012 class.
"Ok picture someone built exactly like Anthony Davis in an alternate universe where basketball and the nba don’t exist. Just, no one’s come up with the idea for basketball yet.  Where does he end up?  Now do the same thing with someone similar to the  6’1, 180 Patrick Beverley."
"I wish my Pelicans landed the #2 pick and took Ja Morant. The unhappy superstar pressure is too much for a franchisee that’s seen Baron Davis, CP3, Anthony Davis, and Jrue Holiday request a trade."
"Nets easily beat the Bucks with a healthy Harden and Kyrie. They almost lost against just KD pretty much.   Suns went to six games with the Lakers, and that was with an injured Lebron and decoy Anthony Davis.   Suns then played a Denver team with no Jamal Murray, the second best player on the Nuggests.  Suns then played The Clippers with their best player in Kawhi not being able to play.   Suns are now playing the Bucks with their star player having ligament bruising/sprain.   That's just off the top of my head. Pretty sure Donovan Mitchell was injured at one point as well as Conley. Joel Embid also had injury questions with his knees as well.  There have plenty of series deciding injuries that have happened right before or during these playoffs that have changed the entire landscape. Suns don't get past a fully healthy lakers, I'm not even sure if they get past a fully healthy Denver. They have had break after break after break."
Anthony Davis
Is Anthony Davis joining the Lakers ring chasing?
"Guys, its Dario Saric. Like, damn wasn't it convenient enough Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, &amp; Kawhi Leonard went down? Gotta go through some trial &amp; tribulations."
Anthony Davis has a sniper in the background
"Maybe but it seems like that's not the whole story here.  The Lakers in 2020 were kind of a super team, right?  With Lebron and Anthony Davis, plus they're a famous franchise?  Seems like part of the story here is also the post-pandemic world.  I think a lot of people stopped paying attention to sports, and haven't gotten back into it yet (or maybe never will)."
The Jazz couldn't beat a Clippers team missing Kawhi Leonard late in the series as the #1 seed and the Suns don't survive the first round if Anthony Davis doesn't get hurt.   The networks need to hype the squads with the best chance to win it all.
"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"Hush yourself, Lebron would trade everyone on the Lakers not named Anthony Davis to have a shooter like Cam Johnson."
Anthony Davis
the worst season in nba history resulted in us drafting a defensive specialist with our draft pick instead of Anthony Davis
"I am, because a sponsored AMA is against the spirit of what an AMA is supposed to be.  Obviously, AD only participated because Ruffles is paying him lots of money and NOT because he wants to answer questions from his fanbase.  What is the point of asking reddit to take it serioisly if he isn't going to answer your question (good or bad)?  Instead,he chooses to tackle the tough (staged) questions like ""Which two flavors of Ruffles Brand Potato Chips do you like to combine, LA Lakers forward Anthony Davis?""  [It's all just a shill](https://youtu.be/Z-DtANcWQnE)"
"What do you mean ""cover her ass""? It was in the leaked audio recording that started this whole thing. Why would she randomly lie in a conversation where she didn't even know she was being recorded? I'm not going to start thinking up conspiracies where Nichols purposefully didn't turn off her hot mic and had another ESPN staffer leak it to the press.  “Nichols discussed her career on a phone call on July 13, 2020, with Adam Mendelsohn, the longtime adviser of the Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James and James’s agent, Rich Paul. Nichols was speaking with Mendelsohn to request an interview with James and his Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, whom Paul also represents. During the conversation, she also sought advice from Mendelsohn because she believed her bosses were advancing Taylor at her expense.  I just want them to go somewhere else — it’s in my contract, by the way; this job is in my contract in writing,” Nichols told Mendelsohn, referring to hosting coverage during the N.B.A. finals a few minutes after saying ESPN was “feeling pressure” about racial diversity.""  [NYT Paywalled Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/sports/basketball/espn-rachel-nichols-maria-taylor.html)"
Hopefully this goes better than when Anthony Davis came and tried to plug Ruffles.
"I really hope the Rockets FO agrees and takes Mobley at 2 over Green so they still suck in 2024 and 2026  The new Bagley over Luka and Bowie over MJ.   Teams never stop going crazy over the ""do it all big man"" in a guard driven league when even Mobley's ceiling (Anthony Davis ish) isn't good enough to lead a team anywhere  I don't get it"
"&gt; Anthony Davis was better than LeBron last year for the first 3 rounds  Probably so, but we don't have any Best Player award for those, only for the regular season and the Finals.  If the FMVP was PlayoffMVP instead a few of them would change (Duncan in 2007 and maybe 2014 although possibly Parker would just switch from 2007 to 2014, Steph Curry in 2015, maybe 2004 and 2008 would change as well?)."
"Lakers fan saying this because their big man, Anthony “Street Clothes” Davis, is literally never back (from injury)."
"Anthony Davis was better than LeBron last year for the first 3 rounds. A lot of.you are obsessed with one aspect of the game, which is playmaking. It's the only thing a lot.of you can measure and see so you think it's the biggest thing that matters.  Media will.always favour the bigger name. That isn't an argument for why one guy deserves it more. Unlike AD and LeBron last year which was close throughout and both playing spectacular, CP3 has been inconsistent all playoffs with Ayton nothing short of.brilliant on both ends and on.the boards."

Jrue Holiday showing why Anthony Davis never won shit with him as the 2nd option
This makes no sense. You skipped Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard. Are you fing dumb?
Anyone wondering why Anthony Davis never won shit with Jrue Holiday is getting the full display
"And that's their fault how exactly? Not their fault the Lakers built their team around Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis. Not their fault that Murray suffered an ACL injury before the playoffs started, and sure as fuck not their fault that the Clippers built their team around Kawhi, who hasn't had a completely healthy season since the season his ankle got fucked up against the Warriors."
*Anthony Davis has entered the chat
"I’m so happy this dumbass made the worst possible move and picked the lakers seriously showed the world how low his IQ is. They already had Anthony Davis, Montrez Harrell, Marc Gasol, Kyle Kuzma, Markief Morris and despite not being a big man Lebron James needs to get into the paint to be effective. Andre the certified idiot thought the lakers would just drop everything and let him play over all these veterans who have developed chemistry with the team all season long. The part that makes it even more dumb is how many other contending teams were in need for a rebounding center like Drummond but he just seriously has no brain up there . You did this to yourself now go sulk in the corner and cry about it all off season long before signing a 1 year deal with the Houston rockets ya bum"
"Lakers won 6 titles, the spurs won 5. The heat and the warriors won 3 titles each. One title each to pistons, Celtics, Mavericks, raptors and Cavs   LeBron has gone to 10 finals and is on pace to be the most points scored all time. The warriors went 73-9 to beat the bulls record for wins and lost to LeBron on the Cavs coming back 3-1, THEN added Kevin Durant (second best player of the last 15 years) who they beat 3-1 earlier in the playoffs  Best players of the last 23 years are LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony , Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Steph Curry, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Paul Pierce, Dwyane Wade, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and others. young players such as Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Ben simmons, Deandre Ayton, jayson tatum, Ja morant, De’Aaron Fox and Donovan Mitchell are up coming and exciting  I suggust watching thier highlights and if you get deeper into it watch playoff highlights for specific years to see who’s good and how the different titles were won. I love this shit so let me know if you have any questions or recommendations on where to start"
I just don’t want to have an Anthony Davis situation where Giannis comes back too early. I want this series to be fun and healthy Giannis makes for the most fun.
"The draft lottery isn't rigged, and the Bobcats land Anthony Davis to pair with Kemba Walker.  Or we just draft some one not named Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  Or we accept that Celtics offer of four first rounders instead of taking Frank Kaminsky, aka a tall white guy that MJ loves so much.  Or a well-known one, the Hornets don't *trade Kobe Bean Bryant away*. Of course,big not, he would've ended up in New Orleans once they moved,bso technically he still wouldn't have much Kobe history in Charlotte basketball"
"You’re entitled to your opinion, just as I am to mine. I’ll take Dame over AD due to the reasons listed. They don’t call him “Anthony Day-to-Davis” for nothing. He’s an absolute glass cannon."
Because I think she’s stupid to refuse that offer and then she left Anthony Davis off of her All-NBA ballot for 2019-20 because she “forgot about him.” That’s the NBA Countdown host not putting AD even in her third-team All-NBA.
Anthony Davis before this season has always played over 60 games with the sole exception of 2019 where he got shut down early to preserve his trade value and let the Pelicans tank  Even if AD played 2 games every season he would still be better than AD. His injuries don't affect his play when healthy
"knowing a bit about their history I'd say that his Dad was filled with pride just at the fact that Giannis made the NBA. Giannis has gone so far beyond what any reasonable person would've expected of him when he first entered the league. Meanwhile, I still look at Anthony Davis sort of sideways because the potential that I saw in him versus what his career has turned out to be leaves something to be desired. Then again, if AD is healthy in round 1 and lets say the Lakers just clean up and get back to the finals, I'd be saying something entirely different. Would've loved to see an AD v Giannis finals with Lebron just playing a supporting cast member role."
"&gt; There's definitely concern, but everyone says this shit as though he and the team aren't completely aware of all these things.  This is what we said about Anthony Davis, but then he played 45 seconds and it was obvious that the Lakers team doctors are apparently just monkeys with stethoscopes taped to their foreheads."
"hOw dARE yoU cALL Me. AnTHONY daViS, a PR rObotO person  SalT N Vinegar RufFles baby~!"
"It's blowing my mind seeing a Celtics player say this about KG  Duncan was a '00s big. One of the _best_ '00s bigs, but he still basically did '00s big things (as you say he did them better than KG, who didn't have the strength to really succeed as an '00s big).  KG was like ... a mash-up of Anthony Davis and Pascal Siakam. He could guard on the perimeter, do some supplemental rim protection from the 4, play small-ball center if you really needed it (and Boston did at times during the title run IIRC).  I really think KG got shafted not just in terms of situation but in terms of era. Maybe it's just because I'm a Nuggets fan and he might be the best historical guy to put next to Jokic, but I feel like if you put Duncan and KG in a time machine KG is the all-NBA PF over Duncan, who also doesn't make all-NBA C over Jokic or Embiid."
bam/myles turner  anthony davis/zion  durant/lebron  harden/beal  curry/cp3  vs  Jokic/Embiid  Giannis/Sabonis  OG/Bojan  Shai/Bogdan  Luka/Simmons
Maria Taylor didn't remember who Anthony Davis was. Get the fuck outta here with your racist ass bullshit.
She didn't put Anthony Davis on any of her All-NBA teams last season because she forgot about him.
"Anthony Davis for most of his career, honestly"
"Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic all have nasty post moves, and they are all objectively top 10 players currently. Elite post moves are far from a thing of the past"
"You can only go with what you know at the time, and this whole sub was calling Ty Lue brilliant at the time for doing it. I guess he didn't foresee Anthony Davis' injuries being so relevant in the first round. And he didn't see the Mavericks as being a bigger problem than his other options, which, maybe they truly weren't because maybe we would have begun the playoffs losing 2 games to literally anyone. We'll never know now.  There are some things to regret and this is not one of them."
"Nicols is fine knowledge wise, she's just an insensitive dick.  Taylor literally 'forgot' about Anthony Davis last year for all NBA ballot"
"Oh my bad bro. Idk pg13, lebron cp3 Nokia embiid. Anthony Davis Steph Klay KD harden Lillard. Jayson Tatum and Westbrook. Giannis ah maybe he's number 15!"
"KD was the consensus #2 best player for a decade behind LeBron. Only being leapfrogged by Curry for a couple years. But he's been clearly head and shoulders above the rest. 4 scoring titles, 50/40/90 seasons, eye test as one of the most skilled players in the game.  Hakeem gets a lot of love from revisionist history. He was always a lot closer to Shaq, Robinson, Barkley and Ewing than MJ, Magic, and Bird during his playing days.  Hakeem from like 1987 to 1994 missed the playoffs, got swept multiple times, and was routinely at the bottom of efficiency among centers. He was a black hole on offense and considered not a great team player. During 1991 - 1996 he only made 1st team all NBA at center once or twice. People actually watching the games back then routinely put him under Robinson and Shaq on 1st team ballots.  Yes his B2B rings and playoff performance put him over Robinson all time. But any argument for him being top 10 basically ignores every year he played other than 1994 and 1995. 2 year peak is great and all, but it's weird to act like he's some untouchable goat candidate when he struggled quite a bit outside of those 2 years.  Hakeem and Robinson were closer to Anthony Davis and Giannis today, compared to KD who is much closer to that MJ/Magic/Bird tier of player.  Overall I'd argue there's a decent case for any of Hakeem, Steph, KD, and Dr J for that #10 spot. Despite what r/NBA groupthink says."
honestly they both suck at their job. maria taylor is an analyst and forgot who anthony davis is. call it how it is
They can try but it becomes an Anthony Davis situation
"You can only play the team that’s in front of you. We can’t spend the whole year making from of “Web Embiid” and “Anthony Day-to-Davis” for always being injured, then suddenly say another team’s accomplishments mean less because their opponents couldn’t stay healthy."
"Is Tucker the last old school enforcer?  The Davis boys, Anthony Mason, Ron Artest, Rick Mahorn, Ben Wallace, Brian Grant, Gary Trent, K Perkins, Zo, Rodman, Bill Laimbeer, Charles Oakley.."
This is pretty much everyone. Anthony Davis is the guy I’d probably put ahead of dame but I can see why people are down on him after this year. Healthy I think he’s clearly top 10
Anthony Davis can’t be the best player on a  team
"Small market vs. big market is definitely a thing, but it has less to do with what they can do with the cap restrictions and more with the flexibility of their championship window. A team like Utah knows they need to push all their chips in for these next few years because soon their stars will leave their prime (or just leave the city) and they will be stuck in mediocrity for another decade unless they luck into another superstar, since no FA will voluntarily go there.  Now the Lakers are in a bit of an unusual situation this year since LeBron will not be competitive for much longer and he is the face of the league and one of its biggest agencies and can easily tarnish the franchise if they don't build a team for him to win now. But in a normal situation, say if their stars were Anthony Davis and Devin Booker, they would not have the urgency to sacrifice their future for a slightly higher chance of winning now. If they let a role player walk and are a mediocre playoff team next year, they'll be fine. They'll have more cap space in t he following year and can sign any player that will be happy to come to LA. They can trade for any unhappy star on the last year of their contract without much worry that they won't re-sign. Even if they do happen to lose one of their current stars, oh well they'll get another one in a few years. They just don't have the same urgency that a small-market team has."
She rejected 5M so you know its kinda obvious.   I swear the only thing i know about Maria Taylor is that she somehow left Anthony Davis off the ballot for DPOY
I never understood the hate for Rudy’s game. Sure he’s not Anthony Davis with the ball but that’s not what the Jazz pay him for?? He’s a brick wall in the paint and holds up our entire defense so we can have offensive-focused shooters like Donny and Conley. Why is this a bad thing?
"Casual take. In what way is it strange? Which of those 2 things (us being underdogs and injuries happen) are false?   We were considered quite large underdogs going into the series regardless of being the 2nd seed, doubts of LeBron being 100%, and a very well documented injury prone Anthony Davis. A player known for being hurt that ends up getting hurt again doesn’t change the fact that we were still underdogs going into the series. You can’t invest in an injury prone player and then cry about injuries when the expected happens.   Maybe national media should take players made of glass into account before deciding the front runners and underdogs."
"I'm sorry but this is the dumbest shit I ever heard LMAO  Lebron has been healthy his whole career except for 1 groin injury and an ankle injury where his foot landed on a guy that would've hurt anyone   AD was dealing with Achilles issues   Did u forget Lakers only had 1 month and a half of rest after winning an NBA championship?  Lmaoooo u def don't watch the games and watched 1 series in which players were injured and the role players jus sucked and came to ur conclusión. Dont worry I know u will be silent when Lakers come back in first place like they were b4 the injuries    Number 1 defense in nba while missing lebron James and Anthony davis Lmao ""lack heart"" pls be quiet"
"Lebron played well but anyone who watches lebron knows he wasn't even at 80%. Hes lebron of course he can catch lobs with a bad ankle. But you are still hurt and u still have the thought of reinjuring the ankle when driving.  And I like the heat, but everyone knows that Lakers Vs Heat match up Heavily favored the Lakers..  You're talking abt Anthony Davis , Mcgee and Dwight Howard vs Bam Adebayo and a bench stretch 5..  Kcp , rondo, Alex Caruso vs dragic, and lebron vs butler   In that match up lakers were Heavy favorites. No one can say suns were favorites against lakers nuggets or clippers if both sides r healthy. Its all good. Even if they win 1 , let's see what they do going forward when everyone gets a full off season of rest and everyone isn't injured"
"He would get triple doubles in boards all the time. He’s a legit 6’9. Bigs these days are soft. I think he could totally defend and demoralize Anthony Davis, jokic, embiid, and/or giannis. So yeah. I think he could play as a big in the modern nba."
"I said   &gt;arguably a title contender  For a reason.. because AD was injured during a lot of the regular season *and* the playoffs. There’s a reason a healthy Lakers team was favored to beat Phoenix.   LeBron started missing extended games starting the Lakers 43rd game (starting March 21, and at that point he has missed **one** game) until their 70th.  From games 43-70 (**28 games**) Anthony Davis played 11.. that was games 59-69 (April 22nd-March 11th).   Lakers record through that span? 4-7. I guess my question here is.. why do you think AD carried the Lakers while LeBron was out when he missed more time and they didn’t win a lot when it was just him?"
"just imagine, what him, anthony davis, and lebron can do together? just imagine! and maybe add devin booker to it too! and hopefully giannis. this way, they won't ever have to visit phoenix or milwaukee ever again."
"Lol, never feel bad for the Lakers, we don’t deserve it. Also like Anthony Davis is still there (even if I have concerns with him)."
"Sorry minor slip up, she didnt vote for 2 All Defense and didnt vote for him for ANY of the 3 All NBA...So actually thank you for bringing that to my attention, because now it only make her look even worse.  Anthony Davis not All D or All NBA???? Please, sit down child."
Chris Paul  Klay Thompson  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  I built a team around him
"2010-2020.  PG- 2016 Steph Curry (One of the reasons why 2016 was a goated season)  SG- 2013 Kobe Bryant (Dude was an animal until his injury)  SF- 2014 Kevin Durant (I really wanted to put 2013 lebron here but KD gets the edge for being one of my favorite players ever and this was his best season imo)  PF- 2011 Dirk- (For his amazing playoffs run)  C- 2011 (Dwight Howard- Prime D12 was that dude)   HM: 2015 CP3, 2018 James Harden, 2013 LeBron James, 2020 Anthony Davis, 2018 Demarcus Cousins"
"They're not the worst market in the league (remember Minnesota exists) and they do seem to love him there (who wouldn't). But if they couldn't succeed with CP3 or Anthony Davis, I wouldn't have faith that they can do it with Zion. IMO he leaves when he truly wants to get a ring, no later and no sooner"
"Talk about a bad faith response.   Hey... if you think a guy (Sabonis) who is shooting 25% from the arc and 56% inside should take more threes, which is the position I'm arguing against, go ahead.   YOUR TEAM WILL LOSE MORE!!!!   If you want to trash me because I'm speaking to the duration of time that I've been watching the Pacers (literally decades), then cool. I was being challenged for not having followed/watched the Pacer; I outlined how long I've been following the team for.   You want to take that out of context, then you just make yourself look like an ass hat.   If you think McMillen is the reason they lost  in the first round last year, you go ahead and think that.   I'll tell you what though: They fired him, and shot more threes this year and shot them better and still weren't as good.   So it looks to me like the ""Tell the guy shooting 56% inside to step out and take more shots at 25%"" approach didn't work out to well for you.   Sorry about that.   The Pacers problem is their roster and their front office's conservative approach to free agency, re-signing their own players, and gambling on big risk/contract trades.   Sure... is saves them the agony of a one year rental, like Anthony Davis or Leonard.   But it also prevents them from gaining the benefits of those gambles, which the Raptors recently enjoyed.  But hey.... you go ahead and praise the firing of a competent coach who just turned that Hawks around and proved how woeful a decision that was.   Meanwhile, McMillan is laughing all the way to the bank, because he'll still have a couple more years worth of pay cheques to cash from the Pacers, whose front office was so dumb the had literally just signed him to an extension before firing him.   And next year, they can pay for THREE head coaches! :-)"
"I think Anthony Davis fits the Heat much better.  Butler can play the facilitator rule and AD can score enough to lead an offense, and he can stretch the floor enough to play next to Bam.  The defense would also be fucking ridiculous"
Healthy Anthony Davis.
If you have Anthony Davis on your team do you really have Anthony Davis?
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
"2022: Anthony Davis (IF he stays healthy and at the 5 for &gt; 65% of the reg season, and if he plays HUNGRY)  2023: Luka   2024: Luka   2025: Tatum   2026: Trae Young"
"Cade is definitely not a guaranteed all star lol. He's pretty much guaranteed to be a good starter but it's only those Zion/Anthony Davis/Lebron types who are *guaranteed*, and Cade is a step or a half step below that.   John Hollinger made a pretty convincing case in an article for The Athletic that Cade is #1, but not by the margin people think."
He should be making Danilo gallinari money but instead he makes Anthony Davis money
" tf? they got anthony davis and lebron basically at the same time, while in season 1 lebron was injured they won it with 2 superstars in season 2 when they had nobody the past 5  seasons"
There was some drum up of if Thomas Robinson showed up taller than expected at combine he could go number one over Anthony Davis.
"Andre Drummond is a guy that basically every team in the league would take for the vet minimum, a bunch would take for the MLE, and a few might take a chance on with a bigger deal if they had the space.  He's not a replacement for *Anthony literally Davis,* no shit."
Rose was the best prospect but really he wasn’t the clear best player until that title game where he had a good game and his team did not.   Anthony Davis I saw as can’t miss because he dominated the title game without shooting well at all. He also had good form on his shot so you knew he’d improve unlike Simmons who has always had awful form.   KAT only played 20 minutes a game but did average 10 ppg in those limited minutes. I always preferred Booker as a pro even though he came off the bench. His game just had the look of someone who would really succeed in the league.
Jimmy Butler led his team to the finals yet no one is saying he's better that Joel Embiid. Jason Tatum led his team to ECF yet no one is saying he's better than Anthony Davis who has no playoff success that time.
Yeah they got him because Anthony Davis left
Lakers can eventually amnesty Anthony Day-to-Davis
Anthony Davis put up 34 and 10 in back to back wins before getting hurt. He shouldn’t be on this list.
"&gt;In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.    &gt;The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.  &gt; &gt;22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable.  You are out of your mind on a lot of those.   In no particular order:   1) kyrie - this dude has done fuck all but get injured and be a cancer ever since Cleveland. This dude is whatever the opposite of a leader is. Kyrie absolutely shit the bed with a far better Celtics roster than what the hawks have.   2) Klay hasn't played in two years now. He's also not better than Trae young. Klay is a great supporting player, but he's not the type of player than can carry a team like Trae young has.   3) Westbrook? That one is absolutely laughable. While I have my disagreements with some of these players, Westbrook is clearly not as good as Trae young at this point in his career. How many times does Westbrook have to blow a close game for you to see this?  4) Ja Morant hasn't done anything to really show that he's on traes level. He's a good player. But he still can't shoot and it hinders his game.   5) There is no way in hell Rudy gobert is a better player than Trae young.   6) I wouldn't take Jimmy Butler over Trae Young. This hawks team is a worse roster than Miami had a year ago. And Jimmy Butler had a pretty forgettable year tbh. Maybe he bounces back next year.   7) CP3 is probably a wash at best. At his best he's better than Trae, but he can't carry a team like Trae can due to years of injuries and milage. Pick your poison. I'd take Paul in a single game, but Trae for an entire year  8) Tatum is debatable at best. I would say they are on the same tier. Same with Paul George."
"You’re 100% right, but “Exposed a bit” may just mean it shows he’s not Anthony Davis that can guard the rim and also close out on shooters (open by these wing failures, which could be explained by injuries slowing those guys and/or the clippers team comp/adjustments being their perfect kryptonite)"
"I mean...Anthony Davis was being sexually assaulted in a locker room and was being forced to smile and say ""I Love It"" into the camera. It was infinitely weirder than Steph and his wife having a kink. I'm kinda glad he got a pass, the video was pretty innocent in the grand scheme of things."
"In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.   The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.   22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable."
We're more into the homoerotic Anthony Davis stuff.
Anthony Davis with LeBron’s durability and Curry’s shooting
Anthony Davis has a million highlight dunks but his real value is how he plays defense
Where does Anthony “street clothes” Davis fall on this hypothetical list?
Yeah because he didn’t have anthony Davis to carry the load. He was relying on jae crowder as his running mate
They're an Anthony Davis away from a title. Contention? They would just need ~a Jimmy Butler.
"Anthony Davis led the Pels to the playoffs twice in his 7 years there, and he's generally seen as a top 10ish player."
They’re an Anthony Davis away from contending
"players who had a 55% TS this season:  - anthony davis - kemba walker - ja morant - siakam  players who had a 55% TS in the playoffs:  - trae young - ben simmons (wow, someone who’s range is 5 feet had TS of 55% this postseason, even though you called it horrendous) - tobias harris - beal"
"I'm always skeptical of top picks who couldn't win in college or were mediocre but had ""potential"". Wiggins won at KU, but that was largely due to Embiid. Fultz played for a trash U Dub team. Bennett was mediocre at UNLV. Time will tell on Anthony Edwards at UGA. Simmons played well on a mediocre LSU team that declined an NIT invite after missing the tournament.   Rose? Carried Memphis to title game. Davis? Won title at UK. Wall? Went to Elite 8 and won 30 games as best player. Irving? Went to Sweet 16 and won 30 games as best player at Duke. Griffin? Went to Elite 8 and won 30 games at OU. KAT? Won 38 games and made the Final Four at UK. Zion? Ayton? Won PAC conf and tourney title at Zona only to get upset in first round. Cultural revolution at Duke, easily dominant every minute on the floor.   Worth noting that Zion shot .680 from the floor compared to .560 from Simmons. When you are bigger and stronger than everyone else, you should be shooting better than 56% in college."
"Are we not going to look at how CJ underperformed in this year’s playoff as well? He’s historically disappeared when POR has needed him most. To me, they are both albatross contracts regardless. Offensive production from the guard position is legitimately the most overrated and saturated category of value in the entire NBA. Does Ben Simmons have holes in his game? Absolutely. The same can be said for CJ who’s a net negative defensively and adds very little outside of isolation scoring.  Ben melted down in the playoffs this season but let’s not pretend that with a change of scenery and a positional role more suited to his “unique” talents that he still can’t be a fantastic player. You as well as most the public underrate his defensive ability. He’s not a true 1-on-1 shut down defender like a prime-Kawhi or Lou Dort but what he does offer is positional versatility and the ability to seamlessly switch P&amp;R. There’s only two other players in the entire league that can do so effectively for long stretches of time and that’s Draymond Green and Anthony Davis."
Crazy. I became a mod after the Anthony Davis AMA
"Everyone always says this, I still find it to be mostly BS. You think other GMs don't know the situation with Ben Simmons in Philadelphia? If fans can understand this stuff, I'm sure GMs do as well.  If I can follow the league, listen to podcasts and read articles and know that the sixers, in all likelihood will look to move Simmons, why would a GM not? Anthony Davis put in a public trade request and the Pelicans still got a huge haul for him. Ben Simmons is who he is. He came 2nd in DPOY, is only 24 with clear areas he can get better in, and when he's on it he's a triple double guy who can make a spread offense look unstoppable. He also has struggled in the 2nd round of the playoffs, regressed at the FT line, and not found a consistent way to score even with his height advantage. THAT is who he is, strengths and weaknesses.  I don't know what quotes from Doc, Embiid, or the fans change about those realities"
"Dirk also didn't play a Portland team missing LaMarcus Aldridge (Lakers - Anthony Davis), a Lakers team missing Pau Gasol (Denver - Jamal Murray) or a Thunder team missing Kevin Durant (Clippers - Kawhi). On top of all that, Paul may get to the finals and avoid the Nets or the 76ers. Milwaukee or Atlanta, no disrespect to either, would probably be one of the easier finals opponents in the last 15 years."
How is Anthony Davis not a closer? He is 14/29 on shots to take the lead or tie with less than 24 seconds left. On no planet is John Wall or Gordon Hayward better options over him? [Source](https://twitter.com/tomhaberstroh/status/1307868722938474496?s=21)
"It’s about team chemistry. Can’t have your top 2 highest paid players at 37 years old with your third having the nick name Anthony street clothes Davis.    I’m guessing you wouldn’t know much about it since the last time you guys won a ring was… oh wait, never."
so like LeBron wanting Anthony Davis
You forgot Anthony Davis.  Trae has a good argument for top 15 imo.  Booker does not.  Just a worse offensive player than Trae and obviously neither of them are anything on defense
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
Anthony Davis was only 6 ft at fourteen…
"&gt;Paul George on Deandre Ayton's impact: ""Yeah, it's different. Ayton is a little bit more agile, more of a presence down low, and a better finisher than the other bigs we faced.""  That's cause the Clips tried desperately to duck Anthony Davis. They can't even deal with J.V. Davis AKA Deandre Ayton."
Like anthony davis does
"This is just not true on any level. The best ability is being a great player. I don’t care if Lebron takes off 2 weeks during the regular season because he’s a great player. And Davis has been healthy over the recent years except for this one which was a shortened season. I think it’s fair to put that one down to the weird circumstances of this year. To say he’s never healthy is just not updating your 2012 takes.   I just question whether people watched the playoffs last year and understand what this guy did on both ends. Trae Young is not better than Anthony Davis, that’s ridiculous."
"Ok I know we all love the PX bandwagon, myself included, but now we’re being outright silly. You folks are really saying CP3 is more valuable than Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis. Mind blown."
No particular order: KD. Kawhi. Lebron. Steph. James Harden. Joel Embidd. Giannis. Luka doncic. Anthony Davis. Nikola Jokic.  Who you replacing?
Difference is that Embiid is a lot better than Anthony Davis.
"Fun fact, Draymond had a higher 3pt% than Anthony Davis this year"
"Their players are so hard to guard on a catch. All of them triple threat but the ball never stays with them for more than a second. Then of course you have 2 all time greats on their team. Unless you have an Anthony Davis or Draymond Green type of defender in your team, your chances are slim."
"To play Simmons as your offensive 5, you need a very specific set of guys around him, because he’s not actually big enough to do that against, say Nicola Jokic or Anthony Davis. And even if he could, why would you trade for Ben Simmons to have him mix it up with other teams bigs and run the baseline looking for dunks. You can find guys to do that who don’t have max salaries."
These Suns ain't done shit yet and their fans are already talking. Too bad Anthony Davis went down.
"He got fat. I'm well aware he wears heating pads, but just looking at his face, you could see he put on a good amount of weight in the off-season. And he didn't lose it all by the time he was injured. Same with Anthony Davis. I don't mean ""fat"" like the Average Joe or Big Baby Davis, come on now."
"Wasn't he the amateur representative? I think he was included like Anthony Davis was out of Kentucky.  With two nattys and four final four appearances, he was probably the best candidate."
The ol' Anthony Davis treatment
"Take responsibility for Anthony Davis missing the last half of the series and LeBron himself getting injured? Bro what? His supporting cast wasn't good after Davis went down. It's not an ""excuse"" it's just what happened."
Are you arguing that Ayton is better than Anthony Davis rn?
Ayton was scoring on Anthony Davis
"He forgot about his 2 sons, Nikola Jokic and Anthony Davis"
Anthony Davis had a freak injury and so did Kyrie. They were both airborne and got clipped by or landed into another player in their landing space. ADs was more his fault by accident but Kyrie’s was Giannis’s fault by accident.
"I don’t see Steph playing. He’s missed the playoffs two straight years and carried such a load last season, similar to Lillard. Dame’s never played in the Olympics so this is his shot to do it, but a Steph/Dame backcourt with KD and Draymond on the floor would be unstoppable. If Anthony Davis was available, it would be a wrap as a starting line-up with Booker and Tatum off the bench.  I’ll guess Paul George plays if the Clips don’t make the Finals."
"Idk what ""shoot over Jesus"" means but Kuzma's FGA per game are way down. 15.5 attempts in the '19 season, down to 11 in '20 and '21 seasons. He shoots a lot less now than he did before they acquired Anthony Davis, so any narrative about him being a ball-hog gunner over his more talented teammates is just made up.  If anything, I think Kuzma has become *too* hesitant to shoot now. He's spent most of the last two seasons focused on improving his defense, which is great, but his offensive aggressiveness is gone now. I was frustrated with him all season for getting open looks and either hesitating or passing out of shots he really should take. He also had awesome chemistry with LeBron on cuts under Luke Walton and I would like to see Vogel try to bring that back into the offense."
Ayton got his well deserved rep for bullying Anthony davis into street clothes and Drummond off the floor in round one. Hes stepped up big time in his 1st playoff run
"Um, no Lebron stanning is what makes people like James Jones not get credit for his accomplishments and competence.  Or you know, Ty Lue.  Or Vogel.  Or Anthony Davis.  And the list goes on. It's insane to suggest that Lebron hatred causes people to underappreciate those around him when lebron stans often blast all the players/coaching/etc around him when he fails."
5 Anthony Davis. For obvious reasons 🚑🏥
"Problem that needs to be solved is multiple max players teaming up on one team while still paying role players. Sorry, the league is going to crumble if we simply let the top-15 players team up on whatever team cleared cap space and traded five first round picks to acquire the one star currently under contract (ie, Paul George, Anthony Davis, etc). Let the stars get paid while still maintaining space for role players. I cry zero tears for teams that can't manage themselves and have to be in luxury tax territory. Brooklyn gets three top-10 players in 18 months and we are supposed to feel sorry that they are paying luxury tax?"
Kyrie “Anthony ‘Street Clothes’ Davis” Irving
"Middleton doesn’t nearly belong with those other two names lmao. You’re comparing a two time all star to 3 and 4 time All NBA players.   Middleton wasn’t even an all star this season. Giannis was the only Buck nominated.  But sure, let’s act like Khris Middleton is comparable to Kyrie and Anthony Davis lmao"
"I mean when Anthony Davis, KCP, and Caruso are all hurt and the suns are the 2 seed"
"Healthy Anthony Davis imo is the best center for playoff basketball. Great defender on the inside and the perimeter, has good range for a big man, and is just versatile asf."
"Kawhi and Gobert above Anthony Davis defensively?   Only one of those 3 players won an NBA title while anchoring the entire defense, and it isnt Kawhi or Gobert lmao."
"No, it's not obvious. You could also be a disgruntled Lakers fan who thinks I'm saying the current Lakers are an equivalently stacked team to the Nets, and are asking who the third star is besides Anthony Davis and Lebron, and referencing Kyle Kuzma or somebody else with an embarrassingly bad shooting percentage.  Harden was obviously injured in this case, trying to bash him for having a bad last few games is a really bad look for you."
Anthony Davis is super valuable because he's a wing defender that also happens to be near 7' though lol
"Anthony Davis is far, far, far more valuable defensively than any wing player in the playoffs. Interior defence is incredibly important, but you need to be switchable."
"Yeah dude elite, he’s physical, strong, and has hustle. Even Anthony Davis had trouble with him last year."
How'd you miss Anthony Davis?
"Anthony Davis is always injured, nothing freak about it."
1 CP3 is the same as LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Look at how many rings CP3 has by himself and look how many LeBron won with AD. Proof is right there.
Better than getting sent home in the 1st round. Just a reminder that durant is better than washed up bum ass lebron and the lakers have a 190 million dollar roll of charmin on the roster named Anthony davis. Lmao
Did Anthony Davis choke against a 73 win team then go and join them? Then get upset when people criticize him?
"Umm, have you seen Anthony Davis"
Anthony Davis.
Trainer: But I can't control if Solomon Hill dives into LeBron James ankle or the fact that Anthony Davis is always injured.  Jeanie: https://youtu.be/CHzdxly0Y9Q
Yup.   Anthony Davis' dad was right.
"&gt; You’re right, that’s not his game. He can’t take advantage of size differentials, and we’ve seen that year after year against the rockets.  Which should be a major critique for a supermax player.  It's not like he had Anthony Davis on him and small ball isn't a new concept since he's been in the league.  He's a 7'1 guy getting 25M (with 35-46M a year coming the next 5 years) and can't give his team 6-8 points punishing a guy who is 6'8?  That is a problem regardless of how porous the perimeter defense was."
It’s Anthony Davis lol the trainer can’t bubble wrap him smh  Also LeBron’s was a freak injury
"Los Angeles Lakers head trainer Nina Hsieh reportedly did not have her contract renewed following the 2020-21 season, according to Dave McMenamin of ESPN on Saturday.   That followed a season that saw the team's players miss a combined 201 games, with high-profile absences from LeBron James and Anthony Davis during the regular season. The latter also missed time in the first-round playoff exit vs. the Phoenix Suns.  Per McMenamin, ""More changes are expected as the team is in the process of restr"
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
Anthony Davis...
Anthony Davis is the best defender in the NBA
"I am all on the Gobert hate train but I can’t think of 10 centers better than him lol  Embiid, Jokic, Bam, Towns, Turner, Vucevic, Ayton, Anthony Davis, and I can’t think of anyone else.  Even some of these are debatable to be honest in terms of impact."
I was just baffled that people put him in the same tier as Anthony Davis and Draymond Green. You never ever need to worry about them hurting their teams defensively but people somehow put Gobert over them both. Gobert's a very good defender but I hope after this he never wins over either of those two (if healthy) again. ~~which unfortunately Davis wasn't this year~~
"I can see the future. Last year the Clippers embarrassed themselves and didn't make it past the second round, Lakers won the title to rub it in the Clips' faces. This year the Lakers embarrassed themselves by getting shat on in the first round, Clippers will win the title to rub it in the Lakers' faces. Next year both will reach the conference finals and we will finally get the most epic battle of LA, way more epic than it was supposed to be last year because both teams will have won a ring by then.  LeBron, Anthony Davis, Kawhi and Paul George will all get 69 points each, and once we go into quadruple overtime in game 1 the universe will implode on itself and the world as we know it will cease to exist."
Andre Drummond then maybe Anthony Davis
Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis are the most unwatchable big men in the league. Literally just fall down every other possession.
"Well the best one is Anthony Davis, then KAT. I didn't realize Ayton was international but after KAT it's probably Bam or Turner yeah."
Anthony Davis??
"Not for Anthony Davis. Last year in the bubble it seemed like any time he would drive, as long there was physical contact of any kind with the defender he would get free throws."
"This is exactly why Anthony Davis is so good when healthy. Elite rim protection, can guard the perimeter as well as any guard and on top of this is a lethal offensive player. If gobert see even had half of the offensive capability as AD the jazz win this series 2 games ago"
"Boy the bloom is off the rose for Rudy. Biased take, Anthony Davis is a much better defensive player than Gobert"

"Would the Lakers be better off today if they had Ball, Ingram, Hart, let's say DeAndre Hunter, a late lottery pick, and their 2024 pick back?  I think they're *maybe* in the play in this season (but very possibly not).  They certainly don't win a title last year.  And in the future, they don't have a star to build around.  The Lakers got a title and are still likely in better shape long term with AD.  So, no, I don't think they gave up too much.    James Harden is 31.  Anthony Davis was 26 when he got traded.  Absolutely makes sense that it took more to get Davis."
KD is very close to having zero flaws tbh. Anthony Davis as well (when healthy)
"This is starting to evolve like the Anthony Davis situation in New Orleans - AD was loved in NO, expressed loyalty, got tired of management and ordered management to trade him. I think the same thing is going to happen in Portland, Dame will be moved while Portland can get something."
is that supposed to be more impressive than what DIrk did? I don't recall Dirk having an Anthony Davis averaging 29 with DPOY level defense
"The bar for first option on a championship team is incredibly high (you essentially have to be a top 5 overall player in the league). Incredible offensive players (like Paul George, Dame Lillard, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Carmelo, etc.) haven’t even come that close to winning as a #1 option. SGA’s shown exponential improvement, but unless he continues ascending to literally top 5 levels, saying he’s best served as a second-banana isn’t an insult."
Give Damian Lillard a healthy Anthony Davis and he would be a Finals MVP.
Anthony Davis trying to join the Inside crew as we speak.
Anthony Davis
AD is as soft as it gets at that size. Dude needs to go make himself uncomfortable. He’s an oversized Barbie doll trying to play among men. Man up Anthony Davis
"One from out of Left Field:  Dame Lillard for Anthony Davis.  Not remotely reasonable given LeBron and AD’s relationship, as well as the Lakers reputation for being good for stars, but part of me wonders if a more complementary star for the Lakers is a player of Dame’s skillset rather than Davis.   The Lakers have shown they can run a smart defence without AD this past season, and Dame’s offensive package is monstrous in comparison to AD’s- additionally the Blazers could look to either build around Davis or offload him for a full rebuild. Realistically, not too many other teams could offer a single better player in return for Lillard"
"Just posting to Say Anthony Davis is no where near a top 5 player in the league (arguably may not be top 10) and people saying ""LakErS hAvE 2 ToP 5 PlAyErS."" is fucking ridiculous."
Eric Gordon was a good young player (by a good margin the best asset offered in either trade) and the Lakers deal probably would have had the team in mediocrity that year instead of downright bad.   It would have been a lot tougher to get away with selling the rights to Anthony Davis along with the team if Stern had the Hornets jump to #1 from like the 14th best odds.
"I thought the head was initially ""Anthony Davis called out by Lakers Legend Anthony Davis"""
"can you blame them after they turned lonzo, BI and some picks into anthony davis"
Really? Because he did make tons of loyalty comments  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18699542/anthony-davis-says-here-stay-new-orleans-pelicans
Paul George? Anthony Davis? Come on bruh lmao
That isn’t a hard rule. Anthony Davis is a great player that doesn’t create his shot at all frequently.
"Magic Johnson on Anthony Davis: ""I don't think he's a Laker. I don't know if they're gonna sign him back or not, but I don't think he brings the winning mentality and attitude we need. To me, he failed in this series."""
Because I was cancelling them out with Anthony Davis.
"Mike Conley missed a singular game against the Warriors, and it was only game 1 my guy. Jrue Holiday played all but game 2. These injuries do not compare to Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, and Jamal Murray."
Dude I always thought Book would end up in LA with Anthony Davis but shit… even as a laker fan I’d take the next 5 Ayton years over the next 5 AD ones. Dude is a problem now that CP3 got him going. Chris Paul really saved this whole franchise from a reset in 2 years
Deandre Ayton is who I wish Anthony Day to Davis was
&gt;Lebron James and Anthony Davis
"That whole ""every run has some luck"" thing starts to run thin when literally every team they face is injured. Especially when it's the top players injured. Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris. Probably missing more, but that's all I can remember"
"Big men always get considered busts early because of how much longer it takes Thier games to develop. So many guards becoming stats day 1, bigs not named Anthony Davis ain’t doing that, games gotta develop"
I disagree personally.  While on paper I think the lakers would win..... the lakers got absolutely massacred and did not look like they were one Anthony davis away from winning.
"Even though I root against the Clippers, a potential PG redemption story vs Greek Freak's redemption story or Trae's upcoming are also gonna be interesting. The final 4 that we have right now have great story potential.  It's not like when Lebron is in the finals and if he wins he's the GOAT, or still 1 shy from MJ; if he lose he's the phony GOAT and we need to stop all comparison. It's boring hearing the same story every season. Heck, Anthony Davis won it last season as well but we barely even hear anyone talk about him lol it's all about Lebron."
"He played more games than Anthony Davis yet I don't hear anyone calling AD a ""non factor"".  Serge was the Clips 4th leading scorer, 2nd leading rebounder, and leading shot blocker.  He was also part of the Clips best 5 man lineup by far."
Call her Anthony Davis
"They’ve also been missing the player with more MVP votes than Kawhi, Anthony Davis and Jamal  Murray combined for half their run and are going against experienced teams that should be able to handle things on their own. If one player missing is enough to cripple your team then your team didn’t put enough effort into player development. The super team strategy of the Lakers, Nets and Clippers is a potent but incredibly fragile one. When you sacrifice stability to go for a glass cannon run with all your paychecks in one small handful of players, you are risking a flameout just like we’ve seen here. Teams shouldn’t be able to just buy their way to a finals, and only rewarding teams for winning against healthy players ignores the fact that developing a deep roster like Phoenix has done and developing team chemistry and a next man up approach is part of the process of building a championship roster. The Lakers, Clippers and Nets couldn’t be bothered with such things and they paid the price for it. Don’t blame Phoenix for playing the right way and winning games because they set themselves up properly to do so, just because some other teams didn’t."
But when you have Anthony day by day Davis on your team or kawahi who we also know has injury problems you are by default taking your chances and hoping it doesn’t happen
Lebron-Anthony Davis  Jamal Murray  Kawhi Leonard-Serge Ibaka  There’s the example. It’s not his fault obviously but it’s a pretty factual statement that CP3 has benefitted from injuries this year.
"Zubac channeling Anthony Davis in this one, can’t stay off the floor"
Bro what??? Ayton is good don’t get me wrong. But Anthony Davis is still in the league.
"Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard"
"Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray, Anthony Davis"
What about 5 Anthony Davis?
"Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Luka, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Steph Curry, Jayson Tatum, Zion.   16 players that we both agree are better or on the same tier as trae. I personally think there are more that are on the same tier but this is the agreed upon list. How do you not understand what I'm saying when i say that Trae is not top 15. Im a fan of trae i think he's great. I'm not hating on Trae at all. He's a top 20 player."
I still remember an article (Scoop B?) that New Orleans should take MKG over Anthony Davis because we had David West and that Charlotte deserved AD over us.
Lakers won't win another ring unless they add more talent.  Anthony day to day Davis aint it. Y'all got lucky with the 1 bubble ring. Be happy with that.
"Great article. Thx for sharing.  Obviously Nike did a huge mistake, but from their point of view at that time, he was considered at best in the same tier as Irving. They didnt had a blueprint how to sell a shoe of a point guard.  For Nike Kobe, LeBron, KD or even Anthony Davis were the Top Stars, they focused on at this time. They fit their profile of superstars making dunkings for posters. A player who shots 3s didnt sound that exciting at that time. They totally misjudged Currys potential, so did many others.  What interesting in the article is, Nike could matched the offer of UA and could kept Curry, but they decided against it. Nike is the top sneaker provider and their pride got hurt, if a player, wants to go to another company. Another huge mistake."
"ok?? who gives a fuck who the ""partner"" is? literally every ama has something like that in the post body... no one reads it and no one cares. this is not something that is remotely specific to the anthony davis ama. they all have something like that.  did you actually look at any of his replies? or are you just circlejerking based on what youve seen others say?  how are any of these answers not ""opening up and interacting with fans""??  &gt;My transition was pretty smooth. I went straight from college to the Olympic team with Bron, Melo, Kobe, Tyson Chandler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Andre Iguodala, Chris Paul. I was able to be around these guys 24/7 for about two months, and learn a lot from them.   &gt;My “welcome to the league” moment was when we played Indiana at home during my rookie year. They had PG, Lance Stephenson, David West, Roy Hibbert, all those guys. David West just lit me up. I couldn’t stop him. I was so frustrated. He went to the same move, over and over. Literally 5 times in a row. Just caught the ball, jab, jumper from the elbow. I couldn’t stop it. That’s when I knew the league was for real.  ...  &gt;I would choose the ability to teleport. It seems weird to be invisible and have no one notice you, and flying I don’t really care about. But being able to teleport and get point A to point B anywhere in the world would be the best for me. It would be even better if someone could hold onto me and we could teleport together.  ...   &gt;A guy I’ve looked up to a lot was Kevin Garnett. I always wanted to be like him, play both sides, be a fierce competitor. He was in the later part of his career when I came into the league but I always looked forward to playing against him too.  ...  &gt;If I’m back home in Chicago, I gotta have Giordano’s pizza. In New York, Philippe’s is a must.  ...  &gt;A little of both. They made me feel a part of the team. They welcomed me, they invited me to dinner. And then I got a chance to play sometimes, and they would coach me up. Most of the time it was just being shocked that I was even there, being able to share the court with them and win a gold medal.  ...  &gt;I was actually nervous. It’s a moment you dream of your entire life, and you reach that childhood dream...it was a lot. I was able to take it all in and embrace the feeling with my family. When I heard my name called it was one of the best feelings in the world.  ...  &gt;Just winning.   &gt;Winning it all with family there, and me just sitting back and reflecting on everything that happened that season, everything in my career, in like 15 seconds. That’s the picture that floats around a lot with me sitting by the bench, just crying with all the emotion coming out."
I would simply trade CJ for Lebron and Anthony Davis.
"read that comment again, it's a shot at all the people who constantly shit on budenholzer on this sub not a shot at the hawks  maybe you should go back to school in a state that isn't louisiana.  they apparently didn't teach you to read so good  exactly how mad did you get seeing anthony davis win a ring in a lakers uniform, did you throw the remote at the TV in a fit of impotent rage"
“Is Cade the perfect star to pair with Anthony Davis now that Lebron is retiring?” - ESPN
"I go through the all time list of these ""advanced"" stats that y'all bring up and wonder why you even use them. One(VORP) has stockton higher than Hakeem, KG, kobe, and KD. Just for starters. Another(PER) has Anthony Davis 3rd before Shaq Kareem Magic Bird. Posting those catch all stats with no context trying to compare across eras with no real explanations for the many crazy placements of players doesn't really help your arguments like you guys think it does.   And why are you using FG% instead of something like EFG% or TS%? Both of which Nash does have a higher percentage than Stockton in the playoffs"
"What’s funny?  You don’t think Anthony Davis and CP3 are in the top ten in NBA superstardom, as measured by talent and fame?"
"Lmao oh no you lost cam Payne? Wow that’s so impactful compared to fucking Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Anthony Davis, all of whom have better playoff track records than Booker lol"

There’s no LeBron without Jordan. The dude’s wearing 23. Lol. Even his close friends like Wade and Anthony Davis said in front of his face that the best player ever is Jordan.
"That's not what we're saying. If you have a player like Anthony Davis, who missed 155 games in his 9 Year Career, you should understand that his health is questionable, unreliable and as you say uncontrollable. This means, by getting him in your team you get his skills, leadership, physical ability as an Asset, and his potential health problems as a Liability. If you have an amazing player who doesn't play, you essentially have me, a guy who sits and watches the game. If you don't play, you're not that good. That's why Lebron, Dirk, Kobe, Jordan were so important to their teams - they played, everyone knew they play, that was their advantage."
"ah yes, when they went down 1-2 and got in rhythm against anthony davis' ghost. i like you guys as a team and all but you've been incredibly lucky"
No one is saying more. I’m saying today that have to have guard skills as well. If anthony Davis had grown without the skill he’d be kwame brown.
"And I thought the Pelicans situation around Anthony Davis degraded fast from ""Let's see how the season goes"" to ""Screw you, I don't want to play here anymore, but you have to let me stat pad."""
You ever seen Anthony Davis?
"Anthony Davis was getting no attention from scouts in high school and then he grew 8 inches in one year.  Then he became the top prospect in basketball.  That isn't skill, he just got lucky with genetics.  Big men are somewhat more skilled today than they used to be but they still pale in comparison to guards.  There just isn't an argument that big men are more skilled than guards, like zero argument."
"he never ""traded himself"" like anthony davis or james harden. and either way dame teaming up with embiid is nowhere near as egregious as KD signing with the warriors."
I still remember my friend who's a Duke fan tell me that Bagley was the best college player ever and was already better than Anthony Davis before he was drafted. Big yikes on that take then and even more so now.
"I mean - if you want to broaden this argument, if a players peak is in his 30s why is it that only 9 teams in NBA history have won a ring with an average weighted age of over 30 years old (weighted by minutes)? Where are all the teams of prime players in their early 30s?  So I'm curious, lets see how this goes... I'm gonna go team by team, and lets see who leads them in Win Shares by year and the age of that player...  While imperfect - the biggest weirdnesses balanced out (Kobe in his early 30s was clearly more important to the Lakers than Pau in 2009/2010 ... But Isiah in his late 20s was clearly more important to the Pistons than Laimbeer in 1989/1990).  If the prime of players extends well into their 30s... Why are only 12/40 teams led by guys in their 30s? 6 at Dirk-age-or-older (32+). Twice as many players are age 26-29 as are 30+ (24 to 12).  You start getting to Dirk's age at that 2011 championship, and title winning as a top player becomes clearly harder, only 1/4 as many dudes up at that age or older. You've got some great exceptions you can bring up... but the weighted ages of teams aren't in their 30s, and typically the top performer on a championship team isn't in his 30s. Top performer doesn't necessarily mean best player in the playoffs, but if the PRIME was as long as you say - it would make up a MUCH larger portion of this list.  2020 - Anthony Davis, age 26  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29  2017 - Steph Curry, 28  2016 - LeBron James, 31  2015 - Steph Curry, 26  2014 - Tim Duncan, 37  2013 - LeBron James, 28  2012 - LeBron James, 27  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32  2010 - Pau Gasol, 29  2009 - Pau Gasol, 28  2008 - Kevin Garnett, 31  2007 - Tim Duncan, 30  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27  1990 - Bill Laimbeer, 32  1989 - Bill Laimbeer, 31  1988 - Magic Johnson, 28  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27  1986 - Larry Bird, 29  1985 - Magic Johnson, 25  1984 - Larry Bird, 27  1983 - Moses Malone, 27  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22  1981 - Robert Parrish, 27"
Suns blowing out the Lakers when Anthony Davis went out. Or the Bucks beating the Nets in Game 7 despite lopsided officiating that favored the Nets
Rich Paul will try to do the Anthony Davis thing and force Simmons to one destination he wants but Simmons has 4 years left
To the Lakers for Anthony Davis.
"How many times was Atlanta nationally televised w/o playing one of the “4 teams?” ZERO  Media doesn’t know anything and can’t recognize the changing of the guards. The “10 players” media follows will change next year because they follow the hype and not the stats.   Nets will never win a Championship with Harden and Durant. They couldn’t do it in OKC with Westbrook. Yes, they were young at the time, but Presti knew he had to get rid of Harden even if Harden wanted out.   LAL, I don’t think I need to comment on this team. Lebron is GOAT but an old GOAT. Anthony Davis’ time has come and gone and nothing to show but his brow.   Warriors = old news  76ers has a player scared to shoot the rock, which led to their playoff exit and championship hopes.   LAC are too old to handle the youth of the Suns, and now with the Crafty-Veteran, Chris Paul, coming back, it’s a wrap.   Boston not worth “analyzing.”  Knicks had a great season that no one expected.   Mavs need help because Luka can’t do everything.   Portland needs to rebuild or get Damian some help.   Now for my team, OKC Thunder, we are doomed and cursed for breaking up the 3 we had: Harden, Durant and Westbrook. This year’s lottery proved the curse of the “Bambino!” FKN Sam Presti hasn’t been able to duplicate and never will. Everyone thinks he’s the GM with all the answers but it’s showing otherwise."
Never forget that MPJ has a higher standing reach than Anthony Davis. Combine stats are sometimes funky as hell.
Anthony Davis was playing on par/better in some series than LeBron last year..  Davis balled out and we got two wins against the Suns too.  I love what Trae is doing but people.love to overreact. This is that. Healthy AD is a monster.
"To be fair, any young, lanky jumpshooting big will get Chris Bosh-Anthony Davis-Kevin Garnett comparisons."
"There definitely aren’t that many bigs between Embiid &amp; Kat. I would take Embiid over Kat though, I think Embiid is probably the most complete big man in the game today.  As of how they affect their teams as well, I’d take Jokic but that’s about it as far as the Center position goes. Anthony Davis &amp; Giannis mainly play PF"
"How is this stat even counted? Steph had a game winner against NOLA over Anthony Davis, I guess this doesn’t count though? That’s the first one that comes to mind, he tied the game to send it into OT with that shot and they won in OT but for some reason if you construe the stats a certain way this doesn’t count. Okay cool."
Anthony Davis. The Lakers got a ring and the Pelicans got an actual roster
Anthony Davis kyrie and kawhi  yeah these guys are injury prone ever since they entered the league
Right? And if Anthony Davis finally shaved his unibrow maybe he could get an endorsement
More of a superstar than Anthony Davis and I do not wish to be @ed
He has the potential to be a Chris Bosh/Anthony Davis type of player from my understanding.  I think Green has better potential though as he’s said to be a Kobe type of score first guard (imo I wouldn’t even think it’d be crazy to take him first). He’s shown he can do it in the Gleague and it does look like he’s got the clutch factor.
Anthony Davis &gt;&gt;&gt;
"Anthony Davis was 222 lbs and is not listed at 254 lbs. Mobley should put on weight, but so do a decent amount of highly ranked bigs coming in. Embiid put on 30-40 lbs. JJJ put on 7-17 lbs. Rudy Gobert put on like 20 lbs."
Who was Anthony Davis' high school coach? He took AD from a guard into a dominant big. They must have a great program
"Mobley is basically Anthony Davis, who seems to be doing just fine in today’s NBA."
"Offseason focus  What is the pecking order in free agency? Half of those on the roster are free agents  Creativity in the offseason with limited options outside of their own players  What is the final cost of this roster?  Draft assets  First: 22  Future: The Lakers owe New Orleans an unprotected first in 2022. In addition, the Pelicans have the right to swap in 2023 plus an unprotected first via Los Angeles in 2024. The Pelicans have the right to defer the 2024 first-rounder until 2025. The Lakers can trade their 2021 first-round pick after making the selection. They are also allowed to trade first-round picks in 2027 or 2028 (but not both of them).  Cash: $5.6 million (to send) | $5 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  The Lakers have four players -- LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- who will combine to earn $102M in 2021-22. Along with the $9.7 million player option of Montrezl Harrell and their own first-round pick, the Lakers will enter the offseason $14.5 million below the luxury tax, but with eight open roster spots to fill.  If they elect to bring back their own free agents, including Dennis Schroder, Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker, they will be in the luxury tax for a second consecutive season. The total cost of salaries and luxury tax could reach close to $275 million.  If Los Angeles balks at the price of each player, it will have only the $9.5 million midlevel exception along with the veteran minimum exception available to use. However, the Lakers would be hard capped if they use more than $5.9 million of the midlevel. The biannual exception was used last offseason on Wesley Matthews and is not available.  The hard cap restriction still applies (the Lakers are $509K below) and will get lifted on Aug. 3. The poison pill restriction for Kyle Kuzma also gets lifted on that same day. Harrell has until Aug. 1 to opt in to his contract. There is no offseason guaranteed date on the $1.8 million contract of Alfonzo McKinnie.  Team needs  Starting and backup point guard  Bench depth at every position  Extension eligible: Alfonzo McKinnie  Free-agent status  Dennis Schroder | Bird  Montrezl Harrell | Player | Non Bird  Wesley Matthews | Non Bird  Alex Caruso | Bird  Ben McLemore | Non Bird  Andre Drummond | Non Bird  Talen Horton-Tucker | Restricted | Early Bird  Markieff Morris | Early Bird  Jared Dudley | Early Bird  Devontae Cacok | Restricted | Early Bird  Kostas Antetokounmpo Restricted | Early Bird"
"That team matches up poorly imo. You’re asking Anthony Davis, Draymond, and Bam to guard Malone, David Robinson, Ewing, and Barkley all being fed by Magic and Stockton. All 3 of the guys you named for post players are too undersized to be guarding 4 of the 10 best rim runners and post shot creators of all time. Steph, Lebron, KD, and Kawhi is a nightmare on the perimeter, but I think the dream team isn’t losing any sleep with MJ, Scottie, Clyde, and Larry Bird lol. The one clear and undeniable advantage is in the post and on fast breaks for the dream team"
"Anthony Davis is made for this team but alas, injuries."
Because nobody want's to miss Anthony Davis instead of Michael Kidd Gilchrist.
"We missed out on the greatest Olympic Men’s Basketball team because of the pandemic and injuries. Yes, better than ‘92  LeBron James Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson Steph Curry  Dame Lillard  Draymond Green Bam Adebayo  James Harden Chris Paul  Devin Booker"
"Anthony Davis barely played. They started Bron, Kobe, KD, Chris Paul, and Tyson Chandler. It was a team of all-stars plus a college kid."
"It really isn't.  I'm literally pointing out objective facts that prove that the ownership did not care about the team. Demps cared but was bad. The ownership did not care, and it's been reported time and again that they cared more about the Saints than the Pelicans. It's nothing new; these things have been reported over and over for years.  They let a shitty GM keep his job for almost a decade. That should be unacceptable for a franchise, but fans of shit franchises don't understand that. Anthony Davis was there for 7 years, and they didn't make it past the first round of the playoffs. That should also be unacceptable. He requested a trade privately, and not even to one team specifically. He just let it be known that he would not re-sign with the Celtics if traded there.  Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak ran their course with the Lakers and made a string of poor signings, so Jeanie Buss ousted her brother and brought in a new front office staff. What a fucking concept.  If the Pelicans ownership cared about their team before the AD trade request, they should have done due diligence and hired a competent GM.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOH/draft.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NOH/draft.html) Draft picks made by Demps.  THERE ARE ALSO CURRENT/RECENT REPORTS THAT ZION WILLIAMSON AND HIS FAMILY ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ORGANIZATION.  How dense are you? Of any fans who might understand lackluster ownership, you'd think it would be a Bulls fan  I am literally just pointing out reasons why AD did not like the franchise and did not believe in the ownership/front office. Why is that so hard to understand for you? If it were random, I'd be talking about a different team in a different sport to compare to the Pelicans, but I'm telling you things that actually happened and you keep saying the same thing over and over again. ItS RaNDoM"
"KD, Tatum and Lillard is more than enough for sure gold.   USA still won in 2012 with a 220 pound, semi-pro Anthony Davis in the squad."
I hope Anthony is Day-to-Davis for the rest of his life so it goes both ways
"&gt;  Remember as well, the Cavs have sucked since 2018, and they’ve been rewarded for it plenty of times.   False.  They've had zero lottery picks since LeBron left after 2018 until now.  As the Cavs dropped out of the lottery each of the previous three years, they were not ""rewarded"" for sucking.  Since 1986, the Cavs have drafted in the top 3 a total of..... 5 times.  In 35 years, it's been six if you count this pick (the lottery didn't expand to the top four picks until 2019):  1986 - #1 (Brad Daugherty) 2003 - #1 (LeBron James) 2011 - #1 (Kyrie Irving - *courtesy of the LA Clippers*) 2013 - #1 (Anthony Bennett) 2014 - #1 (Andrew Wiggins) 2021 - #3 (TBD)  The 2013 &amp; 2014 draft classes are among two of the worst rated classes in the last 25 years, &amp; Kyrie doesn't even really because it was the pick from the Clippers trade involving the Baron Davis salary dump.  If you consider being given the #1 pick in two of the worst draft classes almost a decade ago being ""rewarded"" I have some swamp land in Florida I'd like to sell you."
"In the two games AD played and was healthy, the Suns had no answer. Like AD didn't tear the Suns up right before the playoffs started without LeBron even playing...  LeBron was not close to fully healthy. Solomon Hill dove into his leg. He had a high ankle sprain, tried coming back earlier than he should have, and had to sit out another two weeks. NFL players (high ankle sprains are common in the NFL because of tackling) have said that it sometimes takes a full year to fully recover from a high ankle sprain.  It's really cute that you think LeBron is superhuman and shouldn't get hurt when a 220 lb  dude dives into his ankle.

"""*You guys are losing to a dude named Cameron Payne, come on!*"" - Anthony Davis in the huddle encouraging his team during game 3 of our series."
Anthony Davis kyrie and kawhi aren’t old.
"&gt;Yes, because Anthony Davis really had a chance to win a **championship**"
"Yes, because Anthony Davis really had a chance to win a championship in his 7 years in New Orleans, and it wasn't his trade request that finally forced ownership to give a shit about the team..."
"Again, people just be saying shit with NO evidence at all. He mentioned AD by name as a costar to play with. Tell me how we could’ve gotten Anthony Davis without including Paul George himself in a trade."
Lakers:   Overrated: Anthony Davis  Underrated: Alex Caruso  But they are not even close to the same playstyle or anything.
"Partially, Suns faced a Lakers team without Anthony Davis, a Denver team without Jamal Murray and now a Clippers team without Kawhi Leonard, it's almost identical to the Warriors first title run just with more star power being out. Warriors faced a Pelicans team with a hobbled Eric Gordon.... A Grizzlies team who missed Conley in the first game arguably their second best player after Gasol, fully healthy Rockets squad and then a Cavs team basically without the 2 best players after LeBron.  Overall it's about the same in improbability since those Warriors is obviously a better team than the Suns this season and the level of competition the Suns faced is skewed since the teams they faced so far didn't have their number 2 or even number 1 option in Kawhi. However without CP3 being out I guess it cancels out Kawhi being gone."
I’m still mad the NBA voted on a shortened offseason. The injuries have been HORRIBLE this year. I was so excited to see Jamal Murray in the playoffs. 24 and has to rehab his injury for at least 12 months. Anthony Davis and his knee injury. Etc.
Is Ayton securing his spot as the 3rd best center in the NBA after Embiid and Jokic? KAT is definitely more skilled and Anthony Davis might not count as a center?
"Last few drafts, best player...  2020: Edwards(#1) or Ball (#3)  2019: Zion(#1) or Morant (#2)  2018: Luka (#3) or Young (#5). Ayton was #1  2017: Tatum (#3). Fulz at #1 was a bust  2016: Simmons at #1 is probably the best.   2015: KAT at #1 is probably best  2014: Jokic at #41 or Embiid at #3. Wiggins was #1  2013: Giannis at #15. Anthony Bennett’s was #1 BUST.  2012: Anthony Davis #1  2011: Kawhi #15. Kylie was #1.   Out of 10 drafts, the #1 pick was the best player definitely three times. Maybe two more times. Twice they were a major bust."
"Imagine if ben simmons wasn't afraid to dunk. Even a borderline starter like zubac isnt afraid to slam it home. Ben simmons and Anthony davis are the softest ""superstars"" ever"
"Other than Anthony Davis, I got nothing. I mean, maybe 5 years ago I'd be listing Cousins, Drummond, Whiteside, and maybe Jordan. Small ball just does not work"
"&gt;No Lebron, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Beal, etc.  Most of these guys are rehabbing from injury/sickness"
"In what way does javale McGee scream best guy? No curry, Lebron, harden, kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Zion, Mitchell. Literally only Durant would be in the starting line up if our best guys were there. Thank you though for saying that our mostly b team is stacked."
"Anthony Davis or Draymond, who would you rather have on D ?"
Dante is on the ground more than Anthony Davis
Anthony davis
"In no realm does a 37 year old LeBron, Anthony Davis, and 36 year old Kyle Lowry take on Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin Durant all in their primes. The offensive power is just too great, Lakers can’t match their shooting"
To clarify- I meant Anthony Davis but idk if that changes anything
"Anthony Davis is never winning an MVP with Lebron on his team, I doubt he ever wins an MVP period. If Lebron is injured then the Lakers aren’t gonna be good enough for AD to win MVP. The highest seed AD has ever lead his team to was 6th."
"I got into the nba by trying the 2k games as I was bored. I enjoyed the game then started watching highlights and thought Anthony Davis was cool cause of his unibrow and became a pelicans fan. So just idk,watch some highlights and find a cool player"
"Why didn't anyone else survive the gauntlet? Milwaukee and Phoenix played multiple games without their best players. Depth and roster construction saved them. How's that luck? It's not like Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving getting hurt was a completely unlikely scenario.  Rather than trying to discredit them for being lucky, why aren't we saying the superteams were poorly constructed for being so top heavy?"
can russell westbrook play with lebron and Anthony Davis? He demands the ball too much. Wasn't a big criticism of him with Kevin Durant was that he had the ball too much?
It's too early to say anything will happen but it's worth remembering how far Anthony Davis took it to force his way to the Lakers. Would the Warriors give up Wiseman and the 7th pick for a guy who says he won't re-sign with them next summer?
What if that player is Carmelo Anthony or Anthony Davis?
"Didn’t learn until today that 3v3 half court basketball was an event, I would have LOVED to see a team comprised of NBA players.   Imagine Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson  What would your three be?"
Yeah agreed. But I kept hearing that every broadcast with the Pelicans playing. if he never had a growth spurt I wonder what he looks like. Lol does a 6’2 Anthony Davis make the nba?
"Clippers: Kawhi is out for next season.  Lakers: Lebron James is going to turn 37 this year and Anthony Davis is injury prone.   Nets: The only team that's likely better than the Bucks. And that depends on their big 3 being healthy. I am a Bucks fan, so there's bias in this, but I genuinely don't think the Nets will be a Great team going forward. I think they're too glitzy and have too many non-basketball distractions. They're top heavy. Irving and Harden aren't known as being good teammates. The players seem to run the team as opposed to coaching and management. And Harden/KD/Kyrie haven't yet shown how they're gonna play together. There's an unusual vibe with this team and they haven't had a solid season of finding a style yet.  There's an asterisk for every NBA champion every season. There are always aberrations with injuries, fluke one-game performances, significant referee involvement in outcome, etc.   But every season's champion IS the champion. Flat out. The champion is always on the receiving end of most favorable or least unfavorable aberrations. To put it another way, skill is a huge part, but so is luck with the winning team generally having fewer injuries and competing teams having more injuries (among all the other factors).   ANd still, I kind of agree with you. I don't have any great confidence that the Bucks will win again next season. Not anywhere near the confidence I had in say, the Warriors, during their run where they seemed invincible. The Bucks aren't THAT good. But it's also a little premature to say they only won because of injuries and that they're not gonna win again. They deserve more respect than that. They earned that title."
Anthony Davis crying on his twitch stream rn
"yeah that was a monumental fuckup on all sides, TBH. it was never even really marketed as an ""Anthony Davis AMA"" but actually a ""Ruffles Anthony Davis AMA"" and I wouldn't be surprised if he was not aware of what was really happening  then people rose up against the very idea that moderators would moderate questions  between the player, sub members, and mods it was a joke"
1. Kevin Durant  2. (Would be Kawhi Leonard but he injured) Stephen Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. James Harden  5. Luka Doncic  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Joel Embiid  8. LeBron James  9. Jayson Tatum  10. Anthony Davis
"oh shit it was RUFFLES, that's right! the ruffles AMA feat. anthony davis, i remember now"
Anthony Davis
Have they not tried to tap KAT/Minnesota on the shoulder yet?...  He feels like the next in line to pull an Anthony Davis move to get out of NBA hell but only bc he won't have any other choice
Trade PJ Tucker for Anthony Davis and convince Chris Paul and Devin Booker to take the hardest road and sign vet mins for bench depth
"Sign cliff paul, demar deGOAT and trade for Anthony Davis"
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Kawhi all went to LA and Brooklyn recently. Not to mention Kawhi left/forced his way out of 2 contenders to get to a specific city and he’s an impending free agent."
"Kyle Kuzma is a rhythm player, it’s simple. If he is getting inconsistent minutes he will play that way. People forget Kuzma was a decent young player before Bron got there, and he was serviceable in Bron’s first year as a Laker. But once they got Anthony Davis and made him into a 3&amp;D guy, you start to see the holes in his game. He needs consistency."
Anthony Davis looks great in his street clothes.
Anthony Davis has good taste in Loony Tunes themed shirts
And Zion is “have a shot” over fucking Anthony Davis   Look at Davis playoff numbers if he has another great 4-5 years with a Chip or Two
"Of course. They LOOKED unstoppable. Turns out they stopped themselves. It's not just Kyrie and Harden: Harris sucked, coached stopped playing Jeff Green after he came back even though he was playing well. They made mistakes too.   What if KD had played more than 35 games, or Harden/Kyrie didn't miss time in the regular season? They probably take over the one seed from Philly and things play out entirely differently.   Luka was amazing but his team didn't advance. Does that mean the Mavs actually won the title? What if Anthony Davis was healthy all regular season? The Lakers obviously have a higher seed and the entire West shakes out differently. It certainly doesn't mean that he couldn't have cooled off or that he wouldn't get hurt in a later round.   You've got to play the games. There's one champion and it's because they outlasted everything else that they and others were dealing with. Roster construction is a big part of that.  The best team in the East is by definition the ECF champ. Same with the West. To look at box scores and historical performances doesn't mean anything. What ifs are just coping scenarios and they always fail to account for any of the negative outcomes that could have happened if bandwagon players/teams had been better."
Yeah Kevin love = Anthony Davis easily
To our left the door creaked open and there stood Anthony Davis
"Okay, I'm deceased  Kyle Lowry  Demar Derozan  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Marc Gasol   Toronto duo gets their ring together with the man that blockaded them from Playoff success for half a decade..   sad nut"
"Okay???? When Anthony Day-to-Davis is actually healthy and plays, sure his big body is a better presence on defense. Big fucking whoop. You say that as if it is such a huge factor that makes him definitively *better* than Lillard, but it doesn't lol. They are in the same tier of stars.   Lakers win the Mickey Mouse ring in 2020 whether AD is on the roster or whether you replace him hypothetically with Lillard"
Ever heard of Anthony Davis my friend
"Yeah and if you listen to Gil, he never said Giannis wasn't skilled. He said he was the James Harden of the East Coast.   He was saying Giannis needed to round out his game and do more than just play 1 style.   It's not even a criticism Giannis would have necessarily disagreed with either. After LA's finals, didn't he say he wanted to learn more from Anthony Davis because he was impressed by his impact on the court?   Giannis went out and did a lot more this year and the Bucks moving away from a reliance on Giannis' ISOs was a big part of their offensive success."
"Here's 46-50.  **46. Deandre Ayton (Phoenix Suns)**  Deandre Ayton was one of the biggest stories of this years playoffs. He arguably outplayed two superstars in Anthony Davis and Nikola Jokic. After selecting him with the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, Suns faithful have been waiting for him to evolve into a star and it’s looking like he’s well on track to do so. He had his coming out party in the postseason, let’s see if that can carry on over to next season. Phoenix may need it if they wish to produce a similar season to this one.  **47. Jerami Grant (Detroit Pistons)**  Jerami Grant became the first option on an NBA team this year. But did he get better or did his numbers increase due to an increase in shots? I’d say it’s the latter. Grant established himself as one of the best role players in the game with Oklahoma City and Denver. He bet on himself this year in Detroit, and it looks like it did pay off for him. He’s averaging a career high in points despite his efficiency taking a hit. Look, he’s not super-efficient, his numbers don’t contribute a whole lot in terms of winning, but he’s fun and it’s good to see him doing well.  **48. Kyle Lowry (Toronto Raptors)**  Kyle Lowry is still a great point guard. Rumours were swirling through the NBA world throughout the season about a Lowry trade, but the deadline passed and he was still in Toronto. But now he is a free agent and the odds of him returning to the place he has called home for the last decade aren’t great. Lowry is on the older side, but the contributions he bring to the game are still very real. He shoots the ball well and is a top tier playmaker, exactly what a contender could use. But wherever Lowry ends up, he will always be a Toronto Raptor at heart.   **49. Malcolm Brogdon (Indiana Pacers)**  Malcolm Brogdon is a name you don’t hear very often. But the former Rookie of the Year is actually a very good NBA point guard who can score at a high level and playmake. His efficiency has taken a dip from when he joined the 50/40/90 club with Milwaukee in 2019, but that could change in a better role. Brogdon will be highly sought after by contenders in this year’s trade market.  **50. Michael Porter Jr (Denver Nuggets)**  Michael Porter Jr took a big leap forward this season, finishing 3rd in voting for the Most Improved award. Porter stepped up massively late in the regular season and in the playoffs with Jamal Murray out. He averaged 23.5 points on 56% from the field in the remaining 17 regular season games without Murray and then. Michael Porter Jr has elite scoring talents, he can score highly efficiently from anywhere on the court. The only problem is, that’s it. He can’t pass the ball at a high level and he’s a traffic cone on defense. But he is still only 22 so the sky is the limit for this guy. With Jamal Murray set to miss a considerable amount of time next season, Porter is going to be asked to step up in a huge way."
Anthony Davis fits rival in yellow way more considering how often they're compared
"Nah. I'm even more sick of people making excuses for us losing in the first round because of injuries. CP3 missed 1 game and left another. Exactly the same with AD. The series was completely even. We lost fair and square plainly because in game 6 LeBron quit on the team.  We should've and were perfectly capable of beating the Suns without Anthony Davis.  In the past two years, the Lakers, just by having LeBron, have not lost a *single* game because of a talent disparity. Every game the Lakers lost from the Anthony Davis era and onward has been because of effort. Hell we willed ourselves to victory multiple times while LeBron was hurt this season.   Also I know it's not your comment but how the hell did we ""blow up"" our team? Dwight, Rondo, and JaVale were the only guys we lost that played any meaningful minutes. Danny Green counts too I guess but he was easily replaceable. The only other guy I can think of, Avery Bradley, didn't even come to the bubble. The core of the team-- Bron, AD, KCP, Morris, Kuz, Caruso, THT, were all still there."
1.) KD  2.) Nikola Jokic  3.) Giannis  4.) Embiid  5.) LeBron  6.) Luka  7.) Steph  8.) Dame  9.) Anthony Davis  10.) Harden
[In the last 5 years AD has had 44 different injuries](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/anthony-davis-player-injuries)
"Game 4 Anthony Davis didn't play a single second of the second half. The Lakers were easily more injured at that point. Davis had 6 points total in that game. Meanwhile CP3 has 18 points in that game. He got healthier as the series went on.  &gt; The Lakers started with the type of ""minor injury that he played through, like damn near everyone in the playoffs does""  I don't this is the case for Lebron. Lebron will play through anything in the playoffs. Being available for his team in the playoffs is one of his proudest achievements. Donovan Mitchell missed Game 1 of his series with a high ankle sprain for instance. Lebron played through his high ankle sprain. It's not a coincidence Lebron has never missed a playoff game and it's not just genetics and luck. He has forced himself out there when others would not. Every other star player has missed playoffs games: Kawhi, Kd, Steph, Harden, Giannis, Lillard, Paul, Embid, Young etc. And those guys are babies who have barely played compared to Lebron.  &gt;The Lakers stars, despite not being 100%, still averaged more than 20 points apiece through 3 games until AD had that injury.  It was also the absolute worst playoff series Anthony Davis has ever played. And the absolute worse or 2nd worst (behind 2011 finals) for Lebron.   &gt;The Lakers were always going to be top heavy.  Right, so an injury to their guys hurts the team more."
You can't expect Anthony Davis to win with players like *checks notes* Jrue Holiday.
"Anthony Davis for sure, the sub just doesn't seem as the player he quite clearly is."
Anthony Davis right now
"&gt;clearly 1a, 1b  It was clear Lebron was the best player. Anthony Davis has been like that for years and it didn’t amount to anything. After making the playoffs twice in 7 years, his first year with Lebron results in a title. He’s clearly the number 2 on that team."
Or it means Anthony Davis (2017 ASG MVP) will be the next finals MVP.
"Look how this thread started. We were talking about the Lakers off-season.   The point is, the you cannot make any conclusions based off this season and 6 post season games where our team had a short offseason, injured at different times, hardly played together, signed Drummond late in the season etc..  The other point is, in the playoffs, a healthy Anthony Davis will play ~42 minutes per game at the center position. Montrezl Harrell is like the 8th man on our team. Rotations shorten. Our title hopes are 1% contingent on his play and 99% contingent on the rest of our players.   What do you not understand?"
"Giannis would have to spend a lot of energy trying to guard Anthony davis because no one else on the bucks can guard him. That leaves LeBron to feast on the combination of Middleton, Jrue, and Tucker. 2020 LeBron is just too much for the bucks and 2021 pre injury LeBron was in the argument for mvp. I don’t see the bucks winning either series."
"I think the Lakers could beat a fully healthy Nets because Anthony Davis is a matchup-destroyer who nukes small-ball teams on both sides of the court and the Lakers have great guard defense. Note that I said ""could"", not ""would""."
Would Giannis do that against Anthony Davis and Lebron?
1. KD 2. Kawhi 3. Curry 4. Giannis 5. Jokic 6. Lebron 7. Luka 8. Dame 9. Harden 10. Embiid  HM: Anthony “Glass bones” Davis
Wtf is Anthony Davis then?
So you’d compare jet to Lebron or Anthony Davis? Dirk probably didn’t have as much help as giannis. Middleton &amp; jrue are a nice #2 &amp; #3 compared to anybody mavs had
"Ok I’ll give you that, but 1 time when he’s already won 6 compared to Lebron needing to go to Miami then back to Cleveland when they had Kyrie and trading for Kevin love in his prime then then running to LA to play with Anthony Davis. There’s no comparison. Also Brady is the best QB of all time and Lebron is 4-5 best basketball players if that. Btw not a Brady fan, just realistic."
lebron last year (hell even anthony davis last year)  giannis this year  lebron all those other years.  durant twice.  shaq 3 years in a row.  tim duncan multiple times.  dwayne wade his first title.  kobe in both of his post-shaq.  y'all are taking dirk having non-all-star teammates way too fucking far.
"So basically there were 13 (qualifying) players who were elite this year based on the two stats that were given to be called an elite scorer and Anthony Davis, kawhi, Paul George were not on that list.  I feel elite should be less common than that"

I will exchange one Harden for one Gobert and collect my championships until the team blows up.   1 Giannis &gt; 2 Kyries and 3 Bol Bols. I'd rather have 2 Dames.   1 Giannis &gt; 13 Dwight Howards. 13 Dwights would bring so many baby mommas to the game we wouldn't have seats for paying fans.   1 Giannis &gt; 3 Sexlands I'm too tired for a good meme answer here."
Why would I want 2 Anthony Davis? I already got one injury riddled forward. Gimme the freak
"I don't know how we can keep putting LeBron as best in the league. Yes, LeBron won the championship, with Anthony Davis. Does anybody really think he could swap places with Giannis and win this year?"
"This whole injury debate is infuriating…Irving is NEVER healthy. Anthony Davis is very fragile. Leonard has injury and load management issues. All the players that got injured are literally all the players that are always injured.   There were a couple of one offs, harden and Murray. They’ve been relatively healthy. But the others? Their injury history has always been a concern for their careers…so I don’t know why everyone is shocked Anthony Davis and Irving were hurt, in other news the sky is blue."
"Aren’t u forgetting Anthony fucking davis? You’re ranking Rodman and Raymond ahead of him? I’d take AD over elvin Hayes, dolph Hayes, Mchale. bruh"
Explain to me how Anthony Davis and Paul George belong on this list. Neither the Lakers nor the Clippers are superteams.
Anthony Davis - George Mikan
"OK, answer this... which core three players has a better shot at a championship next year if everyone is healthy?  \~ CP3 + Lebron + Anthony Davis  \~ CP3 + Booker + Ayton  Doesn't the obvious pretty much address your point? It's not disrespect, it's just speaking to something better for him that's very obvious."
What was that old Draymond quote?  If he were 7 feet tall he’d be Anthony Davis?
"Uhhhh no. I'm going to name 11 guys, and then ask how the fuck you justify ranking Devin Booker ahead of any of them (in no particular order):  1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Nikola Jokic 4. LeBron James 5. James Harden 6. Anthony Davis 7. Joel Embiid 8. Steph Curry 9. Damian Lillard 10. Kawhi Leonard 11. Luka Doncic"
I mean the Lakers gave up more for Anthony Davis than any of the three guys on your team.
"Doesn’t this basically describe Anthony Davis? Now I don’t think he’d have made the NBA as a 6”1’ player, but he played point guard for a really long time and then had a very late growth spurt. Still handles the ball really well and shoots decently."
Trading for Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard are high risks?
Well they have a couple guys on their roster you might’ve heard named LeBron James and Anthony Davis that are currently getting the rest they need. I’m sure they’ll be fine
"Davis himself is a problem, but the Lakers as a whole aren’t. As the clippers showed our defense is really susceptible to teams that can run 5 very good shooters. The Lakers start 2 including Lebron. Rudy can just camp in the paint and cheat off multiple people. I’m not really worried about Anthony Davis shooting 3s all series long. And if he really becomes a problem we can run Favors at the 4 which worked very well in shutting down the Pelicans back when Davis was there."
"As a Lakers fan I always wondered why our fan base has such a bad reputation on Reddit and I’m starting to realize it.  Kyrie missing time doesn’t change what he did when he was on the court (54 games).  Or was Anthony Davis somehow unimportant for us this season when he only played 36?  Coincidentally, Kevin Durant also only played 36 games this regular season.  Say what you want about Kyrie’s durability but when he was on the court the Nets were a completely different team."
A healthy Anthony Davis is a nightmare matchup for the Jazz.
Anthony Davis and Kawhi would both probably do a really good job.
"All these teams wish they have a backup player that was injured instead of their all-star impactful player like Anthony Davis, Kawhi, Jamal Murray, Jeff Teague"
a great day for Anthony Davis
"Say what you will about Bron and KD being better but non of them has done what only Giannis and Kawhi did, in the last 10 years or so.  They won without a Star teammate. They both had great teams with good basketball players but they weren't Steph Curry, DWade, Kyrie Irving or Anthony Davis."
"First of all mj helped develop scottie. Per Jerry Krause paraphrased , ""MJ killed scottie in practice every single day. Made his life a living hell until he developed mentally and skilfully. There wouldn't be a scottie pippin if it weren't for michael"". (And vice versa of course).  Secondly you don't seem to realize his teammates dropped the ball multiple times either.  3rdly i love how you're intentionally comparing mj 2 greatest teammates against lbj's worst ones. That's completely disingenuous. You make it seem like kyrie didn't average top 10 finals ppg in one year. Or had Anthony Davis a top 5 player.  Or the year lbj went to the heat? He teamed up with TWO players that were top 5 in PER.     Anyway, the point isn't that mj or lbj didn't have help-- nobody wins alone and everybody had help (mj had more defensive help, lbj had more offensive help)."
I think the answer is Anthony Davis. But ayton is top 5 in terms of guys I’d want and he still got worked
"bullshit qualifiers? Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray and Kawhi Leonard not playing is ""bullshit""?  you really think under normal circumstances that they get to the finals? really dude?  and how young are they really with 36 year old injury prone CP3 as their engine?"
"some of those challenges were quite funny tbh, e.g. he challenged blake griffin to stay healthy, anthony davis to demand a trade and derozan to ""to rekindle a lost friendship from your youth"""
"What, you don't like Giannis's ability to barely rattle in a 3, thus giving him the confidence to brick the next 10?  But yeah, in case it wasn't clear, I don't think Giannis has a *good* chance.  But he has *a* chance.  And I think there's value in delineating between a guy like Giannis who has *a* chance versus a guy like Anthony Davis who's an All-Pro, one of the best players in the league, but I think has absolutely zero chance of catching Duncan"
"LeBron is the master of this stuff   I read some people saying ""oh wade was washed up in 2013 and 2014"" or ""oh he carried a bad cavs team in 2018"". Come on. The day that he made his decision in 2010 was like a nuclear bomb hit the sports world. Wade and Bosh were both top 10 players. Nobody could have predicted Wade's demise would be quicker than usual. His tenure at heat does not seem to be a huge failure thanks to a miracle shot by Jesus.    And he left that team with an incredible pr to join Cavs. I am pretty sure with the help of his agency, all things were in place regarding Kevin Love -a top 20 player at that time btw. He could not have predicted Kyrie's weirdness but he formed another super team just in a span of 4 years.    Yes, 2020 Lakers were not a super team. But the fact that he could have teamed up with Anthony Davis is also something no other player can do. Davis simply blocked any other team to move for him other than Lakers. If you think that does not have anything to do with, well simply LeBron having an AGENCY, I don't know what to say.    Yes, KD's move was weak. But, LeBron is the master of this stuff."

Go look at Anthony Davis list of injuries every year. He's never healthy
"Like Saric is more important than Anthony Davis, Jamal Murray, or Kahwi"
"(Even relative to other teams) I think he was a nightmare match-up for y'all, even more so than how many predicted Anthony Davis would have been."
I mean if you want to give him props sure but don’t act like Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard existed in this playoff run then
Casual fans haven’t realized it yet but you’re absolutely right. I knew from the moment he won his second MVP that this man will not just be another superstar like a James Harden or an Anthony Davis. We are literally looking at a man who has potential to enter the top 10 debate at the BARE MINIMUM if not top 5 debate depending on if he continues on an upward trajectory past his prime or not.
I'm Anthony Davis and this comment is brought to you by Ruffles™
wont have enough next year. Maybe if y'all get lucky with Anthony davis getting injured again and lebron playing hurt...
Anthony Davis stinks now right? He’s a scrub???
"TMac and Anthony Davis’ wife are the only 2 to complain about the weather/culture change/metric system. Lol So many players absolutely love TO either playing here or visiting. The city is one of the most culturally diverse in the world. As for the weather yes we have cold winters, but we also have summers that are just as hot as Florida. (I sound like a tourism video. My bad) But him, Suggs, Giddy, Kuminga and a few others all expressed their interest to come to Toronto for the player development and other aspects"
Anthony Davis shot like 47% from midrange in the bubble. He's never touching that again
"The Lakers acquired an All NBA caliber talent in exchange for very replaceable role players while retaining their mid-level exception and avoiding the hard cap. They still also have bird rights on other role players such as Caruso, THT, and Schroeder, which can all be signed-and-traded for more players.  Stop focusing on perimeter shooting and look at all the great things he does for the team because the shooting can come from elsewhere.   WB permits LeBron to sit on the bench for 30 seconds without our offense turning to dog shit. WB gives us injury insurance in case one of our other stars goes down. Westbrook can unlock a lot of Anthony Davis’ fast break offense that we show cased in 2020. Westbrook is actually a good defender statistically and will likely improve to a fantastic defender within Vogel‘a system. Westbrook is one of the best leaders in the NBA and is almost always referred to as an ideal teammate by every star he plays with. Beal said WB was the best teammate he’s ever had after just one year. Westbrook makes his teammates better statistically so the role players we have like Caruso and Gasol will likely have better offensive stats than they did previously. Westbrook dresses fly and will pass Vogel’s all important “swag test”.  What more do you need? We have shooters at home."
"You don't realize that Russell motherfucking Westbrook is now a Los Angeles Laker alongside LeBron fucking James and Anthony mcfucking Davis. Too bad Kawhi is sitting the season out, the WCF would absolutely be the Battle of LA and it would have been glorious"
"&gt;\[Holmes\] Anthony Davis on rumors that he and Russell Westbrook might one day join the Lakers: ""I haven't talked to Russell or whoever the source is about that so I'm not sure where this came from but I'm here. I just signed an extension here.""  Anthony Davis four years ago lol  [Source](https://twitter.com/Baxter/status/832331534761734144)"
Now imagine instead of PJ Tucker and Harden you have Lebron James and Anthony Davis as your guys.   Sounds like a decent combo come playoff time.
"No, I intend on Anthony off the bench   I’d go WB, Green, James, Davis, Gasol and sprinkle in anthony morris caruso matthews as needed. Bench will comprise of mainly small ball and Davis at 5. This roster would need another organizer unless caruso takes big steps on offense. Situationally I can also see caruso subbing in for Westbrook on defense.  I’d close with caruso green Westbrook james Davis in a vacuum and swap caruso with Anthony for shooting."
Where does Anthony Davis fit in to all of this ?
The rest of the roster isn't even filled out lmao.   You guys said the same shit when we traded for Anthony Davis.   Gotta love the reddit GMs that play once a week in a pick-up-game playing the know it all game before we've even seen a team play a game together or have a full roster.
anthony street clothes davis 😂
Laughs in Lebron James and Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis in street clothes
Anthony Davis
"Bro, do you realize the other two players are Lebron James and Anthony Davis?"
I'm not saying we're certainly going to win the 2022 Championshop   #But it's the dumbest take in the multiverse to say that a team with LEBRON JAMES AND ANTHONY DAVIS killed ANY CHANCE OF WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP through a trade that didn't move either of those players!    # Any team with 2 healthy top 10 players  has a good chance at a title and the Lakers are one of how many?   I mean cmon lol

"without looking, how old do you think anthony davis is"
"I mean not really, AD &amp; LeBron actually fit together well, and Harrell &amp; Schroeder was considered a talent upgrade to Dwight/DG until it happened. the team last year was a way better fit with less talent than this seasons team, now your best floor spacer who can play more than 20 minutes a game is Anthony Davis.."
“Lakers traded their whole young core and picks for injury prone Anthony Davis”  “Lakers have 3 players on their roster after trading their young core”  You guys make these comments every year.
"People already forgot what a healthy LeBron-Anthony Davis duo looked like and now they got a legit playmaker + attacker/cutter with them as well  It's always like that, people just saw a team lose and without context act like they're bad already and need a super big change to be contenders. They just need to get healthy again."
"It’s tough to fuck up a team with LeBron and Anthony Davis that has already won a championship, but they’ve gone and done it."
Anthony Davis??
"Lol. However, when those 3 players are Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook your wiggle room for role players starts to open up"
Lebron James and Anthony Davis are the 2nd and 3rd highest paid Lakers.
Westbrook hasn't been a star in years lol the Lakers are basically just 2 geriatrics and Anthony Davis
He's gonna play with Anthony Davis 😂 if you don't see how that's trouble for other teams idk what to tell you.
"BREAKING: 76ers wanted Lebron James,  Anthony Davis, AND Kostas Antetokoumpo for Ben Simmons. Was quoted saying “Lakers want a PG they’ll get one.”"
In the 25 games Anthony Davis is healthy for
"Anthony Davis is constantly injured. Usually minor, but he’s had so many ticky tack injuries"
"Anthony Davis cannot be their center. He wouldn’t last 3 weeks, the whole point is to keep him healthy."
This just in - Ben Simmons for Lebron James and Anthony Davis +2 future first round picks and a swap.
"We're in a dimension where Westbrook, LeBron and Anthony Davis will play Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden for an NBA Championship   If you told 2010 Thunder fan me that this would be the situation, I would shit my pants in indecisiveness on who I want to win."
Rockets traded away capella too. They had austin rivers switched out onto anthony davis. That rockets roster was a dumpster fire.
"I guess if u have no ability to understand how basketball works u might just think that. Hashim Thabeet was not mobile or skilled he basically got drafted for being really tall. Mobley is uniquely mobile for his size and has skill to boot. U only think the two could be similar if u have no idea what goes into being an NBA player. No one ver stated thabeet was a unique talent, they have for Mobley. His defensive stats in college closely mirror those of AD and Embiid. He lead a team that he was the only top 100 prospect on to the elite 8 and their best season in years and I promise USC doesn’t run that back next yr. he’s the only fresh to ever win DPOY and player of the year other than u guessed it, Anthony Davis. Don’t deny the obvious. People did that with Luka by not thinking that an 18 yr old winning MVP in the 2nd best league in the world didn’t make him obviously the best available. When obvious talent hits u in the face it’s not stressful like some drafts can be. This draft will be a breeze for anyone picking top 3. Unique prospects back to back to back."
"So Anthony Davis, LeBron, and Westbrook ?  Mate this is championship-potential big three dam"
You aren’t going to just leave Anthony Davis open regardless of that percentage you’re talking about &amp; if you do he’ll hit enough
there is a large difference between Anthony Davis + Russell WB and Jrue + Khris  every team around the league is taking AD + WB and you know it
&gt; and pretty washed as a player.  i swear you guys are on crack. what about russ has gotten worse in the past few years? his weaknesses are the same and he's still dropping triple doubles and raising teams floors.  he is a premier guard in the league however way you spin it. just because he can't shoot doesn't mean he has no value anymore.  pairing him with lebron fucking james and anthony davis is going to result in a pretty damn good team  idk if it's bron fans trying to downplay how good this team is gonna be or what but this is a clear cut superteam core no matter how you spin it
&gt; Westbrook will make Anthony Davis unstoppable  by... stealing his rebounds? or... have you something else in mind?
“Here’s a bunch of pieces that couldn’t even win with Lebron and Anthony Davis”… “Also we traded Westbrook”
Their shooting is literally Anthony Davis
"Ah yes, Lebron, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook. The truest underdog story."
I agree 100%. This is some stupid shit.  You have to believe that Pelinka knows better. It's probably LeBron and AD pushing for this trade since players always misevaluate the talents of other players. No modern GM would actually want this lineup of four mediocre shooters:  &amp;#x200B;  1. Russell Westbrook 2. LeBron James 3. Anthony Davis 4. Random 7-Footer who will play Center when AD is scared.
They’ll get plenty of veterans on minimums. Westbrook will make Anthony Davis unstoppable

"Westbrook to Los Angeles, Anthony Davis to DC.  😉"
Lol wtf is going to come out next? Sixers asked for Anthony Davis &amp; 2 first round picks for Ben Simmons?
"Cavs writers are not the only ones saying that other analysts too. He’s the only fresh in a power conference to win player of the year and defensive player of the year outside of....you guessed it, Anthony Davis. And he defensive metics in college mirror those of AD and Embiid. Anyone with eyes can see bro is the real deal. USC didn’t have one top 100 prospect and was working with mostly small college transfers and he took them to the Elite 8 and one of their best years in history and if u watched it was quite obvious it was because of him they won’t be repeating that success next year trust me."
"Is Morey doing this to show Simmons how highly the team thinks of him and don't want to part with him?  Like, is this a ploy to boost Simmons' confidence in himself because Morey doesn't actually want to trade him?  Next we're going to hear that the Sixers asked for LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and the Lakers to convince NOLA to give back multiple draft picks so they can gift them to the Sixers in exchange for Simmons."
We just going to assume he learns to shoot?  That didn't go so well for Ben Simmons.  Because if he doesn't learn to shoot...  Let's say he actually *is* literally the next Draymond Green.  He still won't be the best player out of this draft.  Because Draymond wasn't even really close - Anthony Davis and Lillard for sure above him.  Beal and Middleton arguably.  And this draft is pretty well stacked at the top.  Now let's say he is more of a poor man's Draymond... I mean he could *easily* end up a decent player but be wildly overdrafted at 5 or 6.
"i mean, ad denied he asked to be traded to the [lakers](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/anthony-davis-denies-he-asked-be-traded-lakers) as well. Stars want to look good, and people who dont understand that are the true clowns"
I don’t see anyone versatile enough on offense and defense that could do that.    Maybe Anthony Davis.
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
"If he signs the 5year extension this summer (he’s a little busy right now in Tokyo) the extension would officially begin in October 2022 and last until June 2027. He would be eligible for ANOTHER 5 year extension in summer 2026. But he could tell the Mavericks he won’t sign the extension in 2026, much the way Anthony Davis told the Pelicans he wouldn’t sign an extension, and they traded AD to the Lakers. The Rose Rule Max extensions are intended to help the teams that drafted players keep them, not lose them to super teams. The best example is Giannis Antetokounmpo, who signed a rookie deal, a rookie extension, and now a 3rd contract with Milwaukee. Dame Lillard in Portland is another example. Giannis has won a Championship, Dame hasn’t. Both are with the teams that drafted them. One reason superstars leave is endorsements, they’re told they can earn more selling shoes/products in Ny&amp;LA, but in Luka’s case, his market is currently Europe, kids in Compton and Harlem aren’t buying his sneakers, but kids all through Europe are. So I don’t think his outside basketball earnings would increase if he leaves Dallas,"
1) Kevin Durant 2) Giannis 3) Lebron James 4) Steph Curry 5) James Harden 6) Luka Doncic 7) Nikola Jokic 8) Damian Lillard 9) Anthony Davis 10) Joel Embiid
Anthony Davis easily
"If by “all get injured” you mean “Anthony Davis get injured,” then yeah it’ll probably happen again."
"The question is... how far into the bench would USA have to go to lose to the world's best?  Team 1 = Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kareem Abdul Jabaar  Team 2 = Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Shaquille O'Neal  Team 3 = Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Wilt Chamberlain  Team 4 = Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Bill Russell  Team 5 = John Stockton, John Havlicek, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Moses Malone  Team 6 = Isaiah Thomas, James Harden, Scottie Pippen, Anthony Davis, David Robinson  Team 7 = Bob Cousy, Allen Iverson, Bob Pettit, Elvin Hayes, George Mikan  Team 8 = Russell Westbrook, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Dominique Wilkins, Bill Walton"
Just popping in to let everyone know Buddy Hield is older than Anthony Davis. Alright carry on with your day.
"I kind of want it to happen in a ""some men just want to watch the world burn"" sort of way.  I genuinely have no idea how this team would work, I don't know what the roles would be or how these players would adapt to them. Aside from ""please, someone, anyone who can shoot"" I can't figure out which ring chasing role players make sense to try to add to glue the whole thing together.  LeBron is a point guard in the body of Karl Malone. Anthony Davis is a shooting guard in the body of Kevin Garnett. Russell Westbrook is a much shorter, much more inefficient Wilt Chamberlain. Is Russ the Center on this team? I'm only half joking when I ask that question.  But it'll certainly be a spectacle, both the product on the court and the endless discussions and arguments and gloating and excuse-making and hot takes it'll generate. So fuck it, roll the ball out, let's see what happens. It'll be super interesting, that's for sure."
The league starts to make a lot more sense when you start to think of players in terms of:  GUARD - primary ball handlers / usually good outside shooters who can penetrate  WING - perimeter players who are good at cutting / shooting / iso plays  BIG - those who would traditionally be referred to as Centers or PFs like Anthony Davis or Tim Duncan  Lonzo came into the league as a Guard but he's developed into a Wing that can play a Guard role in transition.
"Also makes me wonder if part of this is so he can turn around to Ben and Kultch and say, *""No one's biting.  Your value is shit.  You're not Anthony Davis.  You don't get to dictate the terms of when we trade you and where we send you to.""*"
"Nothing stopping them from swapping Ben straight up for a player that’s better offensively now with less potential and just take L if Ben becomes LeBron 2.0 on a different team. But nah, keep asking for trade packages like he’s Anthony Davis or James Harden and we’ll be right back to talking about how “Ben and Joel can totally work on a championship team” in November"
The ol’ Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis 2020 playoffs
"Actually his best years were 2009-2013 before he tore his ACL. He had a numbers year in 2016 with the kings but not John wall numbers and also didn’t go to the playoffs. 2017 he came off the bench for the Bulls that season, started in playoffs and led the to two wins versus Boston but broke his wrist right after. He helped Anthony Davis to his first playoff appearance in 2018 where they swept the Blazers. His 2007-2009 stint was good and he won a chip with the Celtics but he definitely wasnt the main reason why they won. During the 2010s, he was one of, if not, THE most important player on his playoff teams."
"If you don’t know how Anthony Davis would pan out, and your team fit is better with a shooter, He’d go 1."
You'd have to be on crack to select him over Anthony Davis.
Honestly though which team is better?  2020 US Olympics team vs 2020 US players not participating  2020 Team:  Bam Adebayo  Devin Booker  Keldon Johnson  Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine  Damien Lilaird  Javalle McGee  Khris Middleton  Jayson Tatum    NOT PARTICIPATING:  Lebron James  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Steph Curry  Chris Paul  Bradley Beal  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Julius Randle  Russell Westbrook
Anthony Davis - Bubble Boy  Put that man in a bubble for the first and only time in his life and he was healthy and thriving
"2031: ""The New Orleans Pelicans are looking for an Anthony Davis"""
"fwiw, while i'm not criticizing biles personally, mental health issues are absolutely not new in sports, even at high levels  it used to just be called ""choking"" or ""being soft"" and that's always something that people have been criticized for, just like some people criticize athletes who aren't able to stay healthy on a consistent basis (e.g. anthony day-to-davis, it's not like that's a particularly healthy nickname to give somebody lol)"
And it's a lot less than what the Clippers traded for Paul George and what the Lakers traded for Anthony Davis.
Why did Anthony Davis do that?  Same reason. Beal is good friends with Tatum and wants to play out the rest of his prime next to to Tatum and Jaylen in their primes.
"Sure, but it makes no sense that Boston is the only team in the entire league that he would consider. Even Anthony Davis didn’t limit his desired destination to one team."
"They're not giving up Jaylen.  It's very realistic that Beal wants Boston, in which case the Wizards have very little leverage.  He'd be a one year rental anywhere else, which would plummet what any other team would pay for him.  And unlike the Anthony Davis situation where Lebron's candle was burning, the Celtics can very easily wait a year to just sign Beal outright as a free agent after next season.  So the Celtics are only going to give up what they feel Beal is worth for this one upcoming season.  IMO this is more or less precisely where things are at.  Negotiating over the value of Beal for one year."
Yes? You are saying that like it’s impossible lol. Two of his last 3 seasons he’s been at 19-20 PPG with bad shot selection and a high degree of difficulty on a mediocre roster. Imagine him on a team with LeBron James and anthony Davis lmao. He’d get so many open looks
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
I heard someone say Anthony Day to Davis and haven’t stopped thinking about it since.
"Anthony ""Street Clothes"" Davis is a good one too"
Anthony Day-to-Davis
Can you please cite where the article says “ Lakers officials worried LeBron James and Anthony Davis’ window may be shorter than originally anticipated. There is internal urgency driving their movements at the moment.”?
I read this as much as them coming to reality with the fact AD isnt going to be able to take over the torch from LeBron as well as hoped. In other words the Lakers when Anthony Davis is the best player on the team(or at least very close to it) arent going to be as good as they were dreaming of. Wake up call that AD hitting like 53% of his mid range jumpers in the bubble wasnt real long term.
the Warriors Lakers play in game was my favorite. the defense Draymond was playing on Anthony Davis was incredible
"Thank you for fact checking me. And I think hield is much better suited as a starter than he is a 6th man, I don’t think it makes much sense to bring him off the bench. Adding him to a lineup with LeBron and Anthony Davis is going to make the Lakers much more dangerous. We already know what LeBron can do passing the ball. Buddy is going to get much better looks than he would in Sacramento, which should in theory result in more efficient scoring (he’s already an elite 3 point shooter but his numbers could definitely see a jump). An AD/Buddy PnR should scare teams. If teams go over, it gives AD an easy shot at the rim. Under, and Buddy gets a wide open shot. Meanwhile LeBron is still on the court and can get involved at any time. Buddy is the perfect #3 for this Lakers team"
"That team needs to be a top 3 seed for that guy to win MVP. In the East, I think most people agree that unless some serious injuries to occur the Bucks, 76ers or the Nets are going to be the top 3 seeds. The only real wildcard is the 76ers with Ben Simmons trade possibilities and Joel Embiid injury history. So, there’s one potential spot open, and the most likely team is the Hawks sneaking in. So, Trae Young can be that dark horse MVP in the East.  In the West it’s more interesting and the most likely dark horse MVP is coming from there. I think there are a couple of candidates like Devin Booker who could get a lot of serious consideration if the Suns finish as the Nr. 1 team; Paul George if the Clippers end as a top 3 seed without Kawhi.  And there are the “Are they really a dark horse if everyone knows them?” In Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard. I think if the Lakers finish as a top 3 seed and we see Anthony Davis putting monster numbers without LeBron and carrying the team you could see a lot of buzz for MVP. Damian Lillard if he stays with the Blazers and they are a top 3 seed you could see a lot narrative in his favour for staying with the Blazers, being loyal and deserving MVP for guiding his team from the 6th seed to the 3rd seed in the Wild Wild West."
"Well, I saw so many wide open shots for the Clippers in their matchup. Idk if that's just bad guard play from Utah or if Gobert is actually a big negative there. Either way their defense was so bad in the playoffs, I think they had like a 124 drtg or something. And also why am I getting downvoted for saying that Anthony Davis doesn't get targetted in the PNR?"
"Why is there a need for that restriction? Lol. You can’t take it that the USA is just better overall. Plus, who could go against this kind of lineup:  PG: Trae Young, Jalen Suggs SG: Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown SF: Jayson Tatum, Mikal Bridges, Trey Murphy PF: Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis C: Evan Mobley, Myles Turner   Show me an all Euro lineup under 30 that’s better than all those all stars lol"
"In 9 NBA seasons, Anthony Davis has played 72+ games (or the equivalent for the last two seasons) twice in his entire career. I don’t think “he’s quite likely to play 72+ games” is a true statement."
Anthony Davis
"# Team USA  * STARTERS:     * Curry, Harden, LeBron, Durant &amp; Anthony Davis * BENCH:    * Kyrie, Lilliard, Tatum, Paul George, Devin Booker, Beal &amp; Zion  # Team Euro  * STARTERS:    * Luka Dončić, Bojan Bogdanović, Giannis, Jokić &amp; Gobert    * BENCH:    * Domantas Sabonis, Clint Capela, Evan Fournier, Dennis Schröder, Bogdan Bogdanović &amp; Rubio"
Anthony Davis would be a better defensive center than anyone on the European team except for Gobert.   Team Europe is horrendous at the guard position compared to team USA.
"Giannis has missed critical playoff games due to injury.  So did KD, so did Harden, so did Anthony Davis, so did Chris Paul.  Simone Biles missed a critical event because her injury is something that other people can't perceive, and she's being criticized because people think that fixing mental health is as easy as doing a fuckin mindfulness meditation  if she stayed in due to some sort of psychopathic pride, she could have severely injured herself and sunk Team USA's chances at medaling."
Anthony Davis?
"Curry, Lebron, Durant, Kawhi, Harden, Anthony Davis.  The Euroteam has decline after the 3 you listed"
Double check those years you think they had cap space and double check those rosters for a prime Anthony Davis while you’re at it
"That's true. Curry, DeRozan, Lillard will probably get there. Anthony Davis is ahead of Andrew by a decent amount, as is Kyrie Irving. Giannis is well on his way as well. Booker and Towns may pass Wiggins as he's climbing."
"Players do it all the time  Joel Embiid- ""The Process""  Anthony Davis- ""Fear the Brow""  Jeremy Lin- ""Linsanity""  Kevin Durant- ""Durantula""  Pat Riley- ""Threepeat""  Shits definitely got a corny feel to it. But it makes total sense. And even if they don't feel like directly making money from it themselves they can license out the term for others to use in merchandise sales."
"But I’m even just talking defense too.  What are you supposed to do against Allen in the paint, and Nance+Mobley stretching the floor and being big?  Nance gets some of the highest deflections in the nba, he affects passing lanes.  Mobley will get tons of blocks and be fast enough to stretch the floor defensively too.  It’s like we’re in a situation where we have a weaker draymond at the 3 and a weaker Anthony Davis at the 4."
Ok do you want the generational PF/C who can still stretch the floor and be like Anthony Davis or do you want like… nothing?  You can draft Mobley or you can draft really badly and get someone who could potentially maybe someday guard two generational centers and Deandre Ayton??
make it a 3 way with evan fournier  celtics get: schroeder on 20 million  lakers get: fournier  knicks get: lebron james and anthony davis
"&gt;If you had not made that trade and those guys had all left it would have opened up $38 million in cap space that summer.  And exactly who were the Grizzlies going to sign in the 2020 offseason with this mythical cap space? Anthony Davis was sticking with the Lakers. Ingram was a restricted free agent and sticking with the Pelicans. FVV was sticking with the Raptors. Gordon Hayward?   There simply wasn't anybody who the Grizzlies were going to sign that we could have signed that would have actually fit our timeline or our team.   We thought Winslow was going to be a productive player and a building block for the team. The Grizzlies are one of the last FA destinations in the league. They took a gamble on a player and it didn't work out. But acting like they were going to sign a superstar with this mythical cap space is absurd. There was nobody on the market who played the position of need and was on the same timeline of Ja and JJJ.   &gt;And let's be honest: the only reason Memphis did this is because they were too proud to just buy Iguodala out, even though they'd already received a 1st round pick to take him on.   And there's why you actually think it was a disaster. You're riding the ""Free Iggy"" train. The front office didn't say shit about Iggy. Act like they made a stink when you didn't hear shit from the GM. Sure, Ja and Brooks said something, but nothing from the actual team."
Are you unironically calling out Anthony Davis for doing the same thing the star of your team did a year before? That's some funny shit
"You are acting like he’s a free agent, he’s under contract  He can’t just get up and leave, or hold his team hostage like bitch ass Anthony Davis"
Just like they were with Anthony Davis. And James Harden.
Anthony Davis was a fucking monster that playoff run. Completely changed games with his defense alone. Then you have morons on this sub “he’s not a real superstar”
Bruh Anthony Davis Is not top 5 lmao
&gt; Spurs probably could’ve gotten almost the Anthony Davis trade package from the Lakers and they’d be in a better place right now  The spurs asked for a package slightly worse than the AD trade and then it leaked that the lakers thought the spurs weren't serious about trading with them and almost every NBA fan thought the spurs ask was ridiculous.
&gt;  Spurs probably could’ve gotten almost the Anthony Davis trade package from the Lakers  Bullshit. Nothing even close to that was on the table.
&gt;Spurs probably could’ve gotten almost the Anthony Davis trade package from the Lakers  You gotta be kidding me. There was no question mark around AD’s ability (or willingness) to play like it was with Kawhi.
"They still won the trade big time. Those are pretty good assets for the Spurs but in retrospect it’s even more lopsided. Even on an expiring deal players like Anthony Davis, Paul George, Harden, and then Jrue all have set the bar ready high for trading a bonafide superstar, and its a pretty easy argument that Kawhi is superior to all the players I just listed. You can only really name 2-4 players max that are “better” than Kawhi. Spurs probably could’ve gotten almost the Anthony Davis trade package from the Lakers and they’d be in a better place right now  Edit: (wasn’t saying that jrue is a bonafide superstar, just that he commanded a superstar price)"
Anthony Davis doesn't strike me as someone whod be satisfied with just a single ring and than a pay day but what do I know I've never met the guy
"Was it really a need for y'all to get someone who takes unnecessary many posessions away from LeBron James and Anthony Davis? Westbrook has close to zero off ball impact, while Hield's three-point shooting spaces out the floor."
It’s almost like you get a discount for having LeBron James and Anthony Davis on your team as a title contender or something.
You know Anthony Davis played for Kentucky and now he’s on the Lakers
"And people that don't rate Anthony Davis as a top tier superstar. He legitimately destroyed every single one of those teams on both ends and has always been a playoff performers, with or without LeBron. People gotta respect his game."
"&gt;We also have AD basically demanding a trade to us.  Stop repeating this inaccurate nonsense.  &gt;""All 29 other teams are on my list,"" Davis later said on NBATV. ""I don't have a preferred destination. I just want to win. Big market, small market, I don't care. I want to win.""   &gt;   &gt;[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots)  Davis is a Laker because no one else could match the ridiculous trade the Lakers made to rent him for one season -- which was the most expensive rental in NBA, and I think North American, history."
"I mean you really didn't address my other points.   Who are these switchable perimeter defending centers? Bam? Anthony Davis? And? KG could do it back then as well, Duncan was decent at it if needed to be done and was a defensive anchor well into the mid 2010's.  Iverson didn't just rely on speed, he had amazing handles and again with the league no longer calling carries that would greatly help him. With the league often calling fouls in favour of guards that drive and get touched, that would greatly help AI.   There's far more pros than cons. Guards in today's league get to the rim at will, I don't see how you're arguing a guard like AI would somehow struggle."
"The Bucks won, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a problem. We’re not far removed from:  - Kawhi leaving a championship team to go to LA - Kevin Durant leaving a finals team to go NYC - LeBron James leaving a finals team to go to LA  - Kyrie Irving leaving a top seeded team to go NYC - Paul George leaving a playoff team to go to LA  - James Harden leaving a playoff team to go to NYC - Anthony Davis tanking a season and  forcing his way off a team with Randle and Holiday to go to LA   Sure everyone had their own unique reason, but you have to admit there’s a pattern"
"&gt; We saw Kuzma, Lonzo, and Ingram all have their best years when they weren’t on the same team as Lebron.   Kuzma absolutely had his best year with LeBron, in his second season (the first one LeBron was there). Kuzma hasn't been as good in the two years since because Anthony Davis took most of his minutes. As for Lonzo and Ingram, they barely ever played with LeBron, as Lonzo played a grand total of 34 games with LeBron and Ingram only played 35 games with him.   You also need to remember that both Ingram and Lonzo were 21 when the Lakers traded them, so it's not at all surprising that they've both improved from the players they were at only 21 years of age. After all, both Lonzo and Ingram played better with LeBron than they did before he joined the Lakers, because no shit, they were only 20 years old before LeBron joined them."
"They traded Vlade Divac away (incidentally, for Kobe) to clear cap space, as well as George Lynch and Anthony Peeler. They then refused to sign Dale Davis, Dikembe Mutombo, Dennis Rodman, and Ervin Johnson because they were holding out everything for Shaq. They basically gave up any teambuilding they were doing that offseason in order to make sure they had enough money to guarantee they would get Shaq."
"I mean not when the asking price is Kd, James Harden, and 2 protected firsts.     Here is Anthony Davis, we got no draft picks.... you want Russ or Lebron?"
"The more minutes that Anthony Davis and LeBron play, the fewer opportunities there are to stagger them. When LeBron and Anthony Davis are playing 36-40 minutes a game in a playoff series, either Westbrook has to play with them or have a significantly reduced role. If it's the latter case, it reduces his value to the team a lot."
If it was 2016 I’d say Anthony Davis. However currently it’s gotta be Steph. Man can just do shit that makes you go “ damn he just hit that”. The fact that 3s are like a regular field goal to him. Open 3= free throw.
You can't bet $80M on Anthony Davis not getting injured.
"""I call him Anthony 'Street Clothes' Davis because he's always in street clothes."
how do the lakers trade for Anthony Davis and Westbrook in the span of two years and still somehow have assets?
"The Lakers won a championship 10 months ago. Vogel's not getting fired unless the Lakers lose 10 straight games by 40+ points, which isn't gonna happen because despite what everyone thinks about the Lakers, they still have Lebron James and Anthony Davis on the team who will once again be healthy and dominant. The Lakers only fell apart due to injury this season, and very likely would have repeated if they could have sorted themselves out but obviously they didn't. I know there's more clicks in predicting doom and gloom or trying to put Vogel in the hot seat before we've even had a training camp or even played a single game, but you're wrong."
"""Medical staff discover Anthony Davis' skeleton is literally made of glass. Davis will undergo season ending surgery to integrate natural human bone into his body."""
"I am very high on RJ Barrett he gets compared alot to Morant and Zion being in the same draft class with those two having an immediate impact but I truly believe RJ will be an All Star in this league. He has 2 way potential and has already increased his 3pt shooting from his rookie year of 32% to 40% last year.  I am low on Anthony Davis. He is extremely talented but I  always felt like he should of been able to carry a team through the playoffs similiar to what we have seen Jokic and Embiid have done being the ""guy"". People view him as a 1b to Lebron but I think he is more of a Number 2"
Im going to go with Westbrook or davis. Something about being the 3rd option in lebron system doesn't work. Also cole Anthony
That’s what I was thinking: this could be a Anthony Davis situation
"Aside from all the ones mentioned 2009 doesn't look too bad. Sure you get Thabeet but you get Blake Griffin and James Harden as well.  Or 2012 Anthony Davis, MKG and Brad Beal."
Tobey is just a rich mans Anthony Davis!

"The argument was Bron didn’t have help like Kobe or Jordan. He needed to find his Pippen, his Gasol or his Khris Middleton. But he went FAR BEYOND that. He went for Wade, Anthony Davis and Kyrie plus other players. I’m not continuing this convo. We get it. You love LeBron and you want to have his children."
Yea…with super teams. Jordan and Kobe would’ve won with Anthony Davis too. Let me know when Bron wins with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton as his teammates and he has to drop 50 in Game 7.
The scream remind me of Anthony Davis when he was getting spanked lol
Anthony Davis gonna join the list
Where was Lebron with out Dwade and Bosh? Kyrie and Kevin Love? Anthony Davis? And now Russ and Melo?
I’m expecting Anthony Davis to have his best year as a Pro with Westbrook giving him easier looks with his passing. MVP caliber season for Davis.
also anthony davis. If AD was here this is likely a wrap. Nobody in the international game can deal with him.

Anthony Davis about to average a career high
"Wade was stuck getting bounced in the 1st round or missing the playoffs every year after Shaq fell off and got traded to Phoenix while Chris Bosh couldn’t make the playoffs at all in Toronto, let alone win in the playoffs.   Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love couldn’t crack 35 wins on their respective teams before LeBron, let alone make the playoffs, let alone win in the playoffs.  Anthony Davis couldn’t make the playoffs in New Orleans, let alone win in the playoffs.  LeBron turned every one of them into champions within the 1st 2 seasons lmao. Chris Bosh missed the entire 2012 2nd round series against Indiana, missed 4 of the 7 games against Boston in the ECF, and was limited to 12 and 7 in only 25 mpg in the 3 games he did play in that series after returning from injury. They still won the East and ultimately the championship because LeBron was the best player in the league by far.  In 2013 Wade was having obvious knee issues through the whole playoff run. He averaged less than 14 points on below 37% shooting in round 1 vs Milwaukee, averaged less than 13 points in round 2 against the Bulls, and averaged less than 16 ppg on below 44% shooting in the ECF vs. Indy. Bosh averaged 11 points and 4 rebounds on less than 38% shooting in that same ECF vs Indy. They still won the East and ultimately the championship against one of the best teams of all time in the Spurs because LeBron was the best player in the league by far. They won the finals against the Spurs in the minutes that Wade was on the bench in favor of Ray Allen.   But yes, LeBron was one “cockriding” them and not the other way around. Can’t make this shit up lol. I didn’t even get into the part where Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder in round 1 of the 2015 playoffs and they still rampaged to the finals without him only for Kyrie to get hurt in game 1 of the finals so LeBron could push one of the greatest teams of all time in Golden State to 6 games with a starting 5 of Delly/Shump/Bron/TT/Mosgov because he was the best player in the league by far.   Also didn’t yet mention the 2016 playoffs when Love averaged 8 points on 35% shooting against the 73 win Warriors who were an awful matchup for him but the Cavs still came back down 3-1 with LeBron putting in arguably the greatest finals performance of all time because he was the best player in the league by far.  While we’re at it let’s fast forward to 2018 after Kyrie was PMSing and forced a trade in which the Cavs got back a pile of garbage and still went on to win the East and make the finals with Jeff Green being their 2nd best player in the playoffs ahead of “superstar” Kevin Love. That same team went on to win 19 fucking games the next season when Bron went to LAL.  Sounds like Bron was really cockriding them hard though lmao.   Meanwhile when MJ retired to play baseball the Bulls still won 55 games, pushed the Knicks 7 games in the 2nd round, and got screwed out an ECF appearance at least by the referees. Anchored by arguably the best coach of all time, MJ had a supporting cast that was still a contender without him. When Lebron left Cleveland for Miami, they won 19 fucking games after winning 61 with the same team the year before plus LeBron. But MJ is WARRIOR for being drafted to an organization that put him in an incredible situation  unlike the COWARD LeBron who only carried Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams to the finals once before leaving after wasting 7 years. Lmaoooo.  Kobe got drafted to play in LA with one of the 3 most dominant players in the modern era while also getting to play for one of the best coaches of all time. Kobe averaged 15 points on 35% shooting in the finals against Indiana and they still won easily because Shaq averaged literally close to 40 points on  almost 60% shooting lmao. THAT is cockriding like a playboy bunny. But once again, What an absolute GAMER  for not leaving the absolutely perfect situation that was brought to him unlike the FRAUD LeBron James who went running from Drew Gooden and Larry Hughes after 7 years. Also Kobe totally didn’t publicly request a trade after they had a couple bad years after Shaq left before they got Pau Gasol and reloaded. That definitely didn’t happen and Kobe would’ve stuck it out for way more than 7 years in Cleveland with Boobie Gibson and Jamario Moon because he was a true junkyard DOG unlike LEBUM.  The LeBron hating cult has gone way past the point of insufferable. Y’all have been bitching about a dude leaving the most incompetent franchise in sports (while Boston was in the conference coming off a finals appearance with 4 stars on one team, mind you) for literally over a decade now. Get over it."
"Don’t have time to debate? You literllay spent like the last hour debating me and then deleted all your comments, then came back to debate more. There’s no way you’re in law school and not even high school is believeable.    I’ll give you that I was wrong about jokics raptor but it’s still a flawed stat.

"3 or 1   Would replace Marques Johnson with Iso Joe and take 5 tho.    Some others to add   Curry family   Tim Hardaway, THJ, Anfernee Hardaway  George Hill, Grant Hill, Solomon Hill   Anthony Davis, Baron Davis, Terence Davis   Ben Gordon, Aaron Gordon, Eric Gordon"
"I mean, there was a discussion to be had between he and Anthony Davis. Even so, AD only won more than 35 games twice in his tenure with the Pelicans so that stipulation is kinda silly. Sacramento was an absolute dumpster fire throughout his time with them, but that doesn't detract from Boogies skill."
I remember the post like this from last year asking if Pelinka was a better GM than Ainge because he managed to get Anthony Davis. Love posts like these. They crack me up.
"I remember Raps fans clowning Kings fans for saying Davis’ defense was good. Like oh man, you guys have no idea how down bad we are. Davis was guarding Anthony Davis in a game we won at Staples Center lmfao"
Let's recap exactly who they went through. A discombobulated Lakers team that rushed LeBron back from a high ankle sprain and then lost Anthony Davis in the series who was playing injured anyway before he couldn't play anymore. They beat a nuggets team missing their star point guard and they were starting Austin Rivers. Then they beat a clippers team who was without their best player and one of the best players in the league.  They jumped a bucks team in the finals whose star was still coming back from knee injury didn't look perfect in game one so they won that one then they shot lights out game two and one that one and then looked over matched in the next four games.

"Bro, you're talking about these guys being injured recently. Anthony Davis has never played a full season. I get it, the dude is extremely talented and he has size, but he shoots the Lakers out of a lot of games. He's had his clutch performances, but I've also seen him shoot them out of a lot of games.   He's only getting older and with the injury history he has, I don't see it getting better.   I'm not a Laker hater, I'm just calling it how I see it."
"""what happened""  Anthony Davis got injured. That's what happened."
Anthony Davis / Baron Davis / Glen Davis
"But Kyrie isn't a game-wrecker like AD is. Kyrie can get as hot as anyone and drop 40, but he will always be limited on defense and you can scheme to make it harder for him to score. You can make him work hard for his points. There isn't anyone on the Nets (or the league, really) who can do anything to stop Anthony Davis. I feel like because of the injuries last year people forget what a nightmare this guy is to scheme against. He's the strongest guy on the court, can stretch the floor, kill you in the post, and is an all-nba defensive player on top of it"
And now he is going to be with Lebron James and Anthony Davis...
"This would've been a superteam 5 or 6 years ago. Now, it's just a bunch of dudes hanging on to a career and playing anywhere.   Anthony ""Hospital"" Davis won't play more than half the year"
If there was ever a year for Anthony Davis to win DPOY…
"&gt;It's a little disingenuous to gloss over all of the players who have specifically forced their way off of other teams and on to the Lakers  You call that disingenuous?  Abdul-Jabbar asked Milwaukee to trade him to New York or California.  None of those teams could match the Lakers' offer of four starters -- two of whom wound up being among the 8 other players who've had their Jersey retired in Milwaukee.  At the time, almost everyone assumed he would go home to New York, but the Knicks didn't want him badly enough.  Davis had 29 teams on his preferred destination list.    &gt;""All 29 other teams are on my list,"" Davis later said on NBATV. ""I don't have a preferred destination. I just want to win. Big market, small market, I don't care. I want to win.""   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821089-anthony-davis-i-never-said-celtics-werent-on-list-of-preferred-trade-spots  Again, no one could match the Lakers' ridiculous offer for him.  The Howard and Paul trades were both disastrous, so you might should reconsider including those in your exceedingly disingenuous list."
"People are really forgetting how dominant Anthony Davis is when he's healthy. If everyone in that series is healthy, I think it's much closer to a coin flip. It's 3 superstars VS 3 superstars with the supporting cast favoring LA, and I'd argue that Anthony Davis is the biggest game changer out of any of the 6 currently because he can absolutely wreck games on both ends of the floor."
"Pelicans fans are whiny as fuck lmao. Zion Williamson was one of the most hyped prospects ever and New Orleans was in the midst of a debacle with Anthony Davis just two years ago. They have yet to make the playoffs with him on the team, unlike other teams with their young stars (Young, Doncic). There are already rumblings of Williamson and his family wanting out of New Orleans, so no shit there is gonna be a ton of pressure on the franchise.  SGA isn’t remotely close to as good as Williamson and OKC (and Minnesota) is somehow even less relevant than New Orleans."
"Are we sure multiple teams wanted Ball, though? The Ball buzz at the trade deadline was only about the Bulls, and clearly the Bulls were the only ones making a big offer now in free agency. (Pretty clear inference from the deal being done in the first minute of free agency; and probably also why the Pels got so little in the S&amp;T. If other teams were competing for Ball, the Bulls probably have to give up more for him.)  And can I point out that every other move by the Bulls was a grotesque overpay for a mediocre one-dimensional player? They're building around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan as well as Ball - and gave up the farm to do so. There is very little evidence the current Bulls front office knows what they're doing.  Re: the Anthony Davis heist, the Pels still have an age-22 All-Star in Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Didi Louzada, two R1 picks, and two R1 pick swaps from that. They're doing OK there."
Anthony Davis
Counterpoint: LeBron James and Anthony Davis
"Can you detail for me exactly Vogel’s system is the cause for Caruso’s defense? You cite playing with another chase defender, but how is that specifically accounting for most of Caruso’s effective defense?   Caruso is really good at getting over screens which can slow down or blow up a lot of pick and roll actions or off ball sets for shooters. We saw in the Suns series how often their guards would need to re-screen when getting into their actions and he was still never out of the play. How is Vogel doing that for Caruso? What is it about the scheme that allows Caruso to go over a screen and still stay in front of his man?   He’s also a bigger guard so he had more size to use against other bigger guards like Booker. He was good in other areas off the ball like helping in from the nail. None of that is coming from playing in Vogel’s system.   This isn’t a Jazz situation where everyone is asking one player to do everything. With the Jazz you can tell more that their perimeter defenders aren’t that good because they’re asked to do less and get beat on the perimeter. It’s also not the opposite situation where a coach is using a scheme to hide a bad defender. You can see stuff like that with teams like the Hornets employing more junk defenses.   There’s no doubt NBA defense is still mostly about wings and especially bigs Caruso wasn’t as key to the defense as Anthony Davis. But Caruso is good as an individual in ways which aren’t the result of just having a great big. I think you’ve got this backwards as far as coaching. You can see Vogel’s skills as a defensive coach in how many different defenses this team can play effectively, sure. But he’s largely not turning okay defenders into great ones, as much as anything he’s benefitting from having a team of really good defenders. He isn’t making them something they’re not, he’s utilizing what they can do."
"Well this time he has Anthony Davis with him too, so they should be fine"
Don’t worry. They’ll get the next generational prospect to fuck up. We have to have the Chris Paul -&gt; Anthony Davis -&gt; Zion continuity
"Anthony ""I don't want to play at C"" Davis  Retiring Gasol  Old man Dwight  That ain't much. And they literally picked ageing Dwight over Drummond."
anthony davis
"There’s zero guarantee all the lakers pick will be bad. They have the lakers pick in 2,3, and 4 years from now. Unlikely lebron is a factor for all of those years, so all it would take is one Anthony Davis injury for one of those picks to be a high lottery pick. Also if the lakers can’t find a new star to put next to Davis lakers might not be a playoff team, he could barely make the playoffs for years with the pelicans with ok talent around him."
I think Anthony Davis is pretty deece on that end of the floor
If he's indeed an average guard defender then in Vogel's schemes with Anthony fucking Davis behind him he's definitely the fifth starter.
"I got nothing against AD and he's a top 5 defender but given his penchant for being Anthony Day-To-Davis, I as the Lakers FO would probably not have surrounded him with this many defensive liabilities lol. They should've at least kept Caruso, which would've spared them from having to find both minutes and places to hide on defense for both Nunn and Monk, not to mention Melo."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."
"&gt;That expansion team had Oscar Robinson a top twenty player ever.  Yeah, and he was many years past his prime.  And they had almost nothing else.  &gt;I will have to take your word for it was not there in 71, there are not many better defenders the Dwight Howard so who are you thinking there?  Chamberlain, Walton, Thurmond, Lanier, Malone, Gilmore... 20 years of guys tried.  The problem for Howard would be that he's just too small.  Prime Abdul-Jabbar is a match for him athletically, and around 4 or 5 inches taller, with longer arms.  &gt;I mean Gasol can hit threes so might not be the best option  Now, yeah, but he barely even attempted one until he was 32.  And that version is getting absolutely torched on the defensive end.  If I'm coaching in this game, I do not care in the slightest if Gasol makes 1.5 threes -- his career high -- because McAdoo is scoring 40 on him, or Abdul-Jabbar is hanging 50.  &gt;This ignores the AD of it all as well, which is another all time great defender to throw at them.  You could get Davis to cover McAdoo, and he's well-suited to that... but good luck trying to get Davis to guard Abdul-Jabbar.  He's too small, and worse, refuses to play that position.  &gt;Prime Lebron is 2013 and Cooper is 4 inches and 100 pounds away there’s nothing he can do there.  James did not weigh 270 pounds in 2013.  And what Cooper would do is stay in James' jersey on the perimeter -- like he used to do with Bird, driving him to distraction -- and weight doesn't matter there.  So James would have to post him up, but then he'd have to deal with getting his shots over or around a free-lancing Abdul-Jabbar, which is next to impossible.  Abdul-Jabbar held entire playoff teams to 40% shooting in his prime.  &gt;Norm Nixon and Byron Scott can’t stay in front of Russ they just can’t,  Sure they could, they'd give him 6 feet of space, and let him shoot jumpers if he wants.  &gt; Magic won’t be able to guard Anthony in the slightest.  Johnson led the league in steals, twice, and his defense is wildly underrated.  He's also one of the smartest basketball players ever, so he'd just slack off Anthony and invite him to launch from distance... at his career 48% effective rate or even his peak 51%.  For that matter, depending on the ruleset used, I would be inclined just to zone up your team of James, Westbrook, Anthony, Davis and Howard or Gasol.  I'm begging that team to shoot from outside, because they are all poor shooters except James, and even his career number is mediocre.  &gt;Shaq and Karl Malone are the match of McADoo and Kareem, Gary Payton can guard Magic and Cooper couldn’t do much agonist Kobe  Cooper is about as well-equipped as any human to guard Bryant.  No, he couldn't stop him from shooting, no one ever could, including O'Neal.  But he'd force him to take hard shots, which is exactly what you want to do with Bryant, because he'll take them all game long, and miss most of them.  Payton tried to guard a healthy Johnson a couple times -- and got torched for 33 points each time, with 9 and 11 assists.  Johnson shot 12 for 14, and 11 for 14 against him in those games."
This just feels like Anthony Davis + West Coast Nets (Circa '13)
"I’d say lakers are banking on Vogel being able to create a defensive scheme strong enough to be able to lose KCP and Caruso and still be a high level defence.   I don’t really blame them either, the offensive firepower that Russ, Nunn, Monk and Melo provide will more than make up for Vogels offensive coaching deficiencies. It’s also really easy to forget that this team still has Anthony fuckin Davis anchoring the paint."
"It’s crazy how many people truly just want to play with Bron. It can be tough as a superstar (as Russ will soon see) to get even close to your normal #’s unless your name is Anthony Davis. But, as a role player/borderline good player, playing with Bron can take you to the next level."
"Oh wait you mean this: https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2818278-pelicans-anthony-davis-fined-50k-for-agent-rich-paul-publicly-requesting-trade.amp.html  Because Davis definitely requested the trade publicly first and got fined for it. Keep it coming though this is entertaining? Are you a writer, your so good at making stuff up you must be.  Also they benched him so he wouldn't get hurt and kill his trade value. You really have no idea what your talking about."
Link some articles? Because I don't think the Pels did anything but get Anthony Davis exactly where he wanted to go.
Literally Anthony Davis 2 years ago. Your front office tries to disavow dirty in the media. Sorry it took me so long two come up with some literally just two years ago.   Your franchise and front office is trash. Just own it. At least knicks fans do
"Sports training and recovery is different in this era and they can extend their careers a bit farther.  But on top of that, Russ is 32yo and GP was 35yo when he joined the Lakers.  Malone was a 40yo starter in a much more physically demanding and tougher era and his backup was 42yo Horace Grant.   Carmelo will be a 37yo floor spacer off the bench behind Anthony Davis in his prime.   Marc Gasol is 36yo and Dwight Howard is 35yo.  It would be more comparable if that GP+Karl Malone team had been a thing when they still had a last leg of their athleticism left."
"Don’t bother. Pelican fans are the absolute worst. They brigade they hell of out these post and downvote in mass anyone who criticizes their awful treatment of players or pretend like “it’s unprofessional for a player to expose our gm for being a snake”.   They tried to trash and gaslight Anthony Davis when he wanted out. They lied to a well liked and respected veteran. They have made countless boneheaded signings and trades. Yet their fan base does the “wah no one wants us because we are a small market”. Nah you guys just have a garbage reputation now for treating players badly and it’s why young talent wants to book it out of there the first chance they get. When guys would rather play for 10 million less than go to you  it’s not a market issue, it’s a team issue.    Oh also fun fact: Zion shares the same agent as JJ. Probably not a good idea to piss off the agent of your franchise player."
"how often does anthony ""street clothes"" davis get hurt?"
"Normally vet min players are there to fill out a roster. I see this as the lineup they go with:  C Davis  F James  F Ariza  G THT  G Westbrook  B Monk  B Anthony  B Nunn  B Gasol  And then you have Ellington, Howard and Bazemore still. This is a pretty deep roster"
"If r/nba was biased against the Lakers, this take here would single handedly balance it out.  You've listed a bunch of accomplishments without any context. Gasol, Howard and Anthony are all washed up at this point. Lebron's obviously held up a lot better, but he's slowed down some. Westbrook is only even here because he's on the wrong side of his prime and plays a style that at some point isn't going to age well.  So the one star on ""the most stacked team ever put on paper"" is Anthony ""Mr. Glass"" Davis. And he's probably going to have to play center and bang for the entire season, because if he doesn't, that's a lot more minutes for Gasol/Howard.  When Big 3s like the Celtics and Heat won titles, they had younger players, not senior citizens, filling roles. The ring chasers sat on the end of the bench; how's that going to work here?"
This is when they were actually playing together.  16 in total.

You think LeBron James Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook are not a superteam lmfaoooooooooooooo
"Caruso got left than the MLE. The Lakers wouldn’t even match the offer let alone give him more than that. Lol that’s disloyalty at its best.   You dumped Kuzma for Russell Westbrook. Kuzma would’ve gotten that contract on any other team that drafted him, it wasn’t a “fat” contract. You keep calling these mediocre contracts “fat”. You do NEED Westbrook. You just lost the first round and panicked. That’s why your roster is completely overhauled right now. Your team from this year and last year are completely different than the championship team.   Thanks for the long winded way of telling me what I already said. The Lakers dumped all their young players for Anthony Davis. BI and Lonzo only got paid as much as they did because of the strides they made with NOLA. Their reputations weren’t high when they left LA.   “You find me another team who wouldn’t make that trade” Find me another team that doesn’t trade IT for Kyrie Irving. You see? You’re proving my point for me.   IT didn’t get paid before or after his injury because he wasn’t good enough to get paid that much. Either way he wasn’t getting paid.   Why didn’t the Lakers re-sign him after they traded for him the season after? Because he wasn’t the same player.   You just asked me sarcastically if the Lakers were supposed to over pay Alex Caruso because you had his bird rights, but now you’re implying the Celtics should’ve given an undersized injured point guard a max contract instead of trading for Kyrie? Lol   AD’s father wasn’t right. If anything he exposed he’s a hypocrite. The Lakers dumped all their players for his son because he colluded with LeBron and his agency the year before and quit on his team. But yeah the Celtics are disloyal. It has nothing to do with just wanting to play with LeBron and be in LA. Definitely. Haha"
"middleton and holliday are good players and middleton balled out during the postseason but the bucks only have one all star from last season on their roster. Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Lebron with a bunch of good role players is one along with the nets"
Anthony Davis never had a situation where he was disgruntled and refused to play for the team. Trading anthony davis was a matual thing. There was no leverage used. AD wanted out of New Orleans and New Orleans was ready to move on. So idk what you talkin bout dude maybe read the comments before you and understand the convo that is actually happening
…:Anthony Davis literally just did it a year ago. Harden is highly likely to win one next year also after just having done it.   The hell are you talking about. Players have all the leverage in the NBA.
Anthony Davis
"Idk, I'm pretty convinced that Jeremiah Robinson-Earl will be the next Anthony Davis"
"This might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read.  You’re right, all these other guys in recent memory have done it without superstar teams. OH WAIT  Magic had Kareem, MJ had Scottie, Bron had Wade/Bosh/Anthony Davis/Kyrie/Love, Steph had KD/Klay/Draymond, KG had Pierce/Allen, etc, etc.   Having a superstar teammate with you while you win isnt as negative as you’re trying to make it seem."
Are you sure? He did just play with Lebron last season and a pretty good big in Anthony Davis. I don’t disagree that he can be a good player for the team if he humbles  himself and accepts the 6th man role
decent creator? The man who can't run a simple p and r with Anthony ducking davis? lmaoooo
"I don’t feel bad for Schroder one bit.   This dude currently has a chance to play alongside FIVE bonafide hall of famers in route to the Conference Finals at the very least.   But the Lakers FO can only offer him (GASP!) 5.9 million! Oh, the indignity of it all /s.  Schroeder was offered a more than fair contract to be in the STARTING LINEUP with LeBron James and Anthony Davis last year… and yet he’s still demanding MORE money after scoring ZERO points in a must win postseason game!?   GTFOH."
He’s the mexican version of Anthony Davis
"A team that despite being fucked over by injuries, suspensions and somewhat suspect ref’ing in the finals, was 2 possessions away from repeating and capping off the greatest season ever. And then they added Kevin Durant. You would’ve needed to add Kawhi Leonard or Anthony Davis to that Cavs team to balance out the rosters"
"Probably ""Basketball Reasons"". I know it eventually led to Anthony Davis unintentionally which unintentionally led to Zion and the current state of the team. But I just wonder how different the league looks if Stern looks the other owners in the eyes and says ""I said Demps would be able to call the shots. It would be a conflict of interest."""
"Did Anthony Davis join the Lakers the ""right way""? That whole saga is a big recent reason why people may hate the Lakers."
"well it's going to be a new list of 75, rather than adding 25 to the 50 list. But even so, I took a stab at it. Top 25 of last 25 years.    16 Locks (not in order): LeBron, Kobe, Duncan, Garnett, Durant, Nowitzki, CP3, Wade, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Kidd, Nash, Dwight Howard, Iverson and Giannis     7 in the next tier (not in order): Gary Payton, Ben Wallace, Dikembe Mutombo, Anthony Davis, Carmelo Anthony, Paul Pierce and Tony Parker  That means 2 spots left out of: Tracy McGrady, Draymond Green, Paul George, Ray Allen and Grant Hill. I would personally lean towards McGrady and Allen."
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"In hindsight, sure we would have wanted a less disasppointing return. But it was a risk that we thought would work. We didn't mortgage our future in trying to see what Winslow had.   Some people might say we wasted cap space, but there was no free agent coming our way anyways. Anthony Davis was clearly returning to LA. Ingram was a RFA and was returning NO. Gordon Hayward doesn't fit the Ja/JJJ timeline. So, while yes, it was a disappointing return, we didn't really give much of anything up to see if Winslow fit the team."
Size. We need to be able to swarm the paint against Anthony Davis and Giannis of the league. Ayton can't do it alone.
"Abolish the max contract to make it harder for superstars to team up. Bron gets 70% of the lakers cap and has a team of good role players. Same for Durant. Then another 4 teams get to pay Anthony Davis, Harden, Kyrie, and Westbrook and build around them. That's how you get star players spread out to more teams"
"&gt; Have you observed any specific incidents that allow you to make that statement?"" ""Yeah,"" McGrady said, without expanding on his answer   *Anthony Davis has left the chat*"
We prefer “Anthony Day-To-Davis” but that’s still the homie.
"I don't have to. There's no way somebody with a name like ""Anthony Davis"" exists"
I don’t think their frames are all that similar. Anthony davis has big wide shoulders and Mobley has narrow shoulders and a long skinny build in general.
"They're such different players though. Even on defense. Gobert is like Grizzlies Marc Gasol or Andrew Bogut. Huge lumbering center that can basically wall of half of the paint.  Chandler was a much more mobile and athletic defender. More like a bulkier Anthony Davis. Slightly less mobile, slightly better post defender."
You’re so right! Why don’t they just draft someone like Luka or Anthony Davis who can just make them win fast! Why go with the best prospect available when they have no identity when they can just draft all nba player right out the gate.
I just tuned in. How os Russell Westbrook looking with Anthony Davis?
The owners of the pelicans are the same as the saints if I'm not mistaken and they don't seem to give the pelicans the same attention as their football team.  You have David Griffin and former Duke Blue devil and the only Alaskan born NBA player that I know of in the front office and David Griffin has been a part of some winning team's during his tenure with the Cleveland lebron's until the king banished him.  Now he's working for a team that reminds of the step child and is somewhat neglected from what it seems The way that Anthony Davis left because he didn't feel like that franchise was doing anything to be competitive or maybe being a small market they just couldn't be.  Then they get the number one pick what Zion Williamson and they appear to be potentially on the way to fucking that up also. The only conclusion is that it is just a shit run franchise and it's not the only one in the NBA You could make the same accusations towards the timberwolves and the king's. You saw it with the clippers for years during the Donald Sterling ownership sometimes a team is just run poorly from the top down and I think the pelicans might be one of those aforementioned shit run franchises.
I just never saw a possibility of Anthony Davis not succeeding
Anthony Davis
"Dame has been the best PnR scorer in the entire league statistically every single year since they started recording it with synergy stats 5 years ago.  No one in the entire league can match his combination of volume and efficiency.   There's a reason the Blazers have been the back to back #2 offense in the league despite not being close to that level of talent.  Lebron can capitalize on the switches better than Dame can, but that's *after* the PnR once things have reset. Dame demands a double at 30 feet off a screen. Imagine giving Anthony Davis wide open 15 footers or an open lane all game long with a spread floor.  With Lebron they just switch it and call it a day."
&gt; In instances where people turn to drugs to escape the banality and humiliation of the underpayed monotonous 9-5.  A true college student.  Russ definitely equals no spacing and ballhogging. The Lakers just needed a point guard that wasn't pure ass. They have Lebron James and Anthony Davis. They'll be fine.
"He obviously had good players but much worse players than almost any superstar has had when they won a ring. Love them but Jason Terry and Tyson chandler are a significant step down from guys like wade, bosh, Tony Parker, Bynum, pau, kyrie, klove, jrue, Middleton, Anthony Davis, etc."
"ah yes, notable non foul-baiters lebron james and anthony davis"
With a good number 2 like a Anthony Davis - possibly  Also needs good 3 though
This feels like Celtics biding their time for Anthony Davis only for him to go to the Lakers. Can I put a bet on Damian Lillard forcing a trade to the Knicks instead of the Sixers?
"because the lakers had assets that they could flip for anthony davis the following season. the moment lebron signed with la we were speculating about which players were gonna be shipped to new orleans.  and many free agents passed up the chance to join the lakers in prior seasons, which people wrongly attributed to them not wanting to play with kobe"
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
"&gt;It’ll be a herculean task to convince Westbrook to not play like a dumbass  He led the league in assists, and has done so for 3 of the past 4 seasons -- that's not dumb, and it's one of the most valuable skills in the league today.  And for all the complaints about his shooting, his eFG% last year was only a bit below Kobe Bryant's career number -- despite playing on a hugely-limited Wizards' roster.  So while Westbrook shouldn't be taking 4 threes a game at 31%, I'd rather he shoot those than Anthony Davis -- who launched 3 per game at an atrociously-dumb 26%.  And the Lakers saw Markieff Morris launch 3.4 per game last year, at a slightly lower accuracy than Westbrook, so it's difficult to see how Westbrook could be a negative there."

"6 Guys (James, Westbrook, Gasol, Howard, Anthony and Ariza) arguably (James and Westbrook) or completely (Gasol, Howard, Anthony and Ariza) are past their prime and a 7th (Davis) has been a proven injury liability his whole career.   I don’t think it’s a forgone conclusion they are the favorites in the West.   The Suns, Warriors, Nuggets and Jazz should have plenty to say about it."
"It's not that unjustified. Mobley is the first player to win MVP and DPOY of a power 5 conference since Anthony Davis.    They have a very similar frame, both were amazing defenders, and Mobley has a great looking touch/handle/athleticism."
"It happened on and off—taking college players who had been drafted but not yet played in the NBA:  Laettner in ‘92, no one in ‘96 or 2000, Emeka Okafor in ‘04, no one in ‘08, Anthony Davis in ‘12, no one since.  And remember, Davis was only on the squad as an injury replacement for Blake Griffin"
[Anthony Davis be like](http://31.media.tumblr.com/db24775909173cca4002b413a6f88835/tumblr_n1grk8cGRH1smcbm7o1_500.gif)
"I know who Marc Stein is. I just told you that he was the loudest cheerleader for Darko back in the 2003 draft.  I also know who LeBron is. The fact that he's still a player is really the only thing separating what he does to get players to join (cough* Anthony cough* Davis) to join him for superteams from what would be considered technically ""tampering"" if he was anyone but a player things would be different.  I'm just saying the loophole is funny."
"Without looking it up, how old do you think Anthony Davis is?"
"Bruh Anthony Davis would play 1 quarter a game and stated he didn’t want to be there, the lakers were just the match to spark the trade"
"&gt;About two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook went to LeBron James' home and together they and Anthony Davis had a conversation about the All-Star guard joining James and Davis on the Lakers.  &gt;[They talked about putting their egos aside and playing as one in their quest to bring the Lakers another NBA championship. Westbrook talked about how his only intention was winning and coming back home to Los Angeles to become a champion.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/russell-westbrook-met-with-lebron-james-anthony-davis-weeks-ago-to-discuss-playing-for-lakers-per-report/)"
But Anthony Davis on the Lakers isn’t tampering. No its foreshadowing.

"Timmy D, Dirk, Karl Malone, KG, Blake Griffin, Kevin McHale, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Charles Barkley, Pau.. so probably not, but undoubtedly one of the most impactful players on winning ever. His role was never to carry the scoring load. Dudes a future HOF without a doubt"
"This wasn’t even remotely as stacked as the US could have brought. Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, LeBron James…none of them even played. Just because the USA is exceptional at basketball doesn’t mean the medal is an asterisk. You bring your best to the Olympics. That’s how it works"
Anthony Davis.
You would think after the Anthony Davis saga that people would understand that the Lakers play with a different set of league rules.
Anthony Davis
"Anthony Davis, better defender than Embiid."
&gt;spending 25% of the year finding new ways to feed Anthony Davis  FTFY
Anthony Davis playoff records speaks itself
"That’s kind of the plan.  The glossed over part is you have the league assist leaders for the past four years running, spending all year finding new ways to feed Anthony Davis"
"Lol this is like politicians saying they should only be accused of accepting bribes if they are caught on camera taking a bag of money with a written contract in return. This entire scandal, just like with the bucks, centers around reporter leaks. But everyone, every fan and every news outlet, knew that AD was forcing his way to the Lakers and that everyone on the Lakers was available for the deal. That was common knowledge stop acting like this shit is some conspiracy.   https://sports.yahoo.com/steve-kerr-rips-anthony-davis-for-holding-pelicans-hostage-forcing-his-way-to-lakers-181657886.html  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/06/10/agent-rich-paul-calls-lakers-us/  https://lakeshowlife.com/2020/07/03/los-angeles-lakers-rich-paul-klutch-sports/  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7rbSY3qQfAI  Bruh Clutch got Harrell to opt in just so they could make the Russ deal work. Stop lying to yourself and acting like this shit is fair. The NBA babies the biggest markers and punishes the rest to keep a appearance of regulations. Shits a joke."
"In fairness though, that was for AD not playing right? Not because the Lakers were caught trying get persuade Anthony Davis to force a trade."
"So Kobe, James harden, Anthony Davis, Kyrie, Kareem on the Lakers, Dwayne wade, Shaq on the heat, Ray Allen, etc are all role players now.   Good to know. What a clown."
Anthony Davis would be pretty tight
"From another thread. Try again:  Myles Turner might be the most overrated player on every R/NBA sub. Literally every year Pacers fans and his stans flood the site after he has a 2-3 game decent stretch in the first month of the season proclaiming how he is the uncrowned DPOY, about to break out and become an all-star, the most disrespected player in the league... and like clockwork no one is ever talking about him once the season's finally done and over with. And like clockwork his team is always trying   rid of him and shopping him around the league in the ensuing offseason.  Dude is good at blocking shots... that's IT. He can't score at a high level, can't post-up, can't rebound, sets the softest screens ever, can't/won't pass the ball, has averaged basically the same statline verbatim for 6 years straight with no improvements to any facet of his game whatsoever... literally all he is good at is blocking shots. The reason why he is able to be effective in Indiana is because he has one of the most offensively skilled, best passing, best rebounding big men in the league in Sabonis next to him covering for every other facet of basketball he has been lacking in since he came into the league besides getting lots of weakside blocks.  And NO, he is not a ""stretch 5/floor spacer/etc.; outside of one season 3 years ago where he shot a little bit above league average he is a 33~% 3 pt shooter on pathetically low volume, no sane defender in the league is going to stop packing the paint vs. the league's leading inside scorer in Zion to guard him out on the perimeter. The idea of giving up our starting center and 2/3 of the amount of picks ANTHONY DAVIS went for is insanity. No."
"Me agreeing that Pop has done a better job of developing prospects than Luke Walton =/= me agreeing with your point that the Lakers' Development Staff is bad. You're really reaching by including the 2010-2014 Lakers prospects in your point because they weren't that good to begin with, and I don't need to repeat myself that you're making a hasty generalization on the Young Core Era Lakers, like I'm sorry LeBron James &amp; Anthony Davis didn't end up on your team while Kawhi held ya'll hostage"
"A Deserved victory of the United States against a great team of France.  The two best teams of the tournament were there. The gap between the USA and the best teams in the world is getting smaller and smaller.  The United States will have to send their best team in the future to avoid future big disappointments.  The French have already given the Americans a date in 2024.  The most incredible thing about Team USA is the incredible talent pool.  The Olympic champion team would probably have been beaten by a team composed of: LeBron, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Trae Young, Julius Randle."
Fuck that. The questions for the Anthony Davis AMA was embarassing.
"They need to accept we basically only had 1 player starting who would still start if all of our American players were in the player pool and thats Kevin Durant   Steph would start  So would Bron, Kawhi and Anthony Davis  Even Harden, Butler, Kyrie and Klay were out injured   Our B team still getting it done"
* PG - Stephen Curry * SG - Anthony Edwards * SF - Kevin Durant * PF - Jayson Tatum * C - Anthony Davis * Zach Lavine * Donovan Mitchell * Bam Adebayo * Zion Williamson * Cade Cunningham * Moses Moody * Trae Young
"""The rest of the world has caught up"". You guys forgetting some key USA players that aren't playing?  We didn't have lebron, curry, harden, kawhi, anthony davis, beal, chris paul, paul george etc.  Lebron, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Anthongy Davis ALL TOP 10 players in the NBA. But yeah you guys caught up to us right? LMAO what a joke."
"Based on talent:  PG - Curry  SG - Kawhi  SF - Lebron  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Anthony Davis  But i'd honestly play Jrue over Harden after this tournament, he brings so much balance to the team.  Edit: I forgot about KD lol, so not even room for Jrue."
Assuming health and everyone wanting to participate   Steph curry  James Harden  Lebron Anthony Davis Kawhi Leonard   Are the biggest names missing
This was far from the best team the USA could have fielded. The following are 2021 NBA All-Stars who weren't on the team.  Starters:  Bradley Beal  Kyrie Irving  Stephen Curry  LeBron James  Kawhi Leonard  Others:  Jaylen Brown  James Harden  Julius Randle  Mike Conley Jr.  Brandon Ingram  Donovan Mitchell  Chris Paul  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Zion Williamson
"Reminder that the 2 greatest shooters of all time, 2 best iso players in the game rn and Anthony Davis are sitting at home rn and USA still up by double digits."
"&gt; “The Lakers probably would just naturally play better easily, because Anthony Davis doesn’t need to handle the basketball to be productive,” Smith said. “Russell Westbrook can pass and assist and rebound to be productive. LeBron doesn’t need the basketball to be productive. I think that when the Nets are at their best, their best players score. So with one basketball, I would say it would be easier for the Lakers to adjust to play better together.”  How is that a ""nonsensical"" take? Just because you disagree with it?  I don't necessarily agree with him but it's very clearly a coherent opinion."
"For those who just hate Kenny and didn't read the article, here's what he said:   *“The Lakers probably would just naturally play better easily, because Anthony Davis doesn’t need to handle the basketball to be productive. Russell Westbrook can pass and assist and rebound to be productive. LeBron doesn’t need the basketball to be productive.""*  While I think playing LeBron off-ball should only be used in spurts, it's hilarious that people are already writing this trio off before they've even played a game together. Y'all know basketball better than LeBron, I guess?"
"“Stop tryna rewrite the narrative just because your biased prediction was wrong 🤡”  🧢  Can’t really talk about bias as you run around pretending that the Lakers were just some kind of plucky underdog no one believed in…cmon man.

Elgin Baylor   Wilt Chamberlain   Oscar Robertson   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   Bill Walton  David Robinson   Shaquille O’Neal   Tim Duncan   LeBron James   Anthony Davis   Zion Williamson   ————————-  All of these prospects had a floor of being an All-Star
Picking 2nd in the 2012 draft after going 7-59 (.106 winning percentage) and missing Anthony Davis and then fucking up by not picking Bradley Beal ://
Anthony Davis can suck the whole city’s balls
"At varying points Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Anthony Davis were all better than Love and it wasn't close at the time, though people pretended it was."
"I love how Lakers fans get offended by this even though their last three seasons were 100% binary outcome based on injury luck and literally nobody other than THT and the big 2 are still around from that title team.    Nobody thinks Lebron sucks, Laker fans.  Clearly the team who is dependent on Anthony Davis being healthy to make the playoffs is going to maybe not make the playoffs because he's hurt every other year.  The championship banner from two years ago isn't going to lace up it's sneakers and win a playoff game."
"I think it's more because he's one of the oldest players in the group and people here aren't as familiar with him.   He also historically lives in the shadows of MJ.   He's the best wing defender among all choices and in my hypothetical team with Trae dominating usage, and prime Draymond as a secondary ball handler, I think he'd be perfect in a role of elite defensive stopper and spot up shooter.  We're only choosing a starting line up but I also think he's got the ability to the run the offense when Trae is sitting (I'm turning egos off in this hypothetical too I guess).  Also I'm looking at the current $5 when making that claim, and while I think Nash, Anthony Davis, and David Robinson are all five star worthy, I don't think it's wise to build your team around a big man in today's NBA (Giannis notwithstanding), Pippen should absolutely be above George, and Iverson I just wouldn't want on my team.    He's also not too unpopular of a choice even here.  He's the second most commonly picked $4 behind Trae (the vast majority of ""Green's"" are Danny Green), though tbf if he had been $5 I'm not sure if I would have chosen him."
Bradley Beal = LeBron and Anthony Davis? What the fuck are you talking about
"He would be like if Giannis was twice as good on offence while being a much less versatile defender.   He would single handedly double the wealth of the average 7 foot man, as teams would be forced spend their MLEs on big bodies to soak up minutes against Shaq.  If he kept his weight to Orlando Shaq levels though he would be elite on both ends.  Anthony Davis would never play another minute at center again."
"Beal was out when the Wiz were fighting for a PLAY-IN spot and during those play-in games and Russ put up great performances to get that team to the playoffs.   So you're saying you put Russ on a team with fucking Lebron James and Anthony Davis, and that's the same as the team he was on last year where the best player after him and Brad was who? Rui? Bertans? Get the fuck outta here."
"Giannis lacks the fluidity, he is a bit stiff, even though he is very agile for a guy his size. I think only Anthony Davis is close to Hakeem when it comes to fluidity of movement at that size. But AD doesn't have the mentality and toughness of Hakeem."
"I went looking through the advanced stats, focusing on the top 30 single season rankings for PER, Total Win Shares, Box Plus/Minus and VORP. A couple folks jump into the All-time Top 25 conversation.   I was a bit surprised at how many top notch regular seasons Kawhi has had-- I tend to think of him as a playoff monster. But he's a dominant contender for bursting into the all-time ranks. And Giannis is already coming on strong, too:  **Kawhi Leonard (2017 &amp; 2021 PER, 2019 Win Shares, 2016, 2017 &amp; 2021 Box Plus/Minus, 2019 VORP)**  **Giannis (2020 PER, 2020 Box Plus/Minus, 2021 VORP)**  Chris Paul, Damian Lillard and Anthony Davis each have had dominant years that could be considered top 25 all-time:   **Chris Paul (2008 PER, 2008 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Damian Lillard (2021 PER, 2021 Box Plus/Minus)**  **Anthony Davis (2020 PER, 2020 Win Shares)**  I'm not sure if Dirk Nowitzi and Dwayne Wade are already considered top 25 all-time, but based on their dominant year in 2006, they probably should be:  **Dirk Nowitzki (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  **Dwayne Wade (2006 Win Shares, 2010 Box Plus/Minus, 2006 VORP)**  But all of those folks are probably not big surprises, and will probably be in the top 25 debate eventually, if they're not already. The one that I think really forces his way into the conversation is Anfernee Hardaway, who had a dominant year in 1997:  **Anfernee Hardaway (1997 PER, 1997 Box Plus/Minus)**  There were other players who had dominant years in these categories, but not appearing in the top 30 in more than one category. Unless you count George Mikan, but I know most of you don't..."
Anthony Davis trade validated that
Anthony Davis went to a blue blood school where he won a national championship and was POTY.  He was way closer to Zion than Cade in terms of popularity.
And Anthony Davis is not a good 3pt shooter
"""This is Anthony Davis. Rajon Rondo's trying to get into the locker room!"""
"even if he doesnt see a minute of playoffs (which i doubt) this is a great signing nonetheless. he was a key part of that culture, is the anthony davis whisperer, and is a great vet presence for the right teams (which clearly rondo feels the lakers are). this is quite possibly the only team that rondo can maximize his effectiveness like this, and the only team he is going to be willing to work his hardest for."
"Who would you out over Anthony Davis? I'm curious. He was never able to lead the Pels to a chip but in the Lakers championship year the only player I'd have over him is Lebron, maybe Giannis. Being the same caliber with those guys is pretty obviously great."
I'm taking   Kenny Smith $2 Alex Caruso $1 Lamar Odom $2 Anthony Davis $5 David Robinson $5
"Lol what are you talking about, he was playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves, absolutely no shame in not making the playoffs. Anthony Davis made the playoffs only twice in the 7 years he was in NOLA, one of which was a clean sweep, the other he got bounced in the 2nd round. That doesn't change the fact that AD was a top 5 player for his prime and top 10 for most of the time he was in NOLA.   When you're playing for a shit tier franchise like the Pelicans, Cavs, or Twolves, there's literally nothing you can do short of being LeBron James, a top 2 player ALL TIME. And even then, I doubt he consistently makes the playoffs if his team was in the western conference like the Twolves and Pelicans.   KLove spent only the beginning of his short prime in Minnesota, and he was definitely a top 10 player. Keep in mind the best stars in the league at the time were either aging or in their early years. Prime KLove would definitely not be a top 10 player in today's league. Even so, you so clearly have never watched Fat Love play."
"I want you to watch this https://youtu.be/RZn0M-c8cTA and tell me his accuracy is bad. At 2:15 he hits caunginton who's cutting with a nasty bounce pass, his passing is way more than just ""hitting the open man with bad accuracy"", he's dealing with a ton of momentum and controlling his arms extremely well. And he's a better passer now since that video was 2 years ago, last season he averaged more assists than Anthony Davis who is the other elite PF in the league and just as a fun fact, more than Zion who was playing point forward for a large chunk of last season. Basketball is a game of skill, no one is saying his athleticism doesnt help him but you don't hit his level without being skilled."
"People in this thread are weird. Sports attracts alpha dog assholes, and the nba is a business based on winning. Lebron traded the entire lakers team behind their backs to land Anthony Davis but kids in this thread have a stick up their butt about Kobe telling it like it is to the 2015 team. Maybe Kobe was a little self righteous about his legacy but I don’t think what he’s doing is unusual."
"“LeBron has done as much as Jordan with a lot less”   Lmao yeah poor bron. Must be hard having Dwayne Wade, Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis as your teammates."
"You would rather have Dame, Tatum or Paul George than Anthony Davis has the best player on your team?"
"Chris Paul, James harden, Scottie pippen, Anthony Davis, Hakeem Olajuwon"
"You should re-read what you wrote out loud to see how silly it sounds. Your claim is that Rich Paul and LeBron somehow made AD hire RP against his will, just so RP could force the Pelicans to trade AD to the Lakers to help LeBron. Is that correct? What if, now hear me out on this, but what if AD simply wanted to go play with his boyhood hero, LeBron? If he did want that, wouldn't Rich Paul be the best agent to hire to make that happen? Because it should be pointed out that [just a couple months before AD made that trade request, he hired Rich Paul.](https://www.nba.com/news/anthony-davis-signs-klutch-sports-rich-paul-agent?amp=1)"
"I see someone downvoted you for this, because clearly people around here hate this idea for some reason. I've seen the same weird thing with Kawhi and people saying he's only doing what Uncle Dennis tells him. Like no, these guys are grown men who have their own wants and desires and they tell their agents where they want to go.   I think a lot of people want to feel like the game was just fine before these agents came along, and they want to be able to still like the players, so they just dump all the blame for the choices they made that fans don't like onto someone else. Anthony Davis hired Rich Paul because he wanted to go to the Lakers and he hired the guy best qualified to get him there. If Zach LaVine does the same thing, that's because that's what he wants, not because LeBron or Rich Paul hypnotized him or are blackmailing him or whatever.   People need to take a closer look at exactly why they blame Rich Paul for whatever stuff that's gone on in the NBA that they don't like. He's not the Boogeyman, he's just an agent. He works for his clients, not the other way around. They can fire him if they don't like how he's representing them. None of us knows the conversations that are taking place between these agents and the players. It's quite frankly absurd that any of us act like we're privy to that information."
Anthony Davis won with Lebron. Completely laughable to think Zach Lavine of all players would be a lure for AD
No disrespect man but his shady conniving helped us get Anthony Davis. It worked out great from my perspective!  And the Pelicans owner has done much worse things than Paul has ever done so I’m not exactly having a moral dilemma about the transaction
"&gt;But you gotta admit, failing to act in the best interest of your players is a very shitty thing to do.  If that's actually what he did then sure. But none of us knows the truth there, there's just allegations. I didn't witness any of it so I have no clue how true any of it is. I'm guessing if it was that cut and dry then he wouldn't be apparently on the verge of signing another high profile player, but maybe I'm wrong. If he fucked up, he should pay him.   &gt;But we both know you are somehow working a deeper reason (I'll bet $5 I know what it is) despite the legit criticism he gets.  I know you think it's just cause I'm a Laker fan, but I promise you that's not it, or not in the way that you think it is, anyway. Honestly I just think all the criticism around here in recent days is insincere. I don't think people here hate Rich Paul cause of doing a poor job of representing Nerlens Noel, I think they hated him before this all came out. I think most people here are happy this happened because they want to see RP taken down, and that happiness has absolutely nothing to do with Noel. I don't think people here give a shit about Nerlens Noel, they just want reasons to hate Rich Paul.   I think a lot of people have hated him for a bunch of reasons which aren't the kinds of things that would upset me. Some people hate him because of his connection to LeBron and see hating him as an extension of hating LeBron. Some people hate him because they see him as helping the Lakers, and they hate the Lakers. Some people probably hate him because of his politics (again, more of an extension for why they hate LeBron). And unfortunately some people probably hate him because they don't like that a black man without a college degree is one of the most powerful agents in sports.   None of these things are upsetting to me, so I don't have the same motivations to hate him that a lot of other people do. That's probably why it seems like I'm ""defending"" him when really I'm just not joining in in attacking him. For me finding out that some player's agent may have made mistake while representing him has the same impact as if I'd found out that Noel's accountant had misfiled his taxes. That's not my business so I don't really give a shit. And that's why my reaction to everyone going crazy over this makes me want to just say that I wish people were honest about *why* they were so ""upset"" rather than this ""poor Noel"" concern trolling that's going on.   Finally, I'll just say that in regards to this thread, if Zach LaVine is going to hire Rich Paul because he wants to end up on the Lakers, that's not Rich Paul's fault or his doing. That's cause Zach LaVine wanted to do that. People tried to act like Anthony Davis wanted to stay in New Orleans until Rich Paul and LeBron lured him away, but we're talking about grown men making their own decisions, not young children being lured into a van with candy by sinister older men. If there's a problem with player movement or player empowerment, then it's nothing that Rich Paul created, nor will it go away if he does. Blaming him for all the perceived problems with how the business of the NBA works is silly, IMO."
"Who were probably the biggest unrestricted free agents this summer? You had guys like Kawhi, Conley, and Chris Paul who just re-signed with their teams (and that could happen with LaVine, of course). But what about guys like Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan? They were unrestricted but ended up getting signed and traded elsewhere. So the same could happen with big unrestricted free agents next summer as well, right?  So of course, the big question is ""why would the Bulls sign and trade LaVine next summer?"" Well first he'd have to make them believe he's going to leave no matter what. He could do that by threatening to go to Orlando, San Antonio or Detroit. That's probably how Kyle Lowry got Toronto to send him to Miami: by making them think if they didn't then he'd go sign with New Orleans and they'd get nothing in return. At least now they have Precious and Dragic, right?  So if LaVine wanted to go to say, the Lakers (this is Klutch, after all), all he'd have to do is convince the Bulls that they're going to lose him either way, and then they'll feel like they'd be better off getting something for him rather than nothing. So then all the Lakers would have to do to offer him a 4 year max at $154 million in a sign and trade is send back matching salary for that first year at $35.7 million. If only the Lakers had a big expiring contract they could send... Oh yeah, Westbrook will only have one year left on his contract next summer, they could send him! They also could send Chicago native Talen Horton-Tucker or their first round pick in 2027, 2028 or 2029 if needed.   So there you go. If you're a conspiracy theorist and you're wondering why LaVine might sign with Klutch, well it could be for the same reason Anthony Davis did. Or maybe he plans to just re-sign with the Bulls and wants Rich Paul to represent him. We'll have to wait and see."
Trae Young will average at or better than 30/10 a game this season. Anthony Davis will win a finals MVP in the next 2 years.
1. With Russ and Lebron feeding him Anthony Davis will have a career year and establish himself as the definitive best player on the team and in the West.  2. SGA will establish himself as a top 5 guard in the NBA within the next three seasons

"it's stupid to take stats out of context like that.  The Lakers are 9th because they were complete garbage for like 6 years before LeBron  came and they traded the results of 6 years of tanking for Anthony Davis. The Lakers have either been title contenders or hot garbage, for like 75% of this century, while most of the teams above them on this list were consistently solid and straight up never bottomed out."
Omg I just remembered this. Remember when Anthony Davis or Rich Paul forced his way off the Pelicans and people were acting like Davis was more responsible than Paul for this move? Funny how people are mad at a Paul now instead of Noel and acting like he had more agency. It was insane how many Lakers fans were apologizing for Paul back then.
Davis? Anthony Davis is never a minus on defense unless he’s injured. Harrell and Drummond were the major liabilities.

"There's a huge gap between a player saying ""I would prefer to be traded to one of these destinations"" and a player having their agent canvas potential landing spots and talk those places out of trading for his client.  Rich Paul admitted to talking to teams and convincing them NOT to trade for Davis. Can you really not see the difference?  And that's before we get into the other level of fuckery in this specific situation. Rich Paul owes his career to LeBron. LeBron is Rich Paul's most important client. Rich Paul torpedoed the chances of NoLa trading Davis to anywhere but LeBron James' team.  LeBron James co-founded Klutch, Rich Paul's agency. The Anthony Davis situation was so clearly tampering orchestrated by LeBron, forcing NoLa to trade AD to his team, using the agency he founded."
Except they will see Rudy Gobert and Myles Turner sticking to Anthony Davis and actually understand the context of LeBron scoring.
"&gt; NBA agent Rich Paul says he warned the Boston Celtics about trading for Anthony Davis for their own good.   &gt;Paul told ESPN’s Dave McMenamin — in a report Tuesday about how the All-NBA big man’s blockbuster deal from the New Orleans Pelicans to the Los Angeles Lakers went down — **that he tried to persuade other suiters, like the Celtics, against mortgaging their future for Davis.**  &gt; “The last thing you want to do is put a GM in a situation where he trades away an asset and then the guy walks out the door,” he said. “Like, you can’t do business that way. So it’s not really a hard conversation to have.”  &gt; Paul — who represents a number of high-profile stars, including Davis and his new Lakers teammate LeBron James — **had made it clear at the time that his 26-year-old client would likely leave in free agency next summer if the Celtics acquired him from the Pelicans.**  &gt;“I don’t think it stopped Danny Ainge from trying,” he told ESPN.  &gt;The Celtics had tried to compete with the Lakers’ trade offers last June and some fans urged the team to go all in for Davis, a franchise-caliber talent. Ainge has reportedly coveted the six-time All-Star for years. However, according to Paul, he ultimately “wasn’t willing to give up the young players.” While the Celtics were reportedly open to trading some combination of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, or Marcus Smart, they weren’t willing to match the package of players and draft picks that the Lakers ultimately sent to the Pelicans for Davis — especially if he might leave Boston after one season.   &gt;“I don’t blame him,” Paul said. “I wouldn’t give them up either if the guy is not going to re-sign.”  &gt;Davis had narrowed his preferred destinations to the Lakers and the New York Knicks — and Paul pushed to make sure other teams knew that. **David Griffin, the Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations, told ESPN that Paul “had done such an effective job of smoking out all of the competition” that the team realized they wouldn’t get a better deal than what had been offered by the Lakers.**  &gt;**In May, Paul told Sports Illustrated that the Celtics could trade for Davis, “but it’ll be for one year.” Shortly after Davis first requested a trade in February, his father also spoke out against the idea of his son playing for the Celtics, “after what they [had] done to Isaiah Thomas,” who was traded for Kyrie Irving while recovering from a hip injury he sustained during the 2017 playoffs, which derailed his career.**  &gt;Paul didn’t express opposition to the concept of Davis playing for the Celtics, but said he made the risk clear to the team.  &gt;“**If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020,” he told SI. “I’ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don’t blame Rich Paul.”**  The 'Ainge has no loyalty' narrative was steaming hot at this time and the quote was used at the perfect time when Celtics seemed ready to finally pull the trigger on AD now that it was clear he wasn't staying in New Orleans. Just seems awfully coincidental."
"&gt;just off the top of my head: Draymond, Anthony Davis, Siakam, Anunoby, Bam, Giannis, Zion,  Ben Simmons is a better defender than most of those guys."

"&gt; Gareth Bale to Real Madrid is Anthony Davis to Lakers. He tries to win with his old team, but ultimately couldn't and once he got his move,he became a winner  &gt; Pogba to United is James Harden to Rockets. Enigmatic player who had succes with his last team and tried hard to win it all with the next one, but couldn't get over the hump. Now wants to join a sure thing in PSG/Nets  Excuse me what? Bale spent a lot of time being benched at Real so idk what you call him. And for Man U Pogba is more like Wiggins. All the potential and dominates for his country but in his club (Minny) he looks like a FA bust more often than not. Hopefully he finds his Warriors though and can maintain consistency."
"Sloan was not a good coach. He had two top twenty players for twenty years and never got it done. He had no imagination. Stockton was a career .384 three point shooter, and only took 1.5 a game. They just ran that pick and roll to death. Is that great coaching? And what success did Sloan have after Stockton and Malone?   The only reason Stockton and Malone don't have rings is because of those Jordan Bulls. Saying Stockton was the fourth best player (Rodman was not better than him) on the floor during those finals is not an insult. Pippen is extremely underrated because people like to give Jordan all the credit, and even he (Pippen) arguably chould be over KD at this point. He was a great offensive player and a MONSTER defender, and those Bulls (contrary to popular belief) won championships more with their defense than their offense. The Horace Grant, Pippen, Jordan (first trilogy) then Rodman, Pippen, Jordan (second trilogy) three headed defensive monster is what made them unbeatable.   I am not trying to rip KD. He will probably be top 10 or 12 when all is said and done. But this recency bias just gets my back up. People dismiss Stockton's career so easily. It's bullshit. KD had the same issue winning it all with his original team as Barkley, Stockton, Malone, KG, Anthony Davis, you name it. He doesn't deserve a higher status because he joined a super team. In fact, I think it's just the opposite. I give more cred to the people who stayed with one team whether they won a championship or not."
Anthony Davis and Leader are 2 words that don't go together. I understand there a a bunch of different ways to lead a team but I've never heard a player or coach mention AD leadership as a strong attribute.
For 2020? Anthony Davis lol
"2020 - Anthony Davis close out Game 6 - 19 pts, 15 reb, 3 assists, 2 blocks, 1 steal  2021 - Giannis close out game 6 - 50 pts, 14 reb, 2 assists, 5 blocks  AD career playoffs - 27/10/3  Giannis career playoffs - 26/11/5  Giannis made the run as the best player on his team, AD has never been to a conference finals as the best player on his"
It’s not misleading you just have your own narrative you tryna push. And you dumb   https://www.google.com/amp/s/lakeshowlife.com/2021/06/03/los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-injury-history-updates/amp/
"Anthony Davis had an argument to be the best player maybe for 1-2 seasons max if any at all. The top 10 consists of: 1. LeBron 2. Durant 3. Kawhi 4. Curry 5. Giannis 6. Jokic 7. Embiid 8. Harden 9. Luka 10. Dame/AD  The top 10 are not in perfect order, listed them as I remembered."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/lakeshowlife.com/2021/06/03/los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-injury-history-updates/amp/  You fucking dumb lol now go and delete your dumbass comment
"Assuming they sign the deal today for the next 5 years:  **100% worth it**:  * Lebron (idc how old he is he's still the best player when he plays)  * Jokic  * Giannis (I honestly am not as big on Giannis as most but I would be raked over the coals if I left him off)  * Luka  * Harden  * KD  * Tatum (people might disagree but he's a durable two-way player with a very high floor, so even if he doesn't develop anymore I think it's worth it or almost worth it)  These are guys who are not big injury risks and can be the best player on a championship team.  KD is the biggest injury risk but he is good enough and just durable enough to definitely be worth it.  And none of them are big defensive liabilities.  **99% worth it**:  * Kawhi  * Curry  Great players that can lead their team but may have age/injury risks tied to them.    **I basically think that all of the players below this are unlikely to win a championship if they are on a supermax.**  **Worth it but it's a risk**:  * Embiid (he's the second best big in the league but is a pretty big injury risk)  * Zion  * Jimmy Butler (he's a great all-around player and a winner, but he's not quite as good as everyone above him on this list)  * Paul George (before this postseason run he probably wouldn't have been in this tier)  * Donovan Mitchell (he's a good player, I think the risk is that he never quite reaches superstar potential, but it would likely be a slight overpay rather than a complete waste)  * KAT (young player who's a beast on offense, bad defensively, no success whatsoever)  * Trae Young (he's small and a terrible defender so he will need to become a player almost as good as Curry to be worth it)  * Ja Morant  **Not worth it, but would get it**:  * Lillard (bad defensively, no playoff success)  * Anthony Day-to-Davis (can't stay healthy, has proven he cannot be THE guy)  * Bradley Beal (i don't think this would handicap a team, but i don't think he's quite a superstar)  * Russell Westbrook (no idea if he would get it at this point in his career, but i bet some team would give it to him)  I don't think Devin Booker would get it, but he would probably fall into this list.  Although he's another guy that prob wouldn't handicap a team on a supermax, he just probably wouldn't ever fully live up to it.  And I don't think CP3 would get it today at his age.  ***Might* be worth it, but prob wouldn't get it**:  * Anthony Edwards  * LaMelo Ball  * SGA  * Jamal Murray  * De'Aaron Fox  Did I miss anyone?"
Anthony Davis long mid range shooting: entire career before the bubble playoffs was 37.9% and his 3pt shooting was 31.9%. During the bubble playoffs he shot 55.2% (long mid) &amp; 38.3% (3pt). After the bubble he's been even worse (altho injured as was mentioned) at  33% &amp; 26 %
"Alright lol I'd rather have him do that than Anthony Davis backing up and taking a contested jumpshot over Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole in the GSW Play-In rather than going to the paint. Do you think a ""skilled"" player doesn't know how to use his skills?"
"Anthony Davis was selected before even being in the NBA as the next in line. Rich Paul, Lebron James, all of them made the decision for AD. He took HGH in college too, he was like 6""4 and then shot to 7"". Rich Paul came to him gave him the HGH and said take this and you'll be the face of the NBA and that's why he was on the USA team before being drafted and that's why he's on the Lakers with Lebron and he's never been good enough to deserve any of this but Rich Paul just tryna cash in and create the next wave. AD ain't good don't believe the hype. The Crown Has Returned From Overseas"
Anthony “The Southern Dandy” Davis
"Pels  PG: CP3, Lonzo  SG: Jrue, Eric Gordon, Buddy Hield  SF: Trevor Ariza,  Solo Hill....  PF: Anthony Davis, Aminu  C: Demarcus Cousins, Christian Wood  &amp;#x200B;  So probably Thunder."
"I don't need to go back to watch Duncan highlights because I actually watched him play in the 2000s. You're attributing way too much of the Spurs team success to Tim Duncans basketball skills.  The Spurs were winning 60 games a season before they drafted him. And they won 60 games after he retired. This ridiculous idea that one player simply being on the team is the entire reason for their success, regardless of their performance, is silly.   Those 2000s Spurs were like the Utah Jazz last year. Unselfish, well coached team that all played defense and routinely got the #1/#2 seed.  It wasnt some mediocre cast carried by Duncan like we've seen with LeBron, Curry, even Luka, etc. He never had the offensive skill to take over a game like that   Hell in many of those Spurs years either going to the finals or winning he wasn't their leading scorer. How is Duncan's putting up 18/11 on a championship season better than Anthony Davis putting up 29/12/4/2/2 and losing in the second round.   You may as well say Khris Middleton is better than Paul George cause the Bucks won."
"The blazers are like one hall of fame big man away from maybe winning a title..  Jokes aside this is sort of why I really wish they had gone for Anthony Davis at the deadline two years ago. Keep him as a six month rental, try to convince him to sign an extension, and if it doesn’t work you just unload him at the off-season since he still has a year left on his deal"
Anthony Davis is 27
LeBron was NOT top 2 in the race before his injury. The race was always between Embiid and Jokic. LeBron got some media love as he always does but without Anthony Davis he was 11-7.
"Unless Anthony Davis magically turns into a great 3-point shooter (like he always seems to against the Jazz), I'd be surprised if the Lakers were able to beat the Jazz, they just won't have enough shooting to pull Gobert away from the rim.   And defensively, I have no idea how the Lakers defend the Jazz backcourt, one of the more underplayed storylines in the Lakers offseason is just how much the their perimeter defense downgraded. They were amazing before and now they are below average at best."
"I don't understand how giving observations as a spectator is ""high levels of delusion,"" especially when I want that player to win. It's just like me pointing out that the only reason we won games against the Suns was because Anthony Davis was getting fouls for being touched. Just keeping it real"
I'll bite on that one.  Having watched both in their prime I'm struggling to think of a single area of basketball that Anthony Davis isn't better than Tim Duncan at.  Duncan is the better passer. And probably a better rebounder. In basically every area of scoring and offense AD is superior. And  AD is a much better help defender and perimiter defender while still being great in the post.  Other than playing for a great team that won a lot what exactly does Duncan give you over AD?
"Gobert is an elite pain defender, that’s undeniable. But he’s not that versatile compared to someone like Giannis or Anthony Davis, who while aren’t as lockdown in the post, are way better perimeter defenders"
"Yeah it's tough to wrap around but since it could work, that would be one hell of a scoring frontcourt. I think Kobe and West and Kareem are locked in. Shaq's inclusion should be a debate, I haven't formed that proper conclusion yet.  Heat LeBron would be a perfect power forward but this LeBron has slimmed down and he isn't shooting 40% and being a roll man. A lineup that needs interior presence WOULD have Anthony Davis at the four had Shaq been benched.  Also, since the starting point guard is too controversial it's a toss-up between bron and magic for a lot of people.  So, just remember that the best 3pt shooter on the team is West and the way that threes are shot today, he'd be a perfect knockdown shooter and not to mention a great perimeter defender. Steve Nash's shooting with excellent defense. A top 5 guard ever.  And Kobe is also on the team and is going to love playing with a West that's being double teamed on the perimeter.  Removing West is detrimental and this team kills the competition inside and out, I know we weren't alive, but people forgot all of West's finals performances, man oh man. Then imagine that game in the modern NBA?  James does everything magic can and better at PG, especially for the modern league. 2000 Shaquille O'Neal is switching and creating mismatches with Kareem. Kareem is a PF on offense and a center on defense. Vice versa for Shaq, and he can adapt, it isn't impossible."

Anthony Davis is 4x all NBA 1st team. Compared to Mutumbos 0.  He averages 24/10/2/2/2 for his career vs. 9/10/1/0/2 for Mutumbo.  Beyond the stats I also just have eyeballs and have watched both players play and it's absolutely ridiculous to think Mutumbo is a better player.
"Last year Russ had the lowest True Shooting &amp; of anyone who could be considered a superstar. By a decent bit (.509) The next worse is surprisingly Anthony Davis who shot a TS of .556 and has a few hundred players between him and Russ  &amp;#x200B;  Giannis had the 44th best TS% of all players with .633  Steph, KD, Gobert (depending on your definition of superstar) and mostly a bunch of bigs who mainly score under the basket were above him  &amp;#x200B;  True Shooting is not perfect, drawing in effective FG% could help here too among other things."
Anthony Davis is much more accomplished than Mutumbo. No debate AD should be up there.  For the other guys would probably put both Kyrie and Paul George over T Mac but it's close.
"Anthony Davis isn’t a superstar, lol. He had one hot bubble run after showing no signs of hitting jump shots consistently"

"I don’t think players who were eligible and had played the bulk of their careers the last time should be added.

"OP is adding up to 75. Not top 50.  With that said, Mutumbo is definitely not on that list. And I'd even argue T Mac shouldn't be on there either.  Notable players not in OPs top 25 since 1997:  - Anthony Davis - Paul George - Jimmy Butler - Paul Pierce - Kyrie Irving - Pau Gasol - Chris Bosh - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili - Blake Griffin"
Anthony Davis should be a center

Who is Anthony Davis?
&gt; Anthony Davis fakes injuries during bad games so that he can get high in the locker room  LMFAO
"&gt;I will also add that my buddy and I saw Kareem on Kauai in 1987 and his big ass was wearing a silver speedo on the beach. It was weird.  Haha, man that's a great story man. So Kareem is pretty locked in at the center position. And since his feet were slow, the four would be awful.  Shaq normally slid into the paint from the perimeter, moved amazing for his size, and was just really great at slithering in.   Shaq can be better off playing the 5 for his team but for THIS team, stretching the floor wouldn't be a bad idea. He can be an inside-out big like Thomas Bryant on my Wizards.  Now the biggest question is if Shaq should be benched to accommodate an Anthony Davis, a James Worthy, and if so, would it be enough spacing for Magic to start instead of LeBron or not?"
Anthony Davis should've won DPOY in 2020
Anthony Davis game winner against the Nuggets last year
"Cade Cunningham will be better than Michael Jordan  Luka Doncic will be better than Cade Cunningham  Anthony Davis fakes injuries during bad games so that he can get high in the locker room   Blake Griffin is a serial killer  Kawhi didn't choke against the Nuggets, his knees couldn't handle the strain and he'll never get passed the 2nd round without copious amounts of rest during the playoffs   From watching Harlem Globetrotter games in the 70s, I can tell that NBA players back then were certainly capable of being great ball handlers by today's standards, and not untalented white dudes who couldn't dribble like people on here say. Frankly, the strict rules did not allow them to do things with the ball that players are allowed to do now.   Steph Curry's foot fetish is breaking his family apart  Fox is a future superstar because he's an insanely efficient finisher for a point guard; he's just too good at the rim  When Zion plays in the 2024 Olympics, it's over. His game is absolutely made for Olympic ball. He brings the finishing and physicality that no one on Team USA had."
"lakers all time team is so fucking good, its some combination of (ALL IN THEIR PRIMES):  goat candidates: lebron, kareem  top 10 of all time: shaq, magic, kobe, wilt  all time greats: jerry west, elgin baylor, james worthy, george mikan  hall of famers: pau gasol, anthony davis, derek fisher  That's INSANE. Lakers have never gone more than like 5 years without two top 10 players in the league on their team"
"He represents Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons to name a few other big contracts. Both make over 35m a year, while Lebron makes 42m. He also represents guys like Lonzo Ball and John Wall who have contracts above the league average. He's making 13m in commission off those 4 contracts over the next 5 years probably, by the end of Lebrons career he could have made close to 30m easily, especially considering he has so many young players under contract, if even one gets a max that's another big payday. All that mainly because of insider connections, and free exposure from having Lebron as a best friend/Premium client"
"Lol yes, they beat the Nuggets and the corpse of the Heat with that lineup. You also conveniently neglected the fact that Anthony Davis' shooting was completely anomalous. He looked like Dirk Nowitzki."
"I mean, Anthony Davis forced his way out of New Orleans with exactly one destination in mind. Montrezl Harrell jumping from the Clippers to the Lakers for very little difference in money really upset his former teammates.   Even on a lesser note, you have the entire saga of LeGM in Cleveland where it felt like it was half Klutch guys. I don't necessarily think it's THAT much of a stretch."
"Is there an aspect here of treating some of these second and third tier guys as complement pieces for clients like Lebron James and Anthony Davis? Like when a team like the Lakers has little cap space so he might use those guys to fill those rolls, instead of a better and longer contract somewhere else."
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
Their youngest starter is Anthony Davis who will totally absolutely without doubt stay completely totally absolutely healthy this season.
"No, but the guy who represents clients such as Draymond Green, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, John Wall, Lebron James, and Anthony Davis probably is a legitimate agent. Noel happened to get the short end of his attention and got fucked over because of it."
"People seem to forget that as phenomenal as Hakeem was, this is not an era that is dominated from big men.  People compare him to Embiid but the later has never been past the 2nd round even with stacked teams.  Hakeem doesn't shoot 3's and overal if a center is your best player than likely you don't have the firepower to be at the top. See Anthony Davis for example.  I won't put Hakeem above KD, Steph, Kawhi and Giannis."
"This is an exaggeration. They only went into the luxury tax one year with Harden. All his peers except for Anthony Davis were on teams that paid the luxury tax multiple times throughout the 2010s. They Rockets also went small ball for Westbrook and not Harden in 2020. Even getting Westbrook was not doing exactly what Harden wanted. Harden wanted to add Jimmy Butler to the team. The main concerns about CP3 were really health based at the time, and the lack of depth on the Rockets didn't allow either CP3 or Harden (or even PJ Tucker) to take a break when needed, so they went into the playoffs in 2019 banged up."
He is not as good as the following players Lebron  Kd  Giannis  Kawhi  Luka  Paul George  Steph  Dame  Klay  Embiid  Jimmy butler   Donovan Mitchell  Nikola jokic  Jamal Murray  Tatum  Rudy gobert  Bradley beal  Trae young  Kyrie Irving  James Harden   Anthony Davis  Devin Booker   Chris paul  So I put him around the top 25ish
Here we go again…   Lebron was clearly not 100% against the suns. He’d been dealing with a couple of ankle sprains leading into the playoffs which affected his explosiveness.   And Anthony Davis has been a better playoff player than Harden historically.   And Russ is a complete wildcard.   Lakers in 7. that’s how normal fans think.
anthony davis and dwight howard are swatting that weak shit
Anthony Davis all over again. Rich Paul is a cancer for the league.
"Bucks use to do this!  I remember it was like a 10 game package, that was just the hot teams to watch. Heatles era.  God. I remember sitting and reading the milwaukee journal sentinal in the break room, reading about how bad the Bucks were, but that at least we had Larry Sanders (whoops) and that giannis had potential.  &amp;#x200B;  My dad and I sat a few rows from the court for $50 total, which was marketed as come watch Anthony Davis of the Pelicans! He scored 40 pts that night, so truth be told, it was an awesome game."
Fair point. Anthony Davis is a youthful 28.
"I think JR could have been a tremendous player if he ever put it together, and he had a ton of offensive potential too...       I watched the video you linked but geniunely I don't understand how you that supports what you said.  In the video, he gets to a pullup, he takes it off the rim and goes full court, he drives from the perimeter, he posts up. If you are using the fact he missed shots while being guarded by Anthony Davis and LeBron James as evidence he is incapable of doing any of those things, I'm not really sure what to say.  Sure, I think there has been some miscommunication on the timeline - I don't think he's gonna come in this year and average 20 on 50% FG, but I do expect a scoring jump with the extra shots he'll get. What I was getting at was Isaac is capable of doing a lot of those things now, he just needs to put it together. I think he can become a 20ppg guy long term."
"So what? He's a fairly heavily dependent offensive player. Nobody wants Anthony Davis isolation possessions in a close game and he's not a good enough playmaker, either."
"Yeah top 3 is a stretch. On the top of my head i think Durant, Giannis, and Anthony Davis are better than him currently."
I would prefer the Lebron and James duo... Anthony and DAvis are good too.
Why would any team want a guy who puts in so little effort? It sounds like he will immediately quit trying if the situation isn't perfect. At least Anthony Davis was willing to keep playing when he demanded a trade.
Anthony Davis remained with the Pelicans after the trade deadline when he asked out. Simmons has 4 years left on a deal so it's not like Jimmy Butler situation. Rockets waited until they got the most they could have form the Nets for Harden.  I just don't see anything Simmons does impacting his trade value. Simmons saying he would start the season playing with the Sixers wouldn't make Kings offer Fox. Simmons won't play and the best offer will get marginally better closer we get to the deadline (either start of the camp or trade deadline) and return will be bad from the Sixers perspective.
Anthony Davis? Westbrook?
Anthony Davis with league average durability
It’s a small sample size when he’s only been in two new situations before this year with one being a below average Wizards team.  He’s playing alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis this time
"I guess my response to that is ""What does it matter?""  It seems like misdirection.   My point is that Barkley is being hypocritical.   Barkley played for at team for 8 seasons that was getting worse and missed the playoffs.   Anthony Davis played for the Pels for seven years and they were getting worse.   They both requested a trade to a contender.   So why is Barkley bitching about this?   He's like an old man bitching about kids doing things he used to do as a kid.   But to your question, which has nothing to do with what I said, I would say this: When teams put guys on the trading block, teams would be upset if they refused to play until they got a deal.   For example, the Celtics put Ray Allen up on the block and were openly shopping him.   He still played.   The Sixers put Simmons up on the block earlier this year when trying to get Harden.  He still played.   I can express to my boss that I'm not happy with a given situation at work and that I'd like things to improve or I'll eventually leave for a better opportunity. In the mean time, I'm still going to expect that I'll work.   So AD wants to play and wants to compete, but wants to do so on a better team. Requests a trade. If the team doesn't want to play him, so be it, I guess. But I don't have an issue with AD not being happy about the team not playing him.   &amp;#x200B;  This all comes down to fans supporting their team over their players.   If a player on their team leaves in free agency, which is their right, teams get pissed. You saw LeBron jerseys being burned. KD getting ripped by OKC fans. Happens all the time. But when the guy lets the team know his intentions and gives them a chance to move him for assets, suddenly he's an even bigger asshole?  Doesn't make sense to me.   The Pelps fucked up. They had a once-in-a-generation talent and they failed to even win a game in the second round in seven seasons.   They had their time. The fired the coach who helped the team get better. That's on the Pels. They fucked up.   Even after they get a haul for Davis, what do they do? They let their point guard go.   So now it turns into two starters (Ingram dropping 23/5/5 and Ball with improve 3pt shooting dropping nearly 14/6a/5r), turns into a team in dire need of a point guard.   You think Zion is going to stick around for that kind of tomfoolery?  They will be taking a step back in a year when they should be pushing for the playoffs because of this woeful front office."
"Is there any other AD i dont know about? Anthony davis is 28, which has historically been the prime years of past NBA greats"
Except this isn't true at all. Anthony Davis never refused to play. The pelicans made the decision to not play him before the trade deadline so his trade value wouldn't be tanked by an injury.
"LeBron ruined the NBA the last 10 years. I used to be a hardcore to the highest degree and I haven’t watched a full game in 5 years. All 3 pointers now and can’t touch guys. Lebron legit ruined NBA for me, Rich Paul is also a complete clown. Had to get prime Anthony Davis for another fake ring. Still hasn’t won a real ring yet rofl."
Can probably say the same for Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis literally won a Championship like a year ago.
"I'd like to see this supposed Boston trade, as the Pelicans got an absolute haul for Anthony Davis' contract.  &amp;#x200B;  I can't think of many more loaded deals than that one. It's not the Lakers fault that the Pelicans just lost Ball for nothing."
"Again the guy was plenty good enough to be the third best player on the team, you obviously can't find stats to deny that or you'd provide them. Have a good night. Anthony Davis can never be the number one on a good team and is a fantastic number 2. Best Robin in the league."
What stat do you want to use? Any you sort by basically have the guy as a top 60 player in the league that year which is plenty good for your third best player. Again if Anthony Davis was a top ten guy he would've had a winning record.
"While I absolutely hate Rich Paul for how he treats his less tier clients primarily Nerlens Noel.   I honestly don't have any issues with players trying to force trades to the teams they want to go to.   Like Sports teams don't have any sense of loyalty. It's hey what can you do for me now if you can't do anything for me the good bye.   While Charles Barkley complains about Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis, look at what the Kings did with DeMarcus Cousins. Look at what Clippers did Blake Griffin. Look at Boston did with Isaiah Thomas.   Isaiah Thomas was headed towards getting at least $15-25 mil per contract with how well he was doing in Boston. And his teammates liked him too. Then Danny Ainge cold heartedly shipped him off to Cleveland and dude didn't help with Cleveland and lost out on a big extension.   So yeah I don't really mind players forcing their way to their chosen team if they have the ability too."
"Except that Anthony Davis had to go to the league to force the Pelicans to actually let him play, so your example is completely incorrect."
Another big factor is Anthony Davis Sr. publicly criticised how bad then-GM Danny Ainge treated Celtics players (e.g IT4) so he was clear that he didn’t want his son to be traded to the Celtics
"Don't you think that was because he was playing next to LeBron though? Previous year he had randle who just got his squad into the playoffs, and holiday who was a big 3 on the champions, yet they had a losing record with Anthony Davis that year. He's proven that he can only get his team to a lower seed by himself if that."
he wasn’t good enough to replace all-star anthony davis
"But that's really all AD did. He didn't say ""if you trade me to Boston I won't show up"", he just said he'd play that year there and then sign where he wanted the next summer as a free agent. In fact, [this is the exact quote Rich Paul gave to Sports Illustrated about that:](https://www.si.com/.amp/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)  &gt; ”If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020. I’ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don’t blame Rich Paul.”  See? Free agency. That pretty much kills your narrative doesn't it? FWIW he said that no matter who traded for him he would not sign an extension and would instead become a free agent in 2020 and that's exactly what happened. He opted out of the last year of his contract in November and signed a new contract with the Lakers. Boston could have traded for him and he would have played for y'all, and maybe you'd have finally won a championship, but he would have left in free agency. Might have been worth it though, ask Raptor fans."
how the fuck the NBA let LeBron have Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook
Steph Curry Seth Curry Cade Cunningham Ed Davis Anthony Davis
Anthony Davis is less injury prone than Kawhi  Neither is that durable but AD is if you look at the numbers through the years
"I never mentioned the age of anyone in this post. I said the amassing of talent is what I believe will likely lead to healthy DNPs for the stars for Brooklyn and LA.   I'm not saying the Lakers are going to throw caution to the wind and disregard the regular season especially if the standings are close, but if you believe they won't rest Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, and LeBron James on occasion, especially after the injured playoffs all three went through then I don't know what to tell you, friend."
"Because they don't want to go there. His Dad, Anthony Davis Sr. blasted the Celts for what they did to Isaiah Thomas.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2818840-anthony-davis-father-rips-celtics-for-no-loyalty-with-isaiah-thomas"
"i understand that, i was referring to this specific part of chuck’s rant:  &gt;they had better deals from Boston for Anthony Davis, and I think maybe even New York, and they’re like, ‘No, he’s gonna go to L.A. and play with LeBron.  i’m just not sure it’s actually true NOLA got a worse deal from LA than they would have gotten from Boston or New York."
"2001. Anthony Mason, Antonio Davis, Theo Ratliff"
&gt;he just got to play with arguably the best player he’s ever played with in Jrue Holiday  Are you on crack? Kris Middleton literally made all star teams while Jrue has 0.   &gt;If Giannis had Rich Paul as his agent he probably would’ve left Milwaukee years ago.  Give me one Klutch player that has forced a move that isn't named Anthony Davis.  &gt;AD couldn’t get the job done so he gets a free pass to LA to play with one of the GOATs?  Yeah fuck him for not winning a championship with Jrue Holiday and the 2018 version of Julius Randle.
"Again with this.   Barkley BULLIED his way out of Philly and onto a contender.  Anthony Davis was going to be a free agent. He had already decided what team he wanted to play for. He didn't want to wait, so he let his team know his plans and allowed them to make a trade so they could get something back in return rather than losing him for nothing.   It allowed the team to make long-term plans and get a (GREAT) return on him.   What is fucking wrong with that?   As a Raptors and Pistons fan who has seen Allan Houston, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, and Chris Bosh all wait until free agency to reveal their plans, I can say, I would have PREFERRED getting the Anthony Davis treatment to all that (though Grant Hill did allow Detroit to work a sign-and-trade that landed up Ben Wallace).   And Barkley did the same thing himself as a player.   Can this guy shut the fuck up about this shit already?   And if it is the Ben Simmons thing, well... it's the Philly coach who came out to publicly criticize Simmons. That's on their front office for how they handled it.  I don't blame anybody there, but the Ben Simmons trade drama is more on Morey than Simmons."
It's not even really Rich Paul all that much nowadays. Ethan Sherwood Strauss had a great article on his substack the other day about Klutch and how it has changed.  https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/this-is-how-klutch-wins  Agents will do what they need to do to get their clients where they need to be. The ethical line is something that we all believe should be adhered to but not everybody follows the same principles. Rich Paul refusing to inform Nerlens Noel about contract offers where he could have earned generational wealth is negligence. Rich Paul limiting the market when it comes to Anthony Davis is a different story altogether.
"&gt; “I don’t believe that,” said Barkley. “You know how that group works. They try to trade their players to where they want to. They do it the way they want to. Anthony Davis – they had better deals from Boston for Anthony Davis, and I think maybe even New York, and they’re like, ‘No, he’s gonna go to L.A. and play with LeBron. He’s not gonna play.’ They just bully the league. At some point, a team or the league got to stand up to, ‘Wait a minute. I paid your guy. You can’t bully me to trade him and me taking some trash back.’ So I’m hoping somebody in the Sixers organization got some stones.”  That's the crux of his complaint. Barkley doesn't like stars forcing teams to trade them to one destination."
not if they got anthony davis lol
"In this modern era, your franchise's developmental program is nowhere near top 3. You sign a lot of guys that are already established and do away with your young talent. A lot of other franchises have that player that they can say they developed into something big. The Jazz has Donovan Mitchell. The Hawks have Trae Young. The Celtics have Jayson Tatum. The Heat have Bam Adebayo. The Pelicans had Anthony Davis and has Zion. The only guy I can see potentially fit that bill for y'all is THT, but only if you keep him."
"Mo Pete, Antonio Davis, Mike James, JYD, Charlie V, Alvin Williams, Damon Stoudemire, Anthony Parker, Jose Calderon, all in the raps hall of really good IMO"
"In a trade that makes zero sense for Philly, the Lakers send Russell Westbrook and practically no first round picks because New Orleans got them when we traded for Anthony Davis.  Philly would also need to send more players or cash because the salaries don't match. Russ makes $11 mil more than Ben this season."

"On any given play a player could be anyone of the three,also this pretty much only happens during half court situations,because positions definitely don’t matter during transition.  If Jokic sets up in the high post,he’s a post player at that point in time,if he gets a rebound and brings it down the court,he’s a ball handler(I’ll add that ball handler isn’t a great term,because if the reasons you pointed out,a better term would be initiator). If Jokic for some reason spots up in the corner,like if a transition opportunity breaks down and if he finds himself open in the corner,he would be a wing. Also most of the time Jokic operates in the post,whether that’s the high post or out of a screen and move set.  Other examples of players that fit into all three are KD,LeBron,Kobe,and a lot of others.  Many of the all time greats can do all of them,because that’s what makes them all time greats.  Also an easy way of finding out what they would be referred to as(like if it were to replace the 1-5 classifications) in my weird way of positions:  Point Guard:99% of the time would be a ball handler/initiator  Shooting Guard:either a ball handler or a wing. James Harden and CJ McCollum are ball handlers,Klay Thompson is a wing  Small Forward:Could feasibly be all of them,like KD and LeBron  Power forward:Wing or post,Marcus Morris is a wing,Anthony Davis is a post player  Center:99% of the time would be classified as a post player"
"There’s just as many superstar big men that get their own. Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Jokic are all superstar bigs. Then you have Gobert who is one of the best defenders and leads the league by a HUGE margin of advanced metrics like defensive raptor.   But yeah Mj would definitely adapt."
"I'm just not gonna like.. go through the list of superstars that were out these playoffs with injury (and who was eliminated as a result of that) and then be like ""oh yeah but Donte"" after looking at Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Trae Young, etc. Just a dishonest comparison. The reason the dude says ""a starter"" instead of Donte is because everyone knows where Donte is and saying ""a starter"" sounds more important."
Who is this Anthony Davis guy?      I’m a lakers fan but I don’t remember seeing him last year
"lonzo, i hated his ugly ass hair and rat face when he was on the lakers but now he doesnt have that haircut anymore so i dont hate him as much.  here are some players i currently hate:  kelly oubre  kyle kuzma  pj tucker   tyler herro  jalen green    here are some i dislike:  devin booker  anthony davis   shai although i dont want to   danny green  james harden   frank jackson   mpj  kristaps   ben simmons"
Hell nah. The spacing is atrocious. The only way they win games is with Anthony Davis abusing a teams shitty big men.
Khawi Anthony Davis Ben Simmons embiid giannis lebron   But it be interesting to see
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn’t playing well."
"He has less playoff appearances but he also has only 1 time this hasn't occured in 2014  2013- Lost to Spurs in 6 (2nd round)  2014- Lost to Clippers in 7 (1st round and the exception)  2015-2019- Made the finals   2020-2021- Missed playoffs  Edit: Also I think Anthony Davis has had this every time because he's only lost to the Warriors in the playoffs before the Lakers, and he's only lost to the Suns who made the finals or won the finals. Again, less playoff appearances but still interesting"
2022 Finals Potentially crushes all  PG Kyrie Irving  SG James Harden  SF LeBron James  PF Kevin Durant  C Anthony Davis  SF PF can go either way
"That wouldn't make sense though. Jazz would sooner put Royce O'Neal or Rudy Gay on Davis and let AD light them up for 36/10/5 than cede a huge scoring advantage to Lebron and Russ. There's very little you can do to slow down Anthony Davis and Lebron James, so you used the same strategy the Bucks used on KD this year and numerous teams used on Harden on the Rockets: make the stars work hard for their points, and focus on locking down the less reliable and more containable supporting cast."
"&gt; Bron, Nunn, Baze, Ariza, and AD  Lol you do not want to run a lineup of Nunn, Bazemore, and Ariza simultaneously in a playoff series against a legit opponent.   &gt; The Lakers are fine with AD shooting 3s  No they're not lol. An Anthony Davis three is a win for any defence. He's not a good shooter."
Did Anthony Davis retire?
LMAOOOOOO mf really put Anthony Davis on the bench in favor of prime RONDO??? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Anthony Davis*
"No it’s Anthony Davis. More blocks, more steals, more altered shots and passing lanes, and better defensive IQ."
Is it just me or is Ray Allen way higher than he should be?  I think it's blasphemy that he's ahead of Payton and Anthony Davis.
"&gt; Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  I feel like a lot of these comments are made with so much confidence but when has this strategy worked?  We've seen plenty of instances where teams have put on this brave face and then bailed early because the trade value doesn't rise but it does sometimes drop even further.   We can look at Anthony Davis, James Harden and Jimmy Butler as examples where holding out didn't net a better return. We can also look at role players like Eric Bledsoe in Phoenix or Kevin Porter Jr in Cleveland.   Disgruntled players just don't sell for top dollar.   ***  In addition, the trade deadline is historically a buyer's market.

"Ben Simmons vs. the Sixers: An inside look at a messy NBA divorce   by Keith Pompey  At what point do the 76ers give up and end the Ben Simmons saga?  Under normal circumstances, it would benefit the team to hold onto its disgruntled player until his trade value rises.  If this were the case for the Sixers, a great time to unload Simmons would be after Dec. 15, the first day this summer’s newly-signed free agents can be traded. That timeframe provides a bigger pool of potential trade partners.  A league source said the Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs are still inquiring about Simmons’ availability. Advertisement  But for now Simmons remains with Philly — and is being punished for missing time. The Sixers withheld $8.25 million of his salary Friday and placed the payment in an escrow account, sources confirmed. His contract is structured for him to receive 50% of this season’s $33 million salary by Oct. 1.  However, a source expects Simmons to receive all of the money owed to him. The belief is whichever team that acquires him is going to waive the fines the Sixers put in place.  » READ MORE: Joel Embiid on Ben Simmons’ absence: It’s ‘borderline kind of disrespectful’  The Sixers’ position that they’re not going to trade Simmons just to make a trade has been consistent. They’re trying to win a championship, and believe they’re in a better position to win one with him on the roster. Advertisement  But it is unprecedented for a maximum salary player who’s in the second year of a five-year extension to hold out and plan to never play for his franchise again.  Over the past couple of days, The Inquirer spoke with several sources, on the condition of anonymity, to get a better sense of why the 25-year-old would rather sit out a season instead of donning a Sixers uniform, again.  From the start, the Sixers and Simmons never felt like a perfect fit. Despite being a first-overall pick, this team was never really his squad. Some sources close to Simmons thought that became more apparent after the team hired Daryl Morey as president of basketball operations in November.  Morey was hired by the Sixers in November of 2020, in a move many anticipated would lead to the team acquiring James Harden from the Houston Rockets via a trade for Simmons. From the time the former Rockets general manager took over, Simmons believed his days in a Sixers uniform were numbered. Advertisement  The Inquirer also learned the Sixers weren’t as blindsided by Simmons’ desire to be traded as one would think. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, informed general manager Elton Brand of Simmons’ trade wish around three days after the team was eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. He then informed Morey shortly after that.  As a result, some in Simmons’ camp don’t believe the Sixers really expected him to return this season. One source, pointing out how the Sixers attempted to trade Simmons twice, said the team clearly wants to trade him. The source said they’re just determined to do it on their terms.

The problem is Simmons wants no parts of the franchise. Simmons believes the relationship with the team and All-Star teammate Joel Embiid has “run its course.”  “They know that,” a source said. “They’ve been known that. It doesn’t matter whether Ben shows up here today or two weeks from now. He’s going to be in street clothes, and you are not going to get the same Ben Simmons. So you might as well move on.” Advertisement  A source acknowledged that Simmons has to become a better player. Simmons can’t blame the Sixers for his history of passing up wide-open perimeter shots. Nor can he blame them for not developing his game in four NBA seasons. And he definitely can’t blame them for his 34.2% shooting from the foul line this past postseason.  “But that doesn’t negate that the relationship is done,” another source said. “This is just a life thing. Sometimes in life, relationships come to a head. That’s what this is. It just happened to be in sports. In the event that Ben does show up here, it’s not going to be in uniform. Just get rid of this guy, please.”  » READ MORE: Doc Rivers considers Ben Simmons domino effects, including changes to the Sixers’ starting lineup and defensive scheme  What could pose a problem for Simmons moving on is the Sixers’ tendency to overvalue him. They want potential trade partners to view Simmons as a three-time All-Star, two-time All-Defensive first-teamer, Defensive Player of the Year runner-up, 2020 steals champion, and 2018 Rookie of the Year. Advertisement  Instead, other teams see a player who passed up a wide-open, potential game-tying dunk with 3 minutes, 30 seconds remaining in Game 7 of the conference semifinals series against the Hawks. They see a guy who routinely struggles in the postseason and is perceived to be more in love with the NBA lifestyle than the game.  Even if the general view of Simmons’ skills was more lovely, it’s hard to imagine any team would give into the Sixers’ lofty demands.  Sources believe the Sixers were asking for too much while waiting to see if Portland Trail Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard or Washington Wizards All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal would become available. One source said Paul attempted to help the Sixers get five players back via a three-team trade. However, that died because of Philly’s steep demands.  Right now, as the Sixers wait out the storm, Simmons is being portrayed as someone who isn’t honoring his $177 million extension, a guy who quit on his teammates, and an individual whose skin is too thin to play in Philadelphia.  “This entire situation is not about Ben Simmons and the fans of Philly,” a source said. “It’s not about Ben Simmons being able to overcome the loss to the Hawks. It’s not any of that, and they know that. What is this? This is the relationship running its course. …. It’s never been smooth at all.”  Simmons has four years and $146.6 million remaining on the five-year extension he signed on July 16, 2019. But recent history is on his side as multiple All-Stars have forced trades in recent years.  Harden (Houston Rockets), Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs), Jimmy Butler (Minnesota Timberwolves), Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans), and Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) all got their wishes to move granted. In each of those cases, the player’s former team got worse. That’s something the Sixers are hoping to avoid with Embiid in his prime.  Multiple sources see this team as Embiid’s squad, not Simmons’ team. They feel it has been the way since Simmons sat out his rookie campaign in 2016-17  with a broken foot. At that point, Embiid, who averaged 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in just 31 games played in 2016-17, established himself as the team’s go-to player.  “What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged. “I’m just [speaking] facts. But because he’s Australian, because he’s a nice kid, got a nice family, he never said boo. He never complained.”"
"Regular season games missed in the last five years and respective ages:  * Anthony Davis - 83 games missed, 28 years old  * Kawhi Leonard - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * Steph Curry - 115 games missed, 34 years old  * Joel Embiid - 131 games missed , 27 years old  * Kevin Durant - 147 games missed, 33 years old"
"idk if you read his comment but coming out of college he was one of the most hyped #1 unanimous picks i can remember. i only started following basketball around 2012 but like that guy said people were making lebron comparisons. he was definitely in that anthony davis, zion tier of prospect. i dont think people expected him to cap out at 2nd team all nba cause he cant shoot"
"He was hurt in the finals games and played through it.   Until then, he was rivaling LeBron in chatter for playoffs mvp (ie.

"Brackets like that are used to clarify something which otherwise wouldn't have been clear with the original quote. In this case he probably said ""AD"" so the reporter changed that to ""[Anthony Davis]"" so readers would know who he was referring to."
"[Yep, this was just 10 months ago:](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30424042/dennis-schroder-says-intends-start-point-guard-los-angeles-lakers)  &gt; ""I did this off-the-bench stuff already in two years with OKC,"" Schroder, who finished second behind teammate Montrezl Harrell for Sixth Man of the Year for his role with the Thunder, said on an introductory videoconference call with reporters Monday. ""I think I try to move forward, and I think with [Anthony Davis] and LeBron, I can be helpful as a starter in the PG position.""  &gt; Schroder said that he has not spoken to Lakers coach Frank Vogel about his desire to start, however his representatives, Alex Saratsis and Jeff Austin of Octagon, discussed that aspect with the Lakers front office prior to L.A.'s trading guard Danny Green and the No. 28 pick in the draft to the Thunder to complete the deal.  &gt; ""I think my agent talked to the organization before they was trading me,"" he said ""So, that's that.""  I guess the selfish approach didn't work towards getting himself paid so now he's willing to try being a team player and see if that works."
"Rich Paul had to go complain to the league and the league threatened to fine the Pelicans.  &gt;Two days before the deadline, Rich Paul, Davis' agent, called the league office and expressed concern that the Pelicans wouldn't play Davis if he weren't traded, sources told ESPN. Paul told the league that Davis wanted to play.  &gt;...  &gt;The league referred the Pelicans to rules put in place in 2017 that restrict teams from resting healthy players. The Pelicans, league sources said, were told that they would be subject to a fine of $100,000 per every game if Davis were benched.

"He has Hassan Whiteside syndrome. People equate the size of his contract with how skilled he is, as if he was just not supposed to sign the contract that would change the entire trajectory of his family for generations because deep down he knew he wasn't as good as Anthony Davis. Drummond (and Hassan) are both still very good NBA players. Starters even! Are they top 10 big men in the NBA? No. But it's not really their fault they get paid too much."
I might agree with you here. I've recently learned he wanted to trade Ben Simmons for Anthony Davis after Ben was unable to play due to a night of hard partying.
" There’s a lot of misremembering that happens with that season, so this is a clear outline of the timeline of events.   The Celtics started 2018-19 10-10, which I think most people remember. There wasn’t really locker room turmoil at that point tho, at least not publicly. They just weren’t playing well.   Then, from Thanksgiving weekend through around mid-February, the Celtics were essentially the best team in the NBA. They went 25-9 and had a killer average point differential.   Now, despite the winning, there were some eyebrow-raising moments during the 25-9 stretch. For example, the Celtics had a disastrous road trip to Florida in mid-January, which included the infamous moment where Kyrie got mad at Gordon Hayward for not passing him the ball for the final shot in a loss to the Orlando Magic.   That was dismissed immediately tho because the first game back in Boston the Celtics won a huge game vs the Raptors and Kyrie held up the portion of his jersey to the Boston crowd after hitting a big shot, as seen here: https://i.imgur.com/fFM9vgD.jpg  What I didn’t anticipate at the time was that 12 days after that big Raptors win, Anthony Davis requested a trade. At the time, Kyrie was nursing an injury (in reality they were playing a couple crappy teams and Kyrie liked to sit those games out that year) so he was unavailable in the days following Davis’ trade request.   Speculation escalated towards the trade deadline, and it was the first time I heard any real indication that Kyrie might be leaving. Finally, four days after Davis’ request, Kyrie played again so he had to speak to the media. It was a pretty crappy interview and I remember thinking that was the first time I felt he might actually leave.   After that day, Kyrie only contributed to one more win in the 25-9 stretch, and on February 7, 10 days after Davis’ trade request and 6 days after the bad interview, the Celtics lost to the Lakers. That was the first game in a stretch of the final 28 games of the season, where the Celtics went 14-14. *That’s* when the turmoil, and the increasing acceptance that Kyrie wasn’t coming back, really took shape. Things never recovered and here we are.   So to recap, the day Anthony Davis requested a trade, the Celtics were in the middle of playing their best basketball of the season. And despite a few hiccups, things generally were going ok and the fans felt good about Kyrie. So most Celtics fans felt like a Kyrie and Davis connection in Boston was plausible at that moment.   However, it was that moment that flipped the season. Speculation about Kyrie began at that point, and soon after the losing started. This is what people remember about that season."
I'd be a fan. But I'm not the one who has to deal with the NBA front office and whatever else over that. IIRC the Pelicans were going to do that with Anthony Davis and the NBA intervened and made them play him.
"The most shocking thing about the story of Ainge offering 4 first rounders on draft night for Winslow was that Riley said ""no"".   I don't think anyone thought Winslow's career would turn out like this, but it's not like Riley was holding the #1 pick and about to draft Anthony Davis. How do you say ""no"" to that offer for the #10 pick?  Winslow, assuming he can get healthy, should still have at least a few more years. Maybe he turns out around. But man, he was really really bad last year."
&gt;  if Paul George played with LeBron for a decade  No one in NBA history has had better teammates than lebron and he's still only 4-6 in the finals  HALL-OF-FAME TEAMMATES  LeBron:  * Dwyane Wade * Chris Bosh * Ray Allen * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Russell Westbrook * Carmelo Anthony * Derrick Rose * Ben Wallace * Shaquille O'Neal  Jordan:  * Pippen * Rodman * Kukoc * Parish
Anthony Davis himself will require serious monitoring throughout the season. Might as well bubble wrap him and bust him out in February.
"There’s no reason to be scared at this point. That’s not a valid excuse. Lebron, Damian lillard, Steph curry, Anthony Davis all took the vaccine. 184 million people have taken the vaccine so far. Any sensible Doctor will recommend them taking the vaccine. I’m worried that they are sending a bad message to young fans and influencing people into not taking the vaccine. Testing does nothing to help with reaching herd immunity and finally getting past this pandemic. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. If they don’t want to take a vaccine they just can’t be employed by the nba. Which is a private business protecting their old coaches and staff. They got through a whole season but there were some many precautions taken and players still got COVID about 63 players last year got Covid in the league. So I don’t know where you’re getting information that they were “fine”  Listen you thinking that reading fake information online from Twitter or Facebook makes you know more than an actually health professionals is just ridiculous."
Breaking: Jayson Tatum Says The MeToo Movement Not As Important As Anthony Davis

"The funniest thing that happened in that whole proceeding was when he was asked to identify people in a picture, [he couldn’t remember Anthony Davis’s name. ](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/08/17/aging-pelicans-owner-couldnt-remember-anthony-davis-name-in-deposition/). Most people took this more as a sign that he didn’t give a fuck about the pels, not any sort of Alzheimer’s."
This is why Anthony Davis is a far better player..  Stop eating cheeseburgers 20 minutes before tip off man. AD came into last season slightly out of shape and looks like a new man this year. Change up your diet and you won’t have to be afraid to step on the scale.
2018 Kyrie was pretty insane before he got injured also Loves Min Offense would out shadow Anthony Davis defense imo
Anthony Davis or Trae Young
"not gonna lie, when it said ""James and Anthony"" my mind filled in Davis, not Carmelo, and I was like ""the author knows they've played 2 seasons and won a title, right?""  either way, of course Melo and LBJ will complement each other well...it's LeBron!!"
"any lineup with anthony davis at center is going to have good defense, especially when they have a defensive minded coach at the head of it all"
Anthony Davis shooting 33/34% from 3 and shooting deep fades stretches the floor right?
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
"&gt; 3 team deals with players of this magnitude rarely happen  I don't agree with that, I think it's about as common when dealing superstars for it to be more than 2 teams.  In recent years when a superstar was traded, Harden was 3 teams, Anthony Davis was 3 teams,  Kawhi was 2 teams."
"Harden is an insanely elite and since ball movement is what you're going for, why wouldn't you start Harden at the two? Is Anthony Davis a better pure defender and lob threat than Dwight? AD can play outside too but I think having 4 out makes more sense with the amount of shooting you'd have with Harden too."
Anthony Davis
&gt; lookin like an Anthony Davis cosplayer  The absolute disrespect to Seth Curry
"No you don't get it, Anthony Davis is a true saint for saying he got vaccinated for selfish reasons and not going one step further to promote public health!"
I expected more than 1 lob to Anthony Davis in a season because non point guards can do that

"Their most important player is 36 years old with an extensive injury history. They just enjoyed a playoff run where they dodged Anthony Davis for most of round 1, Jamal Murray in round 2, and Kawhi Leonard in the WCF. And all their young players are about to become very expensive."

"Its not small markets with a disadvantage, lots of big city teams like Dallas, Philly, Houston, Chicago, and Toronto didn't get him either.  I have to speak up whenever I hear this slander because people always want to call out ""big market"" teams and when pressed, they'll backtrack and move the goalposts.  Chicago is never in these discussions despite being #4 in size in the NBA.  Its because they've sucked for so long with little to show for it.  Terrible GM, terrible owner, terrible rotating list of coaches since MJ left.  Toronto is also a team that isn't in many free agent destinations, partly because its in Canada, but you'd think its size and the fact that it represents an entire country would boost its stock more.  Did you know San Antonio is a #8 in the list of NBA team city sizes?  And its got a great GM and coach and a great culture in a state with no income tax, how come they don't get many looks?  Or if you want to talk metro area, Washington and Atlanta are right up there as some of the biggest in the NBA.  Its not about ""big market"" vs. ""small market"", that's just an easy lie cooked up by the owners as an excuse not to pay guys.  Its about team legacy, that's part of it.  Its about how ownership treats players in the long-term.  Its about location, cause nobody wants to go home to a frozen mansion in Minnesota in December.  Its about willingness to spend.    Look at the list above, what team legacy can modern players get out of playing in Philly, Houston, or Chicago?  The last time they won was decades ago.  You know how I know that?  KD specifically [called out the Knicks](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-offers-reason-why-knicks-dont-land-key-free-agents-they-are-not-as-cool-to-younger-players-right-now/) for trying to play to their legacy in free agency in 2019:  &gt; ""They're trying. They're trying,"" Durant said. ""It's hard to get the best players to play here. It's hard ... I think a lot of fans look at the Knicks as a brand and expect these younger players who, in their lifetime, don't remember the Knicks being good. I didn't grow up with the Knicks. I've seen the Knicks in the Finals, but kids coming up after me didn't see that. So that whole brand of the Knicks to them is not as cool as, let's say, the Golden State Warriors or even the Lakers or the Nets now.  Sure the Lakers sucked, but they also have a very recent history of winning just 9 years before Lebron showed up.  They also treated their superstars very well, from giving Kobe his legacy $50m contract before they even knew the extent of his injury, to trading Shaq to where he wanted to go back when he had a breakup.  Lebron knew his legacy would be secured putting it in the hands of the Lakers, unlike if he went to Chicago who had a terrible front office for over a decade.  Chicago's ""Garpax"" was in charge from 2009-2020, with Paxon being the GM before that from 2003.  Does anything in that run suggest keeping the same people in charge for over a decade?  Jeannie Buss fired *her own brother* in a bid to improve the Lakers!  You can bet that would resonate with players who want to win.  And speaking of large contracts, did you know one reason Paul George left Indiana was because they [claimed poverty](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/06/23/paul-george-says-he-left-pacers-after-they-refused-to-add-best-pf-reportedly-anthony-davis/) and wouldn't go after Anthony Davis?    &gt; ""I ain’t going to say the names, because I’m going to keep their business private. I’m just going to say it like this: I had, at the time, the best power forward saying he wanted to come to Indy and team up with me.""  &gt; ""They’re like, “We’re a mid-major. We’re a small market. We can’t do it. We’re a small market. We can’t afford that.” I’m like, “The best power forward wants to come play here. Y’all can’t make that work?” They didn’t want to do it.""  &gt; ""So, I’m like – now, I’m pissed. Because it’s like, what am I doing here? You know what I mean? They don’t to win. I’ve got the best power forward that want to come play here. Not everybody chooses Indy to come play at. This dude wanted to come play here. They didn’t want to do it.""  In case you didn't know, the Pacers are owned by a conglomerate of billionaires.  The main guy Herb Simon is worth $3.2 billion himself, and co-owner Jim Morris is also a billionaire.  You know who's not a billionaire?  Jeannie Buss, who has a 1/6th share of the Lakers family ownership of 66%, making her worth ""only"" about $500m, one of the poorest NBA owners.  You know what she's not afraid to do though?  Spend to acquire free agents, because she's in the basketball business for basketball and some of the other guys are in it for just the money.    It is not about big markets, or big money.  Lebron came to the Lakers because a lot of bad teams had bad *histories* and nobody had faith they were going to improve.  The Lakers were bold, they made big moves that didn't pan out, but they weren't afraid to make them.  Compare them to a team like Dallas who did win recently and is in a big city and you would be fair in asking yourself why not them?  But I'd argue Dallas' biggest move was drafting Dirk, which is a matter of luck, not skill.  Cuban broke apart the championship team by being cheap, and it was only because Vlade made the bonehead draft move of this generation that Luka fell into Cuban's lap.  Otherwise, Dallas would still be a rebuilding team 8 years after their last championship with no end in sight.  Houston almost made it, but they broke apart their team again, for money, and then made one panic trade after another.  Plus Lebron wasn't going to be owned by a Trump fan like Fritata.    Lest you think this is all about the Lakers, even we've had our embarrassments.  Kevin Durant didn't even give us a meeting either before he went to Golden State.  Why would he?  At that time, our owners were embroiled in a family drama and our aging superstar was waiting out the years until he retired, we were going nowhere and he knew it.  Why did he go to Golden State if its all about the big markets like you said?  San Francisco is a mid-sized NBA team in both city and metro size.  However, it is easy to see why he went there: they're good.  It matched up with KD's desire to immediately win, not build something in a place like OKC.  Just like Giannis stayed because he was a guy who shunned the big city limelights, smaller markets get their wins too.  Everybody wants to talk about Lebron because he's the biggest name in the NBA, but you forget that Charlotte got Hayward, Minnesota lost Butler because one of their max stars was lazy, Indiana lost PG not because they are small but because they are cheap, and the Knicks haven't gotten any free agents of note for 20 years except Melo who was coming home, and maybe Amare on the downside of his career.  Lots of small markets keep their guys because they are good and will spend, which attracts other free agents, which in turn builds a legacy and a culture that makes players want to go there.  The Lakers have been doing it for 30 years non-stop with a blip due to health issues, that's why we got Lebron, and that's why we got AD.  Other big markets can't boast that.  Neither can small markets, but you never hear its the Lakers vs. everybody else, its always a way for fans to demonize big markets.  Just stop, your team is bad because it makes terrible decisions"
