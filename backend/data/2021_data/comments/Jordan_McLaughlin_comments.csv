"Oh man, this is not worse than the g-league squad we were rolling out last year.  Napier, Okogie, Kelan Martin, Treveon Graham, Jordan Bell, Culver, McLaughlin, Bates-Diop  I’ve definitely enjoyed watching Beasley, DLO, Vando, and Mcdaniels"
"Yeah, I think they had some hope without KAT they would at least have decent guard play and they don't have that.  Rough season for Rubio and D'Lo.  Jordan McLaughlin also probably should get minutes on merit, but he has too highly paid, underperforming players ahead of him."
"Damn that is tough to see. Doubt it’s rigged though, four points is close enough to give it a play if they miss both. But it does suck like literally I lost a four leg multi the other day cause Jordan McLaughlin tipped in a shot with 1.3 seconds left even though the were down 12 to the warriors - still hate the bastard."
Well there is 5 starters and 5*30 is 150 which leaves 100 then you get your good bench players out of the way (a lot of these guys being mentioned are in my 175-200 range which is above average considering the whole league)then the next tier will get you to most average.  I’ll mention some other guys I have in the same range  Josh Jackson Langston Galloway Troy Brown Jr Grayson Allen Cole Anthony Jordan McLaughlin Onyeka Okongwu Naz Reid Brad Wanamaker  Prob take Cole and Onyeka our due to potential but any of those other guys could make a case
KAT is still in covid protocol and DLo injured his quad. Agreed that wolves need them badly. I’m a Rubio fan but recently he’s been outplayed by our two-way PG Jordan McLaughlin.
I love Jordan McLaughlin and I do care who knows.  I need everybody to know.
Talent exists though and the guys at the top are almost always the most talented as well as some of the hardest workers out there. Someone like a Jordan McLaughlin could still be the hardest worker but that doesn’t give him the physical attributes and IQ of LeBron or the ungodly coordination of the Steph Curry. These guys have special abilities that can’t just be developed by any old regular person
"&gt;Its entirely possible the hardest worker in the nba is Jordan mclaughlin  I would disagree and strongly at that.  Across just about every discipline, in all walks of life, it is observed that the highest achievers combine natural ability with incredibly hard work.  Among NBA players, given that they are already the elite of the elite, you will find very hard workers. It is almost impossible that the hardest worker among them would be a bench player.  It is most likely Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant or one of the other greats. It is why they are who they are."
Well Jordan Mclaughlin is like 4'8 and can dunk so he must have put in the work at some time
"Those guys are out there, no one reports on them though.  Which leads to this false idea among fans that the best players are the best because they watch the most film, or work the hardest.  Its entirely possible the hardest worker in the nba is Jordan mclaughlin"
"Yeah his back ups are/were Ricky Rubio, Jordan McLaughlin, Ky Bowman, Jordan Poole and Alec Burks and dspite that the offenses were better with those guys on the floor and Dlo on the bench, surely a sad coincidence"
Remember the shit we were saying about Culver last year? We would have dubbed him Jordan Michael Jordan Mclaughlin if he was putting up these numbers.

"Aside from the just the dividing the pie logic, would it not water down the product even further? There are so many meaningless games in the NBA... random teams like the Wolves become black holes where players you kinda remember from college end up toiling in obscurity, playing meaningless games against other black hole teams like Orlando or the Wizards.   The NBA thrives on starpower... good players playing against each other as often as possible, which is why the playoffs are so amazing. Except for the primetime matchups, regular season NBA basketball is often hard to watch... especially with 48 minute games meaning that the best players only play 2/3 of the game, so you gotta watch dudes like Ish Smith play big chunks of games against dudes like Jordan McLaughlin. It just isn’t a great product... more teams means more Ish Smith’s vs. more Jordan McLaughlin’s more often.   Maybe more teams means more teams with Cap space and the stars get spread out, but I kind of doubt that happens. Stars will still cluster together. Maybe the ticket sales, merchandise, and TV deals will offset the further watering down of the product. I’m not business person, but I am skeptical of risking hurting the existing product (which by some accounts is already lacking and hurting ratings) in exchange for adding new markets.  PS I’ve been musing for a while about how much better the NBA on-court product would be if it was like 20 teams instead of 30, and all this speculation about adding teams compelled me to try to coalesce some of those thoughts lol."
"I don't see how DLo is a fringe all star. I didn't see it last year, either. What is it that you all see in him? The offense looks better with Jordan Mclaughlin. Hell, he even plays better defense, too.  He has literally not been one of the best 5 or 6 players on this team. And this team blows so hard."
Tbh I think Jordan McLaughlin about to take his job anyway
"That's a funny way of saying Ricky Rubio, Anthony Edwards, Josh Okogie, Jarret Culver, Ed Davis, Jaylen Nowell, Malik Beasley, Naz Reid, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jaden McDaniels, Jake Layman, Jordan McLaughlin, and Jaun Hernangomez are 1-11. It's a team game, feel free to name all the players contributing to our loses next time!"
Jordan McLaughlin
"I think Jordan McLaughlin is underrated, even by your own FO. Has the tools to be the perfect backup PG but is languishing in the G-League and no one knows who he is."
I didn't think DJ Augustin would be this shitty but I did want Jordan McLaughlin over him. He's probably better right now and like 8 years younger. Would be much happier if McLaughlin was on the Bucks right now.
It’s Jordan “24/11 on his first start” McLaughlin and Pascal “inefficient volume scorer on a max” siakam we’re talking about actually. Soon to be Jordan “nba champion” McLaughlin and pascal “worst contract in the nba” siakam in 2-3 years too.
"is that jordan ""5 ppg"" mclaughlin and pascal ""21 ppg"" siakam you're talking about?"
"More like .93, and siakam will continue to be raps Wiggins while Jordan McLaughlin wins finals mvp. Cant wait for the raptors to be irrelevant again while wolves are contenders like it’s 2003 again."
"Saunders had a lot of faults as a coach, but his one redeeming strength was letting young guys have a fair shot at earning their roles.   He took Beasley from an off and on rotation guy and unleashed a beast on the league. He took Naz Ried and Jordan McLaughlin off of our G-League roster and made them serviceable backups in the NBA. He let McDaniels and Vanderbuilt from being DNP players at the beginning of the season and they are the 2 main guys holding down our PF position.   Not saying that Saunders is responsible for all their development but his ability to find diamonds in the rough and let them earn their minutes has been big for our roster building. If Thibs was still here, we would have traded future assets for players on the tail end of their careers."
Imagine being Jordan McLaughlin right now and watching Rubio do this shit from the bench
JORDAN MCLAUGHLIN IS THE CLUTCHEST PLAYER IN NBA HISTORY!
Jordan McLaughlin
"KAT, DLo, Naz Reid, Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Anthony Edwards, Jarred Vanderbilt and Jordan McLaughlin  That would leave out: Rubio, Culver, Okogie, Hernangomez, Nowell, Layman, Davis  I would hope then that Rubio and Hernangomez get picked up"
But who’s guarding Jordan McLaughlin?
"yeah man, it's been tough sledding for you guys. i hope KAT comes back soon, he's such a unique talent. at the very least, you guys can at least unearth some hidden gems on the roster that can be a part of the future. Antman is a stud and Naz looks like a keeper for sure. Love Jordan McLaughlin as a backup guard  also fire saunders ASAP"
Jordan McLaughlin is going to cook him in practice
"He has had every chance he needs and continued to fail. I’ve never seen a player struggle so much with consistent play due to lack of confidence. Add to that a broken shot and you end up where we are now.  He couldn’t get minutes on a “shitty” wolves team so what makes you think he’ll magically get run on a deeper Grizzlies roster?  It wasn’t a Wolves thing, it was a Culver thing. We’ve had guys continue to grow who were taken far later in Jaden, Nowell, Naz Reid, and Jordan McLaughlin. Hell even Edwards showed development. And miss me with the “he was a #1 pick of course he’s good!” Like completely forget that his class was dumped on for a year as one of the worst of all time, bust potential in the top 3, no guarantee, etc."
"Jayden McDaniels, Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, and Naz Reid tell a different story.   Four players who’ve developed to be better than Culver has been playing. If Culver still has a higher ceiling than those four, it’s no longer the Wolves fault he’s not playing better than any of them."
"We, the Wolves, certainly haven't. It's more a product of our minimal cap space but we made a lateral move healthy for depth across the roster and hope to resign our &lt;7$$ per year role guys (who can be legitimately impactful at times). Not a lot of upside in terms of creative roster building, as our assets seem kinda mismatched in regards to the guys it would make sense to bring in to our roster.   The upside is even our fringe rotational guys have a fair amount of upside going into the season. Jaylen Nowell, Jordan McLaughlin, Jarred  Vanderbilt, (Nathan Knight?), Juancho Hernangomez are all guys that could credibly play better next year than last. How much better is unknown. I personally believe Malik Beasley's play will make GMs reassess his value more highly. Also we're still just riding the high of Anthony Edwards, so life could be worse."
Warriors:  \+Justinian Jessop (2020 2nd round pick)  \+Jaquori McLaughlin (E10 contract)  \- Jordan Schakel (Plays for Kings? summerleague now)
"Can they use it to extend JTA's contract? The only other options I see are using it on an international player or overpay a RFA like Jordan McLaughlin (they need another PG...). None of these contracts are final, so they could also try poking at a guy like Malik Monk, who may have more of a diminished role than he initially thought when signing with the Lakers (though I think this would have long term consequences for future dealings)."
Jordan McLaughlin calling it now
Big Mac for Jaden McDaniels. Because we already have Jordan McLaughlin on the roster who we refered to as JMac already. So Jaden became Big Mag and Jordan Lil Mac.
"I honestly think pure, open cap space is a better option. Or a trade for Rubio/Bev/Smart/Jordan McLaughlin. Replacing Devonte’ with Schroder would be such a step backward for our ball movement, we don’t need to have an inefficient Terry to pair with our efficient Terry."
Jordan McLaughlin is ashamed he didn’t make this list
I hope teams are doing the same shit right back. “Yeah best I could do is jordan McLaughlin and a 2nd rounder”
Jordan McLaughlin isn't a RFA
"For some perspective, this is what the roster of the Iowa Wolves, a team with the worst record in the G-league last season, consisted of:  -Zylan Cheatham- 1st team all pac 12  -Canyon Barry- SEC 6th Man of the Year  -Jordan McLaughlin- 1st team all pac 12  -Jordan Murphy- 1st team all big 10  -Allonzo Trier- 1st team all pac 12  -Isiah Briscoe- Averaged 12/5/4 while being a starter for an Elite 8 Kentucky team  Heres the Salt Lake City Stars, the 2nd worst team in the G-League last season:  -Trevon Blueitt: consensus all-American in college  -Jarrell Brantley- 1st team all-CAA  -Trent Forrest- 2nd team all-ACC  -Trevon Scott- 1st team all-AAC, AAC DPOY  -Malcolm Miller- 2nd team all-Patriot League  And these guys have all gotten better with years of training and experience since they earned these college accolades.   The top couple of guys in college are better than the top couple of guys in the G-league but top-to-bottom it just doesnt compare. You aint getting to the G-League if you arent a pretty damn good college player"
Jordan mclaughlin said he cuts himself on his back for every turnover he makes
I like Jordan McLaughlin a lot but he's a back up for sure. An incredible back up
"i'd love to see d'lo and dinwiddie play together again, but we really don't need morw guards tbh.  we have d'lo, rubio, beasley, ant, jaylen nowell, jordan mclaughlin, and then leandro bolmaro seems like he's coming over from barca for next season"
**Staying tier:**  KAT  D'lo   Ant   Jaden McDaniels   Naz Reid   **Maybe tier:**  Malik Beasley  Josh Okogie  Jarred Vanderbilt  Jaylen Nowell  Juancho Hernangomez  **Leaving tier:**  Rubio  Culver  Jake Layman  Ed Davis  Jordan McLaughlin
"I was very surprised to see no one offered him a 10 day. Maybe it’s because of his age but idk 32 isn’t that old if you ask me, especially since he was playing pretty efficiently in the G League during a season where NBA players were getting injured left and right. I mean was Jordan McLaughlin really the better choice for backup pg while D’Lo was injured?  Honestly, he only had one bad year and it was the year he was coming back from a major injury. I think the NBA may have shut the door on him a little too quickly, but with Lin that’s always been par for the course sadly."
"You almost have to throw the advanced numbers out when evaluating this Wolves team due to injuries and the resulting lineups it resulted in.   KAT missed 22 games. Russell missed 30. Beasley missed 35. That sometimes meant guys like Ant had to play alongside some BAD teammates in some BAD lineups. This was especially apparent early (when KAT missed time), when Ant was coming off the bench. There were tons of games where Ant was asked to lead a second unit of Jordan McLaughlin-Josh Okogie-Jarred Vanderbilt-Naz Reid. That meant he was either jacking up contested 3s or driving into a jam-packed paint. There were numerous games where he was something like 4-18 and it wasn’t because he was just jacking shots. The Wolves before the break were PAINFUL (they had the worst record in the entire league for a reason). Because Edwards didn’t miss any time and was there for all of those god ugly days, he’s naturally going to have a gnarly set of advanced statistics."
"Can’t defend the adultery. HOWEVER, I can’t help but feel the same people who are complaining about a ‘toxic’ environment are the same people who were complaining about how Thibs ran things. Guess what? Your franchise has sucked for basically its entire existence. People are going to come in and try and change things. But because Glen Taylor runs the team like it’s a fucking Dairy Queen, Fred and Fannie in marketing get to bitch and moan about how they’re being pushed too hard and actually get listened to.  Also, the Jordan McLaughlin complaint is hilarious. Rosas is supposed to turn down a Pat Bev trade because it might hurt McLaughlin’s feelings? Get all the way out of here"
"the only one that could arguably start for the Sixers would be Malik, 33 year old Pat Bev is not getting the start over Maxey or Curry, neither is Jordan McLaughlin, or even Josh Okogie.  Idk how you think you have 3-4 starting caliber guards on your team excluding Ant and Dlo.  Like you understand by definition any team can only start 2, maybe 3 guards if you get funky with it anyway right?"
"Jordan Mf'in Mclaughlin.  Standing at a towering 5'11, the fearless jordan mclaughlin finds himself at home and in his element at the target center in minneapolis minnesota. Vicious, Jmac packs a bite much bigger than his frame. Watch him in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMxR6IRxI2w). A stealthy, intelligent predator who hides in plain sight picking off passing lanes and laying in wait to dunk on unsuspecting \~7 footers."
"He played most if not all of his minutes as the SG next to Jordan Mclaughlin and Rubio, which is something that Ryan Saunders couldn't of figured out even on accident"
Jordan McLaughlin and Jaylen Nowell
"I mean just scanning through the wolves roster since I'm a wolves fan, you've got okogie, edwards and maybe Jordan mclaughlin and Jake Layman who I could see being good football players.   Guys like Culver *maybe* could get there with a lot of 'reshaping"" of his body, but even then thats a stretch"
Yogi Ferrell is pretty high up there  I guess Jordan McLaughlin and other scrubby pgs are there too  It doesnt mean it's shit

Rosas. Turned RoCo into Beasley and the Nets pick which he turned into Bolmaro and Jaden McDaniels. Found Jordan McLaughlin and Naz Reid in the scrapyard.   The only blemish on his tenure was heading into this season without a real PF and drafting Culver.
"I just think the two way contract/restricted free agency system is so rough that I can't blame him for taking the guaranteed money this year. Like Danuel House was able to squeeze Morey and the Rockets a couple years ago because they needed him for the playoffs, but for the Thunder if Brown doesn't take the deal they could just leave him flapping in the breeze and give him a qualifying offer for peanuts in the offseason. And since the Thunder could just match any reasonable offer, he might not get a better deal in the offseason, like what happened to Jordan McLaughlin last offseason. I don't know that he ever got offered a deal from the Wolves but I think other teams didn't want to because they thought Minnesota might match so now he's stuck on the two way again."
"But choose to bandwagon the Minneapolis Lakers flair...  Compared to the mess the roster was in when he got here Rosas has done an excellent job and the only glaring mistakes were heading into the season with no starting PF and drafting Culver in 2019 (he can still pan out but its unlikely and he made up for that mistake with Jaylen Nowell,Naz Reid,Jordan McLaughlin and Jaden McDaniels).   Another thing you can blame on him was Ryan but Glenn clearly chose the signing there."
Jordan McLaughlin for the Wolves is pretty good.
They knew they could resign Jordan McLaughlin at or around the minimum and also had Jaylen Nowell on a 2-way so they had guard options.
Fat Jordan McLaughlin gives me backup center vibes
"Jordan McLaughlin is the only one I can think of for the Timberwolves. Normally we have DLo, Malik, or KAT that we might drag if they’re doing asscheeks but so far this season the most consistent one is Jordan"
"there’s been a lot of DLO haters the last couple years, but people are starting to come around.  mfers haaaaaaaated Juancho Hernangomez last year and that was well deserved lol.  Right now things are going good and there’s very little hate, but people recognize that Jordan Mclaughlin is a bit of weak link out there. Smart backup point guard that makes good decisions so hard to hate him but he just doesn’t do much out there, and the resentment is starting to build as the team as always does a bit worse with him on the court"
"Jordan McLaughlin our 3rd string PG. Hasn't gotten too many minutes this year and seems to have fallen into a role of injury insurance. He's actually quite a bit better than this when he gets minutes and rythym, but he's gotta learn to scale down his role"
Jimmy already took the L to our third stringers in early 2020. Jordan McLaughlin cooked him for the game winner
"If I remember correctly, Jordan Mclaughlin took Leonard off the dribble to the rack, from the right AND left side. Truly a fever dream of a game."

"In the 3rd quarter, Paul George decided to go for layup. Our hero, Jordan McLaughlin decided that even though he was outclassed, to block PG. and he managed to get an entire hand on the ball.  The shot still went in"
yeah tbh ben simmons prolly isn't even worth jaden mcdaniels like jordan mclaughlin and a 2028 second is prolly the limit with this much talent on the wolves roster
"3 things I took away from this game.  1. The Wolves offense is a self-inflicted mess. They force a ton of bad shots early in the shot clock for no real reason, it also usually comes when they have the momentum, which is why the Wolves have had so much trouble closing out teams. As much as I love Ant, he’s been one of the biggest perpetrators of this. I know that he can explode at any minute, but he needs to recognize that we don’t need him to go nuclear all the time, in games where we have the lead there’s no real reason to force an off the dribble 3 5 seconds into the shot clock. Finch needs to get ahold on this because Ant isn’t the only one and it has plagued us throughout the start of this season.  2. In a game where Jordan McLaughlin was absolutely cooked and highlighted just how much we need Pat Bev and Dlo, Taurean Prince was still by far the worst player on the court. His shot isn’t falling, his defense is exposed by any player who has a semblance of athleticism, and the amount of miscommunications he has with a teammate that leads to a turnover is startlingly high for this early in the season. The +/- stats in this game now are a bit skewed because of the Magic’s late 4th quarter surge but when this game was close in the 3rd he was like a -15 or something.  3. The Wolves will probably be alright, they missed a ton of open looks tonight (and this season) that will start falling eventually, but for a team that is a fringe playoff contender losses like these will come back to hurt you later on in the season. Credit to the magic who played great (especially Cole and Franz) but Wolves were up 13 in the middle of the third quarter and should’ve won this game. Finch needs to get a hold of this team because this is multiple games now where we’ve thrown away a lead due to sloppy and erratic play."
"One extremely shrewd but under-the-radar target would have been Jordan Mclaughlin. He’s been buried on the roster with the Wolves, but I think he could be a really good backup PG somewhere.   He’s tiny, but he’s got a ton of bounce (he postered Clint Capela in a game a few seasons ago), is a great ballhandler, solid shooter (36.5% from 3 in his career), he plays with effort on defense (though he’s limited there by his size), and he’s extremely safe with the ball.   As a PG, he’s super aggressive in getting the ball moved around, plays with a TON of pace. Every time he’s in as the primary ballhandler, it’s a shot in the arm to the offense. He may just be too small to play significant minutes in the NBA, but he’s got a ton of attributes you want in a backup PG. IIRC, he was been on two-way contracts his first two seasons and inked a 3 year/ $6 mil deal right before the season started this year."
"&gt; He can set up his own shot and is decent from 3 but cant create for others.  I mean, you're basically describing Jordan Clarkson who just won 6MOTY.   And Jamal Crawford, who won it multiple times. And LouWill, with the one exception of he could setup Trez, but no one else ever.   If CHI wanted a non-scoring floor general, they could've just signed Jordan McLaughlin or something."
"I was pissed when we picked him. I wanted Coby White. We had 2 years hearing about how much of a work ethic he had. But seemed to do him no good. No improvement at all over the 2 years.  You can go ""lolwolves"" over it but we turned Naz Reid, Jaylen Nowell and Jordan McLaughlin into legit rotational pieces in the same time period. Dude just straight up sucked"
I’d probably give up Jordan McLaughlin for him.
"I'm not sure he is, some of his best work last season was when Finch came in and started working him off the ball more. Physically, he's not that explosive and he doesn't have an insane handle.  He might be more comfortable with the ball in his hands, but he might be more efficient working off ball off of screens and kickouts.   But with Rubio gone, the only other true playmaker on the roster is probably Jordan McLaughlin, so that might be where the 2/3 1/3 breakdown comes in as McLaughlin will probably see 15 to 18 minutes per game at most. The rest of the time, they're going to need Russell to run the offense."
three teamer with minnesota so they can finally get beasley and jordan mclaughlin
"I mean  KAT, Beasley, and DLo all missed major games throughout the season. At times we had Jordan McLaughlin running point too.   We were a bad offense due to ALL of our best players missing time.   ANT was our only good player on offense who didn’t miss time."
I thought JMac was Jordan McLaughlin.
"Fine, we'll settle for Jalen Suggs. He'd fit on our team extremely well considering we have:  Jaden McDaniels,Jaylen Nowell,Jordan McLaughlin,Juancho Hernangomez,Jake Layman,Josh Okogie,Jarret Culver and Jarred Vanderbilt"
"Yea, no shame in losing against us when we have the goated Jordan McLaughlin"
"Then proceeded to pick Nowell in the second round who's a nice rotational piece, Naz Reid, to an extremely team-friendly contract and Jordan Mclaughlin, a solid pg off the bench. Then comes back the next year and hits on Ant and Mcdaniels who have played huge minutes this year as rookies. I think he's doing a pretty good job personally."
"Right, in BKN he has ball handlers along side him in Dinwiddie and Levert. We’ve tried that with Rubio and guys like Jordan McLaughlin, Jaylen Nowell, but they all have huge limitations so it’s never been perfect. It could definitely work with the right pairing."
