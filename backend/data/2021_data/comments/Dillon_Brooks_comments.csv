Dillon Brooks maybe? Idk decent kinda has a large range. Decent could mean okay or pretty damn good.
"this grizz defense has been nuts the last two games, dillon brooks can get all the hate but his effort on defense has been phenomenal he basically starts all the havoc on defense. My man has no off switch for every shot he bricks he makes it up by going 200% on defense"
Memphis is an easy team to root for.  Also they're extremely loaded in backcourt depth it's kind of bonkers.  PG: Ja / Tyus Jones  SG: Dillon Brooks / DeAnthony Melton / Grayson Allen  SF: Kyle Anderson / Desmond Bane / John Konchar  They basically have so many shooting guards that they're slotting the bigger ones in the wing slot. And remember they still have Justise Winslow.  I could see them consolidating their depth for another good wing in the future.
"I have Kyle Anderson, JJJ, Valanciunas, Clarke, Jones, and Dillon Brooks on my fantasy team."
"And Dillon Brooks is the most inefficient scorer ever  Got him on my fantasy team, but he really should be losing minutes to the solid bench guards/wings they have"
"good coaching , high iq but on the lower end in terms of athleticism and talent roster, + Ja morant.  Dillon brooks horrible IQ balances everything out btw"
Where's the fan that called Dillon Brooks Fat Danny Green last game? Because now I can't unsee it.  D:
"I'd like to see how these were calculated. Dillon Brooks being a worse defender than Luke Kennard seems a bit off. I wonder if it does not account for who they are guarding, as Kennard is often given easier players to guard and Brooks is usually guards one of the best players on the opposing team."
"Can we talk about how Demar DeRozan backed down Dillon Brooks and scored, then shoved Ja and talked shit to DB, getting a tech.  And then he proceeded *not to score again the entire game* lmao."
I really liked him when he was at Oregon with Dillon Brooks
"Luka for Dillon Brooks, straight up"
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
Dillon Brooks
May I offer you Dillon Brooks in these trying times?
"but think of the marketing/branding opportunities with Beale/Beal Street!   Dillon Brooks, Gorgui Dieng, a signed marko guduric jersey, a top 29 protected second round pick, and we‚Äôll name one of the ducks at the peabody Agent 0  but in all seriousness, can we please get one league leading scorer please without giving up ja or jjj üôè"
Dillon Brooksüòë
He probly won't but Kings should've traded him for at least a future 2nd round pick. Guys they could've drafted besides Giles:  Terrence Ferguson Jarrett Allen OG Anunoby Kuzma Derrick White Josh Hart Thomas Bryant Dillon Brooks
"Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks are both home runs outside the lottery (and they moved up for Clarke), and this year Desmond Bane and X Tillman (and they moved up for both, I believe). Also Konchar."
"Really appreciate the thoughtful response!  The part of him having poor selection is what I‚Äôm most concerned about.   Once mediocre young guys get that level of freedom, they‚Äôre hard to reign in once their squad gets better.... see: Dion Waiters, Louis Williams, et al.   I sincerely hope he has a good career but it‚Äôs becoming increasingly evident that only the NBA‚Äôs top-end talent can play like Dillon Brooks and have their team also be successful."
So happy to not see Dillon Brooks on the main graphic.
"Pick the Grizzlies bruv, one of our mods is bri'ish. We also have two people from your commonwealth of Canada in Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks. Jaren Jackson Jr is also very fashionable like royalty."
How about Dillon Brooks?
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"Also it's not like his college career was shabby by any means. That U of O Ducks team that made it to the Final Four and lost to eventual champs North Carolina by a point had a helluva squad. If Boucher wasn't injured I'm pretty confident they would've made it to the championship game at least. That team also had Jordan Bell (who sadly flamed out after that 1st chip got to his head), Dillon Brooks, and the Celtic's favorite rookie Payton Pritchard.  They weren't bad the previous year either, losing to Oklahoma in the Elite Eight when Buddy Hield looked like the second coming of Steph Curry.  Those were the best Ducks basketball squads in recent history."
Same with Dillon Brooks. Sometimes just making them need to use that little bit of extra mental/physical energy on getting down the floor can make a difference
"Grizzlies Comment Submission: Once again, pundits underrated Memphis and we find ourselves over-performing and in contention for a playoff spot. Memphis somehow won 4 games while Ja and JJJ were both out and where the primary offensive option was Dillon Brooks (Halloween comes early this year). Rookie Xavier Tillman is making a splash and looks like a poor man's Draymond. He has the best plus/minus of any qualifying rookie, and appears to be yet another excellent pick by GM Zach Kleiman. Memphis is playing better defense this year compared to last year, and are in the top 10 in DRTG. They are also number 2 in the league in paint points. But last in the league in FTA per game. Take that for data."
Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks ate his lunch defensively
Dillon Brooks was putting in work
"As big of a meme he is for Grizzlies fans, Dillon Brooks covering Booker made this a win.  Yes im ignoring he shot 1-10 too"
Booker‚Äôs Dillon brooks impersonation was spot on tonight
Dillon Brooks neutralizing his streaky offense with clamp defense on Book
Lmao wtf is Dillon Brooks doing leaving Bridges wide open in the corner?! Give up the 2 if you have to now a wide open 3 ball lol. I swear the dude might have the lowest bball IQ in the fucking league. So bad.
The gap between Dillon Brooks' confidence level and actual skill level is so wide that i respect it.
"I‚Äôve never liked Dillon Brooks but not bc of anything w basketball. just bc u can tell he thinks he‚Äôs SO fucking good, he just seems like he‚Äôd b mad annoying irl"
Are there Grizzlies fan that still like Dillon Brooks. Every time I see a game with him he looks selfish and innefficient.
Dillon Brooks is the most delusionaly confident shooter I‚Äôve ever see
Bro Dillon Brooks the only reason i dont want to watch Grizzly but luckily that outweight by Ja fun play lmao.
Great example of Dillon Brooks being a selfish motherfucker. Ja is injured and Brooks is going 1 on 4 while the rest of the team is calling timeout and that mother fucker still got a shot off
Dillon Brooks is so damn bad. He‚Äôs like unathletic JR Smith
Has anyone seen Dillon Brooks and Danny Green in the same room?
"Dillon brooks is much watch tv, how someone like him can take some of the shots he takes is next level basketball"
"I'm waiting for people to turn on Ja too at any moment tbh. He's uber confident in himself. The ""tell that motherfucker about me"" and all the flexing was only endearing to everyone cause he was a flashy rookie, sub would have a meltdown if someone else did that. Plus we have Dillon Brooks too who is already hated by certain fan bases."
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Dillon Brooks thinks he‚Äôs prime Kobe vs everyone
Dillon Brooks also seems to ball out against the suns too..
this made me laugh and grimace in about equal measure because it's both remarkably accurate and hilarious but on the other hand it made me think about dillon brooks
"I saw someone sum up Brooks pretty perfectly with  &gt; ""It's Dillon Brooks time""  &gt; - Dillon Brooks"
Dillon Brooks without question. I cried the day of his contract extension.
"Easily Dillon Brooks. Had like the lowest FG% and lowest PPG of anyone with 15fga last year, iirc  There was a play in the bubble against Portland where he had 3 defenders on him with like 10 sec on the shot and Grayson Allen (who shot 50% from 3 in bubble) was wide open in the corner. And he shot like a 35 fter"
Bruh i remember grizzlies fans tellin me grayson allen+ Dillon Brooks for zach üíÄ
Not when Dillon Brooks is playing more than ten minutes.
Ben would rather pass to a Howard 3 than try to score on Dillon Brooks tonight
"Levert isn‚Äôt all that great. There are so many of him in the league. Empty calorie mid-range jump shooters that are just average from three, don‚Äôt get to the rim, and don‚Äôt play defense. Jeremy Lamb, Rudy Gay, Will Barton, Evan Fournier, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, Malik Beasley, etc, etc."
Is this about the Dillon Brooks/Marshon Brooks debacle?

"Man he'd be a perfect fit next to Ja and JJJ  I think the best we could give em would be Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, and a bunch of picks which probably isn't gonna scratch that itch."
Dillon Brooks will morph into Prime Jordan against us and might well win the Grizz the game lol
Full strength Wolves lineup against a Memphis side without Ja and JJJ so we should really be winning this.  But we're the Wolves. And the Grizzlies have Dillon Brooks  So naturally Brooks will put up 40 and we'll lose
This is pretty recent but Dillon fucking Brooks

[Dillon Brooks taunted Lebron](https://streamable.com/i0vw50) so he took it personally.
"Poor Dillon Brooks, dude was just trying his hardest LeBron just decided he was gonna score that possession so you can't really stop him."
He did it cuz Dillon Brooks is from Sauga. LeBron hates the GTA.
Lmao dillon brooks is so annoying this was satisfying
I‚Äôm not even a Memphis fan but Dillon Brooks is like the most hair tearing ridiculous chucker I‚Äôve seen in a long time. I get that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúscorer‚Äù but Jesus you don‚Äôt have to put one up EVERY time you touch the ball.
Dillon Brooks is really committed to that Count of Monte Christo look
I remember last year when Dillon Brooks first started talking with the Iggy situation and the Grizzlies fans were like that's our guy.   *Fast forward a year and a half*  Grizzlies Fans: Please shut up Dillon.
"Dillon Brooks has to have some dirt on the Memphis front office, dude is actually not good at all"
Lmao said this in the third   &gt;Dillon Brooks is just the right level of annoying to get Lebron actually trying and interrupt LeCoast.
"lakers decided to just win, also doesn't help that dillon brooks is the kind of annoying lebron hates"
"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had had, or will, need to talk about Dillon Brooks"
"Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, and Dillon Brooks all have negative wingspans"
"r/nba is weird  I submitted this originally and said ""Dillon Brooks pushed LeBron""   People commented saying it wasn't a push so I figured, I should delete it and title it correctly  So I do and now it's being received worse than the original   Like I don't really care that much but what do yall want lmao"
Dillon Brooks is just the right level of annoying to get Lebron actually trying and interrupt LeCoast.
"I totally get that it‚Äôs bad defense. Hell, Dillon brooks is the worst about commuting stupid fouls Trae played him like a fiddle. It‚Äôs just not fun to watch the baiting and whining aspect of it. If I had a dollar every time Luka jerked his head back when he didn‚Äôt get touched on the head/face, I‚Äôd be rich."

I hate Dillon Brooks for the sole purpose that he is a Tyranasaurus Rex with those short ass arms. He has a negative wingspan and it‚Äôs so obvious when you see him on TV. It annoys the fuck out of me. Like why do you have your arms so short? Get out of the NBA
"I think they actually will do something about that 'stopping so the defender runs into you' thing that he's been doing. Similar to how they made kicking your leg out on a jump shot an offensive foul a few years ago.  Also, i feel like people need to realize the difference between foul baiting and flopping. What Trae is doing is annoying, but it's not flopping. He's exploiting the rules to make defenders foul him whereas flopping would just be acting like he got fouled when the defender didn't even make any contact. Guys like Lowry, Smart, Dillon Brooks, Blake Griffin, etc are the worst floppers in the league. Trae, Harden, Jimmy Butler, etc are the worst foul baiters in the league, but there's a big difference in that the latter are actually drawing fouls even if they're exploiting the rules to do so."
"[Here](https://streamable.com/6aacsq) is a link to a shitty 3 clip combination of calls against the Grizz that made me pull my hair out.  The most dangerous thing here is not the two blatant offensive fouls on Dillon Brooks that ended in 6 free throws for Trae.  The second clip Ja really doesnt touch Trae. Like, at all. His hands are up and he stops moving because he knows Trae's trick. Trae doesnt even really embellish the contact, the ref just knows that this move by Trae is known to be foul so he puts air in the whistle!   I feel like the refs are all privvy to the little tricks of certain players and know what the rules need them to call so they dont take these fouls on a play-by-play basis."

"&gt; Nobody annoys Grizz fans more than Dillon Brooks  Not even Wallace, Parsons, or Bickerstaff?"
"No you wouldnt  Nobody annoys Grizz fans more than Dillon Brooks. Regardless of it is his awful shot selection, over-aggressive defense getting us in foul trouble, or just being annoyed at other Grizz fans complaining about the first 2 things constantly, he is the most frustrating Grizz player to the fans by a mile."
Yeah it was mostly slow-mo. Justise and Melton too at times. Dillon Brooks was out but he's usually the guy we throw on the other team's best wing.
"Memphis for Dillon Brooks, Gorgui Dieng, + 1st"
i didn‚Äôt watch but probably dillon brooks
Dillon Brooks
"Grizzlies payroll in general is pretty good. Next year, they should have around $10 million in cap space, and the only player on an expiring deal is Gorgui Dieng. In 2022/23, they'll have Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, Melton, Brandon Clarke, John Konchar, Desmond Bane, Jontay Porter, and Xavier Tillman signed. For a combined $45 million.   A lot of that unused cap space will probably be used to re-sign dudes like JJJ, Winslow, Tyus Jones, etc. But I feel like that's a pretty good group of players to have for relatively cheap."
What a Dillon Brooks game. Memphis needed to have the other shooter - Allen - stepping up but not even that.
Yesterday play made me so mad. He gets lost on defense on offense can't make basic passes he is a super sized dumber dillon brooks
"Without naming players in the Eastern conference or players with birthdays in March, and of course no European players, can you name 12 better clutch scorers than Dillon Brooks. I'll wait üò§"
Grayson Allen  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  The Morris twins
Pretty nice crew until you mention Dillon Brooks!
Y‚Äôall are missing NBA superstar Dillon brooks
"Yeah I agree Boston doesn't have the assets to make a workeable deal and I genuinely dont even think Boston wants such a heavy investment in the center position anyway. By all accounts, tehy are looking for another wing more than another C. But like if Memphis called offering like Jonas Valanciunas + Dillon Brooks + Kyle Anderson + 3 1sts (1 being Utah's, 1 being GSW) for Vuc + Fournier, I definitely think  Orlando should listen in that scenario."
"When I think of Chris Boucher, I cry.  A team with Payton Pritchard, Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, Tyler Dorsey and him would have won the national championship."
Dillon Brooks checking in
"Darius Bazley, Cam Reddish, and Dillon Brooks come to mind."
Dillon Brooks? Can any Grizz fans confirm?
Dillon Brooks he leads the team in field goal attempts but is the worst player on the team
"It‚Äôs the guys who drive their fanbases crazy because they do stupid shit. Usually bad shot selection and tunnel vision.      Drummond, Oubre, Dillon Brooks jump to mind. Sexton was pretty bad last year but I think Cavs fans say he has improved."
Dillon Brooks fa sho
"you could easily make a lowlight reel that looks more damning for quite a number of players, I mean part of OPs argument for how drummond is the ""worst high usage player in the league and its not even close"" includes the fact that he is in the 40th percentile for various offensive metrics which while not good seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what percentile means if that is the argument you are trying to make.     cursory look through drummond's bref page will show you that this has indeed been his worst season by a considerable margin and even still there isn't much of a statistical argument that he is the worst high usage offensive player in the league this year with the seasons westbrook, dillon brooks, coby white, and terrence ross are having."
"Grizzlies for Justise Winslow and Dillon Brooks. Getting rid of Brooks frees up more playing time for Bane. Winslow is a depreciating asset that probably wouldn't even find rotation time there.   Drummond can slip into that frontcourt rotation alongside JV, Clarke, Tillman and Dieng. They basically all average around 20-30 minutes each so they can shave off a few minutes from each other and give themselves a serious frontcourt nightmare for opposing teams that's extremely versatile and unpredictable in terms of permutations that you'd be facing."
In college Dillon Brooks(the guy he was guarding) did something similar vs Kyle Kuzma in college https://youtu.be/JaqGtuxfLbY
I swear it's Dillon brooks half the time hahaha
"Love that this was against Dillon Brooks, perpetrator of the worst flop of all time."
Hilarious that this was against Dillon Brooks who might be responsible for the most hilarious flop if all time.
Yeah I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why he flopped lmao but I guarantee the last thing going through Dillon Brooks‚Äô head in the shower postgame was ‚Äúwow why is everyone flopping vs me‚Äù
It's always against Dillon Brooks. Dude is LeFlop Whisperer
Oh lol. Dillon Brooks was provoking LeBron and then Bron said ‚Äúlet me guard him‚Äù and popped off.
You for real? You must have missed Dillon Brooks talking shit lmao.
Dillon Brooks is the flopper supreme
"I don't see how people haven't made the connection, but his two biggest flops are against Dillon Brooks. He only flopped last night because Brooks was on him. Make fun of LeBron all you want for how much he whines to the refs (he does this and it's annoying). But the man does not flop. Pretty pathetic that he does it once and gets a warning but guys like Embiid and Trae aren't reprimanded"

Nah atleast Brooks has some contact with Kuz.  Lebron fell backwards because Dillon Brooks was barely boxing him out lol
"not sure if I speak for others, but my good Dillon Brooks is so inconsistent and makes way too many mistakes for the NBA. Dude has total tunnel vision and plays hero ball way too much.   Examples of why he‚Äôs shitty  1. decided the fuck the shit out of Kansas in the elite 8 in 2017  2. For some reason is the number one option in the offense, so he‚Äôll get a lot of points but only because he shoots 8-25  3. Worst court vision on the Grizzlies, does not know where his defender is if he‚Äôs not looking straight at him  4. shoots 38% from the field. Not a horrible 3 point shooter but only when it‚Äôs a catch and shoot   5. talks SO much shit for no reason. Decided to talk shit to lebron for no reason and proceeded to turn the ball over 3 times in 5 possessions last night.   TLDR: dude thinks he‚Äôs a superstar and talks the talk but cannot finish through."
"Nah for Grizz fans, it‚Äôs gotta be Dillon Brooks"
Dillon Brooks or Eric Bledsoe
I think I hate Dillon brooks more than Lebron lmao
I think everyone hates Dillon Brooks
"No, Dillon Brooks hate lebron. Do you think Lebron thinks about Dillon Brooks at night? Its the other way around"
"Forreal. I noticed he been doing this on Dillon Brooks specifically, who is notorious for his flops too. But they all came out of hiding to shit on the King!"
You should look up Dillon Brooks flop in college (UO vs UTAH) . It‚Äôs so much worse than this and also quite hilarious!
Sometimes your gameplan of preserving the body for the long term goal has to be paused when bitch ass Dillon Brooks talks some shit   -LeBron probably
Dillon Brooks keeps winning games for the other team.
"According to Dillon Brooks, it's:  Dillon.  Dillon.  Dillon.  Dillon.  Dillon."
Dillon Brooks is gonna be featured in LeBron‚Äôs documentary as an example of how he motivated himself later in his career.
i was really confused why Dillon Brooks decided to double team Marc Gasol on the perimeter while guarding Lebron even though they didn‚Äôt make a 3 in the 2nd half until garbage time lol
I don't know why lakers fans waste so much energy on Dillon Brooks either...
"I wonder what Dillon Brooks said to LeBron in the second after he fouled him that got him fired up, lol."
I love when we play the Grizzlies. They always go up big on us then lose there lead and blame the refs Lmaoo.   Oh yeah Dillon Brooks is the biggest front runner in the NBA right now. He only does that hype/trash talk when his team is up 20. When the Lakers starting cutting down the lead he went quiet and we won.   **Frontrunner Dillon Brooks for you**
"I loved Kuzma's energy tonight. He continues to impress me with his improved decision making, rebounding, and defense. Grizzlies played excellent defense in the first half, especially Dillon Brooks. They were effective in clogging the paint and preventing the Lakers from getting easy looks inside."
LeBron hates Dillon Brooks so much lol
Dillon Brooks put on a clinic on how to not position yourself in space when running a zone
Legit idk what Dillon Brooks said to Lebron but he seems like he‚Äôs going at him pretty hard
Dillon Brooks is just a poor man‚Äôs Pat Bev. Trash
"Dillon Brooks was starting shit way earlier in the game, I haven‚Äôt seen him since his either 3rd or 4th foul so idk if he‚Äôs still chirping, would advise against it tho"
"Dillon Brooks saw honey Badger in the Super Bowl and thought ""let me try that"""
Lebron is so fucking hilarious. He really went to the griz bench just to talk shit to dillon brooks
What did Dillon Brooks say to LeBron? I missed it
LeBron has something against Dillon Brooks lol
Blame Dillon Brooks he started talking shit
Thank you Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks gonna be OUT THE LEAGUE before Lebron retires I swear to fucking god
 this all started when Dillon brooks flexed on Bron lol
Based on lakers game threads Dillon brooks shooting should draw fouls against the most disciplined defense. I think?
"Which gameplan will attract fouls?  - Dillon Brooks chucking from 3  - LeBron, AD, and Trez going hard in the paint"
Dillon Brooks. No worries man. I loved your confidence this game. üî• Always good to be hyped about your performance
GOAT SHIT SIT DOWN DILLON BROOKS BUM ASS
I swear his worst flops of the year comes with Dillon Brooks on him. Something about the dude brings out Heatles Bron lmao
Bron hates Dillon brooks lmaoo
Dillon Brooks talks so much shit for being a massive nobody in this league Lmfaooooo
Disrespectful for Dillon Brooks to wear 24.
We tried to trade Marshon Brooks for Oubre. the other team which i guess was the Wizards at the time thought we meant Dillon Brooks
Dillon and Marshon Brooks. Both were on Memphis
"Dillon Brooks shoots 35% for his career from three, Grayson Allen shoots 37%. What the fuck are you on about? Maybe the Lakers should close out better lol"
My life would be so different if I had the completely irrational confidence of Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks is a dog
"Grizz were already without Jaren and Winslow. Now they are also without Brandon Clarke and NET rating stud Deanthony Melton, as well as 3 other injuries (a total of 7 Grizzlies out tonight).  If the bad Dillon Brooks shows up, it will be another big L for the Grizz."
"Question for Grizz fans:  Does Brooks ever pass?  I know he had 2 assists tonight, but every time I watch Memphis, I see Dillon Brooks rolling in a chuckwagon.  Does he have the green light to chuck to his heart's content?"
Dillon Brooks has some real Kelly Oubre tendencies.
"Dillon Brooks shoots every time he gets the ball, ja shouldn‚Äôt be surprised lmao"
Because teams found out he wasn‚Äôt Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks looks like a chubby Danny Green
"&gt; That said idk how much I this helps Sacramento.  Dillon Brooks I think would be a decent fit for them at the 3, they get an extra 1st, and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be that much worse right now in the short term with Fox-Hali backcourt with Brooks as a 6th man than a Fox-Buddy backcourt with Hali as a 6th man"
"The problem that I have with this is some players jump forwards into the defenders area and get this call. And I understand that it looks bad if the shooter is landing on top of the defenders foot regardless. But if the defender is going straight up or even jumping toward the shooter and the shooter is jumping toward them idk how you can rule anything against the defender.  I say that knowing Dillon brooks benefited from this very situation in our recent game against the heat. And the heat, I think iguodala specifically benefited from this in the playoffs against the bucks last season. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense."
Dillon Brooks slept on
"I think they're a first round exit regardless of whether or not JJJ is healthy.  Huge amount of depth on the team, but I think they're one great wing away from true contention. This is all hypothetical, but if they could upgrade Dillon Brooks into someone like Paul George then that'd put them potentially above Portland and Dallas imo."

"It's crazy to me as an Oregon fan that on a team that featured Jordan Bell, Dillon Brooks, and Payton Pritchard, Chris Boucher has been the one making the biggest impact in the NBA."
"&gt;no one else in the league embodied the same level of ultracompetiveness, supreme confidence, leave it all on the floor, playing through injury as my man Kobe that I grew up idolizing in LA.  Dillon Brooks will carry on the mantle after Bestbrook retires"
Is it too mean to say that Dillon Brooks is the player Sean McDermott thinks he is?
"How good would a team.made up of just Canadians do?  Murray, Dort, Boucher, Birch, Wiggins, TT, Olynyk, Shai, RJ, Dillon Brooks,Brazdeikis,  Brandon Clarke, Nate Darling, CoJo, Powell, Mychal Mulder, NAW?"
"Grayson ""Dillon ""Michael Jordan"" Brooks"" Allen"
"Grizz have been an absolute wrecking crew against some of the top teams in the East lately. Last night and tonight were without JJJ and Winslow obviously, but also without De'Anthony Melton and Brandon Clarke, two of the Grizzlies' top pieces of the second unit. Some really impressive stretch finally to 3+ games above .500 for the first time since they were 9-6  Also Grayson Allen went absolutely bonkers tonight on top of Dillon Brooks looking fantastic and uncharacteristically unselfish"
Dillon Brooks look like that dude that wore a Cookie Monster hat and always asks where my hug at
Dillon Brooks deserves hate  Chad Brooks will restore this franchise to greatness.
"Memphis scouting is underrated. They got Dillon Brooks, Melton, Bane, Tillman, all from 2nd round picks."
When we play you everyone in the wolves sub is like how many points is Dillon brooks going to score against us tonight
Chad Dillon Brooks always seems to come to play against Minnesota.
Dillon brooks
"Memphis should petition *hard* to move to the East when the two expansion teams shake up the conference alignment.  4 games against Miami where you know Dillon Brooks is giving you the revenge tour special  ^(Also, Memphis is a home court advantage team in the East)"
"I don't see your point.   That GSW team was insanely stacked yes but Iggy was still an important part of it and the fact that he wasn't a 1 or 2 option there doesn't mean he should be in his own head and thinking about what Dillon Brooks thinks, which is the point of this thread and this post."

Dillon Brooks begs to disagree
Iggy‚Äôs 37 and was an important piece to a finals team I don‚Äôt believe he thinks about Dillon Brooks
Andre Iguodala: played in the finals last season  Dillon Brooks: didn‚Äôt
"""I know Iguodala's role isn't to match Dillon's stats but I thought it was worth noting that well-known shit talker Dillon Brooks backed this one up."" -OP"
"I thought Dillon Brooks was referring to their playoff run *last* season. But yeah, you do you."
[This is what Chad Dillon Brooks looks like and it is peak performance.](https://i.imgur.com/pyFhuDv.jpg)
Theres two versions of Brooks referred to by Grizz fans  Chad Brooks   And Dillon Brooks.  You want the first version
"Yeah +/- aside Dipo was okay for the most part. Had the quick burst that got him to the paint for a layup or a kick out, hit a couple of shots, was aggressive on the boards. People are saying he was chucking but most of his shots were within the flow of the offense. Still needs to brush up on the FT line (3/5 today) but tbh FT's was only good for Jimmy today.  What really killed us was giving up like 10 open threes and our switching defense getting exposed. Valenciunas had 15 in the 1st quarter because we kept switching smaller guys onto him. Dillon Brooks got hot after we gave him several open 3's prompting him to score contested shot after shot afterwards. Same with Anderson."
‚ÄúFine I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù  -Dillon Brooks
"God I hope Ja is okay.  What an insane third quarter from Dillon Brooks. I love this team, especially when we're sharing the ball and shooting well.  Really hoping we hold on to the 8th seed. With how the play in tourney works 7-8 basically get two chances at the 'yoffs."
Dillon Brooks hates Iggy
It‚Äôs Dillon Brooks and Slow-Mo season babbbbbbby!
Tonight Dillon Brooks is the player he thinks he is.
"Dillon Brooks is literally possessed by MJ, Lebron, and Steph Curry."
"I've only seen Memphis once, and it was preceded by the word quietly, but that's what we get for being a small market. Jaren Jackson Jr. is an absolute stud, as a rim protecting big that shoots 40% from three. Ja just won ROY. They were both top four picks? No problem! Dillon Brooks was a late second round pick, and we developed him into a two way stud, at least for where he was drafted (although he doesn't shoot the best %, he certainly isn't afraid to keep shooting... hopefully the % goes up). We traded for Melton, another second round pick, and he is getting minutes in the rotation, looking like a future 3nD contributor. BClarke had an incredible rookie year for us, and this year he is having another very good year. Bane is looking like a great value pick from the end of this past first round too. I'm not necessarily arguing that Memphis is better than someone like San Antonio or Toronto, but the organization knows how to both draft the right guys, and develop them properly."
Dillon Brooks is both one of my favorite and least favorite players to watch depending on the game.
Dillon Brooks doesn't have anything to redeem himself for.
&gt;bench players but he has problems with his skills and tendencies that make him not an optimal number #1 or 2.  Ahhh the Dillon Brooks special

Dillon Brooks would look great in a T-Wolves uniform.
"Ja, valanciunas, and Dillon Brooks I think have been more important/better  JJJ hopefully will be better too when he‚Äôs back but obvi he‚Äôs missed the whole season. Brooks and Anderson could be argued either way imo but when Brooks is having a good offensive game then he‚Äôs def better/more important."
I'd rank our healthy players like this  1) Chad Brooks  2) Ja Morant  3) JV  4) Dillon Brooks  People will shit on Ja but he's absolutely our best playmaker and offensive weapon.
dillon brooks is such a bitch.

"Canada: Only other country with an NBA team   Canadian players: SGA, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Lu Dort, Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, and a few others.

I've thought for a while that Memphis needs to consolidate their glut of shooting guards but still oof.  Also TIL Dillon Brooks is 6'7 damn
Does norm Powell at $20 mil move the needle enough for Memphis to want to do this. Idk maybe I guess. Nick nurse might also get fed up with Dillon Brooks Dillon Brooksness also

"Dillon Brooks is the ultimate record stabilizer player. If you're a below .500 team, he helps your team get to .500. If you're an above .500 team, he drags your team down towards .500"

"Didn't shai and naw grow up in TO but transfer out for High school? I know RJ and Dillon are from Sauga and Cory from Pickering but iirc all of them except Brooks were born in the dot. Olynyk is also from Toronto but moved to bc in middle school  Fun fact, cojo and olynyk were both on the same Scarborough Blues team that dominated the city  (low key my team got slapped up by 40) and one of their only losses came against the 5-0 who were led by Stephen Curry."
Pretty sure Dillon Brooks deflected it a bit.
"I hate how the game ended. First, let's be honest, that wasn't a foul. Ja had a rough game and was looking to draw contact instead of getting a clean shot up. He's normally killer with an off-glass floater right there, and I wish he had just focused on that. Can't help but wonder if having an off night got in his head and made him reluctant to shoot.    But mostly it's just a shame everyone is focused on a ref's arm going up instead of how awesome that game was. Grizzlies had a really terrible 3rd quarter, but other than that, both teams were playing with serious effort, looking to get to the rim, and not settling for bad jump shots. I think both teams played phenomenal defense. Nuggets absolutely fought the Grizzlies from getting to their normal sweet spots in the lane. Shut Ja down for the most part. Dillon Brooks pestered the shit out of Murray, and probably had a lot to do with his horrific shooting. Jokic is just a straight beast, and played out of his mind against Jonas, who deserves credit for his defensive effort none-the-less.     Hate that we lost, but it was a really quality game I thought."

"&gt; So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.  Size, strength, length, positional versatility.  &gt; For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  Did you notice all of these guys played on bad to pathetic defenses? Compared to Fournier being on a top 10 defense. There‚Äôs a difference between guarding elite players because your team is devoid of defensive talent and being the most important perimeter defender on a top 10 defense.   &gt; This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court.  Using individual drtg percentiles is doing my head in, I can‚Äôt think of why anyone would use that. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre using to look at these but I would hazard a guess just based on logic that centers, other big men, and bench players dominate the upper percentiles. Last season his drtg was 109.5, which would have been the 7th best defense in the league. So in the minutes he was on they performed as the 7 best defense in the league, which is even better than our overall 10th ranked defense."
"&gt;Based on their defensive skill sets.  So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.   &gt;In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier  Teams are going to hunt the weak defender like Tor and Mil did the past 2 postseasons. Having AD and LeBron to help helps alot(so did Jonathan Isaac in 2019) but your still introducing a weak link and area they can attack to begin with.   For reference [you can look up from 2014-20 how much any defender spent on the opponents no 1, no 2, no 3 option](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  &gt;we‚Äôve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years  Im on CTG looking at the Magic's defensive rating when Fournier has been on the court the past 2 yrs:   This yr: 29th percentile Last yr: 51st percentile  This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall.

"We have a big glut of guys in that 2/3 spot. Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and DeAnthony Melton are all fighting for minutes in that area. And each of them has shown that they deserve minutes.   It's one of the things this Grizz team has going for and also against it. We have a lot of good, but not great players. Ja and Jaren are our only 2 great players. The rest of the team is filled in with legitimately GOOD basketball players. But it's hard to find them all minutes. Like every team would love to have these guys, especially on their current salary, but they can only take us so far. So I'm hoping that we can either find one of these guys to be the 3rd star player, or we package a few of these guys and picks for another potentially great player.   I'm not sure how far it goes, but a package of Brandon Clarke, dealer's choice of Melton/Bane/Allen, salary filler, and 2 first round picks might be enough to get us someone else to be the dynamic wing we still need.   A starting lineup of Ja, Dillon Brooks, ""hypothetical traded for player"", JJJ, and Valanciunas/Xavier Tillman would be an excellent lineup for this team to go forward with."

"You're missing the Grizzlies, honestly.  They have a star point guard and very capable back-up PG in Morant and Tyus Jones.  As an OKC-Jazz fan, I envy their options at SG: two-way menace Dillon Brooks, sharpshooter Grayson Allen, advanced stats darling and defensive ace DeAnthony Melton, flamethrower-type of shooter Desmond Bane and John Konchar who is a lot better than people realize since he's buried down the depth chart (he could be a reliable regular back-up on some teams).  At small forward, they have options due to Justise Winslow (who's in a slump) and Kyle Anderson. But this is the only position where they could use more strength, even though Brooks, Konchar and Bane could play the position in a small-ball lineup.  Big man/PF rotation is something to envy: one of the most underrated centers in Valanciunas, potential star JJJ, Tillman, Clarke, even Jontay Porter is somewhat interesting as a prospect (would looove to have him on Jazz or OKC).  Honestly, hats off to their GM."

"&gt;That‚Äôs an excuse people use when they don‚Äôt actually watch the teams they are talking about. You literally mentioned nothing about the skill level of both players.   What excuse? I asked a direct question. Where is all this Westbrook ""clutchness"" when it really matters in the playoffs?  &gt;JV for one. Dillon Brooks has been good for them as well, Slow Mo, Bane and Allen both been really good. And the biggest issue is they are ninth in defense despite Ja not being a good defender.   I thought u said ""elite"" role players..    &gt; I know we aren‚Äôt comparing two years of Jamal Murray to the entirety of Westbrook‚Äôs playoff career. You can‚Äôt be serious, you can‚Äôt mention ‚Äúit‚Äôs just one one regular season‚Äù and then allude to one Jamal Murray bubble run. You just cant.   Of course I'm not talking about whole career but if we're talking about who's better right now I'm taking Murray. It's not even just the bubble run either...the Nuggets had a good playoff run in 19 as well.  &gt;From a basketball standpoint, Westbrook is better than Ja. He‚Äôs not efficient especially cause of the games with the injury now and he‚Äôs still a better scorer, playmaker, defender, and rebounder.  The only argument u can really make for Russell is statistics, but his statistics never actually amount to anything"

"Listen man, I don‚Äôt know if Dillon Brooks once called you a good guy in passing or something but you‚Äôre defending the dude who went 0/5 in the 4th when the game was close and didn‚Äôt give the ball up to anyone when he got touches. I legit think I might be arguing with a Dillon Brooks burner account at this point. You posted the stats like a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù when all they did was prove my point.  I get that Ja had an off night.

"&gt; Yeah and he still shot the Grizzlies out of the game. Nobody was taking great shots but if every time dude catches the ball he‚Äôs missing and taking away a possession, he‚Äôs shooting you out of the game.  Lmfao I just listed out how Dillon Brooks didn't shoot anyone of the game.   He literally shot 16 of Memphis' 22 points in the 3rd to keep them within 6 points from us midway through?   If anything, you should be saying WE shot them out of the game. Right up until the 4th when D Rose took over.  What were you watching bro?? Lol"
Dillon Brooks shot the Grizzlies out of the game.
I'm sure you have a valid opinion here because you're a Grizzlies fan so you watch way more Memphis games than us but this is kinda irrelevant.  Tony Brothers ejected your coach then gave Dillon Brooks a tech and then  ejected Morant all within the span of like 3 minutes.
Dillon Brooks and Desmond Bane were the only two that showed up tonight. Lol
Ja morant and whoever is the grizz coach got tossed. I think Dillon brooks got a tech as well?
"He‚Äôs clearly the best player on the Grizz, leads them in scoring and assists. Dillon Brooks? Really bro? Crazy recency bias, Ja‚Äôs just had a bad week.  The surrounding talent around Ja and Fox are similar, yet ones in the playoff race and one is 10 games below .500. If you actually think Ja and Darius Garland are on the same level then you‚Äôre underrating Ja."
Shit like this is why i ordered a Dillon Brooks City Edition lmao. What a fucking Chad
You still have Tyus and the corpse of Winslow. I legit don't know who the PG for the Pistons is.   And I'm mostly traumatized by Dillon Brooks to pay that much attention in game to other Grizzlies.
"Because he's the best rookie. Edwards has not been good this year, he just takes a lot of shots. That's great that he has glimpses of LeBron, but for now he's closer to Dillon Brooks."

Memphis really gonna let that 8 spot slip away arent they?  edit: why does Dillon Brooks have the highest usage rate by a sizeable margin? Yeah Morant struggles with ball distribution but he at least gets his teammates involved
Just imagine dillon brooks with thj. Its too chad for me
Wolves fan chirping in here. Dillon Brooks is the best offensive player we have ever seen. Please don't insult the offensive god like that....
"On that note, how do you feel about Dillon Brooks? Man that dude is a black hole... I saw him in person a couple weeks back vs the Clips and this man is an offense stopper, looks like he never met a shot he didn't like.  At least he gets paid half of what Buddy does lol"
On the wolves id take Dillon Brooks.  Hes younger and fits the timeline much better.  I know he's a chucker but thats a pretty easy thing for a coach to rein in .  He hustles and plays good defense
Yo this dude is legit actually angry about Dillon fucking Brooks lmaooooooo üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Dillon Brooks fucking sucks and has 0 shot IQ i'd hate his play wherever he was... Idk why you beefing idgaf bout the Grizzlies we'll smack you guys when the time comes.. Enjoy these 2 games thats the highlight of ur season
Imagine letting Dillon brooks get you so angry. It's ok the bad man can't hurt you any more
"On a good team, Danny Green. On a bad team, Dillon Brooks."
Imagine defending Dillon Brooks bruh.. Sad ass franchise

"dillon brooks is the man, I'm a blazers/ducks guy so I can't be mad at him. your mileage may vary"
"Man, I love some of the Memphis guys (when we're not playing them). Love Ja and JJJ, for example. But fuck Dillon Brooks, all the time."
"Fuck Dillon Brooks, talking shit and getting wrecked."
"&gt; wannabe second coming of Pat Beverly   I've heard a lot of things about Dillon Brooks, and I know he's considered a good defender who sometimes fouls too much, but I don't think I've heard this before."
Where's your Dillon Brooks flair /s
"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
Dillon Brooks = Evil Danny Green
"Dillon Brooks. If we get Chad Dillon, the league is fucked. If we get Tunnel Vision Dillon, the Grizzlies are fucked."
I feel like I could recognize Dillon brooks pretty easily
If this happens there is a 500% chance Dillon Brooks and Devin Booker get into a fight
"Grayson Allen (and dare I say Taylor Jenkins?) tried their damnedest to lose this game, but Dillon Brooks was like: ""Nah."""
"Absolutely massive for Memphis to sweep both games in Portland and secure the season series. Playing a team 3 times in less than a week is dumb as hell, but I‚Äôm ecstatic a sweep is on the table  Dillon Brooks is about to impregnate a sizable portion of Multnomah County"
Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks needa be traded no cap lmao
Sometimes I really hate Dillon Brooks.
We are terrible at defending Heat check guys off the bench. Dillon brooks is trash and turns into a god against us.
Meanwhile Dillon Brooks looking more like   Chillin' Brooks
"A third star maybe? Dillon Brooks could maybe be that but i doubt it. I don‚Äôt think Brandon Clarkes ceiling is that high, same with Grayson. I do think Bane can be a good Danny Green type player tho."
Dillon Brooks with 25 points and pretty smothering defence on Dame.
Do you mean Dillon Brooks? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Never forget when Dillon Brooks got 3 IG models pregnant in a span of 6 months lol  Probably went to court and said it was Marshon
Dillon brooks also does a great job on him
Dillon Brooks
1. Dillon Brooks
What about Dillon Brooks?
Numb1 player ~~in minutes~~ for Memphis this year is ~~Dillon~~ Chad Brooks and Memphis is in the playoffs currently in the west in the 8 spot.
"Let's put it this way:  |Position|2017|2018| |:-|:-|:-| |PGs|De'Aaron Fox, Lonzo,  Dennis Smith Jr., Monte Morris|Luka, Trae Young,  Colin Sexton, Jalen Brunson| |Wings|Tatum, Mitchell, OG Anunoby, Kuzma, Hart, Dillon Brooks, Kennard|SGA, MPJ, Bridges (both), DiVincenzo, Kevin Huerter| |Bigs|Bam, Jarrett Allen, John Collins, Bryant, Markkanen|JJJ, Ayton, Wendell Carter Jr., Bagley, Robinson|  Looks pretty even to me. 2018 has way better PGs. 2017 has way better wings. Bigs are pretty even, though I lean toward 2018- didn't even include Robert Williams on that list."
it's unironically Dillon brooks
Yeah but then if Dillon brooks and JV were in it too it might not even have mattered. But can only play the players that are out there.
Dillon Brooks the Nuggets killer was out
"It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been crazy impactful since coming back and like you said they are made of role players, but they probably have some of the most elite role players. Brandon Clarke, Tyus Jones, DeAnthony Melton, Desmond Bane, Kyle Anderson, Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks. Have all been doing their thang this season."
"They were missing a couple guys, Dillon Brooks usually kills us"
"Hell of an effort by the Grizzlies tonight without JV, Jaren, and Dillon Brooks. Hard to be upset with a 2OT loss on the road in your 3rd game in 4 nights in Denver without 3 starters"
"Hell of an effort by the Grizzlies tonight without JV, Jaren, and Dillon Brooks. Hard to be upset with a 2OT loss on the road in your 3rd game in 4 nights in Denver without 3 starters"
"Yea it's one idea like you said. Young core. Which again,  we're one of the youngest teams in the league. So a younger, more well-rounded core than Dallas.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2021/2/4/22263148/memphis-grizzlies-ja-morant-dillon-brooks&amp;ved=2ahUKEwioxr303YvwAhWUaM0KHRmTCZAQtwIwA3oECBEQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2blxm-34jOnD1-Pi11q95L&amp;ampcf=1"
Dillon Brooks every night in his mind.
"Dillon Brooks, Reggie Jackson, and Trae Young have all surprised me"
"Kevin Huerter has to be up there. I didn‚Äôt know he was a solid defender til this series.  But including those who have been eliminated, Dillon Brooks. He looked so ready to show the world what he‚Äôs made of."
Dillon Brooks
SGA/RJ Barrett/Lu Dort/Andrew Wiggins/Dillon Brooks
"This is super cool, thanks for sharing.   Unsurprisingly, Dillon Brooks has 8 streaks with 5 below average lmao"
"Team Canada is looking distressingly stacked with NBA players too, although I'm not sure who has confirmed 100% yet. Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, RJ, CoJo, Khem, Wiggins, Olynyk, Trey Lyles... If I'm their teams' coaches, especially  the guys who played into this postseason, I'm worrying about the damage to their bodies by the end of the summer. It's all just been too intensive since the restart last season."
"I understand what you‚Äôre saying but my point is that Malcolm Brogdon being upset with McMillan isn‚Äôt something that should lead to firing. Of course he‚Äôs upset, it‚Äôd be bad if you weren‚Äôt upset after getting sweeped. But Brogdon, as good as he is, isn‚Äôt a guy the FO has to bend over backwards to keep happy. This would be like Dillon Brooks saying he was unhappy with Taylor Jenkins after losing. FO‚Äôs just can‚Äôt be firing good coaches over stuff like that. There were reports that Jimmy Butler was upset at the Heat coaching staff after getting swept in the first round this year. And that‚Äôs a guy who really should be kept happy, yet the heat aren‚Äôt even considering a change. I really think the locker room stuff was probably salvageable and if it wasn‚Äôt, the FO probably should have chosen to keep McMillan over Brogdon. I think it was largely about the FO thinking their roster was capable of more in the playoffs than they we‚Äôre getting with McMillan when in actuality it doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs true."
I think you meant Dillon Brooks
He dm'ed me and said it's kawhi and dillon brooks I agree
"One thing I've noticed is every team thinks they have an all defense guy even if they're just slightly above average or noticeable from the eye test.   Dillon Brooks for Memphis, Andrew Wiggins on the warriors, Dennis Schroeder on the Lakers. There's only ten spots guys"
"Simmons for Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Deanthony Melton and a first.  Who says no"
"&gt;all players above him are PGs / SGs  Dillon Brooks is iffy so I'll give you that, but you think Tatum, Kawhi, and Tobias Harris are guards?"
"Counting those that have been eliminated, I think Derrick Rose earned himself a nice payday with both his regular season and playoff performances.  Dillon Brooks too, he was ready for the big moment. Shoutout Kevin Huerter as well, money from deep."
"Not saying he deserves it this year, but Dillon Brooks is coming for that All Defensive team in the future."
Dillon Brooks. Put us out of the playoffs. He'd have got my vote just for that.
Dillon Brooks.
Dillon Brooks before they were eliminated
Dillon Brooks should be #1
Dillon brooks
Tucker played as aggressive as Dillon Brooks lol
Dillon Brooks. He gives it 110%.
dillon brooks type beat
Isn‚Äôt this exactly what Ingles did on Dillon Brooks‚Ä¶.
Same dude that couldn‚Äôt guard Dillon Brooks lol Kawhis game gets super ugly in the half court sometimes. He just doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of Moves to go to and gets clamped during stretches.
"&gt;playing a team like the Jazz just shows how much the team and coaches need to work on/strive for.   There were several points where it felt like the Jazz won games because they had that crunch time experience, yeah. And that'll absolutely come with time.   &gt;And I know everyone can't wait to see more Dillon Brooks in the coming years ;) lol  No. Lol"
"For sure. I know all the talk about how young they were got annoying but it was so true, the team was there a year early but playing a team like the Jazz just shows how much the team and coaches need to work on/strive for. The postseason has me so excited for the team's future  And I know everyone can't wait to see more Dillon Brooks in the coming years ;) lol"
Is Michael Porter Jr. the next Dillon Brooks?
So you agree with me that he wasn't on him in game 1.. sure doesn't seem wrong on that point. Ben covered him frequently in game 2. Well I didn't watch that game. So I didn't comment on that. So again how could I be blatantly wrong on something I never said? Shall we bring up Beal scoring 60? Where was this Simmons defender?   My point was Simmons doesn't always take the toughest assignment like some people like to claim. Royce O'Neale and Dillon Brooks had the most time of guarding the teams highest scorer in the nba this season. It's a shame that people don't recognize Simmons for what he is on defense. He's a very good defender capable of switching 1-5 and that makes him very versatile and he can do a lot of things that   others can't on the defensive side.   But these embellishments of him just go against him. Because it's simply not true that he guards the best scorer for most the game. And when Thybulle is in the game Ben is the 2nd best perimeter on his team. But that's not a shot at Ben. Thybulle is just really good mostly because he can focus all his energy on the defensive side of the ball.
I really wanted to trade for CJ until Dillon Brooks channelled his inner Chad and became Villain Brooks.
"Dillon Brooks was not robbed, but I would like to pretend he was robbed."
You don‚Äôt have to. Dillon brooks still locked him up and won them the play in game.
Dillon Brooks can slow Brad Beal down like no one else
Dillon brooks had him in jail lmao
"Superstars: Players in their prime that have won league MVP or played at an MVP level in the Regular Season, Playoffs, and/or both.   - Bron Bron  - KD - Jokic - Kawhi - Curry - Harden - Giannis  - Luka  - Street Clothes  - Kyrie  - Dame  - Embiid   Bron Bron:   &gt; Draymond Green   KD:  &gt;   Kawhi:  &gt; PJ Tucker (check the stats)   Curry:  &gt; Dillon Brooks cuz I can‚Äôt remember who else really slows him down 1v1   Harden:  &gt; Wes Matthews   Jokic:  &gt; DeAndre Ayton (No, it ain‚Äôt just recency bias nephews)   Giannis:  &gt; ~~The freethrow line~~ Just kidding, probably Jonathan Isaac   Embiid:  &gt; Marc Gasol aka Big Daddy Spain  Luka:  &gt; Porzingis   AD:  &gt; Draymond Green   Kyrie:  &gt; No idea. Any ideas?  Dame:  &gt; Jrue Holiday"
"I didn't watch all the games, but based on what I saw and the stats, Dillon Brooks gave Luka more trouble."
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
Utah is racist as fuck did you even see what they did to Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks families?
Dillon brooks
"I once saw Dillon Brooks in person and started yelling: ""Dillon Brooks! Yo it's Dillon!"" He was not Dillon Brooks, but rather Marshon. Earnest mistake."
dillon brooks smiling in the corner
Nah. Dillon Brooks has a punchable face
"Warrior fans (or anyone else for that matter) who says Curry is better than KD is just plain wrong. I am a Curry lifer but KD is the best offensive player in the league, no question.  Remember how Dillon brooks manhandled Curry in the last 2 games we played the grizzlies. If that was KD, Dillon brooks will be sweeping the floor."
That was Dillon Brooks and Marshon Brooks  So neither
Dillon Brooks still exists
"so in this outcome the jazz get dillon brooks  i mean, hes no mitchell but thats....aite"
I think Dillon brooks should be higher
Bubble Dillon Brooks is one of the worst players I've ever watched  End of 2021 Dillon Brooks is quite the opposite
"He was killing it at the end of the season, but Dillon Brooks"
Dillon Brooks when he‚Äôs cold
Did you watch Dillon Brooks guard Curry? You can be physical in the game today.
"Heres some perspective for you  The Knicks ranked 3rd in point allowed per 100 possesions, The 76ers are 2nd, and the Clippers are 7th. Trae is doing it against better defenses.  &amp;#x200B;  Heres some more perspective, Luka has 39.1% USG in the playoffs, Trae has 34.1%.  Thats the same gap in usage as Trae vs Dillon Brooks."
"&gt;downplaying the historical performance of Luka.  It wasn't a historical performance. Lillards performance was better. Booker's was comparable and better in some ways. Ja Morant and Mitchell were also really good. We live in an era where Dillon Brooks scores 25 ppg a playoff series.  &gt;Some Hawks fan are even saying that Trae proved that he is the better player by advancing to the secound round, which is laughable  Some? What is some? One or two? I see a lot more Mavs fans get super defensive that Trae Young and Ayton has progressed to the second round while Doncic hasn't.  &gt;Now let's talk about the the Mavs roster.  Speaking about rosters... Look at Lebron who you compared Luka too. He went to the ECF with a worse roster. He had a better regular season record despite being on a much worse team than Luka has these past two years. Lebron at the same age was on another level from Luka.  &gt;Taking all of this into account, it is undeniable that what Luka did this series is historical.  It isn't. Look at how efficient Lillard was. Look at his assist/to ratio. It wasn't even the best first round performance for a point guard this year. Last year so many Mav fans were talking shit about making the playoffs while Ayton and Trae weren't good enough too (despite the Mavs being better). Now the opposite has happened and Mavs fans are being super defensive."
"We live in an era Dillon Brooks puts up &gt;25 PPG in a series though. Lillard, Booker, Ja Morant, and Mitchell all put up great stat lines too. I would argue Lillard put up better and could make an argument Booker put up better as well."
Danny Green better transform into Dillon Brooks if he gonna keep guarding Trae
"I said then and I still say now that we should've gotten Dillon Brooks with our 10th pick that draft instead of bust Zach Collins, but I'm also biased because he and Jordan Bell led my college team to a final four. Grizzlies got a STEAL with him and I'm happy he's doing well with them."
i used to think that dillon brooks was just a RSHK but he has proven to actually be really good
"Ja morant and Dillon brooks, you could even go as far as the Grizzlies as a whole, they didn‚Äôt win much but they played really well"
Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks for sure
honestly dillon brooks is so fun to watch
"miles bridges, de'arron fox, dillon brooks"
For me it‚Äôs Dillon Brooks. He averaged like 26 in the series against the Jazz
Dillon Brooks
What blows my mind is the guy is a bucket. Legit scoring threats are really valuable and hard to come across. He's not getting his 20 a game simply from open 3s and backdoor cuts. He earns majority of his points.   Yet even if I'm the grizzlies who could really use another scoring option I'd be hesitant to look at a package of  Dillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke. That itself probably doesn't even start the conversation for Portland either because you're giving up a borderline Allstar level talent for pennies. Crazy..
"Excluding the Knicks... I'd say Dillon Brooks, Shai, Jaden McDaniels"
Dillon Brooks‚Äô mentor üò≠
if you told me dillon brooks would have a x100 better playoff performance than kuz at the start of the seasonI  wouldn‚Äôt have believed you lol
"For example Utah, Donovan‚Äôs shot over Dillon brooks was amazing and the noise from the crowd was also but you could only see the hands of the people sitting courtside."
"Happy to see a post like this, almost wrote one myself. Everyone is like ""omg ja morant average ### PPG omg dillon brooks averaged ### ppg in their first postseason series ever!""  Yes, in todays NBA where it is vastly different than even just 5/6 years ago, let alone 10/20 years ago."
"Damian Lillard, Dillon Brooks, John Wall"
No wonder Memphis didn't want to trade Dillon Brooks.      Incredible from both Mitchell and Brooks.
I loved watching the Grizzlies play. Despite Dillon Brooks being a pest it is pretty much impossible to dislike this team. So much fire and even when we were up 30 I wasn't 100% confident we'd win
Comparing Dillon Brooks to Danny Green is so lazy. They have completely different games lol. Are we only talking about their looks?
I‚Äôm talking about Dillon Brooks. I didn‚Äôt dismiss any upgrades. But I‚Äôm tired of the ‚Äòget Ja some help‚Äô people who clearly don‚Äôt know the Grizz roster or watch them.
"grant brooks jjjr  how? don't know. but Draymond said better. Memphis needs to decide now if they gonna run it back or not. I believe that they should change now, get Dallas pick and find another star to pair with Ja. They're underutilizing JJJr. And there's no way they trade Dillon.  go for Jerami Grant, and find a fucking rim protector ffs. Nets found Claxton, so it's not impossible.  IMO, the more important move should be in FO (look Boston). but it's not gonna happen."
Dillon Bricks grew into Villain Brooks. You love to see it.

"Yeah blaming Jenkins for the Jazz cooking the Grizz that series is rough. Jazz have way too many weapons to have Dillon Brooks be the only real positive perimeter guy. You can't live with Ja on Conley/Mitchell so one of them always had a guy they could cook. Can't put JJJ on Bogdanovic etc. They just didn't have the personnel to disrupt the Jazz offense that series, not much a coach could do."
"For all the casuals, I would like to point out the respect mike and donovan had for dillon brooks at the end there"
I was thinking ‚Äúwhat tf did Dillon Brooks do‚Äù lol
"kill fuck marry  Jazz - Mike Conley, Donovan , Clarkson  Grizz - Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen"
He will return as a Ziggy Stardust form of Dillon Brooks. League fucked
Jazz up by 34 crowd still booing Dillon Brooks every time he touches the ball  Sometimes being a low sports-IQ fanbase has its advantages
"Why are the refs giving Dillon Brooks, of all people, these ticky tack foul calls?"
Dillon brooks jumped into Rudy. Fuck outta here
Dillon Brooks is a superstar
Later grizz dudes. Hopefully Dillon Brooks boards a rocket to the sun and never returns.
Thank you Dillon Brooks for making this possible. Shooting early and giving up on the defensive transition right after getting cooked on the previous play
Victim is Dillon brooks
Got that Dad energy after adopting Dillon Brooks
donovan said fuck outta here to dillon brooks

Dillon Brooks has made a grave mistake.

Dillon Brooks getting cooked by Mitchell. You absolutely love to see it.

Not even gonna call Dillon Brooks? /s
"League average this year was 36.7% from 3, so he shoots a bit better than league average. Also, the Grizzlies current starter at the 3 is Dillon Brooks, who is a good defender, but shoots 34.4% from 3. There's a decent chance that Saddiq starts for them."
"And also Dillon Brooks, since he's evil Danny Green"
Dillon Brooks would be looking like prime Pippen if this rule existed
Dillon Brooks would have spent the last 5 Summers in a gym shooting jump shots everyday until he was blue in the face if he were Simmons
dillon brooks mentality with ben simmons player skills
this man don't know bout CHAD DILLON BROOKS
One Dillon Brooks please
I have to go with the CP3 secret tunnel incident. But I‚Äôll add a few others to the list:   Jimmy Butler‚Äôs ‚Äúyou (bleeping) need me‚Äù saga from the end of his Minnesota days.    The Dillon/Marshon Brooks trade confusion.   The Lakers protests.   Kyrie and Boston   Lemon Pepper Lou
"Healthy Canada   G Murray  G SGA  F RJ F WIGGINS  C TT  Bench: Dort, Powell, Dillon Brooks, NAW, Khem Burch, Boucher"
"Canada produces the 2nd most nba players but we can never get it together. Wiggins just recently started to commit to Canada basketball but theres no sense of cohesion and togetherness.   Shai and Dillon Brooks are young players, probably didn‚Äôt want to risk getting injured and losing a massive contract."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker‚Ä¶. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
Dillon Brooks and Dwight Powell too.  Sad we didnt get to see Team Canada at full strength for the Olympic qualies

"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
He legitimately hates Dillon brooks so practice would be fun lmao
2021 Warriors couldnt beat Dillon Brooks. 2018 Cavs with Peak LeBron would destroy them
"Dillon ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
"it happens.  Bill Simmons &amp; Russilo spent like 15 solid minutes wondering why Dillon Brooks wasn't on the Team USA Olympic roster a couple weeks ago... he's Canadian, too!"
"I mean, with SGA, Boucher, and Murray out due to injury, and dillon brooks not committing to the team for whatever reason, of course team Canada would have to resort to players like Bennett"
"No patriotism like Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke Have for Canada."
"Kind of patriotism Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke have for Canada."
After watching last night boy would I love to have Dillon Brooks added to this roster
Dillon Brooks isn‚Äôt patriotic.. not by his actions.
"Yeah, Oubre making basically twice as much as Dillon Brooks is super dumb lol"
Man has Dillon brooks syndrome without the defense
PG: Ja Morant  SG: Dillon Brooks  SF: Kyle Anderson  PF: Jaren Jackson Jr  C: Jonas Valencunias
Has Dillon Brooks said why he didn't play the qualifiers?
I believe Dillon Brooks as well
"Aside from SGA/Murray injuries, we need other NBA players to buy in as well. Imagine if we had Olynyk, Dillon Brooks, Oshae o'Brissett, Khem Birch, Tristan Thompson for today's game"
22- Jon√°s Valanciunas  23-Ja Morant  24- Jaren Jackson Jr.   25- Dillon Brooks  26- Xavier Tillman  27- Desmond Bane  28- Tyus Jones  29- Kyle Anderson  30- DeAnthony Melton    And Dillon Brooks is the first ever 8x DPOY
"That‚Äôs crazy to me. I guess because this season was so fucked up they had a hard time getting players? You‚Äôd think Canada would at least be like a top 5 team, *at least.* Nick Nurse, coach. A roster with NBA players on it. But where are like SGA and Tristan Thompson and Kelly O and Dillon Brooks? Was Jamal Murray planning on playing? How has Canada missed the Olympics 5 straight times???  I hope they get their shit together and put together a squad."
Shoulda selected Dillon Brooks smh
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard¬†Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard¬†Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard¬†Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man¬†[Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man¬†[Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs¬†[Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591)¬†and¬†[Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121)¬†are sitting out the qualifiers."
"Wait, Dillon Brooks is Canadian!?!  /barkley‚Äôd"
"And Jamal Murray, Dillon Brooks, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olnyk, Tristan Thompson, etc."
"We needed Jamal Murray, SGA, dillon brooks, chis boucher, kelly olynyk and khem birch."
Dillon Brooks just averaged 26/4/2 on 52/40/80 shooting in the playoffs and we extended him for less than Kuzma makes
Shae + Dillon brooks over schroeder
"Easier said when you are  far away from the United States, and the influences of agents and the nba, all the time- not just in season. It‚Äôs sad Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Kabengele, and Brandon Clarke dont care enough to bother to play for Canada."
"Surprised they didn't take Dillon Brooks, though"
"Missing a few solid players too. Dillon Brooks, SGA, Murray and Olynk some of the bigger names."
I don‚Äôt think Dillon Brooks is 44
"Not to mention Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, and Khem Birch."
"If SGA and Murray were with the team, they would have been a lock for silver. Not saying silver is out of reach even with the current roster, but they need to play better as a team and develop chemistry. Dillon Brooks, Tristan, and Oshae joining after the qualifiers would be really helpful too."
Dillon Brooks would have been another nice piece too.
Dillon Brooks too. They‚Äôd be unstoppable.
I wanted to dillon brooks an Dort playing together
"As well as Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Oshae Brisset, Dillon Brooks and a couple others. Fully healthy this team would be scary"
I feel like you're forgetting about Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen.
"What reality am I living in where Grayson Allen is likable lmao  I'm kidding. Their brand of basketball in the playoffs was incredibly easy to root for. Ja is charismatic and Dillon Brooks, a villain to Utah, was incredible to watch as a 3rd party viewer."
Eh Dillon Brooks and RJ are probably better.
Dillon Brooks because he‚Äôs a T-Rex with those short ass arms. It‚Äôs so noticeable I hate it. But you said besides obvious reasons so I guess this doesn‚Äôt count
Kevin Durant wanted Dillon Brooks.
"Already talked about some of these so I'll focus on the ones that I haven't. Duncan Robinson is definitely one of the best contract in the NBA, considering he's an elite three point shooter, though he's a restricted free agent next year so who knows how much he gets. I wouldn't say Poeltl is underpaid, he's a good player but I think he's paid appropriately. Boucher is good value considering he's giving you 13.6 and 6.7 boards off the bench for about 7 mil, Dillon Brooks definitely went under my radar and is a very decent contract going forward, I like Smart and his contract is definitely good (I just wish he would shoot less threes), TJ Warren averages a quiet 20 points per game on great efficiency when healthy and is only getting 12 million next year, Clarkson has flourished in his sixth man role for the Jazz and is locked up until 23-24 only getting paid 14.2 mil at most, and Sabonis is an All-Star player getting paid under 20 million until 23-24 so great value there   *holy shit that's a lot*"
Bill Simmons also said he wanted Dillon Brooks on the US Olympic team lol
I died when Simmons was so adamant about Huerter deserving to be on the Olympic team alongside....Canadian Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks gonna take out the USA in the Olympics! Total dawg!
Would Bird have score 50 or 60 or Dillon Brooks?
This is a KD alt shitting on Bill Simmons recent take that they should've taken Dillon Brooks for team USA. KD basically did an Alley opp to himself here lol. Followed by CJ and KD lol
Looks like [he withdrew from the team](https://www.tsn.ca/dillon-brooks-oshae-brissett-not-in-training-camp-with-canadian-national-team-1.1658118).
"Where's my boy Dillon tha Villain? (aka ""the other Brooks"")"
"No Shai, Olynyk, Boucher, Dillon Brooks :("
He wants to see that Dillon Brooks-Deandre Ayton P&amp;R
In the other pod Simmons was also advocating for Dillon Brooks to be on team USA. Dillon Brooks is Canadian. I think Simmons might be senile.
"Ja was overrated but it‚Äôs not his fault, it was the fault of some casual fans. They didn‚Äôt really watch games and overrated him like a mf. One of the reasons why is bc Memphis is full of underrated players that don‚Äôt have that much recognition. Because of that, ppl think ja has no help and is absolutely hard carrying them. Before the warriors had the hot stretch near the end of the season, some casual fans were saying that ja was better than Curry bc he was carrying them to a better record with a worse supporting cast than Curry. For those who watch games tho, we know how deep Memphis is. JV is an elite center, Kyle Anderson was having a career year, Dillon Brooks was proving to be a scary scorer along with bringing intense defense, etc. it‚Äôs a very solid team, unlike what casual fans think. Another reason that he was getting overrated was bc of the casual fans who only watched his highlights. Just based off his highlights, ja looks like a top 5 point guard and some genuinely believed so bc of it. However, for those who watched games, they‚Äôd know how inconsistent he was. He‚Äôd have stretches of insane scoring and then insanely cold stretches. Because of that he isn‚Äôt a top 5 point guard or anything close to it. So yes, I do believe ja was overrated and I actually really like ja."
KD wants to invade and conquer twitter so Dillon Brooks can play on the olympic team.
Somewhere there is an American Dillon Brooks lacing up.
This thread is now being monitored by disciples of [His Chadliness.](https://i.imgur.com/NVPDqDz.jpg) Any disrespectful Dillon Brooks hot takes will be promptly refuted and shamed.
Sauga legend Dillon Brooks
No Dillon Brooks ? He's injured maybe ?
RIP Dillon Brooks Team USA hypotheticals 6/28/2021 - 6/28/2021

Dillon Brooks blew by Jaylen Brown for a clutch shot that beat Boston.
Nope. He talked about Dillon Brooks being a candidate for Team Canada a couple weeks ago.
"Weird to see Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks off the final team, while Bennet and some euro players made the cut"
"Lu Dort and Dillon Brooks, to start."
"There's a lot of good answers for the Grizz - Dillon Brooks taking steps to become a really good two way player by taking smarter shots and not fouling, Ja developing his 3 ball, and JJJ improving his shot and fouling issues. Lots to be excited about"
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
Feels like Dillon Brooks should be here.
idk what the wolves did to dillon brooks but he legit puts up like 28 a game lol
"It isn't all about volume stats. In his third year in the league, Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50/25. Is he the undisputed goat? Or do we live in an era where 40 point games are dropped every other day in the playoffs and Dillon Brooks averages 25 points a game. Similarly, we shouldn't look at raw numbers from Wilt, we should looking at raw numbers from players nowadays to compare with past."
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
"When it first came out many of us kept telling ourselves well this guy has been around so much winning basketball maybe he'll know how to do it here.   After some rough patches, like his assuming they were trading for Dillon Brooks (and somehow coming out of it with swagger master Oubre), Jones has done exactly that, he just seems to get it. And he has been ever flexible not trying to get players just for talent but identifying exactly what Book and DA need around them.  He was apparently the reason they picked Mikal Bridges too. Mcdonough wanted Gilgeous-Alexander which may not have been too shabby but I like the cp3 guy we ended up with nonetheless."
Lol I'm pretty sure the highest paid coach in the league makes like... Dillon Brooks money
So many horrible memories of Dillon Brooks over the last couple years lol
"Pat Bev is good when he isn‚Äôt called for fouls or plays against better ball handlers. He‚Äôs like Dillon Brooks, just super aggressive and physical but that can lead to fouls. But he has gotten smoked countless times by some of the superstar PGs of the league."
"Defensive is best portrayed through eye test, not stats. Statistically, sabonis is a better defender than embiid since sabonis has a DBPM of 1.5 compared to embiid‚Äôs 1.0. If you watch games tho, you‚Äôd know that that is far from the case. Embiid is an elite defender while sabonis is a traffic cone. There‚Äôs so many good defenders that are net negative on DBPM as well, not just Wiggins. Marcus smart, Paul George, lu Dort, Dillon brooks, and capela are all net negatives according to DBPM. Now if you just look at stats, this would make you think that montrezl harrell, who is a positive on DBPM, is a better defender than all of them. Well, that is false. This is why you need to watch games and not just rely on stats"
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12.

Maybe they can sell a late 2nd for cap space or extra beer money? Unless they see some real Dillon Brooks-like potential that falls to 55?
"Not one of the teams you listed, but Dillon Brooks"
I think the only player who can give Demar fits is Dillon Brooks. He can cook the best defender on most teams if there‚Äôs no help on the way.
Yeah I‚Äôm taking Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks over those guys
True but it doesn't really help that the league is so soft. Dillon Brooks actually trying his best on D and he just fouls out since we don't like when people try unless you're Gobert and can block a shot while standing 3 feet away from someone.
Ben with Curry's shooting and Dillon Brooks confidence lmao
Oh yes please. Dillon brooks at the 2 would be perfect next to Cade
FUCK DILLON BROOKS
"Dillon Brooks ended the season strong.  He's on a cheap contract so I don't get trading him for anything other than a star.  I get there are concerns with his fouling and shot selection/3 point percentage, but of he can get those things under control he becomes very good.  At worst he is an excellent 6th man/role player.  His defense and potential scoring would be big on a lot of teams."
Knows his place dillon fucking brooks?? There‚Äôs a reason this guy is hate both within and outside the fanbase until recently. This guy will argue the mavs are his team now
Dillon Brooks
I honestly had no idea how overrated Dillon Brooks was. I feel like people saw good Dillon Brooks for a few games in the playoffs and overlooking what he is in the aggregate
You know nothing about Dillon Brooks. This man has shit talked LeBron into going LeThanos on us like 3 times in the past two seasons lol.
Aaron Gordon got traded for basically two 1sts.  There is no way in hell Dillon Brooks on a 2/$24M contract isn‚Äôt getting the same return or equivalent value.
"You‚Äôre not wrong. There was a point in February last season where you could ask just about any Grizzlies fan, and they would be okay with trading away Dillon Brooks. But since our last memory of Brooks is a solid one, we are all high on him, for now."
Leave Dillon Brooks alone.
Dillon Brooks would be beyond incredible. 100% the type of player the Pistons are trying to develop and rebuild with.
Would love hometown Dillon Brooks.
"Rotation was crowded and they're giving the keys to Jaren. JV was great for us and is an amazing floor raiser but fact is when Memphis will be competing he will be in his 30s, and he already struggles on the defensive end. Grayson getting dealt made sense because they have Melton and Bane under 3 years of control and they have more potential, but Jenkins would play Grayson over them no matter what.  All that being said, if Dillon Brooks is dealt, yeah they're tanking. I don't think that's the case however he fits perfectly in the timeline, I'm not sure why a Cavs reporter would know this."
"Play-in Dillon Brooks trick yall. His energy and hustle are real but he's a volume scorer that can't actually score. His TS is absolutely putrid. Defensively, his foul rate is way too high."
DONT. TOUCH. DILLON. BROOKS. THANK YOU.
Incredible pass by Dillon Brooks. Floated it right up there for him to go get it.
"Look, the West is arguably as stacked as ever, but I have the Jazz, Suns, Lakers, Warriors and Nuggets going over .500.  Dallas I think their weakness of not having a reliable secondary ball handler was exposed and more teams will start to play more physical defensively that their offense will suffer. Kidd isn't necessarily one you'd call a defensive coach so their defense probably wouldn't improve either. And honestly, the only guy that can take a significant leap in my eyes is Porzingis because Luka is already putting up historic stats for a player entering his 4th year and he'd have to do put up even more unprecedented stats regardless of age for the Mavs to improve in a way that does not involve Porzingis. Their ""young"" players are already in very specific roles and Brunson is already too efficient that his efficiency will take a back seat even if he manages to get more points.  Portland I think will take a step back largely because they've just replaced a head coach on the longest active playoff streak with a first time HC. Their 3rd-worst all time defense will get better by virtue of getting rid of Melo and Kanter, but their 2nd-best all time offense is not really sustainable either. Stotts has a lot of flaws defensively but offensively I think he utilized them to the best of his abilities because I don't really think Portland has the personnel to run a ball movement-oriented offense.  The Clippers are my favorite team outside of Golden State, but for the obvious reason, Kawhi is probably out for the whole year. PG has also missed about 20 games the last 2 seasons and the year before that he had to injuries in both shoulders, I'm not trusting him to miss &lt;10 games. I don't really trust Reggie Jackson to replicate his playoff run, and although they have a really well-built offensive system, they just don't have enough big-time scorers outside of PG, Morris and Jackson that they'll be good enough to win 40+. They also seriously lack bigs.  Memphis just traded away their 2nd best player in Jonas Valanciunas for Steven Adams, 35-year old Rajon Rondo and Jarrett Culver, and they're going even younger by trading up for Ziaire Williams. For a team that's way ahead of the rebuilding timeline, they also have too many flaws and ultimately Adams is no longer a good enough center on both ends of the floor that his production will be a big enough minus compared to Jonas. Ja Morant will have to take a serious leap or his fellow co-starters Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr. will have to be disciplined enough defensively and be a good enough threat from 3.  I have Minnesota making the Play-In but a team on a 26-win pace (in an 82-game scale) probably isn't going to improve by 16 wins, especially when they've underperformed compared to their expectations for basically every year they had expectations (since KG left).   Also, simply put, the West has too many middle-of-the-pack teams that instead of all of them going over .500, they'll balance each other out and fall under it to make a competitive playoff/play-in race.  This probably are opinions that many will disagree with and I'm probably gonna be flooded with downvotes. But this is a controversial opinion thread, and I might as well say it."
To be fair Memphis has had the bad habit of making our guys' nicknames basically just their initials for a while. TA -Tony Allen Zbo - Zach Randolph DB - Dillon Brooks JJJ - Jaren Jackson Jr JV - Jonas Valanciunas  etc etc etc
"Everyone in this thread is saying Kings have a worse roster but Hield, Bogdanovic, Barnes would have all started for Memphis. Holmes is a perfectly good center. Ja is a leader and creates wins. Maybe Fox would drag his team to the play in with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson and JV, we'll never know but we know Ja did."
"the disrespect to prime Jordan reincarnate Dillon ""the GOAT"" Brooks"
"Knicks  2016 - no picks 2017 - Donovan Mitchell, Dillon Brooks 2018 - SGA, Mitchell Robinson 2019 - RJ Barrett 2020 - Obi Toppin, Immanual Quickley  I think this has been proof of how well the Knicks FO has done in the draft. I‚Äôd still take Obi over Halliburton because in the context of this prompt we wouldn‚Äôt need him.  SGA Donovan Mitchell RJ Barrett Obi Toppin Mitchell Robinson 6th man: Quickley"
Duck you Dillon Brooks
2016: Dejountae Murray PG (29) 2020: Halliburton SG (11) 2017: Dillon brooks SF (29) 2019: Keldon Johnson PF (19) 2018: Mitchell Robinson C (18)  Spurs didn‚Äôt do all that bad considering where they were drafting tbh. A little bias picking Murray over Brogdon but I‚Äôm bias
"Kings  2016- 8th Domantas Sabonis(11th), 59th Fred VanVleet (UFA)  2017- 5th Donovan Mitchell (13th), 10th Bam Adebayo(14th), 34th Dillon Brooks (45th)  Was kind of tore between Fox and Mitchell but I picked Mitchell. If Sac doesn‚Äôt trade the 10th pick, both Mitchell and Fox would be the choice at 5 and 10.   2018- 2nd Luka Doncic (3rd), 37th Gary Trent (37th but Traded to Portland)  2019- 40th Bol Bol(44th) or Eric Paschall(41st), 47th Terrence Mann(48th), 60th Naz Reid(UFA)  2020- I‚Äôm okay with the picks from 2020 2021-Too Early to Tell"
"JJJ is the one for the Grizz, this is a big year for him to prove it. Otherwise he‚Äôs in the same tier as Bagley (and the same goes for marvin)  Unless Dillon brooks becomes jrue holiday 2.0 in which case that backcourt is gonna be great"
"Man imagine someone saying ""nah of course KD numbers took a step down this year. He had Valanciunas and Dillon Brooks on his team."" Ludicrous argument lmao"
Ja had JV and Dillon Brooks to share the scoring load with. Who did SGA have? Dort? Lol
I'm kinda mad this can't happen anymore but beverley + dillon brooks for simmons I do be happy for as the sixers
Dillon brooks or Jaren Jackson will be the number 2. Beverly isn't even close

"Huge dropoff? Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Boucher, CLarke, Olynyk, Birch, Powell, Alexander-Walker  As far as international rosters go, that's quite good depth"
The whole MarShon/Dillon Brooks trade mix-up will always be funny to me.
The grizzlies just have Dillon Brooks
&gt; Dude lost to Dillon Brooks lol  And you guys lost to PJ tucker lol  See how dumb that looks?
Dude lost to Dillon Brooks lol
Dawg don‚Äôt disrespect Dillon Brooks like that lol
Grizzlies offense is basically Ja and Dillon Brooks now.  Without major help they're not making the playoffs in the West.
"Well I have to take that with a grain of salt because there is a huge pile of it.   Aside from Rondo and Bev, I don't think non - Grizz fans can hate any current Grizz player. Maybe Dillon Brooks for his hard defense and shit talk or Ja for whatever reason."
Dillon Brooks. He‚Äôs already 25 but he just averaged 26 ppg in the series against Utah. Don‚Äôt think he can average 26 in a season but I think he could peak at 20-22 ppg over a whole season with all nba level defense.   Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be a superstar but could be a fringe all star in a couple years if he can be consistent
I'm so heavily confused as well for the clips? A dillon brooks and pat bev back court defense and foul fest would be nuts for 5-10 minutes a game.  Rondo can provide back up since tyus is very average.
yea but imagine him and dillon brooks in the same court
Him and Dillon Brooks are gonna piss off/clamp opposing guards to no end
"It enables Memphis to put out a PatBev / Dillon Brooks backcourt, which may legitimately be the most annoying backcourt in the league?"
Might be too late hut dillon brooks
bev finna go crazy in memphis fr . I just hope they get rid of dillon brooks school threat ass
Dillon Brooks?
Need a spin-off series with Dillon Brooks and Pat Bev where they‚Äôre Roommate‚Äôs in a new town
Dillon Brooks and Pat Bev on the same team is so chaotic
Dillon Brooks babyyy
"tyrese haliburton, luka doncic, dillon brooks, michael porter jr., richaun holmes  bench: demond bane, jalen green, terence mann, og anunoby, robert williams"
"Dillon Brooks was incredible for the Grizzlies at the end of the season.  If his shot selection gets better, his 3point shooting continues to improve, and he stops fouling out the sky is the limit.  He's on a very team friendly contact at the moment.  Really surprised he was in some trade rumors because his production cant be matched on his salary."
Dillon Brooks!!
"JJJ wins most improved, Dillon Brooks gets First Team All Defense, and Ja makes the all star roster"
"Can‚Äôt think of just one player  Fox, Isaac (when healthy), Brook Lopez, Jae‚ÄôSean tate, Dillon brooks, tj McConnell, richaun Holmes, Larry nance"
"When I think of underated I think of a player who most fans dont realize how good he is. I'd say Deandre Hunter, I feel like the Hawks would've been in the finals if he was healthy. Dillon Brooks is one of my favorites, hes one of the best defenders in the league, super grity and tough personality, good scorer on and off the ball."
"I‚Äôm gonna say Dillon Brooks  He‚Äôs probably never going to be an All Star or anything, but he‚Äôs young and has potential to be a solid scorer and defender on the wing.  He averaged 26 against the Jazz on great shooting, I don‚Äôt think he could do something like that in the regular season, but I could see him being a 19-22 points per game on solid efficiency, and above average defense."
Dillon Brooks!!!
"I fucking love Dillon Brooks. I wish the Blazers could find some way to get him, he'd be such a great fit. I'm also an Oregon fan though so obviously I'm biased."

"&gt;Curry has been an underrated defender over his career. Though he can be attacked with size, his ability to read passing lanes and defensive rebounds allows him to make strong contributions in off-ball situations. As he‚Äôs aged and Golden State‚Äôs overall defensive context has worsened, his impact has waned somewhat. But he still finished in the top 100 (97th) in dRAPM over the last three years. However, his size is the main factor that keeps him from Tier 1A, both because of his comparative defensive drawbacks but also in terms of the way it can make him a bit more schemable than the very top players. Case in point was the Play-In contest against Memphis, where he scored 39 but also had seven turnovers with Dillon Brooks‚Äô ball denial serving to strangle several other Golden State possessions."
If Dillon Brooks is evil Danny Green then Denzel Valentine is Danny Green at home
Dillon Brooks DOES have a real Wario energy and I never could put my finger on why
"If he can get his fouling under control, we have two legitimate DPOY candidates with him and Dillon Brooks starting.  That's a pretty big fucking if though in year 4."
He couldn‚Äôt close out dillon brooks tho
bruh she was ready for dillon brooks during the play ins and play offs
Dillon Brooks and Duncan Robinson
"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.   He started this process last year, but he still took more than 40% of his shots from midrange (10 ft+). That meant he was still an inefficient scorer despite shooting 41% on threes.  Among the 20 players who have taken the most 10+ foot 2PA over the past two seasons, the Lakers have 3 of the 4 worst (plus LeBron, who has the worst FG% (35.5%) among players with 400+ FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|FG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Anthony Davis|207|552|.375| |2|Jayson Tatum|218|565|.386| |3|Russell Westbrook|304|777|.391| |4|Carmelo Anthony|275|665|.414| |5|Julius Randle|278|665|.418| |6|Dillon Brooks|269|638|.422| |7|Bradley Beal|313|712|.440| |8|Joel Embiid|272|613|.444| |9|Nikola Vucevic|279|628|.444| |10|Kawhi Leonard|332|736|.451| |11|Brandon Ingram|337|741|.455| |12|Jamal Murray|248|545|.455| |13|Donovan Mitchell|256|555|.461| |14|DeMar DeRozan|415|898|.462| |15|Dejounte Murray|288|623|.462| |16|Nikola Jokic|268|555|.483| |17|Devin Booker|434|893|.486| |18|Khris Middleton|363|742|.489| |19|CJ McCollum|314|629|.499| |20|Chris Paul|464|884|.525|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 8/10/2021."
"Memphis has really nailed the last few drafts.  Ja was an easy pick, but JJJ has shown awesome flashes when healthy, Brandon Clarke had a great rookie year (not sure what happened this last year), Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen,  and now Bane.   JJJ just needs to pop alongside Ja!"
Dillon Fucking Brooks
[Totally mutual](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2875053-andre-iguodala-responds-to-grizzlies-ja-morant-dillon-brooks-after-heat-trade)
The Dillon Brooks* one you mean?  I think that‚Äôs a clear offensive foul
"How useful are advanced metrics, especially defensive ones? According to advanced defensive metrics Kyle Anderson is a much better defensive player than Dillon Brooks. In fact, according to BPM and VORP, Kyle Anderson is the best player on the grizzlies. None of that makes sense to me."
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
I'd be surprised if dillon brooks plays in 2024. Had no interest this year as far as I could tell
"RJ, Dillon Brooks, Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, NAW, Khem Birch, Olynyk, etc. They won't challenge the US, but are definitely a medal contender if everyone plays"
I am a huge Brooks fan but google him he did same stuff in college and Grayson like Dillon has matured out of that stuff for the most part.  I think Memphis will miss his scoring off the bench.
Nah. We usually trade up back into the 1st with our 2nd round picks on the NBA draft. So expect us to use those 2nd round picks to do the same.  We also didnt want to pay Allen with JJJ up for an extension and Ja not far behind. Also gives us some leeway to decide on Dillon Brooks future. Plus we are super high on Desmond Bane and he likely gets more minutes with Allen gone.
Maybe a Dillon Brooks ? Dejaunte Murray now without Derozan? MPJ might be a popular choice with Murray‚Äôs injury.
"IMO Colangelo did a worse job than Billy King during his mutilation of the Nets.  At least King's moves had a somewhat sound logical basis. Colangelo was a total moron selling 2nd round draft picks (he sold the rights to Sterling Brown in 2017), and using 2 first rounders to draft Fultz, one of the biggest busts of the decade. There are reports that Colangelo overrode his staff's concerns when Fultz had terrible workouts.   Also, here are a few players drafted after Paseƒç≈Üiks (25):  * Kuzma (27) * Derrick White (29) * Josh Hart (30) * Wes Iwundu (33) * Dillon Brooks (45)  In summary, fuck the Colangelos."
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
If they get their guys then they should be able to a top 5ish country in the world. Shai and Murray would be one of the better backcourts and you'd have toughness with Dillon Brooks and Dort plus a couple of at least capable frontcourt options in Olynk and Powell.   I think they just missed having Shai and Murray in this years qualifying cause they didn't really have the playmaking.   Plus isn't the Primo kid the Spurs just drafted Canadian?
"Valenciunas has been a major liability on defense throughout the season last year. While he was amazing on offense, part of the reason why he was great at it was because he had to. Jaren Jackson Jr was recovering from his injury. This season would be his contract extension and he will ask for a lot. The man deserves to be paid nicely but we need the cap space when we give Ja and JJJ big contracts. Maybe even Dillon Brooks too.   Trading for Adams should theoretically means our young core will get more looks. They should take the reigns. It also works financially as his contract is for the next 2 seasons. Also, Adams won't get as easily picked off in defense. There's also the nice bonus that he's a calm vet."
"Yea but the point is if the warriors are as good as their fans claim they shouldn't have lost to you guys, no disrespect, although in all fairness Dillon Brooks going off was a surprise  Although I don't understand why u guys traded Valenciunas for Adams tbh"
anthony edwards is  ja morant and dillon brooks got to the 8 seed last year and you're telling me KAT and Ant and D'lo cant do it?
"Caruso should be happy that he rode coattails for a few years, played some good defense, and managed to walk out of it having stolen from the Bulls. Caruso put up 6/2/2 with good defense for a guard; that's not worth more than $9 million a year. Don't be sad because it's over, be happy because you're the first of Lebron's token white guys to actually cash in on the manufactured hype. I don't dislike the guy but he'll be making the same per year as guys like Ibaka, Crowder, Dillon Brooks, Batum and a bunch of other guys who produce so much more than Caruso, sans Lebron and AD ever will."
"This is horseshit man. These new players  are weak af. You have fucking Brandon Ingram. You now have Valenciounas. Lebron had Ira newbill. The Pelicans are not in a bad place: if anything, Zion isn‚Äôt good enough. Stay in shape and play 82 games before you start the cliche ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have help‚Äô. How is Memphis better than you when Ja‚Äôs co-‚Äústar‚Äù is Dillon Brooks. Dearon Fox has a rookie Haliburton.   At the end of the day Zion‚Äôs fat ass isn‚Äôt good enough. He has no voice, he wants to start acting like a star but he‚Äôs still a shy quiet kid he doesn‚Äôt even remotely know how to lead a team. And that‚Äôs fine. But you cant have it both ways. How you mad your team hasn‚Äôt arrived when YOU haven‚Äôt arrived   His ‚Äúcamp‚Äù just wants a bigger market this has nothing to do with basketball."
"Grizzlies will probably want to see how well he plays after a full off season and a normal season schedule before they offer him an extension. Dillon Brooks signed his contract extension in February, 2.5 seasons into his original 3 year contract."
Dillon Brooks Julius Randle Zach LaVine Marcus Smart Christian Wood
Marcus Smart and Dillon Brooks might be the same player
"Oh it‚Äôs definitely the Memphis Grizzlies. Super young team that beat Golden State in the play in game and then lost to Utah in the second round. Memphis is building the team through the draft, they‚Äôve got star power in Ja Morant, the perfect freak athlete that slashes and pulls off amazing plays every night, destined for greatness. Jaren Jackson Jr is the 6‚Äô11 unicorn big that can stretch the floor: every team would kill to have him. Dillon Brooks is the dawg defender and has amazing offensive skills but super streaky. We got a new rookie that has tons of potential but could also be a dud, have to wait and see. A very sharp front office that doesn‚Äôt make too many mistakes. They nailed on almost all draft pics and trades the last three years."
"Ja Morant - Explosively athletic guard who can dunk well (fun to watch)  Jaren Jackson Jr - Big man who can shoot threes - due for a breakout season  Dillon Brooks - Lockdown defender but an extremely streaky shooter  Those are our 3 best players right now. We have one of the youngest teams in the league if not the youngest. We went 38-34 last season and made the playoffs as an 8th seed, so yes we are underdogs for now at least. Grit n Grind"
"They‚Äôre a pretty young team but they made the playoffs for the first time in a few years and have some serious young talent‚Äîincluding Ja Morant, who is basically on his way to becoming a superstar (averaged 30 points per game in his 1st playoff series), Dillon Brooks, who averaged 25 in the same series, and Jaren Jackson Jr. , affectionately known as ‚ÄúUnicorn‚Äù for his offensive and defensive potential. They‚Äôre definitely a rising team.  Their fanbase is very loyal and tight, they‚Äôre well-coached, and usually produce a lot of fan favorite players that get great favor in the NBA world. Very hardworking, not too showoffy or flashy either. I hardly hear anything negative about the Grizzlies, maybe nothing negative at all it seems."
"That 2017 draft doesn't just count as one mistake, it was a tremendous failure on multiple fronts. We had 3 first round picks and could've walked away with: John Collins (@ #15), Jarrett Allen/OG Anunoby (@ #20), and Kyle Kuzma/Derrick White/Josh Hart/Dillon Brooks (@ #26).  Or if we still made our trade of #15 + #20 for #10, we could have taken Bam Adebayo or Donovan Mitchell there.  Instead of getting any ONE of those players above, we walked away with Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan. And even if Zach Collins were healthy, he looks like a serviceable rotation player, not a star, and certainly not someone who would've pushed us to the next level. That draft was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster."
"Yup, that‚Äôs fine - but if Wiseman can‚Äôt get you Dillon Brooks, how the hell is he getting the warriors a championship impact player lol"
"Welp‚Ä¶we could see if Memphis is interested in Wiseman + Paschall for Dillon Brooks + Desmand Bane OR Kyle Anderson + Ziaire + Bane   Then look to trade Wiggins + Kuminga + a future pick(s) for Siakam   Steph / Klay / Brooks / Siakam / Dray  Poole / Bane / Moody / JTA / Looney  Fills the holes on the wing with Brooks + Siakam, keeps some ready to contribute youth in Poole, Bane and Moody  Target a center and backup pg with the TPMLE and vet mins  BUT as far as I can tell, Myers definitely talked to both Memphis and Toronto - so who knows whether these deals were discussed or even available"
"I agree, that wasn't commented towards you specifically, but just speaking in general of what i see in terms of general consensus (by upvotes as proxy) comments from dubs flairs. I didnt mean to put words in your mouth, so I apologize.   My comment to you was more ""how does he fit moreso than any other 3&amp;D guy does."" Like how would he fit you better than a Jeremi Grant type or a Dillon Brooks type or a Robert Covington type etc.  &gt; think you know team building math better than the FO of a championship team, so rock on.  That's just an appeal to authority argument not actually attacking the argument itself that results have been less than the sum of supposed variables. And I'm not inclined to believe its the Steph Curry variables part of the equation.  I dont think ""I know better"" I dont know what actual deals other teams were putting on the table, I just know Wiggins is fine, but hes not this special player people need to fawn over and thats just what I see on this sub. Sorry for seeing it I guess."
"For my team, Dillon Brooks would be able to play even more physically and his lack of range as a team defender is a bit less of a problem."
Dillon Brooks
"I used to not like Dillon Brooks, now he is grown on me. My guess is that will be most Grizz fans answer."
He goes full Chad Dillon Brooks on the Wolves every time.
"Death, Taxes, The Timberwolves, and god damn Dillon Brooks"
"That's a fair point, but I just feel with Jaren Jackson coming back that might be enough for y'all to get a pretty cozy 8th seed spot. Also Desmond Bane was getting busy in summer league so I think he's another plus for the Grizzlies along with Dillon Brooks.  I am high on Dame time, however judging from the Trailblazers off season moves...or lack thereof, I don't think they're that high on Dame time anymore. Dame and McCollum will give us what they normally do (until McCollum gets injured again), Norman Powell is good too. I also like that they added a bit more depth at the PF/C position in Larry Nance Jr and Cody Zeller since that seems to be where there injuries always tend to happen. However I feel like the Western Conference teams that are worth a damn made worthwhile moves/improvements while the Trailblazers kinda just put on a band-aid on a boo-boo that's getting infected now.  Spurs I completely forgot about them trading Derozan so yeah lemme get them outta there lmao"
"And when his best teammates are Giannis, Khash and Jrue instead of Ja and Dillon Brooks? Grayson Allen in a contract year? That guy might go nuts."
Trade Kuminga and Moody or something like that for Dillon Brooks and all of the sudden they have the best defense in the league.
Mvp: devin booker Dpoy: bam adebayo Mip: Dillon brooks
"Salary doesn‚Äôt work for Turner. I have been thinking more along the lines of Dillon Brooks, Lu Dort, TJ Warren, Sexton, Clarkson."
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."

Dillon Brooks for OJ Mayo? Nah I‚Äôll stick with Dillon.
"Add ""#ACCOUNTABILITY"" to lebron's resume, his dirty plays (Embiid, Ayton just past season), his flops all the time, especially when he gets close to Dillon Brooks for some reason.      Literally unless you're an antivaxxer or a criminal you're more likeable than lebron james."
"For us it‚Äôs either NAW or Hayes.  NAW has shown that he can be a good defender and can make tough shots. I think he‚Äôll be similar to Dillon Brooks next year.  Hayes is a legitimately good center, but he still makes stupid mistakes. He‚Äôs a good rebounder, rim protector and can even hit some shots outside the arc."
Damn people already forgot about Dillon Brooks... he had a pretty good season and stepped up huge in the play-in/playoff.
Dillon Brooks above Kennard imo.
"Seriously, it‚Äôs like they forgot Dillon Brooks was in this draft"
"Yeah, this is clearly bait, but other than Lonzo and Fox clearly needing to be switched (and maybe OG being a couple spots too low), the rest of the list is pretty decent.  Oh, and I'd probably take Dillon Brooks over everyone up to maybe Derrick White"
I'd take Lou Dort and Dillon Brooks over Beverley and Green.
"Dillon ""Chad"" Brooks would like a word"
My ideal trade would be for Dillon Brooks. If they are high on THT I could see it.

Dillon ‚ÄúWhere my hug at‚Äù Brooks
If I have to see Dillon Brooks stupid face again....
He might also be traded for a win now guy + a pick as well. I‚Äôd absolutely hate to see it but if like Dillon Brooks comes available or if a Jae Crowder type guy is out there you might make a move.

Was thinking the other day about how much I love our fan base. Pretty loyal and patient bunch. Tend to be knowledgeable. Kind of us against the world mentality. It‚Äôs why Dillon Brooks fits in so we‚Äôll.
"The two you mentioned + John Collins, Jarrett Allen, Josh Hart, Dillon Brooks, and Monte Morris are the other guys getting significant rotation play"
The fro and Dillon Brooks
"I would have OG, John Collins, jarrett Allen, Kuzma, Derrick white, and Dillon Brooks all on that list. In no particular order but they need to be acknowledged"
"I'm just saying it's a weird president to set. If Ja stays there for 10 years total and they're a fun playoff team but never get past the second round, does that mean his number gets retired? What about JJJ? Is Dillon Brooks getting his number retired if he stays there another 5 years?"
"I'd say another top 40ish player and then a bunch of good, competent role players who can make open shots and not embarrass themselves on D.  Jamal Murray  Reggie Bullock  Dillon Brooks  Lebron  Derrick Favors"
"I think for Steph, it's among FVV, Dillon Brooks, Russ, or Jrue  Why Russ? Coz he really defended Steph and held him to 18 points that ended his 11 game streak with 30+ points.  Dillon Brooks' defense on Steph during the play-in game made me mad lol.  Jrue - no question, can clamp you up full court.  FVV - 2019 finals even though Steph averaged 30/6/5"
LeBron is glad he edged out Dillon Brooks there
Idk how they‚Äôll fair without Jonas. He was their second best player in the playoffs. Dillon Brooks is pretty great.
Dillon Brooks
"Just a random thought on Dillon Brooks- I noticed looking at stats today that he led the league in fouls per game. I know per-game stats are for the birds and he was only 71st in per-36 fouls, but I wouldn't have predicted him to be the league leader. I haven't watched enough to know how many of his fouls are on jump shooters: but if the NBA is serious about officiating fouls differently this year, maybe he'll get more playing time since they're pretty much bringing back the same guard rotation."
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
You don't remember Dillon Brooks?
Dillon Brooks + Kyle Anderson + possibly more package.
Dillon Brooks is one helluva bullet
"How dense are you? Grizz were a below the cap team, with a majority of rookie and mid level contracts, so they had a lot of cap room and could afford to absorb some of these salaries in order to complete trades. The top 5 players in minutes last season combined for $47M which is almost as much as Curry/Russ/Harden are making this season alone. They don't have any players signed to large contracts yet so the FO has the flexibility to make trades like this and absorb dead contracts, unlike say, the Lakers/Nets would.   There were literally no tax implications and the only thing it did was limit FA signings, which as both a small market that doesn't traditionally attract FAs and as a young roster that wasn't set to compete right away, the Grizzlies realistic targets in FA were very small and the FO decided rather than overspending on mediocre targets they would focus on trading/drafting as their talent acquisition vehicles and have stated as much in interviews. Yes, they have had misses (Winslow, Josh Jackson) but they also have a lot of hits (Melton, Bane, Tillman, Clarke)  Iguodala was actually a fucking heist from our FO. They literally took on Iguodala and a basically unprotected 2024 1st rounder so the Warriors could S&amp;T for Russell and parted with no assets to do that. We insisted on trading Igudola because he refused to join the team in any capacity so they didn't get to work him out or anything, and there was still a trade market for him, as evidenced by Miami trading for him.  Winslow is really unfortunate but cost the Grizzlies nothing but expiring contracts (Iggy, Crowder, Hill) to acquire, so it was a no risk no reward play for a player everyone acknowledges is extremely talented. He was fully healthy and was literally going to make his season debut the day that Covid shut down the NBA. And then the practice before the Bubble started, he dislocated his hip. It sucks but the Grizz took a chance on him and it failed, but cost them no long term assets.  Dieng was an extremely solid backup big for the Grizzlies in 19/20, but in 20/21 we had drafted Tillman who was getting all of his minutes, so he requested to go to another team, so they did him a solid and waived him so he could pursue more playing time elsewhere.  Next time learn the context of moves before just listing salaries and laughing about them. It's a testament to the Grizzlies FO that they were able to field such a competitive team in the West without any major contracts and their highest paid player being Dieng. All while having the 2nd youngest roster in the NBA, their longest tenured player being Dillon Brooks with 4 seasons and retaining all of their future 1sts and acquiring 3 extra 1sts along the way."
"Seriously, where did that defense go? They went from holding Harden under 55 TS% in back-to-back years in the playoffs to one of the worst playoff defenses dare I say ever, in a matter of 2 years. They legit made Terance Mann and Dillon Brooks look like elite offensive players this past playoffs."
Dillon Brooks will be on an all defensive team in the next 3 years.
This is why they need a good wing defender. Dillon Brooks would be my target if I‚Äôm Utah. Royce is good but he‚Äôs still undersized and over matched when he picks up guys like PG13.
https://youtu.be/3TpbEwz4MG8  Here‚Äôs him getting the jumper off pull ups on Dillon Brooks.
&gt;Maybe mcdaniels could fetch dillon brooks.  That's a really nice one. Good job
"As a sixers fan I‚Äôd rather they keep mcdaniels. Notice the sixers will be lacking in big quality defenders without simmons, they were already too small off the bench this season. Maybe mcdaniels could fetch dillon brooks."
Mew: Danny Green Mewtwo: Dillon Brooks
"If I‚Äôm Memphis, Dillon Brooks is untouchable too."
"Curry was +4 and scored 4 more points on 1 less shot. Morant was -1.  Curry was doing this while getting trapped because he was playing alongside Wiggins (Averaged 19 pts), Green (Averaged 7 pts), Looney (Averaged 4 pts) and Kent Bazemore (Averaged 7 pts). Meanwhile, Warriors had to guard Dillon Brooks (Averaged 17 pts), Valanciunas (Averaged 17 pts), Jackson Jr. (Averaged 14 pts) and Kyle Anderson (Averaged 12 pts)."
Why would grizzlies trade Dillon Brooks for that after his showing in the playoffs?
Dillon Brooks. I‚Äôm a try hard on defense and shoot too much.
Dillon Brooks on the Jazz would be so nice. A lineup of Conley/Mitchell/Dillon/Ingles/Gobert would be amazing. Then you can swap Conley out and insert Royce and play Mitchell at point for more Defense.
"I like Dillon brooks a lot and he showed his potential in the first round, is Memphis really not going to pay him"
"If it helps, the players I've seen described this way are Keldon Johnson, Dillon Brooks, and Kawhi Leonard. Maybe Giannis too."
The Memphis Grizzlies traded away their best player and are looking to offload Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks will not be winning 41 games. Especially since they also traded away Grayson Allen.  Everything they've done has signaled that they want to tank
Could be completely wrong  1.	Cam Johnson 2.	Siakam? 3.	DeRozan 4.	Dillon Brooks  5.	2016 Draymond 6.	Zion
"i could understand kyle anderson, but why would they wanna trade dillon brooks? isn‚Äôt he really essential to their core?"
That's Chad Dillon Brooks to you
Stay away from our Chad Dillon Brooks!
"Buddy hield had another down year, tyrese was a rookie, Barnes was good, and Holmes was good. Jonas and Dillon Brooks were better than all those guys last year. Kyle Anderson and Grayson Allen are solid role players, and all those grizzlies players didn‚Äôt have the burden of getting to be coached by the worst coach in the entire league. So no they are not on par with each other."
"Buddy Hield, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes and Richaun Holmes is on par with Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Jonas Valanciunus and Kyle Anderson"
You say that as if Jonas V and Dillon Brooks are top 75 players in the league lol  Fox wouldn't have been able to take down Curry in the play in
"while this is a solid person on the list, using a single 5-game segment to describe dillon brooks is asanine lol - dude is really streaky"
"Love the post. MIP is probably the most challenging of all the awards to predict because you're basically asking, Who do I expect to surprise me the most?   NAW is a good bet. Like the thought behind it.   I'll throw one other name out there that I think could be a nice sleeper bet: Dillon Brooks  He could likely be the recipient of more touches and shots w/ the absence of JV. The only thing thats holding him back is his shot selection. If he cleans that up a bit, I could see him having a Randle-like year where everything goes right."
Dillon Brooks avg 11.6 million per season and just averaged 26 ppg in a playoff series
"Wait... is this a giant troll thread by Grizz fans to pump Dillon Brooks' trade value? When did everyone start seeing Dillon Brooks as a desirable trade asset? He is below average as a 3-pt shooter and an average defender at absolute best... just about all the advanced stats out there say he's complete garbage (yes yes, I know advanced stats don't tell the whole story). But he doesn't even pass the eye test - he's a chucker with poor shot selection. I genuinely don't know if he has one above average skill besides maybe shot-creation. Kyle Anderson is better at just about everything.  What am I missing???"
17 a night with solid defence? Sounds like a slightly worse Brooks. Especially when you consider the warriors are cash strapped and his salary is 20 million higher than Brooks. Dillon just averaged 25 in his first playoffs and can legitimately clamp down opposing stars.
Dillon Brooks is a bucket
Someone who‚Äôs a Dillon brooks away from winning a championship might. If I‚Äôm Utah I‚Äôd give up 2 first for him (they won‚Äôt unless they‚Äôre dumping salary too). Denver would. Philly probably would if they end up keeping Simmons. Obviously Dallas and Portland would consider it as well even though that wouldn‚Äôt push them over the top.
"We‚Äôre missing arguably our best backcourt defender in a backcourt predominant league in Dillon Brooks. And whether you think him or Kyle Anderson is the better defender, DB is def our defensive heart. Not gonna say we‚Äôre gonna magically get great on defense, but DB is def missed"
"Dillon ""evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
"The Grizz' best defender Brooks has been out with injury. When Dillon ""the Villain"" returns from injury, Melton likely moves to the second team, rebuilding the potent Melton-Jones-Clarke-Anderson quartet, and that improves team defense.  Team shooting percentage likely drops as well when he returns."
Pretty sure their defense will improve when Dillon Brooks return
Dillon Brooks is death incarnate and comes to Minnesota to reap souls.
"While I hate to compliment the guy, Dillon Brooks would probably have smashed some heads together and gotten his guys to ignore the extra curriculum of the game and focus up."
"I'll never get why players take such offense to this.  Hell, I remember when Coach K called out Dillon Brooks in the NCAA tournament for taking a garbage time 3."
"Yes, Dillon Brooks is the most recent incarnation of this two decade long phenomenon."
"You mean dillon brooks, he's literally Steph Curry combined with Kobe vs the wolves"
"Portland could sure use him! And Payton Pritchard. And Dillon Brooks. Maybe some Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell as well.  If I'm gonna watch us get blown out by 30 points, I can at least watch my Ducks get minutes!"
"Once Dillon ""Villain"" Brooks returns, I think Ja's usage rates and minutes will dip, and overall his efficiency will come back to earth a bit. That could still end up raising his ppg to 25-27 pts per game. Hopefully he maintains his 3 pt shooting at least at a high 30s percentage."
"Dillon fucking Brooks fake hard ass, hate his try hard fucking style of play, he‚Äôa going to hurt someone  Same with Bertans, he‚Äôs reckless when he pushes too hard on D"
"Why should Zion buy in for a team that isn‚Äôt going to buy in for him? Multiple coaches, keep wasting assets to bring in centers that don‚Äôt fit.   All the guys you listed and claim have less help? Full of fucking shit. Ja morant has jjj, Dillon brooks and plenty of other guys who actually fit with him and help him. Zions only running mate is a fringe all star guy who‚Äôs play style doesn‚Äôt even fit.     So I‚Äôll repeat: if you can‚Äôt actually build a team around a generational talent because you‚Äôre too stupid to trade for players that fit then that‚Äôs 100% on you. Even lebron in his first cavs stint was getting shooters or defenders around him that fit his play style even if they sucked"
I remember him completely flop in front of Dillon Brooks
"I fucking knew Bane was going to be a stud. I think he‚Äôll stick around in the starting lineup when Dillon Brooks comes back. Melton has been great too, but Bane is a better defender and has better size."
Win doesn't count. Grizzlies are playing back to back. And also Dillon Brooks didn't play. Gotta move the goalpost or whatever make the haters sleep at night lol
Lol either we‚Äôre a top four seed in the west once Dillon brooks comes back or the lakers are barely a playoff team. But no one wants to admit either of those could be true
JJJ honestly doesn‚Äôt seem hungry for wins. I don‚Äôt know how else to say it. He is talented but I want to see the dog in him I see in Ja and Dillon Brooks.
JJJ honestly doesn‚Äôt seem hungry for wins. I don‚Äôt know how else to say it. He is talented but I want to see the dog in him I see in Ja and Dillon Brooks.
Low key Melo always ruins Memphis and nobody outside of Memphis would have noticed that. He killed us when he was on Portland.   I actually think Dillon Brooks pissed him off one game and he never forgave us for that.
Dillon brooks back and Kyle Anderson not playing like gutter trash will solve the bench issue. Lakers specifically give the Grizz backup bigs problems with their size.
"Missing Dillon Brooks and on a SEGABABA. You‚Äôve been warned, league."
Grizzlies on a SEGABABA without Dillon Brooks and Lakers with the zebras and still one possession with a minute left‚Ä¶
Dillon Brooks angered Melo a few years ago and he still takes it out on us
Still missing Dillon Brooks too
"MVP: Ja Morant  ROTY: Ziaire Williams  DPOY: Dillon Brooks  6MOY: Desmond Bane/De'Anthony Melton  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr.  Champion: Memphis Grizzlies (82-0, 16-0)"
I miss Dillon Brooks. Great game from PG.
I love Dillon Brooks man. Saw him play for the first time  in the playoffs last season and he was one of the biggest standouts. Just saw your flair and wanted to say my peace.
"Memphis fans, do you reckon there is chance when Brooks returns he's moved to the bench in a 6th man role? I think Grizzlies lack that sparking plug that Dillon could really provide in the second unit."
You guys should trade whatever you can for Dillon Brooks
"Mordant, JJJ, Kyle Anderson, Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Melton there you go"
Dillon Brooks is called Chad in our sub for a reason. I miss him so much can't wait to bust out his Isaac Hayes jersey from last year
Agreed I love watching the grizzlies between him and Dillon brooks irrational confidence lol
Nwora reminds me of Dillon Brooks. Two-way wing with irrational confidence.
I STILL FUCKING HATE DILLON BROOKS
Losing Valanciunas definitely hurts them. Steven Adams isn't anywhere near the offensive threat JVal was. However Jaren Jackson missed most of the season and he adds another dimension to their team. I know expecting him to stay healthy is a stretch but the potential is there. Ja is still a killer and they have good role players like Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson
"Good chance he starts most of the season, but even then he‚Äôll be our 5th option and splitting time with several other similarly or not much less talented guys at that position. Which is basically what he was doing in Memphis but instead of sharing touches with Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks and Valanciunas he‚Äôs gotta do it with Giannis and Middleton and Jrue."
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
"Look at how absolute shit our drafting was from Conley till JJJ.  2008: Kevin Love (5th overall) who was traded immediately for OJ Mayo. OJ wasn't bad per-se, but he wasn't great. Donte Green (28th overall) was traded immediately to Houston for the rights to Darrell Arthur in a 3-team trade. Arthur was ok.  2009: Hasheem Thabeet (2nd overall) was trash. Demarre Carroll (27th overall) was below average on the Grizz and found a decent role later on. Sam Young (2nd round, 36th overall) was below average.  2010: Xavier Henry (12th overall) was trash. Dominique Jones (25th overall) was traded to Dallas for the GOAT Cash Considerations. Greivis Vasquez (28th overall) decent backup PG who we traded to Toronto later on.  2011: Josh Selby (49th overall) was trash.  2012: Tony Wroten (25th overall) was traded to the 76ers after one season and was on the team during the Process years if that's any indication for how he turned out.   2013: Jamaal Franklin (41st overall) played in 24 career games and has been playing in China since 2014. Janis Timma (60th overall) never played in the NBA.  2014: Jordan Adams (22nd overall) was always injured and played in 32 career games.   2015: Jarrell Martin (25th overall) was out of the league as his play style was quickly lost with the 3-ball revolution.  2016: Wade Baldwin (17th overall) was too cocky and never made an impact. Cut from Memphis after 1 season. Wang Zhelin (57th overall) has never played in the NBA.   2017: No draft picks! Did trade for Dillon Brooks on draft night though.   Seriously, that drafting is absolutely awful. Went a full decade without a single guy being even a role player."
"Maybe next year DA like play with JJJ, Dillon Brooks ans Ja ?  Yes? Maybe he like. See you soon. All be happy bye bye"
I would honestly take Dillon Brooks as a wing defender over any of them.
Dillon Brooks vs Patrick Beverly
just dont make us play the hell demon dillon brooks.
I'll take the team with Dillon Brooks
Imagine if Memphis gave Dillon Brooks a max.
"Both guys have hardly played.   And look at previous years...   Terrance Mann, Horton-Tucker, Eric Paschell, Bruce Brown, Diallo, Svi Mykhailluk, Shake Milton, Monte Morris, Dillon Brooks, Thomas Bryant...   These guys are actually playing minutes and were drafted in the 40s/50s. Its not that unusual."
Dillon Brooks was great last season
"Ok, question:  &gt;!Is ‚ÄúVillain Brooks‚Äù an acceptable answer for the ‚ÄúDillon Crooks‚Äù one?!&lt;"
Goddamn Dillon Brooks
Thank God Dillon Brooks held on through the small window between Grit N Grind and the advent of Grizz Next Gen.  Those few years in between were rough.
"Dillon Brooks? Bro, what are you on?"
those 2-way players not 3&amp;D players. They do way more than shoot 3s on offense. And Dillon Brooks shoots 34% from 3 bro.
PG?kawhi?Tatum? Dillon Brooks?
Dillon Brooks is gonna be a demon. He averages 4 of these fouls a game
"Irrational confidence is a 2-edged sword for a 2 guard.   See Brooks, Dillon."
"Yeah it was tough to not have Shai, Jamal, Dillon Brooks (among several others) available. Really looking forward to see what our 2024 squad can do"
Dillon Brooks
Um Ja made the playoffs in the west with Dillon brooks as his second best player. You don‚Äôt think Ja and Beal could do it in the east?
"Jaren missed almost all of last season. If he plays well, they could be about as good or even better than last season. Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Jaren Jackson, Desmond Bane, Steven Adams, and Brandon Clarke is a decent core. Definitely not great and they could miss the playoffs pretty easily especially with the warriors presumably being better but they're a decent team."
"I‚Äôll go very slightly off topic and say the rule change will impact on ball defenders the most. Yes, you‚Äôll see a drop in points from good shooters. But there‚Äôs a lot of active on ball defenders, like Dillon Brooks for example, who found themselves on the bench in late game and clutch situations because of foul trouble. If enforced correctly, elite scorers and shooters could find themselves guarded much more fiercely in the clutch because there‚Äôll be good on ball defenders not in late game foul trouble because of this rule."
"idk, I'd put SGA, Wiggins, and jamal murray above him. Then you have Dort and RJ Barrett. Imo, he's fighting for 6th at best, with dudes like Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, and (if he makes a jump) NAW."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"JJJ is the third option, and Dillon Brooks&gt;CJ"
Dillon Brooks did dunk on Giannis.
Fav: Wayne Ellington Least Fav: Dillon Brooks
This dude really said Dillon Brooks was y‚Äôall best player my head is fuckin spinning
Go to any non playoff team and try to get their best veterans.  Harrison Barnes. Dillon Brooks. Kyle Anderson. Thad Young. Derrick White. Etc. you could get a legit starter. A 6th man. And a big to fill the roster.
Dillon Brooks
"In a mock offseason recently, I traded Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson for Danilo Gallinari, 2 unprotected 1st round picks, 2 future 1st round pick swaps, and 2 unprotected 2nd round picks and people hated it."
jalen green is top 5 imo. thats one pretty mfer. idk bout mile bridges or dillon brooks tbh
You guys think my list is valid? 1) serge ibaka  2) kelly oubre  3) paul george  4) jayson tatum  5) gordon hayward  6) Sga  7) Kawhi leonard  8) zach lavine  9) dillon ‚Äúchad‚Äù brooks  10) kyrie irving
Danny green and Evil Danny Green (Dillon Brooks)
nah dillon brooks
"I'd like to like Dillon Brooks but god he's hard to watch play, even on a foul that was really a foul that diving performance yikes."
Dillon Brooks is great at basketball but jesus christ that hair.
Dillon Brooks has entered the chat
I just don't see Wood as that guy...I know warriors has many wings already but Dillon Brooks is playoff tested and on a similar contract... I'd rather trade for him
"There aren‚Äôt any rules about long-term injury reporting. The rules about game to game injury reporting are very easy to follow.   Just look at the injury reporting on Dillon Brooks, for one example.   His off-season hand injury was never reported and it took people noticing he was literally wearing a cast on the sideline at a workout for anyone to find out about it.   Then when that was noticed the team reported that he was ‚Äúexpected to be ready for camp.‚Äù   Then that turned into ‚Äúoh yeah he broke his hand over the summer, no big deal, he‚Äôs fully back now.‚Äù   Then that turned into ‚Äúactually he‚Äôs not ready for camp and he will be out 2 to 3 more weeks.‚Äù   Then that turned into ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to miss to the start of the season, no timeline for return, going to be reevaluated in 2 to 3 weeks.‚Äù   Then there was basically no follow up until he was randomly listed as a game time decision for the game on November 11th which he returned for."
It makes sense then if they were trying to package Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen for a better wing - they need one to pair with Ja for the future.  Ziaire Williams will hopefully be that but he's raw as hell. Memphis traded up in the draft with the JV trade but apparently they were hoping for either Giddey or Wagner.
"Memphis really gave away Grayson allen and Valanciunas in the same offseason, and there were rumours about trading Dillon brooks lmao"
Meh they kept Jaren and Winslow out for months after a reasonable time table for return. Same with Dillon Brooks. We just play it safe with injuries and probably wouldn't disclose them if we weren't forced to.

"Damn, I am worse than Bill Simmons trying to recruit Dillon Brooks to the US team.  I fucked that up."
"If the Grizzlies beat the Suns in a game where Dillon Brooks has 33% usage, we should take it as a sign of the apocalypse."
FVV &amp; Dillon Brooks in recent years
"The other thing guys like FVV and Dillon Brooks and the Ty Lue finals teams did so well was they played so physical to the point of constantly fouling. But if you foul so often the refs won't call it every time, especially off ball."
Which team is a better question. When teams play box and one against you no single defender can stop you. As far as individual defenders go Dillon Brooks does a good job and Chris Paul always turns it up against Curry. Seth Curry and Avery Bradley also do pretty well. Jrue is typically a good defender but Steph always lights him up.

Dillon Brooks and current Lebron
"Nah.. that‚Äôs not it. We were implementing a new defensive scheme for like the first 5-7 games of the season where we would have the center play out at the level of the screen.  Now we‚Äôre just grasping at straws. The only time our defense looks acceptable is when Nassir and Nance are out there together. Nurk is having one of his best seasons as a rim protector, but there‚Äôs not much he can do out there. Even if he shuts off the basket an open three is usually just one pass away.  Even if we had a defensive mastermind like Popovic or Nurse running the show it‚Äôs not like we have the personnel to execute some inventive scheme.  We‚Äôve traded three consecutive first round picks to surround our guards with two of the best defensive forwards in the game. According to RAPTOR we have a top 3 defensive center (I don‚Äôt actually believe that, but Nurk is top 7ish for sure). At this point it‚Äôs very clear that the problem is the backcourt.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible to build a mediocre defense around Dame and CJ, but you just need one guy who can guard the opponents best player. We need an Alex Caruso or a Gary Trent or a Dillon Brooks. That way we could at least hide Dame and CJ on worse offensive players."

i love playing against dillon brooks. guy has the basketball iq of a brick
"Dillon Brooks and Joe Ingles come to mind.    Booker, Butler, Embiid, KD, Draymond are all up there too."
Davion mitchell  Gary trent jr dillon brooks draymond green clint capela
"&gt;Dillon Brooks  No offense to grizzlies fans because I adore Ja, but Brooks is so annoying to watch."
He ate up Dillon Brooks' shot attempt in the Grizzlies game the other night while Chris Boucher ended up on SportsCenter getting dunked on. Saw a good clip asking why Chris Boucher not contesting a dunk is a 'good business decision' while Yuta gets up and tries his best on D and gets no reward for it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spxqhO3u-ok   Tell me you don't watch Raps games without telling me you don't watch Raps games.
"As a grizzlies fan, Dillon Brooks. The man has great passion and certainly an important role on the team, but he oversteps his bounds constantly.  He chucks shots like he thinks he's Steph Curry, and while he'll blow up occasionally, more often than not he has a mediocre inefficient line. His defense is great, and he has an OK shot, but he's not even our third best option, and he can be a ball hog in clutch moments when Ja should be taking charge."
Dillon Brooks strikes me as the type of player that you love if he is on your team and absolutely hate if is on the opposing team.
Other teams need to learn how to exist in unison and simply shitpost about Dillon Brooks regardless of the result
Holy shit thts the exact same spot + rotation as the ant dunk.  Dillon brooks -figuratively- dunks on wolves every time.  Ant dunks on yuta last yr.  Nov 24: Dillon gets blocked by yuta Ant dunks on someone else   some form of passing of the baton is going on
"If there‚Äôs one thing the Miami Heat and it‚Äôs players are the best at, it‚Äôs giving the other team bulletin board material:  Between Jimmy and the Wolves, Iguodala and the Grizz/Dillon Brooks, Kieff generally being a dipshit, it feels like the team the past few years have riled up opponents and given them more motive to stick it to them on the court."
Yuta got his redemption today! Rejected a Dillon Brooks dunk attempt
Even Dillon Brooks was pumped up for the block lol
I think Dillon Brooks shoots better at contested 3s than open 3s
"Yuta redeemed himself 20 mins ago by blocking Dillon Brooks dunk, and now Ant posters someone else. The curse has been passed on"
"Gotta love the Team Canada action tonight with Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke and ofc Banton and Boucher"
"monstars?  patrick beverley, dillon brooks, pj tucker, the morris brothers, bol bol  players who play hard and generally resemble monsters, and then a goofy ass tall dude"
"The fact that no one has mentioned Dillon Brooks is bullshit. He's averaged 26ppg last playoffs. The Mississauga Mamba, remember the name."
Dillon Brooks sent em home
"It's very rare, if other teams were brigading. I'd expect the entire frontpage of r/warriors to have pictures of Dillon Brooks and FVV smiling together every time we lost"
Dillon Brooks. Dude has the drive to take him a long way past his natural abilities. Just loves hooping and will be able to fit into most teams even after his prime
I hope Dillon Brooks never wins anything
Dillon Brooks
Ja JJJ Dillon Brooks Bane Melton Ziaire Clarke Adams  Could go with either Tillman or Slowmo over Adams but not sure
‚ÄúAspires to be‚Äù. Saying Dillon Brooks ‚Äúinspires‚Äù millions would be accepted as well
Dillon Brooks is who LeBron James inspires to be obviously.
"last year was ‚Äúum, so who the fuck is dillon brooks and who does he think he is?‚Äù üòÇ"
"I hope Z picks up notes from Brooks. If he can play like Dillon does minus the fouling, he will be the wing we needed since Grit N Grind. Yes Brooks can play SF but he can also play SG. Ziaire is a pure SF."
"FVV + Brooks are the best Curry hounds, but they (Dillon specifically) tends to foul out"
Real fans know that we only won because the Grizzlies didn‚Äôt have Dillon Brooks
dillon brooks
"I mean we want the stars talking shit, not Dillon brooks"
"To the contrary, it wouldn't be such a Dillon Brooks moment without the hat."
Bro Dillon Brooks does not know you exist.   You don‚Äôt need to defend his clothing honour on reddit.
Forbidden bunny Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks learned a something from Pat Bev during his very short time with the Grizz
I kinda get that. I can't stand Dillon Brooks for no reason other than guy can't seem to miss against us.
I think that was the case when Dillon was injured. But now these last two games we‚Äôve gone to that Jaren and Brooks + Bench lineup a ton and it‚Äôs been great.
Not necessarily. You can be selfish chucker on offense and play good defense. Dillon Brooks is another example
"Eric Gordon, FVV, Dillon Brooks have all done nice jobs guarding Curry in big occasions in the past."
Dillon Brooks definitely.
Ricky Rubio like 5 yrs ago would do a good job. Now days....uhh Fred Van Vleet? Dillon Brooks? Idk
he just death stares dillon brooks on a catch and shoot 3 and Brooks misses
"I think Middleton already proved himself lmao  You're probably looking for Malik Beasley, Bagley or Dillon Brooks type of player who wants to prove something"
"Don't forget 45th pick Dillon Brooks averaging 21.5 ppg (I will hear nothing about number of games played, thank you)."
I feel like this is Dillon Brooks.
"Adams is more versatile and mobile, but JV is way better in the drop scheme that Jenkins loves to run. Plus Grayson Allen was kind of underrated as a defender, he looks shitty but he's actually got long arms and he works really hard getting over screens. And finally, for most of this season Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson haven't started, they were very important to last season's defense."
Dillon Brooks is the worst player when factoring in his playtime and role. Nobody who gets to touch the ball as much as him is as bad. I just hate watching him play.
Dillon Brooks is a blessing for my fantasy team ü•∞
Dillon Brooks.
"&gt; I never compared him to an all star. Please work on your reading comprehension skills. I used him as an example of a valuable player being traded for literally free. My point being if you actually want to pull off trades and pay the price for the trade, it can actually happen. Your FO didn‚Äôt even attempt that which they said themselves.  Your logic skills are lacking if you believe that using a bench player as an example that bonafide all stars are available even makes sense. There were none available because most all-stars are either trying to make the playoffs or ask out in the offseason.   &gt; No trade is ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù until it happens hence the constant meming that goes around them once a trade happens. There are multiple players available if you actually want to make a trade happen, for example Pacers and Grizzlies just to name some teams have log jams at certain positions and are in stuck in a 8-9 seed range.  Are any of those available players all-stars? That‚Äôs speaking pretty highly of Dillon Brooks and Myles Turner. Neither of those players would have been traded at the middle of last season and neither would you take at the #2 ovr pick so why the heck would you trade a #2 ovr pick for them? That‚Äôs just bad business and you‚Äôll regret the deal for the rest of your GM career.   No he actually had a stronger first half of the season offensively lol. **The issue was his defence and decision making was terrible**  Which got better before he was hurt. Started realizing his role and fouling less.   &gt; It‚Äôs wild how the Warriors were clearly so much better with him off the court by literally all metrics even including basic win loss yet you can‚Äôt accept the fact they would‚Äôve been better with an all star or high end role player instead.  I won‚Äôt accept the fact that they‚Äôd be better with an All-star player because there weren‚Äôt any available. You‚Äôd most likely be happier with a billion dollars but as of right now it‚Äôs not feasible you‚Äôll get it. As for a high end role player maybe. But here‚Äôs the point. Does that role player win us a play-in game? That is unknown because the team choked both those games. Do they win against the Jazz with that role player? Definitely not. Does that role player make them win 3-4 more games? I don‚Äôt believe so because we still have Oubre(who was a fairly high end role player in his own right before he came), Bazemore, and Wanamaker. Does that role player win us a playoff series? I say no. So if that role player doesn‚Äôt win you a series last year. For CERTAIN doesn‚Äôt get you to the WCF, and they really don‚Äôt increase your odds all that much the next season, and by year 3-4 Wiseman could be passing them already, why would you do that deal? If the player you acquire isn‚Äôt worth taking #2 ovr in the draft then don‚Äôt trade the #2 ovr draft pick for him. It‚Äôs that simple going win-now doesn‚Äôt all of a sudden make you do brain dead moves that you‚Äôll answer for down the line."
It‚Äôs bad and it‚Äôs really bad sans Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks begs to differ
"No Dillon Brooks until tonight, they are 28th in defense to start."
No Dillon brooks until this game and reduced kyle anderson minutes are a big part of it
"sell: Warriors (stupid easy schedule to begin the szn), Wizards (overperformed early)  buy: Grizzlies (Dillon Brooks coming back, schedule is easing up), Bucks"
Wearing my Dillon Brooks jersey to the Forum tonite to summon his Chad energy
Dillon Brooks gonna be even more of a pest.... I can't wait! (He might even be back tonight)
"mostly because thats literally all we do.  The First 3 years of KAT were so promising.  He hasn't done one iota to elevate his game since, and now is able to be boxed out and out positioned by Ja Morant, let alone Dillon Brooks.  Its so freaking embarassing, actually.   I don't want to rebuild, but we didn't really need a good sample size to know how flawed this roster was.  As excited as I am for Gupta, hashtag giddy4gupta, I just want to bottom out, trade everything but Jaden, Ant, Naz, and Bolmaro and get Banchero.  Its like he think he's this certain type of player, but he's just a glorified Lauri Markkennan and its really fucking disturbing watching him play these days.  Everything is just so difficult for him.  He also chooses to NEVER make the simple play.  I fucking hate it, and minny is growing very sour on KAT."
lmao dillon brooks
Grizz didn‚Äôt have Dillon Brooks.
I mean you have seen our defense first hand lol. We're also missing one of our best players in Dillon Brooks on top of still being incredibly young with room to grow. Look at the age of all our rotation players and you'll see why they're still learning to play to the best of their abilities. Plus look at our schedule. We haven't had it easy and being 6-4 is actually pretty good
Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen are not dirty players  Grayson def was in college but Dillon never has been
This guy knows he has Dillon Brooks on his team *and* used to have Grayson Allen lmao
The Dillon Brooks experience is a roller coaster.
Beating the Wolves without Dillon Brooks who is a Wolves-killer is shocking.   Clarke had a great bounce back game. Happy to see him play well.
Dillon Brooks gave his Wolves killer abilities to Clarke lmaoooo
I miss Dillon Brooks
"Because the team would be even better this season? Doesn't have to be a superstar, just an above average starter like Dillon brooks, FVV, Christian Wood, Olynk or Turner."
You mean Dillon Brooks?
Melton sadly gonna end up back on the bench when Dillon brooks returns
"He almost definitely won't. His 3-pt and FT% are already beginning to stabilize back closer to his career averages.  Once Dillon Brooks comes back, Ja will drop a few Usage points and minutes."
"Eh, if Ja Morant is on his A game and Dillon Brooks is back, you all are just as good, if not better. Brooks defends Beal as well as any player I‚Äôve seen."
Real fans know that Dillon Brooks is the real Foul God on the Grizzlies
"&gt; They drafted Lydon who i wouldn't have drafted with the 60th pick. How come these proffesional front office geniuses with much better scouting and information than me fucked that up?  Dunno what to tell you there. Teams will reach for a gamble with their late 1st. Nothing is guaranteed at that point whatsoever. You can confirm this with how many players drafted after him are out of the league, it is almost all of them. They had some sort of intel that told them that maybe this was a little bit better of a gamble than others. Of the ones who are still in the league now only Kyle Kuzma, Derrick White, and Dillon Brooks are starters. Not exactly guys anyone thought to pick either.  Luckily Denver also found Monte Morris late in that draft who is now the best back up PG in the league.  &gt; Giving Jamal the contract a year early your risk is fairly high while the reward is at least comparable as giving him the contract a year later . Giving him the contract a year later your risk is clearly much lower while the reward is roughly the same if not bigger. Surely you agree with this.  No, I don't agree with this because I've followed the NBA long enough and have seen enough lousy rookie/RFA/UFA situations to know that if you think your player will be worth that, then give it to them. Countless times they wait a year and it sours the player, it says to other players we are going to make you wait to get contract security as long as we possibly can, we want to wait for you not to get injured another year before we commit to you, and when they go to RFA they get to hear from other teams how much that team values them, how the team they're on didn't give them the max but that they would have, that they're going to do everything that their other team can't do if their team doesn't match the max. Whether or not they end up staying with the team, that has a huge impact on someone in their early 20s.   Again, this isn't 2K, the human element in this is a huge deal. That's why all these teams secure their guy a year early. It's not like the ""logic"" and math isn't obvious. It's that it's clearly outweighed by the negatives, considering if the player plays the exact same as they did the last year you're gonna give it to them anyway."
When's Dillon Brooks scheduled to come back?
"2 or 3 dumb turnovers would have made up the margin for sure, but y'all capitalized on it. I'm honestly more afraid of the Grizz now than any other team in the West, especially with Dillon Brooks coming back and JJJ looking to have progressed his game."
"I'm not high on DLo either but I'd say he's at least as good as the Grizzlies 2nd best player Dillon Brooks (who is out right now btw).  I love the team we're putting out there but from a talent perspective we shouldn't be nearly as good as we are and that's all thanks to Ja and the organization.  I will give the wolves a pass since they had a ton of injuries last year but its always something with that team dating back to the ""spooky wolves"" days"
"Dillon Brooks being out these 8 games has had an impact on stats. Dillon shoots a lot but he also spaces the floor and opens up the lane a bit.   Brooks also disrupts defensively and can get the ball in transition, opening up more chances for open floor highlights (except when they ‚Äútake‚Äù foul)"
Any team with Dillon brooks will murder us
"i wonder how much is just him taking dillon brooks shots  not hating or anything, hes playing like a boss, but his shooting splits are actually down hes just shooting a lot more"
Jokic is such a fucking legend. Good JJJ games are the best things ever. 2nd is a good Dillon Brooks game though.
Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks looks like Danny Green's evil brother
Dillon Brooks is gonna drop a 30 piece I already know
"I try to use BClarke when I'm outside of the Grizz sub, but commonly Grizzlies fans in our subreddit speak about players in 3 letters or less.  Ja, JV, JJJ, BC, DB  And DB is the MOST confusing because we all know DB is Dillon Brooks but now we have Desmond Bane as well"
I wonder if Dillon Brooks is in the same position as Oubre is if that trade goes through.

"Dillon Brooks as PG is brutal. Not much grizz can do as Tyus can‚Äôt play all 48 mins, but have to get in transition every time to score or else every shot will be Dillon."
Yeah he sucks. Watching him and Dillon Brooks play each other is hilarious
Dillon Brooks would like a word

f\*ck dillon brooks no you who i hate on the Grizzlies soo much...No not ja its annoying ass Kyle anderson i hate him so much my god
"Fans of a team are aboslutely within their rights to beg and plead for their stars to stay and wait for success. I know I feel that way about our high tier roleplayers like Ja and Jaren, and our superstar dillon brooks.  But if you're a neutral fan or a fan of another team, there's no reason why you can't want to see great players leave bad teams to increase the level of competition among the good teams.   It isn't like they're the pistons, who have a good player who wants to be the first option and won't be elsewhere, and are rebuilding after picking up some good players who didn't work out."
"Their team is one of the only teams in the league that hasn‚Äôt gone all in on the whole ‚Äúlive by the 3, die by the 3,‚Äù having a ton of guys that play old school just contested hard basketball. They make a ton of 2‚Äôs, primarily to JV and Ja, and Dillon Brooks is their shot chucker Kobe type player who‚Äôll either be really hot or really cold. Their defense is really good, so my guess on their position in the league atm is that most teams aren‚Äôt really adapted to dealing with the interior barrage that the Grizz go for. They make a lot of points off of turnovers, have a great transition game, and their overall scrappiness makes them tough to guard. Their rookies in Bane and Tillman have been really solid, serving as great backups. Their coach is also pretty decent too."
Nah I mean Slowmo taking 6 3s and playing Dillon Brooks instead of Chad Brooks
No apparent reason? Shit. That‚Äôs hard. Dillon Brooks I guess?
Dillon Brooks
Honorary mention for Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks is 6'7 but looks so small next to Giannis. (This is because Giannis is significantly taller.)
"Even just on the Grizzlies, Dillon Brooks was a late second round pick who played 3 years in college and only got serious minutes because we were tanking or we were just a bad team and he was nothing like the player he is today. Player development and putting players in positions to succeed is hugely underrated in the nba where almost everyone is insanely talented. I mean just look at how lebron transforms undesirable players into contributing role players on contenders every single year."
The Dillon Brooks Chris Wallace days....
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
Chad dillon brooks
"Dillon Brooks is officially my favourite Grizzlies player right now. When he's hot, we're really hard to beat"
I must not fear the Deer. The Deer is the mind-killer. Deer is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my Deer. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the Deer has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain-Dillon Brooks
There's nothing anyone could say to turn me against Dillon Brooks.  Dude was the only fun grizzlies player in 17-18 and he's playing fucking incredibly on a playoff team in the west.
Dillon Brooks might be passing JJJ as my fav player and Im scared

Lots of folks wanna blame Grayson Allen for the loss against the Mavs but Dillon Brooks shot us out of that game.
I didn't watch the game but I'm in here to talk about Dillon motherfn' Brooks
My boy Dillon Brooks gets roasted on the Grizzlies IG page relentlessly.. even if the posts aren‚Äôt about him üòÇ
"Dillon Brooks easily. Dude has just been good this year, and a hell of a defender."
"Yes, and that‚Äôs just because everyone loves to hate Trae. Let that be LBJ or Luka and Grayson getting death threats and shit. I love the Grizzlies team but fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks"
I don‚Äôt think other fan bases realize that at heart Dillon brooks is a defensive specialist.
Dillon ‚Äú6/19‚Äù Brooks
Dillon Brooks and whoever else the Grizzlies had on the perimeter the other night looked like the best defense in the league by the eye test.   Might be hitting their stride

Dillon Brooks
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..

... Tobias Harris lit up the Wizards and Dillon Brooks was the leading scorer for the Griz... But your point still stands.
Meanwhile Dillon Brooks literally headbut Conley and nobody gives a shit.
"I‚Äôm not bothered, Steph is fun but the rest of the Warriors not so much, meanwhile the Grizzlies are packed with entertaining players. I don‚Äôt wanna watch Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins when I could watch Dillon Brooks and JJJ instead."
Dillon Brooks would have to be better than MJ to be a rationally confident player
Random but did anyone see Dillon Brooks headbutt Mike Conley? It feels weird nothing happened with that? John Starks definitely got ejected from a playoff game with the Pacers for doing something similar to Reggie Miller but Reggie obviously sold it well lmao.
"Still plenty of hope for the jazz. They shot 25% from 3 on mostly good looks. Gobert was awesome when he was on the floor and should play a lot more next game. Dillon Brooks surely won't shoot mid range jumpers like that again this series. Mitchell might come back soon too. The grizz's bench is looking real vulnerable. If the starters for each team go roughly even, I expect the jazz to win most of those games."
I can't be the only that just sees Danny McBride everytime you look at Dillon Brooks.
Ja and Dillon Brooks were phenomenal as well
"He's ruined Dillon Brooks too: https://youtu.be/Cnz6OwVD-LU  dude just chains together three ""you know's"" at one point"
Lmfao this was way out of context.  Also what‚Äôs with commentators loving Dillon Brooks lately lol? First Doris now Reggie?   I‚Äôm all for it though.
You seriously thought he considered Dillon Brooks the only ‚Äúreal disciiple‚Äù of Kobe amongst these 3?   Istg Redditors never fail to disappoint me üíÄüíÄü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"You can run, you can hide, Dillon Brooks arrives all the same"
Future MVP Dillon Brooks is a second rounder
Dillon Brooks is this years version of Jamal Murray last year
Dillon Brooks trying to sprint his way to a top player slot in the NBA. Dude plays great defense on the most talented offensive player in the league twice in a weeks time and scores 31 here?
Put some respect on my boy Dillon Brooks name. Quack attack baby. So glad he is producing at the highest level.
&gt;no one can guard MJ  Dillon Brooks: am I a joke to you?
Dillon brooks hates dead massage therapists and underprivileged kids seeking scholarships confirmed
The world isn‚Äôt ready for rational confidence Dillon brooks.
Dillon or MarShon Brooks?
Might aswell call Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks superstars as well while you're  at it.
"DILLON BROOKS, THE DEMON OF ~~JANE AND FINCH~~ MISSISSAUGA"
Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks says fuck your media darlings lmao
"Next generation showed out this weekend  Luka Doncic: 31 PTS, 10 REBS, 11 ASTS  Devin Booker: 34 PTS, 7 REBS 8 ASTS  DeAndre Ayton: 21 PTS, 16 REBS  Trae Young: 32 PTS, 7 REBS, 10 ASTS  Dillon Brooks: 31 PTS, 7 REBS, 2 BLKS  Ja Morant: 26 PTS, 4 REBS, 4 ASTS"
Dillon Brooks fights over screens like his life depends on it
Is Dillon Brooks a sure shot for FMVP?
Dillon Brooks a better defender than Gobert
Yea Dillon Brooks if he played PG
"Sure, Dillon Brooks is good but I don't know if I'd call him a perennial All-NBA level guy. More like perennial MVP candidate."
Chad Dillon Brooks is his only true nickname
Dillon brooks calling bojan bogdon - ultimate insult in the post game interview
Dillon Brooks was lookin like a light skin Jimmy Butler out there
"If you squint, Dillon Brooks can be Curry for y‚Äôall."
Love watching Dillon brooks now that he isn‚Äôt guarding Curry
Mods are aware that neither Dillon Brooks nor Ja combed for 57 points.   corrected title should be:  [Post Game Thread] The Memphis Grizzlies hang on to defeat the Utah Jazz by a score of 112-109 to open a 1-0 series lead behind Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks combining for 57 PTS
Dillon Brooks after the game ‚Äúthey had a lot of guys who couldn‚Äôt guard me‚Äù
Just got out of a Balinese prison. When did Dillon Brooks become the best 2 way player in the league?
"Good game, fun to watch. I think some people are overreacting a bit. It'll be an uphill battle for the Grizz once Mitchell is back, but the Grizz have some serious guts. Dillon Brooks scares me, and Morant has arguably the best floater in the league.  Shout out Bojan, that guy did NOT want to lose this game."
It‚Äôs sad how some people think that Danny Green is better than Dillon Brooks.
"Alright best playoff debut: Devin Booker, Trae Young or Dillon Brooks? Make your choice"
"This‚Äôll be a fun series. Dillon Brooks is a monster, see y‚Äôall on Wednesday"
What a game by Dillon Brooks. I love to see a Duck have a night like this on such a huge stage.
I thought Dillon Brooks looks more like Deron Williams at home
Dillon Brooks is such an inspiration. He was homeless in high school. He‚Äôs now shredding cats in the playoffs.
Dillon Brooks fucking boomed us. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good.
Reminder that Dillon Brooks was once lectured by Coach K after a game and then Coach K lied about it after
Dillon Brooks really going from an irrational confidence to rational confidence player before our very eyes
Dillon Brooks is advanced
Congrats Grizzlies!  Jazz about to get swept by former Houston Rockets Dillon Brooks and De'Anthony Melton.
Danny Green should be known as Nice Dillon Brooks from now on. Dillon earned it
Memphis Grizzlies is your new favourite team. Dillon Brooks is your cousin. And JV is still Lithuanian Lightning.
LETTTTSSSS GOOOOOOOOO!!!  Chad Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant showed UP tonight yall!
"Dillon Brooks is Tony Allen with offense. Go ducks, Grit n Grind!"
Grizzlies: ‚Äúcall an ambulance!‚Äù  *Dillon Brooks appears*  ‚ÄúBut not for us‚Äù  What a fantastic weekend of basketball. The crowds were electric and a lot of young guys proved they belong to be here.
People talk about Dillon Brooks defense but Kyle Anderson is the best defensive player on. Memphis.
"With Mitchell out, this was a must-win game for the Grizzlies. As much as I love upsets and I was a fan of the Grit n Grind Grizzlies back in the day, I wouldn't rush to make predictions based off this game.  I'm more interested in seeing how the games with Mitchell back will go. Also Utah had a good push towards the end.  In the meantime, TALK YO SHIT DILLON BROOKS."
Dillon Brooks is becoming a star üòç
Dillon Brooks is a freaking bargain at $11.4 mil a year.
"What a day for Kobe disciples, Trae Young, Devin Booker, and Dillon Brooks."
Dillon Brooks legit almost slipped but still managed to walk straight to the rim for an uncontested layup. This is some anti-clutch defence from the Jazz lol
Where were you when Dillon Brooks dropped a 30 burger on the first seed Jazz in game 1?
Dillon Brooks got massive nads
dillon brooks ayyyyyyyy
And Memphis has Dillon Brooks
Dillards? I didnt know dillon brooks had a brother
Every team needs a Dillon brooks lol
Dillon Brooks doesn‚Äôt get facecut like that very often. Nice take there by Bojan.
Nah Dillon Brooks' face is way more punchable :)
Dillon ‚ÄòJesus Aguilar‚Äô Brooks.
Dillon Brooks my bad
Somewhere Robert Sarver is watching this game and telling his secretary that Dillon Brooks is supposed to be on his team.
I forgot that Dillon Brooks is Canadian. Good thing I don‚Äôt gamble
I definitely wouldn't doubt it. I just don't think it's a good look that Dillon Brooks is cooking the team rn. Next game the Jazz will definitely shoot better though
"Ja can take that role going forward in the series though. Tonight was Dillon Brooks, but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs the only big scorer for them."
Dillon Brooks can fuck my wife
I‚Äôm not so sure Dillon Brooks can consistently play this well in the series. He was definitely a huge spark for the grizzlies
Dude I swear Dillon Brooks looks so bad when he plays but somehow he drops 30 what the fuck. Edit: Jaime Jaquez syndrome
"Utah isn't looking too hot. Gets a lot tougher than Ja, JJJ, and Dillon Brooks. Only game 1 but this isn't a good look for the 1st seed"
"Dillon Brooks will probably hound Mitchell the rest of the series. Diving at loose balls, headbutting his ankle, and draining big shots. It‚Äôs what Captain. Grind does!"
"Gobert and Conley got in foul trouble, then Dillon Brooks went ""I'm the captain now"" mode."
Dillon Brooks happened
"JJJ is mostly coming off the bench this year since he came back from injury late in the season. They usually start Ja, Allen/Bane, Dillon Brooks, SLO-MO, and JV"
the image of Dillon Brooks gyrating as his flexes his biceps is now burned into the back of my eyelids
Chad Dillon Brooks is the Grizzlies sub's preferred nickname but we won't hold you to it. Evil Danny Green is great too.
I'm in love with Dillon Brooks
"dillon brooks has 29, wtf"
Tonight we're seeing the version of Dillon Brooks that resides inside the Millennium Puzzle   Unlucky for the Jazz
i fucking love dillon brooks
"Whatchu gonna do when Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, and Grayson Allen come after you, brother!!!"
That is pure Dillon Brooks. For better and definitely for worse. But for the better tonight!
Only if you swear loyalty to lord Dillon Brooks.
"Jazz are without Mitchell, Gobert and Conley have been in foul trouble all game, they‚Äôre shooting 20% from three, Bogey and Clarkson have been absolute shit, Dillon Brooks is having the game of his career, and the jazz are only down 9.  I think things are looking pretty good for us"
"Chad Dillon Brooks as a two way player vs Virgin Paul George as a ""two way player"""
You‚Äôd think Dillon brooks was the reincarnation of Michael Jordan the way Reggie is talking about him
tyus jones need to play like dillon brooks lite rn
Fuck the haters. Dillon Brooks hero arc is way more entertaining than Steph vs Jazz
James Jones was right. Dillon Brooks is definitely better than MarShon Brooks.
dillon brooks looks like a fast and furious character
"Ja is incredible, but he has a solid supporting cast too. Dillon Brooks has been balling tf out."
Right now it's definitely Westbrook  Dillon Brooks plays like he thinks he's Lebron
Dillon Brooks next to Luka
"Dillon Brooks, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Javale Magee  I omitted former Sixers because there‚Äôs a few, but dammit I‚Äôm still gonna say TJ McConnell"
Have you ever seen Dillon Brooks play?
"Dillon Brooks, man is a workhorse even though he plays some dumb hero ball at times"
"That‚Äôs nice,I wish Dillon Brooks‚Äô family would‚Äôve got some,unless they did and they declined"
Read it again he said Dillon Brooks not Ja Morant.
I think he said Dillon Brooks.
What about Dillon Brooks‚Äô family
Already have Dillon Brooks kinda redundant at that point
The Jazz vs Dillon Brooks is becoming a real rivalry that's been fun to witness
"Dillon Brooks has been, and always will be a flopper. [link](https://youtu.be/uyQiz5tLFIY) but it‚Äôs only bad when jazz players do it right?"
Smart is REALLY fucking good. Most of what he does doesn't show up on stats like Dillon brooks. Depends on how consistent brooks remains.
Dillon Brooks
What do you guys expect from Dillon Brooks long term?
Which one? The one about Morant or the stuff said about Dillon Brooks?
"are you confusing Ja with Dillon ""low budget ass Deron Williams"" Brooks?"
"No state income tax. Which is huge when you think you can make an additional 5 mil just by choosing TN over CA. Also, Memphis is a hotbed for fine ass black girls, just ask Dillon Brooks."
Exactly. The Jazz have had the same game plan going up against Dillon Brooks. I think every team's game plan at one point or another is to get the other team's best defensive player into foul trouble.
"Lol true I've been watching that series on the side while doing other things and I stay hearing ""Dillon Brooks has (2,3,4,5) fouls he has to come out of the game."" Like how does he consistently have so many fouls, feels like be averages over 6 fouls a game lol."
dillon brooks would have 2 fouls called against him for this one play
"Now I don't know if I just saw a good sample or not but I agree.  Number 0, Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant, and Greyson Allen was all the proof I needed."
Yeah I was in a similar position and then him and Dillon Brooks made me cry. Even took 3 days off of r/nba
We all know ja is a future superstar but they need more. Dillon brooks is a terrific defender and good scorer but the key is JJJ. If he stays healthy and lives up to his potential they are spooky
"Dillon Brooks is who everyone said Steve Blake was, just an absolute asshole who plays dirty."
And Dillon Brooks
I found out today that Dillon brooks is the guy that did the greatest flop ever. When he was on Oregon and flopped ridiculously against Utah lmao
Dillon Brooks bout to channel Maple Curry
"I have a serious problem with my Dillon Brooks hate. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how annoying and stupid his face looks. And how he talks so much, and backs it up so little. And how he flops, oh boy does he flip and flop around.   I want to like him, but he makes it impossible. He‚Äôs such a damn heel. I normally love those guys, but this dude is trying too hard are something."
I love how clutch Dillon Brooks has been.
I heard from basketball professionals on r/Reddit saying Dillon Brooks only knows how to foul.
I really like Dillon Brooks' maniac energy
"&gt;Dillon brooks finds a new suga daddy, the grizzlies pay to hook em up."
"I like Ja talking to Milton like that when the crowd is basically all over him. Young leadership there.  With that said, fuck Dillon Brooks."
Someone else on the grizzlies: makes a big shot  Dillon Brooks: TIME TO TAKE OVER
Classic Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks is such an awkward offensive player. Everything he does offensively just seems weird
fuck dillon brooks
Danny Green and Dillon Brooks should join a Lionel Richie look-alike contest.
Dillon Brooks and Danny Green are related right? Basically the same dude.
Dillon Brooks is better than I thought
"If you're a neutral fan, how can you not love Dillon Brooks?"
Dillon brooks is a walking 4 fouls
Dillon Brooks always tryna do too much smh
You guys have Dillon Brooks at home
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a small guard get near-fouled out as much as Dillon Brooks lol
"Dillon Brooks, the prince of fouling on threes."
Dillon Brooks is like the worst kid you know in all your classes growing up
It's because Dillon Brooks is a massive douche
What? I haven‚Äôt seen any hate except a little for Dillon Brooks? 90% of this thread is just attacking Gobert personally
Could say the same about Dillon Brooks
I feel like Dillon Brooks would‚Äôve thrived in the 90s lol.
Dillon Brooks lol
Those guys can‚Äôt compete with Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant
Memphis got Dillon Brooks 2nd rd 40 something pick.   Warriors got bums like Mannion smdh useless bum
"Dillon ""Kent Bazemore"" Brooks, fouling machine"
Dillon brooks looks like evil Danny green...
 I didn‚Äôt realize that Dillon brooks is older than Donovan Mitchell.
"As a Jazz fan,  I hate Dillon Brooks. As an NBA fan,  I love Dillon Brooks"
Dillon Brooks is outplaying Donovan Mitchell
It‚Äôs time to talk about the legacy of Dillon Brooks
Lol everybody who isnt a Jazz fan loves Dillon Brooks
Lol Dillon brooks like charmin out there
Dillon Brooks needs to be introduced to manscape/manshave by Barnes and Stephen Jackson
Oh shiiit Dillon brooks slam. Just saw that
We're watching Dillon Brooks become a star before our very eyes. Feels very similar to how Jamal Murray balled out last season in the post season
Yo did anyone know Dillon Brooks can score and have handles like this?
"After barely even casually watching the grizz this season, if you'd ask me whose jersey I'd buy if I was a Memphis fan it'd be Morant no question.  But after watching them in the playoffs, I fucking love Dillon Brooks. I might buy his jersey anyways, idk."
Who gets more money on the open market: THJ or Dillon Brooks? Brooks is 4 years younger so I guess him?
Dillon Brooks wouldnt have that called against him
"Danny ""Dillon Brooks"" Green"
"I want to mention a funny counterpart to this post, but you watch Dillon Brooks play, you look at the numbers, and you‚Äôre thinking this guy is alright, but then you see his advanced stats and they portray him as one of the worst NBA players in the world"
I just hope no one but Dillon Brooks gets into foul trouble tonight.
I dunno why I have the feeling that Dillon Brooks would do this shit when his contract ends with us lmao
&gt; Dillon Brooks vs whichever fanbase he plays  Can confirm
"i love the grizzlies but man, dillon brooks is going to be SOOO hated in a few years"
"Idk if this is specifically done with racist intent, but there is a undertone of racism. 1.) all 5 incidents were black men and 2 had racist language (Ja's family and Dillon Brooks) and 2.) all the fans who did these things were white.  Idk if they were ""being racist"" intentionally, but it sure looks racially motivated."
"I kind of love the fact that we have genuine hatred and rivalries building in this league(luka vs clippers, trae young vs knicks, kyrie vs celtics, Dillon Brooks vs whichever fanbase he plays) so as a neutral observer im all for of these types of acts lol."
Wait Dillon brooks? You mean marshawn brooks right? I get those 2 confused sometimes
"I just went to their sub, and one of the top comments on one of their top posts is calling Dillon Brooks a ‚Äúpunk‚Äù. They used the word ‚Äúpunk‚Äù."
"Ayton is the top of the list FOR SURE  Booker Trae and Ja are 100% showing up in their first playoff games so they‚Äôre looking good  Tatum and Luka are already high but they‚Äôre playing insane ball so they have to be on the list   Cameron Payne  Monte Morris  Dillon Brooks  Thybulle   Everyone on the Blazers, specifically Nurkic though. Yes Jokic is feasting but honestly how can you stop him lol. It‚Äôs just impressive that they‚Äôve managed to hold him at 5 or less assists each game (2x 1 assist, 2x 5 assists)  Everyone on the Hawks  Hate on me all you want but Paul George is DOING IT. Make all the Playoff P jokes, but he‚Äôs balling tf out  I‚Äôve always been SUPER high on Jrue but no one can say shit about him after this series  Andre Drummond made this really weird IQ jump after the first game of the series so why not   Caruso is proving that he‚Äôs what Patrick Beverley pretends to be"
"for fucks sake, stop muddying up a situation you clearly don‚Äôt know the context behind because Orange Man Bad!!!!    This has more to do with Kyrie promising he‚Äôd stay in Boston, being a shitty player to root for who just mailed it in, and left to team up with his friend in Brooklyn, before stepping on the logo of the team.   That doesn‚Äôt condone what the fan did at all, but people like you inserting your narratives and your shitty Trump puns add nothing to the conversation.   Try talking about the literal racial abuse the families of Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks have faced, don‚Äôt project onto this Kyrie situation."
"It's gotta be Ja. Only one 40 point game in his career then drops 47 against the #1 seed, it's nuts. Luka, Trae, Booker, and Tatum have played at this level in the regular season and Ayton has been a blue chip prospect since day 1 who's been gradually putting it together. Dillon Brooks has also taken a huge leap but I don't think many people expect him to be this impactful going forward."
Dillon Brooks has been great
I agree Boston is shitty as all hell but Utah has really taken the cake recently with the shit they said to ja and Dillon brooks‚Äô families
Dillon Brooks too
"&gt;All Morales go out the window   Majority of sports fans to be honest. It's not exclusive to Lakers/LeBron haters.   Sports, what is supposed to be a past time for fun in the 1st place, somehow devolved into something that brings out the worst behavior in people that they wouldn't bring out anywhere else.   If fans can hurl racist shit at Dillon Brooks' family for just being an aggressive player, I don't think we should be surprised people making fun of AD for being fragile."
"&gt;but even if you were able to completely eliminate racism as a thing and have incidents be random or geared toward the best players,  Ja Morant's family and Dillon Brooks family aren't players in the league  &amp;#x200B;  but I also don't guarantee that those fans are necessarily racist. just more so that racial undertones could be what push them to cross the line whether they mean to or not. like they feel its subconsciously more okay to do it to a black player than a white player because that's what history has taught them, or because they're surrounded by thousands of white people in the crowd and that causes them to aim for someone that doesn't look like them.  &amp;#x200B;  incidents will never stop regardless of race, so i obviously don't think every single one is 100% racially motivated."
"Homie, Dillon brooks just had his family called ‚Äúhalf breeds‚Äù at a game and you really think the idea that this would have something to do with race is laughable? Sure, there‚Äôs lots of racist shitheads in Utah, but also in every city in the country"
"I think they said Dillon Brooks is a ""half-breed""."
feels like i'm the only one in the grant williams fan club  it's ok i was the only member of the dillon brooks and facundo campazzo fanclubs too
Dillon Brooks üò§
"I mean, you are incredibly annoying, but I'm not *that* upset, mostly just confused as to why you can't take a joke or like have a convo without dunking on yourself for no reason. Again, I'm not even sure why you're so mad at me, all I said was that I think it's very funny that Dillon Brooks and Mike Conley are interacting with each other they way they are and you just won't stop doing the literal cope face of posting crying laughing emojis and saying ""man you're writing so much you're so mad and corny, I'm so *not* mad that I don't even care to be invested"" while replying to multiple comments in a comment chain like 10 feet deep. Like man, just own it, own the fact that you're mad and want to banter and troll a bit, what is the point of acting like you don't care when you're replying to me like five minutes after I send something. It just doesn't make sense.  And again, it's just kinda... pathetic? Because I genuinely feel like you'd be a better troll if you were either doing a better job of pretending you don't care or actually, idk, saying something creatively insulting. You're just kinda stuck in no man's land of looking really mad but also not actually getting any good jabs in or anything. Just repeating my joke isn't even an insult, it just makes you look silly? Take some time to actually think of something a little funnier instead of just replying immediately with a reply that's just ""I'm not mad, actually you're mad"" because again, it just feels like cope instead of something fun."
Where did I say he wasn‚Äôt good or I wouldn‚Äôt want a player like him on my team? Just like Jazz fans hate Dillon Brooks right now but would love a player like him on their team. You can hate a player and think he‚Äôs good
Dillon brooks is the best player on the team
"[""Punch""](https://twitter.com/JJSportsBeat/status/1398837159524593667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1398837159524593667%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkslsports.com%2F460411%2Fdillon-brooks-mike-conley-exchange-jabs-after-three-during-game-3%2F%3F) lmao. If thats a punch, then Mike should have been ejecting for throwing a mean elbow into Dillon.   It's called slapping hands bro, happens in basketball all the time. I think you guys should just take a deep breath and relax"
"If you think that's a punch, then Mike Conley should have been ejected for his [vicious elbow on Dillon](https://twitter.com/JJSportsBeat/status/1398837159524593667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1398837159524593667%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkslsports.com%2F460411%2Fdillon-brooks-mike-conley-exchange-jabs-after-three-during-game-3%2F%3F)  They were literally just slapping hands bro. Incredibly soft"
"Nah, [the school of Dillon Brooks.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqGtuxfLbY)"
I think ja might be the closest thing to that. Granted some people might not consider him a superstar yet but I feel like everyone I talk to respects him. This coming from a jazz fan who he has been torching for 3 games.  p.s. don‚Äôt ask about our opinion on dillon brooks
"&gt; Kawhi could‚Äôve just pick his spots from anywhere, no matter who was guarding him. I can see Artest and Kobe switching it up a bit and taking turns on Kawhi, and for sure Kawhi would‚Äôve had a tough challenge, but Kawhi also burned Jimmy Butler and Giannis in the previous series. Kawhi was just unstoppable that season.  Hmm   &gt;  That leaves Kobe‚Ä¶again, Kawhi would‚Äôve been a very tough defensive draw. Green was a very viable 3 &amp; D player. Siakim could‚Äôve spelled on Kawhi on some sequences too.  I see that you give leeway for Kawhi guarding Kobe saying it would make it hard for Kobe but for Kobe/Artest guarding Kawhi it's BBQ chicken or something?   Artest was no slouch defender especially against players like Kobe/Kawhi/Melo. Artest would be the best defender in the series hands down and the best player to have guarded Kawhi in that entire playoff run. He undoubtedly would give Kawhi a much harder time than Jimmy Butler. That's on top of Artest trying to make you mentally frustrated while trying to get under your skin all series which is something Butler doesn't do. Imagine how FVV and Dillon Brooks guards Curry, but instead some huge beast that is Artest is on your hip at all times. He didn't give anyone room to breath.  And with Kobe being the secondary defender on Kawhi, he would not be too far off either. He gave Melo a hard time in the 2009 WCF's behind Artest and Melo was just as capable of a scorer as Kawhi, just less efficient but with just as many tools if not more flexibility. I also feel Melo was quicker than Kawhi, while Kawhi is slower but more powerful which would allow Kobe to stay in front of Kawhi much easier than Melo.  There's no one on that Raptors roster that would give Kobe a harder time than what he faced in the western conference. Green would have been Kobe's primary defender but you have to realize that Danny Green wasn't capable of playing defense like prime Shane Battier ([incredibly underrated 1 on 1 defender vs Kobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aDM5d27_w)) and Tony Allen, who both still struggled to guard Kobe. In that video even with that amazing defense Kobe still gets 27ppg that series and drops a 40 piece. Don't forget that Kawhi was hiding defensively all playoffs guarding people like Ben Simmons, Iguadala and playing zone defense against the Bucks, the few times Kawhi is on Kobe, Kawhi isn't going to put much effort into it."
Dillon Brooks got boo'd.. .this is the point of the Home crowd in the WCF
"Dillon Brooks (Grizzlies) comes to mind when it comes to endurance, defense and scoring (although foul prone, which i think can be fixed)"
"Frankly I think Canada will be better than both in 2024. Murray, Wiggins, RJ, Dort, Dillon Brooks."
"Mike is definitely the nicest guy in the NBA, but our best player ever was ZBO and we had Tony Allen. They stayed chirping. Currently we have Grayson Allen and Dillon Brooks. We deffo have the over the top shit talkers."
Dillon Brooks
I was the same way with Dillon Brooks. He went off the last game of the season his rookie year for like 36 against OKC and I was mad impressed. I haven't heard Chris Copeland's name since 2k16.
"I got down voted for saying that if Ja and Dillon brooks can do what they did to the Jazz, just imagine what PG and fucking Kawhi could do. Little did I know it would be Mann but still"
What Dillon Brooks goes into his mind before sleeping tonight : The jazz used up all their resources on me and are now exhausted to beat an injured clippers team
"Meh thats cap. Harris is a very one dimensional role player; all he really does is run around and shoot 3s.  Guys like Mikal Bridges, Dillon brooks, Royce o neale are multi-dimensional role players. They can get boards, play defense, and score. Regardless of whether their shot is falling, they are very important to the squad."
Niang and Dillon Brooks have the most punchable faces in the league.
I don't think I've ever seen Dillon brooks smile on the court
"&gt;They have plenty of cap space, their own picks as well as Utah and GSW. Have shown a great ability to draft players. Also a fairly deep roster. Will need veteran improvements, but lots of young talent. For a small market, that is quite excellent.  Anytime you just have your fingers crossed that the guys you have will get better and that you'll draft well enough to move the needle, you're not in a great position.    &gt;Most didn‚Äôt even have them making the playoffs this year.   And they made it as the 8th seed and lost in a gentleman's sweep, with their only win coming because the opposing team's best playoff player was out.   &gt;Many rebuilding teams would love to have Memphis‚Äôs results in a heartbeat.   Because those teams are bad.  &gt;Ja could leave, but very good chance he doesn‚Äôt. Look at his story. He‚Äôs been an underdog all his life and Memphis plays into that mentality.  That's fun and all until he's in his 7th year of going up against teams with multiple stars with Dillon Brooks and JJJ as his 2nd and 3rd best players, wondering why everything is so hard."
"Reggie Jackson suddenly looks like an all-star point guard. As a jazz fan, I swear every playoffs there is some random role player on the other team that torches us the whole series and plays out of their mind. Last series it was Dillon Brooks, this series it's Reggie Jackson."
The Grizzlies without Dillon Brooks or JV aren't that great of a team honestly
"Sorry dude, Dillon Brooks is Canadian"
"It's dope because even though it's improbable that it happens again anytime soon (or ever, honestly), it just adds to the excitement of the draft as a fan of a team because you know there's always that chance that the random guy you drafted with that second rounder you got in a random trade from 3 years ago could become a superstar. There have always been those few second rounders that develop into stars (Ginobili, Arenas, Gasol, etc.) and more recent examples of guys that were immediate lottery level contributors (Brogdon, Clarkson, Dillon Brooks, etc.) but seeing a franchise build on a guy from second round that's literally one of the most unique talents the league has ever seen is just a whole other level."
"""...and not the top of your head""  you sir clearly haven't seen a certain dillon brooks guarding shooters with his headbutt."
Do you know what a ‚Äúvolume shooter‚Äù is?  Here: it‚Äôs a player that requires a large VOLUME of shots to off-set his low fg% and still be effective/really good.  You think Giannis is a volume shooter getting 30pts/gm shooting 58% on 18 shots per game?  I guess Christian Wood and Dillon Brooks are volume shooters too because they average over 15 fga/gm
"He‚Äôs at the bottom tier of fg% no doubt.  So Dillon Brooks, Christian Wood, Jrue Holiday, Porzingus, are volume shooters?  Edit: is Tobias Harris a volume shooter too?"
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
"No, please, you give me the Dillon Brooks. I'll give you a mystery box."
Or we're trying to do a Dillon Brooks trade without involving the 10th pick.
GRIZZLIES? I want Steven Adams and Dillon Brooks right now
Kuminga for...Dillon Brooks and Steven Adams lool
"Dillon Brooks. Dude is a bulldog defender, and if one fouls out you got 10 more on the bench. Also big enough to play decently* against bigs. Dude can also create his own shot, handle the ball, pass in a system, and drive hard.   They won‚Äôt be favorites, especially bc of all the bricks they‚Äôll be laying out. But his demeanor and workhorse attitude would make one tough locker room culture. And another advantage is that for most championship teams, the finals MVP is a wing. So it helps to have so many interchangeable tough defenders on them to ride them out."
Lol. Reminds me of a couple years back when the Suns/Grizzlies were gonna trade Brooks but neither had agreed if it was gonna be Marshon Brooks or Dillon Brooks
"Memphis is my trading Dillon Brooks, man. That‚Äôs not on the table."
You want us to take Dillon Brooks!? Ok!
"I don't understand what Bane has to do with anything when we were talking about how you said Slomo+10 for 7 is ""not happening"". Plenty of people are discussing how the Grizz would do the trade and I've see Slomo frequently mentioned among players like Bane or Allen. You're the one who said it's ""not happening""  I'm not ""highly overrating"" the Grizz players, I just don't think it would be worth it to move up 3 spots when Slomo was our team leader in VORP, BPM and 2nd in WinShares and consistently our best two way contributor all season.  That's my personal opinion, but if you go to the Grizzlies subreddit there are plenty of people that are okay with it and I understand. I have never said the Grizz would get robbed or anything close to it, in fact I said it was realistic he could be traded.  You are one saying none of these players are realistic, while Dillon Brooks was somehow and acting like Slomo has no value which again shows me you have never really watched him play which isn't really surprising since the Grizz were on like 5 times on national TV"
"Yeah that's just my opinion, but the FO could realistically go for that trade. Unlike the Dillon Brooks trade which had absolutely zero chance of happening in that scenario.  I honestly haven't seen enough of JTA to comment, but Slomo is a different type of player (PF 6'9 230 vs SG 6'6 209) in a different role (19% USG vs 11% USG) so I don't know if the comparison really holds.  Warriors have a small window so a one year rental isn't out of the question and they also could've used his expiring to match salaries and flip for an upgrade, which currently they don't have many salaries to do this except Wiseman or Wiggins"
That‚Äôs what happens when you go bargain hunting for older college players late in the draft. Would it shock you to learn Dillon brooks was 45th in the draft?
"Well we have Dillon Brooks and Jaren Jackson Jr, so... like way better.  In theory anyway depends on how they implement it"
FUCK DILLON BROOKS
7 -&gt; 10 is not worth Dillon Brooks LOL
I will chuck molatov cocktails at the forum if it's a Dillon Brooks Ben Simmons swap
Damn as long as Dillon Brooks isn't getting moved
"I mean if we get Dillon Brooks without giving up any major pieces besides the #7 then I‚Äôm cool with that, idk how salary would have to work though  I really don‚Äôt think we need a Beal/Dame type player, just some solid rotation pieces will get us back to contention. One or two Turner/Covington/Brooks/Smart caliber players would be ideal, letting us keep Wiggins but adding the necessary depth"
Dillon Motherfucking Brooks
"Dillon Brooks Oregon flop might take the cake there for the greatest single flop, doesn‚Äôt have the track record of those other dudes but it‚Äôs a glorious flop  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqGtuxfLbY"
"the grizzlies do have a bit of a log jam at the 2 though, between bane, melton, grayson allen, and dillon brooks (though he can play some 3, he‚Äôs suited to playing at least some minutes at the 2), there really aren‚Äôt quite enough minutes to go around. if the grizz really want kuminga and see him being available at 7, i can see this trade happening for sure"
The Warriors probably  That's a lot to give up for Dillon Brooks + they would have to give up additional stuff to match salaries
"When he gets that tunnel vision, he's the bad Dillon Brooks for sure. When he plays like the 3rd option on the team who concentrates mostly on D, that's when he's at his best.   Hoping that with JJJ back all season we get to see the 3rd option Dillon instead of tunnel vision, contested mid-range, floating sideways jumper Dillon."
The Warriors getting locked up in the Dillon Brooks Penitentiary is what ‚Äúcost‚Äù us Curry in the playoffs.
I‚Äôll take one evil Dillon brooks
"I don't think this means Brooks is available for trade. This is saying that the Grizzlies are looking to trade out of having an excess of perimeter players, a list of whom includes Dillon Brooks. Brooks is a perimeter players of which the Grizzlies have a lot; but that doesn't mean Brooks is a player they want to trade."
"Yes yes yes to the Buddy deal. The only guy I really wouldn't want to move off of is Dillon Brooks, but if we get a good player back and in the draft I'll talk myself into anything"
"Glad this wasnt asked a couple years ago. Between Mike Conley and Dillon Brooks, I think the Grizzlies didnt draft a player that they re-signed. Most werent good enough to get a second contract with *anyone*. But there were a couple (DeMarre Carroll, Greiveis, maybe another 1 or 2) that they traded or released that found homes elsewhere."
Nah y‚Äôall would get RJ Shai Wiggins Dillon Brooks at the very least
Soooo Evil Dillon Brooks?
can't believe you just called dillon brooks that other guard lmaoo
"dillon brooks will turn into the maple mamba next season, jjj will not foul out every game, Ja taking the superstar leap let's gopp"
Is the other guard you're referring to Dillon Brooks? He balled the fuck out last season and in the playoffs
"Ours is more recent though Dillon Brooks is looking nice in Memphis. We got Payton Pritchard, Bol Bol, Chris Boucher and Jordan Bell...so pretty meh generally. Aaron Brooks I guess had a few years he looked nice in Houston but that's getting into old head territory/outside the 10 year window...."
We would gladly take Dillon brooks and 10 for #7
Relax bro lol. Maybe Dillon Brooks or Kyle Anderson would be more like it
"Holy shit!  Memphis made out like bandits on that trade!  Steve Adams is an upgrade from Val (at least in my opinion), and 10 is much higher than 17!  Not that I expect there is much difference in the second round picks.   But they get LA's protected 2022 pick too?  And they get Bledsoe too? I mean... I'm not a huge fan, and I think 20 million is a bit much for him, but it's only two years, and he might actually fit really well as a 6th man, backing up the PG and SG spots.   And Dillon Brooks can play SF and SG, so that gives them a lot of flexibility in the back court and on the wing."
The Pels couldn‚Äôt stop a thing on the perimeter. Happy my boy Steve has Dillon Brooks in his life.
"üòí  Cmon bruh. Depends your idea of ‚Äòdeep‚Äô. Having 6 different 6th man/fringe quality players ‚Äî-but a dearth of  actual starting quality players‚Äî-isn‚Äôt  deep to me.   They‚Äôve been using Dillon Brooks like he‚Äôs prime Kobe. Dude is a gunner. 41% from that field and 34% from 3, but is 2nd on the team in Fga‚Äôs (I‚Äôm guessing, bc any time I watch him he‚Äôs inexplicably featured)  Brooks, Allen, bane, Kyle Anderson, and now bledsoe ‚Äîall of them are best suited coming off the bench."
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
Dillon Brooks
"I'm tryin to imagine what the Pistons and Grizzlies, two teams I like, were offered.  The pistons have no one except the #1 pick that the Lakers would want, and Grizzlies best fits (IE: Dillon Brooks, Bane, ect) are better than Kuzma, and paid less than KCP."
Dillon brooks
Because he's the best player on the team lol who else is gonna take those shots  21 is very normal for your star player Dillon Brooks took 21 shots for the Grizzlies and Demar is def better than him
"The US needs a wing defender who moves the ball. Someone like Dillon Brooks would've been perfect, but he's Canadian.  I can't blame Colangelo for this squad because it's basically the NBA All-Star Team from last year. What I'm saying is that the rest of the world starts building chemistry with their teams pretty early on. US has always gotten away with just throwing today dudes who can get buckets, but the international teams actually have talent and chemistry. At some point, US has gotta start actually just playing guys together. It doesn't matter who you have if players don't know their role.   I also think playing KD at the 4 is a mistake. That doesn't work in international basketball where he's guarding bigs that can't get called for 3 seconds. The early foul trouble is happening cuz they want him to be a stopper when he's a pure scorer"
Dillon Brooks breakout season next year
Depends on 'young' but there's a few others:  * Bobby Portis (26) might not have played inn the Brooklyn series but was huge when Giannis went down and proved his worth in the conference finals and finals.  * Onyeka Okongwu (20) showcased some really strong defense against Giannis  * Basically the entire Atlanta Hawks team  * Terance Mann (24)  * Dillon Brooks (25)   I've probably missed some but those are the ones that stood out to me
"‚Ä¢Zo to the bulls-makes the playoffs  ‚Ä¢Nets trade kyrie for good defenders ‚Ä¢Lakers sign Demar and Lowry, Lebron gets worse but AD steps up and make WCF ‚Ä¢bucks stay the same, resign PJ ‚Ä¢Ja Morant becomes most improved player and all star. Dillon brooks becomes better and Grizzlies become a threat. ‚Ä¢Celtics make another miracle playoff run, only to fall short to the bucks/nets ‚Ä¢warriors trade for a star, klay isn‚Äôt as good as people expect but they still make the wcf"
Just using NBA players they are all pretty stacked:   &amp;#x200B;  **East Europe**:   C: Nikola Jokic / Nikola Vucevic / Jonas Valanciunas  PF: Domas Sabonis / Kristaps Porzi≈Üƒ£is / Lauri Markkanen  SF: Giannis / Bojan Bogdanovic  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovic /   PG: Luka Donƒçiƒá / Goran Dragic   &amp;#x200B;  **West Europe:**  C: Rudy Gobert / Clint Capella / Mac Gasol  PF: Maxi Kleber / Pau Gasol / Jakob Poeltl  SF: Danilo Gallinari / Nic Batum   SG: Evan Fournier / Frank Ntilikina  PG: Dennis Schr√∂der / Ricky Rubio  &amp;#x200B;  **Asia/Oceana :**   C: Steven Adams / Aron Baynes  PF: Rui Hachimura / Andray Blatche  SF:  Joe Ingles   SG: Jordan Clarkson / Matisse Thybulle  PG: Ben Simmons / Patty Mills  &amp;#x200B;  **Non-USA Americas:**   C: Chris Boucher / Dwight Powell / Lucas Nogueira  PF: Kelly Olynyk / Tristan Thompson  SF: Andrew Wiggins / Bruno Caboclo / Nicolas Brussino  SG: RJ Barrett / Dillon Brooks   PG: Jamal Murray / Facundo Campazzo / Raul Neto
A 2-way wing that's better than Dillon Brooks.  They just need to consolidate all of their talent for a player like that whenever they become available.
Trust Dillon Brooks as a legit scorer and get a better SF
And y‚Äôall still don‚Äôt have Dillon Brooks. Damn impressive team you guys got.
Hope we have Dillon Brooks back for our Wolves games!
I like Ja and Dillon Brooks Brandon and even slo mo
He'll always be Chad Dillon Brooks for me.
"Dillon ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
"Other players taken at or around 46: Dillon Brooks, and DeAnthony Melton. But there are probably many more misses than gets after the lottery."
I have been impressed with Dillon Brooks defense while his shooting is inefficient I value him pretty high.  I have been pretty unimpressed with Brandon Ingram pretty much every time I watch him play. Lots of mediocre iso possessions and bad team play.  Now I haven't watched a ton of either player so I can't give any strong opinions on them but that's how I see those two.
You think Dillon Brooks is better than JV and Brandon Ingram?
Dillon Brooks is a god. My hot take/overreaction is that Jaren will be our #4 this year and still be worth the contract
"Top 15 probably averaging 23/24 , if he took a little more 3pt shoots with 40% top 5 is possible, but almost impossible for him right now, Dillon Brooks is coming too"
"As a Grizz fan, no, I dont think this is sustainable.  The reason? Dillon Brooks.   He has not played this season because of injury. Once he returns, he and his shots will likely rejoin the starting lineup. And he will average double digits. Most of those points probably come at Melton's expense (and Melton will regain most of his losses being the primary scorer off the bench). But some will come from Ja, as Ja will want to feed the ball to his big bro."
As someone closer to a Muggsy Bogues than a Manute Bol or Dillon Brooks I feel personally attacked.
The demon Dillon Brooks ain't playing. We better than you too!
Ladies don't like a Muggsy Bogues or a Manute Bol. They like a nice Dillon Brooks sized guy
I watch the two games last year and he was only irritated by Dillon Brooks constantly fouling him. But other than that nothing he sees from the grizzlies is any different than what he sees from other teams. I mean the last 3 games against the grizzlies he's averaging like 37ppg.
We're also missing our best defender in Dillon Brooks. Might have something to do with it
"Thanks, man! Same goes for Dillon Brooks, guy is a menace"
Fuck Dillon Brooks literally gives me nightmares.
"Oh yeah, it was for sure just a dumb joke lol this Grizzlies team plays completely differently than the old one.  They‚Äôre scary now, but they‚Äôre gonna be even scarier when Dillon brooks gets back. They played good D tonight but with him it should take it to another level."
"They got JJJ, Dillon Brooks, Adams, Bane and Clarke. They have some nice talent"
We're missing Dillon Brooks. You know the heart of our team and the dude who scored 20ppg in the playoffs last year?
We get Dillon Brooks back and we can really turn up then
wow no Dillon Brooks makes a big difference
not having dillon brooks is probably playing a big role tbh
Poor Dillon Brooks
Do you mean fouling a three point shooter? My guess would be Dillon brooks
"Most of these are totals, but I think OP screwed up and put fouls per game for that category.  Fouls per game leader is KAT  Total fouls leader is Dillon Brooks."
Dillon Brooks gets into Lebron's head and gets them both ejected in the second. Grizzlies put in a hard fight for the rest of the game with a final score of 109-81 Lakers take the 8 seed
U actually think Dillon brooks is the dpoy?
MVP - Westbrook  DPOY - Dillon Brooks  MIP - Rozier  ROY - Campazzo   COY - Thibs  6MAN - Gallinari
Dude that Dillon brooks defense was criminal!! Hand checking him all game until he got ejectedüò§
"You can't stop Curry but you can keep his numbers down.  Dillon brooks did a good job yesterday keeping Curry's numbers normal, the other grizzlies defenders let him go supersonic."
I feel like Dillon Brooks should be getting an award. Do you have a list of most fouls against a three point shooter?
Fucking Dillon brooks. I‚Äôm scared of playing the grizz again
no one's gonna talk about Dillon Brooks?
"**Most games as top scorer - best on team**  1. Stephen Curry - 52 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 50 3. Luka Doncic - 49  **Most games as top scorer - second best on team**  1. Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Brandon Ingram - 24  **Most games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. James Harden - 16 2. Malik Beasley - 15 3. Caris LeVert, Jordan Clarkson, Dillon Brooks - 13  **Fewest games as top scorer - best on team**  1. John Wall - 20 2. Pascal Siakam - 21 3. Malcolm Brogdon, Ja Morant - 22  **Fewest games as top scorer - second best on team**  1. Terrence Ross - 7 2. Andre Drummond, Khris Middleton - 8  **Fewest games as top scorer - third best on team**  1. Rui Hachimura - 3 2. Carmelo Anthony, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Orlando Magic - 4"
&gt;Personal Fouls: Dillon Brooks  Too soon.
"Totally unrelated to what Wiggins did, but Dillon Brooks looks like Danny Green."
Not trying to continue to pile on him but it does seem whenever it's a big game or moment Dillon Brooks is the one stepping up and willing the team instead of Ja
Hot take but I think Dillon Brooks is the best player on that team
wait is that Dillon Brooks
"I don't understand why some guys can get away with playing ""tough"" defense like it's 90s while others get called for ticky tack fouls on the softest contact. Dillon Brooks is definitely one of those dudes who gets away with playing super physical. If most other dudes try playing defense like he does they get called for two quick fouls in the 1st quarter and into foul trouble for the rest of the game."
Yeah they went on like 25-10 run after brooks went out. Dillon was doing a damn good job on Steph but he ended up with 34 in the second half
"lol not at all, Draymond is not a pesky type defender that fouls a lot, he plays nothing like Dillon Brooks who stays glued to his man and grabs his jersey and shit the whole game. Dray plays more like a free safety, where his strength is in his help defense, which leads to much less opportunity for fouls"
"When people say the Grizzlies go as Dillon Brooks goes, they aren't kidding. I do not relish the thought of facing that man again, but it's highly likely we're getting a round 2 next week.  Also JJJ is NICE. I'm glad I got to see him a few games this season."
"funny af, warrior fans want DB called on every single contact with Steph. How about they call every illegal screne Looney set tonight to?  Like what? You rlly think NBA Refs tryna give Dillon Brooks an advantage?"
I actually felt bad for the Grizz in this game. They came back strong to take the lead but then Steph checked back in and Dillon Brooks fouled out and it was game over
"Yeah, I do not want to see Dillon Brooks again this season.  Plus they'll be better prepared to game plan against Steph, since this was the first time they've played against him with the youngin's."
You can thank Dillon Brooks for that. Dilllon Brook giveth (sparking the 4th quarter comeback) and Dillon Brook taketh (by fouling out on in an ill-advised manner and knocking the momentum out that he helped to create).
Dillon Brooks fouls a shit ton. Let‚Äôs be real here
"Dillon Brooks, who was fouling Stephen Curry for the majority the game, fouls out. :shocked:"
"Had less when you exclude garbage time FTs, gotta hand it to league leader in fouls Dillon Brooks for hacking Steph all game and not fouling out until the 4th"
Like Dillon Brooks tonight
Dillon Brooks dumb last foul really just cost the grizz their entire season huh
He is supposed to have a good efficient game against elite competition and instead it appears Dillon Brooks and Valuncinas are the ones carrying.
You got to have a personality disorder to actually play well against such a killer like Steph and by god does Dillon Brooks absolutely have a personality disorder
lol dillon brooks should've  fouled out within the first half he was just holding on to Curry's  jersey all fucking  game
"Live by the Dillon Brooks, die by the Dillion Brooks"
Dillon Brooks playing that Dellavadova defense where you just pull Steph's jersey all the time and foul him offball because he knows the refs won't call anything
You got to have a personality disorder to actually play well against such a killer like Steph and by god does Dillon Brooks absolutely have a personality disorder
This was under heavy defense from Dillon Brooks most of the game too. Any other guy wouldn't have made most of those 3's
That Dillon Brooks thumbnail is amazing lol
Dillon Brooks really had me scared for my life out here. GG Grizzlies.
This game is a perfect illustration to the box score watchers why Dillon Brooks is so important to us. Live by the Chad die by the Chad.
"Amazing how quickly things went to shit for the Grizzlies after Dillon Brooks fouled out, it was like flipping a shit switch"
Dillon Brooks being the highest +/- on our team whilst being 6/14 tells you all you need to know about his game
Dillon Brooks better be a Grizz for life
"I hate Dillon Brooks, but that game was theirs if he didn't foul out"
"Dillon brooks going 6-14 but being +7, highest on the team, tells you all you need to know about this game"
"memphis shouldn't have fallen apart just because dillon brooks fouled out. team is still really young and has a bright future, but they have lots of things to figure out"
"Dillon Brooks looks miserable, poor dude"
Imagine being Dillon Brooks lol. Hustle your team back then they forget to box out lmao
the real highlight here is Dillon brooks face
dillon brooks looks like Danny green with less curly hair
Man someone said Dillon brooks looks like a fat danny green
When Dillon brooks fouled out this Memphis team died

"this is chad brooks right now, dillon is no more"
Dillon Brooks looks feral
Dillon Brooks reminds me of a young Danny Green...even shoots like him
"Dillon Brooks has been pretty good on Steph, but he‚Äôs eating on switches."
Dude is lighting them up. Knew when Doris was talking about how Dillon Brooks was locking him up he was about to go off lol.
It feels like Dillon Brooks would be the all-time leading scorer if he shot at least 50% for his career; he jacks up so many shots
Dillon Brooks is playing great defence.
"I think JJJ is their fourth best player behind JV, Ja, and SlowMo. Could make an argument for Dillon Brooks but he‚Äôs too inconsistent offensively for me"
LeBron hates Dillon Brooks cause he's from Canada and has LeBronto'd us three times this season already
"Dillon Brooks- ""Say less"""
"Please don‚Äôt kill the Warriors bigs, Jonas. He‚Äôll be Prime Shaq out there  I‚Äôm scared Dillon Brooks will go off like Prime Kobe."
In before Dillon Brooks holds Steph to 7
"Aaron Brooks, Dillon Brooks, Armoni Brooks, Scott Brooks  I think Portland just gets torched by people with the last name Brooks"
Dillon Brooks and Devin Booker go hard at each other in their games.
Dillon Brooks always plays like LeBron murdered his dog or something so maybe that
Dillon Brooks is the single most important man in Sunday's game. Either he clamps Steph and drops 30 or he fouls out in the 3rd and goes 1/20
Dillon Brooks is having his Lu Dort moment
Not a basketball fan. But my friend asked to go to the bars to watch the Knicks game. I was rooting for the Knicks with him. I don‚Äôt have a team. But after the oilers game and the Knicks game I‚Äôve been loving playoff sports today. And this game is really entertaining. I know nothing about this sport but i like Dillon Brooks and his team
Dillon Brooks was a second round pick btw cause SHORT ARMS AND OLD. Draft heads can get fucked there's some stuff beyond physical traits you need to measure
Dillon brooks has always randomly had games like this where he‚Äôs just unstoppable on offense. If he plays like this all series...oh man
"Dillon fucking Brooks, Sauga represent"
Dillon Brooks is becoming the player he always believed he was right in front of your eyes.

"How was Dillon brooks not in DPOY convo? He certainly passes the eye test, do the stats back it up?"
Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson don‚Äôt get talked about enough. Glad to see them get their due credit on this stage.
perhaps Danny Green is just good Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks is locked the fuck in. Man I love this Memphis team so much.... I love the Jazz too but I love seeing the underdog do well. I would love if Memphis could steal a couple games
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs opinion on Dillon brooks? I‚Äôve literally only seen the last three grizzly games and I already love him lol
"Dillon Brooks been playing like this, y‚Äôall just noticing now that he‚Äôs doing it on the big stage"

dillon brooks is becoming one of my favorite players in the league lol
Dillon brooks is the best perimeter defender in the NBA.

Yet you root for Dillon Brooks the worst flopper in college basketball history???  Goddamn your fandom is sad.
And yet Rudy still flops way less than Dillon Brooks
Unlike Dillon Brooks' shooting in the 4th lol
"I can‚Äôt wait for a 4 years from now when the Grizzlies are a top 3 seed in the west. You better believe I will hate Dillon Brooks, but god damn will it be electric."
"you biased af dawg.   BI, Lonzo, SA &gt; JV, Dillon Brooks, and JJJ  only place Ja has a better teammate is at Center. Ja so far has proven to be more conducive to winning than Zion. I‚Äôd take Ja personally over Zion because he‚Äôs a ball handler."
"Oh man, if only Jaren Jackson Jr could rediscover his shooting form, and if Dillon Brooks would not commit insane fouls, it could've been a different game.  I hope Ja eventually is more consistent spotting up from 3 as well, the guy will be absolutely unstoppable once players don't sag off him and dare him to shoot.  Still, Memphis grinded it out to compete with the number 1 seed, and that is impressive considering how much shooting the Jazz have in comparison.  I hope Memphis can come back and grind out a win in game 4, but I think this will be Jazz in five guys :("
Imagine writing this novel because you're so in denial about how annoyed you are by Dillon Brooks [lmfao](https://i.imgur.com/V88cNT2.jpg)
"[Bud you need to watch it again](https://twitter.com/JJSportsBeat/status/1398837159524593667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1398837159524593667%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkslsports.com%2F460411%2Fdillon-brooks-mike-conley-exchange-jabs-after-three-during-game-3%2F%3F)  Mike is absolutely talking shit, not doing the Buddhist monk act like you claim. The fact that fucking Mike Conley is talking shit to anyone should be evidence enough that Dillon is a pest. Idk why you're trying to act like something it's not, it's just two men talking shit"
"Seriously, I thought he was gonna sink us tonight but suddenly Dillon Brooks decided to shoot instead"
"From Dillon ""Jamal Murray"" Brooks, to Dillon Brooks"
"my honest opinion on Dillon brooks; GOOD player, I think he could be a great player but not a superstar. He is obviously a emotional player on the court but at the same time I think by having so much emotion it hurts him. It seems he commits a lot of frustration fouls. If he could control his emotions it would help more than it would hurt him. He is the type of player that is annoying to play against from a fan perspective. If he could use his aggressiveness in a positive way I think he could be a #2 leader behind JA"
They were called a moving screen earlier in the game too on gobert when I persobally thought gobert had positon. Dillon brooks ran into gobert and brooks and fell straight back.  I think thats why the big guys stopped setting hard screens. I saw that gobert  wasnt setting screens in the 4th at all. He would set a split second screen and just roll to the basket.
"Was Dillon Brooks this good in the regular season, I feel like if he was him and Ja morant should have done better."
Bro those clips of Dillon Brooks punching him and headbutting him and he's just chilling blow my mind. I'd be fighting a fool so fast. But Mike has a calm head and keeps it cool
Approachable Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks in the first 3 quarterss: Michael Jordan  Dillon Brooks in the 4th quarter: Dillon Brooks
You mean nice Dillon Brooks?
"Nah, he punched Conley in the back twice. Fuck right off Dillon Brooks"
Why haven‚Äôt I seen anyone mentioning Dillon Brooks punching Conley?
*cries in Dillon Brooks*
"Uh oh. I‚Äôve heard those words before, except Dillon Brooks was replaced with Jamal Murray"
"To Dillon Brooks, the cause of, and solution to, all of the Grizz problems."
"Yeah Ja scoring 48 and Dillon Brooks being a decent player aren't anomalies either.  Anyway, gg dude, I'll be rooting for the Grizz next year (when they don't play us)"
"your team is underrated. you guys played us v well during the regular season as well. getting JJJ back was huge, along with dillon brooks and - to my surprise - Grayson‚Äôs development this year."
"I feel like the griz really only made a run at them because they were crushing the offensive boards in the second half.   They Grizzlies are really throwing everything they can at the Jazz, but nothing they do seems sustainable. Ja is a beast but he won't put up 30+ every game, Dillon Brooks the same thing, they also can't play at their intensity crashing boards constantly.   They put up a bigger fight the first 3 games than I think anyone would have thought, but I feel like they may be running out of gas.   not writing the grizzly out yet, but I have a feeling the next 2 games will be blownouts."
Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant have been really good on offence. Brooks in particular has 82 points on 34/64 shooting in 33 minutes per game.
"Live by Dillon Brooks, die by Evil Danny Green"
"Refs weren‚Äôt perfect, but Dillon brooks choked a perfectly winnable game away.   Grizz better take the other game, otherwise they‚Äôre gonna look back on this game with lot of regret."
"I wanna root for the Grizzlies, but I just can‚Äôt for some reason. It‚Äôs because of Dillon Brooks lol"
Mitchell and Gobert played well but Dillon Brooks was definitely the best player for the Jazz
"He‚Äôs had success going at Gobert. Gets fouled sometimes, makes the bucket sometimes, and sure sometimes he gets the fuck blocked out of him.  Insanity is the way any Grizz big is defending against the Gobert Conley pick and roll, Jesus Christ it‚Äôs been a guaranteed bucket for the last two games.  Insanity is Dillon Brooks fighting over screens against Mitchell every time even though it‚Äôs a for sure 3 point foul with the way the refs have consistently been calling things.  Ja should keep going at Gobert."
I'm seeing a Dillon Brooks problem in Memphis
"Shot them back into it, shot them back out of it, fouled out. The Dillon Brooks special."
"Live by the Dillon Brooks, die by the Dillon Brooks"
"Dillon Brooks has a lot of heart, but not much brain"
Mitchell and Gobert played well but Dillon Brooks was definitely the best player for the Jazz
We had a lead with 4 minutes to go until Brooks went full Dillon.
"Dillon Brooks out there living up to the ""Evil Dany Green"" nickname."
And yet we wouldn‚Äôt have been in that position without him. The Dillon Brooks way.
That unfortunately goes against everything Dillon Brooks stands for. He legitimately thinks he cannot miss
"Dillon brooks 1/7 from 3 pt, bricking his last 3 shots in 4th in crunchtime. Let Allen shoot his threes next game and you might have a chance against the jazz. Coach has to say something in these situations"
The media creams itself to those ‚Äúfouled-out Dillon Brooks meanmugs from the bench‚Äù shots
Dillon Brooks with the MarShon Brooks confidence on offense lol
Dillon Brooks is a gunslinger
Dillon Brooks looks like a primary antagonist
i swear Dillon Brooks has fouled out of every Memphis game I've ever watched
Dillon brooks needs a personal barber. Dude looks like he‚Äôs living in the Amazon
"Dillon Brooks just decided to end the game. Blows wide open 3s a couple minutes ago, chucks an awful shot last possession, fouls a 3 point shooter to foul out and wrap it all up."
Dillon Brooks single handedly throwing this game for Memphis
Dillon Brooks sit yo ass down
Haha fuck Dillon Brooks
Does anybody foul out more than Dillon Brooks?
Dillon Brooks? More like Dillon Bricks
Dillon Brooks should shoot only 3s and no middies
Dillon Brooks has the nastiest green light in the league
Oh no we have Dillon Brooks today not Chad.
I‚Äôm a bigger college fan than NBA fan so it‚Äôs cool to see Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen balling out again. Two guys I wouldn‚Äôt expect to be good pros.
Dillon Brooks really is the evil Danny Green.
"Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks are both right up there when it comes to ""how the hell are this guy so good"""
Dillon brooks is sick
"Man I love Dillon Brooks   Fearless, fights over screens   Just does everything you want"
Its just funny to me. As a neutral fan Dillon Brooks would never cross my mind but these comments seem to have a personal vendetta against him
lol at all the jazz fans hating on dillon brooks
"Dillon Brooks at. The tattoo parlor:  ""Lemme get that stretch mark looking special."""
Dillon brooks jeez
I think last week Zach Lowe said on his podcast that Valanƒçi≈´nas and Dillon Brooks were like a perfect tag team from the 80s and...let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm distracted.
"Dillon ""Which"" Brooks is having himself a series"
Dillon Brooks is slowly becoming one of my favorite players
Dillon 'Not Marshon' Brooks with the nice spin move
"given the context, that dillon brooks and him have been jawing at eachother, and the headbutt from game 1, it‚Äôs hard to give this the benefit of the doubt"
We can‚Äôt stand our Brooks here in Washington. The verdict is not out yet on Dillon who almost became a Wizard years ago.
*Other than Dillon Brooks
"Dillon Brooks seems like the kind of guy that will stick his foot out for shooters to land on when he gets mad.  If you're not above punching Mike Conley, what won't you do?"
dillon brooks is a disgusting player....game 1 he headbuts conley and now he sucker punches conley. guy is a piece of shit.
‚ÄúSome of their personalities aren‚Äôt the best‚Äù  - Fan with Dillon Brooks on their team lol
https://twitter.com/colecisne/status/1398830613004619782?s=20  Here's a nice little video of Dillon Brooks punching Mike Conley and trying to disguise it as playing basketball
"Relax, man. I still love Dillon Brooks."
"Basketball isn't a combat sport, Dillon Brooks. Dude get away with a lot of cheap shots"
Dillon Brooks should foul out every game.
I'll say it again. Dillon Brooks looks like a Garbage Pail Kid got left in a hot car.
Dillon Brooks got a punchable face
Wtf is up with Dillon Brooks kidney punching Mike Conley
Dillon Brooks would be the most hated player in the league on another team.
damn dillon brooks must be talking a ton of shit if even Conley is pissed off
Anyone else catch Dillon Brooks shoves? He does it quite a bit on defense
Dillon Brooks has no fear
I fucking love Dillon Brooks
"Dillon ""Evil Danny Green"" Brooks"
Fuck dillon Brooks
Danny Green? You mean Washed Dillon Brooks üò§üò§ /s
"tough year for Canada this playoffs, at least Dillon brooks is showing up"
Bubble Murray X Dillon Brooks is gonna be dope
"In Eugene I had to tell Dillon Brooks he and his crew of like 15 people weren't allowed at our party. He kept lying, making up names of people who told him he could come hang. The entitlement was super annoying but not surprising. He at least wasn't the biggest asshole of his group about it. A couple of his friends were really confrontational and borderline aggressive. I had to almost shove them out the door because most of them were in the house by the time everyone realized a bunch of randoms were funneling in. The only reason I picked up on it was when I recognized Brooks and I was like, we definitely didn't invite him and I've seen where this leads lol. Anyway, he was an ass and I can't stand people lying to my face.  On the other hand, when I was still an undergrad our neighbor was Carlos Emory. Cool guy. Best party we ever had was when we told him ""hey, we're having a party tonight. Invite whoever you want and make it big."" Pulls his phone out and within 10 seconds he's like ""I gotchu."" Best party ever."
Dillon brooks better than Ja üòÇ I've heard it all. And dude put up 47 points against a 1 seed and you're saying it's bad because he lost by 10. Incredible
And Dillon Brooks. Look what happens when Ja is the best player on their team getting blown out 10+
"And Wiggins, and Boucher, and Dillon Brooks, and every Canadian player who‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt RJ Barrett. But Shaq and Nikeil can stay"
It's literally ALL mental for paul george. If he just had Dillon brooks confidence he's be insane
Proud Dillon ‚ÄúMugatu‚Äù Brooks hater going back to his Oregon Ducks days.
"She does this with Kawhi and LeBron too, and I've noticed it with Dillon Brooks as well. Doris does a good job, especially compared to the rest of ESPN's crew but she does talk about some players really weirdly."
"Yey people are trying to blame Kyrie for saying how he hopes there is no racist incidents.   The players know what‚Äôs said to them. And then people in the Jaylen thread trying to use his response against Kyrie. Different people have different mindsets.   Ja, and Dillon Brooks in one game both got racially abused."
"It wasn‚Äôt even that the Jazz took their foot off the breaks. We scored 29 in the quarter. We just could not buy a stop. Ja, Dillon Brooks, and valenciunis could not miss at all."
Okay the Dillon Brooks stuff was fun game 1 now he's out here just trying to hurt people
"Dillon ""Literally jumping into every three point shooter I can find"" Brooks really got robbed of his playing time, for sure."
"ah i see, you're just a simple historian for weird and made up reasons why utah fans don't like dillon brooks"
"Charles' point sounded like someone who didn't actually watch the game. He's a Dillon Brooks fan for sure, we get it. But Kenny is right that Mitchell drew those fouls. Brooks getting in foul trouble doesn't mean the Jazz got lucky, they literally caused that to happen because they were better this game.   Kenny nailed it too when he said Mitchell only played like 25 minutes. Why is that glossed over by Charles?"
Yeah he flops or sells contact every time he has the ball. He also just bowls into people and rarely gets called for what should be an offensive foul. Also lots of illegal pushing and cheap shit on rebounds. I know it makes people feel better to pretend that the other player is the bad guy but it‚Äôs just kinda childish. And let‚Äôs not even get started on Dillon ‚ÄúI foul every possession and hope they won‚Äôt call it‚Äù Brooks. Stop making excuses.
did Dillon Brooks do some shit i missed? Jazz crowd really seems to hate him
Dillon Brooks looks like a Cabbage Patch Doll that got left in a hot car.
"wow, dillon ""the dirty player"" brooks sure does love to complain, try not fouling loser!!!"
Lmfaoo Dillon brooks taunting
Imagine booing fucking Dillon Brooks for saucing on your team lmfao
Lol why are the Utah fans still booing Dillon Brooks I‚Äôm dead üò≠üò≠
Dillon Brooks really needs to attack. He was 8/9 with like 5 minutes left in the 3rd. What are you doing? Ja can't carry you over this full Jazz team.
dillon brooks looks like he pulls the covers over real tight in bed when he farts
Utah is normally my western team but no way in hell I'm rooting against my guy plus Dillon Brooks a good Canadian lad and Ja? no way I'm not cheering for the Griz
Dillon Brooks became Kawhi Leonard with knees these two games and the rest of the team has been decent to good all season?
"He's been pretty awesome. 20ish points on good efficiency. Had a few ""fuck you"" 3s against Dillon Brooks that were some good television. Not an all-timer Mitchell game, but definitely he's looked like he's back to his old self."
The nba logo is based on Dillon Brooks
Why are they booing Dillon brooks lol is it because he‚Äôs too good?
Dillon Brooks had 18 points in 13 minutes. Fuggin redonculous.
We gonna need to respect Dillon Brooks name man. Absolute fucking killer
"Bro Ja Morant is not better than those two player RIGHT NOW. He will be but right now I‚Äôm taking those two over him. Also, Dillon Brooks is cooking as well so idk what you‚Äôre talking about."
Dillon Brooks a greasy ass 7/11 looking mother fucker
Grizz fans have been wonderful but Dillon brooks and Anderson aren‚Äôt chirping so much
Dillon Brooks is just the evil Kyle Anderson
"Dillon Brooks has, I‚Äôd say, the worst hair in the league outside Trae Young. this weird Shakespearean mullet thing. dude can ball when he wants to tho"
Dillon brooks has one of the most epic flops in college basketball history  [flop](https://youtu.be/JaqGtuxfLbY)
Dillon Brooks is just the modern day Bruce Bowen
Jazz fans about to cut the wifi in Dillon Brooks hotel room tonight
He def plays chippy and ‚Äúdirty‚Äù but you can respect that kinda play.  Stockton dirty as hell and I love him for It. Dillon brooks is a chippy player he is liked by the grizz  Dirty/chippy play and respected aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive
fuck dillon brooks
Dillon Brooks is a bitch lol
Dillon Brooks is legit super talented - pulling off that dribble step so effortlessly smooth like he does is elite
Fuck you dillon brooks
dillon brooks is a bad bad man
Dillon brooks is a baller
Is Dillon Brooks the most hated man in Utah?
Dillon brooks the heart and soul of the grizzlies
Stop booing Dillon Brooks lol he seems like he might make us regret that
Suns legend Dillon Brooks is too good.
Each day I like Dillon Brooks more and more.  What a player that guy is.
Everyone mad at Mitchell for talking was silent bout Dillon Brooks last game üòÇ
Mitchell dropped 70 points on 24/40 shooting in two games against the Grizzlies this season. Dillon Brooks won't phase him.
If Jazz fans are letting Dillon Brooks in their head this much after 1 game I can‚Äôt wait until they have to play a real superstar
Dillon Brooks is to the grizzlies as turtle is  to entourage
New York: boos Trae Young  Salt Lake: boos Dillon Brooks ‚ò†Ô∏è
Jazz already turning it over again. I hope Dillon Brooks punk their ass again.
i like dillon brooks now. pissing off fans every where you go is an art
Who do Jazz fans hate more.   The Rockets or Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks spit hot fyah
DILLON BROOKS IN HIS BAG
why they booing dillon brooks so much??
Oh lawd Dillon Brooks getting the Trae Young treatment from the fans lol
"admit it, it's cause of dillon brooks"
I kinda love how the Jazz are worried about the matchup with Dillon Brooks when Ja feasted all game.
dillon brooks
"Considering he's been a shooting guard his whole career and plays with Ja Morant, Tyus Jones and De'Anthony Melton, no, we do not consider Dillon Brooks  a point guard."
Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks should match up with him pretty well?
Do we consider Dillon brooks a PG cuz he has owned Luka as well a few times
"Ja would run the offense but Klay would score the most, take the most shots, etc. Dillon Brooks leads them in FGA right now. Klay is a lot better at scoring than him."
The only other guys I can think of that actually give Luka Trouble are Dillon Brooks and Mikal Bridges.
"It‚Äôs time to acknowledge that they do not have 2 of the best wing defenders in the NBA. Kawhi is still great when engaged but he just doesn‚Äôt have the stamina do it for the whole game. He‚Äôs probably still one of the best despite that, but PG hasn‚Äôt been at that level in LA.  Guys like Simmons, Bridges, Dillon Brooks, Crowder, Giannis, Thybulle, Draymond, Smart, Butler are all better at defending the wings through the course of a whole game."
Cant wait for the Dillon Brooks Doncic matchup
"Honestly, I'd like someone like Dillon Brooks on the Dubs. He'd be like Harrison was for them."
"Double team him and he is passing over the defense.           He can also force switches at will, so you better not have a weak defensive link.           The only thing that somewhat works is a great 1-1 defender with size like Ben Simmons and Dillon Brooks.         I think he is going to figure that matchup soon as well."
I mean I wouldnt be surprised if Dillon Brooks gets racial slurs in Utah. I was looking at the jazz sub and they were saying things like he looks like he stinks. The fuck is that.
I really want Dillon Brooks on my team üò≠
I have a strong feeling that Ja Morant and Dillon Brooks were there too
"In this scenario we would be moving JJJ too. I love Melton but even with a shot he's still worth moving for a star wing who is gonna be a plus defender anyways. Dillon Brooks and JV can't take turns being the second best player and expect to win anything. Melton's contract is so good because it is so tradable. I'd rather move Grayson Allen(if he extends) tho don't get me wrong but order of untouchability goes imo is Brooks, Bane, Melton, Konchar then Allen."
"I think I'd go Shareef Abdu-Rahim or Mike Bibby over Dillon Brooks, unless you are keeping this Memphis exclusive.   Shareef was averaged 23/8/4 one year and Bibby was very solid."
&gt;Scoring will be a bit hard  For the opponent too lol. You could move Dillon Brooks to the wing and sub Pau out for Anderson/Gay/Prince/Randolph to add Tony Allen to the starters for just a ridiculously annoying defensive lineup lol.
"Dillon ""Curry's nightmare"" Brooks gets a super max for sure."
Dillon Brooks and having short ass T-Rex arms
"That‚Äôs funny. You listed the Grizzlies twice.  Since 2014 they have drafted from picks 14 and on;  Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane which is a better haul than Rozier, Williams, and Pritchard.   Not to mention they did it with way less picks."
Dillon Brooks yelling after every basket made
All time is Marc Gasol but currently it‚Äôs Dillon Brooks
"I know he isn't a ""superstar"" but Dillon Brooks had a bigger impact on the entire game and without him we 100% lose. Ja took over in the 4th but without Dillon we were never in the game to start with."
But Dillon Brooks had 32?
"Dillon Brooks, probably. Mid 2nd rounder around 45 or 47th pick. Chris Wallace's best decision. We didn't draft Deanthony Melton, but he a good mid 2nd rounder, too."
"Idk if you paid attention to basketball much this year but Wiggins just had an excellent defensive season. I love Dillon Brooks, but there‚Äôs no comparison"
Dillon Brooks is Canadian too right?
Dillon Brooks and Lu Dort to name a few
"Please, tell me more Dillon Brooks facts"
"Is Barrett going to play? Not going to lie, Dort, SGA, Barrett, and Wiggins is a pretty solid set of players to set up a team around, and think about if Dillon Brooks plays too. That‚Äôs the makings of a pretty deep scoring team, and some really solid defense too."
My man needs a talking from Dillon Brooks.
Ah the Dillon Brooks special lol I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll adjust
What about the absolute chad Dillon brooks? Is he gonna play too
So does this mean that the Grizzlies are going to win several championships because they have grayson allen and dillon brooks?
Olynyk in international play is a a mosnter. Dillon Brooks might play too
"Arguably Dillon Brooks is better because Brooks plays defense, too."
"Well I apparently don‚Äôt follow Team Canada very well since I didn‚Äôt even know Dillon Brooks played on the team. You learn something every day.   I only see the maple Jordan memes and comments about Shai, Jamal, and RJ. No Canadian Brooks memes unfortunately. But now that I know I will contribute."
Kinda blew my mind that I just recently learned Dillon Brooks was Canadian. He‚Äôs been solid but nobody ever mentions him for the team Canada squads.
Dillon Brooks lives for this kind of disrespect. (you prob just didn't know but I love #takes)
"Ja Morant Says 'I‚Äôm ~~Not~~ Afraid of ~~Nobody'; Also Calls~~ Dillon Brooks, an 'Assassin''."
"Damn, he's almost as good a defender as Dillon Brooks"
"Dillon Brooks is drunk, never met a shot he didn't like."
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
"Lol nice, I expect it on every Dillon brooks thread now"
Ja Morant Says 'I‚Äôm ~~Not~~ Afraid ~~of Nobody~~ '; Also Calls Dillon Brooks an 'Ass~~assin~~ '
Dillon Brooks already has 2 fouls before tip off confirmed.
it's no longer dillon brooks time :(  \- dillon brooks
"dillon brooks is going to get 3 fouls by early 2nd, and then you know steph will start cooking. he's going to get another couple quick fouls in the 3rd, and the warriors should control the lead from there. - scott foster"
Dillon Brooks is fouling out in the second quarter.
"Even if we get a friendly whistle, they can only do so much. If Jonas Valanciunas and Kyle Anderson and Dillon Brooks are hitting everything, we're screwed unless Steph goes off. Also I have a bad feeling Ja hits his threes today. Bad shooters always seem to go off against us"
I got 5 with Dillon Brooks and Bill Russell. Pretty crazy imo.
"Doris' new bae, Dillon Brooks.  Oh Canada motherfuckers."
I‚Äôm worried about Dillon Brooks. Sunday‚Äôs game seemed like it could have gone either way until he fouled out
LOL Dillon brooks?? He got us good too
"I could easily see us getting a beneficial whistle. The league probably wants Steph in the playoffs over Memphis. Much like the Warriors do every game, Dillon Brooks also fouls a lot. I think I saw a stat saying he has gotten more fouls than any other player the last two years."
&gt; Dillon Brooks might foul out in the first quarter  Let's be a bit more realistic. He's more likely to foul out in the middle of the third quarter.
"Dillon Brooks led the NBA in fouls the last two years man, he's pretty much the first guard ever to lead the NBA in that stat so if he picks up 2 quick fouls it's probably nobody's fault but his own.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pf_yearly.html"
I was hoping I wouldn't have to see Dillon Brooks again this season. Or JV.
Were that many people prepared to witness the unfiltered Chaddery that can only be described as Dillon Brooks? Sudden exposure to such extreme levels of Chadliness can have extreme effects on a casual's virgin mind.
Dillon Brooks: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised motherfucker‚Äù
dillon brooks brings the ratings
"Not NBA , but NBA player Dillon Brooks in college vs Utah  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqGtuxfLbY"
"So does Golden State.   They are already better than Memphis, but when I think about the whistle they are about to get tomorrow, with Steph playoff ratings money on the line? And with Golden State getting jobbed by the refs against the Lakers?  Phew.  Dillon Brooks might foul out in the first quarter"
Not on my team is Steph Curry and recently Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks
"Dillon Brooks and Kyle Anderson are randomly two of my favorite players in the league. Both of them hustle a ton and Anderson especially I feel like just does all the little things. Feel like they carry on the Grit and Grind mentality as much as anybody on the team. Anybody have a clip of the Melton/Anderson blocks on the fast break and then Anderson yells at his teammates (not in a bad way) to get back on defense? Also Grizzlies fans, how has JJJ been since his return? He was mostly quiet for the part of the game I got to see but does it look like he's taking the right steps to be back at 100% next season?        I feel like the Grizzlies have a legit shot against the Warriors tomorrow but I'm also assuming Silver will call in the refs to get Brooks in foul trouble early. Probably some calls that normally don't get called to free up Steph. In any case, it's going to be a tough/frustrating game so Brooks is going to have to be careful not to get too upset and pick up another tech."

"Dillon, terrified, running away from his own team's offensive play into the back court to escape Draymond. He looks over his shoulder to see if he's still following but can't find him. He begins panicking, looking left and right and all around. Dillon screams as Draymond appears out of the fucking sky and falls on top of him and then to the floor, clutching his ankle and yelling at a ref.  Brooks is fouled out and Golden State wins again"
Unironically fuck I hated the thought of having to deal with JV and Dillon Brooks again. Ja not gonna be cold this time too..
Lol it‚Äôs a vet move. Game shouldnt have been influenced by it this late in a game i agree. But y‚Äôall got away with it when Draymond flopped on Dillon brooks to get him fouled out or in the first half when ad got into post position and Draymond just fell over
Dillon Brooks is always angry
Dillon Brooks
He ain't dropping 50 on dillon brooks cmon now. 30 max and even that's being generous
Dillon Brooks
"Except Caruso is actually a pseudo-elite defender. Dillon Brooks pretends to be because he's ""physical."""
Dillon Brooks is also really good at making the other teams star player so annoyed that they go nuclear on him.
dillon brooks is a fucking bum who if they called fouls like they do against every other non scrub player would foul out every game
Dillon Brooks has been impressing me lately. Interesting to see how he tries to contain Mitch and then can JV still do work vs Utah. Only reason fans generally want Golden State is because Steph and they're more proven.
We coming and we bringing Chad Dillon Brooks again.  Maybe we can hit a few shots this time.  Maybe give y‚Äôall and the refs/skeletor a real scare.
"He's good at the rim if given the lane. But in a decisive play when you might be forced to make a pass or a difficult shot, nope.  Don't like Mamphis either. Valanciunas and JJJ will be a problem at the paint and Dillon Brooks will try to get at Curry's soul.  Sucks because I think there would be a chance against the Suns"
Who's gonna guard Dillon Brooks?
Could be Ja morant and dillon brooks?
Dillon Brooks smiling
Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen are about to drop 70 combined on you
Everyone in the Grizzlies organization looking at Dillon Brooks rn
"We had it tied with 5 minutes left when we played the last regular game of the season. Dillon Brooks did a fucking amazing job on Curry but fouled out. GS definitely should win, but all it takes is some good shots from us and you never know"
CHAD DILLON BROOKS GONNA MAKE LOT OF THESE COMMENTS LOOK SILLY LATER
Yeah but dillon brooks is a fucking dawg i am scared of him
We get to get another game of Dillon Brooks that's more than enough for us
they're favored but Dillon Brooks will make them work for it
Idk pretty scared of Dillon Brooks on Curry. He did a good job Sunday and did a good job on Derozan tonight
Dillon Brooks is inevitable
Chad Dillon brooks will remember this
the jazz should fear Dillon brooks
Dillon Brooks smiling right now at that foul on Draymond
"Dillon ""Dastardly Danny"" Brooks out here triggering the shit out of me. he's much better off the dribble than Danny ever was, though. hell also shoot you out of more games than Danny would, but I've never seen him give anything less than 110% even if it can lead to some hard fouls and shit.   the kind of guy that even if he pisses you off sometimes, you love having him on the team because you know no one is gonna get away with lacking hustle while that guys on court. the same reason we love Keldon so much, that desire to win."
Dillon Brooks looked like Kawhi guarding DeMar. it kills me. lol
A lot of times we live and die by Baze. He's kinda like Dillon Brooks for Memphis except less skilled.
You realize Dillon Brooks is undefeated in play-ins?
Whoever loses this autoloses to dillon brooks tho
Curry going to get hot in the 2nd and Warriors win by 20 leading to Valanciunas bodying up AD and Bron getting outplayed by Dillon Brooks.  You heard it here first
Dillon Brooks is your favorite players favorite player
Dillon brooks might be the best player on that Mavs team in a year or 2
"Playoff JV showed up like he was back on the Raptors. Also, Dillon Brooks is built for the postseason. He's a winning player"
The Dillon Brooks effect
"Dillon Brooks reminds me of Miles Bridges. Think it's crazy both guys were PF's in college and now are just 2 of the craziest 2 way, athletic SG/SFs in the league.   Btw, (Celtics fan here) can we get Jonas Valanciunas and SloMo? I've wanted him for a while, but after tonight's game, I'd settle for JJJ or Brandon Clarke."
Dillon Brooks and Miles Bridges are like the same exact guy.   Both played PF in college and now are a couple of the best young 2 way wings in the league
Lebron has Dillon Brooks posters in his bedroom
Dillon Brooks is becoming a /r/nba favorite and I‚Äôm here for it
"No.  Dillon Brooks makes layups and can dribble three times in a row.  Other than that, the comparison works."

Yup if DG is Mario then dillon brooks is Wario
"We got hosed by the refs, JV, Dillon Brooks and playoff DeMar (who somehow ended with 20 points) and we almost did it. Of course it's not good enough but at least we don't have to extend our pain to watching the Jazz stomp on us"
Chad Dillon Brooks put the CLAMPS on him.
Dillon MF Brooks
"Few pretty straightforward takeaway from the game:  Dillon Brooks was the best player on the court. JV was a beast and played insanely well too, but Brooks was simply immense. His play just screamed intensity, urgency, and excellence and both ends of the floor tonight.  Dejounte is too good at defense. Seriously. Big part of why Brooks went crazy tonight is because Dejounte kinda took Ja out of the game.   About midway through the 4th, they decided to go a possesion where they switched it up, put Dejounte on the hot Brooks and let Keldon Johnson defend Ja, and Ja just went past him like he wasn't even there. Whereas Dejounte made it look like he was in prison.  Despite Dejounte's efforts to take Ja out of the game though, it was cancelled out by Derozan's poor shooting. He didn't have terrible looks or play badly, he just shot awfully. And the other options for the Spurs are simply not as good as Memphis's other options, at least certainly in this game."
doris: ye lemme get sum of dillon brooks
Dillon Brooks defense was suffocating I loved it.
Fuck Dillon Brooks and fuck the refs for letting him foul all night.
"We got hosed by the refs, JV, Dillon Brooks and playoff DeMar (who somehow ended with 20 points) and we almost did it. Of course it's not good enough but at least we don't have to extend our pain to watching the Jazz stomp on us"

Doris could you remove your lips from Dillon Brooks ass.
Not as pumped as Doris when she finds Dillon Brooks hotel room later
How about Dillon Brooks and them Grizzlies???
BWAH GOD THAT'S DILLON BROOKS' THEME MUSIC
Dillon brooks is a mans man
Does Doris have a little crush on Dillon Brooks?
Doris' love for Dillon Brooks is just weird at this point.
dillon brooks should get a tech for that hairline
Cheering for the Grizz for their nice unis and DILLON BROOKS!
Can‚Äôt tell if Doris is a fan of Dillon Brooks or not
"dillon brooks fouling on every shot but they're not gonna call it because ""playoffs"""
How are Grizz fans gonna claim to be underdogs when Dillon Brooks has been absolutely deepthroated all night long
Dillon Brooks being a bitch baby lol
"Dillon brooks is somewhat underrated man. Not heavily, but he doesn‚Äôt get enough credit."
No way this isn't Dillon Brooks hair I see through your lies

Dillon Brooks really about to get a max

it's dillon brooks so I dunno
What happened there with Mike Conley and Dillon Brooks??
Dillon Brooks is fired up. Looks like he's talking a lot of shit
You just let them get theirs and hope that they‚Äôre off at that point honestly. Only two players I‚Äôve ever seen actually bother Luka into having a bad game are Dillon brooks and ben Simmons.
"Ja is great. He still didnt carry his team. Jonas is good, Dillon Brooks is good, his coach is good, etc.  Ja is only in the playoffs because the play in. Idk how you can dispute that. Without it they are the first team out."
"&gt; Evil Danny Green  Dillon Brooks, plays for Memphis"
Yeah. He also does pretty well against Dillon Brooks compared to most guys
Dillon Brooks looking fly as hell here
"The reason why Draymond was so successful is that he knows how to keep in his role. He's not this bad in 15/16 and 16/17 as you saod but he's never making it into Harden level of offensive god and that's fine. He's successful because he takes his role well - which is to defend, playmaking as well as serve as the vocal leader.  I agree he needs to get his shooting back but phrasing it as 'expanding your game' assumes as if he was never good at it ever which, as you said, not true since he's proven it in 15/16 and 16/17. It's likely that those two seasons were statistical anomaly and will never likely to be replicated. It's not like he's not contributing offensively. Playmaking is still a part of offense.  When you have other scorers on your team - Oubre and Wiggins - I think Draymond should take less shots. Forcing him to be an offensive options makes the two of them obsolete, even more on Oubre.  Seriously, if he ever decides to be out of control and try to do more offensively, he's going to be seen as another Marcus Smart or Dillon Brooks (when he forces his shots)."
Dillon Brooks is easily the lamest guy in the nba lmao
dillon brooks looks like a supervillain
Dillon Brooks was a mad man last night
"Dillon Brooks: 2 wins at play-in tournament  Steph Curry: 0 wins at play-in tournament  i mean, it's pretty clear who is the best here"
"**OVERTIME**  Unlikely hero with the deep shots in OT as Grayson Allen hits us with bay to back threes, including one after another out of whack pass by Stephen Curry out of the double team. [The vision of Tillman for the assist in the first one is marvellous, in opposition to the abhorrent transition demesne by the Dubs on the latter one.](https://i.imgur.com/5opZ7T6.mp4)  [Jordan Poole with the clutch shot to put Golden State up 2](https://i.imgur.com/apWIKIO.mp4) and Tillman makes up the miss in regulation on the opposite corner, [with a beautiful feed by the best jumping passer in the NBA](https://i.imgur.com/6eZmCeZ.mp4).   The rough patch continues for Wiggins who missed both jumpers, including a 3-point attempt that doesn‚Äôt even touch the rim. After Poole dribbles off his leg, it‚Äôs up to Ja to clinch the playoff spot. He attacks JTA 1v1, spins inside and [hits the floater - the shot that has served him so well this year - scoring his 35th point in 29 shots, including 5-10 from deep](https://i.imgur.com/2itlkSS.mp4).  Poole [shows up again for a miracle shot and a glimpse of hope](https://i.imgur.com/A6KB3B2.mp4) but there was not enough time to do another comeback.  [Memphis‚Äô defense was the main story](https://i.imgur.com/DgdcXmp.mp4) and I honestly never expected that would have been the case - it‚Äôs what brought them to the position of advantage they enjoyed for most of the game. They had more steals than turnovers! Incredible display on the road with high pressure for such a young team.  Put some respect on Dillon Brooks‚Äô name because these 2 games he‚Äôs been just outstanding defensively, and the support he got inside to avoid cuts to the rim was great as well. Tillman did a fantastic job coming off the bench, especially on defense in the balancing act of covering Draymond Green and making sure to contain Steph enough to give time for Dillon to recover. And Ja Morant made the most of every chance in a way that he didn‚Äôt on the previous game in a great display of control and poise (He even had some great defensive plays, both top-locking Steph himself or bothering people on recoveries). Not to mention the shots by Allen or the masterclass that Kyle Anderson put out there.  For the Warriors, it‚Äôs hard to make any takeaway expect it is impossible to win when turnover over the ball in such a way - and that has to fall on Curry and Green, combining for 13. It seems to an extent that they had all these high intensity games caught up to them but the expectations at this level are cold and ruthless. Like in the Lakers game, they had a TOV% and an Opposition FT Rate both crossing 20%. So once again, they win the half-court battle but are completely destroyed in transition (160 ORTG in transition plays for the Grizzlies this game on CleaningTheGlass. That‚Äôs a lot btw.)  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **NOTES:**  Great adjustment making sure to match Brook‚Äôs minutes as much as they could with Steph after the way he got hot against Melton the previous game.  Not just the terrible lost possessions, but Dray was so much less impactful on defense than he‚Äôs been the last few weeks. Another indication the fatigue caught up to him.  Since the broadcast didn‚Äôt call it out, [just want to give props to Looney for the great seal here](https://i.imgur.com/XmkiyNw.mp4).  The Jordan Poole rise is something I will never understand but something I will always be thankful for. He simply came back from the mid-season G-League bubble as a great player. His decision making is surprisingly good and that was visible in multiple points down the stretch. Honestly, if they wanted to have him out there (and I agree it was the right call), he should have gotten more on-ball plays, getting Curry less times facing a double team and taking the ball out of a cold Andrew Wiggins.  Mulder‚Äôs shot has just not been reliable enough in these games. 1-8 from deep in the Lakers and 2 Grizzlies games.  Kyle Anderson is such a solid 2-way player and such an unconventional entertaining watch. He got a huge amount of responsibilities on help defense this game and [absolutely delivered](https://i.imgur.com/prSALaH.mp4). A very well earned +11 on the night."
"**1ST HALF**  The crispness that characterised the first half with the Lakers was not to be displayed in Chase Centre - The game started with slips in Warriors‚Äô execution such as [Bazemore pointing Looney to close out to Morant in transition and both players go towards Jaren Jackson, Wiggins going over a screen on Ja Morant or Draymond with another sloppy pass costing a possession.](https://i.imgur.com/af3qx53.mp4).  Dillon Brooks continued right back up with the great ball denying on Stephen Curry, [top-locking before he can use a screen but never overreacting to the point Curry can slip the other way](https://i.imgur.com/R5OWIXj.mp4). Great job for the Grizz if the only people touching the ball an entire possession are Looney and Green.  Or, [to bring it all together in a single clip‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/nY8n66I.mp4) The play for Wiggins to post up on the left side has been a part of the Warriors offense this entire season but it has worked by exploiting swathes to smaller guards. Doing it on 6‚Äô9 Kyle Anderson seems like a bad plan. The moment Morant stayed home, Andrew should have looked to reset the play.   Morant does hit a 2nd 3 as Curry goes under the screen and the Grizzlies have an early 10 points after going 6-6 to start the proceedings.  [Painful to watch](https://i.imgur.com/tntlkmV.mp4); 4 turnovers in less than 4 minutes.  When they sat JV and went to Jaren as the stretch 5 I actually think it helped the Warriors defense. Looney was so preoccupied with denying JV‚Äôs threat near the rim that he never really committed to contain the ball handler in pick-and-roll. Now, Looney (or any Warriors playing the frontcourt) [is more comfortable switching on defense as it no longer represents a deadly mismatch for some poor wing-sized player.](https://i.imgur.com/CTPMi0H.mp4) Kerr would bring JTA in the next possession and downsize as well.  Ja Morant came out looking to prove something after Friday‚Äôs game. Started with making his 3 point shots and was [throwing JTA into a blender 1v1.](https://i.imgur.com/FsoBF5O.mp4) Halfway through the 1st and he was outscoring the Warriors 10-9. Chase Centre sounded like it was the peak of the pandemic.  [The Warriors were looking like they have never played together](https://i.imgur.com/rltn89b.mp4) - Bazemore should know that‚Äôs always a switch.  An important change takes place as Poole checks in - The chance to have someone else running pick and roll and add some extra spacing for Curry to run around in the week side [starts to pay some due](https://i.imgur.com/kRuL3D0.mp4). This was immediately followed by [the ‚ÄúCurry experience‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/5F1j03R.mp4) and suddenly the game was within 2 after Steph‚Äôs 10-point spree. With an apparent shift in momentum, the quarter ends a tight 30-29 for Memphis.  As Looney starts the 2nd quarter, it is now clear they are matching his minutes with JV. And the way he opens up the path to the rim for the Memphis offense returns as well - especially deadly if you don‚Äôt have Draymond‚Äôs help defense to mitigate [how much Looney gets pulled by JV‚Äôs gravity](https://i.imgur.com/Eh5Xqbz.mp4). Same goes for how he can act as a hub at the top of the floor - [and you just can‚Äôt switch off like that when guarding Bane](https://i.imgur.com/CZxaZGg.mp4).  A nice Warriors play as they bring the big out of the paint, open up the weak-side and [have the point guard set a back screen for a wing to finish an alley-oop](https://i.imgur.com/vjCb2vA.mp4). A similar play (with a different build up) can be seen [here giving a dunk to Kelly Oubre](https://i.imgur.com/onco4eJ.mp4).  Wiggins goes at Grayson Allen and, blowing by him, draws the 3rd fouls on Jonas at the rim. The big goes to the bench again with his team ahead by 6. They were looking to have Andrew post up Allen but [good job fronting the bigger player](https://i.imgur.com/9L9SFyg.mp4).  With the starters back in, [the turnovers out of Draymond and Steph passes continues](https://i.imgur.com/dYq2aeB.mp4). With the constant sloppiness, [the controlled play of Morant](https://i.imgur.com/mPLoLyv.mp4) and the better outside shooting (MEM shooting 9-17 and Curry missed a couple of wide open ones), went to rest leading by 13.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **2ND HALF**  Early in the 3rd we saw the home team busting out a zone defense and [the different look worked to create some confusion and staleness](https://i.imgur.com/yYf4q4p.mp4).   Foul trouble continues to pile up as Jonas and Jackson Jr. are both on the bench with 4 fouls halfway through the 3rd. Related tot hat and since I haven‚Äôt mentioned him yet. Tillman was wonderful off the bench. He snipped a pass from Green earlier on, blocked one of Dray‚Äôs drives to the rim and he was efective spreading the floor on offense as well.  Ja Morant‚Äôs shot was a gigantic swing factor. It seemed like 2 or 3 of the defensive breakdowns by the Warriors this game resulted in an ‚Äúso wide open its practice‚Äù 3 point attempt by Ja and [he never failed to make them pay](https://i.imgur.com/oXyPEvu.mp4).  There were a couple of occasions near the end of the quarter where the Warriors broke down the defense - [one where the separation caused by the screen on Brooks lead to a general overreaction that opened the corner 3 and another where in semi-transition where Draymond‚Äôs drive collapsed the defense](https://i.imgur.com/mLl1bAn.mp4) - but in both cases Bazemore couldn‚Äôt make them pay.  Still, Memphis went a bit cold as they couldn‚Äôt capitalise on several Morant drive-and-kicks. By missing the last 9 attempts of the quarter, the Warriors managed to go into the 4th only down 5 points.  In one of the most shocking moves of the season, Kerr actually starts the 4th with Steph Curry on the court - it really is do or die. The fact that this breaks the usual rotation also meant it was the only stretch where Curry got to play without being harassed by Brooks. What is ridiculous is that, in the 2 minutes he got in this situation, they were running plays for Andrew Wiggins. Embarrassing management of possessions.  Already back in the meat grinder, [Curry gets everyone in the Bay a ticket to the circus](https://i.imgur.com/DqmDo04.mp4). Then, the inverted pick-and-roll causes a miscommunication between Melton and Brooks, [for another insane shot](https://i.imgur.com/s4QsMDe.mp4). On the other side, Valanciunas (being used every trip to start things off with a DHO) was creating havoc, [both on the offensive glass but also making use of his pass to punish double teams](https://i.imgur.com/LI3u6OY.mp4).  But the turnovers kept on coming: [Curry starts the Memphis fast break himself and Wiggins fumbles a pass while cutting for the second season-defining game in a row](https://i.imgur.com/tWqFfSv.mp4). He also missed a layup within the last 5 minutes.  A Warriors 9-0 run over 2 minutes, where the defensive intensity was noticeably better and the Warriors were capitalising out of those stops, [culminates on Valanciunas fouling out and Curry tying the game from the free throw line at 97.](https://i.imgur.com/oWrTC8q.mp4)  In the possession of regulation for the visitors, Ja wanted to attack Curry but the pre-switch with Draymond broke down that initial action. They then spread out and give the ball to Kyle, the person Curry is guarding to attack 1v1. Draymond comes in to help and force the kick out for [a quick Tillman corner 3 as the shot clock expires that misses wildly.](https://i.imgur.com/qpC5QIH.mp4)  Draymond on the roll gets his floater contested in perfect fashion by Xavier Tillman and the game goes to overtime."
"Shoutout to Dillon ""Neo"" Brooks"
sadly curry got exposed and is officially below Dillon Brooks all-time
This is a great point and I'ma let you finish but Dillon Brooks had one of the most hard-working performances of all times
"the wife has asked about 90s ball, what is hand-checking etc.  had her focus on Dillon Brooks last night, slowed down a bunch of plays where he hand-fucked the shit out of Curry chasing him around off-ball  him and Zion/Joel in the paint are decent throwbacks"
"if this was big dillon brooks he would have been suspended for the whole week, but leplayin or stephanie? go ahead child be yourself"
Future 4-peat FMVP Dillon Brooks is coming
dillon brooks with the chad energy
Just when I thought Dillon Brooks couldn't bug me anymore he sits there looking like he thinks he's the terminator.
"Shout out to Dillon ""Chad"" Brooks"
"Not better than any of those guys, Ja, CP3 or Beal. Last I checked, Wiggins was rookie of the year and a walking bucket, draymond is a hall of famer and Jordan Poole balled out. But sure he doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.    Who does Ja have that‚Äôs better than Wiggins and Draymond? Dillon Brooks? Cmon son..."
Dillon Brooks is better than Jaylen Brown. I'm insanely jealous of the Grizzlies. They have a brighter future than the Celtics.
"Dillon Brooks is the real deal and he's great.  Unless he's playing Portland, then fuck Dillon Brooks."
Today is one of those days that I like Dillon Brooks.
"ah yes because the warriors just lost to a superteam led by *checks notes* ja morant, dillon brooks, and jonas valanciunas"
Dillon Brooks was doing his damn thing.
"Ja wants his respect , Taylor Jenkins wants his respect   and most of all...  Dillon Brooks wants his damn respect."
All I know is Dillon Brooks &amp; Grayson Allen are the villains.
"The final regular season game against the Grizzlies was the same. 12 TOs by the Grizzlies, 19 by the Warriors. If Dillon Brooks hadn't fouled out we probably lose that game too."
"After Valanciunas fouled out, Tillman made some huge plays that won them the game. Great sub by Jenkins instead of going to Jackson Jr. Kinda sad Dillon Brooks had a subpar game, since I was rooting for him after that Spurs game."
"This game is a great example of box score not telling the whole story, Curry scored 39 but watching the game it felt like Dillon brooks shut him down"
Westbrook is Dillon Brooks if he decided to put all his energy in defense instead of rebounds and assists.
"This excuse is so lame. Its not like Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks, Xavier Tillman, and Desmond Bane are much more respected than guys like Poole, Bazemore, and Wiggins"
Dillon Brooks was incredible defensively but holy shit how are you going to let him shoot long 2s all game with a stacked roster of competent shooters.
"people really typing up these emotional ass butthurt ass comments about steph lmao. that man balls tf out every single game, grizzlies had clamps on them but thats kinda wtf ur supposed to do to win games. steph is not trash, Ja is not the next MJ or whatever other hot take yall keep coming up with. Curry is a part of a team with several other members i think yall forgetting he still scored 39 fucking points with Dillon Brooks all over him"
"I hate my life and JORDAN POOLE, KENT BAZEMORE , GRAYSON ALLEN , DILLON BROOKS , KYLE ANDERSON. Jordan poole for that nasty turover"
"Non-biased perspective:  Warriors overperformed with their roster because of Steph, who played at an MVP level this season.  Fun as hell to see, but just not sustainable for the playoffs.    Grizzlies stepped up and flat out won.  Ja looked amazing.  Dillon Brooks has legitimate clamps.  I don't think they'll go far in the playoffs but they showed they no doubt deserve a spot and I think they will be a legitimate contender next year if they can keep their roster and improve.  Real winner: play-in tournament. It's here to stay."
My mans Dillon brooks put the clamps on curry
"That hurt, but not as bad as the Lakers beating us. Good game Grizz, hope you do well in the playoffs. Gonna have nightmares about Dillon Brooks and Ja."
"Dillon ""The Curry Stopper"" Brooks"
"First of all, Steph is incredible.   Second, put some damn respect on Ja Morant and the Grizzlies! I don't care if you didn't wanna see us play the Jazz, we just balled out. Ja outplayed everyone on that floor. Dillon Brooks is electric on defense and a supremely underrated two way player. Kyle Anderson came up huge. We beat the refs and the Warriors tonight. Give us our damn respect! Memphis vs Errbody!"
i don‚Äôt really care who wins but i really dislike dillon brooks
yo low key tho but Dillon Brooks was ass today offensively
I'm an obsessive Dillon Brooks hater and even I think this game has been BS for Memphis.
dillon brooks stop thinking you're prime kobe lol
They're gonna need to scrape Dillon Brooks off of Steph's ass on the way to his car after this.
&gt;4.Scott Brookes is almost an all defense guy..Most impressive thing is avoiding fouls.  what a ride this point was. It's Dillon Brooks and he led the league in fouls lol
Why is Dillon Brooks taking these miserable shots?
I have a whole new respect for Dillon Brooks.  This guy is ridiculous.
"Steph with 32 even with Dillon Brooks playing fantastic D on him, rest of the team can't do shit while Memphis is slowly rebuilding their lead."
Lmaooooooo yo Steph turning the ball over every possession Dillon brooks got him in JAIL
God damn Dillon Brooks is nutty.
"Ah, a disciple of the Dillon Brooks school of offense"
Dillon Brooks got some bad hair lol
You mean 2x reigning league leader in fouls Dillon Brooks? Yes.
Dillon Brooks has come so far. Grizzlies fans gotta be pleased with how he‚Äôs coming along.
Curry is on his way to Dillon brooks prison
If Memphis ends up winning this Dillon Brooks is gonna be one of the most hated players in the league lmao
Dillon Brooks got too much pent up rage
dillon brooks is doing 2 fucking much bruh ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è calm the hell down u look like a school shooter
Dillon Brooks might punch out a ref tonight lol
It was Tony Allen. Now it‚Äôs Dillon Brooks
He's been pumping himself up in the mirror all half to foul out Dillon Brooks in four minutes.
Dillon Brooks has just enough to bother him
Dillon Brooks walks like he's got diarrhea when he's guarding Steph
Dillon Brooks' defense on Steph really puts the GOAT in Trim That Motherfuckin GOATee
Don't disrespect Dillon Brooks like that
Dillon Brooks might be the franchise @ Griz fans
Steph has too good of a player to allow himself to be locked up by fucking Dillon Brooks
"In his first 3 seasons (excluding 18-19 because he was out for the grand majority of it) Dillon Brooks has ...  - Played more minutes per game in each season than Danny has ever in his career - Has a usage % higher than Danny has ever had in his career - Is averaging 6 ppg more than Danny has ever had his career          - Averaged 5 more ppg in his sophomore season than Danny's best   Dillon is much more than a spot up shooter, he can handle the ball, he can play off and break through pick and rolls, he's an insanely good finisher, and he combines that with a very decent shooting game. Obviously Green has had a much more successful career, one that has been super exceptional for a role player. But no one would say Danny Green is better than players like Bojan Bogdanovic, Jaylen Brown or Tobias Harris, even though their careers nowhere compare to Danny's.  Dillon already seems to be a player who doesn't have to hide as the 4th or 5th best player on a VERY good team to be useful. Outside of that role, Danny is okay, and that's a very narrow role. He's been very lucky to bounce from Spurs, to Raptors to 76ers.   Tony Parker isn't better than Tracy McGrady, I think this is a similar sort of situation."
"I hate him cuz we‚Äôre playing against him, but Dillon Brooks is quite good at the game"
I want to make a barbarian in DnD based on Dillon Brooks.
"I ran a fantasy basketball league that ranks players inverse to their efficiency, and offensive/defensive contributions. This season, the top 3 players in the league are: Dillon Brooks, RJ Barret, and Issac Okoro."
"Truthfully, I like both of these teams, and I wish they both could make the playoffs.   This iteration of the Grizzlies will be good in the coming years. Ja is legit. Dillon Brooks is becoming a very reliable 2-way player. J3 can get hot quick. Definitely carrying the pride of the Grindfathers.   But the Warriors are always going to be one of the most dangerous teams in the league as long as Steph is there. And doubly so once Klay is back. I can't imagine Steph missing the playoffs.   Maybe we should just have the play-in for West teams every year."
Is this the Brooks (Dillon) that would‚Äôve gone to the Wizards but the trade was botched by Ernie?
I think Dillon is better overall but I think Danny Green fits into his role better if that makes any sense. Dillon Brooks on the Sixers in Green's role though would be absolutely disgusting  plus imagine playing against Dwight Howard and DB in the same game lol
"Let Dillon Brooks make a finals, much less lead the league in 3's made in the finals"
I agree with you. Dillon Brooks is a team player but also not a team player at the same time if that makes any sense.
Dillon Brooks was doing work against Curry last game before he fouled out. I think that matchup is going to be the most important thing in this game.
It's an interesting comparison because Dillon Brooks is kinda just Danny Green who got the green light to jack up mid range shots all game.
Dillon Brooks has a chance to become a top tier villain if he prevents Curry from making the playoffs.
"Ahh yes nba legend Dillon Brooks  In all honestly Demar is the last of a dying breed of player. His game is simply not built for the modern NBA, and it shows in the playoffs when the games actually matter. Nothing against him, but the league has evolved past scoring guards that can‚Äôt shoot."
"If Dillon Brooks shuts down Steph enough for the Grizz to win tonight, I can see him having enough confidence to present problems to the fluidity of the Jazz offense if he is hounding Donovan Mitchell. Being able to push around the undersized Jazz guards is key."
"So why are the people in Utah so accepting of Polynesian people then? They have African DNA, so why pick on biracial people like Dillon Brooks?"
Til Dillon brooks is metis
Dillon Brooks also known as Evil Danny Green.
Real fans know Maple Jordan is Dillon Brooks
"Agree, I‚Äôm just saying that he had higher expectations from last year and Dillon brooks improved more. Grizz were the 9th seed last year as well"
"Among those who accepted the camp invitations: Golden State‚Äôs Andrew Wiggins, New York‚Äôs RJ Barrett, Memphis‚Äô Dillon Brooks, Oklahoma City‚Äôs Luguentz Dort, Houston‚Äôs Kelly Olynyk, New Orleans‚Äô Nickeil Walker-Alexander, and Indiana‚Äôs Oshae Brissett.  For some, like Barrett and Brooks, availability will obviously hinge on how far their teams advance in the NBA playoffs.  ‚ÄúThere is no greater feeling in sports than the chance to represent your country on the highest international stage at the Olympic Games,‚Äù Canada senior men‚Äôs program general manager Rowan Barrett said. ‚ÄúOur players and staff fully recognize the unique opportunity that lies ahead of us and I would like to commend them for their dedication to playing for Canada this summer.‚Äù     Let's go"
"at least when it's ""rigged"" for the lakers they win the games, imagine the league rigging it for you to get in the playoffs but you cant beat Dillon brooks lmao"
Dillon Brooks is not a top 5 player. He's probably #7 at best.
"The thing is that there are a bunch of 50/50 calls that get called differently from game to game. In a game where the refs are letting them play through minimal contact and small touch fouls Dillon Brooks is incredibly effective. In a game like tonight where they‚Äôre calling essentially every little thing, his impact is minimized.  There are a half dozen things that could be called fouls on every possession, and the more egregious the foul the more likely it is to be called. It‚Äôs not black and white.  You are right though that this Grizzlies squad is a little too physical for how the game generally gets called today, but I also just have a huge problem with the NBA‚Äôs officiating policy in general. I hate foul baiting and I don‚Äôt think it should be rewarded ever. It is impossible to fight over a screen in today‚Äôs game and that is outrageous.  Dillons first two fouls were real soft, neither was a straight up incorrect call, just they were very soft, and I don‚Äôt like that stuff being called in a playoff game, and I think most people would rather watch physical basketball than foul baiting."
Dillon Brooks rocking #8 according to the team Canada store
"After last night? Nah, I literally saw Dillon Brooks soul leave his body when he realized he couldn't guard Donavon. I guess we will see how things go."
"Randle, RJ, Jordan Poole, Luka, Dillon Brooks, Robin Lopez"
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a Utah fan throws something at Dillon Brooks. I guess we‚Äôll wait and see.
"Wiggins won‚Äôt play.   Dillon Brooks, doubt it.  Thompson, probably not.  Maybe two ov those guys.  Hampton and ?"
"And Wiggins, RJ Barrett, NAW (Shai‚Äôs actual cousin), Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, and Dwight Powell. The only guys not going to training camp so far are Murray &amp; Shai. Murray must be faking too lol. According to you, Shai rests the entire back half of the season healthy, and is still skipping out on all the marketing and endorsements that would come from being THE guy for team Canada, in order to be ready for the tanking Thunder‚Äôs start of the season. How much rest does he need lol?"
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
It was tough seeing JV and brooks pick up quick fouls but we‚Äôre either of their first three really debatable? Just some dumb shit from Dillon and JV. They gotta be smarter with the fouls. Brooks fouled a three point shooter when he already had 2 and that‚Äôs pretty unforgivable IMO.
"I disagree.  I would happily take Jonas Valanciunas over either of them and Dillon Brooks is at least comparable to Lonzo.  Also, the Pelicans have Bledsoe which is an omegalul."
"* Ja Morant Says 'you know, I'm not afraid of nobody you know; Also calls Dillon brooks an 'Assasin you know'"
"He wouldn't be Dillon Brooks without that hair.  If anyone else did it I'd probably clown them, but with the sunglasses, the attitude, etc., it's just part of the package.  Gotta love it."
Dillon brooks is one of those guys I can‚Äôt tell whether or not is fat. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he had a six pack under his shirt or some man boobs.
Nah. I want to see Dillon Brooks fuck up Luka Doncic.
Dillon Brooks scratched from game 2 for exorcism
"Coming back after missing 20 games and facing Dillon Brooks, potentially at Memphis in a playoff atmosphere would be tough for anyone. Mitchell scares me though, he could just as easily drop 40 and I wouldn't be shocked."
dillon brooks would‚Äôve locked him up anyways
"No, Dillon Brooks is a man possesed. We need Spida in there to counteract that."
Villain Brooks  Evil Danny Green  Mirror Universe Dillon Brooks
"""My teammate just scored while you read this""  Dillon Brooks: FU-"
Irrational confidence Dillon brooks thinks he's Kobe Bryant...so rational confidence Dillon brooks...*is* Kobe Bryant? Welp league fucked
Grizz tried to trade MarShon Brooks. Suns thought they were getting Dillon lol  Teams called off the trade when they realized the mistake haha
"this is seriously getting overblown. Dillon Brooks looks up to Mike Conley, Dillon was his rook in Memphis. that head butt wasn't even aimed at Conley's head, he butted him in the chest. I doubt that hurt, that was just a friendly ""just cause we used to be teammates, I'm still coming at you"" gesture more than a cheap shot. right before that Dillon and Conley had a friendly exchange of trash talk. it was a nothing burger but cause it was Dillon Brooks, ppl are assuming it had bad intentions behind it"
Dillon ‚ÄúWario‚Äù Brooks
Danny Green with a jumpshot and good defense is Dillon Brooks
Dillon Brooks got that look in his eye that he normally gets when he plays the Timberwolves

Remember when Suns tried to finesse Dillon by acting like they didn‚Äôt know which player was meant by Brooks

How does Dillon Brooks not foul out every first quarter?
Everyone shitting on derozan this game when dillon brooks has 3 no calls on him alone lmao
Dillon Brooks got some Pat Bev to his game...foul constantly and dare the refs to call it. his offensive game is actually pretty nice though.
Dillon Brooks is pretty underrated
i like watching dillon brooks play
Dillon Brooks is evil Danny Green
Dillon brooks who was probably a fan of Derozan before he got into the league is costing him millions by how he‚Äôs clamping his ass up
"Valunciunas is feasting on the boards. Grizz went up by 20. Val sits and Grayson and the bench come on, Spurs take advantage and go on a 17-0 run. Val comes back, game gets tight. Dillon Brooks is locking up Derozan. Both teams are playing hustle defense."
Dillon Brooks plays like he thinks he's the best player on the court. First time watching him and I thought he was just a roleplayer.
"Hate to say it, but Dillon Brooks is locking up Derozan rn. Got me conflicted as a Canadian"

What is this commentary? Do they not know that Dillon Brooks is a capable scorer who is unafraid of jacking up shots?
Spots only need to roll and they banked in already. Dillon Brooks is going to be a star quit playing.
Such great revenue from this EXCITING tournament featuring some of the league's BIGGEST STARS like DILLON BROOKS
Dillon Brooks avoiding foul trouble is going to be the difference if the Grizzlies are gonna make the 8th seed.      He has his flaws but he's a confident shooter and a big time player that doesn't shy away from scoring. Something that's invaluable to this Memphis team.
DeRozan getting outplayed by Dillon Brooks certainly isn‚Äôt doing any favors for his playoff resume
spurs making Dillon Brooks look like prime Scottie Pippen rn he's doing everything out there
The world is finally getting to see the Dillon Brooks that Minnesota sees every single time we play the Grizzlies. The man turns into prime MJ
Dillon Brooks is either the worst player on the court or the best player in the league
