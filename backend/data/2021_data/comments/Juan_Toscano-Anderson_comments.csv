"Especially the ""will be out of the league"" stuff. Like if it was just ""fake tough guy"" or stuff like that fine who cares, but saying that about an undrafted guy, who fights for his NBA career is lame, especially when you do it to ""defend"" Juan Toscano Anderson who is in the exact same situation"
"Giannis, Seth Curry, Jimmy Butler, Alen Smailagic, Juan Toscano-Anderson"
"If the Warriors never drafted Smailagic and had an actual NBA center in his place on the roster, they could have won this game and would probably be a 4 seed right now.  Front office nepotism coming back to bite them as we watch Juan Toscano-Anderson play center. Love JTA though."
"Tough loss, but wanna give a shoutout to Juan Toscano-Anderson making the most of his minutes tonight.  Second leading scorer for the dubs tonight out of a player on a two-way contract who spent most of his career abroad.  Dude's got heart"
What you mean having Juan Toscano-Anderson as your second leading scorer isn't enough?
Juan Toscano-Anderson got a nasty floor burn
Juan Toscano-Anderson 😤 🇲🇽
Juan Toscano-Anderson needs minutes!
Juan Toscano-Anderson is the most diverse person in the nba
"My man Juan ""The Mexican Steph Curry"" Toscano-Anderson is on the floor."
Are we gonna act like Juan Toscano-Anderson isn't in a worse position tho? I mean sure Klay and Draymond are better players than McGruder but he's also had 10x a better career than Toscano-Anderson has and he started the whole thing
"Don't forget that the 6'9 center has an extensive injury history, one of the 6'6 guys had back spasms the other night, and the other one is clearly not up to par yet with his conditioning.  I don't even know who would be next in line for the center position. Juan Toscano-Anderson?"
/r/nba has been using acronyms for incredibly obscure players lately too.   Like yesterday somebody used JTA for that Juan Toscano Anderson guy. That's just one example.
What about Juan Toscano-Anderson? Is he allowed to talk?
"Juan Toscano-Anderson and I were in the same high school class.  We were never friends because we ran in different crowds.  We shared a couple of classes throughout the years, and he was always friendly and funny.    I just felt like sharing that.  We need some positivity in here."
"Juan Toscano-Anderson is a long ass name, and he is the only JTA in the league. But yea, I wouldn't expect anyone outside of the fandom to know JTA.....or even Juan Toscano-Anderson"
"&gt; The guy who started the talking was Juan Toscano-Anderson, not exactly one of ""the greats.""   I was talking about Klay and Dray, not Juan. They were talking trash to Rodney and they have a resume to back it up."
"&gt; The greats earn the right to talk trash  The guy who started the talking was Juan Toscano-Anderson, not exactly one of ""the greats.""   Legit players getting dragged into an argument between 2 scrubs (Juan and Rodney) is like the start of WW1."
"&gt; Juan Toscano-Anderson said something to Wayne Ellington in the first quarter.  Wow, you'd expect better from the legendary Juan ""91 career points"" Toscano-Anderson. He's probably gonna be out of the league soon. Why is he trying to start something like he's good or something?"
"I saw Warriors fans referring to ""JTA"" the other day as if people are supposed to know what those initials mean. I knew they were talking about Juan Toscano-Anderson but c'mon."
Juan Toscano Anderson I guess
You don't come at Juan Toscano-Anderson in the Bay
"He talked shit to Juan Toscano-Anderson, his name's gonna be mud in the Bay. McGruder better keep his ass out of Oakland.  Certain Pistons player don't seem to have taken getting blown the fuck out of the building very well."
"They do now.  I don't know of McGruder having offended Klay prior to McGruder committing crimes against Juan Toscano-Anderson.  McGruder now has beef with, potentially, ""Oakland""."
Juan Toscano Anderson. It’s a very long name.
juan toscano-anderson
"I'm a warriors fan and I don't know who the fuck Juan Toscano-Anderson is. First time i saw it here, I thought it was a joke."
Juan Toscano-Anderson. One of our two-way guys
"JTA is fine as well because who else could it be... If people don't recognize who JTA is in the context of a Warriors game, how will they know who Juan Toscano-Anderson is?"
"He was trying to fight Juan Toscano Anderson, who didn’t even suit for the game. So macgruder comes into the game, only gets into a 30 point blowout during garbage time, gets his pocket picked and then tries to fight a g-leaguer in street clothes after the game."
Juan Toscano-Anderson backup guard for the Warriors.
"looks like he went up to Juan Toscano-Anderson and asks him ""what happened?"""
"Dude was coming at his teammate (Juan Toscano-Anderson) and wanted smoke after the game, that’s why Klay was saying that"
Juan Toscano-Anderson is what it looked like
"It's just about a month long, feel like he'd benefit a ton from the extra playing time. Plus he's only on a two-way contract anyways, so we'll probably just be having Juan Toscano-Anderson active while he's gone.  It will cut our only backup PG down to Wanamaker though, and it's not like he's a true PG. Should be interesting, maybe it convinces the FO to pull the trigger on an Oubre trade sooner than later."
"But even in 2015 and 2016, bogut, shaun, and andre were great but the overall team depth was a little overblown, lot of those guys were unplayable at times. The top 7-8 guys were better back then but this team is legitimately 10 deep not including Oubre who has been ass for most of the season. I think Wiggins has been a great fit so far and then we have guys like Damian Lee, Eric Paschall, Bazemore, Looney, and even Brad Wanamaker who have been really good for us in their roles both on offense and defense. Even fringe rotation guys and 2 way players like Mulder and Juan Toscano Anderson have contributed both ways in their limited minutes. And most of these guys have done it both in the 2nd unit and with the starters.   In fact in many games, the starters are the ones who fall behind early and our bench is the unit who brings it back. The last few years our bench was pretty bad at scoring, their role was to just buy time for Steph to come back into the game, whereas now our bench actually can get buckets, cut into a deficit or even extend leads. Our starters have been the problem tbh, mostly due to Oubre and Wiseman"
"Don't forget Looney, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Wanamaker, and Mulder with some quality defense off the bench. Damion Lee is coming into his own too."
"These first 10-15 or so games are basically summer league, training camp, and preseason for a team returning only two other players with substantial experience playing with Steph (Draymond, Looney). Every win in this beginning stretch, even against supposedly ""bad"" teams, are going to be huge as this team figures itself out throughout the season. These ""bad"" defensive teams are when the Warriors and Kerr will have the luxury to tinker and experiment.  I see this season as a ""luxury"" rebuild year. We'll likely have two first-round picks next year to add to a developing young talent in Wiseman. Other young players will build valuable experience playing with Steph and Draymond as they age into the twilight of their careers, and we'll be able to evaluate them before we ease Klay back in hopefully next year. The ""luxury"" bit comes with the fact that we have very a real chance to make the playoffs while still being able to add strong talent near the top of the draft next year.  Some of my takeaways of the roster so far from 7 games:  * Steph is still Steph. He usually starts the season cold and heats up around the ASB, but he will be pressed early and often this year. Prayers up for his health, I still cringe every time he drives into traffic trying to do it all for this team's offense. * Draymond still contributes in so many ways outside of the box score. Offensively you already see his impact as Steph's partner in the PnR and with the dimes. Our defense is worlds better with him in there barking and directing traffic. I don't know what else he can do to show he can be a floor-raiser on the defensive end.  * Wiseman still looks lost out there but him just being on the floor impacts the game. He's only going to get better throughout the year as he develops chemistry and adjusts to the speed of the NBA game. * Wiggins is performing exactly to my expectations so far this year and still has room to grow. Again, we'll have to hold our breaths here for sustained effort, but we've now got a 19 game sample size of Warriors Wiggins (12 games last year) where he's averaged 18.7p/4.9r/3.1a/1.0s/1.4b on splits of .438/.359/.685 and he's not taking any of Steph's minutes or touches at PG. Still got that MIN first rounder coming next year too... * Kelly, you pretty motherfucker. His shot will regress back to the mean eventually, but he sure does love driving into traffic to throw up bad shots. Good effort, and we may be able to retain him past this year on a reasonable contract with his Bird Rights. * With Chriss' unfortunate injury, Paschall has been thrust into minutes as a bench small-ball C which has completely opened up his offensive game. I'm seeing shades of the Carl Landry/Mo Speights/David West role for him moving forward * Looney's experience playing with Steph helps him stay on the floor against other bench Cs and he finally looks valuable again. His experience in the playoffs shows in his defensive effort against penetration. So glad we don't have to start him anymore, though. * Damion Lee has won me over. I think he can be a solid last man on the bench on any team in the league with his shooting ability, and has shown some real swagger lately with clutch shooting. I can't be upset with him playing 10-15 minutes per game if needed. * Mychal Mulder, my goodness. The man can catch-and-shoot off screens just like Steph and Klay. He's going to see a lot more minutes and trust from Kerr moving forward. * Chriss' injury has also opened up a spot for Juan Toscano-Anderson. I'm not really sure what position he plays to be honest, but I like what I've seen from him in his limited time. Not to conjure up more ""Andre 2.0"" memes, but I love the confident way he brings the ball up on breaks like Andre used to, which opened up Steph/Klay corner threes on the break. Defensively he's got good energy and decent hands. * Bazemore's energy is great and will be a good veteran piece backing up the wing spots. * Wannamaker has been good in his role, no complaints. Just a steady hand at backup PG. * Poole still doesn't look ready with the ball in his hands, but I've seen him do a lot of good things with the ball despite the shaky handle and decision-making. He's a wild card and still needs development time, but I can still see the potential for a backup combo guard."
1. Mychal Mulder 2. Juan Toscano Anderson 3. Brad Wannamaker 4. Jordan Poole 5. Damion Lee 6. Alan Smailagic 7. Nico Manion
"Don't forget Warrior legend and household name Juan Toscano-Anderson who was waived and then signed on a 2 way days after, then asked to start the next game lmao"
He's on the roster. Juan Toscano Anderson and Nico are our two-way players
It'll be tough for Curry when Juan Toscano-Anderson starts pulling some votes as well.
"Juan Toscano-Anderson scored like 4PPG in college as a guard and now is in the NBA. Maybe he killed it in G-league tryouts and practice, no matter how much nepotism there is you don't get to step foot on an NBA court off name alone, you gotta be an elite ball player"
"&gt;no secret Wiggins has gotten off to a horrible start this year. In his defense, this is because he’s a horrible player and It’s not his fault people keep expecting more from him.  Are you watching the games or just reading reddit? Besides the first game, he actually has been playing well.  Solid defensively and playing within the offense. Oubre on the other hand has been a mess offensively. Don't confuse the two. If you want to go into how he played in minnesota, then sure, I'd agree with you. But his time on the warriors hasn't been as ""horrible"" as you and the rest of the reddit world are trying to make it out to be.  &gt;People need to face reality. The Warriors management needs to face reality. This is a terrible roster and Steph is 32. He doesn’t have 3 years to rebuild.  Terrible roster or is it a young roster that hasn't developed chemistry yet through 5 games? The warriors have one of the youngest rosters in the league. People want to talk about Steph, Klay, and dray, but the warriors of past had a lot of solid veterans who had tons of playoff experience in the league. The starting lineup currently has three players who are playing with the warriors for the first time. Before Draymond played yesterday, you had a lineup of oubre, wiggins, wiseman, and gleaguer juan toscano anderson. Again, young dudes who've never played with Steph or been on rosters with championship experience. Is it strange to think that it might take more than 5 games to develop chemistry? Not really?  The teams currently 2-3, so record wise the warriors are still in the thick of things after 5 games. Moreover, the three blowout losses came against the nets, buckets, and blazers. Two teams who've played with each other for years and the nets with two of the best players in the league that also have championship experience. Not surprising again that a team playing together in their first regular season game after a shortened off-season gets smashed by them.     I agree with one thing"
"We are finding out once KD left the Warriors management aren't light years ahead of the league. They couldn't replace Andre Iguodala a wing who can guard perimeter on defense, and switch if they need to. On offense he can be ball handler, playmaker, cutter, and good screener. Shaun Livingston veteran point guard who help the bench handle the ball, get buckets in midrange with his height and length, make necessary passes, set good screens, and can defend the perimeter. They don't have a big who can defend the paint well like Bogut or Durant. Who else on this team you are scare of shooting or make good decisions on the court consistently besides Curry? All 4 games warriors are getting cooked by their opponents, and they can barely get any stops. Curry gravity is still lethal, but his gravity can't overcompensate flawed players in Andrew Wiggins, Kent Bazemore, Damion Lee, Kevon Looney, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, Kelly Oubre Jr, Eric Paschall, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brad Wanamaker, Draymond Green, and James Wiseman against good teams"
That dude you don't know is probably Juan Toscano-Anderson

"Juan Toscano Anderson will be the Finals MVP, mark my words"
"It's really tough to say because like I said, it's a real lost art. If you sort by cutting action frequency, everyone ahead of Bruce Brown is a PF/C (which means their cuts are usually just coming from the paint area while Brown has to time his cuts from way further out usually). Juan Toscano-Anderson caught my eye from watching random Warriors games but I haven't seen enough to know if he's consistently great at it and I have similar observations about Brandon Clarke and Jae'Sean Tate but Warriors, Grizzlies, and Rockets fans can probably really tell it better than I can from watching the occasional League Pass games of each team."
"Duncan Robinson was on the bench behind DJ Wilson at Michigan. Juan Toscano-Anderson was a bench rider on the Marquette team lead by Vander Blue like what, eight years ago? NCAA only tells you so much."
"All three are players who aren't as consistent as the top tier players.  Oubre and Draymond are definitely rhythm players who thrive on constant chaos on the basketball court, Draymond doing it with his intelligence and making excellent decisions in real time, and Oubre making plays with his elite athleticism.  Both Draymond and Oubre while trying to make great plays end up making very poor ones, and if this is happening in the same quarter, the Warriors can implode.  Still, their energy gets a bunch of very nice runs and comebacks going(also a reason I like Juan Toscano-Anderson as a player, energy).  Out of all your descriptions, I think Wiggins is probably the farthest off.  He's benefited greatly from not being a primary option on both ends because although he is good, he isn't necessarily great at anything yet.  His offensive statistics are ok, his defense is good, but does have issues, but truly he hasn't really improved much from his stats his entire career.  There are minuscule differences in his stats from previous years, and I think he's probably a bit more patient, but he still takes some horrible shots, particularly in the 4th quarter, especially turnaround, fadaway ISOs that don't have a great chance of going in.  Rather see ball movement as it's the primary way the Warriors conduct offense.      Wiggins shoot at the league average now which is nice, but I imagine the splits between when Curry is on/off could be helping that a bit.  He's almost the same player as he was when he was as a rookie, except he's now at a career low amount of shots within 0-3 feet(21.3% of his shots at the basket, career average is 27.4%).      Do I think Wiggins is a decent player? Yes.  I don't think he's done much different since he entered the league except slightly increase his efficiency each year until it's reached average.  There is more data on him since he entered the league than almost every player than Lebron at his age.  He's 74th on the active list in minutes played.  He's played more  regular season minutes than Kawhi, Draymond, the Morris brothers, KCP, and CJ McCollum.  The book might not be completely written on Wiggins yet, but if anyone doesn't know who Wiggins is by now, they probably don't watch basketball.  Draymond and Oubre can elevate the team, and also crash it down, Wiggins is a shorter Marvin Williams who shoots more."
I’m guessing you mean Juan Toscano-Anderson
"I read the article, it's stupid. It's basically arguing that employees should have the right to determine if and when they work. We have a term for that type of setup, it's called ""self-employed.""  &gt; The Cavs took him out of the lineup because it’s the best thing for their team. But if Drummond had demanded a trade and chose to limit his own minutes to do what’s best for Drummond – sort of like what James Harden just did in Houston – the narrative would have been much different.  If Drummond wanted to sit out, nobody could or would stop him. No one's gonna put a gun to his head and force him to play. However, there are contractual penalties that come with refusing to work in the NBA, the same as there are for refusing to work in any other job. If Frank Vogel or Pat Riley or Doc Rivers refused to do their job, they'd also face penalties.   NBA contracts are payment for services rendered, it's not just free money for being a cool person. You don't render the service, you suffer a financial penalty. If Tom Cruise signs a contract to star in a movie and then backs out halfway through filming, there's financial penalties for him doing so.   &gt; “At some point, as players, we need to be treated with the same respect. And have the same rights that the team can have,” Green said.   If players have the same rights that teams have, does Dame get to make roster cuts and draft picks for the Blazers? Can Jordan Poole trade away Steph? Can Lebron relocate the Lakers to Akron? Does Draymond have to revenue-share his salary with Juan Toscano-Anderson?"
Someone do an animorphs style photoshop of Draymond -&gt; Ben -&gt; Lebron...Juan Toscano Anderson is kind of like a Kirkland Draymond so you could even start with him
"For starters, the Warriors are easy to love, plain and simple. Steph, Bazemore, Wiggins, Klay, Juan Toscano-Anderson, and the sexy little slut Steve Kerr are easy to love.   Second, Kerr's offensive system, facilitated by Draymond and Steph, is beautiful due to all the off-ball movement that takes advantage of Steph's gravity on the defense.  Third, Steph. Curry."
"I love Eric Paschal  I love Kent Bazemore  I love Andrew Wiggins  I love Kelly Oubre Jr.  I love Juan Toscano-Anderson  I love Steph Curry  I love that all these guys feel like they've got extra pride wearing these uniforms and playing for this team. On a night that Steph was shooting horribly the rest of the team came together and made plays, made big shots, came up with huge rebounds and came back in a big way. These guys are just getting better and everyone's really coming together as a unit and I'm excited for everything to come."
Sorry his name was a bit long to type in.  Juan Toscano Anderson
Curry isn’t even the happiest on his team Juan Toscano Anderson is genuinely happy to be on the floor every second he’s out there.
"Oh shoot, they are interviewing Mexican League MVP Juan Toscano-Anderson!"
Juan Toscano Anderson
Cuz Juan Toscano Anderson is the mf GOAT
"Notice no response  Curry stans have literally no logical consistency to any of the arguments they're spewing on here.   There are people arguing Harden playing with Russell Westbrook, CP3, and Dwight Howard at different points in their career while they were all outta their primes, often injured and bad at the most important times (Dwight hurt and mediocre in 15 &amp; 16 playoffs, CP3 hurt in 18 playoffs, mediocre in 19 Playoffs, Russ hurt mediocre in 2020 playoffs).....  is somehow equivalent to Steph playing with Klay, KD, Draymond and Iggy all relatively in their primes for years. Bullshit. Then there's people claiming Steph has to play with Juan Toscano Anderson while implying Harden's worst role players were guys like Eric Gordon when in reality they were guys like this:  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dorsejo01.html)  Notice his only season with Harden was his last season in the NBA. Harden had to play 70 games with a guy who was so bad he dropped out of the league forever afterwards.  Jesus, the lengths people go to defend Curry at all costs. You can still acknowledge Curry is better and all without lying about objective facts"
"You're really out here acting like a team giving heavy minutes to Brad Wanamaker, Mychal Mulder, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano Anderson (who is great but he's 6 months removed from the g-league) is the same as those Houston teams."
"Leading FGA on each team  Bruce Brown, Juan Toscano-Anderson"
"that's Juan ""Steph's teammate"" Toscano-Anderson for you sir"
Juan Toscano-Anderson looks like a boxer that grew too tall. Lol. Or imagine stepping in the ring with 6'10 250lbs Gustavo Ayon.
"Warriors fans really dislike Alen Smailagic, in large part because his roster spot is being used and we'd rather get Juan Toscano-Anderson that full contract spot instead of his two-way."
"When people say Juan Toscano, I always think of Fawn Moscato. Those names are so similar. But saying Juan Toscano-Anderson is fine though lol"
"[Here you go! ](https://theundefeated.com/features/juan-toscano-anderson-still-cant-believe-hes-on-the-warriors/) I’m not sure if it’s the same article, but this is also a great article on him that I read last night :)"
Warriors Started Juan Toscano Anderson and Dray at the 5 the past couple weeks lol. They haven't had a center for like 2 weeks.
Kind of. He made the G League team at an open tryout. It comes down to the G League coaching staff understanding the organization’s playing philosophy. This undefeated article about Juan T is great https://theundefeated.com/features/juan-toscano-anderson-still-cant-believe-hes-on-the-warriors/
"That's a good question, especially since Juan Toscano-Anderson was also open enough to take the shot."
"my new favorite warrior, Juan Toscano-Anderson      He's a wholesome man &lt;3"
For anyone who wants a deeper dive on JTA there's a good [athletic](https://theathletic.com/2365185/2021/02/04/warriors-juan-toscano-anderson?source=user-shared-article) article on him. General gist is the dude is a grinder whose really improved his game. Interesting look a g league development as well. He's also a bay native which you love to see.
I've been pleasantly surprised with the play of JTA (Juan Toscano-Anderson) this year. You can see he really loves getting to learn from Steph

You're not wrong.  Another example is Juan Toscano Anderson passing up a wide open three to pass it across to an open Steph instead.
I thought this was asking about players on two way contracts and I was here to say Juan Toscano Anderson
"I dunno were we watching the same game? Warriors had fight, Juan Toscano Anderson added a much needed spark, Draymond played amazing defense whole game, Curry lit it up and everyone else contributed all around. I thought it was great effort all around except that 2nd quarter."
Juan Toscano Anderson should be a captain of the All-star team

"Warriors fans enlighten me, why is Juan Toscano Anderson starting? You have better players at his position even with injuries"
"You’re telling me Damion Lee, Juan Toscano Anderson, Nico Mannion, Mychal Mulder, and Jordan Poole would all get minutes on other teams when we picked up half of them up from the G League?"
"The frustrating thing is that the Warriors have a good candidate to soak up front-court minutes. Juan Toscano-Anderson should be getting playing time, especially against smaller centers."
"As you can see by the table below, Curry and Draymond are doing their best to right a sinking ship. Bazemore probably has such a high On-Off because he usually comes in for Oubre (or Wiggins) and as such, doesn't have to play with Wiseman as much.  I'm also surprised they don't give Mychal Mulder more minutes.  |||||Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|Posi|+/-|+/-| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Rk|Player|G|MP|PG%|SG%|SF%|PF%|C%|OnCourt|On-Off| |1|Andrew Wiggins|50|1617|||48%|48%|4%|-4.0|-5.0| |2|Kelly Oubre|48|1468||35%|39%|25%|1%|-5.5|-8.1| |3|Stephen Curry|42|1419|86%|14%||||+2.2|+11.4| |4|Draymond Green|42|1273||||65%|35%|+1.3|+7.9| |5|Damion Lee|49|927|1%|62%|35%|3%||-1.9|+0.8| |6|Kent Bazemore|48|784||33%|51%|15%|1%|+6.5|+13.1| |7|James Wiseman|36|781|||||100%|-10.7|-12.5| |8|Eric Paschall|39|676||||33%|67%|-7.2|-6.7| |9|Brad Wanamaker|39|625|66%|33%|1%|||0.0|+3.1| |10|Juan Toscano-Anderson|35|609||49%|42%|8%||-2.0|+0.4| |11|Kevon Looney|39|599|||||100%|+2.4|+6.3| |12|Jordan Poole|29|505|28%|58%|13%|1%||-8.4|-7.6| |13|Mychal Mulder|41|412|86%|14%||||+1.7|+4.8| |14|Nico Mannion|19|275|100%|||||-11.0|-9.7|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2021.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#pbp) Generated 4/5/2021."
Juan Toscano Anderson has chosen violence
"I had to look up who the fuck is Juan Toscano-Anderson... I’m not saying I disagree with him, but how would he know what it takes for someone to become a monster?"
Juan Toscano-Anderson is not a degenerate piece of filth who deserves to die.
juan toscano anderson out here talking like I 20 year vet and ive never even heard of him.  who is this guy
there’s no offense to run without steph?? you think draymond is whipping it to jordan poole or juan toscano-anderson?    why make a discussion post if you’re just gonna bitch at people that don’t agree with you lmao clown
https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/12/juan-toscano-anderson-steph-curry-call-out-bleacher-report-espn-on-twitter/
"Amazing:   * Curry with 32/6/9 on his 33rd bday. Just needed 1 more point my man  * Andrew Wiggins 28/3/2 - all he needed was a few day's rest! Looking fresh post-ASB  * Poole - 18/3 in 22 minutes - this guy could turn into 6MOY next season. Oozes scoring potential.   Great:   * Draymond 11/12/12 - still hopeless offensively but actually hitting a few shots now. Still anchoring the D. Keep doing your thing man   * Nico 5/2/2 in 12 minutes. Showed very promising flashes of talent as a pass-first PG who can hit his shots when needed. Good D already. Just turned 20 today! Cool that both PGs have the same Bday  * Wiseman 16/3 in 23 minutes.  Still lots to work on but he looks better than he did earlier in the year. Desperately needs to learn to rebound against grown men though. And to box out. And to set better screens.   Good:   * Eric Paschall: 9/3/1 in 12 minutes. Put his limited time to work. Such a reliable bench scorer already. Defense needs to keep improving though  * Looney: 2/3 in 11 minutes. You do all the little things bb, I wont complain.   Alright:   * Oubre 7/7/1 in 30 minutes. Deferred on offense today, and probably a good idea. Not his best night at the office but still played good D and never turned the ball over  * Bazemore: 3/1/1 - plays his role off the bench  * Juan Toscano-Anderson 0/2/0 in 11 minutes. Still trying to figure it out consistently. I think he has the tools to be a goo contributor  Fuck off:   * Brad Wanamaker - 0/0/0 in 0 minutes. No offense, you are so trash. Part of the reason we won is because you're on the end of the bench now. 20 year old Nico is a better backup PG. Go play overseas homie.   Good win today! Most exciting ball we've played in a long time. Guess we really needed the ASB rest. We're still in playoff contention y'all. We Believe"
"Would rather meme their whole bench lineup instead. We've got Nico ""Ginger Mamba"" Mannion, Damion ""Nepotism/Splash Step Bro."" Lee, Wannabricker, James ""Big Jim"" Wiseman, and Juan ""Steph's Teammate"" Toscano-Anderson."
"Our second unit includes Nico Mannion, Jordan Poole, and Juan Toscano Anderson. Three actual g-league players."
Juan Toscano-Anderson about to take over the league.
"**Exact moment we lost this game:** A lineup of Nico Mannion, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano Anderson, Eric Paschall, and Kelly Oubre for 7+ minutes in the second quarter scored 6 points, allowed the lead to balloon from 2 to 13, and not one substitution was made."
"It's not even pressure. It's pure frustration.   We had a lineup of Nico Mannion, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano Anderson, Eric Paschall, and Kelly Oubre for 7+ minutes in the second quarter where the lead ballooned from 2 to 13 and not one substitution was made."
WHAAAATT you mean Juan Toscano Anderson ISNT as good as Robert Covington or Joe Harris
Juan Toscano Anderson is NOT G League level
"&gt;  NBA greats Juan Toscano-Anderson   I warn you sir, that I consider this level of sarcasm regarding Mr.  Toscano-Anderson to be near to a dueling matter!  I urge you to desist as it is highly improbable that I am any good at dueling and don't want you to hurt me."
He wouldn't even have three assists if it weren't for playing with NBA greats Juan Toscano-Anderson and Alen Smailagič  Washed
"One day, he will wake up, pick up his phone. He will see lots of notifications. Then he will anxiously open Twitter, just to see a guy with glasses tweeted ""BREAKING: The Warriors trades Juan Tocsano-Andersen for 2nd round pick and cash considerations, sources tell ESPN"", then another tweet, ""TOSCANO-ANDERSON""  This league is ruthless."
"Actually, a few months ago:  [Juan Toscano-Anderson is a true Oaklander. Some more proof: After tonight's game, while complimenting Steph Curry, he said, ""I'll be honest. When the Warriors traded Monta Ellis, I was kind of salty."" (via Letourneau)](https://twitter.com/Con_Chron/status/1359360275397287939)"
"I think you tell the league what name you want to go by and they usually agree. (I imagine if Andre Drummond wanted to be become Shitface McReboundPussy Adam Silver would slap him). But guys like Juan Toscano-Anderson can choose to just have Toscano on the back, or in baseball Giancarlo Stanton went by Mike (middle name) for a few years before switching to his first name, or BJ Upton who went by that nickname for a longtime before switching to his real name Melvin. Then guys like Buster Posey who goes by his nickname, his real name is Gerald.   Don’t know why three baseball examples came to me but it’s the same difference."
I fucking love Juan Toscano-Anderson. My mans playing like he willing to die for the Dubs. Budget Dray
One person: Juan Toscano Anderson  He’s IQ is incredible. Also a passing savant and the third most versatile defender in our team (after Dray and Wiggs). He’s absolutely incredible
Juan Toscano-Anderson sign my ~~toaster~~ rabbit
Lol you blatantly just made that shit up. What they said is that CP3 likes to go for the rip through foul call which is a savvy vet move and that Juan Toscano Anderson has to be a better job of keeping his hands in.
Juan Toscano-Anderson will hit the floor behind the scorer's table and take a monitor to the head before any of those dudes.
"Yes. Didn't he play limited minutes at C or at least defend Cs during the small ball experiment from the Rockets? If Juan Toscano Anderson can ""play"" C, then Harden can ""play"" C. I joked in the offseason that Harden would be a better defensive C than Wiseman and, now that we've seen him play, that might actually be true."
Probably Juan Toscano Anderson but I've seen it as JTA but never TCA
"The Nuggets also have Michael Porter Jr, Aaron Gordon, Paul Milsap, Will Barton, Monte Morris, Javale McGee, and Jamal Murray (for half of the year).     The Warriors 4th and 5th guys rotate between Mychal Mulder, Juan Toscano Anderson, and Kent Bazemore. Not taking away from Jokic having an incredible year, but when you’re talking about their team records you’ve gotta see that there’s a pretty massive talent difference between the two teams lol."
And then they select Juan Toscano-Anderson in the expansion draft
Juan Toscano-Anderson wil be GOAT before season is over IMO.
Juan Toscano Anderson
I’m seeing more Igoudala comparisons with Juan Toscano Anderson. Did you see those swipe downs last night?
"Juan Toscano-Anderson is a SG according to the NBA, and he’s turned out to be a decent big man.  Warriors make everyone a big man eventually."
"A video of Juan Toscano-Anderson talking about Curry got as many upvotes as the Lakers winning their title last year lmao.  This sub only feels like r/Lakers because we were so dominant last year/the beginning of the season. Since LeBron and AD went down, this sub definitely hasn’t been a hive for anything remotely pro-Lakers."
Surprised it wasn’t Juan Toscano-Anderson
"Dray, looney and Juan Toscano Anderson."
The pride of Oakland Juan Toscano Anderson
"It depends on what you mean by value. Having four starters with &lt;0 OBPM doesn't by itself mean they are net negatives - you aren't inherently getting outscored - but in terms of opportunity cost, you likely are missing out on opportunities with better players.   2nd - in the case of the Warriors, most of their roster is actually approaching replacement level (-2) offensively.   Look at their OBPM, of the players with the most minutes. Wiggens (-0.2), Draymond (-2.2), Oubre (-1.5), Bazemore (-2.8), Looney (-1.8), Juan Toscano-Anderson (-1.8), Wiseman (-4.0)  Sure I simplified for the purpose of the title, but that Warriors team is full of players who are awful offensively."
"Juan Toscano-Anderson, although he's been receiving attention lately."
"1) Draymond is one of the best (if not the best) off-ball defenders in the league as well as a great on-ball defender.  2) Wiggins is a great defender. For a majority of the season he was the leading non-center blocker of the league.  3) Juan Toscano-Anderson who essentially is a mini-Draymond who can shoot better who's finally getting some well deserved recognition.  4) Oubre is a great energy guy that can essentially guard any position.  5) Looney is great defender (I think he's dropped a little but if you recall Warriors vs Rockets in every playoff series in the last 4 years, the Rockets are always switching Harden to be guarded by Looney and overall Looney did great).  At any point in the game, at least 3 of these 5 dudes are on the court at a time which makes up for the lesser defenders who foul a metric crapton."
Steph probably has the edge but I think you guys are kinda disrespecting Juan Toscano-Anderson here
"So basically the nuggets now are what the Warriors would be without the **real** MVPs, Juan Toscano-Anderson and Jordan Poole"
"nah man, steph curry has never played on a team without 4 all stars. i mean look at the incredible all star talent on this team like Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Draymond Green and Juan Toscano Anderson.   If he ever plays on a team with no talent there's no way he'd ever get to .500 or even make the playoffs"
Mvp-jokic dominated by draymond and juan toscano anderson tonight.....so.   Not mvp
"The big thing is that the Warriors have given a combined 1750 minutes or so to players (Wiseman, Wanamaker, and Mannion) who aren't even close to being NBA-quality players; roughly 12% of player-minutes that the Warriors have played so far this season.  I don't think there is any real precedent for this on a fringe playoff team.  Somehow Wanamaker actually has OK on/off stats but has probably failed the eye test worse than any player I've ever seen.  No Juan Toscano-Anderson slander though, there's a reasonable argument that he's been one of the 5 best players on the Warriors this season."
"Lamar Odom.  Smush was crazy (fighting a parking lot attendant) and had a silly name but he could score.  Do you think he was so much worse than Juan Toscano-Anderson, Booby Gibson, Kenny Thomas or any other crappy starter on a shallow team?"
"Translation: ""You see these bums? Fuckin Kelly Oubre and Juan Toscano Anderson? How am I winning with these dudes?"""
"No. Draymond Green and Wiseman was better than everybody on that Kobe led team. I agree that Curry is having a ridiculous season and comparable potentially better individually season, but arguably the third best player on those Lakers was Smush Parker. You're taking Smush Parker over Wiseman(when healthy), Wiggins or Looney? Arguably Juan Toscano-Anderson is better than Smush as well. But he's injured as well. If we say Green and Odom are a wash, the supporting cast around Curry is much better than Kobe's."
"You're thinking of Juan Toscano-Anderson, who is currently on a two-way contract (not a 10-day contract like Gary Payton II)."
"Wiseman wasn't good pre injury, in fact he was awful. Other guy is right ab Dray, he's a facilitator but it's not that helpful with nobody else. Wiggins is a good rotational piece, not the second focal point on offense (which he is rn, after Steph). Oubre is competent that's literally it, Looney kinda too but it's not like he creates offense (although Oubre only creates badly lmao) and he's been hurt a lot of the year. Our third or fourth best player might seriously be Jordan Poole, who's a happy surprise this year he's gonna be great in the future. After that it's barely NBA players, I mean we're getting a lot of minutes from: Juan Toscano-Anderson (love him tho), Bazemore, Mannion, formerly Wanamaker, Mulder, Damion Lee. I'm talking more offensively than defensively but seriously scroll through our roster on the warriors site.  I think you have a slightly inflated view of Oubre, Looney, and Wiggins + Looney has been hurt, and a very inflated view of Wiseman. Also after those guys, Dray, and Poole, literally everyone sucks and the only ones who kinda show promise are Poole and Paschall and even the latter is kinda doubtful to me."
Juan Toscano Anderson looks like Seth Rogan?
&gt; Shoutout Juan Toscano-Anderson. Dude would've gotten a standing ovation from the entire city of Boston for that play if he wore green  I thought I heard people in the crowd clapping when he finally got up.
Juan Toscano Anderson
Juan Toscano Anderson appreciation.
Finals MVP to Juan Toscano Anderson
Juan Toscano-Anderson died for this
Celtics - Warriors games have been consistently incredible for the last 6 years   Tatum vs Curry was so much fun to watch  Shoutout Juan Toscano-Anderson. Dude would've gotten a standing ovation from the entire city of Boston for that play if he wore green
"Juan ""Hanamichi Sakuragi"" Toscano-Anderson"
Prayers for Juan Toscano Anderson. My man is a literal warrior like I’m legitimately teary eyed seeing him put his body out on the line. Please give him A BIG FAT contract. 🙌🏽
Does Earl Watson not count? He is half-Mexican American half-African American like Juan Toscano-Anderson.
"Mark Aguirre, Horacio Llamas, Eduardo Najera, Jorge Gutierrez, Gustavo Ayon, Devin Booker, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
"Juan ""The Juan"" Toscano Anderson"
It’s just imo a guy like Juan Toscano-Anderson is gonna be more valuable. I just think Oubre isn’t gonna be worth whatever you overpay for him to stay. There are other ways you can improve while being over the cap. Trading a pick for him and spending 80m extra was a mistake that should be moved on from
I want to see Juan Toscano Anderson taking the other 50%
JUAN TOSCANO ANDERSON
"I see Juan Toscano-Anderson, I upvote."
Juan Toscano Anderson and Rodney
Usually on the Spanish broadcasts they know Juan Toscano-Anderson because they always bring up that he’s Mexican. I assume to appeal to potential fans that way.
and his first mate Juan De Fuca Toscano-Anderson
"The problem with the ""injuries were caused because the players played too much"" argument is who is getting hurt.   Kawhi sat out 20 games. Anthony Davis only played 36. Harden played 36, too. And Kyrie sat out, what, 19?  Conley missed around 20 and had regular rest during the season. Murray's injury came after he had not played for several games, so it clearly wasn't an overuse injury.   CP3's loss is obviously not related to over-use.   So basically you've got only a couple of star injuries which could plausibly be connected to playing too much and the schedule. Mitchell, maybe. Luka, maybe. Embiid, maybe. But it's quite common to see some star players battling injuries in the playoffs (Kyrie in 2015, Steph in 2016, CP3 in 2018, KD in 2019).   The thing about shortening the schedule - and this is the tough part - is that the players it hurts the most are the younger, non-star players. The money lost wouldn't have had any impact on the lives of LeBron or CP3's grandchildren, but it would make a huge difference to guys like Juan Toscano Anderson and Bruce Brown.   This rash of injuries sucks, big time - but the cause-and-effect is murky, at best."
I saw JT A and assumed he meant Juan Toscano Anderson
"Ummm what? As far as giving CP his credit I said:  &gt; CP3 is amazing and wherever he goes more wins follow every time   My argument wasn't even against CP3, I tried to show how highly I regard him as a player many times throughout my argument, my argument was against ""floor raiser/ceiling raiser"" as a legit talking point.  And yeah obviously getting the 2 seed is better than the 9 seed, but flip the players and what happens? CP does not lead GS to 39 wins, and Curry on the Suns makes them the best team in the league, which goes totally in line with my whole argument where I said great players are great players, but how far they go depends on their supporting casts, and CP's supporting cast this season with Booker, Ayton, Bridges, et al., is WAAAAY better than Draymond and Juan Toscano Anderson."
"Here's what they each did FWIW.  **Carmelo Anthony**  &gt; Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade created the Social Change Fund in July 2020. The organization works to address social and economic issues facing Black communities. Anthony is also a member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition.   **Harrison Barnes**  &gt; Before the 2020 presidential election, Barnes worked with Be.Woke.Vote, a voting campaign aimed at historically disenfranchised young people. He also pledged $200,000 to organizations and foundations that combat police brutality and racial inequality. The 29-year-old also is partnered with a Black-owned finance app and opened savings accounts for 500 students in Dallas and Sacramento.   **Tobias Harris**  &gt; Harris awarded $300,000, through the Tobias Harris Charitable Fund, to The Fund for the School District of Philadelphia to recruit teachers from historically Black colleges and universities. He also created the Tobias' Top Teachers program, which funds professional development workshops and purchases classroom supplies for teachers to help recruit Black male educators.   **Jrue Holiday**  &gt; Holiday established the Jrue and Lauren Holiday Social Impact Fund in response to COVID-19 and global anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd. The fund provided grants to 50 Black-owned businesses and Black-led organizations in New Orleans, Indianapolis and Los Angeles.   **Juan Toscano-Anderson**  &gt; Toscano-Anderson created the Journey to Achieve Foundation to help Black people across California and Mexico. He was also a part of the Warriors' Voters Win campaign during the 2020 election."
"How dare you disrespect Juan ""Steph's teammate"" Toscano Anderson, and Jordan ""booty shorts"" Poole."
"&gt;His second option was Andrew Wiggins and his third was Juan Toscano-Anderson.  Toscano-Anderson was 11th on the team in FGA, 13th in FGA per game and 7th/6th in minutes/mpg. He wasn't remotely close to being the 3rd option. That was pretty easily Oubre or Wiseman, for whatever that's worth."
"To me they sit respectively at 3rd and 2nd, right below Juan Toscano Anderson"
Well no but maybe CP3 could've seen more chemistry with Harden. Harden shoots 10 threes a game yet when CP3 had the ball he's walking around at the logo. Why couldn't CP3 hold the ball and pass to Harden? He's a great passer.   The guy we're talking about is Draymond. If Harden gave the ball up and did anything off ball then yeah Draymond's an all star. If Harden doesn't and asks Draymond to spot up than wow Draymond can't shoot? What a flaw!    They made Juan Toscano Anderson look like a good passer and all he did was point and pass because he was able to hold the ball as Draymond's backup.
"Tbf y'all got Juan Toscano-Anderson from nowhere, which is a comparably good find"

"Just a little bit better players than Juan Toscano Anderson, Jordan Poole or  Kelly Oubre would be enough. Plus they'll have Klay back next year."
"Yes absolutely. GS had the best player but could only go 8 deep and 1 of those played only 6 minutes in Mulder. Memphis has one of the deepest rosters in the league. While GS had to rely on Juan Toscano Anderson, Kevon Looney, and Kent Bazemore in crunch time"
"Maybe we should have been more concerned when they just barely squeaked past the Big 3 of Steph Curry, Kent Bazemore, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
"I checked this sub to see how the game was going, the only thing on the front page was a Juan Toscano-Anderson highlight from the Warriors being down 14. That was the only highlight on the front page and the game was in the third quarter"

Juan Toscano Anderson
"Kyle Anderson and Juan Toscano Anderson fight for the ball and it goes out of bounds.  ""Looks like it went off of Anderson.""  Grade A commentary."
Bol  Bol  Juan  Toscano  Anderson
"1st, If you don’t think AD’s statement was nephew-as-fuck, I’m not really sure what to tell you.   2nd the Lakers won because AD sacked up and played the five.  3rd. AD makes it seem like if the NBA’s rags to riches success story Juan Toscano-Anderson hadn’t talked shit to Lebron the Lakers, who should have just killed the Warriors in the first place, would have lost, which is disingenuous."
"&gt; Juan Toscano-Anderson bumped LeBron James on the shoulder and told him something  ""Thursday is the optimal day to consume tacos."""
"&gt; As the both teams were headed to their benches, Juan Toscano-Anderson bumped LeBron James on the shoulder and told him something. A few minutes before that, he went right at James in transition and scored.  &gt; In Toscano-Anderson’s mind, there was clearly something brewing between him and James in the first half, but James didn’t seem to be aware of it until he said something. Following that interaction, James was clearly more energized, and that energy became infectious for his teammates in the second half of their comeback win.   Do people really believe the narrative that LeBron is mentally weak so you should talk shit to him? Do people realize that when this guy is on a mission, he becomes a freight train?"
You also have Kelly Oubre who isn't shooting horridly because he's injured and the addition of Juan Toscano Anderson which helps their spacing.
Juan Toscano-Anderson happened. He took all those minutes.
....and Juan Toscano Anderson and Jordan Poole. Big yikes.
"Again, it really sucks you have to try to feel better about watching your team struggle against Juan Toscano Anderson and Jordan Poole. Yikes."
"The league sent in the hit squad and the Lakers BARELY beat them.  When you're struggling against Juan Toscano Anderson and Jordan Poole....yikes.  Lakers fans should be embarrassed. The Lakers really, truly almost lost to a joke team except for an all time ref job."
Bruh Curry had Juan Toscano-Anderson and he couldnt get the win lmao
"Shutting down Juan Toscano Anderson, mulver and Draymond ain't scary."
"Steph curry, Stephen curry, wardell curry 2, skyfucker and Juan toscano Anderson"

"""wHoS gOnNa GuARd aD aNd LebRoN???""  Juan Toscano Anderson, Wiggins, and Draymond. And they gonna shut them down"
I can't believe they allowed Curry to play on the same team as the GOAT Juan Toscano-Anderson - this shit's just not fair.
Juan Toscano-Anderson is a young FUCKING HERO from Oakland
Imagine the GOAT MJ at any point in his life getting locked up by Juan Toscano Anderson lmfao
LeBron getting locked up by Juan Toscano-Anderson. What fucking dimension are we living in
I LOVE JUAN TOSCANO-ANDERSON SO FUCKING MUCH
Yall laughing but I just saw klay do the fusion dance with Juan Toscano Anderson
"The Lakers found an offense that was working, and they kept doing it until Toronto proved they could stop it. That's like strategy 101.   So if Curry starts off 10/10 on 3s tomorrow night, you'll be arguing that GS should stop passing to him so that Juan Toscano-Anderson can shoot more? Like some weird kind of basketball communism where no one gets 11 shots until everyone gets 10."
Counter counter counter point: Juan Toscano Anderson.
"Draymond is gonna be All-Defense for the sixth time this season, so he's still one of the best defenders in the league.  The Warriors have a top five (or so) defense while playing a top five pace and I'm confident that D rating isn't thanks to Curry or Bazemore or Juan Toscano-Anderson or..."
paschall won’t see minutes (unless our offense is stagnating with the second unit)  Juan Toscano Anderson also gets a ton of wide open looks a game but only takes a few of them
Ah yes people like Kevon Looney and Juan Toscano-Anderson  so hateable

Please let me know if you have any comments or criticism.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPh9UEiFXs"
"Steph, Dame, Juan Toscano-Anderson superteam smh parity is dead"
"Doug would be an awesome return for Dame but tbh I think we can get a better package, something like Andrew Wiggins and Juan Toscano-Anderson could be in the mix but idk maybe I'm just a homer."
"Juan Toscano-Anderson, Jordan Poole and Niccolo Mannion. Cmon guys, did you even watch this season? Smh"
"This is a pretty good move by the Celtics, but it sucks to see him leave.  For those who don't know, Aaron Miles was the HC of the Santa Cruz Warriors from 2017-2019 and Player Development Coach from 2019-21. His Santa Cruz team consisted of Chris Boucher, Kendrick Nunn, Georges Niang, Damion Lee, and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This season, he was mainly credited with the improvement of Juan Toscano-Anderson and Andrew Wiggins"
"We embraced the shit outta Juan Toscano-Anderson because he's from the Town, we already love Dame because he's literally one of us"
juan toscano-anderson is mexican american i think
Maybe add Juan Toscano Anderson too  Or how about   Siakam and Anunoby for   Wiggins Oubre Wiseman 7 14 and a future first
below Juan Toscano-Anderson
"Mikal ""Juan "" Steph curry's teamamate"" Toscano-Anderson"" Bridges"
"THT is basically untradeable, same with Kuzma and Caruso. These guys are all stars in the making, reminds me of Playoff Looney and Juan Toscano Anderson. Basically mediocre role players get that big market sheen and all of a sudden become 'assets'"
Juan Toscano-Anderson  -each teams sixth or seventh player.
"Yeah, he's one of those players you gotta see play to recognize their worth (i.e. Juan Toscano Anderson). Their stats aren't impressive. But they buy in 100% into their team. Caruso didn't go to his sister's wedding during the bubble playoffs. That right there shows how committed he is."
Juan Toscano-Anderson shoulda gotten this award
"It took me a good 30 seconds to realize you meant Juan Toscano-Anderson and not Juntao, the feared Triad boss from Rush Hour."
"This Warriors ownership and front office *really* want to be the next Spurs.   That means developing the next batch of talent while you still got your current but aging core.   I know Wiseman wasn't great his rookie year but he showed lots of potential, Poole is looking like he's a year away from winning a 6MOY award, and the Warriors have two cracks at lotto picks in this draft.   They've developed some bench talent, guys like Poole of course, but Damion Lee gave good bench minutes, Bazemore (who will almost certainly be back) gave good minutes off the bench despite some of his frustrating fouling/turn over tendencies, Mulder's not great but he's another shooter, can defend a little better than first thought, and has continuity with the team.   Juan Tuscano Anderson has been a great find, very hard nosed, tough, plays good defense and has out of nowhere this season decided he can hit open 3's.   I hope they can bring back Oubre, Jessup will get a chance to prove he deserves a roster spot during summer league, but a couple other guys should be off the roster.   When I look at the roster the Warriors might be fielding next season:  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Andrew Wiggins  Draymond Green  Kevon Looney  Jordan Poole  Kelly Oubre (maybe)  Juan Toscano-Anderson  Damion Lee  Michael Mulder   a couple lottery picks  1 or 2 ring chasing veterans  I feel like that's a roster that can compete for a title with any team I've watched play in this year's playoffs."
"How come Portland keeps missing on the players that fills the gap like: Terrence Mann, Bruce Brown, Juan Toscano Anderson, Jaesean Tate.. they’re out there!"
"juan toscano-anderson (gsw) is supposedly the only current player of mexican descent in the league (unless something changed since last fall), and there were only 4 others before him.  EDIT: brook lopez's father was cuban"
"Reportedly the Kerr/Juan Toscano-Anderson relationship has been ""tense"""
"The Warriors have a history of small ball and ball-movement-based offenses, going back to the small ball of the we believe team and the run and gun style of Run TMC. The modern dynasty run and the 07 We Believe run were also underrated in terms of scrappy defense. I think you can construct just such a lineup using only historic Warriors players:   PG: Stephen Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Chris Mullin PF: Stephen Jackson C: Draymond Green  6th man: Juan Toscano-Anderson to rep Oakland.  While Kevin Durant was a truly great player for GSW, he was never quite the cultural fit that this prompt suggests."
"I'm sure the casuals are doing that. Sophisticated fans that appreciate the lesser-recognized stars of the game tune in for Kevon Looney and Juan Toscano-Anderson,"
Or Juan Toscano Anderson
Juan Toscano Anderson
Same thing with us and Juan Toscano Anderson
"Juan Toscano-Anderson. Ever since that score board tumble incident, he’ll get the ball at any cost."
Bro how does everyone in the league have this move in the bag 💀even Juan Toscano Anderson did the throw-ahead snatchback the other day too.   I need to see Mark Gasol doing this
Stanley Johnson is a dangerously impoverished man's OG Anunoby  Yuta Watanabe is Juan Toscano-Anderson but converted to yen
"Not sure I think this dude can be a real superstar, but Juan Toscano Anderson gives me Draymond Green vibes"
"Going to disagree.  People really underestimate what Curry was doing with the squad he had. Warriors had basically no depth. Took the Lakers with both AD and Lebron in with Kevin Looney and Kent Bazemore in the starting lineup and Wiggins as his 2nd option to a 3pt game in the play ins.  Had Poole, Mychal Mulder, and Juan Toscano-Anderson on rotation. That was it."
"It's so crazy, we're really lucky. A playoff core of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney, Iguodala/Porter/Bjelica plus an entire young core of Poole/Moody/Kuminga/Toscano-Anderson/Wiseman (I know Juan is older but he's only a sophomore in the league) is amazing. We basically have our future picks, too.   Only issue is if the young guys end up needing fat extensions while the old guys are on bloated contracts. A billion dollar luxury tax bill is a no go lol."
"Warriors have done a pretty good job with Danuel House, Kendrick Nunn, Jordan Poole, Juan Toscano-Anderson and those are just in the last 3-4 years"
I see your 53% from 3 on 12.5 attempts and raise you 50.3% on 14.3 attempts while playing with Juan Toscano Anderson and Kent Bazemore.
"For Oakland,  PG- Damian Lillard  SG- Gary Payton   SF- Paul Pierce  PF- Cliff Trent Robinson  C- Antonio Davis  Bench: Jason Kidd, Drew Gooden, Jim Pollard, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Isiah Rider, Brian Shaw"
"Wiggins homecoming? Raptors get Wiggs and Paschall.

"Draymond, Gil, CJ, and Juan Toscano-Anderson as Ernie 2.0. 🔥🔥"
"I disagree completely. We started the year with Klay and Chris’s out for the year. We than have no summer league and training camp for the youngest roster in the league. Than we lose wiseman , oubre, lee and pascal do the injury. And win out 70% of our final 20 games when Steph Dray and Wigs was healthy and we made the play in with 8 healthy guys 3 of them g leaguers   Did we lose ? Yeah so what.  We got the 14th pick in hindsight   Also Juan Toscano Anderson and Poole took a jump last year ( Poole is gonna impress people he added on some muscle)   We start the season with Curry Wiggins Porter Draymond Looney   Until Klay comes back than Porter Jr goes to bench  (Porter JR 40% from 3 and great D for the min)  With a bench of Poole (FA MLE) Moody JTA Wiseman Bjeleica Kuminga   The West hasn’t really improved   (Denver Clippers injured)   Jazz and Suns Relatively the same   And the Lakers got some guys lost some guys   We got better. Steph resigned for 4 years and we are back to contending.   Yeah we aren’t THE Favorites   But stop crying and smell the roses the warriors are back bro. You hella negative lol"
So the Warriors now have 3 MVPs on their team.   (Juan Toscano-Anderson was the 2018 LNBP MVP.)
You mean Bay legend Juan Toscano-Anderson right?
Andrew Wiggins is the only legit veteran wing we have. Juan Toscano Anderson can't play starter minutes. Kuminga and Moody are unproven and likely the assets given up in a trade.
Let's not forget about the Warriors with Stephen Curry and Juan Toscano-Anderson (the 2018 Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional MVP).
&gt;mexican standoff  *Juan Toscano-Anderson has entered the chat*.
"Sure!  1. Adrian Dantley 2. Alex English 3. Wilkins 4. Kidd 5. Melo 6. Pau Gasol 7. Tony Parker 8. Chris Mullin 9. Mitch Redmond 10. Webber 11. Penny Hardaway 12. Brandon Roy 13. David West 14.

Ramon Sessions 26. Juan Toscano-Anderson 27. Nerlens Noel 28. Maxi Kleber 29. Eric Bledsoe 30. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  These thirty are all convincingly ahead of him too imo, so that eliminates him from being top sixty."
Juan Toscano-Anderson aka JTA!
Juan Toscano Anderson
"the thing about this, is that the Warriors depth is sooo awful I'd probably rather get depth by trading those picks instead of a 3rd all-star. like if they did that, here is their roster:  * PG: Steph * SG: Beal * SF: Klay * PF: Dray * C: Looney? * 6/7/8: Juan Toscano-Anderson? Eric Paschall? I guess Bertans from your trade?  Like, 1 thru 4 is solid, obvi, but the depth is so bad I'm not sure you're really a contender. I'd rather stick with a Curry/Klay/Dray core, roll the dice on Wiseman year 2, and bring in two rock solid starters. I still think Steph can lead you to a chip on his own with the right team around him"
"I have a little hunch that the Warriors are about to go all in on a 3rd player (Beal or Siakam), when really they'd be better off trading their pieces for \~2 really good floor spacing/defending starters  Curry is still a super duper star, Dray can still defend and be a secondary offensive initiator, and Klay might be more limited but he's never not gonna shoot 40% on 7 attempts per game. they need roster depth more than an extra shot creator, that roster around them is horrible (more Oubre? Juan Toscano-Anderson? Bazemore?). like, after wiggins, who isn't good but is at least an NBA player, it's really bleak"
"Players and teams gotta come together for the good of the league. this simmons shit is madness, nobody wants it. The things that get fans watching are 1- dynasties and 2- homegrown teams. The player movement we see today means you get successive 1-3 year superteams, like the PG thunder, the PG clippers, the Kyrie Celtics, the Kawhi raptors, the Lebron lakers, etc. Means if you do get a nucleus like the old Celtics, Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, Lakers, Warriors, it's harder and harder to keep that dynasty going because fuck it, Giannis decides he'd much rather be mediocre in Miami (for three years, then off to the lakers) than a league icon in Milwaukee. I'd bet you a million dollars that if these stars stayed in their original markets league viewership would be higher than it is now. People want to see the players they cheered for on draft night. I care wayyyy more about Juan Toscano Anderson than I ever did D'Angelo Russell, probably more than Wiggins and maybe even KD. The NBA Carousel soap opera is giving us cheap highs but that's starting to get stale. When every offseason is LEAGUE ALTERING nothing is. Give the players more money, give rookies more money, raise vet minimums whatever, Joe Jumpshot is gonna have to keep playing in Saskatchewan if they keep paying him 10s of millions of dollars, maybe he'll develop a liking to the poutine."
"I love how you can casually watch a game a say ""wow cool dunk Lebron"" or watch it closely and be ""waw that was a great X out rotation by Juan Toscano Anderson"".  I like how different some of the top stars are, I like how polarizing some of those guys are (well besides for Westbrook it goes too far with hiim lol). I love how the games feels like it's constantly evolving.   I love that the NBA stars are mostly likeable, so that I can actually enjoy games despite my team being ass for the past decade"
Never seen a Juan Toscano Anderson hater
Juan Toscano-Anderson! Oh wait that's next year.
Juan Toscano anderson
Juan Toscano Anderson
"I expect to see his minutes drop this season because the roster is a bit deeper than it was last year, but Juan Toscano-Anderson. Not only is he a great story, but he plays really smart, self-aware, basketball."
I say Juan Toscano Anderson. He isn't as offensively explosive as Poole but he played his way into a full rotation from nothing and he's one of the few bench guys who's good at finding a relocating Steph.
"PG: Steph Curry, SG: Jordan Poole, SF: Andrew Wiggins, PF: Draymond Green, C: Kevon Looney. Next 5: Moses Moody, Juan Toscano-Anderson, James Wiseman, Gary Payton II, Otto Porter Jr."
"Philly gets: Peyton Pritchard, Juan Toscano Anderson, AL Horford(money saving purposes next season) 1 first from Boston, 1 first from Golden State  Boston gets: Draymon Green, Shake Milton,  Jordan Poole  Golden state gets: Ben Simmons"
Juan Toscano Anderson
&gt;Who’s your bet on the next guy to get a 5 x 5?  Juan Toscano Anderson almost had one this year lol
"Anthony edwards, and just for fun, Juan Toscano Anderson."
Juan Toscano-Anderson
Juan Toscano-Anderson
"Juan ""Draymond Green"" Toscano-Anderson"
Inb4 Klays gets 3rd place in MVP voting behind Juan Toscano Anderson and Jordan Poole.
"Our second unit is going to be lit. A core of Iguodala, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Otto Porter, and Bjelica, plus either Poole or Klay. Plus one or more of Moody, Wiseman, and Kuminga, if they earn the minutes."
"For sure, the front office is just frustratingly hesitant to pull off a risky trade. If Dame does leave I don't see how your GM keeps his job.  Yeah it's just a terrible matchup for you guys. Historically we've had the guards and wings(klay and Iggy specifically) to slow down dame but Steph has never felt that same pressure from the blazers defenders, and draymond served as the general anchor on both ends that proved to be a specific issue where he could tear you apart himself. He shut down any fast break opportunities and took advantage of the blazers weak defense for easy, but precise passes to cutters to the rim. I think if you guys had Iggy, for example, those series would be a lot closer.  I think our depth is surprisingly good this year. One of our best contributors, Juan Toscano Anderson, who made so many winning plays for us last season, is buried in the rotation barely getting minutes right now. It's crazy to see. We've got a ton of injury concerns but at least in the regular season the depth might be able to help with injuries. If Klay comes back and is still the shooter he was, my homer goggles are tricking me into believing in a conference finals run haha"
"Dude was out there dragging them to the play-in with Bazemore, Looney, Juan Toscano Anderson, Mulder and Damion Lee playing meaningful minutes.  Half the season he had Brad Wanamaker as his point guard.   They had 8 healthy guys against Memphis, and most of those I just listed."
"Players averaging exactly 9.7 assists per 100 possessions this preseason: Scottie Barnes, Dean Wade, Shake Milton, and Juan Toscano-Anderson."
Tht is like if Juan Toscano Anderson was white and overrated

"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
"It’s crazy, I was in Bay Area HIghschools &amp; met this dude a few time way back due to my dad being a AAU coach &amp; traveling. I just knew him as Juan though or Juan Anderson. I don’t remember the “Toscano” back then so I had no clue it was the same guy. Whenever I heard the name here I thought it was some random undrafted rookie up until a month ago lol I definitely appreciate his grind"
How is Juan Toscano-Anderson not the most beloved player in the NBA? Dude seems like a nice guy who shows up and works his ass off. Hopefully he can get more recognition by the NBA fanbase because this guy is great.
My boi Juan Toscano-Anderson with the 0/5/5/2 statline; +15 BPM
"&gt;	“all the previous years their defense without him was way worse [than] last season”  This line kind of negates your argument about the defense *just* being good because the other teams stars were on the bench, since that should happen every year.   My personal theory is that last years defense was comparatively better on defense because players knew they had to put a ton of effort into defense, since they didn’t have the top end offensive talent to compete. Fringe NBA players that can’t score a ton, like Juan Toscano-Anderson, don’t have privilege of sandbagging on defense, like Carmelo Anthony.   **Personal Anecdote:** It’s like when I play pick up games at the Y. I usually play in pickup games in the “middle” Court, where all the not great, but not terrible people play, and on that court I get to do dribble moves, create my own shot, and play some PG. In those games, I don’t can’t try my hardest at defense, cause then I’ll be too tired to run the offense. However, occasionally when the Y is a little empty, I’ll get called on to play on the “good” court, and in those games I’m not as good at creating my own shot as other guys on my team. As a result, I basically just convert into a 3 and D player, and focus almost all my energy into being a pest on defense."
Juan Toscano-Anderson is just biding his time to hold Myers over a barrel.
*Juan Toscano-Anderson has entered the game.*
I was more impressed with Juan Toscano Anderson best triple single this game 9/9/9
Do you ever have it where you get a random name stuck in your head?  For whatever reason for me it's Juan Toscano Anderson
So? What do their contracts have to do with the best player conversation? Juan Toscano Anderson makes $1.7 million dollars for his production. Ja Morant is not 5 times better than him
"Trust warriors fans when we say we feel for Jokic. Last year Steph was playing like an MVP too, but we were so injured that we didn't even have a center to play. We had no choice but to have Juan Toscano Anderson play as our 5."
"&gt;These are things that any player can do, whether they're Steph Curry or Juan Toscano-Anderson  You're supposed to use a bad player to contrast an all time great player like JTA"
"Well they've had their fair share of duds in the last few years, but that's bound to happen when you're a team that consistently drafts in the late first round.  The cool thing about how the Warriors play basketball is that it gives every prospect a chance to earn their minutes by doing the little things that Coach Kerr values. Do you defend hard and rotate on time? Do you communicate to your teammates on defense? Do you set screens and give up your chance to score if it means a teammate can get an easy bucket? Do you cut hard and make contact even if you might not get the ball?  These are things that any player can do, whether they're Steph Curry or Juan Toscano-Anderson"
"Warriors already have Juan Toscano Anderson who is basically a poor man's Draymond Green clone. They don't need a max slot dedicated to another backup for Draymond Green. If they are gonna dump Wiggins and Wiseman they need an *upgrade* at the 3, which at the bare minimum would be a Harrison Barnes level player. Not Simmons who won't shoot and just stands at the dunker spot in the playoffs."
Ok from now on I will say Juan Toscano-Anderson are you happy?
Juan toscano Anderson
"The Warriors like to collect former MVPs:  * Kevin Durant, 2014 NBA MVP * JaVale McGee, 2012 &amp; 2013 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Juan Toscano-Anderson, 2018 LNBP MVP * Otto Porter Jr., 2015 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Nemanja Bjelica, 2015 EuroLeague MVP"

"Kerr has the easiest job in the world, just sits back and lets superstars like Juan Toscano-Anderson do his job for him"
"&gt;warriors haven't been a great defense without curry-klay-dray-(iggy/bogut/durant),   As I mentioned above, they were the #5 defense in the league *last year* without Klay, Iggy, Bogut, or Durant.   And let's not act like KG's teammates were ""barely in the NBA"" either:    KG managed a below-average defense with Chauncy Billups, Terrell Brandon, Wally Szerbiak, Anthony Peeler, and Laphonso Ellis. Not Ellis and Peeler aren't household names but you're talking about guys who had decade+ long NBA careers. Nor are Troy Hudson, Rasho Neshovic, or Kendall Gill guys who were ""barely in the NBA.""  Or you've got the teams with Latrell Sprewell, Ricky Davis, Sam Cassell, etc.  I just find it hard to fathom how you're claiming he was surrounded by guys who were ""barely in the NBA"" while conveniently forgetting (despite the fact that I talked about it upthread at length) what Draymond did *last year*. Because if you actually want to talk about guys who are ""barely in the NBA"" shouldn't we lead that list with Juan Toscano-Anderson, and Damien Lee, who were two-way contracts as recently as 2021 and 2020, respectively?"
Juan Toscano Anderson  He’s a really excellent glue guy. Kinda like baby Draymond with the passing and positionless style but he’s already late 20s. Definitely a good role player in the nba and should stick around for a while. Underrated athlete

"Cavs: Go up 13 to end the 3rd quarter   Steph: Wait a minute, I'm WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY   &amp;shy;   Also I would like to publicly apologize for doubting Juan Toscano Anderson"
"I would actually argue the opposite.  They actually *were* serviceable next to their stars. Then they went to other teams and weren't even playable.  That speaks volumes to both their ability to get pieces that fit and also get the most out of players.  They managed to turn KD leaving as a UFA into a bunch of assets and then turned those assets into better assets.  There were some players they signed that didn't pan out, but they aren't saddled with any atrocious contracts because of it.  Prior to this season they added Juan Toscano-Anderson and GPII.  They turned Lee from a complete scrub into a valuable bench contributor.  I could go on and on..."
"Underrated hallmark is ability to find minutes for lesser role players and have those guys excel in their role. It’s why teams uncovered gems like Bruce Brown, GP2, Juan Toscano Anderson.. the role players that probably would not shine for other teams in other situation but coaching and that situation just works.   Billy Donovan and his 3 guards line up, from OKC to Chicago gets some credit here along this line too, you just gotta make it work and find minutes for guys. Brad Stevens able to make jt work with Evan Turner and that got ET paid. Miami under Spoelstra got the likes of Dion Waiters, Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow look kinda good. Those guys production just drop off the moment they move on from Miami."
That would guarantee an FMVP trophy to..... Juan-Toscano-Anderson for keeping Giannis to a mere 40/12/6
"Juan Toscano-Anderson is proof of this. He plays a perfect role. They don’t need him to score 50 or even try. They need him to support the stars we have. Be reliable, Make an open shot off a double. Hustle make small plays on D"
"But it's also addition by addition:   They added competent role players in Bjelica, OPJ, GP2, and Iguodala - and then just asked them to do the things they do well.   People underestimate the value of having 4-8th guys who SHOULD BE 4th-8th guys and are being put in the right position to succeed. e.g., last year Juan Toscano-Anderson was 7th in total minutes, which understates his role since he didn't really start playing a lot until the team shifted more into win-now mode and played his largest role in the team's April and May stretch run.   This year, he's 10th in total minutes. It's early, but the point is he's a fringe rotation guy and now they can play him like a fringe rotation guy, instead of playing him like a major-minutes backup."
"juan toscano anderson, when you're here, youre family"
