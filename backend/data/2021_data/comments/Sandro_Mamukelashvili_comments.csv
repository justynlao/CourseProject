Sandro Mamukelashvili
Sandro Mamukelashvili from Georgia probably getting drafted in second round
"Suggs, Barnes, Mann. And Greg Brown,  Isaiah Todd, Herb Jones, Queta, Wieskamp, Sandro Mamukelashvili if they get anything beyond garbage minutes."

"I know it's sooooooooooooo early, but Sandro Mamukelashvili just looks like he has ""it"" to me. Probably just homerism, but the way the dude moves and passes at his size is something I haven't really seen anywhere."
Sandro Mamukelashvili is the next magic Johnson

"Bucks Rookie picked 54 overall Sandro Mamukelashvili had a nice first game. 11 points, 12 Rebounds and 4 sick ass assists. He's 6'11 and will be biggest steal of the draft. Mamu sat out all the third Quarter."
For all we know it could be 57th overall Sandro Mamukelashvili üíÄ way to early to talk about that.
"No it's disrespectful to Jokic and Luka lol. Sandro Mamukelashvili played similar to Sengun, and was a 2nd round pick, you don't see people posting this shit about him."
"Bucks' Big Three; Jordan Nwora, Sandro Mamukelashvili and Mamadi Diakite."
"No bias, but I think Sandro Mamukelashvili wins"

"Need him for the bucks all names line up      Sandro Mamukelashvili      Giannis Antetokounmpo      Thanasis Antetokounmpo      Jesusemilore Ojeleye      Anddddd      Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk  Michael Budenholzer"

"""Giannis Antetokoumpno, Thanasis Antetokoumpno, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Patrick Connaughton, Georgios Kalaitzikis""  Coach: Michael Budenholzer"
"If Sandro Mamukelashvili and Giannis ever unironically plays a minute together, I am deeply sorry for next season bucks fans"
"Sandro Mamukelashvili is the next Jokic, losing a second rounder is a true tragedy for us."
i‚Äôve never heard of Sandro Mamukelashvili but i‚Äôm going to say he‚Äôs gonna be a future star. if that happens i will be the only person with this take and look really good
Quinten Grimes and sandro mamukelashvili
All this to stop Sandro Mamukelashvili. Smh
"Sandro ""Mamu"" Mamukelashvili"
"Everyone is just bored. Portland paid a low first to pick up a useful veteran. Lauri was leaving anyways. Jones Jr will be playing in Turkey next year.   .but hey, a Nuggets 2023 2nd!!!!!!! That could net the Bulls the next Sandro Mamukelashvili"
Future MVP Sandro Mamukelashvili for the Pacers
Sandro Mamukelashvili would like to have a word.
"See I actually watch *and* understand basketball. Might wanna work on that other part.    Their are levels of talent in the NBA beyond just ‚Äústars‚Äù and ‚Äúrole players‚Äù. Mainly ‚Äúend of bench guys‚Äù.   The Lakers don‚Äôt really have many legitimate role players on their roster anymore. They traded most of that talent besides THT when they got Westbrook.   The ‚Äúrole players‚Äù LA has right now are more in the end-of-bench category outside of a couple. You can‚Äôt just put all the blame on them and assume they would step up to fill the hole in depth that Caruso and KCP left. That‚Äôs why Caruso is Caruso and KCP is KCP.    It‚Äôs like the Bucks during their first ten or so games‚Äî were scrubs like Justin Robinson and Sandro Mamukelashvili role players? No, they were high-end G League guys who had to pretend they were better than they actually were. And the Bucks lost a lot of those games as a result. Difference being Milwaukee just had to wait for guys to get healthy‚Äî LA‚Äôs roster just looks fundamentally lost."
"But an all-time great trio of names in Georgios Kalaitzakis, Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Sandro Mamukelashvili."
If Sandro Mamukelashvili was on any non-contending team he would be getting decent minutes. The Wisconsin Herd are undefeated and he's playing great basketball.

Sandro Mamukelashvili sounds like he would be a really good wrestler
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
"*Make sure you guys follow Sandro Mamukelashvili, from Jersia*"
We're actually moving closer to a lineup with:  Pat Connaughton  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Georgios Kalaitzakis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili  And that doesn't even include Donte DiVincenzo. Has anyone seen this lineup play in its entirety? Have they gotten 4 out of 5 of these guys?
"You‚Äôd be surprised how many degenerates seem to feed on the suffering of others on the internet.   Btw, do you think the bucks would trade Sandro Mamukelashvili for Cade Bustingham and 2 firsts? That guy has never missed a three in his career whereas Cade has never made one."
"Kalaitzakis had I think one decent game against the Mavericks, but overall was pretty uninspiring. He plays defense well-enough, rebounds and can make the occasional pass but that's about it.  &gt; if I'm Bud, I'm treating this as an extra preseason game. Trot everyone to court and see if you have a hidden rotation guy buried in the bench.  That's exactly what's been happening the last 5-7 games. Justin Robinson is a two-way PG who was cut by the Thunder last year after 9 games. He's played as many minutes as Sengun. Sandro Mamukelashvili, a 54th pick on a two-way contract drafted to the defending champions has played more minutes than *19* first round picks. Bucks went into the season with an empty roster spot - which worked well last season since it meant they could get Teague and PJ - so the rotation is just so short right now that regardless of what Bud wants to do everyone is getting minutes."
"I'm guessing George Hill/Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora/Thanasis Antetokounmpo/Bobby Portis. Portis is likely still on limited minutes, so yeah Sandro Mamukelashvili may see some bigger minutes."

"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Grayson Allen  George Hill (I think)  Sandro Mamukelashvili  Semi Ojeleye  Scrimblo Bimblo
At one point the Bucks ran a line-up of:  Justin Robinson  Jordan Nwora  Rodney Hood  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili
cade a bust pistons shouldve taken sandro mamukelashvili
I don't know if Justin Robinson and Sandro Mamukelashvili are known for elite defense. I don't think they're known for anything.
Sandro Mamukelashvili looks like Mose Schrute
"No you're right, when it comes to the playoffs I'm real concerned about Sandro Mamukelashvili and Justin Robinson's ability to play 8 minutes in the first quarter."
"Alright Heat commentators, let's see you try and pronounce Sandro Mamukelashvili."
I'm pretty sure I used to buy weed from Sandro Mamukelashvili in NE Philly

Casuals these days don't even know Sandro Mamukelashvili.
"It‚Äôs factually known Memphis was about to have Sandro Mamukelashvili drop 30 on them in the 4th.  Couldn‚Äôt stomach it, and I completely understand. I‚Äôd have done the same."
