Markelle Fultz
Markelle Fultz
"But Jimmy can actually make contested mid-range shots, it's not like he's Ricky Rubio or Markelle Fultz. He's not a *great* shooter, but he's not incapable of scoring, he just picks his spots.   And my point was more in relation to what OP was saying by not getting the Butler hype, which is preposterous to me because the guy has:  - Been the best player on a team that made the Finals  - Made 5 All-Star teams  - Made 3 All-NBA teams  - Made 3 All-Defense teams  How many players in the league have that kind of resume? Bottom line is he's a winning basketball player, and every team he joins wins more when he joins, and loses more when he leaves."
"Markelle Fultz had the best jumpshot coming out of college, coupled with a solid floater and a little playmaking. Its a shame injuries faulted his jumper and tearing his acl recently hasn’t helped his career much either. Hope he gets his touch back"
Markelle Fultz was an obvious one. Hindsight is 20/20  Anthony Bennett is the most questionable one.
&gt; you don't just forget how to shoot  ever heard of markelle fultz?
C'mon dude. As a Celtics fan you benefited from trading away former All-Stars for picks and assets.  - Nets 2016 1st Round Pick used to get Jaylen Brown at 3. - Nets 2017 1st Round Pick used to get Markelle Fultz later traded for #3 Jayson Tatum and some future pick.
"Fuck you to whoever posted this. Steve Clifford has led us to the playoffs two years in a row after missing it for like 7 years and you think we should fire him bc his team without Jonathan Isaac, markelle fultz, mcw, chuma, aminu, + Fournier being out for like 4 games, is losing games. Should the pacers jazz suns and nets also relocate as they’ve never won a championship and all of those teams have been in the league longer than us? What about the clippers nuggets timberwolves hornets grizzlies and pelicans? They’ve never even been to a finals. Come on bruh"
Imagine needing markelle fultz that much.
"The 2 guys I had in mind immediately  stopped playing after 2019, they are 32 and 30 years old respectively and had great talent with some legendary showings. I'm talking about Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson. Both are still NBA calibre players easily imo in terms of skill but their character is just too tough to deal with along with questionable work ethic. Especially Beasley at times looked like the greatest player in the NBA when he decided to go all out and have a good day at the same time.  Currently in the league I'd say Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins. Andrew Wiggins showed many Superstar-level performances at this point of his career but those games are far inbetween. Lonzo imo shows great athleticism, defense and amazing passing ability as well as general BBIQ. When he goes hard on a drive he's showing glimpses of great finishing qualities and his physique is primed to bully small guard on both ends. His mentality holds him back though. Kind of low-hanging fruit to add to this would be Markelle Fultz lol   Some lower tier ones may be Kristaps and Lauri Makkanen, they look like Dirk on good games but injuries or mental troubles kept them away from having a breakout season into All-Star level (Lauri) or Superstardom (Kristaps). I'll also add Gallinari to the mix as he's an ultra skilled guy but always suffered bad injuries when he finally looked like he figured the NBA out. And a guy that was a Superstar but still never quite reached his peak would be Blake Griffin. Injuries once again held him back from having his best season. If some things went different he'd have a good chance to be a top 10 player, Blake could do it all and had great work ethic."
How is markelle fultz your favorite player lmao
"Russel Westbrook is my favorite player. Well, was, before Markelle fultz. ( I guess I have a thing for guards who can’t shoot). I’m not gonna say Westbrook is underrated, because his lack of jumper and his sometimes questionable decision making has cost his teams some games. However, I cannot tolerate Westbrook hate for the simple reason that this guy gives his ALL every single time he steps on the court. He plays with the raw enthusiasm and emotion most of us mimicked on the playgrounds growing up. Russel is a beast of a human and an abnormal athlete. I’ll forever love the way he attacked the rim in his prime and his passion for the game was always overflowing. Don’t hate on a guy who gives his best everyday. He’s got limitations, but effort and heart is not one of them."
Markelle Fultz isn't comparable to the gum on Brandon Roy's shoe.
"Of course not, Markelle Fultz forgot how to play basketball before he played an NBA game.  I was trying to get at the hype of the duo being similar, but it was a lazy analogy, just the first and only one I could think of since there's only so many Oden comparisons."
Nephews don't remember the Blazers losing a Markelle Fultz and Joel Embiid-esque duo to career ending injuries.
Markelle Fultz
"That’s only because he’s so scared to shoot, that any 3 point attempt by him is such an infrequent occurrence that it automatically becomes a sideshow attraction and people are gonna meme it to death, whether he makes it or misses...  If he was missing 2 or 3 shots every night, they would no longer be as noteworthy and people would stop making it such a thing  We did the exact same shit to Markelle Fultz, and look what happened... he started actually shooting more and we stopped caring about every time he had an ugly miss... when’s the last time we’ve seen a Fultz shooting lowlight on the front page?"

Markelle Fultz not being able to shoot
"Three of these players are starters: Markelle Fultz, Evan Fournier, and Jonathan Isaac.  Three of these players are out indefinitely or until next season: Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac, and Al-Farouq Aminu.  Just depressing to watch."
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barbershop. Markelle Fultz can’t shoot 3s, Markelle Fultz fucked his free throw. My boy weak, he got the yips or something. He, he say that boy ain’t been putting in work. SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y’all don’t know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about Fultz ain’t no hitter, Fultz a bust, Fultz a fake SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y’all don’t live with that boy! You know that boy got shout-out from KD, shooting hesi pull ups and shit. Kelle been pullin up since fucking.... I don’t know when. Motherfuckers stop fucking playin him like that. Them boys ballin out here. If I catch another Tatum or Big Baller Ass motherfucker talking sweet about ‘Kelle I’m fuckin beating they ass! I’m not fucking playing no more, you know those boys roll with Ben Simmons and them!"
"What do you mean ""now"" im talking about trading down? Read our comments again, im talking about it from the start. You either draft for fit or trade down if you can already contend has always been my point, and Warriors were not in a position to trade down for Wiseman.  Also, you are being extreme with your examples. Im talking about very specific situations here and im not being unreasonable. I can come up with extreme scenarios where your way of thinking would look dumb as well. Imagine screwing up the balance and chemistry on a championship roster just to draft Markelle Fultz? Extreme hypotheticals like this is irrelevant."
Markelle Fultz to James Harden
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
Jonathan Simmons. He's the superstar that was traded for #1 pick Markelle Fultz
"NBA players are most overpaid athletes on earth. Markelle Fultz has made 70 million guaranteed dollars so far and he sat out half the time and has proven nothing. Dude was immature and babied / given endless time to develop by 76ers and still got another 50 million off some mythical potential that will lead to nothing. Basketball is fun, no head trauma and they’d do it for free half of em. Guys are so overpaid it’s laughable. And people look up to these guys for playing basketball. Kyrie went to 1 class at Duke and he thinks he’s some smart guy. Not saying that determines everything but Kyrie is laughable. Imagine any other job getting 30 million to have fun and not show up cause some BS social reasons when you living best life possible. Kyrie been a joke since day 1"
"Here's one I haven't seen, Markelle Fultz.   He was the clear choice for #1 overall heading into the draft, then he got this mystery shoulder injury before the season started and his shooting form went to trash, then he had a couple injury filled seasons in Philly, then traded to Orlando where he was expected to take some time to get back into form, only to year his ACL at the beginning of this season. The amount of hindsight bias when people clown the Sixers for taking him over Tatum is just disrespectful."
Markelle Fultz playing like a former lottery pick
"Which will air as part of a two part series, the second part being the ""why Markelle Fultz STOPPED being able to fucking shoot"" episode"
Markelle Fultz? You mean MF?
"Whos Fultz? Markelle, Jonathon"
"Look, if you wanna say he’s not a bust, that’s fine. But don’t use the fact that he broke a record previously held by *Markelle Fultz* as evidence."
The most amazing part of this post to me is the fact that Markelle Fultz scored 10+ points in a game at one point in his career.
"Label him a bust... sure, were is Markelle Fultz nowadays? Either way it's premature man, we can't label him a bust neither a superstar. Also, Lonzo Ball had a similar record as well... were is he now? WestBrook's first triple double happened when he was 21 years old... there's so many examples that can point at busts or stars, we just have to wait and see"
"Am I the only one that read this and thought ""Oh shit, I completely forgot about Markelle Fultz""?"
"If Markelle Fultz is not injured, he would've taken back that record. #BenjaminButtonBasketball"
"Markelle Fultz. Before him, Lonzo held the record for a couple of months."
Markelle Fultz...
Agreed. Maybe markelle fultz money?
“Nice form!” - Markelle Fultz
Markelle Fultz was such a revolutionary in his departure from the Sixers it was almost Magic.

Using a 40 attempt qualifier:  Caris LeVert 138 from 145  Aron Baynes 37 from 45  Aaron Holiday 46 from 51  Cedi Osman 106 from 105  **Killian Hayes 32 from 47**  Markelle Fultz 103 from 104  Cole Anthony 69 from 76  Michael Carter-Williams 36 from 44  Devonte Graham 80 from 99  Ish Smith 42 from 46  Gary Harris 56 from 61  Kelly Oubre 84 from 101  JJ Redick 49 from 55  Dillon Brooks 129 from 132  Tyus Jones 59 from 63  So Killian Hayes at 0.68ppa is the least efficient shooter in the league so far this season
Dillon Brooks (129 on 132 shots)   Markelle Fultz (103 on 104 shots)   Kelly Oubre Jr. (84 on 101 shots)   Devonte Graham (80 on 99 shots)   Cole Anthony (69 on 76 shots)   Tyus Jones (59 on 63 shots)   Aaron Holiday (46 on 51 shots)   Killian Hayes (32 on 47 shots)   Aaron Baynes (37 on 45 shots)   Michael Carter- Williams (36 on 44 shots)   Derrick Jones Jr. (42 on 44 shots)   Sekou Dombouya (38 on 39 shots)   James Johnson (33 on 34 shots)   Kendrick Nunn (26 on 29 shots)   Jevon Carter (22 on 26 shots)
Im actuallykind of happy that Markelle Fultz got injured. Obviously I don’t want people tearing their ACLs but now cole Anthony will get a starting spot. I think he’s really good he’s my second favorite rookie behind haliburton
This sucks! I hope Markelle Fultz recovers soon! I hate injuries to any NBA players even if they don't play for my team.
 wonder how this thread will look when Knicks opponents aren't shooting 28% from 3 despite allowing teams to shoot them at the third highest frequency in the NBA? Is this gonna be like the markelle fultz thread where everyone falls in love with a ridculously small sample size and circle jerks over it only to look stupid days later?
"Has Edwards impressed though? 14 ppg on really poor shooting for a terrible team, not contributing anywhere else on the court, has the same bad habits as he did in college.  I'm not writing him off of course, but I'm certainly not ""impressed"" either compared to other #1 picks. Look at the early games of the past ten #1 picks -- obviously Edwards has been better than the early games of Anthony Bennett and Markelle Fultz, but that's it. Every other pick (including Wiggins) started off significantly better. Time will tell but as of now I don't feel like I'm watching a star in the making."

"How about before creating an opinion on a player and posting about it, you watch the games he plays in, and then point out his flaws. It's different if you say something like ""Markelle Fultz never seems to get anything done with the ball in his hands like he was in the first couple games of the season, he can't create against good defenses."" rather than ""Fultz got 9 pts and 2 turnovers shooting 30% with a +/- of -31. That means he's trash."" lol"
"if you watch basketball you don't need ""additional context"" to understand why +/- stats are misleading  the only thing Markelle Fultz having a -31 tells me is the Magic probably lost by a lot (they did), and all the starters probably had a double-digit negative +/- (they did).  LeBron has had a +/- of 0 and -1 in games this year. Last year's MVP had -18, -16, -11. It's a dumb stat and people who use it almost never actually watched the game in question"

"This is exactly right. Drafts aren’t perfect, but to the top 5-ish picks are expected to be starters and capable of averaging 15-20 ppg. That’s Wiggins. Markelle Fultz is getting there. Jahlil Okafor probably won’t. If Wiggins was a true bust, he’d be out of the league."

"&gt; How do you differentiate that situation from bad organizations where a player just happened to develop?  Why is it that, year after year, the worst teams get the best draft picks, and, year after year, the worst teams draft mostly busts with those best draft picks?    At some point, it has to be recognized that routing the disproportionately best young talent to the disproportionately worst run teams is one of the dumbest plans ever conceived by anyone.  2 years into a young player's career, at age 21, they've done nothing but lose, and the coach and GM that drafted them get fired, and suddenly, a new regime comes in and drafts their own young player at the same position, and terrible management has sacked a young player's career a full 4 years before that player hits his athletic prime years.  They're done before they even begin.    Yes, the players absolutely do bear a ton of responsibility for draft picks busting.  Sometimes, you draft Dwayne Haskins.  Sometimes, the warriors draft Damion Jones (great physical specimen, good person, but has the BBIQ of a rattle), or you draft Jacob Evans (3-and-D wing with a great college resume, showed up to camp and the warriors found out he was Markelle Fultz, he had a broken jump shot).    However, sometimes, the phoenix suns draft Marquesse Chriss, who has been good for the warriors, and it turns out, just never developed properly with the Suns, and their management at the time.  Kawhi absolutely gets credit for how great a player he's become, but Kawhi could not have found success just anywhere.  The Spurs deserve at ton of credit for his development too."

"I don't think that's the public perception of young players. We're mostly just excited to see them play the first few years and watch them develop skills to see if they measure up to the expectations.   Think about what happened with players like markelle fultz and Andrew wiggins. They came in with high expectations and for all manner of reasons they just never really lived up to the hype. With the exception of some disappointed hometown fans, people weren't really trashing those dudes for being underwhelming. Most people just accepted that they weren't what we thought.   To the original point though... Wiseman is in a unique situation since he plays for a team with a roster that when healthy is a serious contender. Nobody is expecting him to go out there and be shaq. Most Warriors fans are just stoked to have snatched him up and have something entertaining to watch before the real squad gets healthy again."
Markelle fultz still has the talent to be an allstar caliber player
if you think I knew who markelle fultz or anthony edwards were before the draft you're wrong my guy
They got markelle fultz playing the kid??!!
The team that was promised. Markelle Fultz if he didnt loose his jumper would have been a beast.
“Where does Markelle Fultz rank among the best shooters?”
Markelle Fultz after the shoulder injury.
"Paul George   “According to ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman, the Celtics' draft-night offer included three first-round picks and two starting players, one of whom was Jae Crowder. However, the Celtics reportedly refused to include their 2018 first-round pick from the Brooklyn Nets or the Sacramento Kings/Los Angeles Lakers pick that will land in Boston through the Markelle Fultz trade.”"
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills the way people talk about him. I know he's only 19 but if you're the #1 pick in the draft then you get the criticism that comes along with that pick. He has been genuinely terrible so far.  Who are the #1 picks recently that have been worse than Edwards through half of their rookie season? The only ones in the past 20 years worse have been Markelle Fultz, Anthony Bennett, Andrea Bargnani, and Kwame Brown. Wiggins and Bogut are debatable but Edwards's advanced stats are garbage compared to them.  I saw a comment thread recently about Edwards vs. Haliburton and most people were saying they would still take Edwards over Haliburton headed forward. That is absolute nonsense. Haliburton is only 1 year older and making an actual impact every minute he's on the court. It would be foolish to take Edwards over Haliburton in a redraft.  I'm not writing him off completely, obviously it's still way too early for that, but it's fair to look at his poor performance so far and adjust expectations. All the criticisms about his game from college are all 100% spot on so far and that's a major cause for concern."
Markelle Fultz took himself out for most of an entire season after being the #1 pick. Upon his return he decided to chase a loose ball and then break Embiid’s face with his head.
"Conveniently cutting off at 2019.   If you go to years prior you could see he got Smart, Rozier, Brown, Tatum, and Rob Williams In consecutive years.   Also Nesmith, Pritchard and Langford have all played less than 40 games. Those guys make up half of the 6 picks you mentioned and you’re acting as if they’re already wastes.   And they traded 2 of the other picks (Thybulle, Bane) so Ainge didn’t actually make those selections. They were made for the purposes of the trades (clearing cap for Kemba first, and opening a 5.2 million dollar trade exception 2nd).   Last point I’ll make is any other GM in 2016 and 2017 ends up with Kris Dunn and Markelle Fultz. Ainge drafted two all stars in Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and ended up with a future pick he used on Langford who, again, the jury is still out on."
"I think I heard this on a podcast but a 3 point contest with bad and/or weird shooters. Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Lonzo/LaMelo, anyone else?"
"&gt; Ainge is terrible at player evaluation unless there's some kind of consensus like drafting in the top 3 &gt;  &gt;   In Danny's defense, the Celtics had the #1 and could have taken Markelle Fultz if they wanted to go consensus. That dude is pretty cheeks and they fleeced the 76ers into trading up and ended up with the better player."
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
"I mean, he has the 19th lowest PER in his draft class. And I can’t think of #1 overall picks that were this inefficient and aren’t busts. Even Markelle Fultz shot 40% his rookie year and he was considered broken. I’m sure he will get some things figured out, but he even said he doesn’t love basketball before the nba draft happened which makes it hard to believe he’s going to get much better. Hopefully I’m wrong.."
Sixers would have probably the worst perimeter defense of all time.  It’s already bad with Seth Curry and cement shoes Danny Green with Simmons holding the ship together with duck tape and glue.  Swap him for Trae and even guys like Elfried Payton and Markelle Fultz would put up 40 on this team on a nightly basis
"Hollinger and Duncan (podcast duo) actually just finished up a 2 part series on which teams they think are the best to support over the next 5 years.   Watch some highlights, read about some players, and listen to that and I think you'll have an idea. But don't stick too hard to one team at the start, you'll find what you like over time   &gt;Is youth development different in the NBA in comparison to hockey and soccer?  Very. In the NBA teams have nothing to do with the players basically until they are drafted.    &gt;Do players that get drafted in round 1 make the roster right away, or do they play in college for 4 years and then compete for a roster spot or play on the farm team  If you're a 1st round pick your contract is already guaranteed, so the team is gonna be paying you no matter what, so they pretty much all play on the team for at least a bit. Some of them won't last on their teams and in the league, but the guys at the top all generally do. The 2nd round is a different story, their contracts aren't guaranteed and the majority of them never make their teams roster and they never play in the NBA.   Players never draft someone and have them go to college, you'll kind of see it with Europeans who get drafted by a team but stay and play in Europe, but never still going to college. To be drafted players also have to be a year removed from highschool, which usually means playing a year in college before heading to the NBA.   &gt; I understand drafts are essential but do picks have very high value or do teams just trade them continually?  Picks have a high value, but it's a pretty steep value curve, the ones at the top are worth much more than ones later on. How this value works out depends on the draft and how many good players there are. A top 3 pick in a good draft can be worth five times a pick at 12. Teams do trade picks a lot, usually as a move to help them win now at the expense of success in the future. As such most of the picks that get traded are from good teams that are expecting their picks to not be very high anyway (examples like the Nets, Lakers, Bucks), but sometimes doesn't work out and not very good teams owe picks (Rockets, TWolves, the Nets of the past).     &gt;Are there lots of young players that get drafted later rounds that actually make it to the NBA rosters or do they get trapped on the farm team and used as trade bait/salary moves?   It's pretty common for 2nd round draft picks to make it onto NBA teams. It's less than half, especially as you get to the end of the draft, but not insignificant each draft. There's also stars that every once in a while come from the 2nd round, Jokic is currently an MVP candidate and he was the 41st pick. I wouldn't say they get trapped on the farm team (in the NBA this is called the G-League), but it's pretty common for them to be sent down to get reps. You will see 2nd round picks and players moved pretty often, they aren't seen to carry a lot of value, but they are probably the cheapest asset that is still positive value.   &gt;Do top picks bust frequently, as a Canadian, I do know that the hype on Wiggins and Bennett completely died out after 1 year. I haven't kept a close eye on them but it seems that they couldn't transition their game/skills to an NBA starter level?  I wouldn't say frequently, but it definitely ain't unheard of. I think failing to make it to the level of a starter is rarer (Wiggins is actually a starter), but it's pretty common to not meet expectations.   In 2018 Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick and probably won't be a good player, Markelle Fultz in 2017 was the 1st pick but immediately disappointed and is now just a good player, Dragan Bender in 2016 with the 4th pick is already out of the league. There seems to be at least one high level prospect per draft who doesn't get near their expectations.   &gt;I watch hockey and soccer, but the Salary Cap and contract situation in the NBA is much different, based on my understanding, it seems to promote rich owners to throw money and build super teams, so does it make the NBA a bit stale to watch?  There is a salary cap in the NBA, it's just a soft cap, and there is also a cap on the salaries of players. So you can go over the cap, but there are a bunch of restrictions to limit your ability to do so, primarily you can go over the cap to sign players that are already on your team, but you can't go over the cap to get other teams players. However, going over the cap does lead to you ending up in the luxury tax, which the more you go into the more expensive it gets  There's still a big market advantage, but it's to varying degrees. My Nets were able to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency because they are located in New York, but also because they have shown themselves to be a competent franchise who can get some modicum of success. While across the city the Knicks are the most valuable franchise in the NBA, and they haven't been able to get a free agent in close to 10 years because they are so bad. So rich owners (so long as they aren't cheap) have less impact, but the markets teams are in have an impact. The big exception to this I would say is the Lakers, who I think has just a massive free-agent advantage over other teams  On the other hand, some small-market teams are able to hold onto really high-level players over the long term. As I said before there is a player salary cap, where players can only be paid so much. But this quantity is affected by a range of things, firstly how long a player has been in the league, secondly if a player signs with their own team then they can get more and for longer, and thirdly if they are eligible for getting the supermax, which you have to reach certain performance levels for and you can only get re-signing with your team. For example, this led to Giannis Antetokounmpo resigning a 5-year supermax deal with his very small market team the Bucks   &gt;Which NBA organizations are the best to consider supporting for?    Listen to that aforementioned podcast. You want to get on board with a team that is still on the way up, and that once they get there they have a chance to stick around for a while. Just listening to your description of what you want in your team I'd consider anyone except Knicks, Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors because they tend to be the centres of a lot of drama and free agent talk, and just due to competence anyone except the Twolves, Kings, or Wizards, and maybe the Pistons  Just listening to your criteria I think Grizzlies might be a strong option, they are an alright team currently, but they are built around a great young core that should find success in the future. And the franchise has an incredibly strong identity that envelops the team, the Grizzlies are synonymous with Grit and Grind and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Oh and Ja Morant pretty frequently fucks people up with his dunks"
"1. About the Drummond situation, I don't think that Draymond has a problem with the Cavs not playing Drummond because he is on the trading block but rather how he was pulled from the bench and had to change attire, and continue to watch the game from the sidelines. If the organization wants him not to play, the proper way would be to inform the player before he arrives to the stadium to play to avoid the embarrassing situation that occured yesterday.   2. About Harrison Barnes being traded during a game and other players finding out from third-party or being straight-up lied to by GMs about where they stand with the team, players should be the first ones to find out if they have been traded so they can start preparing themselves and their FAMILIES without facing unwanted extra media attention. Furthermore, players should be informed if the team is entertaining trade offers for them so that they can mentally prepare themselves and their FAMILIES that they might have to relocate.  3. Thirdly, if the teams can publicly announce that they are going to trade a player, why can't a player publicly demand a trade? The team doesn't have to trade them if they don't want to. It's not like teams never leak information on players to the media without informing them.  4. If a player is going to be traded, and is not going to play why should he have to attend the games? What sense does it make for him to attend the games if he will inevitably be traded?  5. There is a reason trash teams remain trash. If Draymond was drafted by almost in any other team by the warriors, he would probably be out of the league right now. While young players like Markelle Fultz in Philadelphia, Lonzo Ball on the Lakers were constantly ridiculed for not living upto their potential; organizations such as the Portland Trailblazers never receive any backclash for ruining the career of a promising talent like Greg Oden by using experimental medical techniques; the San Antonio Spurs medical staff giving Kawhi Leonard the green light to play even with his constant protests, and later it was found out that he had several problems such as hematoma, tendinopathy, etc.  Finally, the NBA cannot be analysed in isolation of fans and media as they all exist in a nexus."
If we want to get technical we traded the Markelle Fultz pick to Boston which they subsequently sent to Philly for the 3rd pick (Tatum) and a future first.

Markelle Fultz? Huh?
Bruh ur team took Markelle Fultz over Jayson Tatum and your criticizing Ainges draft picks?
"Total historical revisionism, people were clowning Ainge for passing on Markelle Fultz to take Jayson Tatum. People were *destroying* Ainge for taking Jaylen Brown.   Most players who are drafted into the NBA don't pan out (how many second round picks can you name right now other than Draymond and Jokic). Ainge isn't perfect but people shitting on him for not drafting starters or 6MOY players in the teens and 20s of the draft are mistaken."
"Forgot about a lot of legends. I think some worth mentions are Pistons Isiah Thomas, Oscar Robertson, Jerry west, Gary payton. Tim Hardaway makes top 20. Dame lillard is climbing the ladder, and also malcom brogdon, ben simmons and markelle fultz are currently some of the best young talent capable of being top 30 at least. Also i think AI is SG. I think Derrick Rose and Penny Hardaway could have been better without injury. Derrick rose had potential to be top 5."

Lonzo and Markelle Fultz gonna be snipers
"It’s so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De’Aaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
"Signed Horford, traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.  Ainge gets a weird amount of hate for an absolutely stellar GM."
You shouldn't count Tatum. It should be Markelle Fultz strictly by the pick.
"I get that he had serious family issues, but much of the blame goes to him personally.   ""nerve issue"" is just a bullshit story, that he had to visit 15 doctors to get that one diagnosis.   It's the [insane muscle he grew](https://upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26121351/Markelle-Fultz-.jpg) before his rookie season. It's that bike incident that he tried to hide.   Combine that, and there you have it.   I play my whole life, Im a good shooter, there was that 1 year where I built my own house, which included lifting tons of heavy shit, blocks, mortar, 10k nails hammered, and so on. Once the summer season started, I couldnt hit a layup, let alone a 3pt. My shot and my form were so off, that I felt like I never played in my life. My arms were stronger but my shot was non-existent. I had to re-invent my shooting form that summer, from the basics.   On top of it all, he ""re-learned"" to shoot, by using the worst and the ugliest form ever, that ""stomach push"" that only works uncontested. Not a single player with that form is a good shooter, that's the same shit preventing Giannis to be the goat."
I think it's kind of wild that you go on the internet calling people insecure when they post Markelle Fultz quotes
Rookie Markelle Fultz
"Anthony Bennett, Ben Simmons (DNP), MKG, Derrick Williams, Evan Turner, and Markelle Fultz could all be at least argued to be worse."
This guy is truly the worst poster. These would all be Markelle Fultz career high in stats. Anyway Simmons is playing thru an obvious knee injury and hasn't been the same since. He's still better than whoever your favorite young player is unless its Zion or Luka.
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
Markelle Fultz? Idk
"Avoiding using Anthony Edwards, who is too young to see what's going on, here is where I'd rank the ones in the post-Jordan era. He's definitely above average.   1. Lebron James 2. Dwight Howard 3. Anthony Davis 4. Zion Williamson 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Derrick Rose 7. Blake Griffin 8. Ben Simmons 9. John Wall 10. Karl-Anthony Towns 11. Deandre Ayton 12. Yao Ming 13. Elton Brand 14. Andrew Bogut 15. Kenyon Martin 16. Greg Oden 17. Kwame Brown 18. Andrew Wiggins 19. Andrea Bargnani 20. Michael Olowakandi 21. Markelle Fultz 22. Anthony Bennett  Only one I feel bad about is Greg Oden. He was a bad pick beause his one leg was longer than the other, so he never got to see his prime, but his talent was there to be one of the best ones had been built for pro play.   Derrick Rose could go lower if you're judging solely on full career (and Zion probably doesn't belong as high), but we saw what he was at his peak, and it was an MVP, so that's why he's rated above a guy like Blake Griffin that had better longevity.   The Towns-Elton Brand grouping could also be shuffled up based on personal preference. Those guys are close, and I honestly feel Ayton probably ends up the best of the bunch."
Ben Simmons is more of a bust then Markelle Fultz
COUGH... COUGH... MARKELLE FULTZ... COUGH... COUGH
Markelle Fultz.
Don't forget about Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Issac.
Markelle Fultz
"you'd find this to be true at any selection.  DeAndre Ayton was the #1 pick and looks like a role player, Markelle Fultz will be lucky to be a solid role player at this point.  Same for Andrew Wiggins.  Is getting the #1 pick unlucky?"
Get lucky like with Markelle Fultz? Lmao
Send him to Orlando for Markelle Fultz
"Curious, what was the consensus from the sub for Markelle Fultz?  Were there any doubters that he should've gone at no. 1?  Looking back, it's crazy how much good talent there was behind him."
"This is a good answer, although I think if we’re going strictly based on lowest talent, I think going with a younger choice would be even better. The first name I thought of was Markelle Fultz. He’s nowhere near max caliber, but some fans could argue his upside enough to the point that the IRS wouldn’t bat an eye."
Drafting Markelle Fultz at 1 over Tatum/Fox
Harden and Westbrook were both reaches I think. Like KD was a no-brainer but those two picks are still impressive. Being able to actually evaluate top talent matters. Not being able to do so is how you end up taking Markelle Fultz over Jayson Tatum or Marvin Bagley over Luka Doncic.
"What improvements has he shown? I watched him play at UGA and it's the same thing. An inefficient chucker who shows you incredible athletic flashes 2-3 times a game. He still has defensive effort questions still lingering as well. If you look at every #1 pick rookie year in the last decade, he's only been better than Anthony Bennett and Markelle Fultz. If anything, he's vastly overrated atm."
"It's important to note the absurd severity of the allergic reaction.   He nearly died, had a hole in his throat, and lost a crazy amount of weight.  &gt; Bedridden, in constant pain, and unable to eat or drink, Zhaire could only sleep for 30 minutes at a time, and only with the help of morphine. He spent his nights watching 76ers game films and doing some informal scouting for coach Brett Brown, who would check in with him on FaceTime. Then-teammate Markelle Fultz often texted, but Zhaire rarely had the energy to respond. He was too weak to do physical activities, save for thumb wars with Aundre, who slept by his side at the hospital each night. Zhaire’s days were spent meditating with his mom, Andrea. The only other way to help Zhaire relax was the repetitive motion of twisting his hair. “They were calming me down, but I was throwing temper tantrums,” Zhaire says. “Everyday, I was like, ‘Am I getting out? Can I drink? Can I eat? I was so thirsty.”’  &gt;A few weeks before Thanksgiving, Zhaire returned home with a feeding tube, three other tubes, a 24-hour nurse, and the steady, constant presence of Andrea and Aundre, who lived a few minutes away. Down to 160 pounds, he was too weak to do pushups or lift weights."
I think they lacked another true all star. Also Jonathan Isaac and Markelle fultz haven’t had a postseason in the last two years together🤷‍♂️
"Let’s see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It’s absolutely crazy to not reward GM’s for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he’s better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don’t know why people use this as an argument."
Markelle Fultz  Michael Carter Williams  Larry Hughes  Jahlil Okafor  Shawn Bradley
Like Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith amirite
Played with Markelle Fultz in high school (Chase Young also was on the team apparently)
"My point is he is good dude. Yeah yeah he saw all that, but that is a testament to his foresight, not a reflection on him being unlucky.   Your argument for injuries making him one of the unluckiest GMs around is seriously flawed.  Here I'll take a homer approach. Imagine Embiid is perfectly healthy the day we draft Ben Simmons, and neither gets injured after that. Or scratch that and Markelle Fultz never forgets how to shoot. Or go further back and look at Andrew Bynum  Or add the factor of time and be a Warriors fan in the Finals without Klay and KD.  Or be a Rockets fan with TMac and Yao  I mean come on"
"You say that he sits on his hands when he has made multiple big time trades (one that even won a championship) in his tenure. Recently we made the Kyrie trade which was a massive deal. We also traded Markelle Fultz for Jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford, we traded Pierce and KG for the picks that got us Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown + more, we traded for Kevin Garnett and went from the worst team in the league to the NBA champions the next year, we traded for Isaiah Thomas who became 4th in MVP voting. This narrative is straight bullshit. This sub seems to think that we need to make a major roster shaking deal each year which is straight up dumb. Our 2 best players are 23 and 24, we have no reason to rush the process and shorten their championship window to win now when neither of them are in their prime yet."
If that drives you crazy YouTube Markelle Fultz jumpshot videos
Eh... he's been one of the unluckiest GMs around. He just manages to turn those situations into good outcomes.  * Had the Big 3 era Celtics derailed prematurely by injuries (they should have won 1 more chip) * #3 pick in a 2-man draft - Only looks good because he reached down for the 9th pick. * #1 pick in a draft where the clear cut #1 was a bust no one but him saw coming - Only looks good because he reached down for the 4th pick. * Had the new Big 3 era Celtics derailed by injuries (3 All-Stars with major injuries within 1 calendar year). Including one guy who was coming off a year Top 5 in MVP voting.    Other GMs with his 'luck' would have a roster spearheaded by Dragan Bender and Markelle Fultz right now.
"Most franchises should wish they had Tatum and Brown  While everyone is trashing Ainge I’d also like to bring up the fact that he turned Markelle Fultz into Jayson Tatum and a pick - I mean, maybe Langford doesn’t develop into anything, but that’s a DEAL"
For me it’s more “what if Markelle Fultz didn’t have his basketball skill sucked out of his body by a Gypsy spell” but I guess they’re interchangeable lol
Those picks could have easily been Dragan Bender and Markelle Fultz. Ainge deserves a ton of credit for how those picks turned out. Especially trading down to get Tatum
"Hey, come on now. We parted with Markelle Fultz to take Jayson Tatum off of your hands, remember?"
"He literally got a franchise corner stone AND a first round pick for Markelle Fultz. And then he traded for an all star and signed another in free agency, all within the last 3-4 years.  And people like you are still dogging him."
"**TEAM (NOT CURSED) ORLANDO MAGIC**  Workaholic Steve Clifford spends a few extra hours in his basement every night, tinkering with a time machine that allows his team to play 2020-21 completely healthy.  Armed with a solid core that went 42-40 in the past, coupled with rising young talent in Markelle Fultz and Jon Isaac, the Magic looked well suited to return to the playoff field. The up-and-down shooting continues to plague their upside, but their strong defensive play allows the group to finish with a 45-37 record and the # 6 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the Magic match up against Philadelphia (who drops to # 3 by the time the playoffs roll around.) Orlando gives a good fight, but Ben Simmons stymies his old teammate Fultz and leaves the Magic a little too offensively challenged to get over the hump. The Magic go home, 4-2."
"&gt; Based on what?  Based on their defensive skill sets.   &gt; Im telling you what Milwaukee did. They clearly thought Fournier was someone worth targeting on defense, they did it and it worked.   And I’m trying to explain to you why using a 5 game bubble sample for a guy coming off covid who played like shit all around relative to his general standards is an absurd way to judge defensive value. Fournier was targeted in both the milwaukee and Toronto series because of our lack forward depth that meant he had to switch onto or even straight up match up with dudes like siakam, Kawhi, and giannis. That is not an issue for the lakers. In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier.   &gt; Fournier guarding the opponents top option frequently is a byproduct of Orlando's roster not his actual defensive capabilities. Who else is going to chase Dame Lillard around a million screens, Aaron Gordon?  In theory it should be markelle fultz, the 6’4” hyper athletic young point guard. But it’s not because Evan is a very good defender and his size bothers guards a lot on the perimeter. Another funny thing to point out is that you’re saying our perimeter personnel is trash defensively and that’s the only reason Fournier gets the best assignment, but we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years, despite our other back court defenders being Fultz, DJ Augustin, terrence ross, so clearly he’s doing something right. If we were just getting torched on the perimeter every night that couldn’t be true."
"Literally just in the last 3.5 years   -  June 19, 2017: Traded a 2017 1st round draft pick (Markelle Fultz was later selected) to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected)  - July 7, 2017: Traded Avery Bradley and a 2019 2nd round draft pick (Isaiah Roby was later selected) to the Detroit Pistons for Marcus Morris.  - August 30, 2017: Traded Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Ante Žižić, a 2018 1st round draft pick (Collin Sexton was later selected) and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Skylar Mays was later selected) to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Kyrie Irving.   - July 6, 2019: Traded Aron Baynes and Ty Jerome to the Phoenix Suns for a 2020 1st round draft pick (Desmond Bane was later selected). (top-7 protected)  - July 6, 2019: Traded Terry Rozier and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Grant Riller was later selected) to the Charlotte Hornets for Kemba Walker and a 2020 2nd round draft pick (Yam Madar was later selected)."
let's be honest with ourselves. the only reason you give a fuck is because it's kyrie and you're a celtics fan. if it was markelle fultz we're talking about you wouldn't give a fuck.
Markelle Fultz
"you can play a sport without caring about it at the professional level  had friends in HS who were super good basketball players who never watched a game in their lives, never gave a shit about it  hell, markelle fultz was a #1 overall pick who didnt know how many teams there were  dude as athletic as A1 probably just played any sport he could lol"
"Markelle Fultz wasn’t good on the sixers but has been really good on the magic, until he got injured."
Ben Simmons is the exact opposite of Markelle Fultz and it’s insufferable.
"Protections vary depending on the terms of the trade, and they're evaluated after the lottery takes place. [This massive page](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed) can help you figure out the details of specific picks.   If you scroll down to Houston and look at the first item in the outgoing column, the situation for the pick in question is there.  &gt;  **2021 first round draft pick to Oklahoma City (swap, less favorable of Oklahoma City or Miami incoming)** Oklahoma City will receive the two most favorable of its 2021 1st round pick, Miami's 2021 1st round pick and Houston's 2021 1st round pick protected for selections 1-4 and Houston will receive the least favorable of the three (via Miami to Phoenix to Philadelphia to L.A. Clippers to Oklahoma City; via Oklahoma City's right to swap Oklahoma City or Miami for Houston); **if the Houston pick falls within its protected range and is therefore not conveyable, then Houston's obligation to Oklahoma City will be extinguished** and Oklahoma City will instead receive its pick and the Miami pick [Miami-New Orleans-Phoenix, 2/19/2015; Philadelphia-Phoenix, 6/21/2018; L.A. Clippers-Philadelphia, 2/6/2019; L.A. Clippers-Oklahoma City, 7/10/2019; Houston-Oklahoma City, 7/16/2019]; Houston may convey this pick to Brooklyn in 2021 (see Houston Incoming)  So if they do get pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the lottery, they don't have to give OKC anything in return. There's only a 52.1% chance of that happening.  That's not always the norm. A lot of trades will have some sort of caveat where if a protected pick doesn't convey one year, then the next year's pick is owed (sometimes with looser protections). But pick swaps (which I think this is) seem to be options that apply only to a single year at a time.   Random history example: The Kings once traded away a 1st round pick that was protected top 14 the first year, top 13 the next, then top 12, then top 10 for the next 3 years, and then became a 2nd round pick after they failed so many years in a row to win enough games to convey the pick. That final year, the Kings pick that they kept jumped in the lottery to #3 and swapped with Philly down to #5 due to a different trade. Philly traded the #3 pick to Boston to get #1 and draft Markelle Fultz. Boston used the #3 pick on Jayson Tatum. The Kings used the #5 pick on DeAaron Fox. The second round pick conveyed instead went to Chicago, who eventually sold it to the Warriors, who drafted Jordan Bell with it."

Markelle Fultz  Edit: do you mean actually fallen out of the league or just fallen off in terms of their value
"currently markelle fultz,   year 1 yips   year 2 some type of shoulder injury   year 3 learning curve with injuries here and there   year 4 acl"
markelle fultz
Markelle Fultz Never Forget
He went to the Luka Doncic and Jaren Jackson Mavericks and then went back to Washington with the number 1 pick in 2032 and Cade Cunningham to win 3 more rings before retiring after 21 seasons. He averaged 1 PPG in 6 of those. Markelle Fultz also became an MVP for the Bucks after they traded Giannis for DPOY Day'ron Sharpe. It was an epic simulation.
"if the celtics wanted to draft a point guard, they would’ve just kept their first pick for markelle, or zo if they really wanted him/saw warning signs in fultz. also the lakers choosing tatum feels super unlikely, lonzo was pretty consensus \#2 even without the LA connection, while tatum was pretty consistently mocked ~5 and below"
"Ah, the ""Markelle Fultz"" as we call it in Philly."
Gives me Markelle fultz vibes
Imagine thinking paul george is better than jayson tatum. You're just salty you could have had him instead of markelle fultz
"You also needed shot creation from the perimeter, which is why they drafted Markelle Fultz. Tobias Harris isn’t gonna give you that consistently enough. Jimmy’s playmaking and ability to still draw defenders out on the perimeter, even with his declining shooting is far more valuable than Tobias Harris."
Markelle fultz. Now there is a name I didn’t think would be in this list.   Man if only he could play like he did in college. The kid just has an uncanny way of dribbling the ball. Pleasure to watch.
"And don’t forget his biggest success, Markelle Fultz!  Cries in Sixers"
mix in a bit of markelle fultz
"I mean this is kind of what the whole issue of “the process” was. That the NBA cannot afford to allow teams in a terrible spot to blatantly tank and not try to win, because it completely destroys the legitimacy of any competition when there are bad actors who aren’t trying to win. It becomes a version of the Globetrotters in that case.  This entire narrative drives me insane. Like technically what the sixers did during the process was legal, but the NBA had no choice but to step in. Even as a sixers fan, are you really saying you want to watch a league where at absolute minimum 1/3 of the league literally wants to lose a game they are playing in? That sixers roster of 2011 (I think) quite literally had 0 players who would ever even make another NBA roster.   Silver is not good at his job, imo, but I really don’t at all understand how philly fans try to justify purposefully losing as if that is some sort of genius strategy, when in reality it completely ruins the idea of any sort of competition when it happens.   I will absolutely die on this hill, but the idea that “tanking” should be supported or encouraged in any way is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I’m pre-disposed to dislike sixers fans because I’m a boston sports fan, but goddam how in the world do so many of you try to justify “the process” as if it wasn’t something that made the NBA a joke. You were the Chicago White Sox world series scandal, but just not talented enough to make it matter at all. You actively and purposefully tried to lose, completely ignoring that doing so invalides the larger competition you are a part of, and somehow convinced yourselves that your franchise is the victim here.   I don’t hate philly fans in general, but the amount of you who defend “the process” is beyond infuriating. As if you all think no one else in the NBA has ever considered literally not trying to win for 5 years to get good picks. And unfortunately it worked out great for you, but the problem is that you guys so aggressively took advantage of a broken system, that you could BLOW your #1 pick on Markelle Fultz, instead of Tatum, and still be in a great spot.   Call me crazy, but maybe telling teams that all they need to do is lose on purpose for 4 years to find success is a bad idea. Maybe that did need to be cracked down on.  I have no idea how philly fans can’t understand why what their franchise did needs to be attacked and criticized. Somehow we have normalized just not trying to win at all in this context which I really don’t get."
Not to mention Markelle Fultz
if he plays long enough and stays healthy markelle fultz could beat this
Fultz was supposed to be the off-ball guard who was our secondary playmaker. Fultz would have had the tools to flourish in that tole whereas all of Ben's offense revolves around him with the ball so I doubt that would have been the case. I'd be thinking moreso John Wall / Beal roles if things worked out but we'll never know because Markelle royally fucked us.
"Nah thybulle has a better chance of starting on a good team and it's not even close. Tbh, Maxey may too.   19/20 fultz put up numbers comparable to Elfrid Payton, 12/5 on below average efficiency. Thybulle is 6th on the dpoy ladder and maxey has similar stats to markelle per 100 possessions and is younger. If maxey was on a bad team like fultz he'd probably also be starting. What indicates that fultz will be a better player?"
Turning the first pick into that is horrible. Turning Markelle Fultz into that is great.  A good rookie and all defensive player vs a guy with 48%TS who's injured all the time
People in this thread just can’t let Sixers fans appreciate a silver lining to the obvious catastrophe that was everything related to Markelle Fultz.
"You salty that Markelle Fultz was picked before you? As a 76ers fan, I am."
Also people underrate how much Danny Ainge reached for those picks.   The average GM walks out of those drafts with Kris Dunn / Dragan Bender and Markelle Fultz.
Do you ever poke fun at markelle fultz. For your draft order?
I will always be a fan of whatever team Matisse Thybulle and Markelle Fultz are on. They played for my university and I got to meet and talk to them personally. Kelle only a little bit but I was genuinely a friendly acquaintance with Matisse. I’m like 30% sure if he saw me right now he would recognize me. Also whatever team KD is on is a team I’ll like.
"And this news was posted on the college basketball subreddit too. Should the mods have removed all news about the Olympics, or Cade Cunningham, Luka Doncic, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz prior to being drafted too?

"Laughs in Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, MCW, James Ennis, Mo Bamba, Terrence Ross, Otto Porter JR (I don’t even remember when he got hurt), and pretty much anyone not named Dwayne freaking Bacon.  Dwayne Bacon can survive a nuclear catastrophe unscathed.  That man will not get hurt or sick,  he’s the true iron man of the NBA."
He'll never play all 82 games as long as there are back-to-backs in the schedule. But it's definitely possible for him to get thru a season uninjured. 2 seasons ago the only injury he suffered was a facial fracture in a freak accident with markelle fultz
Adding in Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Isaac’s injuries torpedoing the Magic’s season
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
"He also made one the underrated worst trades in recent memory: a salary dump that cost them 2 pick swaps and a future first.  In 2015, Vlade traded Nik ""Rocks"" Stauskas, Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, the future first, and swaps in '16-'17 to the Sam Hinkie Sixers for the rights to Arturas Gudaitis and Luka Mitrovic.  IIRC Danny Leroux, cap wonk from the Athletic and the Duncd On podcast has said this transaction was ""unpardonable."" The Kings ended up whiffing on major free agents and ended up signing Rondo with the cap sapce.  Savor that for a moment. The kings essentially gave up 2 1st round swaps, and a 1st round pick to clear cap space to Rondo as a free agent.   That swap became a big part of the Fultz saga for the Sixers.   The 2017 lottery ping pong balls gave Sixers the 5th pick, and the Kings the 3rd pick. Because of the swap, the picks flipped; the Sixers received the 3rd pick and the Kings the 5th pick.  Bryan ""Normal Collars"" Colangelo traded the 3rd pick and a future first to move up to 1st  so the sixers could draft Markelle Fultz. The Celtics picked Tatum with the 3rd pick.  So that's a long way of writing: ""...also fuck Colangelo and Adam Silver for putting him in charge of the Sixers."""

They broke markelle fultz there's no two ways about it, don't take somebody who made it to the highest level of basketball and try to deconstruct their entire shot to make it a little bit better it's not going to work.

It is a ridiculous rabbit hole to jump through.  One of them pretended to be a gay disabled parking attendant that knew Bryan Colangelo and said hello to him every day.  It's insanity.

Crowd giving Giannis the Markelle Fultz treatment at the line
"Markelle Fultz is a bust, sorry."
Markelle Fultz isn't even a bust. Way too early to call young guys a failure.
where does it rank on the spectrum of Markelle Fultz to trading the rights to Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith?  Somewhere around a Jahlil Okafor?
"Tbh Clarke regressed pretty bad this year. His shot took a Markelle Fultz like dip, and he really struggled defensively, meanwhile Tillman looks like be could be a serviceable backup."
"Oh yeah, teach me how not to draft someone like Markelle Fultz or Jahlil Okafor."
"Some guys I was REALLY high on at recent Celtics draft positions:  -  * 2020, Pick #26: **Tyrell Terry** – got Payton Pritchard instead  * 2019, Pick #14: **Sekou Doumbouya or Goga Bitadze** – I'd still take either over Romeo Langford but none are really blowing up the league  * 2017, Pick #1: **Markelle Fultz** – got Jayson Tatum instead  * 2016, Pick #3: Take **Dragan Bender** or trade down and get **Jakob Poeltl** – got Jaylen Brown instead  * 2014, Pick #6: I thought **Noah Vonleh** was the new Chris Bosh – got Marcus Smart instead"
when I heard that the Celtics were trading down from #1 and not drafting Markelle Fultz I lost my mind.
hows Markelle Fultz playing?
Are we sure Simmons didnt catch what Markelle Fultz had?
Markelle Fultz
Markelle fultz. Tank commander
Rebuild? Markelle Fultz? Brett Brown is unemployed and available
Johnathan Issac is pretty dope.  Michael Carter-Williams looked like he had played basketball before. Mo Bamba is really tall. Markelle Fultz was a #1 pick for some reason.
Lol imagine spending two firsts on Markelle fucking Fultz.
Remember Markelle Fultz?
That's some Sixer Markelle Fultz form
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
"We don't really have any other lead guard playmakers on this team (besides Tyrese Maxey who is a rookie and still pretty rough around the edges). Seth curry, Tobias, Shake, korkmaz are all secondary playmaker types. I mean, we had Danny Green bringing the ball up the floor at one point this season with Ben and a handful of other players in the COVID protocol. George Hill should help with that but he is not the player he used to be. In a way we still have a Markelle Fultz / Jimmy Butler sized hole in our roster from a perimeter offensive initiator perspective"
"We as a league were a Markelle Fultz decision away from having a Tatum, Simmons, and Embiid 76ers team. A homemade super team."
What Markelle Fultz was supposed to be.
Maxey is what Markelle Fultz was supposed to be.  Jerky weird fast
https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/4066636/markelle-fultz  just guessing since he's only played one full season
Found Markelle Fultz.
"for sure, the draft cycle definitely pushes towards the outliers and puts unreasonable/unrealistic comparisons on players while also severely misjudging what the expected return is from a pick.  Like, we got a 98th percentile outcome on LeBron's career.  He was better than he was hyped up to be and was indestructible for 15 solid years.  Getting Blake Griffin as an outcome when you could have Anthony Bennett/Markelle Fultz/Greg Oden/Andrew Wiggins is something NBA GMs would do 100 times out of 100.  I think Blake got hate from players in the league early in his career because he was trying to end people's lives with dunks and played a super physical style that rubbed people the wrong way, also he became a super famous star before he'd ""done anything"" in the league.  Once he was established and developed his skills, then the Clippers were annoying (Doc/Blake/CP3/JJ Redick whining for calls incessantly was seriously brutal to watch) and hyped and ultimately not winning gave the haters plenty of fodder.  All of that overshadows stretches where Blake was a force of nature and carried those Clipper teams to wins night after night.  That run on the Clippers is so overshadowed I've literally had to get in arguments on r/nba where people were saying his Detroit season in 2019 was the best of his career (nephews, please)."
"Christian Wood,Brook Lopez,Markelle Fultz,Robert Covington,Jusuf Nurkic,Jordan Clarkson,TJ Warren,Spencer Dinwiddie,Seth Curry,Joe Ingles and Jae Crowder  All these players make the same or less amount of money as Kuzma next year"
"“Who would be better, Ja Morant or Markelle Fultz if he was good?”"
Today Fultz Shoulder set the record for most pathetic loser who is mad Ben Simmons is on a hall of fame track and Markelle Fultz is a g leaguer. Also this thread is full of the most moronic posters. Obviously Simmons needs to hit his foul shots but he’s been playing great otherwise and he’s not gonna shoot 0%.
He inherited that Markelle fultz disease didnt he
"Yeah it's still Chris ""Markelle Fultz"" Paul out there  This series is ovah"
"Nothing really wrong with Orlando imo, but the team is in fucking no-man's land. Their roster is in no-man's land - Bamba and Isaac are always injured (Bamba is a much worse case, seeing as how he's barely played at all and only has one season left on his rookie contract before he needs an extension) and Markelle Fultz still isn't good enough to build around. The front office has shown that they have no idea what the fuck their goals are"
An NBA team traded up for Markelle Fultz over Tatum
I know this isnt the case but my favorite consirapcy theory about Markelle Fultz was that he was just randomly hot for the 20 games or whatever he played in college
Fuck you Markelle Fultz
We selected Markelle Fultz instead of this man.
Trading up to get Markelle Fultz while the Celtics get Tatum who they wanted all along.. lmfao
Just imagine a NBA team took Markelle Fultz over Tatum
Did the Celtics lose the Markelle fultz trade?
If Markelle Fultz worked out the way it was supposed sixers would have a chip by now. He was the perfect fit
I feel fucking SICK that the Sixers drafted Markelle Fultz over Jayson FUCKING Tatum. Man is going off tonight
"Markelle Fultz  Most hyped prospect of a stacked draft and then he somehow forgets how to shoot. If you watch him, his instincts are excellent, solid passer, cuts to the rim like butter, youngest player to ever record a triple double. The only thing his game is missing is that consistent shot. Would've been such a fun player to watch."
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
"Top 3 picks can be very good, but they also bust more often then people realize. The Sixers got Simmons and Embiid, but they also drafted Evan Turner, Markelle Fultz and Jahlil Okafor with Top 3 picks."
"Well, he did fleece the number one seeded 76ers as well in the Markelle Fultz trade. Ainge wins the battles but ultimately loses the wars."
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Markelle Fultz The Bust? I thought not. It’s not a story the NBA would tell you.
"1. reggie miller  2. danny granger  3. lance stephenson  4. rashard lewis  5. terrell brandon  6. alvin williams  7. markelle fultz  8. shabazz muhammad  9. shareef abdur-rahim  10. cliff robinson, qwyntel woods, darius miles  if edmond sumner stays in indy for a long time, he will be on this list"
The funny thing is the Sixers actually did trade for Jonathan Simmons a few seasons ago. He was part of the Markelle Fultz deal
&gt; smart drafting  2013 - Michael Carter-Williams (11)  2014 - Elfrid Payton (10)  2015 - Jahlil Okafor (3)  2017 - Markelle Fultz (1)  Go on...
It could be worse you could have a Markelle Fultz jersey
"Not the last 5 years but I thought Ben Mclemore was gonna be an all-star when he was drafted.  To answer your question though, Markelle Fultz."
Trade Markelle Fultz for him
Kinda like walking into drafting Markelle Fultz. 😬
"Lonzo's actually good tho. I'd argue that the guy picked above him, Markelle Fultz, is more fitting (Markelle's getting better tho)."
markelle fucking fultz
"??? he’s had injury problems since before the draft. of course he’s injury prone. he broke his foot and missed two years. he’s avoided any really big injuries since 2017 though, although i guess in 2019 his knee did kinda flare up in the second half of the season   in 2020 he only missed games because his finger bent 5 different ways and then some big man on cleveland yanked his shoulder. in 2018 he only really missed games bc he ran into markelle fultz’ shoulder and broke his face. and this year he only missed one after landing badly on his knee  the medical staff should be blamed for letting him play in 2017 on a torn meniscus. other than that he’s just injury prone"
Markelle Fultz had the yips
this explains why markelle fultz sucks
I am no longer watching basketball until Markelle Fultz is healthy. If I was 21 I’d be an alcoholic because of this season. At least the Bucs won the Super Bowl.
Markelle Fultz  Jimmer  Anthony Bennett  Gustavo Ayon  Darko Milicic
Markelle Fultz
"And Kidd wasn't nearly as bad at shooting as people would have you believe, he just wasn't a scorer and his total FG% was pretty low because he wasn't a ""get to the rim on dunk on someone or hit a trick layup"" guy as much as some other guards. He shot 32.5% on threes for his first ten seasons, compared to the league average of 35.4% (and a higher percent of his shots were threes than the average - 27.3% of his shot attempts vs 18.1% average). Not great, but not like he was Ben Simmons or Michael Carter-Williams or Markelle Fultz or dear god, why can't young Sixers ""guards"" shoot?"
Terrence Ross + Markelle Fultz
"Not really though. I think you could argue the job of the players is to win. Your team gets a #1 pick, and selects a guy. You’d be ok if he was like Markelle fultz as Long as he played, since that’s all he is required to do? Then why do we shit on Ben simmons? He is doing what’s expected of him after all."
who cares about shit like this. markelle fultz said he wanted to win mvp his rookie year.
"""There's too much fucking shit on me.""  ""I don't to be around anymore""  -Markelle Fultz"
Big Markelle Fultz energy. He said something incredibly similar pre draft. Hope Cade has a better fortune than Kelle
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
Markelle Fultz but his 1 year was in college
"Celtics had the King's 2019 1st Round Pick *unprotected* and Ainge held on to it thinking it would be a #1 overall. It ended up being #14 and the Celtics were able to select Romeo Langford in what ended up being an overall very top-heavy draft with only Thybulle, Claxton, Horton-Tucker, Terrance Mann, and Paschall getting real play time in spots below #14.   Even 1 or 2 spots up and Boston could have had a starter or very very solid young Role Player.  Pretty hilarious considering that the origin of the pick was an absolute FLEECING by Philly. Taking on some bad contracts and Nik Stauskus for the 2019 1st.   Then Philly basically got to select Markelle Fultz by swapping picks with Boston with the bonus of this King's pick.   It's kind of funny the way they all ended up. I can't really say anyone destroyed each other with all these crazy trades and I'd only say Boston is the winner because they ended up with Tatum."
"Something's gonna happen in Brooklyn. Either Harden or Irving is leaving,  Lamelo Ball is top 5 in MVP voting.  Jimmy Butler or Spo leaves the Heat. I see spo taking Pat Riley's job and then whoever is coming in as head coach gets into it with Jimmy he leaves.  Markelle Fultz coming out party. 25ppg  Knicks implode or get Zack Lavine from chicago  &amp;#x200B;  And that's all I have"
"Right. Sometimes a team wants to get rid of a player Immediately. At the very least, the next season doesn’t start for another 3 months. It only takes one team to talk themselves Into it.  Though, ideally, would the 76ers not want a playmaker back? Otherwise, who’s their point guard? I bet they sure could use a healthy, to his full potential Markelle Fultz right about now…"
You take on Ben Simmons to flip him for Markelle FultZ
even a bit of markelle fultz tbh
"Wizards got all the PG County boys let’s gooooooo. KD, Oladipo, Uncle Jeff Green, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Markelle Fultz, Quinn Cook, the list goes on."
"&gt;PHI fucked up bad bad  Only in retrospect. At the time, Fultz was a consensus #1 pick for good reason. In college, he shot &gt; 40% from 3 on 5 attempts/game, along with a good mid-range game. He just... fell apart when he got to the NBA for some reason.   Read the [pre-draft coverage](https://www.theringer.com/2016/12/2/16046182/washington-markelle-fultz-2017-nba-draft-bc5913d07fc2):  &gt;He’s big, he’s fast, he can shoot and pass the ball, and he has a good feel for the game. He has hit the ground running in college, averaging 22.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists a game on 54 percent shooting in his first seven games.    That’s why Fultz’s red-hot start from the perimeter at Washington is so encouraging. He’s not just a physical specimen; he’s a threat from outside, too. He couldn’t always rely on his size to score, as he was a 5-foot-9 sophomore on the junior varsity team at Maryland’s DeMatha Catholic High School, one of the most prestigious high school basketball programs in the country, before a late growth spurt. Fultz is shooting 48.1 percent from 3 on 3.9 attempts from beyond the arc a game, and there’s just not much any defender can do if a guard with his size can consistently make 3s off the dribble.  Or the [draft guide](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/2017/)  &gt;Good shooter off the dribble. Pulls up on a dime. Has height and lift to shoot over guards."
"Markelle Fultz was also ""consensus"" number one. teams have to evaluate picks from their philosophical position on basketball rather than listen to 29 other dudes whose goals are nefarious.   I'm not saying Cade is Fultz, I'm just saying, the ""consensus"" stuff that circulates in the NBA media can sometimes be pretty dishonest."
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don’t pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"To get Markelle Fultz all the Sixers had to give was their 3rd pick and pick a year later. Given that the **perceived** gap between Cade and Green is much smaller than the perceived gap between Markelle and Tatum/Jackson/Fox/Smith was at the time I imagine it’d be a similar package. The question is if Houston would give their (likely) great pick next year. If they do, I’d imagine they could get a deal done pretty easily. At most I can imagine the deal being the #2 pick, next years pick, and 1 or 2 of the picks the Rockets got in the Nets trade.  If that’s the amount they need to use to move up and get Cade I don’t think it’s worth it. This is just me, and I’m sure some people disagree but I think the difference between Cade and Green/Mobley/Suggs isn’t big enough to warrant the Rockets giving up what I consider an excellent prospect this year and what *should* be an excellent prospect next year."
&gt;The Philadelphia 76ers are keen on Washington star Markelle Fultz
"I wonder if Markelle Fultz, Rajon Rondo, and Lonzo Ball could be involved. Just shuffle around a bunch of PGs who shoot like garbage."
"Can see it now, The Sixers trade Ben Simmons to Orlando for Markelle Fultz"
I'd give up Tobias and this year's first for Lowry in S&amp;T in a heartbeat. Sign Lowry 2 years around 25million... I'd have no problem with it.  Keep Simmons and get him with a true PG while Maxey develops.  What Markelle Fultz was supposed to be but instead Sixers have persisted without a true PG for so long.

Most Draft boards had Andrew Wiggins number 1 and they were proven wrong. Most Draft boards had Jahlil Okafor number 1. Most Draft boards had Markelle Fultz. It's a crap shoot. Especially in a year with no college basketball or workouts 2020 was a hard year to gage.
"Ahh, Sixers greats Markelle Fultz and Ben Simmons."
Markelle Fultz and Cade Cunningham
"&gt;It is doesn't matter what happened to the guys they did or didn't trade for.   It absolutely does, especially if you're going to sit here a decade later and say ""it would have been a disaster for the Hornets"" to have got a young Goran Dragic. Can I sit here and say ""it would have been a disaster for the Celtics to trade away the rights to draft Markelle Fultz"" just because at the time everyone thought he was the consensus #1 pick and Tatum was a reach at #3? Of course not.  We have the benefit of hindsight now, we are allowed to use it, and hindsight clearly shows that the vetoed trade would have been better for the Hornets than the one they actually made was. Honestly it's foolish to try to argue otherwise."
"what???  OP: markelle can’t shoot  also OP: it’s ironic because they’re stuck with another non-shooter  what does one guy’s jumpshot have to do with another’s???  they literally traded away fultz because they can’t play TWO non-shooters, they thought an offense having just ONE would be passable  where is the contradiction???"
"gold like markelle fultz, nerlens noel, and ben simmons  but james harden aint worth that i guess"
I promise you fans of every team know Markelle Fultz isn’t good at basketball
Cause shooting was a much bigger part of Markelle  game than Ben  Ben is better than Fultz by a pretty good margin
"Don’t really agree at all, I can clearly remember Markelle being a consensus #1, even moreso than Cade. Most people thought Lonzo was a franchise changer at #2, and thought he was a clear step below Fultz. Just feels like revisionist history to me"
"In the last 13 years, since 2007, five guards - Anthony Edwards, Markelle Fultz (yikes), Kyrie Irving, John Wall, and Derrick Rose - have been taken #1.      Only Fultz was a mistake IMO."
Is there a worse return to back to back #1 overall picks than Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz.   You would think your franchise would be set with back to back #1 picks yet the only reason we are still relevant is that Embiid got injured and he fell to us at #3. How ugly would it have been if we got Jabari or Wiggins instead?
Kuzma and the 22nd pick for Markelle Fultz

My team picked Ben Simmons and then Markelle Fultz #1 so I have no freaking clue.
"100% agree.  Hinkie set them up masterfully.  People forget that the only reason we even had the opportunity to botch the Markelle Fultz pick is because of how badly Hinkie swindled the Kings.  Sacramento actually won the third pick that year, but we had a pick swap that allowed us to initially move up to #3.  I won't rehash just how badly the Colangelos botched the situation.  I've also said many times before that I disagreed at the time with going all-in for both Butler and Harris.  I realize that Philly was ""star-chasing"", but after the success of 2017-18 by surrounding Embiid and Simmons with shooters, I would have loved to run that group back and add organically.  Going into 2018-19, Philly could have had a roster of Simmons/Reddick/Covington/Saric/Embiid/Ilyasova/Bellinelli/Shamet/MPJ or Bridges.  They still presumably would have been able to draft Thybulle in the 20s the following year.  Looking at that group, you've surrounded Embiid and Simmons with a bunch of shooters and/or defenders.  Alternatively, because I don't believe LeBron was ever coming, if you were star chasing, I would have made the offer for Paul George as opposed to Butler.  Yes, I know George had his eye on LA, but he would have been a much better fit with Embiid and Simmons, and he did eventually re-sign in OKC, only wanting out when it became apparent that the Thunder weren't going to win a championship.  Oh well, hindsight..."
"A locked gym with a screen streaming YouTube videos of white guys shooting along with Drew Hanlen, Chip Engelland, JJ Redick, Ben's current and last 3 girlfriends (they distract each other), shitload of psychedelics, hypnotization experts, and Markelle Fultz (for confidence boosting)."
"The Sixers get criticized because they were SO overt about it.   The front office was setting a team up for failure.   What's more, they have little in the way to show for it.   Noel?   Okafor?  Michael Carter-Williams?  Markelle Fultz?  Elfird Payton/Dario Saric?   And Ben Simmons.  They spent YEARS losing to pick up all those players.  And the only one who is still with the team has show no progress in his five years with the team.   The only player who panned out was Joel Embiid, and they got him in 2016.    Trying to WIN and build organically around Embiid would have been far easier for the Sixers than tanking every years.  We've seen with the Warriors that exceptional scouting and player development is the best approach to the draft.  Their dynasty was build primarily through the draft (Curry, Klay, Dray, and Barnes), none of whom were even top-five picks, and a couple of shrewd trades (for Bogut) that made the team a landing spot for free agents like Durant.  When you are winning, free agents are drawn to your team.  They had a sucky year last year, and it was not much better this year due to injury, but they still made a sincere effort to reach the playoffs.  And they still have great draft positioning with a early first-round pick in Wiseman on the roster now, and two lottery picks coming their way.   Sure... you can fairly expect to suck for a couple years during a rebuild and get a couple of early picks, but don't stay down there for five years trying to draft your entire starting line-up. You'll just end up with a losing culture."
Sam Hinkie didn't pick Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz with their #1 picks. Bryan Colangelo did.  The process wasn't a failure. It was aborted.
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
"Since the second best player on my favorite team is arguably Markelle Fultz, I will take #3 and 6 please."
"Who would you rather have has a point guard?  Shaquille O'Neal or Markelle Fultz?  Position don't matter, so you go for Shaq"
That’s kind of what they said about Markelle fultz.
Is the philly one supposed to be markelle fultz?
"Markelle Fultz had the same hype.   Ben Simmons, the same hype.   Let's see what he does before fantasy booking his career."
His face reminds me too much of Markelle Fultz. I have my doubts on him.
Markelle Fultz is going to make a comeback
Markelle Fultz
"If Markelle Fultz didn't get that freak injury, it could have turned out very differently. Even with the injury, when he came back, a few games in, IIRC there was a game where Fultz, Simmons, and Embiid all played well together."
once he signs a cheap long-term contract to stay in Dallas so they can sign Markelle Fultz they can rest.
Markelle “dude is so handsome” Fultz
I’m really rooting for Markelle Fultz to become a quality NBA player with a long career.
Markelle Fultz   No one could have predicted he'd re-up for [$50 million](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/fultzma01.html#all_contract) after the 76ers unloaded him for a bag of peanuts. Now it looks like they kept the wrong PG.
Markelle Fultz wasn't Markelle Fultz until he became Markelle Fultz
What if Cade is Markelle Fultz though?
"In an ideal world, we would've never traded Markelle Fultz. Also Ben isn't a coward"
Sounds like a certain Markelle Fultz-Jayson Tatum trade.
"Michael Carter Williams, Nerlens Noel, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Evan Turner, Joel Embiid....   God this team's drafting was not great under Hinkie."
"He needs to see a psychologist or something, they can definitely help him handle things differently and improve his mindset. Once his mentality is better and he realises missing some shots isn't the end of the world he'll be good.  And as long as we're comparing players, Markelle Fultz looked decent before getting injured, he was getting memed for pump faking a free throw and was said to be broken.. Wasn't scared to shoot though and that's what I liked about him."
You remember when Markelle Fultz fractured Joel Embiid’s orbital bone sheeeesh
"Lol I had Markelle Fultz and Josh Jackson as the best players from that class, my bad"
He shouldn’t have reclassified. He got thrust into a win-now Duke team instead of going to Arizona State or USC the next year like he was supposed to where he could Ben Simmons/Markelle Fultz his stats.   He would have been supplanted by Zion early as the #1 overall pick but there would be a lot less pressure.
"Yeah like did we really need to pile on Markelle Fultz and Lonzo when they were changing up their shots?   Are we gonna clown Ben Simmons for the next 10 years if he never develops a jumper? I feel like Lamelo was getting clowned like crazy until he had a really good string of games to start the season.   I just think it’s weird who we choose to pile on. Lebron and certain other guys kind of bring it on and are so successful that it’s mostly harmless, but when it’s young guys who’ve done nothing to warrant the vitriol they get, it makes me feel bad."
"trading markelle fultz for romeo langford, and throwing in jayson tatum."
"Ben simmons, markelle fultz"
"We will give you #5, Markelle fultz and mo Bamba. That’s 3! Top 6 picks for just 1 top 1 pick. Pretty generous honestly"
"It’s insane you guys had 5 straight top 6 picks (two #1, two #3 and #6) and took Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz with 4 of them. Embiid was a huge win but man that is a brutal group of 4."
"Yeah but in fairness to the Sixers, their goal wasn't to make the conference Finals, but to get a team talented enough to win the championship. If Markelle Fultz was even an average #1 pick they have a good chance to have been to the Finals and won one (2019 was a great opportunity etc)."
"Let's look at Hinkie's first round draft record:   * 2013: Michael Carter-Williams (11th) - ROY, flipped for another first rounder * 2014: Joel Embiid (franchise player), Dario Saric (starter, part of Jimmy Bulter trade) * 2015: Jahlil Okafor (bust).  * Pre-2016 draft: Hinkie forced out, Colangelo takes over. * 2016 draft, just for context: The Colangelo-led Sixers draft Ben Simmons #1 overall  I only see one lottery whiff on Hinkie's record (Okafor.) So I don't know where you're getting that from.   The Hinkie-accumulated assets were mostly used to 1) trade up for Markelle Fultz in the draft (Colangelo) and 2) to trade for Jimmy Butler and 3) trade for Tobias Harris (both Elton Brand)."
"He’s not as athletic as Zion, for sure, but he’s one of the more talented prospects to come out of college in the last ten years. He’s Ben Simmons if Ben Simmons could shoot 40% from 3. He singlehandedly dragged his team to a 4 seed despite having one of his biggest talents, ball distribution, wasted by teammates that couldn’t shoot or didn’t know where to be. Compare that to top prospects on bad teams like Trae Young (barely got OU to the tournament), Markelle Fultz (9-22 record), Ja Morant (12 seed, though in fairness he was the only one on this list with a definitively worse supporting cast than Cade), and Ben Simmons (didn’t make the tournament). I’ve never seen a freshman dominate the college game like he did without being an athletic freak like Zion or AD."
I still stand by Markelle Fultz. I refuse to give up because I was insanely high on him.
"Detroit's 2 best players last season (Jerami Grant &amp; Saddiqq Bey) are their starting forwards. They had Wayne Ellington starting for a while but Josh Jackson &amp; Hamidou Diallo will likely fight that spot this season.   Like, just like your team has set things up for Markelle Fultz to be ""The Man"", Cunningham will definitely be the lead guard for the Pistons."
"Bill Simmons and Markelle Fultz, what a duo"
Consensus #1 picks in the past include Markelle Fultz. People have short memories.
Everything about Cede and this draft is giving me Markelle Fultz vibes.
Take the best player. Don’t have a Markelle Fultz situation. If they don’t think Cade is the best prospect they should not take him.
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
&gt; Jayson Tatum should not be a top-five pick in 2017 NBA Draft  &gt; Markelle Fultz could be the icing on the Sixers’ cake  &gt; Ben Simmons says he worked on his shot while out for the year  Wow just wow
"and also I’m not trying to make it seem like Dejounte is some amazing player that is a true championship quality point guard, idk if that’s true, but at the start of the playoffs is was agreed that the Sixers had a cakewalk to the conference finals and I think that if they had pretty much any other starting point guard in the league(outside of a few) over this version of Ben Simmons who did not attempt a field goal in the 4th quarter and averaged like 11 ppg they could beat an 8th seed and 5th seed as the 1st seed. Dejounte on this team would have Philly in the ecf, so would like Malcolm Brogdan, Kyle Lowry, Collin Sexton, either Ball brother, man maybe even healthy Markelle Fultz or half healthy Kemba Walker idk Ben Simmons was just that bad"
In 2015 the Kings agreed to a 2017 pick swap with the 76ers as part of a salary dump. That year the Kings won the 3rd pick in the lottery and the Sixers got the 5th and executed the pick swap. They then traded that 3rd pick to Boston in a package for the 1st and took Markelle Fultz.  Without the pick swap who knows if they can get the deal done with Boston (Boston probably wouldn't go later than 3 because they were set on Tatum). They stay pat at 5 and potentially end up with De'Aaron Fox instead of Fultz
Scoring 20+ isn't nearly as common in college as it is in the NBA. Here are some recent Freshmen #1 picks and the number of times they scored 20+  Greg Oden: 5  Derrick Rose: 9  John Wall: 8  Kyrie Irving: 3 (only played 11 games)  Anthony Davis: 6  Anthony Bennett: 13  Andrew Wiggins: 11  KAT: 2  Ben Simmons: 18  Markelle Fultz: 18  Deandre Ayton: 17  Zion Williamson: 23  Anthony Edwards: 13
Markelle Fultz didn’t get Washington in either.
"I’d imagine they’d be in a better place. There’s a misconception that Hinkie only wanted to tear down his roster, but he was doing things like hiring assistant coaches and support staffers that had connections to big free agents starting with Kevin Durant in that 2016 class. That’s not to say Hinkie would have signed KD, but I’m pretty confident he wouldn’t have mortgaged a future first round pick to trade up for Markelle Fultz, and I imagine he would have been able to more organically add around this Embiid-Simmons core."
He needs Markelle Fultz therapist lol.
Bring in Markelle Fultz as the shooting coach.
"What makes you think he refuses to work on his game?  You don't know that.  I think he has a mental problem right now and might really be trying his hardest to overcome it.  And saying a teammate is wasting someone's prime is ridiculous. No one owes Embiid anything.  Plus he's hurt all the time.  Maybe Ben Simmons' prime is being wasted by a slow, out of shape and injured Embiid  who gave up 3 full court easy dunks in the 4th quarter and let Collins and Capela slip by him for 3 offensive rebounds late in the game. Plus they've had two bad coaches in a row.  Maybe those coaches are wasting Ben's prime.  Plus they drafted Markelle Fultz, Nerlens Noel, and Jalhil Okafor.  Maybe the GMs wasted their prime. Quit blaming other people for your misery."
"It’s possible. But I also think it’s possible Philly has just not handled this well. Look at Markelle Fultz. Philly failed to help him with his shot when he was struggling. With the Magic, he has improved a lot.   Idk if the issue is as much that Ben Simmons is being prideful and arrogant. I think he has a mental block that is preventing him from taking those shots. And spending an entire offseason working on shooting, comes with the expectation that he will take and make more jump shots. Of course, I’m just speculating and don’t actually know."
"Gonna do to Ben what they did to Markelle Fultz shooting but this time, from single digit scoring to 0 lol"
Please tell me you aren't comparing Markelle Fultz (who I love and want to succeed) to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.
Markelle Fultz   Zhaire Smith  Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons   Jahlil Okafor
right? even markelle fultz got a first round pick in return
he is talking about the sixers with ben simmons and markelle Fultz
"Off the top of my head, Dante Exum, Markelle Fultz, Justise Winslow, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina"
"It’s a big reason I strongly disagree with Markelle Fultz being on this list, especially since he’s actually a good player as part of a young core on a team."
"Markelle Fultz is not a bust. Dude is an above average player in the league right now. The only reason people don’t know that is because he plays in Orlando, and most people stopped paying attention to him after he got traded.  Josh Jackson(sort of) and DSJ are the two busts from that draft. You could argue Frank Ntilikina too, just because he’s still unplayable in some matchups due to spacing problems."
come on man Markelle Fultz isn't a bust. He nice with it tho
"Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barbershop. Markelle Fultz can’t shoot 3s, Markelle Fultz fucked his free throw. My boy weak, he got the yips or something. He, he say that boy ain’t been putting in work. SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y’all don’t know shit! All ya motherfuckers talk about Fultz ain’t no hitter, Fultz a bust, Fultz a fake SHUT THE FUCK UP! Y’all don’t live with that boy! You know that boy got shout-out from KD, shooting hesi pull ups and shit. Kelle been pullin up since fucking.... I don’t know when. Motherfuckers stop fucking playin him like that. Them boys ballin out here. If I catch another Tatum or Big Baller Ass Laker motherfucker talking sweet about ‘Kelle I’m beating they fucking ass! I’m not fucking playing no more, you know those boys roll with Ben Simmons and them!"

"Evan Turner, Maurice Harkless, MCW, Elfrid Payton, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz  That one time they drafted Mikael Bridges but opted to trade him for Zhaire Smith.. idk how much of who overruling who at that time but the scoutings were def into Zhaire Smith enough to convince acting GM Brett Brown to pull that trade"
"Magic gotta go with Markelle Fultz,  Spurs gotta go with Lonnie Skywalker"
Markelle fultz 23? Who is he... being a young socialite with?
People still that interested in markelle Fultz huh
"The surprise of the list has to be Markelle Fultz at 19. I know he was pretty popular through HS and College, but that's still way more than I was expecting."
Maybe their situation would have been different if their GM wasn’t replaced in the middle of the Process.   You mentioned Nerlens Noel. Colangelo traded away a 22 year old Nerlens Noel for Andrew Bogut and Justin Anderson. Four days later they waived Bogut.   Colangelo also traded up to pick Markelle Fultz  Who knows what would have happened if they didn’t cut their tank short?
How could anyone say he's boring? He's like if Markelle Fultz was a (much much better) 7 footer.  He's so sporadic and non-conventional it makes him very exciting.  The style of play is just different.

"Markelle Fultz is a better shooter than Culver - let that sink in. 40/28/50 shooting splits. And as bad as he is offensively, his defense was possibly worse."
"If we got the as-seen-on-tv version of Markelle Fultz from college we wouldn't even be in this situation. He was going to be the perfect fit next to Simmons, someone who can play on and off ball, run the pick and roll, distribute, create for himself on the perimeter.  Then he just stopped shooting and couldn't make free throws. And now he's on the Magic and everyone says he could be in their starting lineup moving forward. And they're pretty stacked in the back court.  Pain."
"Tyrese Haliburton  Wendell Carter Jr.  Deni Avidja  As a Celtics fan... Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford and Payton Pritchard  I still believe in Markelle Fultz... he won't ever be a superstar in the strictest sense of the word or the best player in his draft class but he has a Jrue Holiday type ceiling  Jamal Murray I think his ceiling is a lot higher than probably most people think. I wanted the Celtics to draft him 3rd in his draft"
"Pretty sure Markelle Fultz did [well in college](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2695333-markelle-fultz-is-the-big-man-on-campus-20-inside-the-making-of-a-superstar.amp.html).  If you were referring to Brick Simmons, he was drafted the year before but sat due to injuries."
Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz. Imagine having both on the same team.
Markelle Fultz is really cute. That's my contribution here.
&gt;Have there been other players that had mental hangups similar to Simmons?  Some people believe that Markelle Fultz had mental hangups aka “the yips”
"Ig this doesn't fit your extra criteria, but it does fit the title.  Ben Simmons. Never seen this sub shit on anyone as much as they have Ben. Worse than I ever saw it for Paul George last year, and far more unanimous than with hated guys like Russ, Harden, or KD. Yet the dude is an absolute freak athlete, one of the best passers in the league, one of the best defensive players in the league, etc. Wiggins turned his career around, I think Simmons will too.  Also, Markelle Fultz."
Markelle Fultz has all the tools man he just can't shoot.  So maybe if his shot returns he's a really elite player.
Markelle Fultz lol
I’m not afraid to say it but I still believe I’m markelle fultz and think people I just to hard on young kids coming into the league who only want to live out their dreams on being in the nba
"Pretty comical to see guys like Darius Garland, Markelle Fultz, Devin Vassell and Okeke with more upvotes than Tyrese. I guess as a Kings fan I’ve seen so much of him and know how much better he is than those guys that it didn’t occur to me the league really doesn’t know how good he will be yet."
"call me delusional, but i still truly believe that markelle fultz will break out and make an all-star game within the next few years"
Markelle Fultz
bruh markelle fultz

Markelle Fultz.  I know it’s possible he got injured but it still remains pretty unclear how?  Kevin Knox had a lot of hype coming out of the draft but has been… not good.
"Gonna mention a name I haven't seen yet - Markelle Fultz.   There's a reason the Magic gave him the contract they did, and he was the key to starting the 20/21 season as one of the top 3 or 4 teams in the league (until his injury). He's still thought of as a complete bust by 90% of casuals, and even those who pay attention to the league don't focus on Fultz at all because it's the Magic (don't blame em lol).  Shot 89.5% from the line last season, and was becoming more and more confident with his three. ACL tear couldn't have happened to a worse player"
"Taurean prince, Denzel valentine, Markelle fultz, lauri markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, marvin bagley, Kevin knox. That's my list of guys that were hyped but either have had bad injury luck or don't know what the hell is going on."
Markelle Fultz isn’t a role player in Orlando. He’s arguably their best player.
Markelle Fultz injured his shoulder in a motor bike accident
Markelle Fultz
The fact that we traded Marcelle Fultz bum ass for Maxey (who plays exactly how Markelle was supposed to play out of college) is the one thing keeping going as a sixers fan
"Bluntly, would the Warriors have given him a max contract ?  Being part of The Process earned him around $200 million dollars, because after their several failed picks  - Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor - Philly were desperate enough to lock down one of their semi-successes to a long term deal."
"Markelle Fultz, Josh Jackson, and Jonathan Issac were all picked before Ntilikina. If it was so obvious that Mitchell was going to be good, how did 12 teams miss it? Take away the Celtics if you want because they got Tatum."
Jayson Tatum &gt; Markelle Fultz
"I posted a thread earlier where I looked at the stat splits and found that Ben shoots significantly fewer free throws and at a lower percentage in front of the Sixers crowd. Given that Markelle Fultz also got the yips playing for the Sixers, this may indicate something about the fans being too abusive to guys who are having difficulties with their shot."
markelle fultz didnt have a motorcycle accidence ^^/s
Non-AMP version: https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/markelle-fultz-instagram
I’m not saying JJJ wasn’t a reasonable pick at the time. Like Markelle Fultz was a reasonable pick for #1 at the time and was a no brainer but nobody is saying that the sixers NAILED that pick by picking fultz over tatum. Same thing applies here. I’m not bad mouthing the FO or anything. I’m just saying they didn’t nail that draft
Markelle Fultz
https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/markelle-fultz-instagram/amp
"Friendship ended with Darrell Armstrong, Penny Hardaway, Jameer Nelson, Rafer Alston, Elfrid Payton lol, DJ Augustin, Markelle Fultz and the black hole Cole Anthony.  New best friend is Jalen Suggs"
Markelle Fultz: I see nothing wrong with this
These are the last 17 years of #1 overall picks:  Cade Cunningham  Anthony Edwards  Zion Williamson  DeAndre Ayton  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Karl-Anthony Towns  Andrew Wiggins  Anthony Bennett  Anthony Davis  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Blake Griffin  Derrick Rose  Greg Oden  Andrea Bargnani  Andrew Bogut  I think you take Jaylen Brown over all but 4 of those players. When you draft #1 you hope to get someone as good as Jaylen Brown when they are his age. Number 1 picks are nowhere near surefire.  You should be nowhere near expecting a #1 option on a championship team player with your #1 overall pick. Literally none of the people on this list have done that.
"I was at that game. It felt like a special night. Last game of the regular season, Eagles had won the SB (Dougie P came out with the Lombardi), on a good run going into the playoffs, and nothing but positive vibes for Markelle.   Didn’t end well but it was a fun thing to witness and I’m glad I was able to go. My first Sixers home game. Hope Fultz gets to shine in Orlando."
It’s not talked about enough just how putrid Jrue Holiday was on the offensive end last postseason. I get that his defence was great and winning cures all but a 48.2 TS% is legit Markelle Fultz numbers.
"Bruh you just called him Markelle Fultz lol, if you're gonna try to call him a bust at least be consistent with your bad takes"
Im getting Markelle Fultz vibes from Cade.
"I don’t know if it’s the length of the shorts, or his game, or both but he reminds me of Markelle Fultz. Good Markelle Fultz."
Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz will make an All-Star team one day
"a lot of people are gonna hate on this list but you're right OP. Hinkie didn't get every pick right but he played the flawed nba lottery system as well as anyone ever has by maximizing value. People get mad at the strategy and doubt he was really a great GM but anyone who really knows and paid attention to how things played out understands Hinkie was a visionary. Imagine if markelle fultz never forgets how to play basketball for example, we'd all be reading books about how the process changed basketball because the 76ers would likely have a title or two. Even if that choice of pick had nothing to do with him. People judge things based on the result far too often, especially narrow minded sports fans like us.    Hell look at how much we praise Sam Presti who is following this same blueprint."
He's gonna be like the 160th highest paid player next year. He's making half of what Markelle Fultz is making. He's gonna be like the 7th highest paid Knick. Even if he plays 20 games an opts out it was still work it.
Markelle Fultz
"Woj literally reported the deal was Ingram a first and loul deng (a negative asset who we’d have to take back as a salary filler). Spurs wanted more and the Lakers said no. Sure you can argue that in hindsight Ingram and a first is a good deal, but DeRozan, Poeltl and a first was an even better deal at that time.    Kawhi had no value because he tanked it. The other offers the Spurs had were from the Celtics who didn’t offer sophomore Brown or rookie Tatum. The sixers who wouldn’t even offer Markelle fultz, the Heat whose “god father” offer was centered around Hassan whiteside and Josh Richardson, and the Clippers whose deal was an expiring Tobias Harris and a lottery pick.  Kawhi was out the previous year with a quad and knee injury his team tried to debunk, was on an expiring deal, and had a camp that threatened teams with the possibility of him sitting out another year, and made it known he was going to go to Los Angeles which lead to no teams wanting to give up anything of value."
If this is a real comment from Simmons than lol. Learn how to shoot a free throw (or anything outside of the charge circle) you worthless chode. Markelle Fultz is a better shooter than you. The fact that you think any of those “bad situations” would want you to begin with is some funny shit. “Yea let’s get that oversized PG who couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn and is a scared little squirrel in the 4Q.
"In a return to the court, Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz collide and suffer a rare double acl injury.   Using the injured player exception, the Magic sign former assists leader Shelving Mack and local legend Tacko Fall  (Ok the last part would be fine, I was just thinking about the longest player available)"
"I think KD isn't some miracle case like everyone thinks. I think sports science is rapidly improving to the point where players can come back from injuries far better than ever before. Think about Dwight Howard's back, d-rose's knees, kawhi's leg, whatever weird thing Markelle Fultz had. There's a lot more treatment available now and it's only getting better every year."
"Philadelphia really has the worst luck with high draft picks. Carson Wentz, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons.."
I wanna see a Cole Anthony - Markelle Fultz - Jalen Suggs backcourt exceed expectations this year. I have high hopes for all three and if Jonathan Isaac can stay healthy y'all will be fun at the very least. So many fast breaks if they buy in on defense.
"can go smaller and use Prince George County, Maryland; population 900k  KD, Oladipo, Markelle Fultz, Michael Beasley, Ty Lawson, Jeff Green, Quinn Cook, Jerami Grant, Roy Hibbert, Thomas Robinson, Jarrett Jack.  They could probably give Slovenia a run"
"You think that's bad, let me tell you about Jahlil Okafor and Markelle Fultz.."
I could make an argument that Markelle Fultz ruined the process
No that's markelle fultz
"Compared to George Hill's corpse, Raul Neto, the Markelle Fultz experience. It can't be overstated how down bad we are here"
Hey we drafted Suggs and all you hear are which point guard is getting moved.  Markelle Fultz or Cole Anthony.
"Crazy seeing it like this, 4 consecutive Top 3 picks, and two #10s.   You only looked at a few instances, but I would imagine that nets you 2 future All-Stars, and/or potentially one top tier all-time player like LBJ, Tim Duncan, or Shaq, who've been mentioned in the thread.   Number ones around the Sixers are Zion, KAT, AD, Kyrie, and Rose. Better than Ben Simmons? Maybe/maybe not. Better than Markelle Fultz? Definitely.   [Historically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks) there's about 2 picks a decade that are NOT All-Star caliber or better, and the Sixers got one of them."

"I mean it can go either way. Markelle Fultz had an awful workout with the Celtics, they already liked Tatum, who had a great workout, and knew Magic liked Lonzo so they decided to trade down and take Tatum."
"Don't you like Guard rotation of Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Markelle Fultz, and Jalen Suggs?"
"Bryan Colangelo was the 76ers GM and was talking shit about Embiid, Fultz and others while praising himself on twitter through burners. Then someone put the pieces together and he got caught.   https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz"
"&gt;Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order.     I call bullshit here. Fultz 1, Lonzo 2 and Tatum 3 was locked the fuck in a month before the draft."
That’s fair for Jaylen but for 2017 everyone and their mom had Markelle Fultz going number one. Passing up on a consensus number one pick is bat shit crazy but Danny nailed it. Hell there was a consensus number one and two and Tatum was neither.
"some people on this sub actually try to act like Markelle Fultz wasn't the consensus top pick but he absolutely was. It was only a few years ago and they already forgot.  Tatum at 3 was considered a bit of a reach at the time too, a lot of mock drafts had him in the 4-6 range. Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order."
"&gt; [Ebony Fultz] took more control of Fultz’s schedule and finances. She’d argue with Markelle, whom she continued to view as her baby boy despite him now being a multimillion-dollar brand. They’d fight over cleaning out storage boxes in the family home. **She’d call him dozens of times a day**. One day, after a particularly trying fight with Ebony over his desire to purchase a new car, Fultz met Williams at the gym. “He shot the ball worse than he had in weeks,” said an onlooker.  &gt; Around September, Fultz moved into a house in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. “That’s where everything went south,” a friend said. Ebony got an apartment downtown but **felt like she needed to exert even more control.**  &gt; She’d become annoyed if Markelle had girls over at night. **She installed security cameras around his home.** She’d often eavesdrop and sometimes even call to scold Markelle about comments she’d heard.  &gt; A couple weeks after they moved in, Ebony printed dozens of flyers for Tappin to put in their neighbors’ mailboxes, asking them to stop bothering her son. Tappin only distributed them to families that he thought had kids, which led to a fight, which led to her offering Markelle an ultimatum: Tappin or her. Tappin, knowing Fultz had no choice, moved out. That night, Ebony and Williams met Markelle at his home. Before long, Markelle and Ebony were yelling at each other. **Crying, Markelle ran out of the house and into the street**, barely avoiding a streaking car. Williams chased after him.  &gt; **”The money did all this,” Markelle, tears streaking down his face, sniveled to Williams. “I don’t want this no more. You should have left me in college.”**  &gt; Living in a new city by himself with Tappin gone and Williams pushed to the side left him with few places to turn. He’d found some solace in Embiid’s apartment, playing the card game Exploding Kittens and watching NBA games and highlights, but **an argument between Ebony and some people in Embiid’s circle had strained that relationship**.  TLDR: She’s overprotective af and apparently Fultz didn’t wanna play in Philly because of how close it was to his mom"
"For what it's worth, Markelle Fultz apparently shot dreadfully at his pre-draft workouts. The Sixers FO seemed to downplay the importance of one workout compared to hours of tape and took Fultz #1 anyway.    Not saying that's what happened with Suggs, but it does show that it might not be crazy to change your evaluation based on a bad workout."
It was Markelle fultz level bad. Worst shooter they saw in the 1-on-0 draft process (they looked at around 10 of the lotto guys)
&gt; They might just be better at picking guys they think will continue to make significant improvements.    Like even the players themselves say it's Coach Pop and The Spurs personal. Guys like Derrick White don't go from being a senior at colorado to developing and ultimately being better than guys like Markelle Fultz or Dennis Smith Jr. because the Spurs guessed it
"The league was unhappy with Sam Hinkie running the Sixers in the ""Trust the Process"" era, so they leaned on the Sixers to hire Jerry Colangelo as a consultant. Jerry installed his son Bryan over the top of Sam Hinkie, effectively demoting Sam without technically demoting him. Hinkie resigned. [Bryan Colangelo](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz) went on to do a bunch of short term trades as well as apparently making fake Twitter accounts to tweet about his own players and defend himself."

I refuse to give up on Markelle Fultz because I was so high on him going into the draft.
Preview of the rest of the lakers target list for this summer:  Markelle Fultz   Bismack biyombo  Dwight Howard  Elfrid payton  Josh jackson  Tony Allen  Ricky rubio
"Fultz is still recovering from an ACL injury and I doubt we move him while he recovers unless we get a crazy offer. Which I doubt. Let’s see how Suggs, Anthony and Hampton fit in the meantime and then figure everything out when Markelle is healthy. Someone has to end up traded eventually as we identify the best of the bunch and the player(s) to build around but I see no reason to rush Fultz out the door while he is injured tbh.   Terrence Ross and Gary Harris are the ones likely to be dealt this offseason. Ross has more value but Harris is on the last year of his deal and is better off as a role player on a contending team."
"Boston trades: Markelle Fultz  Boston receives: Jayson Tatum, Romeo Langford and Markelle Fultz"
I’ll take one Markelle Fultz please
"Orlando Magic another big winner so far with their young rotation:  **PG:** Jalen Suggs, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony.   **SG:** RJ Hampton.  **SF:** Franz Wagner.  **PF:** Chuma Okeke.   **C:** Wendell Carter Jr, Mo Bamba.   Got some fairly moveable guys too with Harris and Ross."
Don't forget Markelle Fultz too
Hell Jalen Suggs is gonna make Orlando fans forget about Markelle Fultz
Markelle Fultz Cole Anthony and RJ Hampton stans in shambles
RIP Markelle Fultz
markelle fultz in shamble
Markelle fultz told Tmac that he expected to win MVP his rookie year lol
"Markelle fultz averaging just 11pts, 3reb, 4ast and Lonzo Averaging 12 pts, 6reb, 6ast. Fultz not really improved but lonzo has improved his stats in Pelicans"
There's also people who believed Markelle Fultz was worthy of being the #1 pick. Go figure.
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
MVP: Luka  DPOY: Ben Simmons  ROY: Jalen Suggs  MIP: Markelle Fultz
"Not that great. You had [this guy](http://upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26121351/Markelle-Fultz-.jpg) overdo it, and he became shot-less.   And I dont buy the nerve damage story (he went to 20+ doctors so one could give him that diagnose). He fucked up his shot by bulking + that motorcycle accident + mental issues."
MIP Markelle Fultz
im at the point now where i think there are forces holding the sixers back that go beyond personnel and management. all i'll say is this:  Ben Simmons: Nike  Markelle Fultz: Nike  Joel Embiid: UA
They should trade him for Markelle Fultz.
"we shit on him every chance we got? you're literally fucking delusional  we've supported this dude and his non shooting for years, go watch the clips of us cheering him for making a free throw after missing 5 in a row  its the same shit as markelle fultz, we supported that guy non stop with cheering even with the hitch"
Lot of coincidental weak minds in Philly eh? Markelle Fultz comes to mind. Maybe it's the culture? Just saying.
We had an arena erupt over him simply making a 3 lol this take is terrible and so is Markelle fultz.
You guys were really supportive of Markelle Fultz too....
"Well instead they drafted Michael Carter-Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, and Ben Simmons  and went 1-23 to start the season. Stop the “the process was shutdown” nonsense   The process was a clown show, and a failure"
Markelle Fultz if he can shape himself into Allstar level
"Changing shooting form is something very few people can actually do. It's a unique case, but look at Markelle Fultz.  Once something is baked into your muscle memory, it's almost impossible to make small adjustments and stay consistent. It has been done though."
Markelle Fultz
"His value is tied to what he's done, and he's collapsed in big moments. Will there be another big moment on the 76ers before he's traded?   Roy Hibbert had a ton of value as DPOY candidate, then was out of the league in 2 years.   Victor Oladipo was All-NBA just a couple years ago, and just signed to a minimum.   Markelle Fultz was a #1 pick and 2 years later traded for a bench piece plus a highly protected pick.   You can say all GMs have goldfish memories, or recognize that as the information changes the perceptions change."
"Fuck Andrew Bynum, fuck Jared Dudley, fuck Marcus Smart and fuck Markelle Fultz.   But most of all, fuck Ben Simmons."
"Sure, a person's WARP in one season doesn't predict whether they're going to demand a trade and deliberately get benched or play terribly the next season, which can and has happened and would get you in trouble if you relied totally on that and not, say, who might be sick of their franchise and suddenly want to go to the Nets or Lakers.  It's fundamental to how this whole process works. A person having a high PER or WARP isn't what causes the basketball to go in the hoop. Physical processes, decisions and interactions do and you then find the number afterward.   So while looking backward from a high PER means that likely the physical processes and decisions are there that would cause the ball to go in the hoop for their team (and not for the other team) more often when they're on the floor, which would cause the player's PER to be high, those physical processes can change in ways that PER won't reflect, like Markelle Fultz injuring his shoulder or Vince Carter, James Harden or Anthony Davis getting into a feud with their teams.  Since we don't have concrete ways to reflect those physical things, the correlations, as they always do, will be good most of the time and miss massively some of the time. Which is a minefield when it comes to relying on the models."
"It's fundamental to how this whole process works. A person having a 30 PER isn't what causes the basketball to go in the hoop. Physical processes, decisions and interactions do.

"That's a really good outcome for a #1 pick in an average draft.  You would be pleased if your #1 overall turned out to be a low level all-star player.  Take a look at the last 10 #1 overall picks, and Ben is clearly in the top range.  2010 - John Wall  2011 - Kyrie Irving  2012 - Anthony Davis  2013 - Anthony Bennett  2014 - Andrew Wiggins  2015 - KAT  2016 - Ben Simmons  2017 - Markelle Fultz  2018 - Deandre Ayton  2019 - Zion  Ben would be top 3 or 4 on that list, only Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving I would say are clear cut better than Ben Simmons, and both of those guys have serious injury concerns"
List of vet point guards in the NBA who will probably play a fair amount but probably won't be as good as John Wall this season: (Add your own)  1. Ish Smith 2. Victor Oladipo? 3. Brad Wanamaker 4. Elfrid Payton 5. Ricky Rubio? 6. Tyus Jones? 7. Markelle Fultz 8. Dennis Smith Jr. 9. Michael Carter-Williams 10. Kris Dunn 11. Aaron Holiday
"&gt; Even 1st overall picks aren’t guaranteed tbh.  They aren't *guaranteed* to succeed, but there is such a huge difference between #1 and #2. #1 picks average almost as many win shares as the #2 and #3 combined. Occasionally you get an Anthony Bennett but #1 has a very high likelihood of success.  Since 2000, the #1 pick has been an all star every time except 9 (so 57% all stars) and that's including Ayton who probably *will* be an all star and Anthony Edwards who it's a little too early to tell, but I still included all of them except Cunningham (ie, all of them who have actually played).  Of those 9 who didn't make an all-star game, I would argue there are only 3 true busts.  Kwame Brown: Bust  Anthony Bennett: Bust  Andrea Bargniani: Bust  Andrew Bogut: Still had a good career  Greg Oden: Injuries. If you want to call him a bust you can, but to me it's a little different if the guy's career is derailed by something like that versus just not being a good player.  Markelle Fultz: Injuries  Andrew Wiggins: Still a decent-ish player  DeAndre Ayton: Too early to say but *probably* not a bust. Seems really good actually.  Anthony Edwards: Too early to say"
"Simmons act has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.  A lot of fans, myself included, sometimes can't divorce how they feel about a player from how good they think they are.  He went from a disaster of a playoff series to telling the world he only wants to play in LA because he's Marie Antoinette.  I think the average fan thinks he's a 6'11"" Markelle Fultz or something. A complete flyer.  It's not true, but I get it"
He might have been hanging out with Markelle Fultz when he was still at Philly
Markelle Fultz
This the same man that thinks Markelle fultz has allstar potential... why haven't we hired him yet 😂😂😂
"Kind of not answering the question, but I feel like there is simply no way to know how good guys will be in the NBA. Guys like Wiggins, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz were supposed to be LeBron-level prospects but so far have fallen well short of that."
"I was high on DSJ and Markelle Fultz before..you know.   There was Jabari Parker who I predicted would be the next Carmelo Anthony. I also had Kidd Gilchrist, who I personally thought was gonna be a star.   Mario Hezonja is another...the hype was real back then."
"&gt; Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  Ice cold, offensive to a broad spectrum of people and topical. Love it. 10/10."
"Magic Johnson got nicknamed ""Tragic"" after a bad playoff run in the early 80's.  Markelle Fultz got nicknamed ""MH370"" because his game disappeared and no one knew why.  The Brooklyn Nets called the Brooklyn Nuts after we got Kyrie.  Kristaps Porzingis, ""The Trebuchet"" because he's 100-feet tall and launches slow shots from a mile away.  Zion Williamson ""Snorlax.""  Kawhi Leonard was ""Wi-Fi"" because he was amazing but he would cut out on you whenever he felt like it.  Someone called Lamelo Ball ""LMAO Ball"" when he looked like he might bust but Lamelo escaped that fate.  The Lakers were the Los Angeles Flakers after the 2004 loss.  Andrew Wiggins was ""Adrian"" because despite being 6'8"" with a 44"" vertical his most famous Youtube clip was a prankster asking him if he was Asian and he thought the guy said Adrian."
"His doctors literally diagnosed him with [thoracic outlet syndrome](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/12/13/18134738/markelle-fultz-injury-tos-thoratic-outlet-syndrome-doctor)??  The Orlando Magic medical staff confirmed that diagnosis??  He's been getting physical therapy for that condition for 2 years??  Genuinely, what are you on about..."
"""hater""  It's not ""hate"", it's just the facts lol  Dude has shot 38.6% from the field and 29.2% from three over the past 5 years in the playoffs  Those are Markelle Fultz numbers"
"The team with 3 Hall of Famers on it.  Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and Jalen Suggs."
"He was the top prospect for his class for a while, but then hit a snag with back to back injuries.  I just looked his HS class and it looks like a bunch of people in his class had lackluster careers.   1 - Josh Jackson  2 - Harry Giles  3 - Lonzo Ball  4 - Jayson Tayum  (obviously good)    5 - Markelle Fultz"
"Keep sleeping 😴 doubt he ever makes an allstar team, but with his skillset assuming he stays healthy I think he can be a high level starting combo guard and I love the fit with him next to Suggs despite neither projecting to be true point guards.   Aside from the whole unable to make 3s and weird free throw stuff (that he’s actually gotten better at) Markelle fultz has a lot of talent especially on offense. When watching him his athleticism, pace he plays at, ability to change speeds, ball handling/control, ability to get to rim, ability to finish at the rim at a very high level, pull up game, in-between game and passing IQ make his offensive game more complete than people seem to think. His few main downsides on that end are his FTr, FT%, 3 pointer (which will all skew his TS% for his career assuming they all stay stagnant) and he also needs to become a better PnR player.   Outside of that I’m not sure what else to say. I’m not too worried about the torn ACL I’ve seen young athletic guards like Zach Lavine and Dejounte Murray tear it and come back not only the same player but better and I think the same will happen with Markelle. I don’t expect him to play amazing this upcoming season just due to the fact that he is coming off an injury but once he’s 100% in 2022-2023 I think he’ll see the emergence of Markelle Fultz."
"you are correct.  draymond green has scorers that deflect from his inability to shoot, and the many many times he's passed up layups to kick it out for 3pt shots.  the sixers drafted markelle fultz, then they traded for jimmy butler.  they lost both, so the focus is unreasonably on ben simmons' shooting.  as if being one of the top 3 defenders in the league who also creates the most 3pt shots for his teammates is something to be embarassed about, or something that can't be incorporated in a winning program.  says a lot about the critic's lack of basketball knowledge than about ben simmons.  but none of that matters.  the environment is toxic, sixers fans have contributed to it, and they will reap what has been sown by losing a very good player for a bunch of lesser ones in trade."
"To put into context for others who think Bam is old, he was in the 2017 draft class which included; Markelle Fultz, Lonzo, Jayson Tatum, De'aaron, Jarret Allen, Kuzma, Josh Hart, Lauri Markkanen, and Frank Nilikina."
"Nah bro, Orlando's three point shooting was absurd that series. Markelle Fultz still shoots 75% from three, Fox can't stop that."
Markelle Fultz
lol ay if leaving Philly fixed **Markelle Fultz'** jumper then I fully expect Simmons to become an MVP candidate once he gets outta there.
"What you are saying is true.  However, the Sixers know this as well and have been trying to draft a chucker to take over in the 4th like Jimmy Butler did three years ago.  It's so important, the Sixers traded up to #1 for Markelle Fultz.  But going back to your point about leverage, Morey and Sixers fans are or should be justifiably excited about Tyrese Maxey filling that role, I think.  Maxey is as much of a hit as Matisse Thybulle.  The sky is not falling."
"Back when Markelle fultz was a rookie and still with the sixers, people were trying to push the nickname The FEDS (Fultz, Embiid, Dario Saric, Simmons)"
"Maybe he was thinking about jump shots in HS. Ben took a ton of jump shots in high school and his free throw percentage was better than the NBA average. Philly has been a toxic organization since Hinkie was fired, and was the worst possible fit for Ben. If Simmons lands on the right team, specifically Portland with Dame’s leadership, he’s going be a completely different player. Even Markelle Fultz was looking very good once he was out of there."
"Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Carson Wentz, Nelson Agholor…highly touted picks mentally fracturing for a variety of reasons is not a unique occurrence to Philly sports.  Rivers publicly questioned Ben’s potential with a response that didn’t even need to be made (“I don’t know” when asked if Ben is a championship PG). That’s why I referenced him.  Yes, Ben’s super soft, but you can’t act surprised when calling out a sensitive player doesn’t go “well”. Doesn’t mean you pander to them, but not necessarily going public with doubt."
"Also imagine if they didn't use the #1 pick (and future picks) drafting Markelle Fultz. Could have gotten Tatum, Mitchell, Adebayo...would have been gamechanging."
The guy was more polished and efficient of a scorer than Beal coming out of college with comparable athleticism. It was a no brainer pick to this day. Whatever happened to Markelle Fultz between his last game at Washington and arriving in Philadelphia is one of sports greatest mysteries.
imagine if markelle fultz never got into a motorcycle accident and got nerve damage and didn't have a fucked up family
"We sent Markelle Fultz a fruit basket, man. We cheered like they won the championship when they made a three or even worse, a free throw. But no one wants to talk about that. Just that Philly fans are “toxic”"
Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome  https://www.businessinsider.com/markelle-fultz-neurogenic-thoracic-outlet-syndrome-2018-12  And a bit more about the syndrome itself in relation to Fultz   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/12/13/18134738/markelle-fultz-injury-tos-thoratic-outlet-syndrome-doctor
I think its pretty clear he injured his shoulder doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing. My bet is x/moto x but a lifting accident wouldn't suprise me either.    Just look at the facts:   markelles jumper looks absolutely butter in SL&gt;Markelle goes to visit all his friends who love bikes&gt;Markelle comes back to philly 2 weeks later with an unexplainable shoulder injury and an inability to lift his arms above his head&gt;Markelle fultz mother installs security cameras in his home to make sure he doesn't do anything else stupid&gt;fultz mom goes off on hanlen for suggesting he was still injured going into his sophomore season  I think the dude got injured doing something he shouldn't have been doing and had to keep quiet/sit out in order to continue securing the bag
And the Sixers medical staff doesnt exactly have a good track record recently. I am way more inclined to believe that they grossly misdiagnosed a rare basketball injury than Markelle Fultz having a complete mental breakdown.
"Markelle Fultz and Ben Simmons were seen as the clear number 1 selections. Idk why you expect Hinkie to do something different, when he really hasn't shown any ability to draft outside of Joel Embiid."
"It's funny that everyone is saying he's never cleared it up, because he's explained it so many times since coming to Orlando on podcasts and interviews.   He has [thoracic outlet syndrome](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/12/13/18134738/markelle-fultz-injury-tos-thoratic-outlet-syndrome-doctor) and the nerves in his shoulder were messed up. His shot got fucked up because instead of therapy he tried to push through (probably due to pressure from Philly fans and the Sixers) and his shot changed to try and compensate for his shoulder, when what he needed was therapy to address the issue - his shoulder basically went undiagnosed until the end of his Philly tenure.  His shoulder has been much better since coming to Orlando and according to Markelle it feels pretty much normal, he just needs to continue to rebuild muscle memory. Although his shot isn't all the way back it's much more fluid than it used to be, and he's become a decent FT shooter at 73% in 19-20 and 89.5% in 20-21 (obviously a small sample, but 17/19 from FT is pretty good). He's also money from mid-range.  His 3PT still looks a bit janky [but it's not *that* bad](https://www.the-high-low.com/?ids=205Syc20cXUM20yDrh20JwTM20swoj20fmfQ20ViFS209OII20lnxG20Nx3A20tYnI20u6IN205QPW208ofE20s75V207FeQ), people are just hyper focused on his form. His release point is lower than it was in college, and it's a bit slow and his form can be inconsistent, but it's hardly the worst shot in the league, and he's basically had to rebuild his shot and muscle memory from scratch. He's had good stretches - he shot 36.4% from 3 on 33 attempts in the Bubble across 13 games, and he's not afraid to shoot if people go under the screen, which is encouraging for his future development."
Even Markelle Fultz thinks Ben Simmons is a weak-minded bitch.
"Markelle Fultz. Even tho I am a celtics fan and Fultz was drafted by sixers, I think he has way too much talent to average 10 points per game"
Markelle Fultz?
Markelle Fultz
"I think a lot of outside fans were skeptical of your roster construction even before that. Drafting Embiid, Okafor, Nerlens Noel, and Simmons was really questionable. Colangelo is such a dipshit. I didn't see how having 4 giant non-shooters would work. Embiid surprised everyone when he became a 3 point shooter, but the other three worked out as expected.   The Markelle Fultz thing really fucked you because he was actually supposed to be a decent shooter. So did the Zhaire Smith sesame oil thing. So not all preventable."
"Yeah it's a shit situation for sure, that draft was definitely the Simmons draft and no one predicted he'll have the worst case of the Yips since....Markelle Fultz who was picked before Tatum...ouch.  The Colangelos really fucked the Sixers. The NBA forcing Hinkie to resign was such a shit move comparable to Basketball Reasons"
"Man, all the Sixers' sorrows make me feel so bad for them. They were really fucked when the NBA knee-capped ""the Process"" and brought in Colangelo...like...could you imagine if they never traded to get Markelle Fultz..."
Not to mention the Markelle Fultz Lore is super weird
"The process was Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz. Confirmed failure."
We’ve got a slightly used Markelle fultz to offer. Former #1 overall pick you know
"It's really kind of unbelievable that Shawn Bradley, Keith Van Horn, Evan Turner, Jahlil Okafor, Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz were all top 3 draft picks by Philadelphia."
Markelle Fultz on the Sixers makes them 3peat from 2019-2021 because in this scenario Jimmy probably doesnt leave.
"This is a really intriguing one for me. I'm sure I'm not the first to see the resemblance in this situation to that of Markelle Fultz when he was in Philly, in that a player with high potential (of course Ben has lived up to his more than Markelle so far) is clearly struggling with an issue be it mental or otherwise that is affecting his usability on the court.  Being an Orlando fan myself, I've seen firsthand how moving to a franchise that has no short-term expectations allowed Markelle to play a more free and confident style of basketball prior to his ACL injury.   I think in many ways Ben is a victim of Philadelphia's situation in that they can't afford to give him any more time to work some remnant of a jump shot into his game as they're vying for a title.  I think the main sticking point is pretty obvious though. Ben needs a franchise where the pressure is off but the problem is that to meet Morey's valuation, said franchise would likely have to gut itself of most of its assets leaving Ben as the focal point with a huge contract demanding that he performs.  In Orlando, Markelle had the privilege of joining a franchise where Vooch/AG/Fournier were the focus, allowing him to thrive without the pressure of being a franchise player. Ben just isn't going to be provided with that luxury due to his previous high-level play and the trade value that that has garnered.  Above all else, I hope things get better for Ben Simmons although I believe in order to do so, he will have to move elsewhere. Go back and look at his Summer League outings - the guy has a shot somewhere at the bottom of his bag, he just needs to find it again. I think he'll be okay in the end though."

"Stats don't tell everything friend. They are a good indicator but they are far from the full story. You can write him off now, plenty of people already have, just don't be surprised when he turns it all around. Funny how this originated from a comment about Cole not being a starter over Markelle. When Fultz is superior in every aspect besides shooting...and Cole is a high volume low efficiency scorer his entire life. Both of these players are on my team and I'm happy they will grow together. Fultz has a MIP award coming his way sometime over the next couple of seasons."

Markelle Fultz is a player in the National Basketball Association
A lot more is holding Markelle back from being an all star than just a jumper. Gotta remind y’all Trae Young did not make the all star game this year in the east. Bam Adebayo did not make the all star game this year. Jimmy Butler did not make the all star game. It’s crazy competitive. Is Fultz with a jumper really so much better than guys like Brogdon and FVV who were like 5th and 8th in east all star votes for the snubs.
Markelle Fultz is up there
"Lol, this in a world where Markelle Fultz exists and Wiggins was drafted the year after Anthony Bennett  Those selections are extremely narrative based. Wiggins was defensively elite this season but nobody noticed because they think his story is already written. He was second in the league for OFG%."
Markelle fultz
"1) Markelle Fultz forgetting how to shoot  2) Colangelo’s burners   3) *The Shot*  4) Tobias Harris and Al Horford’s contracts  5) Brett Brown’s coaching   6) Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson  7) injuries in general   8) Brett Brown’s coaching   9) Doc Rivers’ coaching   10) Ben Simmons refusing to shoot   Lot of stressors in the Philly fandom. And to think this is just basketball, they still have to worry about the Eagles too"
"Noel Norlens, Markelle Fultz, Jahil Okafor, Michael Carter Williams. They didn’t have a good scouting team to utilise the picks. Even Joel they lucked into cause of his injury concerns."
"Ok fine, then explain how Markelle Fultz got a 3 year - $50 million extension with the Magic? You really think he gets that with how he's played if he wasn't a former #1 overall pick?"
"Year five of ""Markelle Fultz is gonna be a star"" coming up"
"Except that’s not the case.  Most players were bad or did nothing before Orlando.  Tobias Harris before he got here wasn’t much.  Vuc became an All Star in Orlando.  Fournier became a starter.  AG became a great defensive player.  Markelle Fultz became an actual player.  Cole Anthony has I,proved in year 2.  Mo Bamba finally has developed this year.  Wendell Carter has been way better in Orlando than he ever was in Chicago.  Going further back than that.  Hedo Turkoglu in Orlando finally broke out. T-Mac became a superstar.  Really only Oladipo and Elfrid Payton are the only players I can think who didn’t work out in Orlando and in Oladipo’s case he was traded too early.  So you’re kinda speaking out your ass here."
Recency bias but Jayson Tatum for Markelle Fultz.
"coulda had tatum instead of markelle fultz, crazy"
I know it was a pick trade but what ended up being Jason Tatum and a first round pick for markelle fultz. Go sixers hahaha.
"The Kings trading Jason Thompson, Sauce Castillo &amp; Carl Landry + picks (one first &amp; 2 swap rights) to Philly so they could clear cap space.  The Kings wanted cap space for Rajon Rondo, Wes Matthews &amp; Monte Ellis... except that Wes was using the Kings as leverage to get a better deal elsewhere (and he did from Dallas).  I believe the Kings ended up with Marco Belinelli as a consolation prize.  Those picks ended up being rather juicy, one of the swaps was used by Philly to trade up to #1 overall in order to take Markelle Fultz.  The hilariously #KANGZ pat is that they did this in advance of free-agency rather than waiting until they had commitments from their targeted players to dump salary.  Hinkie pantsed them pretty hard."
"2017: Sacramento loses out on Jayson Tatum, selects De'Aaron Fox (albeit in a timeline where Sacramento has their first Boston probably selects Tatum #1 and Sacramento still takes Fox or even Markelle Fultz)  2019: Boston selects Romeo Langford  Honestly as far as bad trades go, they got off pretty easy."
I thought Markelle Fultz was a generational PG prospect who would be the next great scoring guard. Smh.
Markelle Fultz will be a stud 😔
Markelle Fultz will be James Harden with elite defense
Ben Simmons practice watch is the new Markelle Fultz practice watch.
What the hell is wrong with Philadelphia and their shooters?  or Number one draft picks...  Got Markelle Fultz and now Ben Simmons who have or had glitches in their shots.  Haven't heard of other teams suffering that same fate.
"yeah but pre broken form markelle fultz has a sample size of college and i think summer league, so it’s kind of silly to make a comparison mean anything. if it’s about potential, fultz had harden comps and shit coming in, while OP seemed to be insulting cade"
Markelle Fultz
Might be what he needs to be honest. Fan base with low expectations and a small market with low press coverage. It's what Markelle Fultz needed to go-to ORL
"Much like how your franchise ran off Jimmy Butler, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, and tried to pull a Dennis Schröder on the league by drastically inflating the trade price for Ben Simmons, only to get nothing."
Fax you cant get hate if no one even talks about your team to begin with.    This is like if someone said whats with the lack of Markelle fultz hate
"Gonna look like a genius when both get traded to Orlando for Gary Harris, Markelle Fultz, Mo Bamba and a pair of Disney season passes."
"Kevin Garnett, LeBron James (first Cleveland stint), Tyreke Evans, Marvin Bagley III, Karl Towns, Markelle Fultz (Philadelphia). Zion Williamson might be next"
Markelle Fultz lookin ass
17-18 Suns had some real talent at least. This Magic team looks absolutely listless so far and the return of Markelle Fultz isn't going to do much to change that. So 17-18 Suns easy IMO  Edit: wait you said 17-18!! 18-19 Suns... hmm idk
You can use all the bricks leftover from when Markelle Fultz was working on his broken shot.
Markelle Fultz has entered the chat
"Watch Simmons have Thoracic Outlet Syndrome like Markelle Fultz, which is why he has no jumper or 3 point shot."
Simmons on the phone with Markelle Fultz trying to get a referral
"Markelle Fultz has a very real, physical nerve issue that prevents him from naturally extending his arm in a shooting motion. The same thing happened with Landry Fields.  The idea that he simply had the “yips” or some mental issue is not true"
Markelle Fultz type shit
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720819-ben-simmons-says-hes-a-starting-pg-believes-he-can-play-with-markelle-fultz
that was the markelle fultz year  fultz finally came back and immediately broke embiids face with the shoulder that was injured leading to the whole phantom of the process stuff.  The number 1 pick forgetting how to shoot is like middle of the pack for sixers weirdness to be fair
"It was definitely more than just 3 years.    2013: Nerlens Noel - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2014: Joel Embiid - Injured, Missed first two seasons  2015: Jahlil Okafor - Not Injured, Mega bust  2016: Ben Simmons - Injured, Missed Rookie year  2017: Markelle Fultz - Injured, Missed 68 games in Rookie year  2018: Zhaire Smith - Injured/Near death allergic reaction, Missed 76 games in Rookie year and only played 13 total career games"
The Process edition:  Markelle Fultz  Michael Carter-Williams  Ben Simmons  Jahlil Okafor  Nerlen Noel
I dunno that Markelle Fultz kid might help. That would be a pretty even trade.
"You somehow simultaneously acknowledge how hard it is to build a contender because ""shit happens"", while also parroting that dead meme about the process being a lie.   The process waa never about a guaranteed title. It was about greatly increasing your odds at a title, and it was proven incredibly valid and intelligent strategy. It was just bad luck that two of those #1 overall picks happened to be Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz. Shit happens.  If the first overall picks in those years werent weird anamolies, nobody would be saying that stupid shit anymore about the process being dumb or ""a lie"""
"I think it was pretty bad..  &gt; Bedridden, in constant pain, and unable to eat or drink, Zhaire could only sleep for 30 minutes at a time, and only with the help of morphine. He spent his nights watching 76ers game films and doing some informal scouting for coach Brett Brown, who would check in with him on FaceTime. Then-teammate Markelle Fultz often texted, but Zhaire rarely had the energy to respond. He was too weak to do physical activities, save for thumb wars with Aundre, who slept by his side at the hospital each night. Zhaire’s days were spent meditating with his mom, Andrea. The only other way to help Zhaire relax was the repetitive motion of twisting his hair. “They were calming me down, but I was throwing temper tantrums,” Zhaire says. “Everyday, I was like, ‘Am I getting out? Can I drink? Can I eat? I was so thirsty.”’     &gt; A few weeks before Thanksgiving, Zhaire returned home with a feeding tube, three other tubes, a 24-hour nurse, and the steady, constant presence of Andrea and Aundre, who lived a few minutes away. Down to 160 pounds, he was too weak to do pushups or lift weights."
It's all good by then Markelle Fultz will be in his prime and complete the process by coming home
"There was a literal billboard outside the Sixers arena that said ""We believe in you Markelle!"" when Fultz was still here."
"Lonnie Walker, Jarred Vanderbilt, RJ Hampton, Markelle Fultz, KPJ"
Prime Markelle Fultz
Westbrook with the prime Markelle Fultz statline.
"Lemme take a crack at writing the opening, but it might sound pretty similar to their moment on kawaiis shot:  2019 was a big year for the NBA's eastern conference. LeBron had dominated the conference for almost a decade, having taken his team to the Finals from 2011-2018. However, in the summer of 2019, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers of the Western Conference, making the title of Eastern Conference Champion suddenly available to teams that didnt have a LeBron James on the roster for the first time in eight years.   One of the teams with the best shot at that title, and a shot at the 2019 NBA championship? The Philidalphia 76ers.   Two of the men who led them in 2019 were home picked. Grabbed with the number 3 and 1 pick in 2014 and 2016 respectively by General Manager Sam Hinkie, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons were a lethal, towering duo (slap player stickers on here). While the league was spared initially as Embiid sat out his first two years with a foot injury, his dominant, physical game brought back memories of transcedent big men of yore, and when Simmons debuted after his own year spent recovering from foot injury, it took him just four games to notch his first triple double. His dazzling passes and imposing drives drew comparissons to Magic Johnson and Lebron James, and Philidalphia fans everwhere salivated at the prospect of this duo leading their long suffering city to glory.   Then in 2018, with Lebron James and his Eastern Conference Champion hogging ways off in the West, 76ers management pulled the trigger. Recent #1 pick Markelle Fultz was swapped for Clippers star Tobias Harris, and a disgruntled Jimmy Butler was aquired from the Timberwolves after he politely and calmly asked for a trade, coach Brett Brown had perhaps the most lethal starting five in the East, winning 10 of their last 15 games to go into the playoffs determined to complete the Process and bring glory to the City of Brotherly Love.   Through the first round of the playoffs, it looked like they would do just that, finishing off the Brooklyn Nets in a gentlemans sweep 4-1, blowing them out in 3 of their 4 wins by double digits or more.   They went up 2-1 in the second round against the Raptors, before losing a tight game 4 where Philly had chances to take the lead down the stretch. They would get blown out in game 5, but showed life in game 6 where a balanced attack by all four of Phillys stars helped force a decisive game 7.  While game 7 was in Toronto, the 76ers definitely brought the spirit of Philidalphia with them north of the border, with all four stars once again scoring in the double digits, though Toronto's superstar acquisition in Kawhi Leonard went absolutely supernova to keep the game tied down the stetch, with Toronto having only 4.2 seconds on the likely last posession of the game.   Still, with the most dominant big man in the game in Embiid, a lethal closer in Jimmy, a steady distributing hand in Simmons, and a lethal terrtiary gunner in Harris, and a somewhat hobbled Toronto roster, the 76ers liked their chances in OT. All they had to do was get a stop and-   (Clip of kawhis shot)   Oh no. Who knew a basketball could bounce that many times and still go in?   And just like that, the fruit that was so carefully nurtured by Sam Hinkie from the manure of the early and mid 2010s Sixers rotted on the vine, then all the vermin in Philly descended and tore the fruit to pieces. And probably pooped on it some more.   Collapse music."
"38% career and he came in with a super janky jumpshot. he was lights-out in college and went through a mini markelle fultz situation where he developed a weird hitch going into his rookie year, only shot 33% after being a 40% shooter in college. not sure if he can keep up 42/43%, but he's a sniper."
&gt;Cunningham has his whole career ahead of him.  so did markelle fultz at one point.
"The difference is the twisties can cause you serious bodily harm, the yips just hurts your pride and your shooting percentage. If Simone fucked up a flip in her routine because her spatial awareness is out of whack and landed wrong, she could break her neck or her back, as at least a few gymnasts have done.   There is also the fact that Simone was abused for real. Ben Simmons has been catered to by his team at every turn, and defended by his coach and teammates for years until they KIND OF criticized him at the end of a playoff series where he objectively failed the team. That's not abuse. I'm sure he's getting awful abuse from fans, and that's wrong, but at this point, every athlete has to deal with that.  I get it, it's embarrassing and uncomfortable to be a pro player with the yips. But Markelle Fultz had/has it worse than Simmons and doesn't get the same hate. Why? Because he's working to get through it. He's not shafting his teammates out of hurt ego.  Ben Simmons is not comparable to Simone Biles in any way."
"I mean winning 6 championships is fun but would you rather watch that documentary or the one that has the process, mystery of Markelle Fultz, Jerry Colangelo's burner accounts, Shirley temples, Okafor getting guns pulled on him outside a club, Ben Simmons...."
"Tyrese Maxey, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Darius Garland, Rui Hachimura and screw it, ALL of Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba (BUY MAGIC STOCK!)"
Markelle Fultz got a rookie extension and Deandre Ayton didn't. Mad world.
"People can bicker all they want about whether Ayton is ""worth"" the max as a player, but here's an interesting point:  Of the last 10 #1 picks, 8 have received the max extension.  The only two who did not are Anthony Bennett and Markelle Fultz.  A franchise like Phoenix is not a huge free agent destination like LA or Miami (even after their run last year), so they really need to hold on to as much homegrown talent as possible.  When you draft a guy with a high pick who performs reasonably well and has potential, it makes too much sense to extend him.  I understand the gripes with Ayton's game, but a lot of those gripes were there when Phoenix made the pick in the first place.  Obviously, they were comfortable enough with his game and what he brought to take him #1 and I don't think he's been so much of a bust to not warrant the max extension."
Magic (when Markelle and Isaac come back):       PG: Fultz/Cole  SG: Suggs/RJ  SF: Ross/Franz  PF: Isaac/Okeke  C: Bamba/WCJ
"Yeah, none of this is new. When you pick first in the draft, you have to assume that even if the guy isn't yet an all star, as long as he isn't a complete Anthony Bennett situation or Markelle Fultz situation, you're going to have to give him a max extension or match a max offer. And if you assume you'll have to match a max offer anyway, it's better to extend him instead of risking him taking a Gordon Hayward type shorter deal to escape sooner."
Markelle Fultz being really good
"No a bust is someone who doesn’t come close to what they were drafted for. For a #1 pick the expectation is always at least all star caliber player, not a streaky role player. For example Markelle Fultz is just a bust at this point."
"If hinkie didn't think Fultz was a generational talent he would have traded down for ""more bites of the apple"". he largely considered drafting to be an imperfect science. Colangelo managed to make a pile of only slightly bad moves where people can't question just one, but when you put them all together it's death by a thousand cuts. and yes Colangelo didn't listen to the left over hinkie people who weren't sure about Fultz. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2780982-bryan-colangelo-reportedly-overruled-76ers-execs-about-drafting-markelle-fultz"
I think since being in orlando he’s grown a lot. He’s knocked down 3s early in preseason so that might come together soon maybe? He’s definitely gotten better hands and is an above average finisher at the rim. I think (a lot like markelle fultz) he just needed a change of scenery.
"**Some modern ones:**  * Jerry West convincing the Warriors NOT to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.  He really didn't like Love's lack of defense * Hornets letting Kemba walk instead of offering him a max contract, not trading for Westbrook, and drafting Lamelo might prove to be a genius move * The Clippers trading Blake Griffin super early into his contract * Trading the #1 pick and presumptive first overall pick Markelle Fultz for the 3rd pick and Jayson Tatum"
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Don't sell the Sixers short. They also put a lot of eggs in the Markelle Fultz basket.
I mean you guys haven’t exactly been hitting the nail on picks either. Markelle Fultz was a massive bust
"It's kind of weird, since I wouldn't really consider any of those 4 to be at the same level or good comparisons between each other.  I think with Luka Jayson Tatum would be better example of being a young player in the similar level.  With Trae it would be someone like Bam Adebayo, although it's very possible if not even likely that Trae will take the jump this year to a higher level if he can limit his defensive liabilities a bit. (or his team uses him in different kind of defensive role). In his current state it was kind of difficult to find other players of similar position and size to him. I'd say he's somewhere comfortably higher than Kemba, but at least based on last year a step or two behind Holiday. Good comparison of his ideal future would be someone like Lillard who is also relatively (although not quite as) short point guard who's negative on defense but major positive on offense which is basically Trae's profile right now.  For Ja Morant maybe someone like Brandon Ingram could be more fitting comparison of someone that provides similar value overall.  Then for Herro I think Kuzma example already given in this thread was great. Also names that float around him that  I'd bring up are Markelle Fultz or Svi Mykhailuk."
Markelle Fultz was injured in a motorcycle accident that was covered up because it would have voided his contract
He's going to have a boo-boo the second he steps off the plane and we'll have another round of the Markelle Fultz private doctor saga. I hate it here
Looks like Masai was right again. Not sure why people keep questioning him. He has proven to be a basketball mastermind. Scottie Looks like a Giannis/AD hybrid. While Suggs looks like Markelle Fultz.
Markelle fultz. I thought he was a generational PG prospect. Sigh.
Markelle Fultz was also a consensus pick and that didn’t stop Ainge from going against the grain and trading down to get the best player in that draft.
"This may not count as part of ""the great NBA teams,"" but it did make me think ""what if Markelle Fultz didn't get injured?""  Could have been a completely different Sixers team."
Is this about to be the Reverse Markelle Fultz?
Markelle is mediocre. Imo they should roll with a Suggs- Anthony back court (two fit nicely) with fultz as a quality sixth man
Tisse Is also older than former teammate Markelle Fultz
Ahhh the Markelle Fultz special
Colangelo spent 4 first round picks to draft Markelle Fultz and Andrezj Pasecniks.  He was as big of a failure from asset management perspective as he was from a relationship management perspective.  A complete fraud in every sense of the word
Markelle Fultz says hi.
"Andrew Wiggins. Anthony Bennett. Markelle Fultz. Andrew Bogut. Andrea Bargnani. Chris Webber. Kenyon Martin.   Those are some players that were drafted first that I do not recall the teams building around, though I’m sure I’m wrong about a few guys here. To be fair, to only include first overall picks you very quickly start to get to before many of us watched basketball or were old enough to know what a basketball was, and definitely before players had such power and freedom to change teams."
"&gt; This includes MANY #1 picks.   I'd go beyond that. It includes almost all #1 picks in recent history:  * 2013 - Anthony Bennett was never the priority over Kyrie, traded soon after * 2014 - Andrew Wiggins was immediately traded, and after Wiggins' first year, KAT was the priority * 2015 - KAT, an exception * 2016 - Ben Simmons, whose team has at least clearly tried to make him guy 1B and has consistently campaigned for him to win awards and tried to get him to step up and do more so he CAN be the priority * 2017 - Markelle Fultz, everyone knows this one * 2018 - Deandre Ayton, obviously behind Booker always * 2019 - Zion, duh * 2020 - Anthony Edwards, behind KAT  So, 8 #1 picks, only 2 of whom were the priority on their teams"
"He already knows how to do that too, having watched Markelle Fultz and his ""diagnosis of exclusion""!"
Exactly. Does this source not know the name Markelle Fultz or does the source only knows of players they represent?
"&gt;“What No. 1 pick you know comes to an organization that has no prioritization at all?” said a source, who felt Simmons was wronged.   Ben got treated a lot better than their other former number 1 pick Markelle Fultz lol. Colangelo even wanted to trade Embiid and build around his #1 pick, Ben."
"What if Ben Simmons got what Markelle Fultz had, forgot the name of that shit but he lost his muscle memory and forgot how to shoot?"
"Timberwolves get: Ben Simmons  76ers get: Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and Markelle Fultz  Magic get: Patrick Beverley and Jaylen Nowell  I am not even going to pretend I’ve watched half these players and just matched money for “lol Fultz back to 76ers”  Who even would win this trade?"
RJ Barrett  Markelle Fultz  Aaron Nesmith   Are all my picks
"Fuck it, Markelle Fultz is my pick."
"I played JV against Markelle Fultz, we went to a rival high school, and it was clear he was so different. We had two kids on the team that would eventually play D-I, and he just couldn’t be slowed down. The biggest thing that stood out other than his athleticism and shot was his defense. The guy was literally everywhere getting both steals and blocks. Think he averaged like 5 steals and 3 blocks that season as a point guard."
"Nikeil Alexander Walker, Killian Hayes, Deangelo Russell (people know he’s good but he’s been passed around a lot because no one thinks they can win with him), Cam Reddish, Tyler Herro, Colin Sexton, Markelle Fultz."
He’s like if you fused Celtics Shaq and Markelle Fultz
"I also think ""player X is not a bust"" is typically not what you say about someone showing superstar upside. You would comment directly on the superstar upside instead.   Like I don't remember people saying ""LeBron won't be a bust"". Typically what you would hear was ""LeBron is special and is the heir apparent to Michael Jordan""  Meanwhile for someone like Markelle Fultz, you would hear things like ""he's not a bust, he's only 19 years old! He'll be fine""."
"Philly fans are the worst? Do you remember how loud Wells Fargo cheered when Ben Simmons hit a 3 in a random regular season game vs. the Knicks? Or how bout the time that Markelle Fultz sat out a season and a half cause of god knows what only to be met with raucous applause when he became the youngest player to drop a triple double (at the time)? Philly fans are brutal yes, but are incredibly supportive until given a reason to behave otherwise. I was one of the biggest Ben Simmons fans out there, but what he’s doing to utterly sabotage the team and the city that gave him nothing but support and optimism for 5 years is unacceptable and a slap in the face to everyone who’s ever rooted for this man. He deserves everything he gets."
Prodigal son has to leave. Ben simmons or markelle fultz would be a prodigal son. Did no one pay attention to biblical stories as a kid? I'm not even Christian.
markelle fultz -&gt; james harden   jalen suggs -&gt; jason kidd  chuma okeke -&gt; robert covington  jonathan isaac -&gt; rashard lewis  wendell carter jr -&gt; al horford    cole anthony -&gt; mo williams  rj hampton -&gt; dante exum  terrence ross -&gt; eddie jones  franz wagner -&gt; mike dunleavy jr  mo bamba -&gt; rudy gobert  thats pretty damn good
"I dont blame Ben for wanting out at all, the 76ers front office has been awful since he got drafted. Robert Covington, Mikal Bridges and Markelle Fultz are 3 players that are perfect for the team but they traded RoCo and other trade pieces for 1 year of Jimmy Butler (who eventually turned into Seth Curry who i love but id prefer RoCo if i had the choice). Mikal Bridges move completely baffled me and the Fultz situation disgusted me by how the front office acted.   Add all of that ontop of the fact that both their coaches have been subpar (Brett Brown seemed like a nice guy but had some severe mental lapses as a coach) and Doc Rivers... it just seems like he doesnt have people skills, what he said at that interview and the interviews after that is just a joke, and if thats what is being said publicly, whats being said behind closed doors and at practice. I dont blame Ben for not shooting or being aggressive if that's how little confidence his coach has in him.  AND add all the trade rumors hes been dealing with and its all a disaster waiting to happen.  Now saying all that im not saying Ben is blameless, if he ever wants to be a Super Star player he has to change his mind set, he has to hold himself accountable and take initiative. He has all the skills but he doesnt have the mentality to be great, at least not yet. But the amount of criticism he gets is completely disproportionate to the amount of blame he holds."
"The last twenty (before Cade):  Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, DeAndre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, LeBron James, Yao Ming, Kwame Brown.   **HOF:** Yao, LeBron, Dwight, Rose are all sure things. I fully expect AD, Kyrie and Zion to get there.   **Franchise Star:** Griffin, Wall, KAT, Simmons, Ant.   **Really Good:** Bogut, Ayton.   **Meh to Complete Bust:** Brown, Bargnani, Oden, Bennett, Fultz.   Looking at it like that you're spot on - someone in that franchise star level is around the median (as opposed to mean)."
Markelle Fultz is gonna prove everybody wrong
"Or maybe we can start blaming the 76ers. Except Embiid (he was gonna be a dawg anyway) they failed to develop any lottery pick they had and they had many. I see so many players who had a decent shot before they join there busting. markelle fultz for example. We don't know what happened,but besides development if I was in Ben's position I would be pissed with them as well.It's not like they tried to trade him 123123123 times before any of these things happened."
"&gt;The difference is PG didn’t play any games. He didn’t demand a trade and ghost the FO. He came to them with a very specific trade request that set them up to have one of the best futures in the league due to the circumstances around them. Ben basically did the exact opposite of that lmao.     Ben is trying to leave the Sixers but they still want to contend. The thunder called it quits. It made it much easier to match assets. That being said, Morey holding out for another superstar which is very wishful thinking.        &gt;KD literally took pay cuts to play in GS. Winning was the biggest priority for him. Not money.    You don't know that because max money was an even playing field. He would have been eligible for a supermax with the thunder the same offseason when he missed most of the season. You really think he turns that type of money down after a season in which he played 27 games? That's highly unlikely.     &gt; Players are assets. Employees.    Foolishness. Nothing is stopping Ben from doing what Kyrie did and elect for a season ending surgery that will ensure he gets his money and Philly gets nothing. If you think this is still a one way business you are on something strong.      I agree Simmons is risking a lot but the Sixers haven't exactly stood by their own guy. The guy was a DPOY candidate and they were first in the east. They shat on him publicly. Whether he's right or wrong how do you build chemistry if you turn on each other at the first sign of trouble. Blindly supported is such a myth, look at how Markelle Fultz turn out since he left."
Markelle Fultz
"Didn't Markelle Fultz ask a bunch of different physicians until he got a Thoracic Outlet Syndrome diagnosis?   I imagine if you go around asking as many physicians as possible you'll end up with a medically true albeit iffy diagnosis that he could use for the basis of not playing.   Regardless I think whatever money Simmons loses is probably a drop in the bucket for him, compared to getting out of Philly and playing somewhere else."
Isaiah Thomas.  Markelle Fultz.  At least Kemba got the huge contract
Markelle Fultz?
In college Markelle Fultz was a sharpshooter. Doesn’t mean anything
&gt;	Markelle is one of the most resilient players I’ve seen  Fultz quit on the team the first time Brett dared to play TJ over him
"maybe it was cheap, i got an official markelle fultz philly jersey for like $12 cause nobody else wanted it"
"I have been watching a few games lately. Here's what I want to see, because I'd like to win a few.  PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Markelle Fultz  SF: Franz Wagner  PF: Jonathan Isaac  C: Wendell Carter, Jr. _____ 2nd unit: Suggs, Hampton, T. Ross, Okeke, Bamba"
"&gt;He spent his second season, at 21, converting from power forward to point guard, while starting in the NBA  This is just false, his agent clearly stated to teams that he was a point guard. [He also stated that year that he was a point guard.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720819-ben-simmons-says-hes-a-starting-pg-believes-he-can-play-with-markelle-fultz) It has always been part of his identity as a basketball player. When they used to start TJ, JJ, and Ben, they officially listed TJ and Ben as guards and JJ as a forward just to satisfy his ego."
Doesn’t mean they aren’t not a bust either. When you start rivaling Anthony Bennett with historically bad stats. It’s only natural people start to wonder if Markelle Fultz was reincarnated
"I want Jayson Tatum to flame out in Boston because the Celtics so obviously won the Markelle Fultz trade with my Sixers. Basic, I know."
"Yea but during a 5ish year stretch they drafted Michael Carter Williams, Jahlil Okafor, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Dario Saric, Zhaire Smith, and Nerlens Noel all in the first round. Of those picks only Embiid has worked out for them.   At the start of the process they traded away Jrue Holiday who is a 15-20 ppg perennial DPOY candidate now. He’s no Embiid but the process is ultimately a failure, as they are looking to ship out Simmons and build up a new team. Ironically Maxey looks like a future all-star and they got him with the 21st pick.   Yes I’m being petty but I’ve relished in their failed drafting and I think that Hinkie is overrated and actually got out at the perfect time. I’m a big fan of Embiids game though and hope he wins a ring at some point (with them or somewhere else). I hope OKC follows a similar path."
Markelle fultz is a cautionary tale
Jonathan Isaac  Cole Anthony   Franz Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr  Jalen Suggs  Markelle Fultz  Mo Bamba  Chuma Okeke
"Also NOBODY expected Fultz to turn out like this, horrible take from you considering Markelle was considered the consensus pick"
Cade Cunningham is pretty great but what happened to Killian Hayes? I thought he was a solid player? Or is he like Markelle Fultz?
"Link below for the ""find a new slant"". Bryan Colangelo, metaphorically speaking, has a tiny, tiny penis.    https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/29/17406750/bryan-colangelo-philadelphia-76ers-twitter-joel-embiid-anonymous-markelle-fultz"
"Dejounte Murray’s “breakout” season is completely fabricated hype, the dude is the definition of volume stats on a bad team.  Sure his volume stats may be up but he’s Markelle Fultz level inefficient."
This is gonna end up like Markelle fultz where by the time they trade him he will be almost worthless.
Markelle Fultz
"As opposed to now, where a team could have had a top 5 pick five years straight and ended up with Markelle Fultz, Dragan Bender, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker and Anthony Bennett.  Also assuming of course that in your world absolutely no good prospects ever go to college and national rankings are gospel with no chance of things like workouts and interviews impacting draft order at all.  We already did this for years. There weren’t any more busts 20 years ago than there are now."
what if Ben Simmons and/or Markelle Fultz could shoot 40% from 3 on high volume and difficult shot selection without any weird abnormalities in their shooting form
"Evan Turner, Jahlil Okafor, Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Michael Carter Williams. Philly has a horrendous record of first round picks"
"Lol, the 76's draft the shittiest players. Besides Embiid who we can equate to bad luck with injuries, but still.  Imagine drafting Embiid with the 3rd overall pick in 2014. Okafor with the 3rd overall pick in 2015.  Then with the number 1 overall pick in 2016 Ben Simmons, and then Markelle Fultz the following year with the number 1 overall pick."
All 20+  Furkan Korkmaz  Landry Shamet  Matisse Thybulle  Tyrese Maxey  Top 3  Jahlil Okafor  Markelle Fultz  😫
Im not trying to argue with you. We both clearly enjoy the game. But I dont think he is aesthetically pleasing at all - that's the point.  Same thing with Markelle Fultz.  They are just different.
"I’m glad you mentioned the struggles he went through early on. A lot of people don’t even know about that because we were garbage his rookie year, but he went through a mini Markelle fultz situation. Was cool to see him learn how to be effective as a pure slasher and just making smart cuts, and then resurrect his three point shot over time."
i never said it was. i said they doubted markelle fultz. which is true. i get you’re mad about it and about ben simmons but im right lol
They should trade Simmons for Markelle Fultz.
"I’m a Celts fan and confirm everyone at the time thought/was insanely hyped to draft Fultz. Everyone I knew including myself were shocked when Ainge traded the pick, Markelle was definitely the consensus no. 1 pick at the time"
He loves bad ones that weren't focused on basketball too.  Remember when he [hyped up Markelle Fultz?](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/882033584957136896)
Lol. Markelle Fultz and Okafor both massive busts which wasted a lottery pick. Sure 6ers have been killing it all right.
"True we have done well there. But that only paints half the picture- we also have had some bad misses: Markelle Fultz ahead of Tatum, trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith, drafting Mikal ahead of SGA in the first place, letting Jimmy go to keep the ball in Ben's hands. This just off the top of my head"
He also said Markelle Fultz was a real hooper
"Karl Anthony Towns – 16/40 FG (40%) – 1/1 from 3 (100%)   Ben Simmons – 18/41 FG (44%) – 0/2 from 3 (0%)   Markelle Fultz – 8/23 FG (35%) – 0/0 from 3   Deandre Ayton – 16/29 FG (55%) – 0/0 from 3   Zion Williamson – 24/36 FG (67%) – 4/6 from 3 (67%)   Anthony Edwards – 19/45 FG (42%) – 4/17 from 3 (24%)   Cade Cunningham – 7/39 FG (18%) – 1/21 from 3 (5%)"
"No need to overreact so early on. Cade's got a high floor and he'll eventually get there but the early numbers are what they are. And since everyone is bitching about his stats being comped to Anthony Bennett, here's his numbers next to the last 6 number 1 picks.  Karl Anthony Towns – 16/40 FG (40%) – 1/1 from 3 (100%)  Ben Simmons – 18/41 FG (44%) – 0/2 from 3 (0%)  Markelle Fultz – 8/23 FG (35%) – 0/0 from 3  Deandre Ayton – 16/29 FG (55%) – 0/0 from 3  Zion Williamson – 24/36 FG (67%) – 4/6 from 3 (67%)  Anthony Edwards – 19/45 FG (42%) – 4/17 from 3 (24%)  Cade Cunningham – 7/39 FG (18%) – 1/21 from 3 (5%)"
"Stats i provided: FG% and FGM by 2 No. 1 overall picks that had similar situations to start their careers as Cade (injured).   Context: I specifically took only the games those players needed to reach Cade’s 39 FGA, to make it more fair. In those games they performed better than Cade.   How it helps: By using players with the same situations and with the same sample size, you can more fairly judge Cade based on how other players who had the same potential/talent he had (No. 1 picks). And it doesn’t look good. Furthermore, I didn’t just take Zion and ran with it. Why? Cuz he can be considered a basketball prodigy. So what did i do? Add a “bust” in the mix: Markelle. Cade still doesn’t hold up.   Comparison: Since you said they’re different players so the comparison isn’t relevant, I compared Fultz and Cade specifically as they have similar scouting reports. “Oversized point guards who can bully smaller guards in the paint” etc. It’s as good a comparison as you can get.   Context: they have similar playstyles, even agreed amongst professional NBA-level scouters. So this is a reliable comparison as these guys are basicaly saying Cade and Fultz have similar playstyles.   How it helps: As 2 players who have similar playstyles and similar situations, it’s a great comparison to judge Cade by. He doesn’t reach Fultz’s benchmark, further proving my point that Cade has been performing terribly.   Does sound like a guy “drooling” over himself? What I’ve noticed is that as this argument has stretched out, you have more frequently relied on trashing me instead of my points. You have yet to even provide a link to stats that help Cade’s argument, let alone what I just said in this comment."
"Markelle Fultz scouting report: [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/markelle-fultz/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/markelle-fultz/)  Cade Cunningham scouting report: [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/cade-cunningham/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/cade-cunningham/)  Incredibly similar report by professionals on these 2 guys. That and the fact that both were injured to start the season makes Fultz a great benchmark to compare Cade to. Fultz may have had 2 more preseason games, but his more severe injury takes away that advantage. And the thing is: Fultz isnt exactly a high bar to reach. Cade hasnt even come close.  So no, just because they're different people doesn't mean their playstyle and skills are completely different."
"This might surprise you a bit, but Cade Cunningham, Zion Williamson, and Markelle Fultz are different people and their performance is wholly irrelevant to one another."
"Markelle Fultz 2017-18 Game log: https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/4066636/type/nba/year/2018  When your favorite player is playing historically bad, at some point you have to admit it, and when he turns it around I’ll be there to say he’s mentally tough for not letting this shooting slump affect his confidence. Will you still be there if he continues to slump?"
"Markelle Fultz with 2 preseason games experience, an injury to his shooting shoulder, a jumper that got broken and against the top 2 teams in the East in his first 4 games shot 37.5% from the field on 15-40 shooting. That’s better than Cade who had an ankle sprain.   A shooting shoulder injury affects shooting more than an ankle injury. So Cade doesn’t have an excuse to be shooting way worse than Fultz did."
"Let’s look into 2 No. 1 picks who were injured to start their careers.   1. Zion Williamson. Sure, he played the preseason, but he still missed a lot of games to start. Once he got back? 24-36 from the field. Competition? The #3 Nuggets and #3 Celtics in 2 of his first 3 games. Stats? 16-25 from the field. Zion had one less made field goal and 3 more 3s in 1 game than Cade has so far. He was a prodigy? Let’s take a look at Rookie 2.   2. Markelle Fultz. Widely considered a bust by his first season. Played 2 preseason games, then didn’t play until November. And guess what? He injured his shooting shoulder. That impacts shooting more than Cade’s ankle sprain. What was Markelle’s stats to start? 15-40 from the field. That’s 37.5%. Bad competition? On his way to 40 FGA, Fultz went against the Raptors and Celtics. The top 2 teams in the East at the time.   And these aren’t full season stats. I took their games that made them reach Cade’s 39 FGA, and both performed way better than Cade has. Even freaking Fultz with an injury to his shooting hand and a broke jumper shot better than Cade is."
Just worried that it would drastically affect his confidence and we might have another Markelle Fultz situation. He definitely has the potential to turn it around.
Cade is more like Markelle Fultz than the next superstar
Didn’t you do this exact thing to Markelle Fultz?
"A multi year 50 40 90 shooter being compared to markelle fultz is logical, dont let the haters hold you down"
Markelle Fultz says hi
"&gt; Jamal when he was maxed was very inconsistent and was averaging 18/4/5 on 54 ts% with bad defense. That type of player is not worth a max. This is a fact proven by the existence of players of similar caliber none of which are getting paid the max. The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  You mean a 20 year old was inconsistent? Shocking. A 20 year old averaging 18/4/5 with bursts of amazing play is exactly who gets the RFA max contract. I think you're thinking of supermax contracts which come after something like that.   Why? Because a team sees clear evidence in growth in the player as they've been in their system for years. They see a higher ceiling and as they mature and gain more experience (like every player in league history) they will become more consistent.   Otherwise they get the rookie extension which is for players like Grayson Allen, Larry Nance Jr., Kyle Kuzma, Luke Kennard, Markelle Fultz, etc. or the let Jamal Walk into RFA and feel disrespected or not believed in by the team, another team with the space gives him the max and then Denver matches it but with 1 less year on the contract.  &gt; The conclusion is that he was given the contract based on his potential.  Well...yeah. Of course. He had the same first 3 years as Devin Booker but just had less shots because Jokic was there. Same as Donovan Mitchell. All of these players are getting this contract based on their potential to grow and the teams belief that they will reach that potential. No player is an actualized or realized player at 21 or 22 years old.   When Jokic was averaging 18/11/6 did they sign him thinking that was going to be his peak? Of course not. When Mitchell was averaging 24/4/4 and shooting terribly from 3 and playing 0 defense did the Jazz sign him to the rookie max thinking that was the player they were going to get forever? No.  &gt; Reaching his potential or even improving at all was in no way a given.  A generic statement that can be applied to any player ever. Embiid being able to play 1/2 of a season when he got his extension wasn't a given. Trae Young finding a way to not be the worst defender at his position in the league and shoot better than 43 from the floor or 34 from 3 isn't a given--but he got his max. Fox turning out to not just be a stat accumilator on a terrible team when he was given his max isn't a given. KAT not being a black hole on offense and a terrible defensive player when he was given his max wasn't a given.   &gt; There were some things that were encouraging and would leave you to believe he's gonna improve, there were also huge red flags that would lead you to believe the opposite.  I don't know what red flags you're talking about. Year 1 to year 2 Jamal had a massive jump. Year 2 to year 3 Jamal's defense and playmaking took a huge steo up. Year 3 to year 4 Jamal took another step up in all areas and then obviously we saw the bubble. Then sure enough year 4 to year 5 was another giant step up.  There were no greater red flags with Jamal Murray than there are with any player at that age, and far more positives considering the nearly linear growth (and growth is never truly linear) compared to his peers.   &gt;  Waiting a year for him to hit RFA would've cost them nothing and alleviated a lot of the risk.  This isn't 2K. There is a human element to showing belief and trust in your player, especially for this Nuggets team and management, especially for all small market teams. You don't just get to let someone go to RFA and pretend like that doesn't stick with them, upset them, be in the back of their mind when they come up for free agency down the road. That's life. It has happened time and time again. If you think your player is worth matching a max in RFA then you max him on your own, otherwise you just bothered a cornerstone player of your franchise and also signed him to 1 less year than you could have.  &gt; Just because he turned out to be worth the max doesn't make maxing him a smart decision.   I guess it's a good thing that our front office of professionals designed to scout, draft, evaluate, train, and put players in positions to succeed before assessing the risk of 9-figure paydays knows better than you what is and isn't a 'smart decision'. It was a bad take then and I'm sure people let you hear it at that point just as they are now. It was a smart decision as a team, as a franchise, as a culture building organization, and as a small market team. No brainer.  &gt; This wasn't/isn't a reactionary take, all of you are just braindead.  Yes. It is everyone else who is wrong. Certainly not worth stepping back and reassessing your thoughts on a situation when everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong. It is the children who are out of touch!"
"Creating good looks means nothing if you can't knock them down though.  I hope he turns it around, and I'm almost certain he will. But for perspective, he's 0-14 from three so far in his career. Markelle Fultz, with all of his struggles, has never had a stretch of games where he shot 0-14 from three."
"I've been hearing a lot of comparisons to Markelle Fultz, which is really unfair. Fultz has never had a stretch of games where he shot 0-14 from three."
You know who else needed time to work into a new shot? Markelle Fultz
Markelle Fultz
Next Markelle Fultz
Damn what’s he played 2 games or 2 seasons? And Markelle Fultz is a dog? This post smh
Last first overall with this type of debut was Markelle Fultz preceded by Anthony Bennett.  People are going to downvote this but the precedent is certainly not great
He looks like the next Markelle Fultz
"You’re right, Cole is making is look very hard to justify sitting him in favor of fultz when he gets back. I guess you could start fultz at the 2 and have Suggs off the bench, but may as well just bring Markelle in on second unit. I can’t wait to get fully healthy and see what this team looks like. They still need to make a couple moves for a scorer I think though"
"I'm sure this sub wouldn't agree, but Markelle Fultz would be a good fit on the Celtics. His understanding of offense and playmaking doesn't get the credit it deserves because of his shooting woes, but he's so saavy in the half court with the ball in his hands. Not a huge assist guy, but he knows how to manipulate defenders.   Obviously there are guys better than him, but none of those guys would be available to the Cs. Not that Fultz is available, but he's more available than CP3, Trae, Lowry, etc."
"Nah, I think we really need a point guard who can shoot.  Do you guys know if Markelle Fultz is available?"
"Still trying to find his place. He'd benefit playing with a playmaker but he's currently being used as backup PG and it's failing. When Fultz is back, RJs mins may get squeezed until Gary, or Ross, or both are traded. Then, he'll play with Cole or Markelle.   Skill -wise, his defense is improved, his shooting is improved, and handles need improvement. Still jumping to pass and getting caught mid-air or easily getting the ball swiped when driving. Year 3 &amp; 4 is when I expect a coming out party."
"Yeah and then he was hurt in the playoffs for the second straight season with you.  At some point playing games matter especially in the playoffs and the last time he played in the playoffs and without trying to sabotage his team was 2017.  Russell Westbrook was the MVP, Pau Gasol was still a starting center in the NBA, and Markelle Fultz was viewed as the best point guard prospect since...Kyrie that's how long ago it was"
Markelle Fultz's defense pre-injury. I saw a lot of Vucevic cleaning up his messes when Fultz didn't fight through the screen before the trade
He looks like Markelle Fultz 2.0.
"Between Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, and now Zion, family members have been A1 career killers for former number 1 draft picks lmaoo. However I feel like Zion can turn it around but only if he really wants to. Sucks to see something like this happen"
Looks like the next Markelle Fultz
On a serious note I have a feeling Cade might be the next Markelle Fultz.
"For those curious, here's the debut game from the last ten #1 overall picks:  Name | PTS | AST | REB | STL | BLK | FG | FGA | 3P | 3PA | FT | FTA | MP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Kyrie Irving | 6 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 26:01 Anthony Davis | 21 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 9 | 29:04 Anthony Bennett | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 14:59 Andrew Wiggins | 6 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 9 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 18:33 Karl-Anthony Towns | 14 | 1 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 31:53 Ben Simmons | 18 | 5 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 34:40 Markelle Fultz | 10 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 17:54 Deandre Ayton | 18 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 36:29 Zion Williamson | 22 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 11 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 18:18 Anthony Edwards | 15 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 12 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 25:09  Nothing too crazy. Simmons and Ayton both had great games. I feel like Zions was the most memorable though, 22 points in 18 minutes, 4/4 on threes, even though the Pelicans lost that was still a fun game. Oh and on that note: Edwards, Ayton, Towns, and Bennett all won their debut. Fultz, Simmons, Wiggins, Davis, Irving, and like I said Zion all lost their debut.  ^^^hopefully ^^^there ^^^aren't ^^^any ^^^mistakes ^^^in ^^^there"
Cade looks like the 2nd coming of Markelle Fultz
"Markelle Fultz, Marvin Bagley 3"
Markelle Fultz + Russ for Ben Would be funny
Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
"James young, jaylen brown, markelle fultz and Collin sexton"
Cole Anthony   Markelle Fultz   RJ Hampton   Michael Carter-Williams   Ben Simmons
"They know what the ""right work"" is, that's how they fixed Markelle Fultz!"
"As a 49 yr old 76er fan born n raised in NE Philly, who remember Mo Cheeks lay-up to clinch the 1983 NBA Championship, I can tell the Reddit World, this Game 7 Loss, the 26pt Game 5 Choke Collapse Loss, and entire Atlanta Series will take decades for Philly to get over....DECADES.....  Nobody and I mean nobody sees how #25 can show his face in the Sixer Uni next year.....he must go....Simmons career literally went down the crapper in the span of 1 Week.....from Perenial All-Star, nearly untradeable due to his immense value, to now, the 76ers would be lucky to get a crap expiring contract....Simmons us due $34mm next year  He has been offered Shootin Coaches, Sports Shrinks, FT Coaches, you name it, the 76er Organization has made all of the resources available to Simmons, but he is too cocky and egotistical to think he needs to take a Jumper....he still think there are no flawa in his game.  Nobody in Pro-Sports has ever witnessed such a sudden collapse of  vaunted player who is yet turned 26yr old.....  Here is the Philly Fan in a nutshell....blue-collar type, very bright sports knowledge, very passionate....will absolutely LOVE any player showing 100% effort, even if the talent is lacking....Philly Lved AI and Barkley and the Phils Aaron Rowand when he busted his face running theu the CF Wall....Philly loved Lindros, but hated his parents.....  If you do not show effort or passion, Philly will hate you regardless who you are  The 76ers can blame themselves!  From Colangelo being a complete Douchebag, drafting Markelle Fultz instead of Jayson Tatum, plus giving Danny Ainge 2 Lottery Pick 1st rounders, to the Jimmy Buckets trade  for Roco &amp; Saric and having Butler tell Brett Brown and Brand, umm thanks but no thanks,Ben Blows I'm signing with Miami, to all of the other wasted Lottery Picks, Noel, MC Williams, Okafor.....and NOW SIMMONS....fuckin joke....total joke  &amp;#x200B;  And dont think Embiid didn't blow in Game 6 &amp; 7.....8 TOs in each game....WTF ....yeah he is an MVP....not"
This seems like the Markelle Fultz situation with extra steps
Why burn it down? The shooting coach is amazing. He totally fixed Markelle Fultz. Right? ......right?
Markelle Fultz wants a word
Banish him to the Magic with Markelle Fultz
"Let's take this to another level. Look at the lottery picks for the sixers since the 2013, the beginning of the process: Nerlens Noel, MCW, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Jalil Okafor, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz and Zhaire Smith. Besides Embiid and Simmons, noting but backups and out-of-the-league guys."
Even up for Markelle Fultz just to drive everyone in Philly completely insane over night.
"Not Philadelphia, Markelle fultz mightve played competent defence on trae young, and then probably produced enough to win game 7.  I bet his yips cured like Jesus healed him just watching that Simmons series"
Markelle Fultz being a headcase cost us a championship in 19  &amp;#x200B;  Ben Simmons doing the same cost us in 21
"Not the whole team, I think it comes down to individual guys and their personalities. Embiid's stats show nothing abnormal for a superstar, more free throws at home on a slightly higher percentage. It just seems to be a unique relationship between Ben Simmons and the Philadelphia crowd, lol.  It might also have to do with guys who are struggling anyway, since Markelle Fultz developed the ""yips"" too in a similar spot."
The Sixers had three top picks during the process era and essentially whiffed on two of them in Simmons and Markelle Fultz. Embid is a stud but sucking for like 5 years or whatever it was just to land one superstar probably isn't worth it.
imagine if the sixers had jaylen brown and jayson tatum instead of ben simmons and markelle fultz (RIP)   TRUST THE PROCESS
"Yeah that's what was weird to me, since people said Markelle Fultz had the same thing and there wasn't a good explanation for either. I mean  he was injured and Ben wasn't a good shooter to begin with, but both didn't improve and had psychological issues."
"Markelle Fultz:  June 19, 2017: Traded by the Boston Celtics **(as a future 2017 1st round draft pick)** to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2017 1st round draft pick (Jayson Tatum was later selected) and a 2019 1st round draft pick (Romeo Langford was later selected). (Future 1st-Rd pick will either be LAL's 2018 pick if it falls between 2 &amp; 5, or the better of PHI &amp; SAC's 2019 picks, unless it is the #1 pick)"
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
&gt;FOH Ben is closer to Markelle Fultz.  More like Chuck Knoblauch
"If I'm not mistaken Markelle Fultz couldn't shoot either. I believe he improved after leaving. It'll be interesting to see if Ben uses this as motivation to improve this off-season. Let's be real Philly, this is your guy the next four years unless he retires out of embarrassement."
"It all comes down to Markelle Fultz IMO. The Sixers are just missing one piece, and to have a #1 pick and get absolutely nothing out of it in the way it happened with Fultz was just too much of a loss for all they did to get those picks."
Ben Simmons for Markelle Fultz
"I'm starting to think that the Philly fans might be wearing some of these guys out. Simmons and Markelle Fultz both started out with problems, but got weirdly worse over time instead of better, and looked like they were scared to make any mistake."
"https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-76ers/sixers-select-markelle-fultz-no-1-overall-pick-nba-draft  https://www.google.fi/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/philly/sports/sixers/2017-NBA-Draft-sixers-76ers-Markelle-Fultz-number-one-james-harden-clone-bilas-rose-espn.html%3foutputType=amp  https://www.google.fi/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2710196-chad-ford-nba-mock-draft-2017-notable-picks-from-espn-gurus-5th-mock.amp.html  So there is three different stories where none of what you are saying is being said. In all of them Fultz or Ball is consensus, I included a mock where Fultz was going to C’s.  I remember those terrible workout reports from Bill Simmons after the draft, which is little hard to take as a negative for Colangelo since it was after the draft. Please do link stories that contradict what I said  This is easy to google you know, it was 2017 and stories are still up. For the record I did not like the pick at the time but only because I thought something was up since Ainge wanted to trade down so he knew something and trading with Danny is death"
I love how so many of you continue to pretend it was impossible for an nba team to not believe in Markelle fultz when another nba team literally traded out of the pick because they didn’t want him
wasn’t fultz the consensus #1 pick tho? I get that ainge liked tatum but nobody was saying markelle going first was a bad pick. Especially considering that he shot 40% from 3 in college
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
Markelle Fultz needed a change of scenery. Now Ben Simmons needs a change of scenery. I don't think that's what Hinkie had in mind with The Process.
"I long for the days when we saw hope in those clips, booned by Markelle Fultz in the background of those shots with the most beautiful of free throws mechanics."
"For comparison, he attempted fewer 3s than Markelle Fultz this year. Fultz played 8 games.   Fultz also boasted almost 90% from the line where well, his nightmare fuel was created.   If you can't see where this is going, Markelle ""Shooting Meme"" Fultz is trending in a better direction."
"What's funny is that the process isn't even the reason the sixers were good.   The Sixers lucked into Embiid.   I don't know if y'all remember this, but coming into the draft Embiid was broken goods.   Prior to that College year, all the rave was with Jabari Parker and Andrew Wiggins and Andrew Wiggins even came in late cause he reclassified his high school graduation year.   But prior to that college year Wiggins and parker were the talk of the town but then Embiid came up big during the college year and was hyped as the \#1 Pick. Then a health report came out that Embiid had some knee issue that would be a problem going forward I think it got compared to what Yao Ming had. So his draft stock fell and Sixers went after the opportunity and drafted Embiid \#3.  I don't think Sixers fans were happy at the time due to said Health issue but Embiid was turned out to be the best Player from that draft. So Sixers got lucky with Embiid.   Then they got Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz and we know how that turned out."
"If we take any of the other guys instead of Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz, it's undoubtedly worth it"
"If we take any of the other guys instead of Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz, it's undoubtedly worth it"
He looks like a big Markelle Fultz. What’s wrong with him?
"ATL went to the ECF in 2015. Lost. Rebuilt the team and are going back to the ECF. ""The Process"" is just an excuse for a shitty organization who spends #1 picks on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz."
"Considering how Markelle Fultz lost his shot with the Sixers too, Imma venture that there's something wrong in the organization"
"In a way, Ben Simmons has had an even more negative impact on the Sixers than Markelle Fultz (the other #1 pick that the Sixers missed on)  Fultz at least was bad early, and the Sixers got rid of him. Simmons showed potential, and the Sixers committed a huge contract to him, and now he's an anchor who can't even be moved easily"
Didn't Markelle Fultz have the same yips here in Philly ?
Hear me out.  Ben Simmons for Markelle Fultz and Gary Harris   Who says no?
"Markelle Fultz need to relearn how to shoot after his ""Injury"" and yet he is still a better shooter than Ben Simmons. LOL!"
He needs some shooting lessons from Markelle Fultz
Trade him for Markelle Fultz.
"markelle fultz Forgot How to shoot, 2 seasons later he can make more Threes then Ben Simmons this is mind blowing"
I don’t think he’s a bust considering Markelle fultz I’m recent years Tony Bennett and those likes …I think he is who he is just an all star
"No. He's still a decent player. If you're really worried about a Sixers bust, look at Jalil Okafor and Markelle Fultz"
Imagine if Bryan Colangelo wasn't an nepotism case and was instead a good GM and drafted Jayson Tatum instead of Markelle Fultz.
Congratulations to the Hawks. They wanted it more. Ben Simmons is Markelle Fultz without a jumpshot
Bro I just remembered poor markelle fultz exists and was taken 1st by the sixers and they traded up to do it oof.
tbf it's not doc's fault that his pg is dollar tree markelle fultz
"This is not a change of scenery thing, this is a Markelle Fultz shellshocked/got the yips type of thing. That layup he didn't go for basically crushed that entire team if you look at how they react, they knew it was over.  Kinda hilarious they also got stuck with the second Fultz incident in league history, awful that this one's on a max deal"
Imagine using two #1 overall picks on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz in back to back drafts
Markelle Fultz woulda had at least 10
Markelle Fultz woulda at least had 10
Huerter's kind of got a Markelle Fultz thing going on with his FT
Sixers fans are sick they got Markelle Fultz 2.0
Seth Curry makes less than Markelle Fultz
"I'd take Ben Simmons  He's incredibly talented, hopefully just going through a case of the yips (Not Markelle Fultz level, yet...)"
"Seriously, is he okay? He turned into Markelle Fultz out of nowhere"
"I totally get what you’re saying —  nobody gets THAT good at *anything* without working at it.   Free throws aren’t that hard to get under control. I’m an old white dude and I could hit around 60% without practicing. I understand the geometry’s different when you’re 6’10” — and you’re using different balls on different goals with different air pressure, temperatures, and humidity levels with varying levels of rest — but MAN. 32.8% is historically BAD.   As far as the shot goes, if Blake Griffin can develop one, Ben Simmons can.   There’s one of two things going on with him: either he’s simply *not interested* in working on developing a free throw routine, or he’s developed some form of the yips (like Markelle Fultz)."
the Markelle Fultz curse lives on in Philly
Hahaha…I may have exaggerated a bit.  Getting the yips and missing bunnies in the playoffs? Markelle Fultz is laughing it up somewhere
"Other than Mo Bamba and Markelle Fultz, I have no idea who is even on the magic"
isn't this the most depressing realisation possible for a team that drafted markelle fultz
Ben “Markelle Fultz” Simmons mentally broken it’s absolutely ridiculous.
"Social media. These kids are reading how what everyone is saying all day long. Once it gets in their head it snowballs. Markelle Fultz, Simmons, Giannis. They know how obvious it is and how talked about it is. They see the trolls and everyone making fun.  It’s like when 2nd basemen all the sudden forget how to throw the ball to first in the MLB"
This reminds me of those markelle fultz days
see markelle fultz
"Markelle fultz forgot how to shoot and then relearned it before Ben Simmons figured out how to hit a 3 in the playoffs,"
That’s Markelle Fultz right?
"Remember Markelle Fultz and how he forgot how to shoot playing with Philly. Now we see where Ben Simmons is coming from. Ben suffering the same mental illness as Markelle. Horrible Shooting Deficiency, HSD."
Markelle Fultz
Markelle Fultz juggles the ball in both hands 3 times 😬
Ben Simmons is trash.  Even Markelle Fultz can shoot now.
May I offer you one Markelle Fultz and Mo Bamba.
funny 76ers love drafting players with the shooting yips...remember markelle fultz
Is Ben Simmons tall Markelle Fultz?   Discuss
Harrison Barnes- US Senator  Pat Riley- Mafia Boss   Gordon Hayward- Pro Gamer   Donovan Mitchell- Arachnologist   Rajon Rondo- Chess world champion  Jaylen Brown- Professor at a university   Damien Lillard- Rolex salesman   Markelle Fultz- Chick-fil-A manager   Chris Paul- High school principal  Serge Ibaka- Gourmet chef  PJ Tucker- Cobbler
maybe they could trade him for that Markelle Fultz guy.
We in Philly will have traded away 4 top 2 picks of the last 5 years from our 4 sports teams combined.  Markelle Fultz  Ben Simmons  Carson Wentz - Eagles  Nolan Patrick - Flyers  I can't take this shit anymore.  And don't get me started on the phillies....   Time to focus on the Union
"**Currently Better than Shai**  *Debatable*  ~~Shai is better~~   Draft Year| Name ---|--- 2011| **Kyrie Irving** 2012| **Anthony Davis** 2013| ~~Anthony Bennett~~ 2014| ~~Andrew Wiggins~~ 2015| **Karl-Anthony Towns** 2016| *Ben Simmons* 2017| ~~Markelle Fultz~~ 2018| *Deandre Ayton* 2019| **Zion Williamson** 2020| *Anthony Edwards*   u r wrong sir. Only 3 of the last 10 #1 are worst than Shai. Ayton, Edwards and Simmons can be debated, but Irving, Davis, KAT and Zion is better than Shai."
Because mental health and a injury are two different things. She had “the twisties” which is basically the gymnastics equivalent of the yips. People didn’t think the same way about Markelle Fultz. Ppl clowned the shit out of him
Markelle Fultz was supposed to be the next James Harden according to basically everyone
"I don't think anyone's writing him off, but you have to remember that NBA teams don't really have players, they have contracts (at least from the team building perspective, which is what we're talking about here).  Reddish is on a rookie deal now where his pay exceeds his production and is likely to continue to do so, but he has immense athletic potential, which is why he was drafted where he was despite being terrible at Duke.  He's going to be up for an extension soon, likely before he even gets a chance to meet his potential (injuries, which you use as an excuse, are a red flag... hurt for 3 years?).  Reddish's next contract will likely exceed his production because guys with his pedigree tend to get overpaid - Harrison Barnes, Andrew Wiggins, Markelle Fultz, etc... - and therefore he's a good candidate to continue to be a bad contract.  Atlanta has a lot of dudes about to get paid, and they have to have some value contracts.  Value contracts tend to be market distortions from superstars (max salary) and rookies that make positive contributions on rookie deals (salary scale).  The Hawks don't need to jump on any offer, but they'd be smart to gauge his value and get some current/future picks that have a chance to turn into contributors on rookie deals like Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges or Halliburton or similarly lower upside guys who can help a team that has its stars.  Another team in a different position might value Reddish's potential more."
"A few better players than PG here taken first, but a “vast majority” aren’t better than him.  2020: Anthony Edwards 2019: Zion Williamson 2018: Deandre Ayton 2017: Markelle Fultz 2016: Ben Simmons 2015: Karl-Anthony Towns 2014: Andrew Wiggins 2013: Anthony Bennett 2012: Anthony Davis 2011: Kyrie Irving 2010: John Wall 2009: Blake Griffin 2008: Derrick Rose 2007: Greg Oden 2006: Andrea Bargnani 2005: Andrew Bogut 2004: Dwight Howard 2003: LeBron James  Yes you’re obviously shooting for the best player, but look at how many misses are there at the first pick. If you have a guaranteed Paul George there at #1, you take him in a typical draft."
watch him end up the next Markelle Fultz
"Right, but similarly Cade's turnover problem is at least a little troubling, and he is more limited athletically, particularly with blow by speed, than Markelle.    Point being neither are literally PERFECT, but I think they are/were viewed as prospects with essentially zero major flaws, and projected as very well rounded and positive players on both ends on the floor. Even their ""red flags"" (free throw shooting for Fultz, turnovers for Cade) are/were seen as things they could improve."
"&gt; Cade can shoot from deep, midrange, finish, handle, playmake, play off-ball, on-ball, defend off-ball, on-ball, switchable 1 through 3.5.  I know it seems weird now, but this is essentially exactly what the hype was about Markelle Fultz.  Like replace ""Cade"" with ""Fultz"" in the weeks leading up to the 2017 draft and no one would really bat an eye.  Except about defending larger forwards."
"**Fox Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""The Sixers made a no-brainer trade for the first pick, and now they'll make the no-brainer choice with the selection.""  Tatum 3: ""Taking the Duke forward with the first pick would have been a reach. Trading down to No. 3 allows Ainge to take the guy he wants without facing a ton of criticism (and while adding another asset down the line).""  **Sports Illustrated**  Fuiltz 1: Mocking this one is like getting extra credit for spelling your name correctly.   Tatum 3: This could be Josh Jackson (who may have greater value in a deal), but the better fit for Boston would be Tatum, thanks to his potential to space the floor, play some power forward and become a go-to scorer down the line.  **Bleacher Report:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Markelle Fultz remains the favorite to go No. 1, even if the Boston Celtics trade the pick.""  Tatum 5: ""The Sacramento Kings won't be happy to see the Phoenix Suns grab De'Aaron Fox. But Fox going top four means Jayson Tatum slips to No. 5, where he stands out as a strong candidate for best player available.""  **Chad Ford:**  Fuiltz 1: ""That all-around style of play would be a welcomed addition alongside Ben Simmons and the 76ers' numerous young big men to help round out the roster and start the organization's ascent up the standings in the Eastern Conference.""  Tatum: 3: ""It will likely come down to the Celtics then picking Jackson sight unseen or going with Tatum, who might wind up fitting better in the long term.""  **CBS Sports:**  Fuiltz 1: ""Is Fultz ""can't-miss""? He's as close as there is to can't-miss as there is in this draft""  Tatum 3: ""It may prove to be the smart decision, seeing that the Celtics have plenty of flexibility in the near future. (If things break the right way, there's a chance the Celtics could have high lottery picks from the Nets and Lakers next season.) ""  Many of these were saying that the biggest issue with Tatum over Jackson was that Jackson refused to meet with the Celtics. It's likely they would have had Jackson over Tatum, if that didn't happen.  When people are saying Fuiltz is ""as close as there is to 'can't-miss'"", ""Sixers will make a no-brainer choice"", and ""Remains the favorite even if Boston trades the pick"" implies that the majority of people and analysts thought Fuiltz was clearly the better talent.  When they are trying to figure out if the C's should take Tatum over Jackson, when Jackson refused to workout with them, then you know the perceived talent disparity between Fuiltz/Tatum is more then the draft positions of 1-3, rather then the opposite argument which you are making.  Just because Ainge Zigged when everyone else Zagged doesn't change that 95% of the people thought Fuiltz had more talent."
"&gt; Cunningham also has ""best player on a title team potential""  Last ten number one overall picks:  * Anthony Edwards * Zion Williamson * Deandre Ayton * Markelle Fultz * Ben Simmons * Karl-Anthony Towns * Andrew Wiggins * Anthony Bennett * Anthony Davis * Kyrie Irving  The only players on that list who have won a title are Kyrie and Davis, and that's because they played with LeBron James. Who in that group looks like they actually have ""best player on a title team"" potential? Davis, *maybe* Zion, and that's probably it. How many of those players were better than SGA in their third year? Towns, Davis, and Irving?"
"I was going to push back on this, but I looked at the last 10 #1 picks and, you're pretty much right. Wiggins is probably the third worst behind Bennett and Fultz. Ayton and Edwards haven't made all-star teams, but it's pretty reasonable to believe they will, and it's unlikely Wiggins will.  Blake Griffin, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ben Simmons, Markelle Fultz, Deandre Ayton, Zion Williamson, Anthony Edwards"
"Dude you are way off. Tatum was projected to go #3 by all accounts. The order was actually pretty clear:  1. Fuiltz  2. Ball  3. Tatum  This is true across mocks for Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, NBA.com , Fox Sports.com, CBSSports.com, and ESPN.  They all agreed that Fuiltz was #1 no matter what the team was. In fact here is an article title for you plucked from one of these ""No matter the team, Markelle Fultz remains at top of the board.""  You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. If you were paying attention at the time, it was clear Fuiltz was going #1 no matter what because of his talent."
"Yeah Bagley wasn't like say, Markelle Fultz where he looked amazing on paper and just didn't pan out. Bagley looked awful on paper unless you just really valued his 20/10 in NCAA."
Elfrid Payton   Markelle Fultz   TJ McConnell   Ben Simmons   Joel Embiid
"Our fanbase thinks jon isaac, chuma okeke, and markelle fultz are all untouchable. We have 0 untouchable players."
"How does me saying Tatum was consensus 3-6 mean I have an agenda when it’s true lol.  [here is your link, it’s a “consensus mock draft”](https://www.nba.com/news/2017-consensus-mock-draft)  This consensus mock draft has Tatum #3, which falls into the category of consensus 3-6. Also in this consensus mock draft, Fultz goes #1.  Let’s look at [another consensus mock draft](https://www.basketballinsiders.com/2017-nba-consensus-mock-draft-final/)  In here it is the exact same. Markelle at #1, Tatum within the 3-6 range.  How about [1 more consensus mock](https://www.slcdunk.com/nba-draft/2017/6/22/15852100/nba-draft-2017-final-consensus-mock-draft)  Here, once again we see Markelle go #1, but Tatum goes at number 4 behind Josh Jackson, which falls into the consensus 3-6 range.  These were the first 3 results when googling 2017 consensus mocks, completely randomly selected. In these we see a trend, Markelle at #1, Lonzo #2, and Jayson Tatum going in the 3-6 range.  That’s what consensus is. These are mocks by many draft experts who examine the NBA Draft for a living. You’re not gonna try and say they are “random people”, right?  I don’t know what more you want. It is clear that Markelle was the consensus number 1 overall pick, while Tatum fell within the 3-6 range.  I don’t know what else to say. This argument is stupid. You are calling people who provide for their families by analyzing the draft “random people on the internet” when they have platforms read by hundreds of thousands of NBA Fans who search “NBA Mock Draft”.   There were multiple mocks you can find that have Tatum behind Markelle, Lonzo, Jackson, Fox, and Dennis Smith Jr. that you can find. I do admit those are more rare, but they absolutely do exist.  I literally don’t know what else to say. The fact that this is even a discussion baffles me."
"He was the consensus #1 overall pick  Danny Ainge went against the consensus because he thought Tatum, a consensus 3-6 pick was better than Markelle  When Danny Ainge traded down to #3 and the Sixers traded up to pick #1 they evaluated the prospects just like Ainge did but rather than going against consensus they went with Markelle Fultz, the widely perceived best player in the draft class  Just because a single person, Danny Ainge, thought that Tatum was better does not mean that draft experts who evaluated the draft, made mock drafts, and made big boards felt that Tatum was the better prospect.  How does Danny Ainge thinking that Tatum was better than Markelle mean that that the consensus (definition: widely agreed upon by a group of people) number 1 overall prospect was Markelle?"
Adam Morrison was supposed to be the next Larry Bird and Markelle Fultz was supposed to be the next James Harden.  You can never know how well a top draft pick will actually pan out in the NBA.   SGA is a proven player that's gonna get a max deal and be an All Star.  Cade may be the next Luka...who knows right now?  Is he really going to be better than a top young All Star caliber player and a top 6 pick tho?
"Here are the two first results when you google 2017 NBA mock draft, both are from 2017.  https://www.nba.com/news/2017-mock-draft-third-edition  &gt;The pick for the Boston Celtics at No. 1 would have been Fultz … and the pick for the 76ers at No. 1 will be Fultz. Not only is he the top prospect in the Draft in a consensus of front offices, Fultz is practically an ideal fit for the 76ers because he can play off the ball with Ben Simmons or in place of Simmons if the 2016 first choice is resting or struggling in his transition to point guard.  This has Jayson Tatum going to the Kings at #5 with the Celtics taking Jackson at #3.  —————————————  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/5/16/15646832/nba-mock-draft-2017-markelle-fultz-boston-celtics-lonzo-ball-los-angeles-lakers  &gt;1. Boston Celtics — Markelle Fultz, PG, Washington  &gt;If you were making a modern NBA point guard in a lab, he would look a lot like Markelle Fultz. Every tool is here: size, speed, length, shooting, and the ability to finish above the rim. What really separates Fultz is his creativity off the bounce. Sometimes that means hitting open cutters with a pass. Sometimes it means finding new ways to score out of the pick-and-roll. There are a lot of great talents in this draft, but Fultz has emerged as the **easy** pick at No. 1. The Celtics should have themselves a franchise player."
"No, I’m not.  Markelle Fultz was projected #1 overall to the Celtics when they had a point guard who was 4th in MVP voting.  I seriously don’t understand what you’re talking about."
"Sixers also “evaluated the talent” and they picked Markelle #1 overall. Lakers “evaluated the talent” and they picked Lonzo #2.   A million draft analysts **who’s job is to evaluate the fucking draft** put Fultz #1 and Tatum at 4-6.  Danny Ainge and his scouts are some of the only people on earth to “evaluate” differently at the time, and he’s a genius for that, but that does not mean consensus was not that Markelle Fultz was far and away the #1 overall guy.  Every single mock draft had Markelle going number 1 because he was pre-draft a tier 1 prospect to the majority of scouts while Tatum was a tier 3 prospect to the majority of scouts behind Markelle, Lonzo, Jackson, and Fox.  I don’t understand why you are taking what Danny Ainge did and trying to say that that means most people who “evaluated the draft” thought Tatum was the best player.   That was simply not the case. Like it or not."
"Yeah, Danny Ainge thought that Tatum was more valuable. Almost all others didn’t.  What are you missing. That’d be the same as the Pistons taking Bouknight #1 because they felt he was the most valuable. Just because Danny Ainge had felt like Tatum was more valuable does not mean that was near consensus. If Ainge had taken Tatum at #1 it would’ve been widely questioned because the perceived difference in value between him and the clear consensus #1 overall pick, Markelle Fultz, was so massive."
watch them get laughed out by everyone and get like markelle fultz for kuz
"I would put Markelle Fultz up there. An injury was likely involved, but he didn't cooperate with the Sixers, gave them very little on the court, forced a trade to Orlando to start over and ultimately left Philadelphia with nothing at all to show for taking him #1. And AFAIK has zero remorse about it."
Markelle Fultz supposedly as well
"The Magic can offer Markelle Fultz, and if that’s not enough, we’ll throw in Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but we keep Goofy."
Imagine resting your hopes on Markelle Fultz
"Do we no longer speak of Markelle ""Superbust"" Fultz?"
"&gt; you're simply being too harsh on fultz  this is a statement of fact, not a matter of being harsh or not  &gt; And yet the worst season of Kyle Lowry’s career has better efficiency and advanced stats than the best season of Markelle Fultz’s."
"I guess you forgot about Markelle Fultz, who is basically Anthony Bennett 2.0"
Did you forget about Markelle Fultz

Good news for Magic fans because he praised Markelle Fultz in the summer league
"I'm drafting top 10 in a deep draft. It's not like I don't have a draft pick and have to go searching for veterans as my only option.    I have Zion who's 21 and can create his own shot. Brandon Ingram who's 23 and can create his own shot. NAW who is getting better and better as a combo guard with starting or 6th man potential who can also get his own shot and is 22. Already have a future big in Jaxson Hayes. Also have Lonzo and Josh Hart who are RFAs we can resign. I have no need to draft a guy with a high potential like a Moses Moody or a Keon Johnson or someone one &amp; done that will sit on the bench because he can't utilize a discernible skill right away to get on the court next to Zion or BI or over Hart/NAW/Hayes/Zo.   I'm drafting the highest star role player type I can get. Someone who knows they are a compliment piece to Zion/BI. Someone who's gonna play hard offensively and defensively. Someone who has a discernible skill like shooting or defense to get on the court as soon as possible. If that's Kispert, I go for it. Might be Trey Murphy, might be Franz Wagner.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why are you banking on a rookie being a quality role player?  I'm banking on Kispert to be a quality role player because he's shown 4 years of shooting 40.8% from 3 and the last two being 43.8% and 44% with 5.4 and 6.5 attempts per game. These are going to translate into the NBA right away unless he goes Markelle Fultz on us.   He's been asked to play his role in the NBA for 4 years at Gonzaga already. Court is getting bigger, defense is getting lazier in the regular season, pace is getting faster (not that Gonzaga wasn't already fast af), shooting is a bigger emphasize compared to college.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Build the rest of the roster with vets who have proven they can play in those spots.  Sure you can ALSO do that but I still have a draft pick in the top 10 now. I'll only trade that for Dame or another star player like Bradley Beal.   Phoenix did this same idea with Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson when ""draft experts"" thought there were better players available still. But they ended up getting their guys they wanted to build around Booker and Ayton. Atlanta as well with building around Trae Young with Hunter, Reddish, Huerter, and then went to spend money on Bogdanovic and somewhat overspent on Gallo.   There's no problem with spending on vets. But I still have to utilize this pick for my roster somehow.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;There’s already been reports about Zion’s family not wanting him outta New Orleans. If those are true, then next year has to be the year Zion and his team see some kind of progression within the organization.   Relax those are bluffs. He's literally 21. The probably with the Pelicans isn't the teams talent on the floor but more with ownership and market size. If he wants out after his rookie contract so be it. I think the last time someone led their team to a championship on a rookie contract was Tim Duncan. These things take time to build.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Why would you give 23 mins a game to someone like Kispert when you can just Inquire about an Eric Gordon type to play the same role but better?  Because I have a draft pick and need to use it and should get someone to fit into the roster I have already constructed. Everyone is young still. I can go get vets but I still need to draft a player baring a superstar trade like Dame or Beal."
