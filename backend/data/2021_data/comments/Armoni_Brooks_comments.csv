"Armoni Brooks crushing 3pm like never done before, and that stud wearing #13, Khyri, is legit. Where tf did all these guards come from?! Lol"
Armoni Brooks is fucking legit
KJ Martin and Armoni Brooks are the future
"3 firsts this year, currently projected to be high lottery, 23 and 24, but that high lottery could become late first if we don't get a top 4 pick.  A heap of future picks and swaps  Cap space  A young core of Wood, KPJ, KJ Martin and JaeSean Tate  And I feel we have some promising players in Khyri Thomas and Armoni Brooks  Honestly I think our future looks good all things considered, especially if we get a top 4 pick. We're in a good place to make some moves in a few years to acquire another all star, and we have a lot of chances to hopefully acquire some good young talent through the draft. I think the Rockets hate is overblown right now in this sub."

"Rockets future is somewhat underrated.  KPJ, Armoni Brooks, Wood, Tate and KJ Martin are all guys 25 or younger.  Not to mention their absolute haul of picks from Blazers/Nets/Wizards/Pistons/Bucks  If they somehow manage to keep their pick, it’s all up"
Not as good as Armoni Brooks!
"Jordan Clarkson, Beno Udrih, that motherfucker Dillon Brooks, Aaron Brooks, Armoni Brooks...  Basically, if your last name is Brooks, you torch Portland."
"3 years ago, the Rockets had a really good offense and an elite defense. Now...they have Armoni Brooks"
Armoni Brooks
Armoni Brooks doesn't have a Wikipedia page.
"lol I have unfortunately watched the whole ass game and im mystified why hes playing so passive... the Rockets tallest player is 6'6'' and we are currently running an 8 man roster of Anthony Lamb, Jeffries, KJ Martin, House, Khyri Thomas, Jae'Sean Tate, and Armoni Brooks. Y'all should be up 30 and Gobert should easily have a 20/20 game..."
"i remember this, armoni brooks is going for 50"
playing armoni brooks 42mins deserves a fine. blatantly tanking

if kpj really out might as well have cougar legend armoni brooks run point tonight lol theres like a 90% chance we lose by double digits so it wont even matter
#Armoni Brooks!
#ArmOni Brooks!
Lmao Armoni Brooks like power
Quick like ArmOni Brooks!
Learned that from ArmOni Brooks!
ArmOni Brooks-lite
should armoni brooks be in the rookie of the year convo for playing for the local nba team?
Armoni Brooks and Kenrich Williams
"Saying the Nets package is “god awful” when most of the draft assets convey after 2023 is insane. We literally know how much the NBA changes in just 2 years.  I’m not saying it was a fantastic deal by any means but  you’re doing too much. We must be watching two different Ben Simmons.   Simmons ain’t a scrub at all but he is not the generational franchise cornerstone you think he is  Its better to bottom out, then be a team stuck as a 10-13th seed for the duration of Simmons contract. He’s not getting flipped for a haul, so let’s kill that idea.  You’re also rate Maxey and Thybulle extremely high as well.  Thybulle is an elite defender but is closer to Tony Allen/Roberson than a PG type. I mean he averages 4 PPG.   Rockets have already found great talent this year dirt cheap between KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks, Tate and KPJ.   Gonna go on a limb and say I trust Rockets scouting department to get players like Maxey/Thybulle."

1. Wood 2. KPJ 3. Tate 4. KJ Martin 5. Khyri Thomas 6. Armoni Brooks 7. Sterling Brown 8. Kelly Olynyk
"&gt; Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks  That team with ben simmons is still headed to the lottery, the team would still get decent draft position and have a three time all star point guard who turns 25 in july"
"Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Jae'Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr, Armoni Brooks"
"Aaron Brooks, Dillon Brooks, Armoni Brooks, Scott Brooks  I think Portland just gets torched by people with the last name Brooks"
Keeping our pick  Re-signing Olynyk and Armoni Brooks  Trading or buying out Wall
Nah they got bodied by Armoni Brooks and KJ Martin
"Stone honestly seems like he has a good eye for talent. In a redraft KMJ might would go mid 1st round, and Tate was a great find too. And some of the random G-league signings weren't bad either, I have a lot of hope for Khyri Thomas and Armoni Brooks"
"KPJ playing his first full season. Last season he was kinda thrown into our roster, he didn’t have any training camp.  I’m also looking forward to Jalen Green and Armoni Brooks"
I don't know you probably know more than me. I don't even know who is on the rockets beside Christian Wood and Armoni Brooks.
"If anyone cares, in my high school career I am 2-0 against Armoni Brooks. He obviously took that to heart and made the Nba"
who is armoni brooks?  i know who RDCworld  guy is
Christian Wood  Jalen Green  Alperen Sengun  Kevin Porter Jr  Usman Garuba  Kenyon Martin Jr  Armoni Brooks  Jae’Sean Tate   Josh Christopher
Solid pick but I like Armoni Brooks on the Rockets more. I think he’ll take a big leap.
lol this is a summer league super team   Armoni Brooks bout to be in the mix too
"Armoni Brooks, feels out in the cold"
"Wall, Green, KPJ, Theis and Wood as their starting 5.  Picked up gems in Sengun, Garuba and Josh Christopher.  Promising talent in Kenyon Martin Jr, Jae-Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks to name a few.  Houston's rebuilding better than teams that have been ""rebuilding"" for more than 3 seasons LOL"
Armoni Brooks
"Assuming we take Green, our team is gonna be super entertaining this season. KPJ, Jalen Green, Jae'Sean Tate, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr, plus guys like Armoni Brooks and Khyri Thomas. That team might not make the playoffs, but they'll certainly play some entertaining basketball."
Armoni Brooks’ (Rockets guard) uncle is Mark Phillips (from RDCworld).

"&gt;Yawn. It’s 2021, can’t use anything but TS% anymore  According to [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) there were only 6 qualified players in the NBA last year with a worse TS% than Wall.  &gt;I mean, if you wanna talk about why his assists were down last year, maybe start with the trash teammates he had who couldn’t hit shots.  Here's a list of players on the rockets last year who played significant minutes (500+) and had a better TS% than John Wall: Kelly Olynyk, Sterling Brown, Christian Wood, Kenyon Martin Jr., Eric Gordon, Jae'Sean Tate, Armoni Brooks, David Nwaba, KPJ, Danuel House, Boogie Cousins, and Victor Oladipo. The only two who were less efficient than him in that many minutes were noted offensive sparkplugs PJ Tucker and Ben McLemore. Talk all you want about how his assist numbers would be better if he didn't have ""trash teammates who couldn't hit shots"", but I find that really hard to take when almost everyone on the team is out shooting him.  Would his efficiency be better if he didn't have to carry so much offensive load on a shitty team? Yeah, probably. Would it be *significantly* better? I don't see why it would be. John walls main role on a team will always been as an offensive engine. He's not a dynamic off ball player, especially not at this point in his career.  If he were to get 6th man minutes on a good team, he could probably put up more efficient numbers on 50-60% of his current volume, but the fact of the matter is that no contending team is going to give 6th man minutes to a relatively inefficient scorer who can't defend effectively anymore, even if he was on a much cheaper deal."
Armoni Brooks betta
"We had kpg, kj martin, and armoni brooks in g league last season. Rockets def use the Vipers for development the right thing way."
Green and Sengun ROTY campaign   KPJ MIP campaign   Wood improvement   Garuba and Christopher balling out in the g league  Armoni Brooks shooting  Chet/Banchero/Duren/Hardy
"Armoni Brooks definitely has shooting skill and talent.  Similar to other great NBA shooters in that he’s not just a catch and shoot guy, he’s a weapon off screens/movement, relocation, and has deeeep range.  Rockets haven’t had a shooter like that in years (or ever?). Troy Daniels was supposed to be that guy lol.  As an end of bench guy, Armoni had some good games last season. But to be in the greatest shooter convo, he’s gonna have to earn a regular role and perform consistently."
"Yeah, and his name is **Armoni Brooks**"
"ROFL   You clearly have the wrong Armoni Brooks, pal.  See, look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsvHh7\_yI4I"

"I'm afraid Armoni Brooks doesn't make it even though he's a lights out shooter, while Daniel House should be cut from organized basketball all together."
I doubt it but Armoni Brooks
"**TLDR**: Shockingly enough the rebuilding Rox don't have an open spot for him b/c there are too many promising young guys, and entrenched starters + rotation players.  I know we're rebuilding and it feels like we should have an open sport for him, but we legitimately don't unless he wants to sign a 2-way(Bey and Lamb are the current ones but can be cut).  We're already down to 14 playable roster spots instead of 15 b/c of John Wall effectively being an assistant coach the entire year barring a miracle buyout or trade.   Plus we drafted 4 rookies in the 1st rd, 1 who's a guaranteed starter(Green), 1 who earned himself rotation minutes(Sengun) and 2 who look promising but are gonna be in RGV a lot(Christopher and Garuba). That leaves 10 roster spots to work with.  9 of those 10 roster spots are starters/rotation players on gtd contracts who aren't fighting for a roster spot: Gordon, CWood, Theis, Augustin, Nwaba, DHouse, KPJ, KMJ, and Tate.   Then we got 3 guys battling in training camp for the 14th spot: Exum who's on the weird incentive based contract built for trades, fan favorite sharpshooter Armoni Brooks who's on an Exhibit 10 but is prolly getting a 2 way spot, and Daishen Nix on an Exhibit 10 as well.  Including the two 2-way guys, that's 19 out of the 20 guys we had on our training camp roster since we cut Khyri Thomas, who was on a non-gtd contract, to do the Sekou trade.   In the grand scheme Sekou doesn't fit in that mix which is why he got waived. In spite of Sekou's theoretical potential, I just don't see a world where he makes the final 14 man roster over Exum w/his tradeable contract, or Armoni Brooks w/his elite shooting."
Armoni Brooks has a future in this league as a sniper. Not sure how his defense is but if he can become a positive in that area he's going to earn 100+mil over the life of his career.
As a University of Houston guy Armoni Brooks with the big shot was the highlight for me.
"It's not Theis. It's being home. They went from averaging 31% from 3 to 47% in these last 2 wins at home. Garrison Matthews, Armoni Brooks, and Danuel House have gone crazy. Without their shooting, These would be the same competitive losses as many others, just with worse defense."
Coogs legend and RDCWorld1’s cousin Armoni Brooks
Armoni Brooks &gt; Aaron Brooks
"Armoni Brooks and Garrison Matthews getting consistent minutes has done wonders for spacing. Theis being out of the lineup has had the same effect, he just doesn't fit on this team.       KPJ's best game this year. I doubt it's a coincidence that he's been playing much better now that we have actual spacing."
“The GOAT” Alperen Sengun  Kenton Martin Jr.  Daniel House Jr.  Garrison Mathews  Armoni Brooks  **End of civilisation**
I’ve been saying all season we need to release this scrub Jaylen “Not Even the Best Jaylen of the Draft” Green. Those minutes belong to… *checks notes* Armoni Brooks.
"It’s not about the wins. It’s about how are players are being used   Our young players have struggled getting minutes over random vets. We LITERALLY have no offensive sets. It’s all just do whatever you want out there. Which for guys like KPJ and Green is too much responsibility right now and they are playing awful because of it   Garuba who played in a top league in the world and paid 4m just to break his team’s contract to come here can’t even step on the court without us being down 20 points. He’s now playing great in the g league  We have the worst shooting team in the league by a mile and Armoni Brooks who is a certified sniper can’t get on the court either.   Josh Christopher our other first rounder has struggled to get on the court as well. Despite being a better passer and shot creator than most of our team.   KJ Martin just recently started getting minutes despite outplaying our entire roster.  Sengun was given 5 min a couple games ago cause Quote by Silas “Theis was playing well”  Silas is not just not winning us games. He isn’t prioritizing minutes for our young guys, nor is he setting up our players for success.   So you tell me, what is Silas actually doing well? Except for having a big old grin"

"Did someone say John Wall? I'll give the Sixers John Wall, Danuel House, DJ Augustine, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Daniel Theiss, Armoni Brooks, Josh Christopher, Usman Garuba, Garrison Mathews, Daishen Nixx, David Nwaba, and Stephen Silas for Ben Simmons. Who says no?"
Don’t sleep on the Armoni Brooks vs. Jamorko Pickett (yes this is an actual NBA player) matchup
"On a side note, I had no idea the Rockets had an Armoni Brooks on their roster.    That A.Brooks  on the boxscore had me confused for a sec, since I really don't think Aaron Brooks would still be playing the NBA today."
I’m just waiting for Armoni Brooks to get those Eric Gordon minutes once he gets traded
"Houston should probably be...  Lock in: Jalen Green, KPJ, Jaesean Tate, Sengun, Garuba, Josh Christopher, KJ Martin, Armoni Brooks  Move on: Wall, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, Nwaba  Uncertain: Wood, Theis, Augustin, Garrison Matthews, Daishen Nix  Only trade Wood if we get a can't miss offer that helps the rebuild. Theis and Augustin are good bench players for this year, but they are not a part of our long term plans so they're under ""Uncertain"". Nwaba could be under ""Uncertain"" too, but he's pretty average and his skills overlap heavily with Tate and KJ Martin. I'd rather just move on from him and give minutes to the younger guys."
Anyone else notice how poorly the Rockets are doing to get open during the inbound pass? Two really bad screens by Armoni Brooks followed by a lot of standing around in coverage by everyone else
"Honestly, he should have tried to sling it to Armoni Brooks. He's a better three point shooter and had some space. It'll come with time, they all played well."
