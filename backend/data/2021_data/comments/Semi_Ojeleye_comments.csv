"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"Jeff Teague, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson"
"Payton Pritchard pleasant, Jeff Teague unpleasant. The bench would be Semi Ojeleye pleasant, Tristan Thompson unpleasant.  I expected a leap (still, not this big) from Jaylen so I don’t really think he fits this, tho he is close. I had no expectations for Payton and I expected Semi to be getting 0 minutes. I expected Teague to be a solid backup and Tristan to be a solid starter. All four of no where close to accurate so far."
"Semi Ojeleye is a walking brick shithouse. If you're going purely based on how jacked a player is, and not skill, he's easily starting over Lebron at SF"
So you've never heard of Semi Ojeleye?
"Posted it elsewhere in this thread, but fuck it.  Semi literally had an [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/semi-ojeleye-real-life-diet/amp) written about how jacked he is"
I think [Semi’s got that honor](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/semi-ojeleye-real-life-diet/amp) on the Cs
Semi Ojeleye
"On the Celtics Sub, someone said that instead of Semi Ojeleye, we needed Full Ojeleye"
"Boston needs bench depth, but Wings... as crazy as that sounds. last year we had Brown, Tatum, Hayward so there was no reason to get a wing because 1 of them was always on the floor and most of the time 2 of them were out there. Without Hayward this year on the wing we have Jaylen and Jayson. after that the depth is really: Javonte Green, Semi Ojeleye, Romeo Langford (injured), Aaron Neismith. the back up ball handlers are Teague, Pritchard, Edwards and Waters. IT was one of my favorite players, but we couldn’t really use any point guard help right now unless we move some guys."
Oh you don't know that Semi Ojeleye is very strong because of his very loud workouts that are very famous in the locker room?
"larry  nance, even stanley johnson, semi ojeleye could be cheap to go get  just to have wing bodies"
"Why are we pretending that Crowder and IT alone got them all those players, that's not what happened at all.   If I trade Semi Ojeleye for a second round pick and then package that pick with a bunch of other stuff for like fuckin Luka Doncic, I'm not gonna turn around and say that I traded Semi Ojeleye for Doncic"
"The problem is that if Ben is really that great, Semi Ojeleye shouldn’t be able to stop him"
Garrett Temple  Rodney Hood  Kyle Anderson  Semi Ojeleye  Harrison Barnes
"I think that Grant Williams was actually a massive success of a pick. He's playing very well and has a positive plus minus with the team having a higher Net rating whenever he hits the court. On the topic of Nesmith, Semi Ojeleye said that Nesmith was ""a straight shooter, you guys will see soon."" on his stream yesterday so clearly he's showing something in practice that we haven't yet seen in game. I'm still super hopeful on him."
"That team would be one injury away from semi ojeleye being a regular starter.   I live semi and I think he’s seriously underrated by most Celtics fans, but if he’s in the starting lineup you are in trouble."
Why is Semi Ojeleye in NBA?
"Definitely the most fun I’ve had this season! Semi really went Full Ojeleye, FastPP went off, and Nesmith was able to hit a 3 and had a good drive!"
"Pony up! Him and ""Brick Shithouse"" semi ojeleye are the only names I recognize getting any minutes these days.   We don't talk about Mudiay lol"
"Theis is your starting C, my dude. Teague is at best a league average backup PG, normally that would be dinwiddie for us but he tore his ACL. With kyrie/harden/kd, we don’t really need a backup 1 guard because they can all handle the ball. Brown, shamet, and green are all viable players off the bench, and we have 3 spots that we can fill with buyout players/vets.   I’m not gonna even bother talking about “HUGE” leaps from ... *checks notes* semi ojeleye through 10 games this year, or payton pritchard. If your team actually has either of those guys getting big minutes in playoff rotations, it says enough about your team."
"Teague? Theis? both proven guys, then you have Grant, who was great defensively year 1, Semi Ojeleye, who has taken a HUGE leap this year with 7 points on 42% from 3, you have Payton Pritchard, who has exceeded expectations massively, you have Robert Williams, averaging 1.5 blocks in 16 minutes as well as being a huge presence as a roller. Then off the end of the bench Javonte Green, a freaky athletic guy. Also when we are fully healthy, Marcus Smart may come off the bench(all-defense 1st team btw)     The nets have who? Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green?Bruce Brown? Chris Chiozza? that is not a good bench lmfao. C's may not have the best bench in the world, but y'all's bench is awful"
"Robert Williams is playing 16 minutes a game on a team with Thompson and Theis and when he is on the court the team has its second highest net rating. Wanna know who’s number one? Semi Ojeleye with a +28.3 net rating, who by the way just scored 18 about 2 hours ago on efficient shooting. Grant Williams literally started and played his role well. Nesmith is a developing young player who is still figuring out defensive rotations. These guys are all playing very important roles on the #1 seed in the east. Why do you try so hard to discredit players who worked hard to get where they are? These guys put blood sweat and tears into improving on their games year in and year out yet their success is a joke to you. I don’t understand how you can be so arrogant while blatantly disregarding the known truth. I’ll say it again.   *Delete this nephew*"
"this season's heroes, Payton Pritchard and semi ojeleye. just like we all expected"
"Holy shit, that was such a fun game. And what the hell happened to Semi Ojeleye? I'm loving this dude right now. Loved the last minute there with Tacko. I really was hoping that would be 3 on that jumper."
"Michael ""Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye"" Jordan"
"Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye"
"Semi ""Third option"" Ojeleye.  Watch it, Kemba.  About to get Wally Pipp'd."
Must suck to not realize THT is about equivalent to Semi Ojeleye
And a powerhouse sniper and LeBron stopper off the bench like.. Semi Ojeleye
"He's not moving probs, but I'll trade Semi Ojeleye and Carsen Edwards for him"
Thybulle is Semi Ojeleye with a few more blocks and steals.
My Semi just went Full Ojeleye
"Horford to Toronto is pretty interesting. I don’t think we’re in the running for Hill. Payton Pritchard has turned out to be a really good bench PG, especially for a rookie and Brad Stevens trusts Jeff Teague with reckless abandon. Plus, we still have our tiny toons guards.  We need another wing to be honest. Semi Ojeleye has actually been very good this season so far but after him and the Jays, it’s pretty barren. Javonte Green is an exciting deep bench guy but he shouldn’t be getting many minutes, we don’t know if Romeo Langford will be able to stay healthy and Nesmith just isn’t ready to contribute yet (he looks fine, just needs to be in the nba system to catch up to the game).  Plus, Danny ainge almost NEVER makes roster adjustments mid-season outside of 10-day contracts."
"I’m just a fan of girthy thicc muscular jacked chad like Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Semi Ojeleye, Admiral Schofield"
"Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye"
I was feeling upset just from seeing the replay of that one. Fucking nasty fall that was. Wasn't JB also the one who ended up like straight up headbutting Semi Ojeleye and fucking up his neck last season (iirc)?? Or was that someone else
Yeah why you think we keep Semi Ojeleye around?
"I liked the Pritchard pick as well but was really opposed to Nesmith. A 20% jump in 3pt shooting in one season rarely happens, not to mention it was on a pretty small sample size against non-conference opponents. Plus he doesn’t do anything else well offensively. On the other side of the floor, his lateral quickness and defensive IQ leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, he looks like a project.   I liked Bey because he could fit into our rotation like a glove and give us much-needed wing minutes. Right now we have to rely on Semi Ojeleye and Javonte Green for backup wing minutes."
Like what exactly? I'd argue that in the last 3 drafts the only time we didn't get the BPA was Semi Ojeleye over Jordan Bell.
Semi Ojeleye
Maybe Semi Ojeleye is actually good
I hate Semi Ojeleye
I'm Semi Ojeleye
"Yeah if the Cs want to get serious there are 3 or 4 young players who need a few more years of development to really begin producing, but also some guys we need to dump off to try and acquire more vets. I think both Williams and Pritchard are the ones worth hanging onto, along with maybe Waters. Ojeleye and Langford should be part of a package tbh, Semi is at his ceiling and Romeo is a project for a rebuilding team to gamble on, he cannot seem to stay healthy. Edwards may not have a role on any team tbh."
"I need to take some time off those game threads tbh. If Tatum doesn’t get the ball, people scream “stop icing Tatum out he needs the ball!” And if he does get the ball and doesn’t shoot 100%, they go “stop with the Tatum isos, pass the ball!”. Nothing will ever please the people there. If you just read the game threads and didn’t watch the games, you’d think that the Jays were averaging 10 PPG, Smart has never made a shot in his life, Brad Stevens is the worst coach in the league, and Semi Ojeleye is a war criminal."
"“He got me,” Smart said of Ojeleye's whiskey theft from him. ""That f***ing Semi boomed me.""  Smart added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.  Smart then said he wanted to add Ojeleye to the list of players he exchanges birthday gifts with next year."
Meanwhile I can't even get semi ojeleye to watch a single one of my videos.
Detroit needs to atleast get something valuable in return. Throw in Semi Ojeleye.
"Renowned sharpshooter and lockdown perimeter defender Semi Ojeleye is all they should need for this deal, the man is a certified Giannis Stopper™, trust me guys"
"you say bench forwards, but we are fucking playing two bigs most of the time, or starting Semi Ojeleye or Javonte Green, OR BOTH.  But yeah, Jerami Grant doesn't seem like a guy who wants to be 3rd-4th scoring option."
"Some things not necessarily related to the box score that I enjoyed/noticed from this game:   The refs actually did a pretty good job. Of course there's a few questionable calls but overall the game was played pretty smoothly and it was much more enjoyable because they let both teams play through some contact. This is also partially the result of the clippers taking a lot of jump shots.   Both teams helped players of the other team up after committing fouls every now and then. I noticed Reggie Jackson do it a couple times most notably.   The amount of pick &amp; pop the clippers run lets defenders hedge with very little consequence. I haven't watched a lot of their games, maybe a clippers fan could comment on if this is something that defences exploit or if it just works too well to run more rolls.   Semi Ojeleye can jump really fuckin high if he wants to."
The Celtics will win If Payton Pritchard and Semi Ojeleye have anything to say about it
Sure made Payton Pritchard and Semi Ojeleye better against us  I’d like to see Semi get 20+ points without them
"Could he be putting together a better gameplan? Of course. But you’re basically asking him to get blood from a stone with this dogshit roster where the first wing off the bench is semi ojeleye, the only point guard taller than 6 foot is Jeff Teague, and the tallest person on the roster besides tacko is 6-9"
The tristan thompson thing was so dumb and their whole fanbase was behind it. Same with Semi Ojeleye🤔. Grant williams might be a bit of an exaggeration tho
"To offer a somewhat serious reply - it's difficult to judge the recent picks too much. For one, 2nd round picks rarely ever pan out, and so there's no surprise guys like Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters aren't anything noteworthy (shoutout to Semi Ojeleye though, who's actually a contributor). And even first-rounders don't carry a high guarantee of success.  As for his first-round picks, Romeo Langford has been injured more than not, and that's never a good sign for any player's potential. But when he did play, it did look like he belonged in the league. Time will tell what becomes of him once he returns.  Speaking of time, Rob Williams is a pretty underrated prospect. Yeah he's already in his 3rd year and is 23, but he was always a project to begin with, and this year he's definitely shown a lot of improvement with his defense. His minutes aren't very high, but that's supposedly so his hip problem doesn't flare up too soon into the season. If he can put everything he has together, he'd definitely be outplaying his #27 draft selection.  Grant Williams is okay, it's hard to see him getting a 2nd contract at this point, but he looked better last year, so there's hope he can revert (his 3P% is up at least).  It's way too early to tell with Nesmith, but he's definitely not a James Young kind of player. His career will rely on being able to knock down 3s consistently.  As for Ainge getting better results from these draft picks - one could certainly argue for that. What was once a treasure trove of picks has now resulted in a lot of uncertainty. It didn't help that both the Kings and Grizzlies played above expectations (they were seen as surefire top 7 picks prior). But in order for him to sell those picks, there had to be buyers - and not a lot of buyers want late lottery/mid-20s picks and nothing else. Ainge was definitely targeting someone like Jrue Holiday, but the Bucks' offer was simply too much for him to match.  I do think it's unfortunate so many players left the C's without compensation, such as Horford, Irving, and Morris. Rozier and Hayward as well, sort of, though we'll see how that TPE and Kemba's knee turn out. I just think his draft assets - combined with the success of Tatum/Brown -  got way overhyped."
Let’s not pretend that Celtics fans thought their supporting cast was actually decent in the beginning of the season lmao.   “Grant Williams next Draymond green”  “Semi Ojeleye has reinvented himself into a top tier sniper role player”   “Tristan Thompson is better than Myles Turner and his championship experience will help the Celtics”
Holdup lemme call my best friend semi ojeleye and ask him
well when its between that and starting Semi Ojeleye you kinda just hold you nose and do it
"Sadly in this case it is. Grant Williams, Javonte Green, and Tremont Waters are not NBA players. Semi Ojeleye and Carsen Edwards are maybe 12th men. There's 5 guys, an entire lineup, that doesn't belong on a contending team. The only real case is Ojeleye would be a fine 12th man on a contender.  There's plenty of current free agents that would be better. The Nets just released like 3 guys who would be upgrades didn't they?"
 Semi Ojeleye has played the 5th most minutes for the Celtics this year and you want to put the issues on coaching?
"See that's also an oversimplification.   Yes, ideally Tatum needs to be more efficient. I'm not going to argue there.    However, the mistake you're making is assuming players should be compared to league averages and not team averages. I would love for Tatum to defer his shots to LeBron James more frequently, but unfortunately, we don't have LeBron James on the team.   Tatum often can't pass out of a bad shot because if he passes out we get an even worse shot. He can't defer to Jeff Teague, Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.   Kyrie on the other hand, had: Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier. There were guys he could have deferred to. Instead, he took shots away from them to focus on his own volume stats.  There is an argument to be said that Tatum could offload a couple of extra scoring attempts (and I've been wary of his low assist numbers and poor body language lately), but we really need him scoring ~20-25ppg at least, even at this efficiency because we can't get those points in a more efficient way.   &gt;Does that mean you'd rather have Deandre Jordan as a scorer than Tatum?  No.   Because as much as Tatum has struggled recently:  1. His efficiency isn't bad for a perimeter player (TS% is warped by highly efficient bigs on low volume) 2. His efficiency needs to be seen in the context of the team, not the league."
"-Marcus Smart is the spiritual leader, defensive tone-setter, and best playmaker on the Celtics, losing him has been absolutely massive as you said.  -We’re trying to work Kemba back into playing shape but he’s been very inconsistent and our depth at guard is not good. Pritchard was a nice find but every other guard we have is undersized and shouldn’t be on an NBA roster. we all complained about Wanamaker last year but Teague makes him look like Magic Johnson  -Behind Brown and Tatum we have no depth at wing at all. Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye are like carbon copies of each other: undersized, dense, not very athletic, inconsistent shooters. I’ve actually liked Nesmith’s effort the last few games but he’s not ready to play significant minutes, and our lottery pick Langford from last year hasn’t even touched court this year due to injury, and really so far his whole career has just been marred by injury  -Our big rotation is actually pretty decent between Theis, Williams and Thompson. I’d say Thompson hasn’t been great though, and the double big lineup we keep running is..very meh.  -Tatum and Brown have gotten flack for ball hogging but they create lots of open looks, team just isn’t converting. Which eventually leads them to force the issue and just make SOMETHING happen  Overall it’s a lot of problems and it’s mainly roster construction. There are only 6 players (Brown, Tatum, Smart, Pritchard, Theis, Rob Williams) that are definitely worth keeping around long-term. It’s crazy how fast we went from having one of the leagues most stacked rosters two years ago to this"
"I don't buy that roleplayers are garbage excuse.   If the Celtics roleplayers are garbage, why do they ALWAYS seem to go off against us? Different players every game too.  Aaron Baynes shat on us randomly one game, and then proceeded to almost lose his game once joined our team.   Last year it was Timelord and Brad Wannamaker.   This year it's been Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard. Their rookie has already given us the business while our rookie has been forced to slowly go about his business.  Truthfully, the Celtics are still figuring it out this season, just like a bunch of other top East teams have had to. This season is no different for them than it is for us, Miami, Milwaukee etc."
No dump him to the Celtics for semi ojeleye.
"A lot of those teams listed rely on them to some degree, but that's also what their skillset are for. The Trailblazers have 2 pick and roll, ball handling, creating guards. That's not what Brown and Tatum are, they are great at lots of things, but that's not the role they are best served in  There's also that those other teams at least have other options. The Blazers at least have GTJ who can get to a pullup  The Raptors just full stop have a creation problem, as do the Trailblazers recently. Spurs have multiple ball handlers and guards. The Warriors I would say are very non reliant on a single creator, they run a lot of pass and motion heavy offence, they are reliant on them to make it good, but not to do it.   Clippers still have Lou William's, the Bucks have 3 creators + other guards that can get to a shot, the Nets have 3 all league calibre creators, the Sixers have multiple ball handlers and scorers  The Celtics have a broken Kemba, and a late 1st round pick as their other creators. They have 4 bigs in their rotation, including starting TT and Theis together. Semi Ojeleye now plays important minutes on the wing for them. This team isn't just built around two stars like other teams are, they have virtually zero creation outside of those stars"
"I just think with the amount of picks they had, their depth should be better than it is. In the post-big 3 era how many second-rounders did they have? and how many of those worked out? I know that most second rounders don't work out, but to have as many as they did and for them to basically all be bad picks is the reason they have no depth. The last two champions have had players drafted in the second round rounding out their depth: Norman Powell and Kyle Kuzma.  Like quickly scrolling through some drafts right now, in 2015 they took Jordan Mickey above Richaun Holmes and Willy Hernangómez and Marcus Thornton over Norman Powell.  In 2016 they took Demetrius Jackson when they could have taken Georges Niang.  2019: Tremont Waters over Jalen McDaniels.  The only really solid second round picks I came across, where there weren't better players taken right after, were Abdel Nader and Semi Ojeleye."
"Expectations were too high, I'm honestly not at all surprised with the struggles so far. We knew Kemba would take a while to return (and he has been worse than expected for sure but he was a question mark heading into the season), our bench offense was horrific last season and only got worse without Hayward, who would often lead 2nd units. Add in the Smart injury and 15-15 sounds about right.  There are a lot of positives to the season: Jaylen took a huge step, Payton Pritchard looks like a future rotation piece, Robert Williams looks amazing at times, Semi Ojeleye sometimes looks like an actual NBA player on the court, Theis is still Mr. Underappreciated and his three ball has been terrific.  I'm not ""worried"" in the sense that I didn't expect this team to compete for a championship this season; my preseason prediction was the 5th seed and we are a half game behind that. Losing Hayward was huge, it would be foolish for people to expect us to just carry on like we did last season without him.  I think Danny Ainge is going to re-evaluate the roster and use the trade exception in the offseason, not at the trade deadline this year. Kemba is the key to the future -- he has to either start playing better and quickly, or we *have* to find a way to unload his contract."
"Even more annoying when you remember that we neutralized the J’s in the second game, only to get dummied by Payton Pritchard and Semi fucking Ojeleye."
"LOL, we got torched by Semi Ojeleye a week ago, I know your pain."
"I think he means if you can throw an end of the bench defensive minded guy out there to take elbows, yes it is a risk for the player, but it is beneficial to the team.  The Celtics are relying on Semi Ojeleye right now due to other guys missing time, but at full strength he's a guy they could throw out there to take elbows to the face all night.  Wouldn't want to see that happen to my man Semi tho."
Semi has started the last two games. Obviously he doesn’t start when healthy but if we are missing Kemba and Smart and have to resort to starting Semi Ojeleye and Javonte Green we have a problem. We need 2/3 more good bench pieces.
We'll continue to see Semi Ojeleye until everyone learns to spell his last name and away-team announcers can pronounce it right.
I remember when Bill said if Semi Ojeleye was on the Nets instead of Caris LeVert he'd be getting hyped up just as much and is just as good
I don't know. Semi Ojeleye shot 6/8 from 3 and was the reason they beat Nurse last week
Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford are only NBA players insomuch as they are currently on NBA teams. They are terrible basketball players.
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
"&gt; has made Luwaru-Cabarot and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan valuable contributors on Day 1.  Lol... Go ask Nets fans about DJ. He's about as useful as he was last season, that is say, the entire Nets fanbase wants a new center.   Also, TLC's production hasn't really changed from last year besides a dip in efficiency.   &gt; Still, right after he left Houston after 2018 he dropped off in every facet just months after  Yeah.   He went from guarding Curry and Durant every second he was on the court to no longer being a plus defender.  That wasn't losing Harden, that was losing his athleticism.   &gt;He's waaay worse now after all that mileage and his value is low enough to where you coulda snagged him and made him a decent enough contributor on limited minutes  Except in your plan he's playing major minutes as a core rotation piece.  &gt;Harden woulda made all your promising youngins with all this untapped potential you Cs fans have been raving about into valuable role players.  No, because we're struggling with consistency from those guys on both ends.   Grant Williams, for example, has the potential to be a good player but he's a foul magnet and Harden doesn't fix that issue at all.    &gt; I've been dumbfounded by how much this sub (and the NBA fandom in general) undervalues Harden and other stars in trades.  No, it's more that you're overvaluing him.   He's an incredible MVP level player, but Harden + 1 guy doesn't win you a championship. You need to have a proper roster constructed around them.   * DeAndre Jordan is a defensive liability against key matchups - With or without Harden * Ariza slowed down too much to be a positive 3&amp;D player - With or without Harden * PJ Tucker's defence has declined with his age - With or without Harden * Grant Williams + Semi Ojeleye + Aaron Nesmith have **potential** but won't magically become consistent defenders overnight - With or without Harden * Romeo Langford has been a fantastic defender but he can't stay healthy - With or without Harden  Also, Harden isn't making guys elite on the defensive end. Which, without you realising, a lot of your argument seems to stem from.  You need to be elite on both ends to win a title. That Houston team you're referencing was the only Houston team that was a serious title contender and they were the only Houston team that was good defensively (6th in the league).  Harden doesn't win with the 15th rated defence (who would be even lower after the trade)."
I think the big question is if you’d rather lock yourself into a big rotation of Turner/Theis/Williams w like Semi as a backup wing...or a big rotation of Theis/TT/Williams w (hypothetically) a significant upgrade on that Ojeleye spot
"FUCK YOU.  You couldnt play like that 2 days ago? bitch ass pritch and Semi ""yeeyee ass haircut"" Ojeleye had to go 12/16 from 3 against us, but tonight theyre 1/9."
"For sure that’s part of it. I just mean having Brown/Tatum/Hayward all being facilitating wings made it crowded. You’re seeing Brown take on more ball handling this year because it’s not split between him and Hayward. None of those 3 guys are effective as just spot up shooters, even if they’re capable of hitting the shots, which is basically the role Brown had last year. I remember recalling he needed the ball in his hands more but there were plenty of games where he just didn’t touch it in the 4th. I don’t blame the injury on coaching or the year after where Hayward was legitimately a liability on defense. Rushing him back for the Miami series last year was also just not him being 100%. They just never got a real shot at full strength with him and Kyrie.  I think the real problem, especially this year, is missing a key piece whether it’s Tatum, Smart or Kemba (them + Brown have been on the floor together for 21 minutes I think was the stat) is having that extra playmaker spaces the floor better. Right now their drives are getting stifled by collapsing defenses and their other guys aren’t getting open enough looks or just aren’t knocking them down because they don’t have that extra guy to account for so they can crowd the paint and guys like Semi Ojeleye or Grant Williams aren’t good enough without being wide open. Hayward also helped in this regard which is why he would be useful right now, because Boston’s half court offense looks totally inept. It’s the exact same problem they had against Miami’s zone and they really need the extra guy.  Yeah the coach needs to make adjustments to the personnel but when you don’t have the depth I think there’s only so much you can do because you’re not going to see guys like Aaron Nesmith or Javonte Green drive and distribute the same way that Tatum, Brown, Smart and Kemba can."
Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard go off for career highs against us to beat us and then they go and lose to the Pistons and the Wizards?   What???
Semi Ojeleye 0-4 from 3.  😭😭😭  This man lit us up.
Raptors staff scouring through game film to see how Casey and the Pistons neutralized Boston's  two studs Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard.
Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye + pick(s) for Cam Johnson
May I interest you in one renowned sharpshooter who definitely isn't a defensive liability at all Semi Ojeleye to sweeten the deal?
The point is that even someone like my boy Semi Ojeleye can be a game-high scorer after shooting 20% for a month

Narrator: Semi Ojeleye is now Dirk Nowitzki with lockdown defense
"Chuck's point is you need to be able to attack a close out. Not every spot up guy can do that. Semi Ojeleye finally got good enough this season to attack a close out. It's his 4th year in the league. He's always been a good defensive player who could spot up, but if you ran him off the line you were playing 5 on 4. There are lots of dudes like that in the nba and simply being able to drive and pass opens up a lot for role players."
I will curse Semi Ojeleye with my dying breath.  gg
Who are you and what have you done with the real Semi Ojeleye
"Ah yes, a tough loss to Celtics superstar *checks notes*... Semi Ojeleye."
Semi “Klay Thompson” Ojeleye
When you study for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown but you get Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard on the test.
We lost to Semi Ojeleye and another dude who looks like he should be an extra on One Tree Hill.   Not the best night.
"People always compare the Js but they always ignore the best one, Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye."
"Semi ""Demi God"" Ojeleye"
Semi Ojeleye being the leading scorer of the game is obviously expected.
How the fuck is the score so high and why the fuck does Semi Ojeleye have 22 points lmfao
"what are these semi ojeleye stats, 6-8 from 3? wtf"
"Wikipedia says Semi Ojeleye is 7'10"". Can Celtics fans confirm?"
"Payton ""steph curry "" Pritchard and semi ""klay Thompson "" ojeleye"
Raptors: *exist*  Semi Ojeleye: And I took that personally
"Sorry Washington wants Semi Ojeleye, the deals off. Can't do it."
"I think that this team is better than last years ECF team because Kemba is the same, Tatum has improved, Jaylen has improved greatly, having Fournier is better than not having Hayward, Robert Williams is now a top center, we added Payton Pritchard (who is better than Wanamaker), and we added Thompson who is better than Kanter. We also have clear improvements from guys like Semi Ojeleye compared to last year. On paper we are definitely a better team than the ECF one last year."
"Randle has worse teammates my ass. Celtics played Tacko Fall, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams big minutes last night. The Celtics have the most player days missed due to COVID. Our 3rd best player has missed 26 games and our fourth best even more. That’s crazy."
In the short term yea. Eventually all these draft picks we're going to have to see minutes to play themselves into a roster spot or establish trade value. Rob has really shined and Pritchard has been solid. Romeo's been hurt and Nesmith hasn't been good enough to break into the rotation. Semi Ojeleye has established his ceiling and Grant Williams so so improvement is still TBD. Edwards and Waters are pretty much not NBA level players and Fall is super situational.
&gt; double martin  Are/were great defenders? You could gladly have Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for those two
Your Celtics had him for 8 games in 2014-15 but only played him 11 minutes a game before trading him to the Suns for 2 second rounders. They became Rade Zagorac and Semi Ojeleye.
"Starter: **Mark Blount**  *Honorable mention: Ricky Davis*  -  Regular bench rotation guy: **Phil Pressey** (hard to believe there was a season where undrafted rookie Phil Pressey played 15 mpg over 75 games and started 11 times)  *Honorable mentions: Semi Ojeleye, Jeff Teague, Orien Greene, Sebastian Telfair*  -  End-of-bench guy with only a few minutes here and there: **Tremont Waters**  *Honorable mentions: Carsen Edwards, Guershon Yabusele, rookie Terry Rozier, rookie Avery Bradley*"
This is not making me miss Semi Ojeleye.
Tatum Brown  Kemba  Smart Fournier Robert Williams  PP TT Semi Ojeleye  Pretty ass
Tristan Thompson Jeff Teague Daniel Theis Javonte Green and semi ojeleye and 2 2nd round picks all for JJ . Or we could keep Thompson and Ojeleye and deal the rest of the players for Fournier Wagner and Kornet.  Ill take the younger guy who might sign with us for the future
"Come on let me have some fun dude, life is not easy as a Celtics fan right now. Have you ever watched Semi Ojeleye playing 20 min a game? Or googled for pictures of Fournier? Let us just have the Philly sweeps its almost all we have left"
"That’s the problem. It’s not like selling a house where there’s people come to an agreed upon value and you have a vast array of people who bid on it so usually you get a deal done around that number. There are 30 teams but maybe a handful that wanted him. That’s want, not are bidding.   You can’t look at the return and say they didn’t maximize the asset. Hey we’ll give you a highly protected crappy first but the only way we match salaries is you take on shitty contract doesn’t sound all that great. Not everyone has young talent. Would Orlando have wanted semi ojeleye? I’d prefer a trade exception."
0. Luke Kornet  1. Tatum   2. Brown  3.Kemba  4. Smart  5. Robert Williams  6. Payton Pritchard  7. Tristan Thompson  8. Semi Ojeleye  9. Grant Williams  10. Aaron Nesmith  I didn’t include Fournier or Romeo because they haven’t played for us at all this year or Mo Wagner because he has played like 10 minutes.
"We need a better second option than Jaylen Brown, it's that simple. The Celtics fall apart whenever Tatum sits and that always reflects in +/-. No coincidence that Tatum was a team-high and Brown was a team-worst.  Brown is really a slightly better Semi Ojeleye. You need a real creator on the floor with Brown, and Kemba hasn't been consistent. Still hoping that he gets back to form in the Playoffs."
Semi Ojeleye
I'll give them Brad Stephens and Semi Ojeleye for CJ
"I don’t know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there’s some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn’t we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we’ve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn’t have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
Celtics got depth? Lmao what? You’re a casual bruh  They’re playing Javonte Green and Semi Ojeleye lol
Jaylen brown  Jayson tatum  Daniel theis  Tristan thompson  Robert williams  Grant williams  Jeff teague  Kemba walker  Payton pritchard  Tacko fall  Tremont waters  Carsen edwards  Semi ojeleye  Javonte green  Marcus smart  Aaron nesmith  Romeo langford
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"He fixes literally all of the depth issues for the Celtics. Team defense is a different story, but right now our wing depth behind Tatum and Brown is   - Grant Williams, who is a 6'6"" Center with no athletic upside  - Semi Ojeleye, who lifts weights but is not necessarily good at basketball, per se  - Aaron Nesmith, who has as many DNP's as GP and is clearly not ready, nor do I blame him as a rookie  - Romeo Langford, who is a ghost with less than 400 minutes logged in his NBA career and who hasn't played in a calendar year.   Throwing an actual NBA level wing into the mix solves by far the biggest hole on the roster. Especially now with Robert Williams looking like he can be something at 5 for us, if we can avoid rolling Grant Williams and Ojeleye out in anything besides garbage time, we might actually be able to get some W's going  Doesn't matter though, because it doesn't seem like Detroit is interested in trading him at all, and we couldn't really offer a package good enough to get him anyways IMO."

People sleeping on Semi Ojeleye
I went to school with semi ojeleye
"Yeah, Theis is pretty decent on the defensive end. I mean even Gobert isn’t stopping Jokic or Embiid.  Yeah wing depth seems like it needs focus. With Semi Ojeleye getting 20 minutes a night."
"You kinda do, but that’s not the main problem. Though Barnes could put Smart back to the bench giving it the desperately needed playmaking and defense he provides. Especially  when Semi Ojeleye gets 20 minutes  a night."
Center is not our biggest concern.  The biggest concern is depth at the 3/4.  We currently start 2 centers and our top 2 wings off the bench are semi Ojeleye and Aaron Nesmith.
"I’ve watched pretty much every Celtics game this year, our issues aren’t at the 5. We need a wing because we have no depth. Semi Ojeleye is the first or second guy off the bench every game.   Theis and Rob Williams are more than good enough."
Semi Ojeleye is being paid 1.7m for this season
Patrick Beverley   Avery Bradley  Semi ojeleye  Trevor booker  Javale McGee
"It's more of an underachieving roster than a G-League caliber roster. Their depth really isn't good at all and they have basically nothing on the wings outside of the Jays. Also when Timelord doesn't play Tristan Thompson hasn't been all that great and it kinda creates a hole at the center position.   Also none of their draft picks outside the two stars and maybe Timelord have really hit. Pritchard  is a nice piece and Williams looks good in spurts but both are bit players. Then you have Langford, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Tremont Waters, haven't really worked and if you go farther back and look at picks like Yabusele, Ante Zizic, Jabari Bird, Demetrius Jackson, Abdel Nader, those guys never really worked out. Rozier was a good pick but for the most part they haven't drafted well over the last 5 or 6 years outside of getting the two stars. It's hard when your drafting late in the first round every year but we've seen teams able to get valuable rotation pieces in the 20s where the Celtics have more or less whiffed."
"First: Dont trade Kemba, even if you wanna trade him, the return is not going to be good due to his contract and he has been pretty much looking like the charlotte Kemba for the past 10 games.  Second: Get rid of players like Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and etc.  Third: Get better depth by getting veteren players and players who actually knows how to play basketball unlike Grant, Semi, and Edwards  Fourth: Develop players like Pritchard, Nesmith, and Timelord because they are the only players who have shown potential  Fifth: Get a better center than TT and get rid of TT.  Sixth: Resign Fournier and extend Timelord."
"Then you didn't watch the game, because they were.  They definitely played better for one night at least.  Put it this way.  Semi Ojeleye manage to join club trilly...in 8 minutes of play time.  He literally did nothing in 8 minutes."
"The Celtics had 4 lineups play more than 10 games together (T-5th worst in the league and 2nd worst among playoff teams behind Brooklyn who traded away half of their roster midway through the season).  Of those 4 lineups, 1 of them includes Daniel Theis who is no longer on the team, one of them includes semi Ojeleye who’s recorded 6 DNPs in his last 9 games, and one of them includes Jeff Teague who isn’t on the team anymore and was the worst player on the team.   Those lineups combined for less than 500 minutes on the year."
"definitely agree w this. Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Kemba, Pritchard, Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Rob and TT are all undersized for their position, they need to get a real big that can actually move his feet (sorry Tacko)"
"Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams"
"Tatum can be Magic Fucking Johnson, it doesn't matter, if his passes are going to Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams"
"&gt;Brad Stevens is a mediocre coach and I'm glad that everybody can see it now   &gt;   &gt;People defend his honor every time anyone criticizes him and its mind boggling. He has 2 all stars and Kemba and he's barely staying afloat trying to keep out of the play in spot? I don't see how anybody can defend him anymore. He should've taken the Indiana job where his inability to coach star players could be masked by his good guy persona leading a bunch of unathletic underdogs  We lead the league with players missing games due to COVID, and Kemba doesn't play b2b's. Not to mention, before we acquired Evan Fournier, we were giving Grant Williams and Semi-Freakin'-Haven't-Recorded-A-Single-Block Ojeleye on our team 20+ MPG before EF trade...  That's not ideal.  Also why the fuck would he want to go back to Indiana?... We re-signed him for 5+ years... Besides Smart, he's our longest tenured HC in a while....  How about you lay off the drugs, and make this post when you've come down? Cocaine is a hell of a drug."
"We've had by far the most games missed by Covid, which includes Tatum really struggling for a full month after returning. Both teams have had it bad.   But also, see the title of this article - the Hawks have good depth. The Celtics do not. Depth is our problem, and that becomes exasperated when we miss games. You have Solomon and Goodwin starting; we've had Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tremont Water, Mo Wager and Javonte Green start games.  And remember, this conversation was originally about top end players, not the team in general."
Its hard for me to think of more horrifying things than Semi Ojeleye taking an early-clock 3

Semi Ojeleye
"Semi Ojeleye fits that description.   He is a good role player as long as he doesn’t have to make complex passes, dribble the ball, drive, shoot floaters, do post moves, get offensive rebounds, get steals, or block shots.   The dude can hit 3s fairly confidently (38% this season), body up opposing bigs, clog the lane and take charges."
"Hey, we have a perfectly good 3&amp;D guy named Semi Ojeleye on our bench if anyone wants to trade maybe a actually NBA player to us for Semi?"
Semi Ojeleye
Semi Ojeleye of the Celtics
"Our last five years :  Jaylen Brown, Semi Ojeleye, Jayson Tatum, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard  The Heats last five years :  Achiuwa, Herro, Adebayo  How is theirs better lol"
And every team starting Semi Ojeleye is also
"Celtics are starting Tristan Thompson, Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye. Yuck. enjoy the 1 seed Nets"
"Celtics fan, I gotta disagree. I mean we *could* get hot and beat them, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's probably like 80/20 in favor of the Sixers in my mind.   I would rank us as more dangerous in the playoffs than the Hawks/Knicks/Hornets/Heat (still have no idea what to make of Miami though honestly), but we are **well** behind the Sixers/Bucks/Nets IMO.  We still haven't seen the full-strength Celtics after the Fournier trade, so that's a big wildcard, but who knows if they will still be injured heading into the playoffs? Giving every single Semi Ojeleye minute to Fournier will do wonders, that I am 100% sure of.  But the Sixers are 15-6 since the ASB with the 3rd best NetRtg in the league, and that's with Embiid missing 12 games. They are my favorite to come out of the East, ahead of Brooklyn and Milwaukee."
"&gt; First loss, we had no kemba, smart, or theis. Jaylen brown played point guard in a lineup with Tatum (struggling with coming back from covid), Javonte Greene, Semi Ojeleye, and Tristan Thompson. We played against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela and still only lost by 8.   Fair, but we were missing Hunter and Bogi - two starters. You can argue Smart/Walker are more important sure.    &gt; Next loss was the second game of a back to back on the road having played four games in six days. You were also coming off a back to back but hadn’t had such a condensed schedule. We had just played the Mavericks and you had just played the Cavs. Tatum was having fatigue issues and scored 13 points on 4/20 which I doubt will happen when we play you again.    This is honestly just kind of excuses. That's literally your schedule   &gt; we had Kemba who scored 28 points on 62.5/62.5/100 which would have made him the highest scoring player in either of the two losses.   This is literally not even true: Trae had 40 and Tatum had 35 in the first game. Trae had 31 in our loss. Trae had 33 in the 3rd game and Gallo had 38"
Semi Ojeleye and Yogi Ferrell
shoulda gave tacko fall the start over semi ojeleye
"Grant and Romeo ARE at least solid. The other three need to be mixed with the starters or something to offset their drawbacks. Also, sometimes things are matchup dependent, like Semi getting significant minutes when we play Milwaukee.  Does that mean Ojeleye is *""good""*? maybe not, but he's in the NBA for a reason, and he's shown flashes of good stuff.  To be fair, I still wouldn't want to see Semi AND Nesmith on the floor at the same time. That's just asking for trouble."
"End of bench guys (minutes played and +/-):  Carsen Edwards: 7:23, -18  Moritz Wagner: 5:11, -20  Aaron Nesmith: 4:26, -17  Semi Ojeleye: 3:43, -17  Tremont Waters: 3:43, -17"
This is what it looks like when Semi Ojeleye is the best player on the floor for you
"I knew the whole time, no lead is safe with our third stringers. They are abysmal. I genuinely believe Semi Ojeleye could lead a tank squad to the first ever 0-82 season in the NBA, set him free so he can make history Danny"
Semi Ojeleye fixin' to drop 40 on Baylor
"You put Cade in the best position to succeed. Make Garland and Sexton both available and trade the one you get the best offer for. See if there's a way you can get a young big (go hard after John Collins) and depth that has played in a structured system (try to get guys like Georges Niang, Jarrell Brantley, Furkan Korkmaz, Monte Morris, Semi Ojeleye). Prey on teams that might be looking to shed salary around the margins to go after FAs or cut their luxury tax bills.   In short, go all-in on Cade and surround him with players that aren't going to be the problem. Also, you need a new coach, someone like Charles Lee. Hire him."
"Kemba for Simmons, who says no? We'll even throw in a lightly used Semi Ojeleye."
"It's possible to become as cut as Giannis without substances banned by the NBA. You have to consider his unique circumstances being famished as a kid, him not getting much playing time his first few years which would allow him to work out aggressively during the season (see Semi Ojeleye), and the fact that he was gifted a very unique athletic frame to add wirey muscle on top.   Regardless, the point I'm making is that neither of us can actually provide any evidence or substance to prove our perspective. It's all just bullshit."
"Stats are from Statmuse. Record was just 2-5. 27 point win at Orlando and 38 Point win at Cleveland. Knicks blew the doors off of them, but was a theoretical winnable. 2 L’s against Philly, they might have lost anyway with Tatum, but you can’t knock Brown for those 2. They cannot answer Embiid. Close game against Memphis, but role players didn’t step up with Tatum out. Brown dropped 39-1a on 50/37 against OKC, but with no Tatum and Kemba, guys like Semi Ojeleye started. Brown was 13-26. The others were 4-17, 4-14, 1-3, 1-4. None of the bench players hit a three except for Pritchard who missed 6, but stepped up and was still their second best player that night."
"Top 8 for C's that year:  1) Rookie Tatum  2) Soph Brown  3) Horford  4) Smart  5) Marcus Morris  6) 3rd Year Rozier  7) Aron Baynes  8) Rookie Semi Ojeleye  Top 8 for the Raptors:  1) Kawhi  2) Kyle Lowry  3) Soph. Siakam  4) Soph. FVV  5) Ibaka  6) Gasol  7) Norman Powell  8) Danny Green  That's a ton of talent on the Raps side. If that goes beyond 5, I'd be shocked."
Korkmaz reminds me of Semi Ojeleye in the sense that both of them get way too much playing time in the playoffs and they are both trash
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
"Semi ""Sculpted Like A Greek God"" Ojeleye"
"We'll trade you shooters Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye plus any one choice of the young guards, except Pritchard, for that injury prone PF of yours. Anthony something?"
"I'll see if Brad will throw Semi Ojeleye in, but I can't promise anything."
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
&gt;Kawhi  Had played 9 games the season prior and was an upcoming FA. There was no guarantee he'd ever even put on a Celtics jersey.  The Raptors were the only team to make that trade because they had nothing to lose. If the Kawhi trade ended up being franchise killing it was okay because they were already pretty much dead. They'd been swept 3 times in 4 years.   No other team was making that gamble on Kawhi.  &gt;Harden   We didn't have the depth to compete if we were giving up 2 of our 5 good players.  Tatum + Harden + Semi Ojeleye is no big 3.  &gt;AD   So we'd win a chip with AD and who exactly?
When Tatum gets benched in the 4th quarter for Semi Ojeleye despite being only down 10 &gt;&gt;&gt;
Will Semi Ojeleye and Grant williams be on this roster next year?
are we getting a Semi Ojeleye scoring explosion tonight?
"It's absolutely absurd that Semi Ojeleye should be seeing the court right now. I don't care if they have to trot out Brown with a cast, sub him in before I have to see that"

"Roll call for Romeo Langford, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye, Kadeem Allen, Jabari Bird, Guerschon Yabusele and Abdel Nader."
"Brad Stevens should be playing Carsen Edwards, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Semi Ojeleye, and Grant Williams 48 minutes. Develop the rookie and play guys you don't care about to save the stars from potential injury."

"Bam Hibbert, Semi Ojeleye with a coffee business and Walt Jr"
"Pritchard at 27 isn’t anything overly special. He is an Ok player, looks like he could potentially get 2nd team All-Rookie. Like that’s solid, but for a 23 year old rookie it isn’t like he is considered a huge steal. Quickly was picked right in front of him and looks better, and there were multiple guards after him that could easily carve out a better career.   Brown at 3 was considered a reach at the time, and that was a great move. Angie trading down from the 1 pick to get Tatum and another lotto pick was big too.   However considering how many picks Boston has had the last few years and how many misses they had, it’s concerning.   Great/Solid picks - Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard    Picks that were nothing;  James Young - 2014 17th pick  RJ Hunter - 2015 28th pick  Jordan Mickey - 2015 33rd pick  Marcus Thornton - 2015 45th pick  Guerschon Yabusele - 2016 16th pick  Ante Zizic - 2016 23rd pick  Demetrius Jackson - 2016 45th pick   Ben Bentil - 2016 51st pick  Abdel Nader - 2016 58th pick  Semi Ojeleye - 2017 37th pick  Kadeem Allen - 2017 53rd pick  Jabari Bird - 2017 56th pick  Romeo Langford - 2019 14th pick  Grant Williams - 2019 22nd pick  Carsen Edwards - 2019 33rd pick  Tremont Waters - 2019 51st pick  Aaron Neismith - 2020 14th pick   Yam Madar - 2020 47th pick    So there is 18 players that didn’t pan out since 2014 (granted some were bad picks but still a lot hit rate) and only 3 non lotto picks really panned out (with the Jury still being out of Pritchard). Not to mention they let Rozier walk for nothing."
"Semi Ojeleye. They win without KD playing a single minute. But idk, they almost lost to  Houston, and probably would have if CP3 were healthy. So even with KD they needed luck."
1.	Marcus Smart isoing 2.	Grant Williams or Semi Ojeleye checking in 3.	Tristan Thompson posting up
He’s like Semi Ojeleye if semi Ojeleye could play basketball
Ya’ll sleeping on Semi Ojeleye
You’re lucky to have dodged us. With superstars like *checks notes* Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye backing us up Embiid doesn’t stand a chance
Semi ojeleye
We shoulda seen this coming. America needs to see Semi Ojeleye defending durant
"My guy, you can’t forget about Semi Ojeleye “The Giannis Stopper”"
Oh God semi ojeleye is getting playtime
"the announcers called Aaron Nesmith and then Semi Ojeleye ""Marcus Smart"" on back-to-back possessions"
Semi ojeleye????
TIL Semi Ojeleye led us in scoring once
it was cool until the Semi Ojeleye slander smh
"They needed an instant scoring option off the bench and Semi isn't that type of player. Ideal role for Semi Ojeleye is PJ Tucker type of role. A low level starter who can have 0/0/0 statline but overall can impact a game with his hustle and defense. He would fantastic next to high usage player like Luka. Just park Semi in the corner as spot-up shooter on offense. He won't ever moan about not getting the ball.  Also with the Celtics, their two stars are wing players, they just invested two lottery picks (Nesmith &amp; Langford) on wing players, and recently traded for Evan Fournier. It's a numbers games, unfortunately Semi is the odd man out."
"It's starting to look like he's lost his spot on our team but he's not nearly as bad as our sub treats him.   His biggest problem is that he's too passive. If a team can get him to come out of his shell consistently he could be a nice rotation piece.   ***  **Shooting:**   From a 3P shooting standpoint, he was as accurate and as frequent as Jae Crowder was for us over his last 2 seasons in Boston, he just played a smaller role.    | 3P%| 3PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi| 36.7 | 6.0 Jae (2015-17) | 36.9| 5.9   The issue is Jae scored a lot more off everything else. He was a much better cutter and more active scorer overall. Semi is too passive outside of his shooting.     | 2P%| 2PA per 36 ---|---|---- Semi | 49.2| 2.4 Jae (2015-17)| 53.4| 6.0  ***  **Defence:**   Semi has an incredible defensive body: 6'6, 240lbs, good vert, great lateral quickness, good wingspan, absurd strength and a lot of that strength is in his lower body.    You'll legitimately see power forwards bounce off him. He's the immovable object we often play when dealing with an unstoppable force.   Last season we had a good example against the Knicks. Randle was getting to the rim at will powering through everyone on our roster. We subbed in Semi. Randle bounced off Semi once or twice. Randle stopped trying to drive towards the rim.    The issue again is his passiveness. He's too much of a gentle giant. He's great at using his strength to absorb contact, but he doesn't use that strength to bully anyone.  You see it in the stats, he has a low foul rate (considering the role we have him in) but he just doesn't take any risks [\(eg. 0 blocks all season\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ndzqlt/semi_ojeleye_finished_the_season_with_zero_0/)   ***   **Culture:**  You're not going to get anyone less drama-prone. His workouts are the most famous thing about him:   &gt; It sounded like a sledgehammer was hitting behind Al Horford's locker stall inside TD Garden and Boston’s veteran big man can feel the reverberations as he puts on his shoes. But Horford just smiles and shakes his head. &gt;  &gt; “I have a lot of faith in those concrete walls,” said Horford. &gt;  &gt; Boom. &gt;  &gt; These loud thuds became a familiar white noise in the Celtics locker room after games this season. But, by late April, it felt like the noise was getting louder. Marcus Morris’ stall is a safe distance from the epicenter but even he couldn't help but notice the decibel level.  &gt;  &gt; “Shem, god damn,” said Morris.  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Further across the room, Terry Rozier heard the noise but always figured it was just part of the perpetual construction happening around the Garden. Gordon Hayward, who is as far from the pounding as possible, was more aware of what was happening in the adjoining weight room.   &gt;...  &gt;Those booms were a medicine ball that Ojeleye had repeatedly launched into a wall as part of a CrossFit-like routine that Celtics rehab and performance coordinator Zach Markowitz had designed for Ojeleye on nights he doesn’t get into game action.  &gt;https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/semi-ojeleyes-wall-rattling-workouts-have-readied-him-giannis-antetokounmpo   So if you want someone who's just going to turn up and work without stepping on anyone's toes, that's Semi in a nutshell. But you're not going to hear reports about him holding players accountable or taking a vocal role in the locker room.   ***  The big issue with Semi is that he just doesn't do enough to justify a roster spot atm. It's not an abundance of lowlights that holds him back, it's a lack of highlights.  You'd be happy with everything he provides, if only he was providing more.  Put him on a team like Brooklyn where Harden can feed him corner 3s and he'll have vets like Green (and potentially Tucker) pushing him to be more aggressive defensively and maybe he could be a really nice piece."
Al horford Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford
"might have to include Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards &amp; Semi Ojeleye, too"
"I don’t want to be laughed at when this thread gets looked at in a year or two, so I will just say Hi future r/NBA people!  Is Semi Ojeleye still in the NBA?"
Kevin “K’Von” “Red Velvet” “Wilt Chamberlain” Huerter. Almost has as many nicknames as Semi Ojeleye.
"Our wing depth was pretty shit. Like someone else said, Fournier played like more of a 2 for us. Outside of them our wings are guys like Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye, neither of which have produced much of anything."
tell me you don't actually watch the games without telling me you don't actually watch the games  Tatum has significantly improved as a passer since the league shutdown last season. He took a huge step in the bubble and an even bigger one this season. It's not his fault he's passing to Semi Ojeleye and Grant Williams.
"And even he missed a lot of time. And Kemba was supposed to be their 2nd or 3rd best player and also missed time, and when he did play was not good.   And they had zero depth, one of the worst benches in the league. And still made the playoffs.  Low assists was due to being forced to go through Tatum/Brown only because the other option was usually Semi Ojeleye or something."
The Celtics are fully prepared to take him off your hands for NBA champion Tristan Thompson along with budding young superstars Carsen Edwards and Semi Ojeleye
Can he take Semi Ojeleye too?
The Nigerian team could be great if they all played for Nigeria  Giannis Bam OG Anunoby Monte Morris Semi ojeleye  Masai and the giant of Africa really going to increase the amount of African talent coming into the NBA.
"We get it across the board as Celtic fans.   2K won't even give us a strong Semi Ojeleye.  [At 20 years old, Grant Williams was in the 96th percentile for strength testing by P3.](https://twitter.com/Sam_Vecenie/status/1139560922647654400)   They don't have to be made into all-stars but both those dudes are stronger than Jabari Parker and Chris Boucher."
You can have Horford's partially guaranteed contract back and Semi Ojeleye. Final offer.
"I'd go as high as Semi Ojeleye, but that's about it"
Semi Ojeleye
semi ojeleye and a bag of crunchy fajitas takis
yeah Robert Williams just can't stay healthy which left Tristan Thompson as our only healthy center who should be getting minutes in the playoffs. We were forced to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye way more than we would have liked.
"Moses Brown shot 60.2% from shots within the 5 ft from the basket.  To contextualize, here are some other OKC players’ number.  Tony Bradly - 74.4  Kenrich Williams - 65.7  Mike Muscala - 64.4  Jaylen Hoard - 63.3  SGA - 61.2  Svi - 60.6  Isaiah Roby - 60.3  All better than the only 7 footer on the team.  Some Celtics Numbers for more comparison  Jabari Parker - 85  Robert Williams - 78.4  Luke Kornet - 77.8  Tacko Fall - 75  Tatum - 65.9  Brown - 62.9  Semi Ojeleye - 62.9  Romeo Langford - 62.5  Aaron Nesmith - 61.7  Kemba - 61.7  Grant Williams - 61.1"
"Last season's garbage time Celtics consisting of Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, and Semi Ojeleye. They'll win one game against the regular Celtics because Jayson Tatum gets COVID and Jaylen Brown injures his hand, leaving Marcus Smart as our only offensive option. He shoots 50 threes, hitting only 25% of them."
I think Bucks got better although I have bias. Lost Tucker but added Grayson Allen and George Hill as well as Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye. Bench could be better. Add back a healthy Donte Divincenzo and I’m pretty happy.
~~Khris Middleton vs Celtics~~  Semi Ojeleye vs Celtics.
"Jokes on you, we have Celtic sleeper agent Semi Ojeleye"
"Didn't ""win the offseason"" but we should be better than we were.  We got a grand  total of ~45 productive games out of those two. They were great when they played but:  * Kemba missed the first 15 games and struggled the next 15 games.    Afterwards he was great but he went on to miss another 12-13 games due to rest and a late season flair up.  * Fournier only played 16 games total with a covid infection in the middle.   We spent the entire season waiting to get healthy and then never did.  Schroder + Richardson and Horford will at least play the majority of the season.   Tatum + Brown + Smart + Rotation Players &gt; Tatum + Brown + Smart + deep roster guys filling in for Rotation players.   Semi Ojeleye started more games for us and played twice as many minutes as Evan Fournier. So while I think Fournier is a fantastic player, he didn't play enough games to be considered a big loss."
I remember Pritchard and oddly enough Semi Ojeleye going off against y’all lol
Dude probably think Semi Ojeleye is the best basketball prospect
u dont think semi ojeleye will break out now that hes on the amazing bucks?
"Scorching hot take to call people ""overzealous"" for defending a guy who went for 26/7/4 despite [his most frequent lineup by minutes played](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2021/lineups/) including a guy who was traded at the deadline (Theis) and one of the worst offensive players in the entire league (Thompson). The Celtics got Brooklyn in the first round and had no Jaylen Brown, no Kemba and no Robert Williams, but still took a game from them because Tatum dropped a 50 piece. He went for 50, 40 and 32 in those last 3 games...hard to put anything on him in terms of ""impact"". You can't hold it against him that 3 starters couldn't even suit up in the playoffs and during the regular season the Celtics had Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye playing 20 minutes a night."
Semi Ojeleye
"I see you've never heard of the GOAT Semi Ojeleye. Sometimes athleticism isn't everything, man"
Semi Ojeleye
"Idk look at a guy like semi ojeleye, he’s shredded and they said his body fat was 6%... I realize these measurements aren’t 100% accurate but it’s really not far out of the realm to be that low since they constantly burn fat. It’s more reasonable than you think"
Semi Ojeleye
"Fair, but the Mirotic signing was good at the time, in my opinion. He went cold, it happens.   Semi Ojeleye is my dark horse 2nd unit guy. I don’t know a ton about him, but I think Horst is super thorough, and I think it will be considered a good signing when all is said and done."
I keep flopping on Semi Ojeleye
"not to hate on the bucks or anything, but they're getting a lot of love in this thread for having just won, but they lost pj tucker and bryn forbes and they added semi ojeleye and rodney hood...  meanwhile miami added tucker, lowry, and one of the psycho twins, as well as a bunch of people i don't know  the bulls added caruso, lonzo, and demar to lavine and vucevich.   the sixers added dru- never mind.  the wizards have got dinwiddie, kuzma, kcp, and harrell and they still have beal and rui.   the knicks added kemba to their hospital guard rotation too.  the celtics added back horford, shed their weakness in kemba, added kanter, and are still in the market for a few moves.   now i don't know that all of these teams will click, but these aren't weak teams, and that makes the east just that little bit harder to roll through in the playoffs, and brooklyn is still around with their big 4 or 6 or whatever they're up to now.  and since there's only 3 contenders to list, i think brooklyn has to be the one in the east, because they're the only team that is capable of beating every other team in a best of 7, even when unhealthy (see: bucks series).  but then someone will ask why i only give 1 to the east - i don't think the lakers will come out of the west guaranteed. the clippers still exist, the jazz and suns are largely unchanged with some small additions, the warriors have klay coming back mid-season hopefully, and portland's going to have a lot to prove to keep dame around.   there's also some of those smaller markets to consider who could trip up the big teams at vital moments and influence the seeding by stealing wins, even if they're not contenders. NOLA is making moves, though we're yet to see what comes of that now they've missed lowry and paul. minnesota has KAT, dlo, and anthony edwards, and i don't rate them, but people seem to have some hope they might all be healthy and ball out. i'm interested in memphis and what they'll do with ja running around adams, and there's always some fun to be had watching OKC do their thing.   lastly there's the kings, but i don't think we have to worry about them bothering anyone, so i didn't even really need to include them did i.  tldr: east - nets; west - pick two of lakers, warriors, clippers, suns, jazz.   ps. people will also say the suns had lucky injury influenced runs. i say don't count out a team full of young guys who ran to the finals on their first every playoff run. they'll believe they can do it again and i fully expect them to be a top 4 seed"

"They already replaced him with Semi Ojeleye, and he was only a starter because Donte was injured."
"As soon as next summer, really. They can put all their eggs in the Beal basket (which I’m still not sure is the right choice), or they can add actual quality depth all around the edges rather than having to play Grant Williams Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford big minutes"
the disrespect to Semi Ojeleye... smh
Millsap to buck to form up a super team with bobby portis and semi ojeleye
"Not all corner threes are created equal. Ideally, a shooter in the corner means that his defender can't leave him, opening up lanes for the rest of the offense. If the defender cheats too far, then a quick pass to the corner means a high percentage shot as the defender scrambles to get back.  This is not the case with Semi Ojeleye. Even if he hits a three here and there, his defender is NEVER going to respect him as a threat from the corner. The Celtics were playing 4-on-5 on offense whenever Semi was on the floor, and his defender is able to essentially play free safety. They accept that Semi *might* hit a three, but the added benefit of roaming on defense is greater than the risk.  I'd also consider his defense to be average at best, but that's a different thing entirely. He's the 3-and-D player who is average at best at 3s and D, and a complete zero in all other facets of the game."
PJ Tucker replacement Semi Ojeleye
Meanwhile I’m out here hoping my team will sign one nba player so grant williams and semi ojeleye don’t have to play major minutes
Semi Ojeleye to the jazz
Would love to add turner if we could keep timelord and the core. I just dont see pacers giving him up for carson edwards n semi ojeleye :(
Don't even get me fuckin started on Semi Ojeleye
Celtics notable draft pick over the last 5 years;  - Jayson Tatum - Jaylen Brown - Robert Williams - Aaron Nesmith - Payton Pritchard  - Romeo Langford - Grant Williams - Semi Ojeleye  - yeah it falls off pretty hard now
He can’t be any worse than Romeo Langford or Semi Ojeleye or Jabari Parker
He can’t be worse than Semi Ojeleye
Spoken like someone who's never watched Semi Ojeleye on a regular basis.
Man do you have any idea how much playing time we gave to Semi Ojeleye the past few years in our wing rotation? I'll give you the answer: way too much. Richardson will be an upgrade.
"Haha so you're gonna use last year as hard evidence that the Jays need Bradley Beal? Most games missed due to injuries and covid, with 50% of Kemba Walker as our starting Point Guard? Maybe if we didn't have to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for 20 MPG, and start Tristan Thompson for 43 games, things would have been different. Our best 5 barely played together last year. If you think the Celtics were a Bradley Beal away from not being a .500 team then I don't know what you were watching."
Semi Ojeleye. About the best they can afford.
Nurse's schemes are heavy on team defense and helpers coming in at the last second.  This keeps the unit much more compact and is vulnerable to pick and pops and swing passes for open 3's.  The system is great against bad shooting teams but everyone in the NBA including centers are shooting 3's at a decent rate now.    That's why you get nights where Semi Ojeleye and Payton Pritchard can run them off the court.    Simmons doesn't really fix this issue.
"Ben Simmons for Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, Semi Ojeleye and our 45th pick this year. We can also add Grant Williams if they ask for more."
You don't deserve much credit for beating the hospital Celtics in the 1st round because you were very efficient.  Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye actually started for them in the playoffs.
"Add in Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye and baby, you got a stew going."
Looks like Semi Ojeleye has found a home.
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"Drew Hanlen, the guy who turned Semi Ojeleye into a beast"
"The biggest factor will be getting ≥60 games out of Horford, Richardson and Schroder **each**. With injuries and covid we only actually got ~60 games out of Walker and Fournier **combined.**    For r/nba users who might not know, it meant we spent a lot of time either starting Thompson out of position as a PF or starting guys like Semi Ojeleye (who started more games and played twice as many minutes as Fournier).   We should actually have a starting 5 this year and that starting 5 might even play a single game together, that's huuuuuuuge for us."
"Nicolas Claxton, Al Horford, Rudy Gobert, Deandre Ayton, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Clint Capela, Semi Ojeleye (lol), Myles Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Marc Gasol, and Bam Adebayo have all been ""Giannis stoppers"" at some point or another. Last two have been pretty good though"
"Yep, so far the pieces from the original trade (along with some added free agency pieces and the occasional conditional pick that frequently didn't convey) have been turned into 4 total all stars:  Jaylen Brown (via draft)   Jayson Tatum (via draft)   Isaiah Thomas (via trade)  Kyrie Irving (via trade that included Thomas, Jae crowder, and the 2018 nets pick)   As well as a list of players who have logged playoff minutes for the Celtics:  Semi Ojeleye  Romeo Langford  Tyler Zeller  Jonas Jerebko  James Young (not very good playoff minutes, but he did log minutes on the 2017 ecf team)   Jordan Mickey (see above)  Abdel Nader   Gerald Wallace  Jae Crowder (IF and only IF we include the Rondo to Dallas deal as an extended part of the rebuild)   Juancho Hernangomez is the latest player to find his way to the Celtics as a direct result of the nets trade, so if he is traded away then I'll have to add more lines to my spreadsheet"
when was the last time you saw him and Semi Ojeleye hanging out?
Semi Ojeleye?
"Same. Liked him since his duke days. That was a likable team. Tyus Jones, Quinn Cook, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen before his reputation, Semi Ojeleye, a Plumlee bro. They had a squad"
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
Our guy Semi Ojeleye. He has a special place in Celtics fan culture
Semi Ojeleye on the list but no Connaughton LMAOOOO
They signed semi ojeleye to a secret max
"Semi Ojeleye. He got traded To the bucks this offseason I think. Longtime Celtic, he just never did much, was never a true explosive player on either end. Also, Markell fultz comes to mind but he hasn’t played enough."
You misspelt Semi Ojeleye
"Poor Semi Ojeleye, dude is getting absolutely shat on in half of these lmao"
Did Semi Ojeleye just hit a contested mid range over Andre Roberson?
i love how they snuck a semi ojeleye jumper in there
I thought i saw Semi Ojeleye in there... am i crazy? is that Semi?
"Exactly! Andre Roberson sighting.   But yes I saw Cheick, I saw Semi Ojeleye, I think that was Montrezl in the Lakers shorts??"
Semi Ojeleye? I've heard from multiple celtics fans he doesn't dribble the ball very well and he's an inconsistent shooter but excellent perimeter defender and hustler so probably him
"Yea I mean this doesn’t really matter too much bc you’re right that they both need to improve. I would just disagree with the first point—teams didn’t have to worry about Tatum passing to the open man bc way too often the open man was Grant Williams/semi ojeleye/Daniel theis + Thompson at the same time, etc. Obviously brown had to deal with that as well, I’m just higher on tatum’s ability to grow into an offensive hub based on what I’ve seen him do in spurts."
"Bobby Portis and Semi Ojeleye are back tonight and will be playing; think that just leaves Brook Lopez, Jrue Holiday and Donte DiVincenzo on the injury list."
"Bucks look like they’re missing 1 strong forward tht can switch and hustle hard like PJ Tucker to unlock the Giannis at center line up.. Maybe Semi Ojeleye can be better? Prob not.  But Grayson Allen, Connaughton and Nwora look like they all improved a lot and looking like legit rotational pieces now"
Semi oJeleye is 1 of the worst players in the NBA. Divenchenzo sucks. Portis is a role player.   Sorry Khris Mickey and the Greek Cheeks are shitting the bed. Maybe next year don't waste a roster spot on Giannis' scrub nepotism brother. Bum ass probably averages like 13 fouls/36 😹
"Totally agree, people will talk about PJ but not talk about how thin we were at guard without Donte. That’s why I’m really satisfied with the Grayson Allen trade and Semi Ojeleye on a minimum deal to at least fill PJ’s role on paper."
"Semi Ojeleye is a cheaper, younger, more athletic PJ Tucker with a better jumper. He doesn't have the intangibles though"
"Deeper than that even. They were 9 deep tonight without Donte, Bobby, Rodney Hood and Semi Ojeleye"
Kalaitzakis is on a guaranteed deal and he’s a raw forward who just came from the Euroleague. I genuinely believe that Thanasis will contribute more than Semi Ojeleye and Rodney Hood (who is washed). Thanasis is actually a good bench piece.
"They actually changed quite a bit, their depth is almost completely different. Brought in role players to fill gaps, like Grayson Allen, George Hill, Rodney Hood, Semi Ojeleye, and a new rook 'Mamu', and Jordan Nwora will probably get more time this year after looking really strong in the Olympics. Not earth shattering moves but quite a bit of roster change"
you're exaggerating. he can become another Semi Ojeleye by the end of this season.
"Allen, re-signed Portis, Nworas been doing very good, Rodney Hood(I think is coming back from an injury so we will see) Semi Ojeleye and might be more I can’t remember off the top of my head. Oh and Donte should be back.   May not sound like much but it’s not uncommon for people to come here and look noticeably better than they did on previous teams (Portis for example).   Plus Khris and Jrue could always shoot better next time we face them, that was our issue when Kyrie went down. Aside from game 6, Middleton and Jrue were pretty bad offensively that series."
"Dude averaged 17, 5, and 7 last season on 39% 3pt shooting. If that's declining, then I guess half of the point guards in the league want to decline. Imagine thinking Grayson Allen and Semi Ojeleye are going to help the Bucks get far this year, especially against a vengeful Heat team 🤡"
Bucks bench: George hill/Grayson Allan/Pat Connington/Semi ojeleye/Jordan nwora/Bobby Portis
"Nah bro, Semi Ojeleye"
Marcus smart and semi ojeleye
"Someone on the Celtics sub once said trading Semi Ojeleye or Carsen Edwards was akin to mortgaging the future. Another person once said (in a heavily upvoted comment) that the Celtics would probably turn down an offer of 2 1st round picks for Kemba in May 2021.   Both of those really stood out to me, but the takes on r/bostonceltics are pretty much consistently terrible."
"I know. But at this point, saying ""if Kyrie comes back...."" seems like about as realistic a hypothetical as saying ""if Semi Ojeleye returns from his injury as an All Star-calibre player....""  Theoretically possible, but all evidence points towards it not being remotely plausible."
"Nah, it’s rather a frowned upon move because the general consensus is that you want to bring a guy like PJ Tucker back after how much you relied on him thru the championship run.  He was great for them against Heat and Nets. He was instrumental in that he unlocked Giannis at the 5 and let Bucks play a more switchable defense. That is crucial and they miss that this year. Bobby Portis won’t see the floor against certain match up and he def didn’t see the floor against the Nets. Same if you go down the line of Pat Connaughton, Jordan Nwora, Semi Ojeleye… those guys can’t provide what Tucker brought"
Semi Ojeleye and maybe George hill to some of the fan base
Semi ojeleye
"There wasn't downside other than not being able to sign other players for that money.   Kemba wasn't the answer, so the alternative was maybe to try and build a deeper bench with someone like Seth Curry, Danny Green, or even JJ Reddick (who shot 45% from 3 in 2019).   As for the draft - yeah it's a crapshoot, but his constant drafting of project wings who lacked traditional skillsets was frustrating. Yabusele, Semi Ojeleye, even Grant to some extent, Zizic, Bird...a crapshoot means you hit once in a while beyond the lottery, and since 2016 we legit are 1/12 or 2/12 depending on how you slot Grant.   If you go out and spend on big pieces in FA, you need to have a better hit rate in the draft to fill a deeper bench. But you can't sign the wrong FA, and miss in the draft consistently.   Again, his moves before Kemba were good. But 2019 and 2020 were both major misses, and it wasn't looking like the tune was going to change in 2021, so I welcome the change."
"In back-to-back games against Philly and the Knicks, Semi Ojeleye shot 8/9 FG% (89%) including 5/6 3pt% (83%).    In the other 9 games he has played for the Bucks this year, he has shot 5/38 FG% (13%) and 1/22 3PT% (4.5%)"
"You know what’d be cool is building a giant lead ***and not fuckin losing it the second Giannis sits***.  Also why is Jordan Nwora not playing, there is no way Bud has watched Semi Ojeleye this year and thought “yes this man deserves to be in our rotation” but there’s no room for Nwora."
"""Fall got some reassurance that wouldn’t be an issue after remembering one of his teammates, Semi “Muscles Jesus” Ojeleye, has been vegan for a while.  “Semi has been vegan as long as I’ve known him. If you look at him, Semi’s a big dude,” Fall says. “For someone like him to be vegan and still maintain his physique, that should tell you everything you need to know. I won’t sit here and tell people to become vegan, but I think it doesn’t hurt to give it a try.”"
"iirc he got a lot of PJ Tucker comparisons his rookie year. He regressed a bit last season outside of his shooting, but he's been mostly solid this season (Semi Ojeleye is gone now, so he's become /r/bostonceltics scapegoat, but he's not that bad)"
"Been the case for them basically this entire year, opponent's players sitting (either for legitimate injuries or just ""load management"") and then still winning.  We had Semi Ojeleye, Justin Robinson, Thanasis, George Hill, and Jordan Nwora all playing 20+ minutes, with Giannis as our only normal starter playing 27 minutes (though I guess Grayson Allen has probably taken the job from Donte at this point, so him too, with 22 minutes)..... And won by 28.  Loyal Pistons fans buying tickets this year are definitely not getting a good show for their money."
Counterpoint: Semi Ojeleye
Semi Ojeleye is shooting 28% on the season  💀
Semi Ojeleye is like Jason Statham in that one movie I never saw.  Gotta keep the game close to keep that adrenaline level high and stay alive.
Kent Bazemore and Semi Ojeleye were throwing up shots just to see who could miss more tonight.
"jv level sloppy from both sides  passing into the middle of traffic, blowing bunnies (semi ojeleye), bricks louder than drone strikes"
"I gotta say, Semi Ojeleye and George Hill on the floor together is just disgusting basektball"
I see you haven’t met Semi Ojeleye

It was a very fun game lmao.  Happy to see Semi Ojeleye doing well (relatively).
Semi Ojeleye getting single-triple game against his former team
Semi is gonna go Full Ojeleye against us
"Timelord's been doing this pretty often over the past couple seasons, the only thing really holding him back was availability and playing time. It's not like when fucking Semi Ojeleye inexplicably went off and had his career high against you guys last season."
Semi Ojeleye
Semi Ojeleye
Semi Ojeleye has no business playing over 5 minutes in an NBA game
semi ojeleye....i understand why the celtics were happy he left
"Semi Ojeleye, I have no clue why we signed him all the man does is run cardio and brick yet bud keeps giving him pt"
"Jesusemilore Talodabijesu ""Semi"" Ojeleye"
"""Semi"" Ojeleye =  Jesusemilore Talodabijesu Ojeleye"
"If I never ever see Semi Ojeleye again it would be seeing him to much. He is about the most useless NBA player I have seen. He is neither a good defender, he can't shoot, can't pass, can't dribble. Lets just put more guards out there, better then this."
SEMI OJELEYE IS NOW 1-13 FROM 3 THE LEAGUE IS NOT READY
Guerschon Yabusele and Semi Ojeleye were the beefy glue holding the Celtics together
SEMI OJELEYE HAS SCORED POINTS IN THIS GAME
"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
Giannis Antetokounmpo  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Grayson Allen  George Hill (I think)  Sandro Mamukelashvili  Semi Ojeleye  Scrimblo Bimblo
I knew I shouldn't have mortgaged my house for my Semi Ojeleye MVP bet.
I don't put a lot of weight (if any) into preseason and summer league stats. Lots of NBA players can hit open shots in low-pressure situations. Last year Carsen Edwards shot 47% from three in the summer league and 45% in preseason. I once watched Greg Stiemsma make like 9/10 threes in warmups. Romeo was a very bad shooter in college and a very bad his first two seasons in the league. I don't think it's unreasonable to wait for a larger sample size of actual NBA games.  Almost all of Romeo's shots are wide open because the defense doesn't care about him. It's like guys on r/bostonceltics who would argue that Semi Ojeleye was actually a good shooter because he was *slightly above average* on ultra low usage and every single attempt he had like 10 ft of space because his defender was playing free safety.
"I think the main problem is when Giannis plays the C, they need a competent PF to fill in. Portis is exactly that, and so was PJ. Semi Ojeleye/Pat Connaughton/Khris Middleton at the 4 however..."
