How could you say this?   Morant &gt; Graham   Melton &lt; NAW  Brooks &lt;&lt;&lt; Ingram  JJJ &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Zion   Adams &lt;&lt;&lt; JV  Tyus Jones &lt; Kira  Bane &lt; Sato  Kyle Anderson = Naji  Ziaire &lt; Trey Murphy   Clarke &lt; Billy  Tillman = Jax  Culver &lt; Daulton Hommes
The one who did but then didn’t dunk? I call him baby Meyers Leonard but he’s Daulton Hommes
"Honestly not sure. Daulton Hommes came to my school his junior year and led us to the D2 championships. We were okay- usually out in the first round of playoffs. He's currently on the Pelicans, not getting a whole lot of playing time."
