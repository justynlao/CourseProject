"I feel like Brandon Clarke belongs on this list, but age is probably a factor."
"Brandon Clarke or a raw 19 year old that may be as good as Brandon Clarke in 4 years time, at which point you'll have to pay him 100 million dollars? [We'll take the box](https://i.redd.it/ut315n54gbc61.gif)"
That Brandon Clarke 3 was one of the goofiest looking shots I've seen
Brandon Clarke is the steal of the 2019 draft.
Brandon clarke
Ainge really took that guy over Brandon Clarke.
"They got Romeo Langford who has a significantly higher upside than Brandon Clarke. And trading out of pick 20 got them Williams and Edwards; so far Clarke is better, but he's 24, has taken a step back this year and we'll see how Grant+Edwards develop. Too early to get overly excited about anyone in the second round last year.  We're still looking at 500-1000 minutes of their entire career across two really bizarre seasons so far for most of these guys."
or brandon clarke last year. and a few other players too.
brandon clarke and eric paschall are two obvious choices
"I'm specifically talking about trading up to draft Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman, all players who were undervalued draft day but have turned into instant contributers. Esp Clarke who was All-Rookie and Bane who is shooting 45+% from 3 on 4 attempts per game when Grizz needed a shooter   As well as smart trade acquisitions such as getting De'Anthony Melton (6th man and analytics darling last year) and Josh Jackson in a salary dump from Suns and getting Igudola from Warriors then flipping him for Justise Winslow. And their trade for Mike Conley resulted in Grayson Allen, Jae Crowder (also flipped for Winslow) and two 1sts, one of whom tuned into Clarke.  People really don't understand how much work this FO has done to remake the roster into smart young players that all fit together. Yes they got very lucky with Ja and JJJ but to get to this point only 3 years removed from Grit n Grind playoff teams is incredible."
"Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Brandon Clarke"
"On/off is how the team does when you are on the court compared to off (ie on the bench). For example if you have a net rating of +3.0 this is really good, but if your team has a net rating of +5.0 when you aren't on the court than this means your team statistically did better with you off the court. It is good for gauging players on bad teams. For example, Khris Middleton was on some bad teams early in his career in Detroit and those early Bucks teams before Giannis broke out. He always made his team better and had really good on/off which shows that even those he was on a bad team, he made that bad team a fair bit better.  It isn't just good for net rating, it is also good for rebounds. There are players like Luka Doncic or pretty much every other high rebounding guard in the NBA that gobble up a bunch of uncontested rebound but barely influence their teams rebounding. If you compare that to Steven Adams who averages less rebounds but makes his team significantly better at rebounds you can see that Steven Adams is a great player to have on the court in terms of rebounding.  On/off biggest advantage is that it takes into account how your team plays compared to with you and without you as in the end, team performance is all that matter. This is also its biggest disadvantage though so it can be influenced by small sample sizes and noise or if you have a really good player on your bench (for example Jaren Jackson Jr's on/off is pretty bad since they got Brandon Clarke)."
"Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks are both home runs outside the lottery (and they moved up for Clarke), and this year Desmond Bane and X Tillman (and they moved up for both, I believe). Also Konchar."
"Pick the Grizzlies bruv, one of our mods is bri'ish. We also have two people from your commonwealth of Canada in Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks. Jaren Jackson Jr is also very fashionable like royalty."
I have Kyle Anderson and Brandon Clarke üò¨
Say his name... Brandon Clarke
"Hey man, great post. Here are the best current Canadian players by province (unfortunately this only covers 4 provinces):  Ontario: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 21.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 6.2 APG, 50.5 FG% (Honorable mention : Jamaal Murray)  Quebec: Chris Boucher 16.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.5 BPG, 72.9 True Shooting % (Honorable mention : Lu Dort)   British Columbia: Brandon Clarke 13.2 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG  Saskatchewan: Trey Lyles  7.3 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 1.1 APG (Has only played 7 games so far so the above numbers are his career averages)"
"Brandon Clarke is a great help defender, Chris Boucher is a great shot blocker, Cory Joseph is a great perimeter defender, Thompson gives effort, I think defense is actually their strength"
"I might go with Dwight Powell over Brandon Clarke. Plus Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles, Karim Mane, Mychal Mulder off the bench"
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"That Memphis pick had much more speculative value than it did actual value. I got shat on in the Celtics sub for saying it should've been traded for something.  I think Ainge should've been more willing to take high-floor, low-ceiling prospects. I get that you're loaded on the wing for starters, but you all could've had Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane to be your frontcourt second unit and would've been ready to contribute."
"it‚Äôs wild how everyone last year was like ‚Äúwow Brandon Clarke is great, who could‚Äôve possibly guessed‚Äù and it was like, a lot of people! A lot of folks guessed!"
If not for Brandon Clarke his jumper would be the wildest on the team. His jumper has such a pronounced hitch to it
"Good god that Brandon Clarke three was like staring directly into the sun, is everybody ok?"
Brandon Clarke Jumpshot: ok
"&gt;lauded for it's depth  It's not as deep as 2018 or 2019.  2019 had Zion, Ja, De'andre Hunter, Coby White, Hachimura, Garland, Reddish, Cam Johnson, Herro, NAW, Brandon Clarke, Paschall, THT, Matisse, PJ Washington, Kevin Porter Jr"
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
Seems like a good dude but oh man the Spurs could've nabbed Brandon Clarke instead of him
"We actually shoot a lot of floaters too. Ja, Tyus Jones, Brandon Clarke, Grayson Allen, and kyle Anderson all like those little push shots. JV does a lot of post fades too avoiding contact"

Wtf has happened to Brandon Clarke?
"Yes, drafting a role player at 9 is fine. However, we drafted him as a best player available instead of filling a need. Someone like a Brandon Clarke would have been a much better fit if we were truly building around Beal and going for a role player."
"Probably Grizzlies.  Ja, JJJ, Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Bane, Brooks and JV. I might be forgetting someone but that‚Äôs about it lol"

"I think Ainge really missed out the opportunity over the past few years to go for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary guys who can keep the bench unit afloat either Tatum/Brown are sitting. You all passed on Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane in favor of one-way players."
"They really do, but I'll be the first to admit that I've never been impressed with Romeo at all and I watched him at IU.  He's been banged up ever since he's been in the NBA and he has a broken shot form. Boston fans will tell you he's a plus defender but Boston's entire bench is 1-way defensive players (Langford, Grant Williams, Ojelye) and their offense tanks when either Tatum or Brown aren't in the rotation.  Hindsight's 20/20, but if they have their star wings already drafted they should've went for some high-floor, low-ceiling complimentary options in the draft like Brandon Clarke and Desmond Bane."
No but if you sort by FGA against bron on stats.nba hes been mainly contesting derizan but then guys like keldon Johnson kyle anderson Brandon Clarke etc
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
"Man he'd be a perfect fit next to Ja and JJJ  I think the best we could give em would be Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, and a bunch of picks which probably isn't gonna scratch that itch."
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
"Brandon Clarke stepped up in Ja‚Äôs absence. Been killing it for my fantasy team, too."
"What kind of roster? Ja, JJJ, and Brandon Clarke? He‚Äôd fit really well.  Memphis doesn‚Äôt have their players back yet but they‚Äôll be really good."
I tuned in during the 4th quarter just to see my man Killian Tillie on the bench. He‚Äôs one of my favorite players from Gonzaga and I was so sad when he went undrafted. He was injured a lot in college and that really affected his draft stock... but I‚Äôm stoked Memphis picked him up and he‚Äôs back with his old teammate Brandon Clarke. That was a really exhilarating last few minutes. I‚Äôll always root for Memphis because of those two guys. So glad you guys won tonight!

I was just suggesting Brandon Clarke! He‚Äôs the only fit that made any sense to me
"In 5 years, Brandon Clarke. Now? I dunno."
"I mean, this is more spitballing, but  Brandon Clarke on the grizzlies I think hits a lot of the same boxes"
Why do i see Brandon clarke
"Yeah, we seem to get all the great players that analyst over look for due to wingspan. Bane and Brandon Clarke for example"
"He's basically Brandon Clarke for this year's draft. If literally every stat you can find says ""hey this guy is fucking awesome"" and you don't draft him because his measurables or jumper don't look perfect you're insane."
"I think Ainge has kind of shit the bed in the past few drafts tbh.  It's early to call on a lot of the players yeah, but last year you all passed on Thybulle, Sekou and Brandon Clarke.  This year it was Nesmith for any of the other wings and I think you all made a mistake trading the 30th pick when Desmond Bane was still on the board."
Someone told him at halftime that Dhillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke were Canadian and decided to pull out the patented Toronto Tumping Turnaround jumper
"Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, and Dillon Brooks all have negative wingspans"
"Grizz. They have a solid underdog history with Grit and Grind and a promising future with Ja, Jaren, Brandon Clarke, &amp; Co. They have been intertwined with an underdog city in Memphis, and are deeply involved in community institutions like St. Jude, Stax Academy, National Civil Rights Museum, a charter school, and mentoring inner city youth. Its a great organization with a good group of players."
"I don‚Äôt think you can make a definitive proclamation. Which is why I criticized you for saying it‚Äôs definitively Pritchard based of him looking like a solid rotation player in 7 games.   A better example would be, do you think Brandon Clarke will be better than Tyler Herro? Because Clarke was better in his rookie year than Herro was in his."
"Shai, Murray, RJ, Wiggins, Tristian Thompson with Dillon brooks and Brandon Clarke off the bench"
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.   But I‚Äôd say we have better basketball players than baseball players right now. Thanks to Vince Carter‚Äôs popularity in the 2000‚Äôs and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there‚Äôs way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there‚Äôs:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
"&gt; Brandon Clarke was gonna be the steak of the draft  Given his draft position, more like a rump roast."
"Well he ratios Chris Vernon every single week on the mismatch so that probably helps his reputation too.   KOC is pretty damn good as an nba analyst and overall media talking head but he ain‚Äôt gonna be perfect.   When KOC was saying Luka was by far the best player in the draft and it would be a mistake to draft Ayton or bag key over him were you giving him his credit? How about when he said Brandon Clarke was gonna be the steak of the draft before the 2019 draft and he ended up having a top 3 rookie season   KOC is good, not perfect"
I was dead set on Brandon Clarke even before we traded down. Instead we got both Cam and Dario and I could not be happier.
Imagine if we drafted Brandon Clarke at 19 instead of Luka Samanic
"GM's still haven't learned that lesson either.  Take a look at Brandon Clarke, who fell to #21 last year and then got traded for the #23 pick+a 2nd rounder.  **Brandon Clarke Senior Year Stats** (Technically Junior Redshirt year)  * **Offense**    * 16.9 PPG       * 69.3 eFG%       * 69.9 TS%    * 3.1 ORPG    * 1.5 TO/g * **Defense**    * 3.2 BPG    * 1.2 SPG    * 5.5 DRPG * **Advanced**    * .337 WS/40    * 16.3 BPM    * Fun Fact: As many Blocks as Misses (117 Total)  And when he came to the NBA, he proved that he could take it to the next level.  Last year, Brandon Clarke lead all rookies in WS with 5.0.  His OWS put him in the range of CJ McCollum, Joel Embiid, and Brandon Ingram.  His True Shooting% of 66.3% in his **fucking rookie season** lands him at #5 in the NBA between Jarrett Allen and John Collins.  He's struggling this year, but he'll pick it back up.  I am curious though on when GM's will learn that a college senior does not mean they are weak prospects."
"Murray/SGA/Wiggins/RJ/Olynyk(or Boucher?) with guys like Dort, CoJo, Dwight Powell, Brandon Clarke is actually a decent lineup. That could be a playoff team in the East. Not bad, Canada."
"Grizzlies payroll in general is pretty good. Next year, they should have around $10 million in cap space, and the only player on an expiring deal is Gorgui Dieng. In 2022/23, they'll have Dillon Brooks, Ja Morant, Melton, Brandon Clarke, John Konchar, Desmond Bane, Jontay Porter, and Xavier Tillman signed. For a combined $45 million.   A lot of that unused cap space will probably be used to re-sign dudes like JJJ, Winslow, Tyus Jones, etc. But I feel like that's a pretty good group of players to have for relatively cheap."
grizz. i like their throwbacks and I wanted Brandon Clarke in the draft - we passed on him at least twice
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."

And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
"Memphis.  Ja, JJJ, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tillman.  My goodness."
"It's really tough to say because like I said, it's a real lost art. If you sort by cutting action frequency, everyone ahead of Bruce Brown is a PF/C (which means their cuts are usually just coming from the paint area while Brown has to time his cuts from way further out usually). Juan Toscano-Anderson caught my eye from watching random Warriors games but I haven't seen enough to know if he's consistently great at it and I have similar observations about Brandon Clarke and Jae'Sean Tate but Warriors, Grizzlies, and Rockets fans can probably really tell it better than I can from watching the occasional League Pass games of each team."
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
"You're neglecting a few of those:  2016 Dallas 1st: Yabusele. That was an intentional draft and stash for Horford but my God that pick essentially went to waste. I imagine he could've gotten some better future assets for a first that was right outside of the lottery. A lot of great players went late in the first round of that draft.  2019: I've watched Langford since IU and I'm not convinced he'll amount to anything. He can't shoot for shit and he's injury prone. They drafted Thybulle and gave him away to Philly for some seconds. Grant Williams is meh.  2020: I'm willing to give Nesmith a benefit of the doubt and Payton has been a big relief, but giving away Desmond Bane sucks.   Ainge had what, 6 FRPs within the last 3 drafts? Especially with those being later picks, I think he should've gone all-in on older players ready to contribute. Brandon Clarke was absolutely worth a lottery selection in 2019. Letting some experienced players in Thybulle and Bane walk were dumb decisions.   And it goes without saying that both the Sac and Memphis firsts had much more speculative value than actual value. I got eviscerated in the Celtics sub for suggesting that the Memphis pick should've been traded.   Should the Celtics have gone all-in for a superstar? Probably not - they got their MJ and Pippen duo with the Jay's and that's worth keeping. But, Ainge has squandered the rest of the assets in trying to surround his stars with proper players."
Yeah I think if you include Brandon Clarke with picks now you might be entering territory where Orlando would listen(although not sure if the Clarke in Orlando fit really works).
"Keldon Johnson, Brandon Clarke, KPJ (when taking about pure talent)"
Brandon Clarke
Haha I feel it man. I have Brandon Clarke on my fantasy team and he‚Äôs been producing for me. Such a stud
Please get Brandon Clarke to New Orleans
Brandon Clarke elbowed him in the back of the head and JJ‚Äôs something like 4/5 from 3 ever since
"Ja Morant is becoming one of my favorite players to watch. I‚Äôve been tuning into a lot of Grizzlies games this season because I‚Äôm a huge Gonzaga fan and they drafted Brandon Clarke, plus they signed Killian Tillie to a two way contract after he went undrafted this past year. They also signed David Stockton to their G-League team. So they‚Äôve won the hearts of many Zags fans. But watching Ja has been fun as hell. He‚Äôs so damn explosive."
"&gt; 2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)   Keldon Johnson's really the guy I regret missing out on at the end of the 2019 first round. Clarke had a great rookie season, but if his jumper is broken that could be a problem and Thybulle's got a long way to go too. I'm not willing to give up on Langford yet either; he's just been star-crossed by injuries."
Brandon Clarke had his hands full of meat tonight dude was bbq chicken eaten by Zion
"Hindsight's 20/20 but Ainge missed hard on drafting the past two years.  If you have your established trio of Tatum/Brown/Smart then he should've been more receptive to drafting older prospects who could've contributed immediately.  2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)  2020 - Traded away Desmond Bane. Saddiq Bey is obviously shining right now but I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt. As an IU fan I have no idea why Romeo Langford was a lottery pick. He's barely played and the best value he'll ever have to Boston is being traded for Harrison Barnes.  Honorable mention - Guerschon Yabusele at #16 in 2016 over literally anybody else (Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Malcolm Brogdon, Dejountae Murray)"

"Or just hit decently on the middle-of-the-road draft picks lmao.   It's obviously a hindsight take, but Ainge could've drafted Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, Saddiq Bey and Desmond Bane over the past few years. If you've established your core with Tatum/Brown/Smart then there's no reason not to take a chance on older prospects who could contribute immediately."
"Sorry if we are going into pure drafting, and nothing in regards to fit or retaining players OKC blows everyone out of the water, even the Spurs. OKC has drafted 3 MVPs in 3 consecutive seasons. Not only that, look at some guys like Ibaka, Sabonis (trade on draft night), Brandon Clarke, Adams, Reggie Jackson, Eric Bledsoe, Big baby Davis, Luke Ridnor, Carl Landry, Corey Maggete, Nick Collison"
"Great game by the decimated Grizz. Down 7 or 8 players, really missing Jaren, Brandon Clarke, and Melton."
"Congratulations, Lakers. You came out not wanting to play basketball and we scorched you 22-2.   Then the referees decided to get involved.  It shouldn't take 29 to 8 free throws for the reigning champs to hang with the Grizzlies playing without JJJ, Justise, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, Deanthony Melton, Sean McDermott, and Killian Tillie."
Grizzlies Injury Report  Jaren Jackson Jr OUT  Brandon Clarke OUT  De'Anthony Melton OUT  Justise Winslow OUT  Desmond Bane OUT  Lovely.
"Really interesting how certain picks have huge bumps in value when compared to neighboring picks. 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 24th. 7th was no surprise to me given Steph (even though the chart's from 2014), but also has guys like Luol Deng, Eric Gordon, Rip Hamilton, Chris Mullin. 9th is loaded with Dirk, Amar'e, Shawn Marion, DeMar, Iggy, Kemba. 10th has Paul Pierce, Paul George, Joe Johnson, CJ McCollum, Brook Lopez. 13th already looks good recently given Herro and Booker, but also has Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine and of course Kobe. Good spot to draft a SG I guess.  18th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th seem a bit random. 18th has above-average role players/1-time All-Stars with BJ Armstrong, David West, JR Smith, Eric Bledsoe. 21st has Michael Finley and Rajon Rondo, and I like Brandon Clarke and Tyrese Maxey from recent classes. 23rd is represented mostly by Tayshaun Prince. 24th has Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Serge Ibaka, and Derek Fisher.  I wonder if there's actually added value to holding these specific picks in that they are often the beneficiary of teams above them passing on certain types of talent. The ones towards the end of the 1st could also benefit from being typically selected by the league's better teams, meaning those picks go into higher-functioning organizations that are able to properly support their draft picks, and also likely have specific holes for their 1st round pick to fill in a mostly constructed roster.  It's also possibly that there's simply not enough compiled league data to truly draw conclusions about any of these outliers. They could possibly all fall back to the mean given like 50 more years of the NBA."
Brandon Clarke would like to have a word.
"Extending Wiggins and then trading away the Markannen pick and Zach Lavine for Jimmy Butler fucked them over.  And then trading up for culver when they could have stayed put and got pj washington, brandon clarke, or tyler herro."
"Grizz were already without Jaren and Winslow. Now they are also without Brandon Clarke and NET rating stud Deanthony Melton, as well as 3 other injuries (a total of 7 Grizzlies out tonight).  If the bad Dillon Brooks shows up, it will be another big L for the Grizz."
Nah lol stop this. Our front court gets slaughtered.  And you missed Brandon Clarke who is probably our best long term player there.
"I mean the two players picked after him are better and younger and the player people expected them to pick (Brandon Clarke) is as well. Nobody thought he was going to be useless, just that he was a luxury pick for a team that needed more than that."
"How good would a team.made up of just Canadians do?  Murray, Dort, Boucher, Birch, Wiggins, TT, Olynyk, Shai, RJ, Dillon Brooks,Brazdeikis,  Brandon Clarke, Nate Darling, CoJo, Powell, Mychal Mulder, NAW?"
"Grizz have been an absolute wrecking crew against some of the top teams in the East lately. Last night and tonight were without JJJ and Winslow obviously, but also without De'Anthony Melton and Brandon Clarke, two of the Grizzlies' top pieces of the second unit. Some really impressive stretch finally to 3+ games above .500 for the first time since they were 9-6  Also Grayson Allen went absolutely bonkers tonight on top of Dillon Brooks looking fantastic and uncharacteristically unselfish"
Brandon Clarke is going to be around for a long time. Book it.
Rui&gt;Brandon Clarke.
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
üòÇ  Brandon Clarke got a Canadian nickname too?
And Brandon Clarke and Melton only played 8 minutes before Dwight landed on him
"And the Grizzlies are without Jaren Jackson Jr and Justise Winslow? Tonight we also didn‚Äôt have Deanthony Melton or Brandon Clarke, super important Rotation players"
"Yeah he's the more recognizable name for the point I'm making, but yeah tonight we were missing Deanthony Melton and Brandon Clarke as well, and they each are definitely more important to our rotation than Winslow.  But point being, we've been injured all year, I'm really proud that we continue to fight for the play ins regardless"
Brandon Clarke looks like the black Brandon Novak and vice versa.
Mo ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù Bamba had his legacy SAVED by Brandon Clarke sinking this dagger
"&gt;The selection itself is worse than the actual trade  You have to take into account context.  Pretty much every draft expert thought that after Zion and Ja there was a sharp drop off and then another sharp drop off after Barrett.  Everyone after that was a question mark which is why trading up is such a headscratcher.  &gt;Do you know what it was about Culver your front office liked so much?  Decently athletic wing with potential as a swiss knife type of player.  He was definitely raw though and needed good guidance to succeed.  He was projected as a top 10 pick so it wasn't just Wolves that thought he could be good.  Rosas forgot one crucial element tho, Minnesota can't develop player worth for shit.  Should've just taken someone that's already a polished product (Brandon Clarke) or someone with defined strengths and weaknesses to build on."
"I mean yeah he's hit well on his top 10 picks but I think he really flubbed the past two drafts.   Cap-wise he put the Celtics into a position with maxing Kemba that meant they couldn't make any real trades (no tradeable contracts for salary matching). If you have your core of Kemba/Smart/the Jays then he should've doubled down more on drafting older, ready-to-contribute guys like Payton Prichard.   He traded away both Matisse Thybulle and Desmond Bane, hard pills to swallow. Also Romeo Langford has bust potential written all over him; I would've taken Brandon Clarke in a heartbeat."
Or he could be like Brandon Clarke and be basically the same guy next year since he's already 23.
Don't forget the massive steal we got with Brandon Clarke at #21
"It's tough but I think it's because Grayson can shoot the 3. Melton does a bit of everything, and last season he, Tyus Jones, Brandon Clarke were great as a second unit. Maybe they wanted to preserve that chemistry. But part of the season there were times he didn't even play. I think that was because the FO knew how solid he was and wanted to know what else they had on the team.  DA deserves to be a top 8 rotation guy."
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
Brandon Clarke is one
"I think they would have to get rid of Dlo if they got cade. Way too many dudes who shoot the ball so much isn't going to work out. Especially on a really young team like the wolves  Beasley AE Cade ? Towns  Also the wolves are gonna have to start letting some of these young guys go. Too many young guys on this team aren't going to allow for them to get out of the gutter. You need guys that know their role in order for the players you actually value long term to blossom and be those players you envision. Too many young guys on a team is just going to leave a lot of problems of fit with guys not knowing their roles as a player yet.  If the wolves got cade I would shop Dlo, okogie, and culver for a good defensive forward that can play next to KAT. Just off the top of my head OG or Brandon Clarke make sense but would require trading for them. I think Thad, Jeff Green, and DJJ can all be fa's next year depending on opt outs so maybe overpaying for those guys would also be an option although it depends if they actually do hit fa.  And just getting players that know their role and aren't going to be taking shots away from the guys you care about long term which is cade AE and kat.  Some vets along with rubio would be nice too."
Josh Hart + Steven Adams  Brandon Clarke + first round pick  Duncan Robinson + first round pick
BRANDON CLARKE  Dude is still elite FG% and now has added blks and stls to his game.
Brandon Clarke too. This is shaping up to be a fun team no lie üòÖ
Brandon Clarke too
BRANDON FUCKING CLARKE
Brandon Clarke
Brandon Clarke as Point Forward is a hilarious idea. He‚Äôs about as far from a playmaker as it comes passing and dribbling.
"He and Brandon Clarke may have to tailor the sleeves of their sweaters, but it‚Äôs still dumb as hell either fell as far in the draft as they did"
brandon clarke (memphis grizzlies)
"We have a big glut of guys in that 2/3 spot. Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen, Desmond Bane, and DeAnthony Melton are all fighting for minutes in that area. And each of them has shown that they deserve minutes.   It's one of the things this Grizz team has going for and also against it. We have a lot of good, but not great players. Ja and Jaren are our only 2 great players. The rest of the team is filled in with legitimately GOOD basketball players. But it's hard to find them all minutes. Like every team would love to have these guys, especially on their current salary, but they can only take us so far. So I'm hoping that we can either find one of these guys to be the 3rd star player, or we package a few of these guys and picks for another potentially great player.   I'm not sure how far it goes, but a package of Brandon Clarke, dealer's choice of Melton/Bane/Allen, salary filler, and 2 first round picks might be enough to get us someone else to be the dynamic wing we still need.   A starting lineup of Ja, Dillon Brooks, ""hypothetical traded for player"", JJJ, and Valanciunas/Xavier Tillman would be an excellent lineup for this team to go forward with."
"Canada could have a good ass team.   Jamal Murray / RJ Barrett / Andrew Wiggins / Dwight Powell / Chris Boucher with Shai, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Kelly Olynyk, Trey Lyles, Khem Birch is a hella respectable team."
"His nickname in Grizz circles is ""Mr. Do Something"". He has insane advanced metrics.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/1/23/21077806/memphis-grizzlies-deanthony-melton-brandon-clarke-draft  &gt;But there is still something profound happening when he checks in. Melton isn‚Äôt dominating by scoring a lot of points. He‚Äôs doing a lot of subtle things on both ends of the floor‚Äîguarding the opposing team‚Äôs best scorer, disrupting the flow of their offense, and then moving the ball and finding the open man when the Grizzlies are on offense. Melton is an incredibly smart player who seems to always be thinking one step ahead of everyone else.  His NET rating for ON/OFF stats is +17.3. He is shooting an amazing 43% from 3 on 4 attempts per game after never being known as a knockdown shooter. He has a huge wingspan and is a great wing defender due to it. He's just a guy who gets it done."

"Yeah they‚Äôre the deepest team imo. They have 7 pretty good players off the bench.   Tyus Jones is one of the best backup PGs in the league.   DeAnthony Melton is probably one of the best defensive guards in the league, add in his secondary playmaking and much improved shooting, and he should be starting.   Justise Winslow is struggling offensively but he is great defensively. Very versatile too.   Desmond Bane is the best shooter in the rookie class. He‚Äôs a good defender and secondary ball handler as well. Awesome player.   Brandon Clarke was first team all rookie last year. He‚Äôs a monster rim runner with excellent touch and great defense.   JJJ might be the best player on the Grizzlies once he‚Äôs healthy.   Xavier Tillman is another excellent rookie, he‚Äôs impossible to score on in the paint, he‚Äôs a great passer, and the shooting is better than expected.   That‚Äôs crazy"

Oh and for the homer pick, Nerlens Noel is a huge reason why the Knicks have one of the best defenses in the league, but he's not gonna sniff an All-Defense Team sadly."
"The Grizzlies were keeping up pretty well but just looked like they got so tired in the second half. I don‚Äôt blame them ‚Äî last night was the last game of a 7 game/11 day road trip for them. When these two teams played each other at the beginning of the Grizzlies road trip the game was much closer, going into double overtime with Denver winning by 2 points. Ja Morant has some amazing moves for finishing at the rim. Brandon Clarke looked good on defense.  The obvious things to point out about the Nuggets are how amazing Jokic is, and MPJ‚Äôs awakening. Mpj scored 31 last night after getting a new career high 39 points in their last game vs the Rockets. Last night Paul Millsap was the man. Looking at the box score he‚Äôs only credited for one steal but he definitely had a hand in at least one other one. He was also hitting some pretty clutch shots. Jokic had a full court pass to Austin Rivers for an easy two points. Aaron Gordon has been a revelation. He‚Äôs thriving on this team.   MPJ‚Äôs younger brother Jontay is on the Grizzlies. He got put in at the very end for the last 4 or 5min. But J Porter was fouled on a 3pt shot and made all 3 freethrows. MPJ was smiling at him from the bench. It was a sweet moment.  Next play Bol Bol got fouled. Made both his freethrows. The crowd was chanting MVP, lol. He also had a crazy dunk to end the game. His teammates and the crowd were loving it."
"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
&gt;I would guess we are going to be starting Brandon Clarke at C.  That's honestly kind of surprising. KO isn't particularly strong but he's a solid as hell starting C.
"I know you're joking but Khem is really our only jacked big man. Chris Boucher is a twig, KO isn't very strong, Dwight Powell is kind of a tweener. And it's not like Khem is overly tall, he's just very beefy.  I would guess we are going to be starting Brandon Clarke at C."
"Seems like the consensus among the advanced and impact metrics say Luka's about 2-4 wins better than Trae right now. Now that's ignoring fit and team building so who knows, but they'd likely be close to the 3 seed. The problem for Atlanta is really Reddish, sure you'd take Doncic now obviously, but they still got a very good player in Trae. Adding the 10th pick could have been enough to make the value pretty darn close, say they drafted Cam Johnson instead, or Brandon Clarke, but Reddish has been a negative so far."
"I was mentally prepared to choke this away too, and was pleasantly surprised.  But guys Brandon Clarke had been completely ass the last few weeks and where the fuck is Tyus Jones?!"
"Crazy the type of misinformation that floods the internet in the immediate aftermath. Last night, I heard his family was injured, Brandon Boston died, and now a report from last night sourcing a police spokesman that the driver of the car Clarke collided with died.   Simply irresponsible."
"1. SGA 2. Murray 3. Wiggins 4. Barrett 5. Boucher 6. Dort 7. Thompson  I know nothing about Brandon Clarke so I‚Äôm just not gonna rank him, probably somewhere around 5-6"
"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."
"It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been crazy impactful since coming back and like you said they are made of role players, but they probably have some of the most elite role players. Brandon Clarke, Tyus Jones, DeAnthony Melton, Desmond Bane, Kyle Anderson, Grayson Allen, Dillon Brooks. Have all been doing their thang this season."
"True but the question was about a young CORE. Not who had the best young player. Our 1st round pick this year, Desmond Bane, is on pace to break the rookie 3pt% record. He's at 45.9% right now. Brandon Clarke was the summer league MVP last year, Tillman out of Michigan St was a 2nd round steal this year. Grayson Allen has been a 40+% shooter, Ja Morant was Rookie of the Year, and that's all without Jaren Jackson Jr. The whole CORE"
"PG: Shai, Corey Joseph  SG: RJ, Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SF: Wiggins, Dort, Dillon Brooks  PF: Olynk, Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles  C: TT, Khem Birch  7 of those guys play starter minutes. Even if say TT or Dwight Powell don't make it because they're deep in the playoffs, I have no doubt they can beat a Enes Kanter-less Turkey (likely without Ilyasova and Furkan as well) or Giannis-less Greece and no doubt they can beat China or Czech Republic..  With the Olympic games itself I think that team can legitimately get a medal.."
"but there's still dort, shai, boucher, olynk, khem birch, cory joseph  if memphis gets knocked out in the play-in, there's brooks and brandon clarke as well.  if goldenstate gets knocked out or loses first round wiggins is potentially available too."
Brandon Clarke
"Last year if you would have asked me my 4th favorite PF I would have said Davis Bertans, but not anymore. Now I'd say probably Brandon Clarke"
"Oh, yes.  All that Brandon Clarke hype.  Clarke was the perfect fit next to Ayton.  Cam Johnson was a massive reach.  F- grade for the Suns draft.  Yet Clarke was out of the Grizzlies rotation in the playoffs."
Brandon Clarke c'mon on down.
"Hows Canada Rank?  RJ, Murray, Dort, Shai, NAW, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, Kelly O, Brooks, Boucher, Powell, Brandon Clarke"
What blows my mind is the guy is a bucket. Legit scoring threats are really valuable and hard to come across. He's not getting his 20 a game simply from open 3s and backdoor cuts. He earns majority of his points.   Yet even if I'm the grizzlies who could really use another scoring option I'd be hesitant to look at a package of  Dillon Brooks and Brandon Clarke. That itself probably doesn't even start the conversation for Portland either because you're giving up a borderline Allstar level talent for pennies. Crazy..
"Im a honest homer. But Brandon Clarke makes me tingle all the right ways.   Outside from home, Jaxson Hayes is a lovely man with really long arms and legs and a lot of energy. Hope he gets better and for the Pelicans!"
Hoping Brandon Clarke gets better too.
"Sure thing. I‚Äôll list out some players that have been attainable for either team.   Attainable bigs: Myles Turner, Aaron Gordon, Al Horford, Daniel Theis (WTF Boston?!?), Wendell Carter Jr. and Brandon Clarke.   Attainable Guards: Derrick Rose, Malcolm Brogdon, Caris LeVert, Buddy Hield and even CP3/Lowry if rhey made a good enough offer."
"&gt; This doesn't even make much sense. Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  Yeah, but I think this would be addiction by subtraction, team wasn't working out with them here. In hindsight, knowing that Kyrie would lay and egg in the playoffs, means that nothing would make a difference.  Other than trading Kyrie for Kawhi in the beggining of the year, but that's a different story.  &gt; These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls  Trading away the pick to get rid of Kanter's salary was a bad decision.  The rest I agree, people have shut up about Brandon Clarke now because he's getting DNP-CD, which is nice, TT wasn't a great signing but he was injured coming into the season and had covid, but he showed good stuff in the playoffs."
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
I really don't think CJ has a lot of trade value. I don't see sixers trading for him. Imo CJ is like a guard version of  tobias harris. Maybe they can send CJ + picks to the spurs for demar. Or send CJ to Memphis for Kyle Anderson + Brandon Clarke
"What happened with Brandon Clarke , why isn‚Äôt he  getting minutes ?"
It‚Äôs crazy that Brandon Clarke was one of the best rookies in the league last year and now can‚Äôt even get playoff minutes.  Who broke my boy‚Äôs shot? üòï
Also Brandon Clarke.
Why isn‚Äôt Brandon Clarke getting minutes?
Im confused.  What happened to Brandon Clarke.  Is he just out of the rotation?
Did Brandon Clarke forget how to play or something?
I assumed Brandon Clarke was injured and didn't get why he wasn't playing at all before.
"Memphis if you want to win you must play Brandon Clarke.  Sincerely, A Biased Die Hard Gonzaga Fan"
brandon clarke is playing no defense lmao
Memphis fans: what happened to Brandon Clarke this year? Has he been underwhelming compared to what people expected?  He was so damn good as a rookie
Brandon Clarke slipping every single screen is one thing i forgot I hated so much
Brandon Clarke sighting
Oh shit Brandon Clarke sighting
Eh I would argue Darius Bazley would have been more impactful for the Grizzlies rn than Brandon Clarke since Clarke is out of the rotation currently.
Used that pick to move up to get Brandon Clarke tho
Valanciunas had a few really obvious ones last night. If Brandon Clarke ever plays again watch him screen. 90% of the time he slips the screen before even actually setting it up and if he does do an actual screen it's illegal most of the time.
"And Wiggins, RJ Barrett, NAW (Shai‚Äôs actual cousin), Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, and Dwight Powell. The only guys not going to training camp so far are Murray &amp; Shai. Murray must be faking too lol. According to you, Shai rests the entire back half of the season healthy, and is still skipping out on all the marketing and endorsements that would come from being THE guy for team Canada, in order to be ready for the tanking Thunder‚Äôs start of the season. How much rest does he need lol?"
Why hasn‚Äôt Brandon Clarke been playing more instead of JJJ? Dude is clearly not back to his old self
What's up with Brandon Clarke?
My mom would have a Brandon Clarke flair smh
"That‚Äôs funny. You listed the Grizzlies twice.  Since 2014 they have drafted from picks 14 and on;  Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane which is a better haul than Rozier, Williams, and Pritchard.   Not to mention they did it with way less picks."
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
Claxton? Brandon clarke? Idk I‚Äôm reaching
"So what's wrong with Brandon Clarke? Seems solid last season and this regular season, but not getting minutes anymore in play-in and playoffs."
"Grizzlies drafted so well that they benched Brandon Clarke who many considered a steal in the 2019 draft, that‚Äôs crazy"
"Kinda random, but what's up with Brandon Clarke? Healthy DNP? Is he not as big a part of the team as I thought?"
Brandon Clarke and Bane fell because of the same reason the only difference was everybody‚Äôs as laughing at every team for being dumb as shit because those guys are hoopers
"Griz fans, can you explain to me why Brandon Clarke fell out of the rotation?"
Just like Brandon Clarke in his draft
What's up with Brandon Clarke?
"Yeah the reason most small ball lineups in the NBA dont work defensively despite the idea of them sounding good on paper is that stating the obvious but size really matters inside even if it's not always super noticeable with how you structure your defense. Warriors just had nothing to stress the Grizzlies in the paint with X at the 5. Kind of what made Draymond unique the past decade being 6'5 and still being able to be the kind of rim protecting and general paint presence for it to work defensively. Also where vertical spacing helps, Kevin Durant in the death lineups was 6'11, Draymond when he was a 4 had a big to lob it to back in the day. Not that Steve Kerr runs many Steph/Draymond pick and rolls but even when he does just not the same when Draymond is that limited on the short roll as a finisher and there's so little inside to help space it.   Yeah the JJJ thing took balls, I had been calling for it but I didnt think Jenkins would do it to the degree he did. Brandon Clarke was the 2nd best rookie in the NBA last year where was he last night? On the bench, 0 min because he hasnt been good enough to crack the rotation lately. Same idea many wouldnt do that."
Time will tell but right now it's looking like Brandon Clarke
*Brandon Clarke has left the chat*
Brandon Clarke also has wet floater
Pretty wild JJJ or Brandon Clarke aren't in the lineup rn
"im glad we went with luka over brandon clarke lol, so many fans were mad we didnt go for him all those years ago"
Who knew Xavier Tillman would be playing over Brandon Clarke already in his rookie season?
Brandon Clarke not given minutes in crucial games anymore. I guess he might be gone soon?
Why is Brandon Clarke not in the grizzles rotation anymore?
"I'd like to add that Kyle Anderson, Tyus, and Brandon Clarke love floaters/push shots as much as Ja/JV. Like the other commentator said they lead the league in floaters by far.  However them not getting all the way to the rim means the offense really dries up when those tough looks don't go down."
I‚Äôd take Keldon &amp; or Dort over Tyler Herro.  Also Brandon Clarke has a case over Thybulle.
"I have faith that our FO will find a gem in the draft. We got Bane and Tillman for 4 2nd round picks total, 2 for each player. We also got Brandon Clarke in the same draft year we got Ja as well."
"Dillon Brooks reminds me of Miles Bridges. Think it's crazy both guys were PF's in college and now are just 2 of the craziest 2 way, athletic SG/SFs in the league.   Btw, (Celtics fan here) can we get Jonas Valanciunas and SloMo? I've wanted him for a while, but after tonight's game, I'd settle for JJJ or Brandon Clarke."
Why didn‚Äôt Brandon Clarke play?
"Brandon Clarke didn't play this game, what happened to him?"
Is Brandon Clarke hurt or something?
Someone tell me wtf happened to brandon Clarke
Brandon Clarke went from being a net positive as a rookie to DNP-CD
What happened with Brandon Clarke this season? His numbers were great last year on limited minutes but I feel like I haven't heard about him this year
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
The Grizzlies absolutely did. That was probably the worst game-planning I have ever seen in a regular season matchup.  They really had JV trying to contain Curry in ball screens. Half the time he didn‚Äôt even get up at all and he was practically playing drop coverage. Against Curry of all people.   JJJ and Brandon Clarke should‚Äôve played most the minutes. Idk what they were thinking leaving JV out that long.
What happened to Brandon Clarke? He looked so good at times in his career and only played 14 minutes today. Has he fallen way back in the rotation?
"Jonas Valanciunas, Jaren Jackson Jr., Brandon Clarke, Xavier Tillman"
"I made a video two weeks ago about 4 sophmores I was rooting for. Namely, Juan Toscano-Anderson, Brandon Clarke, Tyler Herro, and Naz Reid. My vides  have been getting removed from the team subs for lack of karma but I thought some people in here might enjoy it. Please let me know if you have any comments or criticism.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gPh9UEiFXs"
Dude's definitely old but the amount of shit that older rookies get is ridiculous.  Memphis' entire drafting strategy in the late first round has been taking older guys that are ready to contribute and then people get surprised when players like Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke are making All-Rookie teams.  Hell if I'm picking late in the first round I may as well just go for a high-floor guy since you're getting into a crapshoot that late in the draft.
Dude's definitely old but the amount of shit that older rookies get is ridiculous.

Duarte's older than Bane obviously but he'll slide into whatever team he gets drafted on immediately.
"The SuperSonics move to Oklahoma City.  I become disenfranchised with the NBA.  Few years later I start playing 2K.  I dunno man, something about Clint Capela.  I feel that instant connection.  The only other big man I can remotely relate to is John the Baptist.  (Brandon Clarke wasn‚Äôt in the league yet but I love his game too.).  John gets Trae to partner with.  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Harden (he‚Äôs got OKC stink on him) so I settle with my backup fav and start adopting the Hawks as my main team.  Start following the team, watching the occasional game.  Rebuilding is tough.  Clint gets traded to the Hawks.  I swear my undying fealty to this team of gods on the spot.  Some things just happen that way.  EDIT:  I point out to my dad that he can say ‚ÄúGo Hawks‚Äù.  He joins the bandwagon as well.  It helps, actually."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker‚Ä¶. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
"No patriotism like Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke Have for Canada."
"Kind of patriotism Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke have for Canada."
"The irony is I was SO MAD when we did that, because I wanted Culver. And then I at least wanted Brandon Clarke (who is solid in his own right). Culver could develop into something though."
"&gt; But chemistry is for sure the biggest element. People underestimate how far above their level some international teams play just solely due to how familiar the players are with each other. Understanding the tendencies of your teammates as well as just having that deeper trust makes everyone play better.  I know a while back USA Hockey recognized this and put together a US National Development Team Program that trains and plays together to build chemistry. Not everyone wants to take part in it but a number of the top players from USA do. It's paid off quite well at the World Juniors level as the Americans have won 4 gold medals there since 2010 whereas previously they never won anything. I wonder if Canada can consider doing something like that with high school players. It seems like a lot of them jump to the US for their high school ball (RJ Barrett went to Montverde, Wiggins went to Huntington, Trey Lyles moved to Indianapolis, Brandon Clarke played in Arizona.. although in his case he might have grown up in the States to begin with) so they have no familiarity with each other."
Sga injured. Same Jamal who was planning.   Dillon idk why. I think if he wants Brandon Clarke can play too.
"Ah, I get Olynyk reasoning.  Very unfortunate, since we got nothing offensively from Trey Lyles and Powell.   Forgot about Brandon Clarke as well. He's definitely better on offense than those two."
"A couple of guys they missed out on:  Matisse Thybulle  Brandon Clarke  Darius Bazley  Terrance Mann  Talen Horton-Tucker  Obviously everything is in hindsight, but it's a bit interesting going back and seeing what players teams missed out on later in the draft."
"Easier said when you are  far away from the United States, and the influences of agents and the nba, all the time- not just in season. It‚Äôs sad Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Kabengele, and Brandon Clarke dont care enough to bother to play for Canada."
Brandon Clarke too
Brandon Clarke is definitely a pure PF in the traditional term.
Brandon Clarke
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
"Brandon Clarke is Canadian too right? He could be a player for this squad as well I'd think.  Pretty decent group in all, but little disappointing. An SGA-Murray backcourt with Barrett, Dort and Brooks as your main wings is a really strong medal contender"
"Weird to see Brandon Clarke and Dillon Brooks off the final team, while Bennet and some euro players made the cut"
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
I'd take Ben Simmons over Brandon Clarke
Brandon Clarke deserves a spot over Giannis tbh
"There was a game earlier this season where Brandon Clarke had 3-4 blocks, but was only credited with one."
"&gt;Maxey isn‚Äôt as good of a prospect as Brandon Clarke still  Utah traded a heavily protected 1st, not Clarke. You can't keep equating Maxey to Clarke, when were talking about what Conleys value was to the Jazz.   Maxey &gt;&gt; heavily protected 1st   Korver didn't have value, he was a 38 year old salary dump throw in"
"He wasn‚Äôt in the G-League, he played in the playoffs for Utah. Also that was his rookie year, so most people anticipated him improving. I‚Äôm not saying if he is worth more than Thybulle but your undervaluing what Allen‚Äôs trade value was.   Maxey isn‚Äôt as good of a prospect as Brandon Clarke still  Green also got traded from a championship team for a reason. He wasn‚Äôt better than Crowder was in the last finals. He was champion because he played beside Duncan, Kawhi, and Lebron.    And that is how trade value works since they traded Bazley and Korver before they ever played a game and got assets back for them. So saying Korver had no value is 100% factually incorrect since he was traded for a prospect.  Either way good chat, have fun overhyping your players trade value!"
"&gt;Allen just averaged 23.1 MPG in the playoffs  And he was in the G-League when that trade happened, he had far less value than Thybulle has now   &gt;At the time of the trade Bazley was the 23rd overall pick  And Maxey was the 21st, and clearly has a higher ceiling  &gt;Green is not better than Crowder.  Green is a 3 time champion for a reason. He's been better than Crowder his entire career.  &gt;So in total, trading away Conley got the Grizzlies; Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Winslow, Melton  That's not how trades work. In total, what the Jazz valued Conley at, was Crowder, a G-Leager, a 38 year old and a heavily protected 1st."
"Allen just averaged 23.1 MPG in the playoffs. Great player. Not to mention that Thybulle despite being a great defensive player is one of the worst offensive players in the entire NBA.   At the time of the trade Bazley was the 23rd overall pick. Bazley was then traded with a 2nd round pick for Brandon Clarke. So your assessment of Bazley‚Äôs value is off  Green is not better than Crowder. They are pretty similar and Crowder is probably viewed as the better of the two right now.  Krover had value, he was flipped to the Bucks for assets. Getting Krover allowed the Grizzlies to get Melton.   And the pick was heavily protected, however you don‚Äôt know what the pick situation with Toronto was either.   So in total, trading away Conley got the Grizzlies; Grayson Allen, Brandon Clarke, Winslow, Melton.   I didn‚Äôt see any offers from the 76ers as good as that:"

"Dejounte Murray, Brandon Clarke"
Seriously the amount of takes I see about 2021 draft add already ridiculous  like calm down lol. If summer league was a true telling of how good a player was Brandon Clarke would be an all star by now
In what alternate universe are Diallo and Bazley good picks?  We traded down to get Bazley. The Grizzlies grabbed Brandon Clarke with that pick. That was a good pick.  I guess Diallo will be a good player if the NBA decides to ditch  overtime and replace it with a dunk contest.
"I'll answer as a fan of the Thunder.  1. I'm guessing they tried to trade up and were unsuccessful. Who knows what offer they gave Cleveland that they refused. #6 and 3, 5, 7 FRP's?, we will never know. This draft had a very potent (hype-wise) top 4, and they proved unable to breach it. 2. Presti didn't have Sengun high on his board apparently. Rumor is he would've taken Tre Mann at 16, so the move was easy to make on his end. Also, Presti swings for the fences in the teens, and it hasn't worked out in the past. He could have taken Brandon Clarke over Bazely, Quickley over Poku, Oubre over Cam Payne, OG over Terrance Ferguson, etc. Each of those players are good roleplayers. 3. Sengun has looked great in two Summer League games. Summer. League. In 4 months he will be regularly targeted in PnR and switches. Then this sub can start making judgements. I liked him at 16, but I don't run the largest scouting team in the NBA. 4. His philosophy for a rebuild is literally here: [https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward](https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5637065/sam-presti-looking-back-thinking-forward) . The goal is a championship, not the playoffs, and the NBA is the hardest league in the world to do this in. Championships are won by a top 7 player either paired with another top 20 player or surrounded with top 50 players and high level role players. GSW surrounded Steph with one of the greatest shooters of all time (Klay), one of the highest IQ players of all time (Draymond), Iggy, Livingston, and eventually KD (broke the NBA, not applicable in reality). 5. This was the first draft of the Thunder rebuild with a goal of a championship, not the playoffs. His goal is multiple star players, so he is looking at 2+ years of drafting. If Giddey is that player, great. If he's not, try again. If Shai is unhappy eventually, he will get traded, probably to a destination in his top 3 landing spots. Then they will swing again for another star player through draft or trade. That's how it will go. 6. The draft picks are for trades. Sure, trade ups happen, but the easiest way to get an All-Star caliber player in the modern NBA is trading for an unhappy one. The price is 5-7 first round picks/swaps and good young players. That may be Shai, Giddey, or another pick that looks promising. One star is available every year or two and the Thunder will be interested in most of them I'm guessing. Whether the player wants to play here will be a question as well, I understand, but a lot of young players grew up loving the Westbrook/Durant or Westbrook/PG Thunder, so they won't get discounted as easily as Sacramento or other franchises like that. 7. Houston's young players look great. Let's say Green, Christopher, and Sengun pan out and the equivalent of Dame, CJ, and Nurkic (this is a ceiling outcome for Green and Christopher, and a moderate+ outcome for Sengun). Where does that get you? If your cap is clear and you have assets, you could build a nice team around them and if they stay healthy you have a shot at a conference finals. But this is a big bridge to cross and I would recommend pumping the brakes on an assumption like this after 2 Summer League games. 8. Saying a rebuild is done in one season...I think that's only true if you hit on a top 7 player. Even if it's done, it is hard to build around talented players like that. See Dallas, New Orleans and Cleveland before Lebron left the first time.  9. In conclusion, time will tell. The NBA is a luck game and I'll trust the guy that didn't get us a championship but brought a lot of success last decade for us. I will question his picks and decisions, but I'm just a guy reading subreddits and watching scout videos on YouTube."
"James Wiseman other than warriors players, Killian Hayes. Besides those guys maybe Brandon Clarke"
"Memphis has really nailed the last few drafts.  Ja was an easy pick, but JJJ has shown awesome flashes when healthy, Brandon Clarke had a great rookie year (not sure what happened this last year), Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen,  and now Bane.   JJJ just needs to pop alongside Ja!"
"Basically no NBA players were born in Vancouver, so extending the standard to anyone who grew up in Vancouver or British Columbia in general, we have:  PG Steve Nash SG Bob Houbregs SF Brandon Clarke PF Kelly Olynyk C Robert Sacre  What an incredible squad."
"RJ, Dillon Brooks, Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, NAW, Khem Birch, Olynyk, etc. They won't challenge the US, but are definitely a medal contender if everyone plays"
I would do Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Clarke probably.
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
"I didn't get to watch, is this guy pretty much a Brandon clarke clone?"
Yes. I think Brandon Clarke is available and I also think he would a good fit and a cheap option!
"Yeah because Rui, Sabonis &amp; Brandon Clarke are all really suffering in the league."
They should trade both of them to the Grizzlies for Grayson Allen and Brandon Clarke
"**PG:** Ja Morant, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Desmond Bane, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Ziaire Williams.  **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, Santi Aldama.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   That's excluding Bledsoe."
"Dealing or using second round picks got Memphis some steals with Brandon Clarke, Desmond Bane, and Xavier Tillman."
I‚Äôm not enough of a college/draft guy to really comment on Duarte but considering he‚Äôs close to the oldest player in the draft I‚Äôd expect a number of teams to have a good look at him. A team like Memphis has benefitted in recent years from drafting older guys like Desmond Bane and Brandon Clarke. Also he shot the three well so naturally there will be some interest.  It will be fascinating nonetheless to see how Pelinka navigates it.
Free Brandon Clarke!!
I‚Äôd trade 7 for 10 and Brandon Clarke tbh. Take Moody or Giddey at 10 and Mitchell or Duarte at 14.
players like Brandon clarke older already know what works for them &amp; can play a role soon as possible
"I'd say for Quickley you need to give him another year. Don't forget, that Knicks fans found him a breath of fresh air compared to Elfrid Payton too. But remember the hype around Brandon Clarke? Very disappointing second year."
I think Brandon Clarke is totally expendable if the front office wants to keep moving up.
"Dude our drafts under Zach Kleiman have been insane. Like getting Ja is pretty easy, second pick take best player available. But he also found Brandon Clarke who was the steal of that draft, and last year found Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman at 30 and 35.   The only players who shot better from deep as rookies than Bane in the last ten years were Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum. I think in a few seasons people are going to be scratching their heads why Bane went so late.  Tillman was also a good find, I think he's a solid backup big who will stick around in the league a long time.  Grizz fans aren't overlooking that we didn't just trade up the first round pick. 10 and 40 instead of 17 and 51, Kleiman just might find two more solid pieces."
It‚Äôd be tough to pull off.  Id be fine sending Thompson for him but he doesn‚Äôt make enough money.  Smart would probably have to be in the deal but that‚Äôs obviously too much to give up for Bledsoe.  Realistically it would have to be something like Smart and Thompson for Bledsoe and Desmond Bane and/or Brandon Clarke.
Warriors have the 7th. Grizzlies have a Warriors future 1st and Grayson Allen and Brandon Clarke to sweeten the deal.
Grizz have the Warriors 2023 1st. Perhaps they try to move up to 7.  Maybe toss in Brandon Clarke to sweeten the deal.
Desmond Bane will be the new Brandon Clarke Ill spend the offseason hyping him up and he'll be out of the rotation by the end of next yr lol
"Moving JJJ to centre, maybe?  **PG:** Ja Morant, Eric Bledsoe, De'Anthony Melton, Tyus Jones.   **SG:** Dillon Brooks, Grayson Allen.   **SF:** Kyle Anderson, Desmond Bane.   **PF:** Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke.   **C:** Steven Adams, Xavier Tillman.   Looking at that:  1. I'm not sure they're finished, and maybe they're going to package some young players, picks and a contract to get one more starter?  2. If they keep the 10th pick and intend to move JJJ to centre, maybe they take Jalen Johnson and try to make him their PF?"
"There's a big difference between 10 and 17, even in this year's draft. If someone falls a bit, getting him at 10 is better than hoping for a Brandon Clarke scenario"
"Yes J3 and JV are good players, as was Brandon Clarke last season, and I hope he turns it around this season, but the point being made is that, as it‚Äôd be true of Christian wood and Michael? porter jr(I hope I didn‚Äôt get my porter jrs mixed up again).   All that to say tha to thd guy‚Äôs point, yes a rookie guard can successfully take the reins of a team in the nba."
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Not necessarily as good, but Memphis definitely have a promising young core:   Ja Morant (21)  Desmond Bane (23)  Jaren Jackson Jr (21)  Brandon Clarke (24)  Xavier Tillman (22)"
"One move I think would be fascinating is calling Atlanta about Bogi and see if you can do a Brandon Clarke plus SlowMo for Bogi. I think if you push Dillion Brooks to the 3, and have a starting five of Ja, Bogi, Brooks, JJJ, and Valancuinas you may be a playoff team. Atlanta would get to replace a cost controlled version of Collins and work a S&amp;T to get some assets back."
Much higher if Cam Johnson is starting over Brandon Clarke. Clarke is probably 3rd string behind PJ
"Does it have to be a player? Because the biggest variable I think has to be Coach Jenkins. Got a lot of talent this year, and last year a couple guys were put in the doghouse that seemingly had a ton of potential as heavy rotation guys before then, particularly DeAnthony Melton and Tyus Jones. Brandon Clarke sucked last year and needs to turn it around. If it has to be a player, the obvious answer is JJJ, but I feel Jenkins' decisions and rotations will be as important."
Him and Brandon Clarke both on my watch list. Adams will mentor JJJ well
Marc Gasol   Mike Conley   Rudy Gay   Ja Morant   JJJ  Dillon Brooks   Desmond Bane   Kyle Anderson   Deanthony Melton   Brandon Clarke   Xavier Tillman   Ziaire Williams
"We like our bigs shooting about one three a game, yeah.  For the 2020-21 season:  Jonas Valanciunas: 0.9 three attempts a game at 36.8%  Xavier Tillman: 1.1 threes at 33.8%  Brandon Clarke: 1.3 threes at 26% (something happened to his shooting form, he was fine at 36% his rookie year on 1.1 attempts)  Then Jaren has the ultra green light."
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
"I‚Äôm not reading all that, it‚Äôs about ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke."
The race baiting isn't a very good look dude. You're taking a song about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke and trying to spin it into a debate about race just to satisfy your internet sjw keyboard warrior prerogative.
Pretty unbelievable the amount of hate you have for Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke. You racist or something?
Bro looking back I never would have guessed ty Jerome would get more minutes than the god Brandon Clarke himself that‚Äôs good detail from Kanye
No it was talking about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
Yep Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
No it was about Ty Jerome and Brandon Clarke
Did Brandon Clarke disappear?
Brandon Clarke is a better prospect than Smith. Not doing that just for cost control
"That‚Äôs just not true. It‚Äôs understandable to be excited about Tyrese having that kind of efficiency and volume as a rookie because it‚Äôs uncommon and impressive, but it‚Äôs not nearly as rare as you‚Äôre suggesting it is.  Since 2017, there‚Äôs been   * Zion: 22.5 ppg on 61.6% ts (small sample size but little reason to suspect it was unsustainable) * Brandon Clarke: 12.1 ppg on 66.3% ts * Ayton: 16.3 ppg on 60.8% ts * JJJ: 13.8 on 59.1% ts. * Tatum: 13.9 ppg on 58.6% ts  * Embiid: 20.2 ppg on 58.4% ts   That‚Äôs 6 other guys in just the past 5 years let alone 2 decades. All were more efficient than Tyrese (Tatum only slightly) except for Embiid who averaged over 7 more ppg on only .1% lower ts. And all of them averaged a higher ppg except for Clarke who averaged .9 fewer ppg on an almost 8% higher ts."
"Comparing players outside of Ja and JJJ vs Kat, DLo, and Ant.. this is what we have  Memphis: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Tyus Jones, Desmond Bane, Xavier Tilman, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton.  Minnesota: Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley, Tauren Prince, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, Josh Okogie  While I 100% agree that Memphis has more playable guys, we really only have a couple starting-good bench quality players on each. Memphis definitely has more lower bench guys that are still playable, but I focus more on the few that are starter quality players, like: Dillon Brooks, Steven Adams, Kyle Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Malik Beasley.  I think Brandon Clarke and Naz Reid are both close to that level, and everyone else is just decent in a bench role or shouldn't be getting minutes, on both teams..  So the big factor is 3 all star potential players versus 2, though I argue JJJ is by far the biggest stretch to hit that point this season. Also KAT is the best of those 5, then Ja really isn't ahead of DLo and Ant by that much when everyone is healthy. Imo"
"Technically no one from the suburb I live in, but best player born in Metro Vancouver is Brandon Clarke, but the best player to play high school here was Rob Sacre. Not a lot of players come out of Vancouver..."
"Per IG, Simmons, Rondo, Jordan Clarkson, Justise Winslow, JJJ, Jarred Vanderbilt, Aaron Gordon, Jordan Bell, Brandon Clarke, BJ Boston were at the most recent run, and Michael Beasley, Lonnie Walker, Ja, Maxey, and Bazely have gone to other ones."
"Nah, they're playing vs other pros. Jalen Johnson, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Rondo, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles, JJJ, Jordan Bell, and Brandon Clarke were at the last run with BJ and Simmons."
"I hope whoever told Brandon Clarke he has to fix his funky looking jumper isn‚Äôt still working with him. Sure his shot look weird, but at least it went in at a pretty good rate. Dude is fun to watch when he‚Äôs on it. The whole Memphis team is like that, really."
"DB is great. Your classic ""NO NO NO YES!!!"" player. He can be a real black hole with questionable shot selection, but when he's playing well just get out of the way. Gives his all on D too, Doris couldn't stop gushing about him late in the season. DB hearts DB.  And of course I got love for all the Canadians. Brandon Clarke is ten tons of fun too."
"there a few obvious ones but id say the grizzlies  u have a great leader and pg in morants along with a rlly solid big man secondary in jaren jackson  i think brandon clarke is also quite underrated, and add the beast thats is a 28 year old steven adams and thats a rlly solid young core"
I dunno how you can say Hawks and Grizz in the same sentence because Hawks kinda have better players than the Grizzlies at all positions  Trae &gt; Ja  Collins and JJJ is a wash  Hunter &gt; Brooks  Then the Hawks have Huerter and Reddish too while the Grizzlies have‚Ä¶ Brandon Clarke?
Brandon Clarke is 25. Many saw him as a potential star after his rookie season? What happened?
Brandon Clarke is rough.
"I like Brandon Clarke but doubt Memphis is willing to part with him for what we would offer, Xavier Tillman is probably more realistic as he‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even in Memphis rotation right now. He‚Äôs a solid athletic rim runner that can hit a 3 that has good energy and can play the 4 and 5. He‚Äôs the most obvious answer I can think of, TBJ and a second would solve a lot of our size problems."
"He's a talented defender but he's a 20mpg player and he's 24 years old. Its a fine pick.   Look at the picks after...   Brandon Clarke 24mpg   Grant Williams 18mpg   Darius Bazley 31 mpg   Then a bit lower...   Jordan Poole 20 mpg    Keldon Johnson 29 mpg   Kevin Porter Jr 32 mpg   Nic Claxton 17 mpg   Its a fine pick. Definitely not bad, but not the best value pick in that draft range."
"i‚Äôve met a ton of grizzlies players over the years. memphis is basically a big small town, so it‚Äôs not that difficult to run into the guys around. brandon clarke was my most recent meet, and he was a really chill, unassuming, nice guy."
"JJJ, Brandon Clarke, DeAnthony Melton, Culver. And that's just on the Grizz."
I know Kelly Olynyk and Brandon Clarke both had huge growth spurts either right at or directly after turning 18. They both needed a redshirt year at Gonzaga to figure out how to play in their new bodies
Brandon Clarke might have the ugliest jumper I have ever seen. What did he do to his shot??
"Jaren missed almost all of last season. If he plays well, they could be about as good or even better than last season. Ja Morant, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, Jaren Jackson, Desmond Bane, Steven Adams, and Brandon Clarke is a decent core. Definitely not great and they could miss the playoffs pretty easily especially with the warriors presumably being better but they're a decent team."
Kyrie Irving and Buddy Hield were both born in 1992. Hield is also older than AD and Beal   Also Brandon Clarke is older than Jaylen Brown
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
"Brown since Tatum's already bordering superstardom  Malik Monk  Tyrese Maxey  Brandon Clarke  Kevin Huerter  Miles Bridges  Bol Bol  Killian Hayes since he had an awful first year, and there's nowhere to go but up  Kevin Porter Jr., he turned a corner since arriving in Houston and is still super young compared to Wood  Tyler Herro since Duncan Robinson already looks polished and at his peak  RJ Barrett since Randle is already an All-NBA player  Terrance Mann since Winslow's injuries have hampered him too much  Nickeil Alexander-Walker  Patrick Williams  Anthony Edwards, a 20 year-old who came off of near ROY can really only get better."
Yea yea so did Brandon Clarke
"The only player I know publicly isn't fully vaxxed is Melton who has had 1 shot and just needs his second. [(Source Here)](https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1442556923518148611?s=20)  But we know for sure [Ja](https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1442544340631494662?s=20), [JJJ](https://twitter.com/jarenjacksonjr/status/1375248575014137856?s=20), [Adams](https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1442540192691273728?s=20), [SloMo](https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1442528973079162880?s=20), [Bane](https://twitter.com/ChrisHerrington/status/1442544340631494662?s=20), and [Clarke](https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2021/03/31/memphis-grizzlies-grayson-allen-brandon-clarke-out-utah-jazz-nba/4829391001/) are all fully vaxxed."
"Brandon Clarke had that shit mastered in his rookie year, my man would take a step past the 3 point line and then float that shit in. Idk what happened to his shot tho"
"I‚Äôm optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
"Brandon Clarke resurgence, plus Jackson, Adams, and Anderson getting minutes in the front court."

Utah Jazz bench letting Brandon Clarke know!
"Sure ended up well for them. At the time Saric hadnt shown a whole lot sonce being drafted by the 6ers. And Cam Johnson was an end of the 1st guy, Suns got clowned on for drafting him so high. Obvioisly worked out very well for them. It was not a super deep draft. If the Wolves stayed at 11 they most likely wouldve gone with like a Brandon Clarke."
People putting this entirely on JV are being very lazy or just ignorant. Jv wasn't a good defender and the defense has suffered a huge regression even in minutes were jv would not have been on the floor.  As you say Anderson and Tillman were our best defenders besides brooks last year and they both have reduced minutes with JJJ return and Brandon Clarke taking their minutes.  I think Brooks' impact goes beyond his 1v1 defense. He seems to have quarterbacked the defense and was vocal in its coordination. I've noticed with his return that defensive intensity of the team is picking up somewhat and I think we'll see the grizzlies Dtg improve if he stays healthy.   .
"Brooks, Brandon Clarke and Jaren all look really nice together. Particularly Brandon and Jaren.  Ja, Bane and Steven Adams are a great combo.  Slightly awkward that they don't all mesh."
"Thanks, the NBA is so foreign to me with second round draft picks being basically worthless. I have been disappointed they couldn't get the late lottery Gonzaga players I knew would have an impact Sabonis, Brandon Clarke Bf Rui Hachimura. As someone who follows college more I've been kind of confused with the draft picks we've made over the last like 10 years"
Who can tell me what happened to Brandon Clarke?? Dude was pretty good his rookie season
Good point. It seems like Memphis may have too much young depth. Do they even play Brandon Clarke? At some point it might be smart to trade some of those guys for big time starter to go with Morant and Jackson.
"if that trade package got traded for Thaddeus Young or Brandon Clarke the Bulls wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye, let alone friggin Myles Turner LMAO"
"I want props to Brandon mfing Clarke...after Trips fouled out, I thought we were in trouble. This guy came up clutch in OT.  Side note: these games have been too damn fun, props also to the Wolves for coming on our floor and having their three stars put up big games.  Also FOUL HIM BEFORE HE SHOOTS THE THREE..."
"Ja Morant.  Additionally, Brandon Clarke."
"KAT and Ja gonna get all the spotlight this game, but the real star was Brandon Clarke"
Brandon Clarke had himself a game! He was huge in OT after Jaren fouled out with multiple boards and buckets
Great game for Brandon Clarke   That was a rollercoaster of emotions
wtf Brandon Clarke with 20 points
BRANDON CLARKE üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üá®üá¶
"Why is Brandon Clarke not getting any playing time ? Haven‚Äôt watched any games , just looking at stats . Can somebody tell me ?"
"If you look at our first 8 games it's actually literally the toughest stretch of the entire season for us. So to be looking at emerging from that as .500 or better is awesome, especially considering we're missing an impactful starter who should be back soon.  Desmond Bane and Deanthony Melton are both the real deal, and watching them develop in front of our eyes is awesome. Bane is in contention for one of the smoothest jumpers in the league right now.  Ja is an all-star this year, no cap.  Jaren hasn't had the breakout some expected, and Ziaire is just as raw as predicted, although I feel he's been growing steadily.  Grizzly Adams is a great fit. Xavier Tillman should get more minutes than Brandon Clarke. Slow Mo is a professional competitor, whose shot has regressed because the hitch is back. Tyus is the definition of solid, over 20 assists and 1 TO so far.  That's pretty much it"
"Not gonna lie u might have something here especially when brooks comes back.  Bane (if he comes off the bench), slo-mo, tyus Jones, Brandon clarke are nice.  I think they need a yr and then they'll be one of the best benches"
Can someone please explain to me why Brandon Clarke is no longer in the rotation for the Grizz?
