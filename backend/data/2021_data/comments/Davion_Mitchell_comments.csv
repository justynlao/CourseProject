"Are you serious? Those guys are teammates. Here’s another random collection of college players I would coalesce into one team: Davion Mitchell, Jared Butler, MaCio Teague, Mark Vital, Flo Thamba. Jeez, imagine those 5 together! They might even be able to beat this guy’s group!"
"Cooper shot 82.5% on a huge volume of FTs.  I think there are concerns with his shot, but it is entirely possible he is a decent shooter who would have been fine if he got to play longer than 12 games and stayed multiple years in school to pick up a larger sample size.  LaMelo, DeAaron Fox examples of players with unsustainably bad three point percentages before NBA that became fine in the NBA.  He projects to be a better shooter than Davion Mitchell, yet Mitchell is getting big time hype on this thread.  Mitchell made five threes total his first 12 games at Auburn, made less than 2/3 of his FTs in college."
Davion Mitchell is good
"if this dude becomes an all star theres going to be major confusion between the mitchells,  sidenote hopefully knicks get him so we can have Davion Mitchell Robinson"
It's very top heavy and super super thin at the Center position. Last year's draft class probably had better depth of talent. Though i do think some very good guard prospects are being severely underrated (Jared Butler/Miles McBride/Davion Mitchell)
Davion Mitchell has dragon blood in him. Not related to Donovan at all.
"* Helped: Johnny Juzang, Jared Butler, Davion Mitchell, Ethan Thompson, Max Abmas, Kevin Obanor,   * Hurt: Corey Kispert, Ayo Dosunmu, Duane Washington, basically the entire Texas team"
Davion Mitchell could honestly go lottery
Johnny Juzang went from a 2nd rounder to probably late 1st rounder with March Madness. Davion Mitchell went from late 1st rounder to mid 1st rounder.   Someone who didn’t play like BJ Boston is hurt even more. There was already questions about his game and to see him struggle so badly in a weak SEC that did nothing this tournament makes it even worse.
Davion Mitchell maybe?
"Not all lottery teams are rebuilding teams. If you were a team like the Pelicans and you believed Zion/Ingram can be your two future superstars, you would be way better off taking Davion Mitchell than some guy like Ziaire Williams or BJ Boston who easily can be the next Thon Maker."
"So we got Jarded Butler and Jimmy Butler, Flo Thamba and Mo Bamba, and Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell.  The simulation getting a bit repetitive and uncreative ngl, what's next ""Bronny James""?"
Davion Mitchell over juzang bro?! He’s a McDonald’s all American he just was at Kentucky this is a lottery pick.
Idk about Knicks getting Davion Mitchell.  He definitely seems like such a Thibs guy but idk if he adds anything this team is missing.  I'm not sure to trust his jumper just yet.  Maybe trade down a bit and go for someone like Ayo.  Maybe shift around to see about Juzang but that may be recency bias speaking.  I just don't really trust BJ Boston at all as a prospect.

It's Davion Mitchell time.
"Best passer in the draft and toughest player in the draft to stay in front of.  One of the few guys in the draft with some primary creator ability.  Definitely a big concern whether he can have value without being the primary creator on his team, though.  I think he'll probably struggle to score efficiently from the field, but maybe his jumper is a bit of a LaMelo situation - has sloppy mechanics and fades away a lot, but has fine natural touch and starts to shoot well once he cleans up mechanics.  Three point shooting percentage super variable over small sample sizes.  I see Davion Mitchell getting mocked in the lottery and his shooting splits as a freshman were worse than Cooper's."

"Davion Mitchell getting so overrated after his tournament performance, not even the best guard on his own team lmao"
I really tried this week to incorporate more consensus mock than I have in past weeks - particularly Davion Mitchell going lottery and Keon going over Moody. I still think I may be having Kai Jones go a bit too late. Dosunmu I moved up a bit too based on what a lot of post-MM consensus is coming out with.
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he’s too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he’s probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it’ll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He’s already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"if Steph and Klay are healthy they have a great chance. that's the two greatest shooters the NBA has ever seen. they always have a chance. James Wiseman and Jordan Poole should be much improved as well, not saying they're gonna be all-stars but they should be solid contributors. Andrew Wiggins is much better suited to being a third option, and Kelly Oubre is much better suited to a 6th man role if they decide to resign him. the Dubs 2nd round pick from this year Justinian Jessup is doing really well in the Australian league averaging 15 ppg and shooting 40% from 3 on high volume, he'll be coming over next season and could be a decent bench player.   all that said the Dubs can potentially have two lottery picks to add to the bench as well. if they added a backup wing and backup pg in the lotto like Jonathan Kuminga or Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell they could have a deep bench."
"At best they're getting kuminga, green, or Davion Mitchell because of the protections"
"Meanwhile, the jazz are hoping to draft Davion Mitchell do they can have 2 D.Mitchells on the team."

jazz should draft davion mitchell
He thinks he's Davion Mitchell.
"Sorry I just woke up. Keon Johnson is a guy at the very beginning of the college season were saying was flying high under the radar until mocks started catching up. He's the type where eye test &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his superficial stats. His upside is extremely high. Let me explain the love for Keon:  1) He's arguably the best defensive SG prospect in the draft (maybe only Moody is better) and even though he's 6'5, he has a 6'8 wingspan.  2) Although his shooting splits were bad, he has a very mechanically sound jumper and college shooting is notoriously small sample size for a variable that requires a very high sample size for confidence  3) He has a really strong IQ for off-ball movement, his off-ball cutting is elite.  4) He's amazing at drawing fouls and getting to the line - 40% FT/FA rate. Combined with a tight handle, elite athleticism, and a solid FG% at the rim makes him very projectable as a guy who will be able to get to the rim in the NBA.  5) Both him and Jaden Springer are both SGs - so play finishing wasn't really overly productive at Tennessee due to a lack of playmaking  So you have a guy who is a great defender, can handle well, is great at getting to the basket whether that's through FTs or getting around his man, and the only real flaw is he shot terribly in college which ruined his production numbers, but there's nothing real mechanically wrong or shot that needs to be re-worked. Additionally, pretty much all other alternatives are equally as flawed or moreso - Scottie Barnes doesnt have a jumper, Jalen Johnson terribly underperformed in pretty much all aspects, Davion Mitchell and Bouknight are already older and behind on the NBA development curve, etc."

"He’s too much of a combo guard imo and behind on the age curve, his playmaking isn’t good enough to be a 1, and his jumper isn’t good enough off the dribble/getting to the rim, and he’s not good at getting to the line to be an elite scoring 2.  25% FT/FA, 82% of his 3s assisted, 52% TS, etc.  I’m incredibly weary of any upperclassman who finds a big scoring jump on his last year - his skill set doesn’t feel that scaleable. My personal belief is that he’ll max out as a 6th man which is not something you want as a lottery pick  I feel this way about Davion Mitchell too, but I think he made way too much noise at tournament.  Hope to be proven wrong, I don’t wanna see any kid fail"
"Raptors back to the playoffs, 4 seed, Siakam, VanVleet, and Anunoby all-stars, draft Davion Mitchell in the 2021 draft to replace Kyle and he makes first-team all-rookie, we pick up a center in FA"
"If the Minnesota pick conveys (73% chance), the Dubs have some special draft capital this year. It could be enticing to the Clips to draft a young defensive minded PG like Davion Mitchell, and then a high upside SF like Scottie Barnes or Zhiare Williams.  Obviously Wiggins would have to be included in the trade to match salaries."
"Yes I think trades are likely. However, its not just 2 more young guards, Moody is a 3&amp;D 2/3, so I'm not really sure it's fair to call him a ""guard."" He very much could be in the Oubre role if Oubre leaves. Moses Moody has a 7 foot wingspan.   Second, backup PG I think is a need for your team and I think Davion Mitchell is the most NBA ready one at that pick, especially since he's a very good POA defender, who could sometimes spell Klay and play alongside Steph against smaller lineups. Just my 2c."

"I’m curious to see what we do with our draft picks this year. We could package them for a vet with scoring abilities like jerami grant, maybe a better rim protector like Myles turner.   We could also double up on shooters/playmakers in the draft. Davion Mitchell at 7 and Jalen Johnson/Zaire Williams at 17 would be a sweet first round."

Davion Mitchell is not falling that low. Teams love him
Davion Mitchell is going to be the DROY next year
"Reasoning:   1. Cunningham is the surefire guy of this draft. You could argue other guys have more upside, but nobody has a higher floor. Cade will be an NBA starter, it's just a question of whether he'd be a third option, second option, or first option on a contender.  2. Green is the type of hyperathletic scoring guard that teams crave. He's the most likely in this draft to become the first option on a contender, in my opinion. He fits well with the Rockets rebuild, forming a dynamic duo with KPJ in the backcourt.  3. Mobley is a fascinating prospect who brings great perimeter skills in a big man's body. His post offense is worrying, and his lack of a shot is too, but his perimeter defense and driving ability as a seven footer make him a unicorn, even if those other skills don't develop.  4. Suggs is the purest PG in the draft, a classic ball handler who projects to do everything right, even if he lacks any one exceptional gift. He's a sizable point guard with no holes in his game. A very safe pick with long term upside. This guy might be Toronto's starting point guard for the next fifteen years.  5. Barnes fits that Patrick Williams mold, and if Williams can go 4th off the Seminoles bench, Barnes can do it as their most important player. He's a big, high motor wing who can lock down guards and has shown potential at the other end. Even if he doesn't develop his shot, he'll be a valuable wing for years to come.  6. Kuminga has the body, he has the athleticism, but his basketball IQ is horrible. He showed flashes of ball handling, shot creation, passing, and mid-range shooting, but his only positive talent right now is getting to the rim from a midrange spot. He's the definition of a boom or bust project pick, but his boom is big enough that he's worth betting on by a rebuilding team, similar to Poku last year.  7. Wagner here is probably going to be controversial. In my defense, John Hollinger at The Athletic and Deanondraft both agree with me. He's a big wing who can guard 1-4 and projects to be very above average at it in the NBA, rebounds well, passes surprisingly well (&gt;2:1 AST:TO), slashes well, and shoots FTs at an elite level for a 19yo, let alone a 6'9 forward. He projects to be a Kelly Oubre type with less hops and finishing ability, but more shooting and passing. He'll be a valuable player from day 1 as a teenager at a premium position, and has all the tools to become an exceedingly solid wing, if probably not ever an all star due to his lack of elite quick twitch muscle. As a final point, if you want to bring up his last game (where he wasn't great), I'll remind you he also outplayed Scottie Barnes in their March Madness matchup.  8. Moody is the most likely guy in this draft to become a plus 3&amp;D wing for the next fifteen years. Lots of Warriors fans want him, but I simply don't see him having the upside of Wagner. He slides into the Orlando roster, providing needed spacing and defense.  9. Johnson has a lot of question marks, but when he has it all together, he puts up crazy numbers. He can do it all. His shot may be questionable but he shows promise. He's the second biggest boom or bust prospect after Kuminga, in my opinion, and Sacramento needs to swing for the fences to get out of their current purgatory.  10. Bouknight has been flying up mock drafts, and I think he's a good pick, but a little overrated at this point. He has some major flaws despite his highlight play athleticism. His ball handling, shooting, and defense all need more work than I think most people recognize.  11. Keon is similar to Bouknight: some very promising signs at the shooting guard position, but a whole bunch of question marks as well. Not too much to say here, just a guy drafted for his potential.  12. Sengun has promise - Hollinger would say I have him way too low - and I get it: he's putting up good numbers in a really good league as a teenager, and such guys rarely fail in the NBA. However, he's a tweener, neither a PF nor a C, and he lacks the shooting that would cover for his deficiencies at either position. He could put it together and be a valuable big man, but he might end up getting run off the floor, too.  13. Giddey is another boom or bust guy, a huge point guard who can pass like crazy, but lacks the shooting or defense requisite for the position. He's young as hell, so it all comes down to a team's deep scouting on him. Can they fix his obvious flaws? If he develops right, he could end up being an amazing player. But that seems to be a long way off. A team like the Pacers, in that 8th seed purgatory, needs to take a gamble to get out, similar to the Nuggets with MPJ.  14. Kispert projects to be the best shooter in this draft, and his defense is actually pretty good. Was in the 25th percentile for lateral movement at the combine, FYI - I definitely had some bias against his defensive skills, picturing him as a lumbering (white) player. But he has the size and strength and shooting skill to be an elite floor spacer, and can drive better than you might imagine. There are questions around his shooting stroke being effective against NBA defense, but in all likelihood he'll be a good-if-not-great 3&amp;D player right out of the gate.   No Davion Mitchell, you ask? Yeah. I'm incredibly low on him. His FT% has declined each season in college. His first two collegiate seasons he shot about 30% from deep, then happened to shoot 45% his last year, without a corresponding increase to 2pt% or FT% - that's the definition of an outlier. Yeah he plays good defense, but his 6'0 height limits him on that end. At best he'll be a smaller Marcus Smart, which is wonderful, but very limited. And I don't think he gets to that level."

"This should be common, Davion Mitchell is getting really overrated by draft analysts"
"Happy to hear! If it's between Butler and his teammate Davion Mitchell for #14, I'd rather have Butler. Dude is a bucket. Plus he's 2 years younger. If he falls in the late teens/20's, he's a steal"
"If he’s not a health risk anymore, he should go before Davion Mitchell. He’s was the best prospect on that Baylor team"
"That trade is horrible for the warriors. Wiggins has been amazing for them, Wiseman is a center (position they need the most) who is very young with amazing potential, the 7th overall pick (projected to be Davion Mitchell, who would be an amazing combo guard for them as well) as well as 2 first round picks for a player who wouldn't help the team more than Wiggins."

&gt; Suggs is just a 6'4 Davion Mitchell 🤦  Nobody said that but you.   You aren't drafting a PG who has concerns with ball handling and shooting over Jalen Green or even Mobley.
Yup you right. Suggs is just a 6'4 Davion Mitchell 🤦
"&gt; what's Davion Mitchell?  6ft tall instead of being 6""4"
Condensing his game down to a defensive pg ain't it fam. Why would just a defensive pg be mocked in the top 4? If he's a defensive pg what's Davion Mitchell?
"It's just a list of what they perceive as players' upside, BJ Boston is less bad than Davion Mitchell being ranked above multiple 18/19-year-olds that he isn't even currently that much better than."
"Davion Mitchell is a perimeter defender that can compete from day 1.  His shooting performance this year is what makes him at 7 legit, if you believe in it."
"Doing a mock based on upside and putting 22-year-old Davion Mitchell ahead of multiple 18-year-olds that are already 1st rounders is trolling your brains out. Giddey and Springer have cases for being better prospects in a normal draft, much less one purely dictated by upside."
Then they should pick up a seasoned guy like Davion Mitchell  Or trade the picks
"Dubs probably are grabbing one of those two, or Davion Mitchell."

And then Suggs got destroyed by Davion Mitchell and Baylor. So Davion Mitchell is the pick at 1 right?
"I think it should be Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Dwight Howard and #28pick.. for Andrew Wiggins,  #7 pick, #14 pick, James Wiseman, Kelly Oubre…. Warriors could trot out Steph,Klay, Simmons, Draymond, Dhoward with the Curry bros playing together finally also…. The 76ers can roll out Tyrese Maxey, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Oubre, Tobias Harris, Embiid with a nice bench of Davion Mitchell (the 7 pick), James Wiseman, Corey Kispert (14 pick), Thybulle etc…."

"Gotta be Davion MITCHELL, maybe cam Thomas"
Seriously I know its late but Davion Mitchell is near top of my draft board for Hawks.
That’s a long winded way of saying the Warriors should trade down with the Knicks because you want Davion Mitchell lol  14 for 19 + 21 would be interesting though
They can gladly have 20+48 and two seconds. Getting someone like Davion Mitchell would be huge for us
ITT: People being tricked by Wiggins having the most efficient year of his career playing next to Stephen Wardell Curry and now claiming him and Siakam are now pretty close in value. Wiggins is has been a very bad scorer with zero playmaking for 4.5 years when put into a primary ball handling roll.   If Toronto trades for him there is no Steph Curry to take all the attention away so guess which version of Wiggins we get?  Wiseman had one of the worst rookie seasons statistically in years and the injury he’s currently recovering from prevents him from making any real skill development this off season. So who ever trades for him is getting the same guy just coming off an injury so he might actually look worse.   People are overrating the fuck out of this package. Davion Mitchell and what Kispert at 14? That plus those two other guys isn’t worth any all nba players in their prime. At least not if I was the GM of the other team. You’re literally just hoping and praying Wiseman doesn’t turn out to be a bust because the chance of pick 7 being an allstar is like 5% and like almost no chance for pick 14 and lol at hoping Wiggins will be the saviour of your team
Davion Mitchell is essentially a smaller Jrue Holiday
Davion Mitchell
"His floor is a Jrue Holiday, which is already good. He has potential to be an all-star point-guard. Hell, maybe theres a chance that the Donovan Mitchell comparison actually come true. Anyway, Davion is my favorite player in this draft."
Davion Mitchell not Donovan
Toronto Raptors select  Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell if it’s not traded

I think Giddey (and honestly all of the other jumbo playmaker wings like Wagner and Jalen Johnson) will be off the table by then. Giddey is pretty heavily mocked for Indiana.   I’ve seen Davion Mitchell and Moses Moody mocked to you all and they seem pretty solid as high floor prospects who could give you all some Immediate depth. Not high on Moody that much anymore since he’s bit undersized to be a 3&amp;D wing but yeah
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."
Davion Mitchell could be ready for contribute right away due to him being older
I've seen a lot of mocks that have GSW taking Davion Mitchell at #7 and Moses Moody at #14. In the worst-case scenario where they can't get a trade and Oubre walks then it fills out their depth with some high-floor rookies.  PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole  SF: Wiggins / Toscano  PF: Draymond / Moody  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid roster - definitely some concerns about injuries and age but if the dubs Core 3 hits that spark again then there's enough ammo for one last run.
"Trade one of them, maybe with Wiseman and S&amp;T Oubre for some veteran help. If you trade 14, Davion Mitchell or Bouknight would be nice at 7. If you trade 7, I think Moses Moody or Usman Garuba would be perfect at 14. I guess it would depend on who you get in the trade though."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
Josh Giddey will end up being the best player of this draft class. Also Davion Mitchell will get one dpoy and multiple all defensive first teams
"Maybe, but it seems like there are some older guys like Davion Mitchell or Corey Kispert going around 14 that could probably start for us.  Both of them might go higher than that but maybe we'll get lucky who knows."
"Zero depth if they have to give up the pick (probably a rotation player from the outset), Wiseman and Wiggins. They have $170 million committed without resigning Oubre. I'd rather have Wiggins + Wiseman + Davion Mitchell or Scottie Barnes than Siakam and some minimum guys filling out the top 8 rotation."
"Which is why this won't happen.  The warriors still need depth. No discount ring chasers will appear until Klay looks like a healthy allstar for 4 months, and they currently have close to $170 million in salaries next season. Wiseman + Wiggins + whatever 8th man they can get in the draft is better for the team than Siakam, and if Klay ends up being 65% of the player he used to be and Draymond isn't providing any offense, the warriors will probably be in the wilderness for at least a few years.  Curry - Klay - Draymond - Looney - Wiggins with Wiseman, Davion Mitchell, Poole and maybe Oubre or Bazemore off the bench (I don't think Oubre or bazemore is actually going to be possible unless they're willing to carry $185 million in salaries or something crazy like that) is far better than Curry - Klay - Draymond - Looney - Siakam with Poole and whatever they can get at veterans' minimums off the bench, especially if Klay isn't 100%."
"Makes sense for the raptors. Mobley and Davion Mitchell in the draft. Wiggins returns to Canada.   I assume Boucher is traded too? Makes little sense to have him and Wiseman starting together.  Warriors become heavy favorites to win the West. My only question is why not just try and go for KAT if you’re the warriors.  Green, Wiseman, 7th, 14th for KAT."
"If Lowry leaves, trading Siakam and getting Wiseman + Jalen Green + Davion Mitchell on the roster would be a pretty awesome start to a rebuild"

"Every player has games like that. Cade had 3 games out of 27 where he shot 25% or less. He shot 45% or better in 13 games and that's with a heavy dose of 3pt shooting.  His TS% was still 57%, with very poor spacing. And one of those ""worse"" performances was him dropping 25 on 16 shots against Davion Mitchell.  Yeah, I think we'll be fine with that."
Davion Mitchell teammates with Donovan Mitchell
I'm really hyped on Davion Mitchell and Josh Giddey
Just be happy we are not debating between Davion Mitchell and Moses Moody
"Seriously, just get whoever they don’t and never what if it.. Although I like trading down for davion Mitchell"
Depends on who's available at 9. Someone like Josh Giddey or Davion Mitchell might be tempting since the 76ers would need a PG if they trade Simmons.
Barnes feels like a very development prospect I think the warriors go davion Mitchell as he can help them right away
"See I understand where you’re coming from, but I guess we just have different opinions on player development. To me, if you’ve been able to turn draft day scraps into the supporting cast of a championship team, I’d say you’re better gambling on multiple players with great upside.   With Suggs, it feels weird that they’re drafting Suggs to essentially take the keys of their franchise to a rookie. And you gotta remember that no matter how sure a thing they are, there’s still no guarantee they’re actually better in the  long or even short term. Get Kuminga and a Davion Mitchell or maybe a Scottie Barnes or a Keon Johnson."
"Kings and Thunder fans what do y'all think about this trade?   Thunder: 6th pick   Kings: 9th and Bagley   Idk how much you Thunder fans value the 6th pick but it could get you Bagley and have him at center and might be improved with a change of scenery. Then puts you in position to draft a Keon Johnson(Saw your thread was interested), a Davion Mitchell, Kispert, Moody, Giddey, etc.   For the Kings fans I feel like the Bagley breakup is obv a long time coming and i'm not sure how high his trade value is. This puts you in position to get Scottie Barnes. A very versatile player."
"No, I’m saying that The Raptors have done well developing talent so it makes sense for them to bank on developing projects. So they’d be getting two picks but banking on upside. And a lot of the best players weren’t picked at the top of the draft. In fact on the championship raps team, I believe none of those guys were taken above like number 11 or something. Getting a Kuminga and maybe a Davion Mitchell or that guy Keon Johnson who just broke the record for his vertical at the combine.    the reality of the draft is that rookies don’t always come in and are ready to take over teams or live up to their hype on draft day. There’s always an apparent sure thing that we’re wrong about. It’s just the facts. Whereas Masai has found plenty of success just not missing on projects."
"I should say I could also see Toronto trying to move up to Two for Mobley if they could, or staying and taking the best available of course, but getting a project like Kuminga and a Davion Mitchell? Maybe even a Keon johnson(who o like because of his name) or that 6’9 euro guy?!"
It could be smart to stay put honestly. I doubt teams would give up that good a veteran for those picks in the off-season. They are in prime position to maybe get Davion Mitchell and Corey Kispert who would fill needs and should contribute right away.
"Every draft pick is hit or miss, last year Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Tyrese Haliburton, and Payton Prichard these are the types I am talking about. Chris Duarte, Trey Murphy III, Corey Kispert, James Bouknight, and Davion Mitchell. These are more seasoned then your typical one and dones."
Davion 🤝 Donovan  Being a steal of a Mitchell drafted at 13
Davion Mitchell at 13 would be robbery.
I've seen Davion Mitchell alot to the Warriors at 7. Seems Warrior fans prefer Moses over Davion.  Doubt Scottie Barnes lasts that long.
Yeah but Davion Mitchell is not it
"Post-lotto mock draft. I'm pretty much going BPA in my opinion, with some subjective considerations, particularly whether I think the team is going for high potential or high floor, and in some cases where multiple players are about the same talent tier, best fit.  1 - Detroit - Cade Cunningham   2 - Houston - Evan Mobley   3 - Cleveland - Jalen Green   4 - Toronto - Jalen Suggs   5 - Orlando - Jon Kuminga   6 - Oklahoma City - Scottie Barnes   7 - Golden State - Moses Moody   8 - Orlando - James Bouknight   9 - Sacramento - Jalen Johnson  10 - New Orleans - Davion Mitchell   11 - Charlotte -  Franz Wagner   12 - San Antonio - Alperen Sengun   13 - Indiana - Josh Giddey   14 - Golden State - Corey Kispert   15 - Washington - Keon Johnson   16 - Oklahoma City - Usman Garuba   17 - Memphis - Ziaire Williams   18 - Oklahoma City - Kai Jones  19 - New York - Cam Thomas  20 - Atlanta - Isaiah Jackson   21 - New York - Sharife Cooper  22 - Los Angeles Lakers - Chris Duarte  23 - Houston - Trey Murphy  24 - Houston - Tre Mann  25 - Los Angeles Clippers - Jaden Springer  26 - Denver - Greg Brown  27 - Brooklyn - Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  28 - Philadelphia - Miles McBride  29 - Phoenix - Day'Ron Sharpe  30 - Ayo Dosunmu"
Or Mobley for their roster composition. They can’t lose at 4. Tbh I want them to trade down and take davion Mitchell tho
Davion Mitchell would certainly be available at #3.
"Homer glasses on: Davion fucking Mitchell outta Baylor is the truth. Dude is clutch as hell and a great defender. Like, best defender in CBB great. Not a bad consolation prize"
I love Davion off night Mitchell but taking him at 4 would be a mistake. He was a second rounder before the NCAA finals.
Nobody is that dumb.  It's a 5 person draft with the 5th person being Kuminga who is the biggest boom or bust guy.  The top 4 are sure things Kuminga is a high upside guy who may be a bust.  He's either gonna be Kawhi Leonard or Josh Jackson.  He has no medium outcome.  We gotta take Davion Mitchell because he's an older rookie with upside.
"7th and 14th right?  monumental W imo. y’all will get two rotational players day 1 that have a high chance to play some real playoff minutes.  i’m guessing y’all take scottie barnes and davion mitchell, book it."
Why would you have Davion mitchell?
Dawg imagine Davion Mitchell breaking down the D kicks it out to Pool for 3 knocks it down while Steph and Klay celebrate on the bench… I can see it already
Inb4 Kuminga or Davion Mitchell
Bruh. Davion Mitchell is 22 already.
I love Davion Mitchell
Is Davion Mitchell more like Mikal Bridges or Michael Kidd-Gilchrist?
Lmao they said they'd do the draft after the break then start interviewing Davion Mitchell??
The Kings are drafting Davion Mitchell top 5
Kind of ice cold for Jay Bilas to say Davion Mitchell has a huge heart when his college teammate Jared Butler might not be allowed to play in the NBA because of the literal size of his heart.
Davion Mitchell and Jalen Green impress me more than Cunningham and Mobley
Davion Mitchell at 5??? idk about that one lol
davion mitchell impressed me whole lots
"Davion ""Waka Flocka"" Mitchell"
Davion Mitchell top 5?? Wtf???
Davion Mitchell at 5? idk about that
Davion Mitchell?
Why is Davion Mitchell and Keon Johnson projected so high. I don’t understand. I’d rather draft moody or bouknight
"At least we've still got Davion Mitchell, u/DavionMitchellStan"
You will draft Davion Mitchell and you will like it.
First y’all want them to trade De’Aaron Fox now Davion Mitchell 😭😂 mfs can never have anything nice LMAOO y’all swear Vlade is still at the helm 😂
im not going to name nuggets players since it wont be fun so  &amp;#x200B;  guard - Steph Curry  guard - Davion Mitchell  Forward - Larry Bird  Forward - Kevin Garnett  Center - Hakeem Olajuwon
im not going to name nuggets players since it wont be fun so  &amp;#x200B;  guard - Steph Curry  guard - Davion Mitchell  Forward - Larry Bird  Forward - Kevin Garnett  Center - Hakeem Olajuwon
"I agree with this, and I think it's because fixing team culture is the ownership/FO's priority more than X's and O's. George Karl and Dave Joerger were excellent X's and O's coaches and the players hated them. They've been trying to sign legit vets for the same reason, Trevor Ariza, Zach Randolph, Vince Carter, George Hill. Iggy said they tried to sign him to fix their locker room.  Also explains the Davion Mitchell pick. They need high character guys to turn the franchise culture around. Luke Walton is beloved by the players, and so I don't think he's going anywhere soon. Also why they are signing guys like Doug Christie to the assistant coaching spots."
Donovan Mitchell    Luka     Zion    KAT   Davion Mitchell   Embiid   Devin Booker
Davion Mitchell
"I mean he shot 3/12 in that game and a few sloppy plays but overall I thought he looked fine. Still had 7 dimes, few pull up 3s (2/5 on 3pa), only one turnover. His handle is actually really tight, he dribbles quickly and guards the ball well, he has a quick and effective crossover, utilizes step backs and side steps well. Here’s some highlights from his game against Washington, they show off more of what he can do. Granted, he mostly shoots jumpers off the dribble in this game, and in other games he did a lot more drives to the hoop and floaters.  [Davion Mitchell 19 pts, 4 ast vs. Washington](https://youtu.be/WnUMAsrcsO8)"
&gt;Ties in voting totals between Davion Mitchell and Payton Pritchard  lmao nice voting
Tell me you didn't watch Davion Mitchell without telling me you didn't watch Davion Mitchell
"""It's good! At the buzzer! Davion Mitchell! Are you kidding me!""  Yeah I think it fits."
"[Here's the list of past Summer League MVPs.](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/summer/1/NBA-Summer-League/0/awards)  Of the first-year players who have won it (goes back to 2006), it's just Randy Foye, Jerryd Bayless, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Damian Lillard, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Clark, and now Davion Mitchell and Cam Thomas. Interesting list of players."
Davion Mitchell is who Josh Jackson was supposed to pan out
"You need to understand that even if the small guy is the better defender, he might not be as valuable defensively as a wing/big with switchability, the way the league is going Davion might struggle against those 6'7"" jumbo playmakers that play the 1. But hopefully he'll outspeed them and destroy them on the other end which i personally don't think will happen.  You takes Scottie Barnes over Davion no question asked if we're just talking defense because he brings an equal level of team defense and can potentially guard 1 throught 5, Davion at best can guard 1 &amp; 2 consistently.  They're not random names Barnes and Mobley were scouted for years before you stanned Mitchell."
"fuck i was right that davion mitchell was good, fuck.  its okay pritchard, the bad man will only see you twice a season .  overall i am really excited about nesmith and pritchard getting bigger roles ideally, begarin was intriguing to say the least, i think him and madar (who didnt really show out as much as i thought he would have, granted i dont think he really got much of a shot) can lead the g-league team and hopefully be key role players next year. we should just let carsen go next chance we get and i still dont know what to think about langford, i guess g-league with the other two for now."
Or maybe he will be Davion Mitchell. A new breed of defender
Can't wait to see what 16 minutes a game of Davion Mitchell brings to the Kings this season.
Keep an eye on Davion Mitchell; I think the Kings have got themselves something special there—and very Tony Parker-esque.
What’s the highest score Davion Mitchell has ever allowed? Dude just seems so damn consistent defensively.
Davion “Off Night” Mitchell
Davion about to be the best D Mitchell in the league
"Davion Mitchell played him well 2 times and people think he 'locked up' payton pritchard. The funniest part of this game is when Pritchard got past Mitchell and misfired on the pass to the big man, the commentators said Mitchell 'sped him up' lol"
"They ran a box in one on him. Its his first time seeing that kind of defensive attention. You would be tired too after taking 60 shots a game over the last three days.  Davion Mitchell wasn't locking him up. It was the whole team, doubling him whenever possible"
"Dame is tiny by NBA standards but he's still a solid 6'1 or 6'2. And he's no ordinary 6'1 or 6'2 human being either based on pre draft measurements he has a 6'7 wingspan. That's why he can get shots off like that playoff game winner over a long wing like Paul George or how he can routinely finish at the rim with 7 footers around(of course speed and hesis and threat of the jump shot also plays a role in this)  Like I'm also 6'1 but even if I had Dame's shooting ability, handles, and that signature pound dribble step back in my bag I would get my shot smothered by Paul George and other NBA wings 9 times out of 10 cause my wingspan is only 6'0 and I have small hands for my height.  I do agree though that Dame prolly doesn't have what it takes to even be a somewhat good defender at the NBA level and that's a combination of many reasons. Some short guys can guard though like Lowry, FVV, and now the man of the hour Davion Mitchell."
"Two things I've learned from watching nothing but Celtics games this summer league:  * Payton Pritchard is too good for Summer League * Davion Mitchell is too good for Payton Pritchard  I'm really happy with what I saw from our young guys, but y'all have a hell of a player."
It’s the Davion Mitchell effect.
"Man, early on when y’all were up like 12-2 I thought the Kings were completely outclassed. And then Davion Mitchell flipped some kind of switch and everything changed."
Davion Mitchell might be a steal
He'd be one of the best players on our team. Davion Mitchell is so good.
Davion Mitchell wasn't guarding him when he dropped 92
I wish I was in a prison shower with davion mitchell
"\*Mitchell guards Pritchard well on 2 possessions\* ""Davion Mitchell is locking up Payton Pritchard and the Kings are taking his Pro-Am performance as motivation"""
"First Davion Mitchell, now this?"
Then they need Donovan Mitchell and Davion Mitchell and the trifecta is complete
"Yeah, who the fuck wants to watch the team with the best regular season record last year, they'll probably be a dumpster fire next season. Do they even have any good players worth watching? What a complete waste of Christmas game. We should get some actual good teams with players people know for that day. Maybe a team with Davion Mitchell or something."
"I just don't see how we make it happen in Sacramento. We aren't trading Fox, I'd imagine Haliburton is off the table. Leaves Buddy for salary, maybe Davion Mitchell. But I imagine the Sixers want a contributor right away. I don't see it."
"Personally I'm excited about Kuminga, I don't know how to add a flair (I'm on mobile) but the warriors are my team and having a young force who can take it to the rim more as well as being a three level scorer and showing defensive strengths is exciting. I can see us trading Moody somewhere with picks for a win now type of player we more desperately need though. From other teams I found cam Thomas to be a bit of a surprise as well as Davion Mitchell but how Sacramento is going to arrange their backcourt seems like a predicament for them."
"Glad to see Davion Mitchell with an A. The Kings tricked me into watching their Summer League games by putting Alex Antetokounmpo on the roster, and Mitchell looked great when I saw him."
"I think the most discussed offer was Buddy, Bagley, the #9 pick, and possibly more 1st round picks, which the 76ers probably should have taken.  Now that the Kings have selected Davion Mitchell, and he's shown to be an absolute monster on perimeter and man to man defense, they are probably more likely to see if that works first before mortgaging the farm get Simmons."
They'll probably want Davion Mitchell over Bagley
"I think the Kings would have to offer something like Harrison Barnes, Mo Harkless and either Davion Mitchell / Haliburton"
Yeah that’s why you always take bpa and not due to fit. That’s why the kings took Davion Mitchell this year because they learned from their mistakes.
"Massive reach does not = not liking the pick.   I’m a Kings fan who initially didn’t like the Davion Mitchell pick because we have two guards already. Doesn’t mean I thought Mitchell was a reach at 9 or wouldn’t have been a fan of it for another team.    Yeesh, buddy, get it together with your reading comprehension skills and false equivalencies!"

Scottie Barnes. Jalen Green. Jonathan Kuminga. Davion Mitchell. Tre Murphy
Davion Mitchell
What's funny is Fox in only 8.5 months older than Davion Mitchell.
"When Davion was Mcbrides age he was red shirting. When he was a year older he put up significantly worse numbers than McBride did this year. What makes a you say Mitchell has more potential? Also Mitchell is a better defender but not ""way"" better."
"We really don’t know if Davion Mitchell is good at all yet, he hasn’t played an NBA game.  He’s an awesome defender, but so is Jevon Carter"
"It's fun watching other teams wheel and deal their stars, I guess. Either way, it's not really a problem until it's an actual problem. We played Cory Joseph 21 minutes a game last year. We also played Fox, Hield, and Haliburton together in 50 games (Fox and Haliburton injuries prevented more) last year averaging 12 minutes per game. We'll find time for Davion Mitchell.  We're high on Mitchell right now, but we don't KNOW how good he's going to be against NBA guards. We don't know how quickly he'll adjust. We don't know when he's going to hit the rookie wall. We don't know whether we're going to have injuries that free up more time or whether Mitchell himself is going to get hurt and not need the time. We don't know whether he'll even DESERVE that much playing time. We don't know whether this is going to be a problem yet, but lots of people seem to want to solve it."
"Why wouldn’t the Kings just use Mitchell as a sixth man who plays 36 a night? There’s 96 minutes a night between the two guard spots, throw in some minutes at the 3 for Haliburton and you’ve got 36+ for each of Fox/Hali/Davion. If he’s even worth That- summer league is promising but doesn’t really tell us anything yet"
Joke’s on you NBA. This loss got us Davion Mitchell.
"I think people need to reassess what the expected return should be for a mid to late lotto pick. If Davion Mitchell is the kings version of Marcus Smart, it's a good pick, even with Fox/Haliburton ahead of him."
"Kai Jones, kuminga, THT, Nix, Kispert, reddish, Davion Mitchell, Bagley"
"What a surprise, Davion Mitchell in another championship game"
Davion Mitchell
"there are some very good defenders in the SL. i don’t think anyone is going off for 50 against davion mitchell or deuce mcbride, especially when they have 10 fouls before they’re out. plus the superstar will be doubled the entire time if the rest of the team is made up of summer league players."
"Can we propose Haliburton or Davion Mitchell? If we assume Fox will be a star : while three guards can be productive, you can't have 3 stars."
I think Davion Mitchell is a star.
"Hasn’t player yet, but Davion Mitchell. He’s legit the best on ball defender I’ve ever watched in college and I think his improvement in his jumped is legit and it wasn’t a fluke. Had him right there with Suggs in terms of draft rankings. Also has very under appreciated play making. Dude is Jrue Holiday 2.0 if you ask me"
I agree. Davion Mitchell is going to be MVP caliber in his 3rd or 4th season.
"Pre-draft people were comparing Davion Mitchell to Marcus Smart, and god do I hope that pans out—I fucking LOVE Marcus Smart.  (The Jrue Holiday comps are cool too)"
I always read Davion Mitchell as Donovan Mitchell and   have to reread post titles a lot.
Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell
He said huge reach and we all know Davion Mitchell is gonna be a star
Username does not check out. Should have been Davion Mitchell smh
We don't doubt Davion Mitchell. We doubt the Sacramento Kings
Davion Mitchell or Darius garland
Im pretty high on Davion Mitchell  I think more elite role player than star however
"I love McBride, but he shouldn’t be compared to Davion. It’s funny, people used to clown me for saying Davion would be one of the best players in the draft but I got roasted for saying he’s too short to be good, but look at him now playing like Donovan Mitchell.  Point, Mitchell has more upside than McBride, that being a way better defender and a slightly better scorer. The only thing holding Mitchell is that for some reason he sucks at free throws, which I hope fixes. Last thing any person, is for him to be the next Ben Simmons. McBride definitely has the potential though"
davion mitchell for the kings will actually improve their team more than people think
Jrue DPOY and Davion Mitchell 2nd team all D
"Oooh, I’ll add another homer hot take on this comment: Davion Mitchell turns out to be a great pick and people realize not only that Divac is gone, but that the current FO is actually not terrible."
Davion Mitchell Roy
Davion Mitchell will lead to one of Fox/Haliburton getting traded
So far from these SL it looks like I’m wrong on Davion.. I thought he’s gonna be Avery Bradley with better handles and shot making.. but some of the shit he’s doing is Donovan Mitchell lite
Being guarded by Davion Mitchell probably feels like hell
"&gt;Would you like Tucker to defend a young and athletic SF all game? That’s where the liability is. Like Draymond, his value as a defender is that he’s switchable but ideally not someone you stick to athletic wings. Would he (Draymond) make the Kings better as the starting SF over Barnes? The Kings don’t have elite perimeter (though Davion Mitchell may change that) and post defenders like the Bucks do so they wouldn’t be able to get away with starting him there."
They just need to get Davion Mitchell and then all the pieces will be in place
"Soft on defense, not like my guy davion Mitchell"
They need to get guys who can shoot and defend. I know they traded their pick but I though Davion Mitchell would have been a great fit for them
"""I'm not a pizza guy""  \- Davion Mitchell"
MJ called him up and said “Davion Mitchell isn’t gonna be guarding you in the next game” and Bouknight was all good after that
"I got downvoted to shit bc I disagreed with some Kings fans that said that Davion Mitchell is like a top 5 defender in the league now, after 1 summer league game"
"Davion MItchell has impressed on both ends. He has no weaknesses   Josh Christopher’s defense and aggressive driving stood out  Cade’s poise and feel for the game is special   Jalen Green is a baller. Elite shot maker and has real combo guard potential  Deuce McBride is gonna be really good on both ends. His wingspan will frustrate guys  Sengun  Kuminga does not look as raw as I thought he would  Suggs is not just a transition guy. He’s good in half court and is a pest on defense  Mobley looks really raw but he needs to play with a guard, he can’t create for himself yet  Scottie Barnes is still raw offensively but the defensive tools are crazy  Sharife Cooper might be the steal of the draft, if he can really shot 3s, it’s over. He won’t get the PT he needs in Atlanta tho  Jalen Johnson should not have fallen to 20. Front offices really thought he randomly quit on Duke smh"
Primo + Sengun surprised the most they look like early lottery selections type talent on display. Davion Mitchell was less of a surprise but he impressed me too.  I think i'd be very worried if I am detroit that Green &gt;&gt;&gt; Cade.  Green looks like a super beast  honestly it would not shock me if Rockets make play in
Davion Mitchell
"He's just a bigger, younger Davion Mitchell. Their draft spots made no sense to me"
"Yes I've seen him play, he has great defense. Lots of players in the G League and college are good at defense though, that alone does not make you an NBA player. Davion Mitchell is also amazing defensively but he doesn't get drafted this year without his offense."
Suggs and Davion Mitchell were crazy on d.
"I guess I respect OP going against the grain and not just predicting chalk like most people, but Sengun and Davion Mitchell are likely going to make OP look silly."
"Yeah, the Kings worked him out, so he was being considered for the 9th pick, and I was expecting to hear the name of Moody/Sengun/Bouknight when Adam Silver announced our pick, but was surprised that it ended up being Davion Mitchell."
Davion ''Off Night'' Mitchell
"Leading up to the draft, I used to get so much shit, for saying Davion Mitchell was one of the best in this draft. Now here he is."
Zion is a year younger than Davion Mitchell.
Jaren Jackson Jr is younger than the following 2021 1st round draft picks:  * Davion Mitchell * Chris Duarte * Corey Kispert
"Davion Mitchell is a good example of this. Not saying he will be bad, just that he has more experience"
Any decent 2 or 3 in the playoffs will shoot over him or postup. Booker / Mitchell / MPJ / PG / Kawhi / KD / Middleton / Tobias / Jimmy would work either him or Curry if they’re on the floor together. Our best lineup if we had Davion would need Klay and Wiggins at 3/4 and we have no idea if Klay can be elite D anymore
"more time to develop. davion Mitchell and franz Wagner would not have been 1st round picks in the 2020 nba draft, and thus wouldn’t get any guaranteed money"
Davion Mitchell will cement himself into this conversation very soon
Kawhi for me.  For college it was Davion Mitchell this year - dude is insane
Davion Mitchell wins ROY.
"Davion Mitchell becomes the best PG on the Kings, overtaking Fox and Hali"
-Giannis wins MVP -Myles Turner wins DPOY -Davion Mitchell wins ROY -Lakers lose in second round -Suns run it back and win Finals -Bucks and Hawks ECF again
Wait until Davion Mitchell is also on this list lol
"Sixers get: Hield, Brogdon + Kings first  Kings get: Simmons, Jeremy Lamb  Pacers get: Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell"
Now I kinda want to see Davion Mitchell get 36 minutes against LaVine.
Bobby Jackson had to tell Davion to stop going so hard in summer league because he was having knee problems and wouldn't stop. dude is either going to be a maniac or will break down hard like 25 games into the season.  [source](https://sports.yahoo.com/davion-mitchell-relying-on-unmatched-work-ethic-to-make-statement-with-kings-205251563.html)
"Since Simmons wants to be in California.  And john wall is the biggest name out there for a trade. I got a realistic trade ?   Sixers get wall, Heild , Davion Mitchell &amp; kings 2022 1st round pick  Rockets get sixers 2022 first round pick &amp; bagley  Kings get Simmons"
"Mitchell would be a perfect trade piece for Sacramento. You trade his great defense for a better/bigger defender that can anchor your whole team and not just the point of the attack. You can build an entire defense around Simmons, Davion is too small to do that. I think he’ll be great but I think it would be dumb to hold up the trade for Mitchell. It’s like Sixers losing out on Harden because they didn’t want to trade Maxey"
"Davion Mitchell probably wouldn't, but if you thing Hield wouldn't, you're on crack."
Young guard davion Mitchell only 2 years younger than Simmons
These Simmons threads have become my favorite thing to read because of how much tighter each teams fans become around who they wouldn’t trade for Simmons.   My favorite today was a can’t trade Davion Mitchell in a Simmons package comment.
"It's a risky move but the kings have nothing to lose. I think the Kings are a playoff team if they make that trade, you'd have a starting lineup of fox, haliburton, barnes, Simmons, and holmes with Davion Mitchell as your 6th man."
"Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, and a protected 1st.  Kings fans may be high on Davion Mitchell but  Fox/ Haliburton/ Simmons/ Barnes/ Holmes is a legit starting 5 that can finally get into the playoffs."
But is Joel ok with Beasley and picks for a DPoY-level teammate? Is he ok with Hield and Davion Mitchell as his core to win a championship? Neither are good options.  Sixers are caught between a cock and a hard dick
"&gt; You cant be a top ~~3~~ 10 pick cause you're good at defense against smaller college guards alone. Davion was a 6'0"" PG with a loose handle, limited explosiveness, and bad lateral movement/awareness on offense. He can't run that pick n roll and can't pass that well either. He is aight at getting to the basket and not good at drawing fouls.  Not saying Davion Mitchell is going to be a good player (I'm about 99% sure he won't be), but teams/an owner will somehow always overlook obvious flaws and problems at the NBA level because they've been watching too much March Madness. Happens every year."
"Dunno what they're gonna do with Davion Mitchell (I know he's a good defender, but are they really gonna put him on the floor with Fox?), but they've got a ton of young guard talent"
"A bigger problem is that people don't understand how math models work. It isn't there to play I hope Klay is all-star levels of good again. It takes the previous season and figures out what's the chances of them performing like that.   They have Tyrese Haliburton as up and comer and Davion Mitchell as OK prospect. Tyrese is looking like a longer CP3 and Davion is a top 5 on ball defender already.   These things do not coincide with people's projections because math models do not take into consideration, ""I feel like this dude is gonna be good."""
"PG: Chris Paul, Davion Mitchell SG: Devin Booker, Lu Dort SF: Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac PF: Draymond Green, Christian Wood C:   Joel Embiid, Al Horford"
"Fox,Haliburton,Davion Mitchell, Jalen Green, Cade,Zion, Luka, Lamelo"
Davion Mitchell nods in agreement.
"He can create. He won SEC freshman of the year, and made first team. He lead his own team in scoring. He is an overall player than just a pure scorer or shooter.   But he is totally okay with deferring to the top scorer on the team. The main thing is that he is 19, and so it’s hard to say what his ceiling is.   I get it though, bias aside, he isn’t showing star potential. Still, Davion Mitchell, Chris Duarte and Wagner went ahead of him, who, imo, have just as many question marks."
Davion Mitchell needs to play 30+ minutes per game
Davion Mitchell will be the first guard since Payton to win it.
Option 1: CJ  Option 2: Harrison Barnes and either Hali/Davion Mitchell
"Can you imagine, the Davion Mitchell Jrue backcourt defense must be a cancer to deal with"
"I don't know why my brain made that substitute, I meant Mr. ""Off-night"", Davion Mitchell"
"From a Kings fan perspective: I think Fox is the better player right now.  I think that Haliburton will out perform Simmons over the next 5 years.  But, some in the Kings fanbase are balking at trading a 23 year old 6'0"" tall rookie for Simmons, and while I understand wanting to see what Davion Mitchell can be, it's dumb to refuse to trade him.   Simmons is only 2 years older than Davion Mitchell, we already have 2 guards to build around, and Simmons is already NBA elite at perimeter defense, and perimeter defense is what Davion is supposed to be best at.    I know nothing about how good Sexton or Garland project to be, I watched at most 2 Cavs games last year, but I understand the feeling."
"Facts bro, Barnes is trash. We shoulda picked Sengun or Davion Mitchell over a glorified Anthony Bennett"
"Oh that’s a somewhat different question than the one in your post. There sometimes is a player (Zion a few years ago) who can come into the league and be a top 50 player instantly, but I would say the 10 best college basketball players would be like ranked mostly 100-300 if you rate them with NBA players. I believe Cade probably would be ranked around 70th (it’s a long list so that’s just my estimate - for reference Westbrook is around 35 and Draymond is around 45 and Rozier is probably around 70). After Cade, the next best college basketball players are probably going to be ranked 100+ (Jalen Green might be ranked 90-100, if you include G leaguers). Davion Mitchell might be the most NBA ready college prospect not named Cade or Green, and he’s probably around 120.   Btw this answer would be way different 20 years ago and definitely 40 years ago when college basketball players weren’t all one and dones. When MJ came into the league in 1984, MJ would have already been a top 5 player (he lead the league in total points as a rookie). Hakeem would have been a top 15 player and Barkley and Perkins probably both top 50 players."
Okay and based on the upside Davion Mitchell could become Chris Paul.  Every prospect looks great when you set no realistic expectations
I know you did not just say that. Mitchell has Lowry 2.0 potential with even better defense. Not one is taking THT over Davion even when going solely off of upside. If Pelinka could straight up swap THT for Mitchell he would.
Davion Mitchell is a 6’ 23 year old rookie…   I think most NBA GMs would tell you THT has far more upside.
"Hell no, I said I’d take him around 11. Definitely before Bouknight and Davion Mitchell."
"Hornets because they remind me of the hawks 2 years ago( slightly better but imo not as much upside).   Sacramento because i love defenders and i wanna see how davion mitchell plays against the best in the world. i wanted hali in the draft too.  Warriors cause steph, and klay returning. mostly because of steph tho"
I saw Colin Sexton cook Trae Young in college and really thought Trae was gonna be on his way to China on a few years. I'll admit i was a little wrong there. Apparently I saw Davion Mitchell play for Auburn but I don't remember him being anything special. Apparently he decided to take basketball more seriously after facing Sexton and stepped his training up.
Davion Mitchell is here to stay.
"Hypothetical trade and something to build off, and I'm sure a 3rd team would love to get in on something like this.  Kings receive: Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton (Maxey if Paul forces it) 76ers receive: Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, Harrison Barnes &amp; Bagley (or picks)   Kings DeAron Fox (showtime with Ben), Tyrese Haliburton, ?, Ben Simmons, Holmes   76ers Maxey, Hield, Thybulle (or Barnes), Harris, Embiid  Mitchell, Curry, Green, Barnes, Niang, Drummond"
I don’t see how that’s awful for Boston. Boston should believe they can develop Davion into a short Marcus Smart and he’s on a cheaper deal then they’re getting multiple Kings picks which could become quite valuable on top of that. That’s low key a steal for the Celtics. As for the Sixers Smart isn’t worth missing out on Mitchell and multiple potential top 10 picks.
"So let’s throw all the cap issues out the window. You’re telling me  - that Marcus Smart and multiple picks is worth Davion Mitchell? I doubt either team likes that deal  - that Philadelphia sacrifices multiple potential lottery picks so they can get Marcus Smart? Smart isn’t worth that much  - that the Kings give up Hield, Bagley, Mitchell and a lot of picks to get Simmons and picks most likely in the 20s. That’s too much for Simmons’ current value  And then ofc Smart can’t be traded rn and that’s actually too much salary for the Sixers."
"Sacramento had a historically bad defense last year.   Whatever the cause of that was (coaching, personnel, effort), I don't know that they did anything to address it this off-season.   Sure, they got Davion Mitchell and some vets who might be able to help on D, but their core group of guys who struggled on defense are still the core they will trot out this year."
I'm not gonna say anything bout my team because I'm obviously biased but out of all the teams listed I feel like the Kings are getting underrated here.  Their starting lineup was pretty solid and their team is still pretty young so I can see someone like Haliburton taking a leap.  Davion Mitchell is also more likely than the average lottery pick to be immediately impactful.
damn nice of him to give a shoutout to that dawg ~~Davion Mitchell~~ Jevon Carter
If you replace Seth Curry with Davion Mitchell or maybe even Matisse Thybulle they would be my favorites.
"Davion Mitchell, Bagley, Hield and 2 firsts for Ben"
"Kings GM here.    Because I know Ben Simmons has played his hand and wants out of Philly and to end up with a Cali team ultimately,  I’ll give you Buddy, MB3, and Davion Mitchell."
I honestly think it all depends on how Luke Walton utilizes Davion Mitchell during the first few weeks of the season because his job will hopefully depend on it.
Reading this and feeling slightly less crazy that I think it could be Davion Mitchell or Alperen Sengun
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
"I’m betting on San Antonio.   I think it’ll eventually come down to CJ or a package of rotational players and picks. I think Philly will opt for the package of players to try and recoup possible future assets for a bigger trade. When it gets to that point the 3 teams I see bidding against each other are Minnesota, Sacramento, and San Antonio.   When comparing deals for these teams I’m going to assume a few guys are just off limits so those being De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Karl-Anthony Towns, D’Angelo Russell, Anthony Edwards, and Dejounte Murray.   To keep everything fair for hypothetical reasons I’ll say each team trades a unprotected pick, protected pick and a swap along a starter level player, rotational player, and a player on a rookie deal. So deals of something like;  Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels, Taurean Prince, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 pick, 2025 swap   Derrick White, Devin Vassell, Thaddeus Young, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap   Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, Marvin Bagley?, 2022 top 5 1st, 2024 1st, 2025 swap.  Looking at it like this I would instantly rule out Minnesota. I think they have the worst collection of players here (outside of McDaniels I’d probably take him over Mitchell and Vassell but it’s not a large gap at all) and when it comes to future value of those picks I think they’d be a playoff team and those picks would project to be late teens to mid 20 picks. Along side that Minnesota virtually has nothing of value to add to compete against other offers other than picks, and their whole team is just consisted of 4 players.   That leaves it between Sacramento and San Antonio. To me both teams add something of value to Philly SAS gives them a Swiss Army knife half court ball handler, SAC gives them a high level floor spacer, and to me Mitchell and Vassell are equal in value and have similar skillsets despite playing different positions. I think the main swing factor here is if Sacramento throws in Harrison Barnes or not. If Harrison banes is replaced with Bagley I’ll go Sacramento without a doubt, but if not I don’t see what other quality rotational or player with value sac can really add to entice Morey (I wouldn’t take Bagley or TT over Thaddeus Young). Unlike Minnesota I think despite adding Simmons both teams could still realistically miss the playoffs which makes those draft picks more valuable, and I think both teams can take the depth hit when trading Quantity for Quality. I think even more so San Antonio can with how many players they have still on rookie deals, and if needed to they could probably throw in even more players like Walker IV or more picks like the bulls one they just got.   Did I just damn near write an essay on Ben Simmons trade destinations? Yes. Is it flawed? Probably am I bored? Also yes"
"Buddy Heild, Davion Mitchell and a bunch of picks."
Some super weird Spurs/Kings/Philly trade where whoever out of the Spurs and Kings that didn't get Simmons looks absolutely fleeced.   ------------------------------  Something like...   Simmons to Kings  Hield + Derrick White + picks to 76ers  Bagley and Davion Mitchell to the Spurs
"Last gm drafted him and with Casey as the couch it was a poor situation; Sekou was a raw prospect but Casey doesn't want to give guys the minutes to develop. Bad team or not, Casey wants to do everything he can to win the game in front of him. Then Jerami Grant, who plays the same position, became the de facto franchise player. Saddiq Bey is older and more developed than Sekou; his skillset is what you want from a role player, so he naturally jumped in the rotation.   Sekou also dealt with random injuries like concussions that kept him out and missed valuable learning minutes because of the pandemic. Remember that between March and December of 2020, he didn't play organized basketball.   His summer league wasn't good. He had a big game but for the most part he blended into the court. You're expecting more from a 3rd year player in summer league. On the other hand, he's still only 20 years old. For comparison: Saddiq Bey (22), Jalen Smith (21),  De'Andre Hunter (23), Brandon Ingram (23), Davion Mitchell (23), Chris Duarte (24), Tey Murphy (21), Ayo Dosunmu (22), Pascal Siakam (27). I don't think it's fair to write him off yet, but if he's going to grow it wasn't going to be in Detroit."
"Bagley can still be a very good player. His major issue is health. Even when he’s playing he hasn’t been 100%, and the loss of time in his developmental years is a killer.   But he’s only 22. People are gushing about guys like Davion Mitchell who were just drafted and older than Bagley.   Give it time."
"Exactly. Davion will probably be good right now but when looking at him relatively to his draft class, the other lottery picks will be starting their third or even fourth year at the same age Mitchell is starting his rookie year. I wouldn’t feel too bad about giving him up for a guy that can get you into the playoffs."
"I like Davion Mitchell, but keep in mind he turns 23 in 3 days.  He's *much* further along from a development arc than your average lottery pick.  Thus that means he's both more NBA ready now but with a realistic lower ceiling than one might think by watching how he played in summer league or will likely play right away in the NBA.  Not to say there isn't plenty of improvement and not to say he won't be a really good player.  But odds are you're not giving up the next great superstar in Davion."
"I like Davion Mitchell, I really do.   Projecting him as a PG of the future on a team that has no viable perimeter initiator is a different level of malpractice."
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
"The Kings finished 2 games outside of the play-in. Adding Simmons and Davion Mitchell would 1000% get them into the playoffs. Simmons finished 2nd in DPOY voting and Mitchell is considered the best defender in the draft. Next to a scorer like Fox and knock down 3pt shooters like Buddy and Hali, that team would be dangerous. Add to that, the Spurs made the play-in last year and it’s unlikely they do that again.  &gt; Plus they'd already have gotten two picks from the Sixers plus Thybulle and maybe Maxey.  I didn’t understand this part of your comment, sorry. Maybe I’m spacing out. Who is they?  Edit: Oh one last thing. I didn’t mean to say they would be better than the Nets. But if we’re talking 4 #30 picks or 2 #20 picks, I’ll take the 4 picks."
"So wait, elite defense and non-shooting makes Davion a failure but Simmons a perfect fit? At small forward? LOL. You don’t know basketball if you think Simmons is a 3 and we’re suddenly trading Barnes &amp; Fox (salaries don’t even match lmao) for a dude who’s unplayable in the 4th quarter. You’re the same dude that said we should trade Fox and START Mitchell.  You are either an idiot or a troll &amp; I don’t have the patience to find out tbh. Maybe watch a Kings game and stop looking at basketball reference for basic FG% as your only argument 💕"
"Trade Suggestion: Ben Simmons   Sixers get: Buddy Hield, Davion Mitchell, future first rd pick  Kings get: Ben Simmons, Tyrese Maxey, 2nd rd pick  What do you think?"
"Maybe I'm a homer, but I genuinely think Markelle can be way better than that. Warriors Livingston was a role player, and I think Markelle is fully capable of being a borderline All-Star+, even if his shot never returns to his college days.  He's a force in transition, and basically gets to the rim at will. If you sag off, he can still attack and hit the midrange - he's not Ben Simmons. He is an excellent playmaker and ball handler, and has great size. People are way too down on him honestly, 19-20 was basically his rookie year and he was an efficient and effective 4th/5th option. If you look back at any of the gamethreads from 20-21 before he got hurt, they are full of fans from the *opposing team* talking about how good Markelle looks, and saying he looks like 'he's back.'  It's frustrating seeing people shit on him but they have only looked at his stats, and didn't actually *watch* him play. He's only had 1 actual season under his belt, and he's only a few months older than Davion Mitchell, but people act like he's borderline retired and totally washed.  If the shot gets better that will be great, but I really think he can average 20/8 regardless - maybe not this year with having to ease back in from the ACL but the year after. He is imo every bit as talented as a Ja Morant or De'Aaron Fox, he just hasn't had the same opportunity and health. When he gets back healthy, and the offense runs through him, I think a lot of people will be eating crow."
"Besides the rookie contract and player skill set reasons.... Hali is absolutely beloved here in Sac. The last time we traded a beloved player and good locker room guy (Shumpert), our guys were devastated and the team chemistry tanked. Hali is an incredible player that wants to be here. That shit matters to us. With Davion Mitchell also coming in, there's a culture shift going on in the organization that I do NOT want to fuck up. I'm fucking tired of KANGZ.  We can make this work organically if we give them some time. If buddy, Bagley and picks aren't enough, so be it"
"Fair enough, I just was talking about what I'd specifically like. I feel like you have a crowded guard situation though; adding Davion Mitchell feels like someone has got to go."
davion mitchell + Buddy hield
"Honestly I could see it being a 3 team trade where you guys send CJ to Philly, we send Hield to you guys, along with 2 FRPs (maybe Davion Mitchell?) and us getting Simmons. You guys get a player to replace CJ and additional assets and more flexibility to make other moves, while the 76ers get a playmaking guard."
"I personally would trade Fox. Davion Mitchell, Haliburton and Simmons would be great together."
You will take Hield+Davion Mitchell and like it.
"Goodbye getting an all star and a bunch of picks.    Hield and Davion Mitchell for Simmons right about now.   Heck, Hield."
"lmao you call his trade idea unrealistic but you think the Kings would even think of giving up Davion Mitchell?? the fuck are you thinking?  There is a -1000% chance the Kings give up Mitchell now. Same with Ant and Minnesota and all those trade requests. What kinda braindead take.  Hield, Barnes, Bagley and a pick is one of the best offers Philly’s gonna get. Maybe they can get Brogdon, a pick (and TJ Warren? Pacers shopping him too) or CJ, Nasir Little and a pick, but nothing better than that."
Monte Mcnair is not trading Tyrese Haliburton nor Davion Mitchell he is not Vlade Divac God Bless 🙏🙏
"I think *ideally* for Philly, and **this is a longshot to happen** is a trade to the Raptors for OG and FVV.  Ben has a lot of faults, but the two things he can provide are ball-handling and defending the opponent's best player. Having both of those duties for 1 player is huge and to realistic replace those duties it'd require 2 players back. FVV and OG provide that.  A shittier version of that would be one of Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and Harrison Barnes.   That's always been my issue with a CJ trade - Philly is going to kick and scream to get Robert Covington back too because if Ben's gone - who's going to defend the 3 on the 76ers? Old-ass Danny Green?"
"That's a pretty awful return for Simmons  I've been looking into Sac/Philly trades but it's kind of tricky matching that 30M that you need in salary. I imagine that they'd have to get Harrison Barnes back.  I kind of like the idea of Harrison Barnes, Davion Mitchell and TT."
"Age is one of the big factors, but there are other factors. For example Davion Mitchell is considered a low ceiling but high floor type of player. He’s relatively older in age, but he’s NBA ready from his college success. He also has a high floor due to his defense which keeps him on NBA rosters (at worst he could be like Patrick Beverley which is pretty good floor). A player like Kumimga is one of the youngest players in the draft but his athleticism and flashes he has displayed at his young age gives him a higher ceiling. His floor is way lower because he’s just not as good of a player as Mitchell right now, and there’s nothing that guarantees he will be better."
"Jimmy buckets. Giannis. Lebron. Jrue Holiday.  Younger guys, Trae Young, Davion Mitchell, Luka."
I really like davion Mitchell with his style of play but idk not sure if I want to be miserable 😂
"But if he can't play defense, why does his size even matter? Might has well have Davion Mitchell play Center Or Power Forward for them."
"Davion Mitchell, Tyler Herro, Donovan Mitchell"
Davion Mitchell Pat Beverly Marcus Smart
"If the Kings offered Hield, Bagley and Davion Mitchell the Sixers would be dumb to turn it down."
Davion mitchell or haliburton would be reasonable imho.. but i doubt hali is up for a trade
"Davion Mitchell  Peak Matthew Dellavedova  Jrue Holiday  Lead guards with an elbow centric off ball game, a three point shot that at least demands respect, and an ability to get to the basket with a simple hesi and a shoulder down. They play very close, full court defense against opposing perimeter players and are vocal leaders on the defensive end."
"Nah, they're just waiting until Davion Mitchell is trade eligible."
Once the season starts it's Davion Mitchell and his Off Night nickname.   Amazing name for a defender.
Davion Mitchell!!
Future DPOY Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell
Just a few that I like  Dame Time; Joker; The Klaw; The Paw (Patrick Williams); Time Lord; Off-Night (Davion Mitchell); Khash Money; Slim Reaper/Durantula; Uncle Drew; Web Embiid
"solely as a nickname, off-night for Davion Mitchell is pretty cool, hopefully he can earn it in the league.Someone who's earned theirs is Dame with Dame Time, thats pretty cool that you can be named literally after the 'Clutch'"
"Off Night!   Davion Mitchell. Sacramento. Rookies probably shouldn’t come into the league with nicknames, but this is so great."
"im not biased at all but marcus smart.  other than that, maybe davion mitchell depending on how his defense translates to nba defenses, matisse maybe, there is probably s couple other guys im forgetting."
Jrue and maybe in a few years Davion Mitchell
"He's only been running the Kings a short time.  He was part of the screw up on the Bogdanović sign and trade, but every other move looks good (solid trades, good draft picks in Haliburton and Davion Mitchell)."
"&gt; The Kings have a logjam at guard with Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Davion Mitchell and Buddy Hield  if only they weren't forced at gunpoint to keep drafting guards even though there were good non-guard prospects on the board and they already had good guards"
"Even though fox is probably just as valuable as an asset and simmons is risky I still think the trade could end up making some sense. If Davion Mitchell pans out as a higher end starter, a backcourt of Davion and Halliburton defensively could be insane. Throw simmons in that mix and that’s a very interesting trio to build a defense around. Obviously they’d have to get some of the glue guys/floor spacers in between"
"I'd rather have Fox, but if Davion Mitchell ends up looking good this year, things could get a little clunky trying to play Fox, Haliburton, and Davion. At least with Ben you can make him play power forward.   Still rather than Fox though."
"Warriors: I have no idea what Klay will look like. I think they could fall anywhere between 2nd-6th seed.  Nets: How good can they be if everyone is actually healthy? It’s a big if considering how Harden looked in the playoffs, how often Irving is injured and how miraculously well Durant played coming off injuries.   Sixers: Joel Embiid has oft been injured and last year, he could have won MVP had he been healthy all year. Will they have Simmons? How’s that all going to work out after everybody on the team expressed their frustration with him, but they can’t trade him for more than peanuts?  Lakers: How many seasons does LeBron realistically have left? This reminds me of that Lakers team with Payton and Malone. They’re so old.  Pelicans and Wolves: I don’t know if either of these teams with their exciting young talent can actually play enough defense to win. I think Valenciunas will be huge for the Pels. That guy makes every team he’s on significantly better.  Heat: I think we will be a tough out, but our guard depth is not great. I feel like Herro is going to play a lot of point unless we make some other move.  Boston: I’m glad Horford is back with them. He is either utilized incredibly well or horribly. I’m glad he’s on a team who knows how to play him.  Pacers: They’re always good, but never great and absolutely never all healthy at once.  Kings: Davion Mitchell looked so great defensively in Summer League. I’m really hoping they can do something.  Hawks: I have no idea if they will continue with their playoff momentum or be a 6th-8th seed.   Some teams I think probably won’t be great:   Mavs seem the exact same. Idk why I would expect them to do anymore than get out of the first round at most. Kristaps knees seem to be forever plagued with “soreness”.   Wizards: They’ll need everyone to step up to make the playoffs with improved Bulls/Pacers/Celtics teams.  Raptors: I’m hoping somewhat selfishly as someone who went to FSU that Scottie Barnes is the truth. He kind of reminds me of Paul Pierce if Paul Pierce was a much less good shooter. Good court vision, solid defender, can handle a little bit and his game isn’t really dictated on athleticism, so if good, he could have a really long career."
"*Write a couple sentences about what you like about* r/nba *and what is something you would change?*      I love how r/nba has a diversity of content, when I'm bored of ben simmons or kyrie irving rumors I can read in-depth analysis on [The Impact of Strip Clubs on James Harden](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/) or [The Charlotte Hornets have a transgender mascot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/joovqq/the_charlotte_hornets_have_a_transgender_mascot/)     *Where would you currently rank the your team (must have flair) in a Powerrankings today?*      I would rank the Kings **17th**. Even though they don't have any superstars(or a competent coach), they are still sitting on a 2-2 record in the west with wins over the Suns and the Trailblazers . However, I also wouldn't put them in the top half of the rankings since they haven't made any significant additions besides Davion Mitchell this offseason and they finished a distant **23rd** last season(**12th** in the west)  *How often do you come on* r/nba*?*   I browse r/nba multiple times a day, from bathroom visits to bedtime reading I'm also on it for most of the day.      *How many games of your team do you watch on average per week during the season?

We absolutely love our players if they're decent people and at least okay at basketball. Shit Chemezie Metu has a huge fan base among Kings fans dude hasn't played yet this year lmao.   That being said Barnes is probably #1 right now with Davion Mitchell right on his heels.
"&gt;  Davion Mitchell  ""some"""
"Davion Mitchell, tired of hearing about ""Off Night,"" and dude is my favorite rookie"
"They're welcome to, I'm not criticizing them for doing so. I'm just noticing that they're doing it. r/nba is starting to view Davion Mitchell through the same eyes they viewed Tony Allen. They don't need to be defended because they're not being criticized.  I just find it interesting.  That's it.  There's nothing more to it."
That's how people talk about Tony Allen.  Basically Davion Mitchell is turning into Tony Allen in the minds of /r/nba
you want fun? watch Davion Mitchell...dude's fun to watch on defense.
The Tony Allen-ing of Davion Mitchell has already begun
"Duarte is an old prospect. He also looks like he has a strong chance to be the best 2 way rookie guard of the year, and is already *starting* for his team. Davion Mitchell is another example of an older player making immediate impact at 23.   Age is a confusing variable in NBA draft profiles, and it has always screamed [Simpson’s Paradox](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-simpsons-paradox-3126365) to me. I don’t have the time or data to actually plot 20yrs of draft success out to prove this, but I can definitively say that to prove my hypothesis or its null hypothesis, the data would have to be *stratified* to give you any truly defensible correlation result on whether age is a good independent predictor variable. My guess would be that it’s really not, and in game statistics generally serve as much better indicators for later success."
"meh. Looking at [this](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=FGA&amp;EndPeriod=0&amp;EndRange=28800&amp;GameID=0022100062&amp;PlayerID=101108&amp;RangeType=0&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;StartPeriod=0&amp;StartRange=0&amp;TeamID=1610612756&amp;flag=3&amp;sct=plot&amp;section=game), it looks like Davion Mitchell only guarded Chris Paul for 1 of his 10 FGA (missed). The other shots were guarded mostly by Fox and Haliburton"
Did Davion Mitchell guard Paul or Booker more?
"Agreed &amp; from what I've seen, Barnes &amp; Mobley are well ahead of the other rookies (except perhaps Davion Mitchell).  Scottie can guard 5 positions &amp; from end to end though, which could be the difference in voting."
Low key so could Davion Mitchell
"Phoenix did not call a timeout for their last possession, and I'm 99% sure it's because they didn't want Davion Mitchell to sub in. Kid makes an impact when he's not even in the game."
Excited to see davion Mitchell vs our backcourt today. I hope he gets a lot of time on book and CP3
davion mitchell disrespect
Dort and Davion Mitchell made it their personal agenda to not let Steph even shoot the ball. Stuck to him like white on rice. Terrence Mann also tried in the Clippers game but he isn't quite the defender those other two are
Had high hopes for Davion Mitchell but seeing he's only 6'1 means he's gonna be closest to the floor. Damn.
"No, you're thinking of Davion Mitchell, this is Donovan Mitchell."
"Virgin: “scoTTie bArneS”  Chad: Jalen Green, Houston Rockets.... Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers. ... Scottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors. ... Jalen Suggs, Orlando Magic. ... Josh Giddey, Oklahoma City Thunder. ... Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic. ... Davion Mitchell, Sacramento Kings. ... Ziaire Williams, Memphis Grizzlies."
"The couple of games I’ve watched of Davion Mitchell have been exciting. The dude flat out works, his offense needs some polish and more confidence, but his defense is nice."
"Davion Mitchell is a killer defender, so all his opponents have an “off night”"
"&gt;*This moreso LeBron than the Lakers tbh*  Yessss.  Players all have different motivations too. Giannis used to be very competitive vs. Cavs when Bron was there but he also liked dunking on the Knicks because they didn't come visit him to scout him in Greece like the other teams had haha.  Ja Morant likes battling against Russ, and that applies for whatever team he is on at the time.  Davion Mitchell really looked up to/studied Donovan Mitchell, so that matchup was going to be a little extra no matter what."
I really like Off Night. What a cool nickname for Davion Mitchell. He looks really good defensively.
Davion Mitchell and Giddey have been pretty good as well
"Calling Davion Mitchell ""sound"" defensively so far is like calling Manute Bol ""tall"" or Ben Simmons ""a bitch"""
"Fitz was great last night, he was even hyping up Davion Mitchell last night when he was going off. Of course he’ll have his homer moments, but I’d say he’s pretty good local commentator."
How tall is he now and how old is he. I literally only pay attention to the NBA. I watched like 12 college games last year and 3 were Baylor so I thought Davion Mitchell was gonna be a top 3 pick.
"First off, that announcer is trash for lack of respect for other people. the other team is your opponent, not inhuman. Always think if the roles were reversed, if your player got fouled like that how would you respond.     I am a Jazz fan and last week Joe Ingles got ejected for doing a much softer foul on Davion Mitchell, and it was justified because contact in the air is seriously dangerous. This should have been at minimum a Flagrant 1 because it could have resulted in greater injury for Giddey. Contact in the air is serious and ""superstars"" should not be exempt from it."
Davion Mitchell Tyrese Haliburton and De’Aaron Fox are bringing the kings back to the playoffs
Philly should jump at Davion Mitchell and Buddy Hield trade and call it a night.
Davion Mitchell playing more minutes than Haliburton and Buddy Hield only getting 25 mins (shooting 2-10!) bodes well for the hypothetical Ben Simmons trade
"Dort and Davion Mitchell are really messing with teams' best players, it's really fun to watch when it's not your team"
"Davion Mitchell is going to be a problem and I never understood why he dropped to 9th, he looked this damn good at Baylor"
Don't forget Davion Mitchell. I know not too many watch the Kings but he is a legit stud as well.
davion mitchell got that kyle lowry booty
Davion Mitchell.  That is all.
Davion Mitchell is nice.  Warrirors with steph might be a contender level team.  Without him they look like one of the worst teams in the league
Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton and okay? Shot's a little off but it just looks like it's still standard early-season Steph rust
Cheering for Davion Mitchell and Steph Curry to have good games
Davion Mitchell this you?
"https://theathletic.com/2908093/2021/10/23/davion-mitchell-and-the-kings-prep-for-the-steph-curry-test-and-a-warriors-team-that-discussed-drafting-him  someone else can post this for the karma.  it's an article by anthony slater and sam amick; the former is normally the warriors beatwriter but apparently the athletic got rid of their kings writer and maybe he's filling in a bit in the interim?  r/kings seemed to not like their old beatwriter anyway. orz  anyway, it's a nice piece about davion with specific video examples of various matchups.  also talks a bit about warriors pre-draft processes this year and how they regarded davion and some other prospects with complimentary quotes from kerr.  also mentions that davion got specific tips from luke walton for dealing with jordan clarkson and steph since he coached them before."
"Kawhi Leonard is 30, Simmons is already 25. Plus, Simmons is an objectively worse defender than Rudy Goebert, who’s 29. Simmons also averages less than 1 block per game at 6 foot 10.   He has quick hands and feet but doesn’t noticeably slow down great offensive players the  way Lu Dort, who’s 22 years old, Jrue Holiday, whose 31 years old, or even Davion Mitchell at 23 years old do."
"Mobley has a post up right now for his 17/9/6 and 17/11 games. Davion Mitchell has two posts about his defense against Lillaird, McCollum, Conley, Clarkson and Donovon Mitchell. Duarte has a post for his 27 point performance. Suggs got one for his 14/8/7 game. Other rookies are getting posts just like the Barnes ones and will continue to get them if they put up good games."
a team of Davion Mitchell - Marcus Smart - Dortz - Draymond - and Bam would be fun as hell and damn near impossible to score on
"&gt; On ball defenders don't really bother Curry  There are definitely a few defenders who bother Steph more than others. Especially ones that are smart, physical, and have the reputation with referees to get away with more contact (like Jrue Holiday). Though when he's on, even the best defenders feel helpless. Steph (and Warriors ball in general) also has a tendency to commit more turnovers with all the complicated ball/player movement (as well as Steph liking to get creative to enjoy the game, which ends up backfiring at times), which can be taken advantage of. I watched Dort guard Steph last season and Steph didn't seem to be bothered much, but the Thunder had a crap roster and were tanking. In any case, it'll be interesting to see how Dort handles guarding Steph this season, and obviously I'm excited to see what Davion Mitchell can do as a rookie."
"The offense might be iffy, but can you imagine being a guard trying score on that backcourt? You finally get the switch away from the Dorture Chamber, only to see Davion fucking Mitchell switching onto you."
"Chris Duarte is the next Klay, Davion Mitchell is the next Dort, Scottie Barnes is the next KD, Cade is injury prone, and Zion is an ice cream truck."
Davion Mitchell is a DPOY contender.
Davion Mitchell Tyrese Haliburton and De’Aaron Fox will bring the kings back to the playoffs
"""when defended by Davion Mitchell"""
He’s never met the goat perimeter defender Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell probably : Bring me Steph Curry !!
So when do we start the conversation of Davion Mitchell being possibly the first rookie to make first team all defense
Yo.. the battles of D Mitchell was fun. Davion is the real deal. Kings have absolutely slayed the last 2 late lottery picks.
Davion Mitchell is the real deal
I hear Davion Mitchell pees sitting down because he has clamps for hands.
Davion Mitchell is Off Night to everyone else.  To myself: He's the light we've needed for a long time in Sacramento.   Were the oldest team in the NBA and deserve a championship
People are gonna look at the box score and wonder why were raving about Davion Mitchell but man his on-ball defence was tremendous.
Davion Mitchell has got me SPOOKED.  Who IS this guy?
Davion Mitchell is going to give NBA players nightmares for years to come
Davion Mitchell is what Jazz fans expected Donovan Mitchell to be defensively.
Sad that we couldn't come out with a win but man Davion Mitchell is the real deal
Rudy Gobert remains underrated ... Monster   Also Davion Mitchell is an absolute mad man ... Sac really got back to back rooks who are fun as hell
Jazz are just better but the kings are on the up and up. Davion Mitchell is no joke.
Davion Mitchell is an absolute dog on defense.   Goodness.
"It's probably insane to say only 2 games into his career but is Davion Mitchell the best defensive guard in the league?  He's looked better guarding Donovan than Dort did the other night, I'm struggling to think of a guard who could shut Don down this well throughout an entire game.  He's single handedly going to make me watch the Kings play any team with an elite SG at this rate, I'm excited to watch him guard Harden."
"Fuck.  Oh well, at least Davion Mitchell clamped Donovan on two straight possessions."
Davion off night Mitchell
Davion Mitchell gonna fuck you up
That's what we tell them while the Davion Mitchell ROY campaign begins.
Its just one game. Let's expand the sample size and maybe we can get to a conclusion. When it comes to RJ Barrett its hard to evaluate coz he's so not flashy (unlike Giannis or Davion Mitchell) and that's ok.
Davion Mitchell got one bucket in 20 minutes?
As long as Davion Mitchell plays we will never lose a game. Undefeated baby
"...how was that disrespect to Davion?  Mitchell's one of my favorite players to watch cause his defense is awesome.  Portland set screens a lot when Mitchell was on Lillard or McCollum to get him into a mismatch with a big, so often times he just didn't end up 1v1, or was rotating etc.  Takes nothing away from him"
"People pretending that Davion Mitchell locked him up, but Dame was just missing shots he usually makes."
Davion Mitchell is gonna put the clamps on the poor souls who face him
it's typical when Davion Mitchell is on the floor
Davion “off night” Mitchell
"It wasn't because of Mitchell though. Dame was just throwing up bricks from outside, regardless of whether Davion was even guarding him."
Davion Mitchell? Because that's about all you'll get for Simmons. Maybe not even that.
Davion Mitchell already looks like one of the best perimeter defenders in the league
He was super cold all game.  Credit to Davion Mitchell for guarding him so well tho.
"horrible turnover by Haliburton, and horrible shot by Dame to end it. And also Luke Walton subbing in Davion Mitchell for Haliburton just because he made that mistake. If those guys aren't mature about that, it could cause a rift, especially because they're young guys essentially playing the same position.   Weird win, but I guess a win is a win for them."
Davion Mitchell unbeaten streak continues today
I don’t know how extremely wrong you are with almost every one.  Defender is Davion Mitchell. He’s a plus defender day one.  Passer could be Suggs or Barnes  Shooter is definitely not Mitchell. Most likely Trey Murphy
"I have been a sorry Kings fan for over 25 years and follow them closely (That Webber era was sweet though).  Bagley and his dad have been bitching about how he has been treated since he was drafted, so what you read before the season is nothing new. I have been rooting for him to do well, but the kid just doesn't get it. He has low BBIQ and no fire. He thinks he is a great player, and expects that kind of treatment from the Kings. No Bagley, starting isn't a right.  The front office fielded multiple offers last year when they saw writing on the wall and they all sucked, including reasonable 1st round picks. There is no value period. He just hasn't played enough games. They were also hoping that he gets his head out of his ass and worked on his game come the training camp, but he just doesn't have the fire (compare him to Davion Mitchell and it's night and day).  I assure you he will be gone this year."
"|***MVP***|KD| |:-|:-| |***DPOY***|AD| |***ROY***|Cade Cunningham| |***6MOY***|IQ| |***MIP***|Terance Mann| |***COY***|Finch from the TWolves|  RATIONALE: KD will play like he actually cares in the regular season and if he does I think he walks away with MVP EZ, especially if Kyrie misses a lot of time.  AD is the centerpiece of what I think will be the Association's best defense.   Cade will post the best counting stats among rookies. He won't be as efficient as Davion Mitchell but he'll still get ROY.  IQ is in a great situation and I think Rose and Ingles will miss time while Clarkson will be way too inefficient to win it again. I also don't have the Jazz as a top 4 seed.  Mann should get a lot of usage and I think get like 19 ppg.  Timberwolves gonna have home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs out west. Finch ain't the reason but he'll get some credit for it."
De’Aaron Fox Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell are bringing the kings back to the playoffs
Davion Mitchell instilling some pride on the defensive end and not being dead last in the league.
"Blowout trade idea of the day. Just made impossible due to Brogdon's extension but I want to get thoughts on it anyway:   **Sixers receive:**   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  **Warriors receive:**  * Domantas Sabonis  * Buddy Hield  **Pacers receive:**  * James Wiseman  * Davion Mitchell  * Marvin Bagley  * Seth Curry  * Kings 1st  **Kings receive:**  * Ben Simmons  * Furkan Korkmaz  Sixers starting 5: Malcolm Brogdon/Danny Green/Andrew Wiggins/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid  Warriors starting 5 (by playoffs): Steph Curry/Jordan Poole/Klay Thompson/Draymond Green/Domantas Sabonis  Pacers starting 5: Seth Curry/Caris Levert/TJ Warren/Marvin Bagley/Myles Turner  Kings starting 5: De'Aaron Fox/Tyrese Haliburton/Harrison Barnes/Ben Simmons/Richaun Holmes  Sixers flip Ben Simmons and Seth Curry into Malcolm Brogdon and Andrew Wiggins, fixing their roster construction. They're a better playoff team than before.   Warriors turn Wiggins and Wiseman into all-star Sabonis and flamethrower Buddy Hield. We'd have Steph/Poole/Hield as guards, Klay/Otto/Kuminga/Moody/Iguodala/Juan as wings, Dray/Bjelica/Looney as our bigs. That's solid top to bottom.   Kings flip two of their excess guards and a failed prospect plus a pick for Ben Simmons and a bench guard, it's a no brainer for them. Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Simmons/Holmes is the best lineup they would have put out in a long time  Who says no?"
"This draft class looks like it's going to have a lot of great players, so I think the teams are going to primarily be based on who gets more minutes/opportunity:  1st Team: Cade, Green, Giddey, Barnes, Sengun  \- Cade and Green will get the green light from Day 1. It's hard to imagine either of them not putting up good numbers.  \- Giddey looks great on the ball and should be initiating a lot of offense. I think he'll get a lot of minutes on a bad Thunder team and his playmaking will make him stand out.  \- Sengun looks great for the Rockets and he's already our 2nd best big. He's super polished and it's only a matter of time before he starts and is getting 30+ minutes, and I think he'll put up great numbers to go with that.  \- Barnes may not get the minutes and opportunity of the other guys here but I think he'll play a large role in a Raptors team that outperforms expectations. I think that'll get him a 1st team nod.  2nd Team: Suggs, Davion Mitchell, Duarte, Trey Murphy, Mobley  \- Suggs and Davion mainly make it for defense while showing good offensive flashes.  \- Duarte and Murphy are pretty polished for rookies and will be great role players for their respective teams.  \- Mobley is an amazing prospect, but I have a hard time seeing him thrive on offense next to Jarret Allen in his rookie year. Sexland will also be the focus for that team on offense, so I think he barely misses out on 1st team due to a reduced role compared to the other 1st team guys."
"Kings-Fox is heatseeking borderline all-star missile, Haliburton will be starting and will be tossing jump passes like crazy, 3 guard lineup with Davion Mitchell, two microwave scorers (Hield and Davis) off the bench, Bagley's second jump, and a roster with zero real small forwards."
"Poole, Keldon Johnson, Davion Mitchell, Poku, hell even Hartenstein I'd put over THT lol"
Jaren is still younger than some guys picked in the latest draft. He's almost exactly a year younger than Davion Mitchell for instance.
Lakers look mediocre overall and finish as a 5 or 6 seed.  Davion Mitchell doesn't live up to the hype  Timberwolves look surprisingly good until an injury to one of their big three slows the team down. They finish as a play in team.
1st team - Cade/Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Davion Mitchell/Mobley
Very young players only  Davion Mitchell Lu Dort Cam Reddish Scottie Barnes Evan Mobley
Tristan Thompson is the vet currently. Definitely making his presence felt. Also I know it sound crazy but Davion Mitchell spending that extra time in college and his work ethic is vet like. He shifted the culture.
"Acting like Davion Mitchell is just some dude is hilarious. We replaced half our coaching staff and snagged TT, who seems to be pushing our young guys."
I'm here for Davion Mitchell
Yeah they’d both be good on the warriors for different reasons  Also I don’t know if you are joking or not but Mikal and Miles aren’t actually related. Kinda like davion and Donovan Mitchell aren’t related either

Not even close. I’m saying Davion Mitchell isn’t on the same tier as Jrue Holiday or Ben Simmons. My comment wasn’t referring to Steph at all.
Giddey has been impressive and Davion Mitchell has been disappointing imo
Shouldn't this be Davion Mitchell time?
"Davion Mitchell is an elite defender, both on-ball and help defense"
Davion mitchell  Gary trent jr dillon brooks draymond green clint capela
"Cade’s not “unathletic by NBA standards.” He’s not an uber athlete like the Zach Lavine’s of the world but that dont mean he can’t get to any spot he wants to on the floor, as he’s super crafty w elite deceleration, hes an average NBA athlete but super skilled. He’s able to “slow by you” - slowing down &amp; then changing direction suddenly or stopping on a dime. Then he’s got hesi’s, eye fakes, twitches, crossovers, spins, that tween tween step back - he’s a tough tough cover that bag is deep  The fact he’s already been able to get the ball on the perimeter and then reach into his bag to score by OG, Thybulle, Davion Mitchell and on Turner, Embiid, Giannis shows me that this kid’s the truth."
this is getting ridiculous.  &amp;#x200B;  Everyone's interested in Simmons. No one wants to trade anyone substantial.  &amp;#x200B;  what is the point in these articles? Who else do the Kings have of note? Hield? Davion Mitchell? Bagley?
"no, we'd have absolutely no shooting left beyond buddy's unpredictable heat streaks. if fox or davion mitchell were better shooters then absolutely yes"
"Shout out to Davion Mitchell (aka Off Night) coming in at -6.4 differential despite guarding the opponent’s #1 or #2 scorer much of the time. He’s defended Steph, Dame, Book, and Donovan Mitchel to name a few."
"Agree 100% but also am I the only one who thinks bringing Simmons to a team with Fox, Haliburton also doesn't make sense? If they don't include Davion Mitchell then WTF are the Kings thinking? Simmons playing off ball just doesn't make sense."
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"I agree with that, in comparison to Davion Mitchell he’s much more comfortable in the NBA, much less raw. I guess I’m comparing Ant in this moment to what I think Ant will be at 28. And to me the gap there could be enormous. Like I really believe he has the ceiling of a generational talent. And I don’t throw generational around lightly. Steph, Magic, Bird, Lebron, Jordan, KD, Giannis, to me those are generational talents and I can see Ant getting there. I don’t see Davion Mitchell that way. I see him as a top 100 NBA role player at his ceiling."
"I see what you’re saying, but I honestly don’t think it’s fair to call him incredibly raw. He’s still somewhat raw for sure, but I don’t know about incredibly raw. Davion Mitchell is incredibly raw. Ant is already putting people on posters and dropping almost 50 on people."
That lineup down the stretch... What the hell  PG: Davion Mitchell  SG: Buddy Hield  SF: Tyrese Haliburton  PF: Maurice Harkless  C: Damian Jones  &amp;#x200B;  The Alvin Gentry experience is changing things up
"Ok so let’s just pretend that luka demands a trade after losing in the first round of the playoffs again, since that’s hypothetically the only way the Mavericks would listen to offers. You’d have to look for something like the Harden package but way, way better, because 1) the Harden trade sucked for the rockets and 2) Luka is only 22. So the most competitive offers would probably look like:  Boston offering Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Aaron Nesmith, and Marcus Smart (maybe? idk how the contracts would work) and all their picks  Pelicans offer Ingram, Alexander-Walker, Herb Jones and picks  Sixers offer Simmons, Maxey, Danny Green, Korkmaz and picks  Timberwolves send a paltry offer of Malik Beasley, D-Lo, McDaniels, Nowell and all their picks  Kings send a slightly less insulting offer of Fox, Bagley, and Davion Mitchell along with all of their picks  Maybe the Pacers get involved with Brogdon and Duarte?  Thunder could be in the mix with their millions of picks, although there’s no way Luka would demand a trade just to get sent to OKC lol.   Off the top of my head those are the only teams that could/would throw together some big trade package if Luka wants out.   Plus, when it comes to picks, you’d be looking at ~8 firsts (4 unprotected firsts, 4 pick swaps)  Obviously none of these trades match his value, but when your star player publicly demands a trade you begin to lose leverage and have to start looking for the best deal available.   Pelicans and Thunder have the best draft assets of the teams listed, Sixers and Celtics have the best talent offered. I’d be most inclined to take the either the Sixers or Pelicans deal, but I’d still try to squeeze every last asset I could get out of them."
I'd rather have Jordan Poole than Davion Mitchell going forward.  Also I find it funny that Chris Duarte is a rookie and is ineligible for this list.
Davion Mitchell and THT on here?  This list is so trash lol  Jarrett Allen and Herro over Fox and SGA????
"Uh I guess like most teams, when we’re playing well we’re fun to watch. Buddy can be Steph-lite with some shots, but that’s pretty rare and usually you have to watch 10-15 bricks before you get there. Fox still turns on the jets and does slick drives to the rim, but only some times. Holmes is a good energy guy and gets hyped, and his p&amp;r with Tyrese is fun to watch. Tyrese also gets in the passing lanes a lot which can lead to some fun transition offense. Davion Mitchell is a beast at on-ball defense, I don’t know that anybody can move laterally as quickly and as strongly as he can.  Lots of flaws with our roster and the way guys are working together but our first 10 or so games were pretty fun to watch. At some point it just seems like all the fire’s gone out, and you only see glimmers of what used to be. Idk if Gentry will get the team back on track, but if he does we’ll definitely be trending upward"
Davion Mitchell is closer to Frank Ntilikina than Matisse Thybulle
"Shh you're gonna trigger all the salty Kings fans. They're delusional, one of them even said Davion Mitchell is already as good a defender as Thybulle"
"Here's something I wrote for a different Kings post (after the Luke Walton firing).  ---------  As far as roster goes, I think everyone's movable at the right price. However, the biggest issue is the lack of decent players at every non-PG position. Peep their depth chart.  PG: Fox | Davion Mitchell | Jah'mius Ramsey  SG: Haliburton (also PG) | Terence Davis | Robert Woodard II  SF: Barnes | Hield | Mo Harkless  PF: Metu | Bagley  C: Holmes | Len | TT | Damian Jones  Let's get the first issue out of the way. Their roster stinks. They have maybe 5 rotation-level players (Fox/Haliburton/Barnes/Holmes/Hield). But then what?  Davion Mitchell is an all-D, no-O rookie for now. Terence Davis has some scoring ability, but is rightfully stuck behind three decent guards and D Mitchell.  Mo Harkless has been a body at his recent stops. They've started Mo Harkless in 11 games. They started Chimezie Metu recently. Not saying either is bad bad, but would either even be getting playing time on most teams?  Alex Len has been hanging on in the league by a thread for a few years now and wouldn't be able to play onto most contenders' rosters. TT is washed (partially because of the direction the NBA took) and is a walking trade chip at this point.  Ramsey and Woodard would be two-ways at best on most teams. I don't think Damian Jones has ever been good, even when he was on the Warriors. And Bagley hardly plays.  You look at other mediocre rosters and they all either are clearly developmental (Rockets, Thunder) or they have at least 8-10 NBA level players on the roster, if not more.  The Warriors, Phoenix, Utah, Wizards, Nets, Bulls, Heat, Cavs, Bucks, 76ers, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Grizzlies, and Knicks all have a decent list of players who they can play who aren't complete liabilities (that's half the league, at least). Even for the 4-11 Spurs, you can point to 8 guys who should be on a contender's 10 man rotation (depending on positional excess). The Kings pretty much only have five rotation-quality players, and no amount of coaching will salvage that.  -----------  Their roster is talent-dry AND they don't enough have any assets worth a damn. They have +2 second rounders in total. That's it."
Davion blew me away like Donovan Mitchell in his first few games. Davion doesn’t have the same flashiness to his game but man he is one of the most solid NBA ready prospects I’ve seen in a while. Very poised and he has the genetic gifts and skill to be a fixture in the league.
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
Davion Mitchell  Ceiling: Kyle Lowry  Floor: Tony Allen
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
Davion Mitchell
"27th pick of this summer’s draft. Pure scorer who needs to add a lot more to his game. But the scoring is definitely NBA ready and with the Nets banged up, he got real minutes last night.   I believe he led all freshmen in scoring last season when he was at LSU. Also Oak Hill’s all time leading scorer. Summer League co-mvp with Davion Mitchell."
I’ll probably restart the hate but the way they gassed up Davion Mitchell in preseason and early season made me dislike him. These dudes were acting like they had the reincarnation of Ron Artest and Bruce Bowen combined.
"imagine being the kings and thinking richaun holmes, davion mitchell and tyrese haliburton are untouchable  LMFAO"
It took me two seconds to google this: https://www.sportscasting.com/davion-mitchell-off-night-already-locked-up-stephen-curry-damian-lillard-donovan-mitchell-first-week-pro/ - but I also watched him enough to see both his on ball and off ball defense.
I feel bad for Davion Mitchell.  Goes from championship winning Baylor to shitty Sacramento
but…DAVION MITCHELL???
kings fans downvoted me when i said davion mitchell isn’t a centerpiece for simmons.
halliburton and davion mitchell are both two way players while fox is kinda bad defensively
"Davion Mitchell TS% now down to 43.7% on the season.   ""Off night,"" indeed."
"Davion Mitchell has all-defensive potential, I wouldn’t say they made a bad move  Also Hali is more of a combo guard"
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Franz Wagner  4. Cade Cunningham   5. Chris Duarte   6. Josh Giddey  7. Davion Mitchell   8. Herb Jones  9. Alperen Sengun   10a. Jalen Suggs  10b. Jalen Green  12. Austin Reeves  13. Ayo Dosunmo  14. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl  15. Dalano Banton  16. Bones Hyland
"&gt; But the lakers signed him knowing he wasn't a good 3pt shooter (at the time at least,) and they don't need another ball handler.  They didn't sign him from a pool of possible options. They kept him because they couldn't replace the salary slot if they let him go, and because they believe in his longer-term ceiling being much higher than Caruso's. Now, they didn't keep both for financial reasons...which might have been dumb. But THT hasn't even turned 21 yet.   He's younger than Bouknight, 3 years younger than Davion Mitchell, 4 years younger than Duarte. He's only a few months older than Suggs, Scottie Barnes, and Evan Mobley."
Davion Mitchell. The 6 foot tall davion Mitchell. He is not a “unicorn” whatsoever
It’s the same with Bol Bol and Davion Mitchell… Poku fits the mold of “unicorn” and that attracts attention.   Mitchell gets a ton of posts like Giddey bc they’re rookies and new and shiny.   Garza gets attention because he won National Player of the Year in college. He was literally a superstar at Iowa so he has a huge fan base. You’re ignoring context.
He's not criticizing the Haliburton pick. He's a huge fan of his. He's criticizing the fact that they picked three point guards. Davion Mitchell is the third point guard. He's not roasting the Kings for picking De'Aaron Fox either.
&gt;Choosing BPA is a good thing  Pretty sure Davion Mitchell was not the BPA at No. 9.
"they should tho, because Ben/Fox &amp; Davion Mitchell is an amazing trio to build around - Philly can get a solid PG in Tryrese, a proven 3 point threat to further surround Embiid with shooters in Buddy, and a project in Bagley       u/dmorey plz respond"
"Also we already changed our general manager, whose first two picks have been Tyrese Haliburton (an obvious BPA who’s looking like a great offensive player) and Davion Mitchell (a player questioned at first but whose defense has been able to give Damian Lillard an opening night where he missed every three pointer he took)"
Davion*  Donovan Mitchell would be an amazing pick for the Kings lmfao
Classic kings to not draft luka because of fit and then to take Halliburton and davion Mitchell back to back.   I think they are obviously plotting on a fox trade.
Look at that big glowy purple box with Davion mitchell on it. The fan is sitting to (our) right of the box
Davion Mitchell
"They got Davion Mitchell and Ty Halliburton and will get Simmons in return, they should move on Fox and dump the contract of Barnes or Hield in the exchange."

He's a year younger than Davion Mitchell - lots of room for him to grow
"Same size as Davion Mitchell - who's considered a good defender. He leads the league in deflection year after year, it isn't blasphemous to have him on this list."
That’s not true. I’m very excited about Davion Mitchell
"And a soft rebuild makes it even less reasonable to trade Simmons for middling role players, unless they expect the cap to expand 50-60M and the Simmons max off the books means actual cap space.   They get no cap relief and getting meh role players doesn't help a retooling. It does put guys like Garland, Davion Mitchell and Hayes in their radar, all of the above could try to make a crazy power move and would give Philly a young point to retool around. Other than that, however, it's all the same: a trade for a trade only gives them more unwanted players and no cap relief."
"You’re talking about Davion Mitchell, right? Cuz if the Jazz even entertain the thought of a swap of Don for Ben fucking Simmons I will kill myself"
Do you even know what the ejections were or are you just looking for reasons to take shots at the Jazz?  Ingles second ejection was justified but it was him coming in contact with a ref. Donovan's was the same. Both were deemed unintentional contact.  Whiteside was ejected for fighting with JaMychal Green.  Ingles' first ejection was due to a flagrant 2 because he made incidental contact with Davion Mitchell while he was in the air. He was trying to get out of the way.
"Yea your last point I think has a lot to do with Casey’s offensive system, where he discourages the PnR at all costs and he discourages giving the ball to Cade down low in the post.   In college, Cade averaged something like 25/8/7 against Davion Mitchell - and that’s cause the coach actually knew how to use him. His handle isn’t the tightest so if you have him go 1 v 1 vs short, strong, good defenders they’ll be able to pick him. At OSU they instead gave him a ton of screens (Pistons don’t do that) and they swung the ball to the other PG &amp; made him feed Cade in the post to use the mismatch on the small PG (Pistons dont do that either).  So I definitely know your point - and I also think it’s a very fixable issue, but sadly it will require Dwane Casey to think. So itll never happen."
Both games against Davion “Off Night” Mitchell and the Kings
"Just have to be careful with that one - it was against the Kings. The Kings defense improved a bit from last year, but it was one of the worst defenses in NBA history last year so it's hard not to go up. They're still not great. He was also getting switched onto by our guys at the 4 &amp; 5 all night, and otherwise being primarily defended not by Davion Mitchell, but by Tyrese Haliburton who's one of our worst on-ball defenders, or by Fox who has a proclivity to let guys do whatever they want on screens.  That said, he looked really damn good. He was cooking from 3, no matter how much our announcers wanted to speak bad shooting into existence by mentioning his poor career numbers. He made some great passes and drives against big &amp; small alike. He got some hops and good timing for boards.  The biggest issue I saw for him was actually when he had a small, quick defender up in his grill in iso. Fox picked him twice and Mitchell once I think, and generally any time he couldn't get a screen with Fox or Mitchell guarding him he just had to give it up to a teammate. Which is kinda surprising, but those dudes are pretty damn strong for their size."
"Davion Mitchell is the prototype for successful guards in the coming years: short, strong, athletic.   Watch him start plucking steals from all the point-forwards &amp; point-centers of the league thanks to their below-average handles"
"Mitchell can arguably guard the quickest guards a little better than Kuminga, but Kuminga has the size/strength to guard a majority of the league better than 6'0 Davion"
"Are you getting hate responses in DM or something? Lol nobody even responded aggressively or anything  To answer though yeah we have more talent this year than we have in a while, probably since we have cousins/gay/rondo  Fox (bad season so far), flamethrowa Buddy hield, advanced stat darling Richaun Holmes, smooth and steady Harrison Barnes, future inside the nba member Tyrese Haliburton, thicc boi Davion Mitchell, and seen flashes of talent from bench pieces like Terence Davis or Len  Nothing that’s gonna blow you away or anything but a couple potential All-stars on there, and some depth. Not on the Hawks level yeah but definitely better than the pelicans or the thunder"
Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
"Davion Mitchell is looking very solid for the Kings. Hard to say what his ceiling is at this point, but he's already a contributor."

"Yeah I remember him cooking Davion Mitchell I think when Mitchell was really going at him. He was like ""damn bro fucking lay off me"" and then was like ok you won't like me when I'm angry mode"
"Davion Mitchell is better than some of those guys, for sure."
Are you serious? Thybulle? Ben Simmons? Plenty of amazing 1 on 1 defenders. Even Davion Mitchell already looks special.
"He'll always be exploitable due to his frame but someone claimed that during the 2018 WCF, the Rockets had a lower offensive rating when they tried to attack Curry.   Now he is capable of playing stellar defense for a point guard. Its not Jrue Holiday or Davion Mitchell or even CP3 levels but he clearly gives effort. Stark contrast to other offensive juggernaut guards.  If you watched that game against the Hawks, he dogged that team on defense for some reason."
"I don't think aibwykat's comment was a straw man, though it may have been unclear.  Are the Kings' parts truly even a good product? Up until the last couple of drafts, they were really only riding on Fox, Harrison Barnes, and Buddy. They've had Richaun Holmes, Bjelica, and Bogdan Bogdanovic. They finally hit with Tyrese Haliburton and now Davion Mitchell. But tell me how a roster with those players as the core is supposed to keep up with the other Western juggernauts. Their incredibly lackluster drafting for more than a decade now (with pretty much only Fox and Cousins as hits) and their mishandling of draft assets (see the Stauskas trade) are out of Walton's hands. The best coaches in the NBA may have dragged these rosters to a low playoff seed a few times but they've been devoid of talent for a while.  That said, I agree that Luke should have been fired long ago."
"Right after that, Cade plays the #9 pick Davion Mitchell, #13 pick Chris Duarte, and #7 + #14 picks Kuminga and Moody.   He’s playing 6 lottery picks in a row!"
"Should Cade, who's played 3 1/2 games (the first 2 he went 3/22), be above Davion Mitchell?"
"But the post is about Philly demanding Jaylen Brown. That's a significant difference in value compared to Barnes, Davion and a 1st - even including how amazing Barnes has been to start the season.  Plus I'm not sure Philly has full use for Mitchell, as they already have a great perimeter defender with offensive limitations.  Philly taking that offer would be a reduction in their ask. I think the discussion is about which GMs would be willing to meet the current price (ie, a 25yo All Star), rather than a possible future discounted price."

Evan Mobley: 13.8/7.9/2.3/1/1.3 on 49.1/15.4/78.8 shooting.  Scottie Barnes: 17.6/8.9/2.3 on 52.1/22.2/70.8 shooting.  Chris Duarte: 16.1/4.4/2.4/1 on 44.3/42.4/92.3 shooting.  Jalen Green (oof he has bad shooting splits but he's not out of the ROTY picture):  14.1/3.4/3.1 on 35.5/29.7/73.3 shooting.  Jalen Suggs (same comment as for Green): 12.6/3.3/3.4 on 31/22.8/84.6 shooting.  Franz Wagner: 14.5/3.5/1.9/1.1 on 47.5/39.6/66.7.  Guys like Giddey and Davion Mitchell are both averaging around 10 ppg and can creep into the contenders as the season goes on as well.
"Simmons, Thybulle, Dort, Butler, (Davion) Mitchell, Jrue, (Mikael) Bridges, Kawhi, PG, Smart.  I might be missing a few, but now that I think about it, Wiggins could be as good or better than those I forgot. And maybe a couple of those I listed.  Edit: I take that back, everyone I listed is better. But top 15 is good enough, right?"
&gt;Davion Mitchell  He's averaging 10ppg. Where did you get 16+?
Honestly Davion Mitchell might be up here
"Barnes isnt top 5 even. Gimme Mobley, Wagner, Giddey, Duarte and Davion Mitchell over him"
"Davion Mitchell deserves to be top 3. He’s putting up 16+ off the bench each night and probably the best on ball defender in the league. Josh Giddey isn’t even close to Mitchell, like at all"
"They're not in your shortlist, but an open invitation to get on the Kings train. 5-4, a win over the Suns and Lakers, three of their losses were the Jazz (twice) and the Warriors. Davion Mitchell is the best guard defender in the class and finding his offensive game, they got high level guardplay, Richaun Holmes is one of the coolest people in the NBA and Marvin Bagley isn't stinking up the court."
Oh and he's 22.  He's a year younger than Davion Mitchell.
He was crossing up Davion Mitchell 40ft from the basket and finishing multiple defenders a week ago. Also went to the rim every single time against mismatches like Kennard and Morris in the Clippers game. Marcus Thompson said he talked to Curry after the Hornets game and was surprised played because he sounded very sick.
Davion Mitchell and my Baylor Bears ruining Gonzaga perfect record to cap off the national champ 😎
"Davion Mitchell got drafted by us when we already have 4 solid guards, Fox, Tyrese, Buddy, Terence Davis  Which sounds bad, although at the time I know we were looking at trading Buddy so then he would’ve just been under Fox and Hali  The minutes split is still a little problematic, there’s only 96 minutes to be had at the 1 &amp; 2 spot and now we gotta split it between 4 dudes (TD is out of the rotation atm). But Buddy plays at the 3 sometimes, we’ve even put in 4 guard lineups at certain points.  Aside from the guard logjam, Davion has been awesome for us. It’s actually not a bad situation at all. He gets to step in right away and play big minutes, even closing games for us. We were terrible on defense last season, and definitely a little soft last year- both things that Davion excels at. The guy is a great defender but the hard work and grit he gives us has gone a long way.  If you just look at box score numbers, he’s not gonna jump out at you. His shooting hasn’t been great. But he has great vision, plays under control, and that DEFENSE especially on ball is awesome. Dort/Smart/Holiday/Thybulle/rookie DAVION all come to mind this year when you think of defensive stoppers (shouts out to GTJ too)  People talk about a culture shift all the time with our team, this is the first year it actually seems real, and Off Night’s a big part of that. It probably wasn’t his ideal situation to come into (Davion on the warriors would’ve been amazing) but he’s the type of guy who’s gonna make the best out of any situation, and he’s doing it with us. Love this guy man"
"&gt; No, man. You just brush off all of the issues Jamal had as a player. He couldn't string together 3 games of solid play, idgaf who was scouting him or what he was doing behind the scenes. His inconsistency went way beyond the domain of just being a young player.  It was not beyond the domain or just being a young player. Since box scores are the only thing that is connecting with you then here:  In his 2nd year and 1st as a starter, the 20 year old Jamal Murray had 27 games of 20 or more, including 7 over 30 5 of those over 58%, 3 over 60%, 2 over 70%. Of all the games he had under 10 points the majority of them were in wins. He had more games over 16 points than under 16 point.  In his 3rd year he had 29 games of over 20 or more, including 7 over 30 and 2 over 40 (48 and 46) which were both over 60% from the floor and misses 7 1/2 games to injury. OBPM goes up, BPM goes up just like it did the year before. TRB% goes up, AST% goes up, TOV% goes down while USG% goes up.  As a 21 year old, and I cannot stress this enough a 21 year old in his first playoffs he averages 21/4/5/1. Massively weight down by one very poor game. He has more games over 23 points than under and has two 34 point games to boot. Is also a + in two of the Nuggets losses and has the highest TS% among all non-bigs on the Nuggets, and a higher TS% than CJ and Dame.  His efficiency scoring went down in the regular season a bit but he was also given much more responsibility and allowed to take more shots. Generally speaking the efficiency goes down when that happens until a player is able to get used to it. If they are able to. Obviously they felt strongly that he would.  He did this on a playoff team that was winning games. A successful team. One where he wasn't the main option every night or could decide his fate all the time. That means it wasn't the situation where a player is putting up empty stats on a bad team (Sexton) and on paper looks much better than they are. Inconsistency aside he was playing winning basketball, had winning effort, and on top of that had made it clear that if he has a bad game in the first 3 quarters he comes out in the 4th ready to kill. He proved this many, many times.  That is a 100% of the time maxed player by the team they are playing for. A super young guy who can struggle for an entire game but then tap in and become a closer in the 4th, and seeks that, is significantly more intriguing and interesting for teams than someone who comes out and gives you 14-18 a night reliably in the system--i.e. Mikal Bridges. There is no question that Jamal had consistency issues, he would go for 20+ 4 games in a row and then come out with a 14 pointer and a 15 pointer the next two. But what he wasn't was mentally inconsistent. He was checked in and wanted the moments, even if he was missing shots. This wasn't a situation where he was fading away or getting in his head and avoiding the  responsibility. That is massive and overweighs a 15-25 point rollercoaster ride given his age.  Before he turned 22 years old Murray had shown improvement every single year. Clear, visual, in game, improvement. Added and refined skills. Was becoming extremely good in the PnR with Jokic, so much so that even at that age with this up and coming team he and Jokic LEAD THE LEAGUE IN ASSISTS BETWEEN TWO TEAMMATES and were considered a deadly late game system by themselves. He showed it in the regular season and showed it as the #2 guy in his first playoffs, again, as a 21 year old.   Sexton is 23 years old right now, has been putting up empty stats on a perennially bad team as -the- guy with the system built to help him succeed, and taking pretty much as many shots as he wants. Shoot Murray even if his scoring was off could turn into the offensive facilitator and would actively go for rebounds. He more than doubles Sexton in each category by the time he turned 21. He also proved he knew how to play off ball as a cutter or shooter, and was very good at keeping the ball secure and not having turnovers or getting into situations that could force a turnover. These are extremely valuable things that aren't going to show up on the box score. That is extremely uncommon maturity and poise for a 21 year old.  His weaknesses were inconsistency with scoring (as a 19, 20, 21 year old on a competitive team I will provide you with countless examples of inconsistency at that age including players like Carmelo and LeBron) and defense. Unless you come into the league as a defensive player, and a very good one like Davion Mitchell or GP2, NBA defense takes a while to get used to and learn. Not just whatever scheme you're playing as a team that you have likely never played in, but the size and speed of grown ass men with years of NBA training and the significantly heightened skill level of scorers. People doing things you've never had to guard before. Every young player gets slack on learning defense when they come in, because 99% of them need 2-3+ years to become a tolerable defender for a playoff caliber team. If not more.   Seriously. You have a 21 year old who has proven to you he can string together 20 point games since he was 19. He can have back to back 30 point game sin the playoffs. He has a fantastic mechanics/footwork for someone his age, and a shot form that will translate to better and better shooting as he himself gets better. He's already adept at being the main ball handler, an extraordinarily good PnR guard who can score from all 3 levels out of it (there are some all-stars who struggle with this in their late 20s!), can confidently play off ball as a spot up shooter or slasher and make the right offensive reads to facilitate success (being a good look), who is an extremely hard worker, improves his level of play in bigger or higher leverage situations, and does not shy away from it.   All of that is far, far, far, far greater than the negatives of inconsistent shooting and poor defense. Those are the reasons that Tim Connelly and Coach Malone never once considered trading him, said he was off limits since year 2, believed in him and gave him more and more responsibility despite having a budding superstar in Jokic who could be option 1 and 2, constantly and publicly praised him while also treating him with the responsibility level of a vet after year 2, and signed him to that max extension.   As any single team with a brain would have done. It is an absolute no doubt decision for all 30 teams. He is a special player and it was clear to see what was in there half way through year 2.   &gt; Was the Sixers front office full of donkeys when they gave Simmons the max?  By the time Philly signed Ben Simmons to his max he had been the Rookie of the Year, an All-Star twice, All-NBA 3rd team, All-Defensive 1st team, lead the league in steals, was a pivotal member of a team 1 game away from the finals, and was cruising to 16/8/8/2 a night on high 50s from the floor. He had all the tools and wherewithal to be an incredible slashing threat too if Philly had a better passer. There is no team at any point in the history of basketball who wouldn't have maxed him. His issue is entirely mental, and sad, and there was no predicting that.  &gt;  Was the Knicks front office full of redditors when they gave Porzingis the max?  Are we talking about the Kristaps who put up 23/7 with 2.5 blocks a night while being 7'3"" and shooting 40% from 3 and made the All-Star game? The guy who had made a massive jump each year in the league and was playing incredible before completely blowing apart his leg? If you're asking me if it was unwise for a team to max a 22 year old 7'3"" unicorn who could fly for huge dunks, shoot 3s better than many guards, and protect the paint and rim at an elite level I'd ask if you're joking. That's a no brainer. Now the issue if there was one is that it is a direct gamble to give a contract to any big man coming off an injury like that. Especially one as athleticism reliant as Porzingis. Regardless all 30 teams if they are in that position are giving him the max, you have to assume he comes back near that and if that's as good as he gets  for his career he's a better Brook Lopez and gets maxed into his 30s.  &gt; They were better players than Jamal as well.  Which is why they were no doubt decisions. Zero doubt. Zero hesitation. Zero questioning of the decision from those teams. Then both of those contracts presently look iffy because of completely uncontrollable circumstances. You can't guess if a player explodes his leg, and you can't guess if a player runs into one of the worst mental blocks in the history of the sport out of nowhere. That has zero to do with the front office's decision making.  &gt;  For every player who pans out and ends up being worth it there's a player that ends up overpaid.   Here are the players on a rookie max currently: Ben Simmons, SGA, Trae, MPJ, Fox, Mitchell, Bam, Tatum, KAT, Booker, Murray, Wiggins, Embiid, Siakam. The only questionable signing in this whole bunch is Siakam. When Wiggins was maxed that was as much Minnesota not being able to afford any semblance of a good player leaving them. Otherwise which of these players do you think isn't gonna be worth the contract? You implied 50% of them and considering all of them except for 8 games of MPJ and Siakam have been worth it, who is going to have a massive regression out of nowhere?  &gt;  Waiting a year doesn't cost them, simply.   Yes it does. This isn't 2K. The human element plays a massive part in this. Waiting a year tells a player ""eh, we dunno if we believe in you yet. let's see another year"", while all of their peers in the same situation are getting maxed. It also opens up really dumb FA possibilities which teams do not want to deal with even removing the fact they are burning part of the bridge with what could be a cornerstone player + their team."
"Davion Mitchell is also fantastic in Sacramento. He's an undersized point guard, but is still a ferocious defender. Fun to watch"
"He’s not a box score type player but more a pesky, active on ball defender. That’s his biggest strength and how he helps out the team the most. He was def the second most impactful player in the playoff series against us outside of Ja with his active hands giving us fits, similar to the praise Davion Mitchell has been getting this year.  He 100 percent makes the Grizz better"

Davion Mitchell @me of you want
DAVION MITCHELL
"Davion Mitchell is playing awesome defense. Donovan had to work for every bucket he got when Davion was guarding him, and most of his scores came off plays designed to get a different defender switched onto him."
I think Davion mitchell is a stud. The 3 pointer needs a lot of work but he’s already a hell of a defender
"Obligatory ""these lists only look at offense and don't consider defense"".  I'd agree it's a pretty good list but I consider Davion Mitchell much higher than this because I think he's the best rookie defender."
"Davion Mitchell gonna be top 3, watch out"
Hold up I was told Davion Mitchell was a lock for All Defensive Team

 I’m comparing him to a kid who is roughly the same age as him that he played against.   There are kids in this draft that are much older than him ie Davion Mitchell.  If having the 4th youngest player NBA history to drop 50   And the 1st youngest player in NBA History to drop a 50 point double double is hopeless   Then I love it here lol
"How is that nitpicking? I just listed how many guys are NBA players, a lot of good college teams will have a guy who dominated in college. A lot will have a couple guys who made the NBA for a year or 2 and wash out. And a lot will have guys that stick.  So if the G-League teams are deeper with good players from mostly smaller schools what does that really matter when the depth on the Ignite is even better?  Is Stauskas and Yuta really that much better than Davion Mitchell, and Jared Butler? Does it really matter if player 4-10 are good players from small schools who are a couple years older?"
somewhere in the 11-13 range imo. Along with Usman Garuba and Davion Mitchell.
Davion Mitchell means Fox is on the table.
"Davion Mitchell, Bagley, and Hield for a guy that as recently as 1y ago was an ALL-NBA 2nd team guy is Raps fans being delusional...got it."
"When your two awesome point guards are 6'3"" and 6'7"", you can afford to have three awesome point guards.  All three can be on the court at the same time if they need to be.  Davion Mitchell doesnt need the ball.  I love this move for the KANGS."
"The lean on his shot is the most correctable thing, though.  I feel like it would be more of a concern if he didn't have correctable issues with his shot.  But, yeah, the lack of size and elevation on his shot probably hurts.  I do think he is a more naturally talented shooter than Davion Mitchell, shot better pre-NCAA and better touch.  Like, he is a real ""if he shoots"" guy.  But he is an ""if he shoots"" guy that actually has some percentage chance of shooting.  This isn't a Scottie Barnes situation.  I do agree that the limitations scoring from the field hurt.  The terrible defense hurts.   But he has a clear NBA level talent for playmaking - getting to the rim and passing.  Josh Primo went 12th without a single plus NBA skill.  Many players that went ahead of Sharife are simultaneously worse and older."
Butler is the steal of the draft if he actually plays   Butler is honestly prospect wise probably better than Davion Mitchell imo due to his bigger frame and being 2 years younger. How much of a lock down defender can you really be if ur just 6'0 and thats Mitchell's best thing going for him as his offense for now is still questionable
"Okay first of all, you’re changing your entire trade proposal? Lmao. You said it was a protected pick, but now it’s unprotected? You also had Bagley, not DM. Buddy is a good shooter, cool, we already have GTJ who is fundamentally the same player + he’s much younger and cheaper. We don’t even have minutes for a Davion Mitchell who really isn’t that impressive and he’s the oldest player to be drafted in years.   You clearly don’t understand player value in the league. You also have to understand what you’re getting into if your team is dealing with Masai Ujiri. You’re incredibly biased towards your own team/players."
I really wanted Mitchell and here's my reasoning. The size issue is usually about defense and Davion is an excellent defender. So that should really be less of a concern unless he switched on to guys like LeBron and Kawhi. But he can defend any guard in this league and seems like a great kid. Plenty of guys his size in the league.
We somehow found 21.5 minutes a game for Cory Joseph last year before the trade deadline. I'm sure we can find something similar for Davion Mitchell. And there'll be plenty of room to do that if Buddy gets traded.
I hope this is true. Might also explain why the Kings went with Davion Mitchell when they already have two great guards. It would make sense if the Wizards are sending their pick Kispert plus some assets for Mitchell...Kispert would fit well on the Kings.
1) They want Haliburton to play more  2) That means Hield won't be more valuable than he is now  3) Dennis Schroeder would be trade bait and Davion Mitchell might not be ready to play on Day 1.
"Fam u just offered Buddy, Davion Mitchell and a 1RP for Pascal Siakam and tried to justify it. End of story."
"i forgot about the rookies Lakers drafted, i think that helps for salary filler, otoh this whole transaction is predicated on schroder wanting to play for the kings and the kings wanting to pay schroder what he wants (while also taking on the other odds and ends) and this seems implausible considering including the rookie they just got they already have 4 PGs (De'Aaron Fox, Delon Wright, Tyrese Halliburton, Davion Mitchell)."
Davion Mitchell and Haliburton will be good fits next to Ben Simmons when they trade Fox and Hield for him.
They’ll just laugh:  De’Aaron Fox/Haliburton/Schroeder   Delon Wright/Davion Mitchell/Ramsey  The Kings can’t get any more guards right? Right?
"It's fine. Monte McNair says Davion can guard 3's and 4's.  &gt;&gt; Monte McNair said Davion Mitchell was the best player available on the board. He believes he can guard four positions and had success in a 3-guard lineup in college, and he thinks Mitchell can defend in the NBA immediately.  https://twitter.com/mr_jasonjones/status/1420975084517351425"
"Davion Mitchell isn’t the piece to bring the Warriors to the finals. They need a vet and let Kuminga develop in the G-League, garbage time or in controlled spots off the bench. Or even trade him for an established player"
Let's think. Kings maxed Fox then drafted Haliburton. Traded for Wright and now drafted another PG Davion Mitchell 6 ft 23 years old.   Sacramento Kings just terrible organization even who runs the basketball operations doesn't matter. Everytime they find a way to be Kangz.
"Kings drafted Davion Mitchell at 9 just so he can play back up for Fox and Halliburton..  But yeah it’s the Spurs with the Primo pick, that’s just ineffable"
"Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield, 2022 unprotected 1st  Please 😭🙏🏻"
For Davion Mitchell they also highlighted him clamping Cade too
"Salary doesn’t match tho, I’m not sure how kings would attach more assets? Bagley? Davion Mitchell? Lol"
I had at least heard decent amounts about Davion Mitchell and figured the Kings just took their guy because they couldn't trade down. But Primo? Primo!?!? The Spurs better see something we don't or else that 2 year playoff drought is about to last for a long time.
"Bobby Marks on Davion Mitchell:  ""The finest human being I've ever been around.""  Went on mute right after that shit."
Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell (not actually brothers though)
"Funny story, Jared Butler winds up being a better NBA player than Davion Mitchell, who went to Baylor for the record"
"Best pick is Davion to the Kings imo. Haliburton, Fox, Mitchell is an amazing backcourt"
"As a Kings fan who just witnessed us pick Davion Mitchell with the #9 pick, I feel for y'all. We're also all a lil confused"
People underrate the hell out of Davion. His defensive highlights are nuts; people talk about his small length and size but that wont matter with how he uses his body and how he plays good D. Only reason I wouldn't take Mitchell as  the Kings is I feel like a development pick would be better given their standing.
Feel like Davion Mitchell was a stupid pick but he’s at 9th so can’t flame kings really at all.
It’s probably because Bilas is in love with Davion Mitchell.
"draftboard showing davion mitchell played for AUB when in fact, he played for BAY"
Why is no one talking about how Davion Mitchell will fit next to #2 overall pick Marvin Bagley?
"Davion Mitchell could easily slide in at the 2 spot if Klay is moving to the 3.  Brings defense, 3 point shooting, some playmaking.  I’m okay with the Kuminga pick but we had options"
Davion Mitchell listed in the table as Auburn smh
Warriors on most mock got Davion Mitchell and Corey Kispert..   Now they got Kuminga and Moody what the fuck
Because teams like the Kings will take Davion Mitchell 9th and not Moses Moody
Davion Mitchell for the 9th pick what the fuck
Toronto and Davion Mitchell are the bigger losers
Davion Mitchell now
Davion Mitchell is going to Sacramento
"Lots of surprises so far. Toronto passing on Suggs, Kuminga to Golden State, Davion Mitchell to Sacramento, and Ziaire Williams going top 10"
Davion Mitchell no question
"Davion Mitchell, Deaaron fox, Tyrese Halliburton all are basically point guards. Seems weird. I don’t know enough about Haliburton (big fan of his game though from what I’ve seen), but I don’t think davion or deaaron can shoot offball"
The tracker in this thread has Davion Mitchell as going to Auburn the blatant Baylor disrespect!
Anybody who wants to trash Davion Mitchell didn’t watch a Baylor game this season. Dude is a beast and absolutely NBA ready. I agree a dumb pick for the Kings since they have so many small guards but it’s not a dumb pick because of the talent. Davion has it all.
"It'll age great ""The Sacramento Kings had an off night when they picked Davion Mitchell"""
Davion Mitchell would have been perfect for the Grizzlies him coming off the bench for Ja would have been 🔥(fire)
Davion Mitchell and Pitbull have both been there done that
"I like the player but I'm unsure about the fit.   Davion Mitchell: A 6’2 guard coming off of a NCAA National Championship. Mitchell has a good combination of speed and ball control that allow him to create driving lanes and separation for pull up jumpers. Mitchell developed into an above average 3 point shooter (44% on 141 attempts) in his final season at Baylor. His questionable free throw shooting presents a question about his shooting though, did he just have a good year? As we all know free throw percentage can be indicative of shooting potential. Regardless Mitchell has the potential to be a 3 level scorer in the NBA at the guard position, exactly what every single team in the league is looking for. I believe Mitchell can be a player who can thrive with control of the offense for stretches but I would like to see him on a team that has multiple options for ball handlers, he is a playmaker but appears to be a scorer at heart.    On the defensive end Davion Mitchell provides strong defense on the ball but may have a limited ceiling on this end due to being a smaller guard. That being said there is definitely a place in the league for a guard that can excel playing on ball defense against other guards, as we recently saw with Jrue Holiday. I’d like to see Mitchell land somewhere with established wing scorer that can take some of the playmaking responsibilities and allow Mitchell to be a scoring guard.  &amp;#x200B;  More words here: https://www.picknscroll.com/2021/07/2021-nba-draft-3-prospects-to-watch.html"
Okay so they add some depth and hopefully defense if it translates. Very likely Hield leaves and getting some depth is great if you thought Mitchell was BPA.  I don’t hate it. Davion has some of the best footwork in this draft.
Can Fox/Hali/Mitchell play together? Davion is fantastic on defense but I don't think he's big enough to slide to the 3.   Is this indicating some sort of Fox for Simmons trade? Like what even in this.
"Baylor employed, er, I mean, *had on their roster* last year: a guard who was built like, played like, and wore #45 like, Donovan Mitchell named ""Davion Mitchell"" and a big man named ""Flo Thamba."" INVESTIGATE?"
Davion Mitchell looks kind of like a mix between Kel Mitchell and Nas
Davion Mitchell reminds me of Donovan Mitchell because the name is similar - ESPN
Davion Mitchell from Auburn? errr
Holes on wings and Holmes likely leaving and the kings select old ass Davion Mitchell. Lmfao.
davion mitchell looks like denzel curry
Davion Mitchell wears 45 too? What are the chances
davion mitchell looks like someone familiar...
"I'm not too familiar with Davion Mitchell, is this a LOLKANGZ moment?"
Do Davion Mitchell and DeAaron Fox work well together? I’m not so sure and that’s not even including Haliburton needing time as well
Davion Mitchell
davion mitchell if they’re trading hield
Would they actually pick a guy like Davion Mitchell?
Davion Mitchell? What the fuck.
I think it makes sense considering they have 14 and can grab an older guy like Davion Mitchell or Duarte
Warriors with yet another bust picked in the lottery       Should have picked Davion Mitchell or traded the picks
Honestly I’d take Davion Mitchell. He’s the most finished product and could help right away
Please for the mental health of nyc drop Davion Mitchell to 19.
pls davion mitchell to the warriors. i think he is the missing piece man
Davion Mitchell?
Davion Mitchell mom the actress that played precious?
"""Davion Mitchell""  I'm more of a House Steiner guy myself"
"They need to draft for the future to have the assets for a potential Beal/Dame deal. The Wizards would be more interested in a Kuminga than a Davion Mitchell.  Myers isn't about to come out and say ""We're drafting this guy to trade him in a few months"""

"In my homer opinion, I have a suspicion that in a way he'll benefit from NBA reffing. He already faced pretty good collegiate athletes like Davion Mitchell but in the NBA he'll be allowed to use his off arm more plus college refs fucking love calling charges over blocking."

"Ben Simmons end’s up on the Kings for 9, Hield, Bagley, and 2 future picks and 2 pick swaps.   76ers then take Josh Giddey or Davion Mitchell at 9."
Davion Mitchell- a 23 year old 6’1 PG who shoots 65% on free throws. seems like a pass
If this is the case guessing they are looking at Moses Moody or Davion Mitchell
Every single mock draft I've seen has Davion Mitchell going to Indy. No matter what changes before and after it's like he's guaranteed to go 13th.
Davion Mitchell and Primo will be the guys a few years down the line your like fuck wish we drafted him.
"Ayo dos from illi, Davion Mitchell from baylor . And I’ll just throw Alex antetekoumpo in there for good luck and raw talent / potential"
Davion Mitchell
"Alright, I'm going to take this seriously. Here are a bunch of things that are at least plausible individually- what's implausible is that everything goes right and all these things happen.   First, Fox takes another step up from ""extremely good"" to ""borderline superstar"". He put up 25/7 on decent efficiency last season. Let's say he increases that to 27/7 on better efficiency (maybe 37% from three) and he buys in to playing the type of defense full-time that we've seen in flashes.   Next, Haliburton takes a big rookie-to-soph jump. He put up 13ppg on outstanding efficiency last year. Let's say he gets up to 18-19 ppg and maybe 6 assists and rebounds per game and has a 50/40/90 season (he wasn't too far off as a rook).  Davion Mitchell isn't ROY, but makes a major impact as sixth man, setting a new tone for the team with vicious defense. His college three point shooting carries over and he averages 12/3/5 on solid efficiency due to shooting a ton of threes and hitting 41% of them.  Bagley still averages his usual 15/7, but his defense takes a big jump, he moves the ball unselfishly, his efficiency improves with smarter shot selection, and he learns to play within the team concept. Still not a great defender but he works hard and holds his own.  Richaun responds to the security of a long-term contract with his best season yet, throwing down lobs from Hali and Mitchell.  Barnes keeps up his solid play, but with defenses focused on other threats has his best season with the Kings- maybe 18ppg and excellent all-around play with very good defense.  Also, several other teams are wiped out by natural disasters..."
Early days to judge him but that was about where Davion Mitchell was projected. You can get another young talented guard!
Free Davion Mitchell imo
We can’t let the young goat Davion Mitchell rot away on the Kings
"if davion mitchell was guarding liangelo instead of bouknight then ball stans would stfu, also he's getting so many double teams"
Davion mitchell
yall should have drafted Davion Mitchell
Where are the Davion Mitchell highlights
LLLLLLL  Davion Mitchell crushed his whole team and people really just wanna talk about LiAngelo
Throw in Davion Mitchell then too /s
BC they drafted Davion Mitchell from Baylor when they also got Haliburton and DeAaron Fox?
"They were thinking:  1. Defense. 2. Mitchell was the best player left on their board.  I doubt it went much beyond that. Not to say there's inherently anything wrong with that approach, especially at the top of a draft class that had a lot of good players.  But most people just don't think Mitchell was actually the BPA, or that even if he was, the difference was not nearly enough that you can completely ignore fit/roster needs. ""BPA over fit"" is a great philosophy when there's one pick that's clearly significantly better than any other options. Luka would have been a great player to go BPA on. But typically there's only going to be a few of those picks actually available in a draft. Maybe there's a loaded top 1, 2, 3, etc and the teams in those slots basically just get whoever lands on them. Or maybe a player like Luka drops a position or two because some *other* team made the mistake of *not* taking ""BPA over fit."" But usually once you're into the 9th, 10th, etc, best player in a draft class, there's nowhere near enough of an *obvious* skill disparity to ignore fit.  Not saying players drafted outside the top few can't be good. Look at Kobe, Giannis, Steph, etc, many teams passed on these players. Rather, the point is, when you don't have that ""obvious all-star/superstar"" level of player in front of you, like Luka or LeBron, the ""BPA"" argument kind of falls apart because it's such a crapshoot as to how good a player will really end up being. And if you put a player in a position where they just aren't a good fit, that's just gonna make them *less* likely to reach their full potential.  In the end, I think Mitchell will end up being fine for us if we get rid of our other guards. But I don't think his ceiling is nearly as high as some of the other options that were available, Sengun especially. The bigger problem I have is that Mitchell never even worked out or seemingly had any contact with the Kings. So how could they have been so confident in his ability? It makes me feel like they *did* draft for ""fit"" after all, but rather than considering positional fit, they looked at what skills the team was missing, saw Davion was a good defender, and forgot about anything else."
"Given their contracts, I think Haliburton is more valuable than Fox anyways.  Don't get me wrong, Fox is the better player right now, but Haliburton is closing the gap and only making a combined 18 million over the next 3 years, while Fox is on a max deal worth 30+ million per year.  They also have Davion Mitchell now, and, personally, I think he pairs a little better with Haliburton than Fox anyways.  With Embiid, and his injury history, I don't think PHI would be interested in anything other than developed stars.  He's not the type of player who's likely going to be nearly 35 and still going strong.  I think they know they need to make the most of his time right now, so they wouldn't have any interest in anyone other than Fox.  I don't believe Hield + Barnes + picks + young players is going to sway them."
"Davion Mitchell being shorter than Trae makes me really question the Kings pick, hopefully he pans out"
"Well if I overreacted to Kuminga, Moosey and Davion Mitchell it’s only fair I over react here.   But honestly it seems like a lot of the rookies are settling in nicely for SL. No way to know how it’ll carry over to the regular season. Even then rookie year isn’t the end all be all. Kuzma and Lonzo were much more talked about than DeArron and Bam in 2017."
"Because it happens all the time. I was looking at this year's [draft combine](https://go.nba.com/8dyl) last night  Scottie Barnes is 6'7 without shoe and he is listed at 6'9 sometimes.  James Bouknight 6'3.5'', list at 6'5  Davion Mitchell, 6'0, listed at 6'2. Hes shorter than Trae who is 6' 0.5''  A lot of top drafts including Cade are missing. But I'm sure teams know, they met him in person, made sure hes taller than Isaiah Thomas. So two inches not a big deal. But I think NBA should really make these measurements available for all players."
Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell would clamp him up
De’Aaron Fox has the most chance tbh mf averaged 25 and 7 and is so slept on especially with not having to expend his energy of defense now with the addition of Davion Mitchell i just dont see how he doesn’t average 30 with improved FT and 3PT percentages.
No he's not rofl?  What about Davion Mitchell suggests he is going to pass up a game winning dunk because he is afraid of Trae sending him to the line.  What about Mitchell suggests that he is going to be terrified to shoot outside?
"&gt; What about Ben's game suggests he will improve?   He doesn't need to, Ben Simmons is already better than the realistic outcome of Davion Mitchell + mid round 1sts would be. You playing the odds here. Don't hurt yourself counterjerking too hard."
If I were the Kings GM I'd offer Buddy Hield + Marvin Bagley + Davion Mitchell + 2 FRP for him.  Kings need defense bad.
Davion Mitchell is 100% a bust   come back to this comment in a year and tell me im wrong i do not need to watch him play one minute at the NBA level to know that he is unfortunately a bust
Davion Mitchell.
"Davion Mitchell, he's special. Hopefully he'll reach his potential."
1. Cade Cunningham 2. Jalen Green 3. Evan Mobley  4. Scottie Barnes  5. Jalen Suggs  6. Josh Giddey  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Franz Wagner  9. Davion Mitchell  10. Ziaire Williams
Davion Mitchell?
"I'm not sure, they get an elite defender something they need, someone who can help them play bigger, they already have davion mitchell and haliburton to be guards as well as hield if he stays, simmons would be in a smaller market where he can do his business with less pressure from the outside."
Wait until davion Mitchell carry the kangz to playoff
"The Kings trading a top 5 shooter in the League and the best shooter on their team, for Ben Simmons doesn't make sense, on top of Fox not being a good shot creator. That trade is bad especially if Davion Mitchell is in the deal. But it's the NBA every trade seems dumb on paper n they happen every szn."
"Honestly, the Kings should just trade Fox and Hield for Ben.  The team is going no where with the current core but with a Haliburton / Mitchell back court and Ben at the 4, it offers them a great defensive foundation with great ball movement.  I am also a firm believer that Haliburton will be a better player than Fox in a year or two and that Davion Mitchell will be a star too.  The Kings are trapped in mediocrity and have only regressed since making the 9th seed in 2019, they need to take a swing."
"I think we’d offer literally any package as long as it didn’t  involve HALIBURTON or Fox. It doesn’t make sense for us to trade one of those guys for a package for Simmons. It would have to be a better player, But, these opportunities don’t happen often. I think Davion Mitchell, Barnes and Hield plus firsts for Simmons and one other guard, Shake Milton or Springer, is the best we can do. I think a third team being involved would help to if it redirected more talent to the Sixers faster. A team that would take the picks and even Bagley, in exchange for good starter. I think Philly can hold our a longgggg time and wait for something involving Dame or something. Their best package available is better than the Kings so…."
"Serious question, would y'all do trade Ben for Buddy, Bagley, an unprotected first and maybe Davion Mitchell? I have no idea what 76ers fans value Ben at rn, though I can guess that it's a LOT less than what Morey values him at haha"
"Oh my god, is this why the Kings drafted Davion Mitchell?!?"
"There’s a case to be made for him on the Kings.  He can fix their defensive issues and add a lot of rebounding and playmaking  However, assuming the package is say Hield, Bagley, Davion Mitchell, and say 2 1sts, Simmons value immediately plummets and his effectiveness on the offensive turns into a negative.   As seen in previous years, the 76ers have added multiple volume shooters in order to fix the absolute hell of spacing that Simmons creates. Including Hield, and elite volume shooter into the deal effectively limits the upside that Simmons brings as our spacing would be in shambles. Hali and Barnes both bring around 40% from 3 on a combined 9 attempts per game, but is it enough to not clog the paint whenever Fox is driving as a slashing PG? The Kings offensive scheme is fairly stagnant already, so unless Walton finally become a good head coach, the Simmons-Kings fit sounds like it’d be terrible, on paper at least."
"A lot of people were surprised he went undrafted this year. His contributions to the 2021 Baylor national team were overlooked since he wasplaying alongside Davion Mitchell and Jared Butler, but his shooting always provided a spark when our offense was cold. I'm hoping he can find a roster spot somewhere."
Don't forget Davion Mitchell
You’re right. He forgot to add on Davion Mitchell and 3 2nd rounders
"To Kings: Simmons To Lakers: Hield To Philly: Schroeder, Bagley and picks. Maybe throw in THT or Davion Mitchell if Philly wants it!"
Technically a Cali team and honestly the best Cali team that’s a fit for him.  Problem is outside of Buddy who isn’t enough Sac has nobody of interest for this trade to happen.  Maybe Davion Mitchell can be included as well but Hali and Fox should be off limits.
"Kings have better assets to fit with the Sixers tbh. They can trade Hield, and Haliburton or Davion Mitchell for Simmons and some picks"
Pascal Siakam has been traded to the Kings for a deal centered around Marvin Bagley and Davion Mitchell.
Kings took Davion Mitchell.
Not being Davion Mitchell
"Is Davion Mitchell, Buddy Hield and Marvin Bailey enough to get Siakam?"
"According to my sources, Sacramento could be shipping out a young guard for Siakam this offseason. Davion Mitchell + Bagley could get it done for the Kings."
"We just hired this GM and hasn't burned the team into the ground yet. Drafted Haliburton, didn't throw stupid money at over the hill vets, got us useful rotation guys on the cheap at the trade deadline, and while we are only one game of summer league in, Davion Mitchell looks like the real deal, and may be the team's best defender from the jump."
"I hope so. The facts so far are at least consistent with the idea that Hield to the Lakers is still alive. There's been no rumors about Schroder signing with a team, there's been no word on why the Hield deal fell apart at the last minute, the Westbrook deal doesn't take place until the 6th, and the Kings taking Davion Mitchell was kind of odd so maybe he is somehow involved too."
They have fox and Davion Mitchell.
You mean Hield + Davion Mitchell
"Drafting a raw prospect doesn't mean they don't want to win. Rookies really don't fit in with the Warriors timeline regardless of how ready they are.  There apparently weren't any good trade options for those picks, so they just made their draft picks.  They can potentially trade them for veterans if something comes up in the future.  But drafting Davion Mitchell isn't moving the needle on the Warriors title hopes.  Edit: If anything, it can be argued that younger prospects like Kuminga/Moody would be more desirable trade options than a rookie 4 years older."
Davion Mitchell is a reach for 7
Like Davion Mitchell?
"Davion ""Dragon Knight"" Mitchell"
Kings with ROY Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell and Luka
Davion Mitchell is so fine
"Inside the mind of Davion Mitchell:  ""I put the team on my fucking back doh. My leg broke, I don't know how the fuck I'm runnin right now doh"""
"Most analysts loved Mitchell. Davion slipped because of his size, age, history of poor shooting besides his final year of college. Honestly think he’s the Halliburton of this draft and teams just overthought it."
"Davion Mitchell is unhappy in Sacramento, league sources say. Mitchell is thought to prefer Utah as a trade destination."
Come on down future sixer Davion Mitchell
Sounds great!  Because I don't think the Kings have enough point guards.   Fox. Haliburton. Their draft pick (Davion Mitchell). And Schroder?   Sounds like an AMAZING point guard rotation. Deepest in league history.
"They’d have to get a 3rd team involved, no?  Wtf are the Kings gonna do with Shroeder when they already have Fox and Halliburton and then just drafted Davion Mitchell 9th overall"
Davion Mitchell whom the Kings drafted 9th the other day declined to comment on whether he participated in a work out for them.
Lolknicks narrative is outdated. Get with the times. We make fun of the Kings now. They just drafted Davion Mitchell when they have Fox and and Haliburton. So of course they would want Dennis.
"Lakers are going to have a bounce back season. 2020 people didn't believe them as much, but they proved that, almost fully healthy, they are an absolute force on defense and a healthy LeBron can turn any roster into a competent offensive roster. I don't think Russ will be that bad of a fit and he'll adjust well into his role, and a lot of veterans are going to play an important role on a championship run. They're also trading for Hield or a certified marksman or 2 this offseason,  I also think Davion Mitchell will be ROTY, Scottie Barnes will end up being the best player in the draft and Neemias Queta was the steal of the draft"
It makes no sense for kings to trade buddy for dennis after they drafted davion mitchell
Davion Mitchell is just one year younger than DeAaron Fox
Fox’s dad replied “no no no no no” to a tweet hyping up Davion Mitchell for the kings.
Davion Mitchell is gonna be a top 3 player when we look back.
Davion Mitchell will have a late growth spurt and can play the 3 and 4.
wow you saw one clip posted on reddit last night and now davion mitchell owns cade cunningham
Davion Mitchell has Dwayne Wade level athleticism paired with Damian Lillard range. He's going to be a future hall of famer.
"I mean their coaching and culture saw a massive change last year by swapping out a young an inexperienced rookie coach in Saunders for a prominent assistant from Toronto and the culture that comes with it in Chris Finch. Those have also been huge weaknesses for Sac since they swapped out Joegger for Walton.  But the fact is this team is vastly more talented than sac, they just haven’t been healthy at the same time. Last year Sacramento was the worst defensive team in the league, worse than Minnesota. What have they done to rectify that? Bring in davion Mitchell, a rookie at a relatively unimpactful defensive position?   And offensively it’s a wash. The wolves have the best player between both teams and probably 2 of the best 3 best. They also have one of the best 3 point shooting teams in the league. I’d bet on them making the 8 seed before I bet on the kings even making the play-in"
Davion Mitchell will be much better than Pat Bev
"Aint no one triggered by no truth lmaoo what truth that De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell are bringing the Kings back to playoffs? Clearly you’re the one that’s triggered by all these HYPOTHETICALS that you clearly dont seem to understand because you’re a laker fan that just spew nothing but bullshit thinking they know exactly how the seasons gonna go 😂😭 all Im doing is matching that same energy which is obviously is what triggered YALL 😭 like i said so fucking pathetic lmao but what else should i have expected from laker fans 😂😭"
"That’s cool bro De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell are still bringing the Kings back to playoffs, and you are correct, this isn’t the east 😭😂😂"
Davion Mitchell makes All-Defensive Second Team.
"De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell are bringing the Kings back to playoffs"
"The Kings have De’Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, and Davion Mitchell GUARANTEED for the next 5 years so Kangz"
Is Davion Mitchell for ROY considered a hot take?  Also either PG13 has an MVP-caliber season or Clippers have to fight through the play-in.
Jalen Suggs the supposed nba ready pg that doesn’t have the handles to play pg whatsoever  Wagner played terrible in preseason not a good sign especially when you compare him to duarte another pro ready role player prospect picked lower  Davion Mitchell seems like the new pat bev  Bouknight will be a worse version of Jordan clarkson at best until he improves his passing  those are the only players I watched
What’s not on the stat sheet? Davion Mitchell has been a BEAST defensively!
Davion Mitchell my pick for ROTY
Davion Mitchell makes an all defense team in his rookie year
Davion Mitchell
Scrappy hustle players and defensive dogs  AKA richaun Holmes and Davion Mitchell
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
What is that beta bitch going to do in the presence of the alpha chad Davion Mitchell?
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Davion Mitchell might be one of my favorite players
"Davion ""Off-Night"" Mitchell might have my favourite nickname in NBA right now"
Well Davion Mitchell neva lost
I’m convinced. I’ll bet my house that Davion Mitchell will literally never lose.
"davion mitchell has not lost a game as a member of the sacramento kings, and i do believe he may never lose again"
Davion Mitchell or Evan Mobley are my 1-2 ROY
The Warriors could have LaMelo and Davion Mitchell right now. But they chose two dudes who have no chance in the foreseeable future of being plus NBA pros
I won't watch many of their games because they're a west coast team but I'm excited to see how Davion Mitchell turns out
"MVP: Damian Lillard  MIP: Wendell Carter DPOY: Anthony Davis 6MOY: Cameron Payne ROY: Davion Mitchell  Not outright predictions, but if the stars align I think these players could walk away with some awards.  Dame is the backbone of Portland, and if they end up in a 1 or 2 seed come playoff time, I could see Dame walking away as MVP.  I was high on Wendell when he was drafted, but he has never really lived up to my expectations. I could see him taking a big jump offensively coming into his first full year in Orlando, if he gets his 11PPG up closer to the 20 mark, he will be a MIP candidate.  AD has always played third fiddle to Giannis and Rudy when it comes to DPOY. If he can stay healthy and get his BPG back to the 2.5 range, he could finally end up as the DPOY.   Cameron Payne is a little bias from me. but after the playoff run he had, I think monty will use Cameron Payne a lot more to give Chris paul some rest. He could win it   Davion Mitchell has just about everything he needs to be ROTY except for maybe the name recognition. Elite defender, and not a slouch on offence either."

Davion Mitchell is gonna sneak into that top 5 this year
Davion Mitchell GOAT confirmed
"Not to overreact to them going 3-0 in the preseason, but damn the team looks completely different than the poverty Kings of years past. The defense looks way better than anyone could've guessed, all the pieces are fitting well, they even have great depth. I'll break down the players in my opinion  FOX: 2nd best point guard in the league, could be 1st best this year, should have an MVP level season after coming back from injuries  Bagley: Unpopular opinion, but he's going to propel himself to the heights of players like Booker, Mitchell and Lavine  Haliburton: In my opinion the best rookie last year, I could see him averaging 20ppg this season easily. He also looks much better defensively  Hield: One of the best shooters in the league, need I say more  Ramsey: One of the best rookie defenders last year, has the potential to make an all defensive team this year, becoming the youngest ever to do so  Davion Mitchell: Arguably the 2nd best guard defender outside Holiday  Barnes: Great 3&amp;D player  Holmes: Elite defender and rebounder  Terence Davis: Naz Reid  In conclusion, I would be shocked if the Kings were lower than 5th seed in the West. The only rosters imo that are 100% better are the Lakers, Suns and Jazz. Discuss"
"The Kings aren't trading Fox. The 76ers aren't making a deal (at least with the Kings) without getting a young potential future all-star and multiple good playoff rotation pieces). Morey will want picks, but I am sure the mandate from ownership is get what we can to maximize competing now.  Ideally, if the Sixers had another 10 mil salary or can facilitate with a third team, I think Haliburton/Hield/Barnes would make a lot of sense, but they can't take back that much salary.  Perhaps they settle on Haliburton/Hield and a couple first round picks, which the Sixers can then flip. I think the Kings definitely do that, as they'd have no chance to make a playoff push with Mitchell and Haliburton's youth and positional duplicity with Fox in the crowded West.  Haliburton/Curry/Hield/Harris/Embiid with Maxey, Thybulle and Drummond is a pretty solid core playoff rotation. They'd probably have to stagger Curry/Hield for defensive reasons, but that's a well balanced squad that fits around Embiid.   And Fox/Davion/Simmons/Barnes/Holmes with Bagley is a sixth man is a 7th seed (possibly higher) to me. Fox and Simmons would kill teams in the regular season."
Davion Mitchell Rubbing his hands like Birdman rn
"Having Fox and Ben on the same team isn’t ideal roster construction since Fox isn’t a great shooter, though he’s improving year on year. But it still improves the team imo   Kings get:   * Ben Simmons   Sixers get:   * Buddy Hield   * Davion Mitchell  * Tristan Thompson   *2022 SAC 1st   I think this helps both teams"
"I've said for a minute that if Sacramento is serious on the Simmons sweepstake that the offer would have to be Harrison Barnes, TT and one of either Davion Mitchell/Tyrese Haliburton."
"He's 23, younger than Chris Duarte and the same age as Davion Mitchell..."
Davion Mitchell will be a straight up menace
By the end of this year Davion Mitchell will be considered the best perimeter defender in the league
"But this between two near-certain, guaranteed superstars, not Davion Mitchell over whoever. Two players with that amount of hype, it’s insane to think that you don’t weigh positional fit."
"Yes and no. If you really think Shaq is the future of the league, you would flip Sabonis or Turner for assets. Same reason the Kings drafted Davion Mitchell despite them having Fox and Haliburton. You take the best player available and either get creative with lineups or flip others for assets. Top tier talent rules the NBA."
Just saw Davion Mitchell recently and for someone that’s considered short for the NBA he looks gigantic in person.
Davion Mitchell will be in the top 5 for ROY and will at least make the 2nd All-Defensive team
"Sacramento drafted well. I saw him in summer league, and Davion Mitchell is the most unique athletic talent I've ever seen. His ability to stick to people is freakish"
If you like defense our boi Davion Mitchell is gonna be fun to watch this year
Davion Mitchell is a top 5 defender
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen
Jared Butler will be better than Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell will be better than Donovan Mitchell.
"i cant wait for davion mitchell to be legitimately bad in the NBA and then i dont have to hear about this ""off night"" bullshit from a 6'0"" player who isn't cp3 anymore"
"Plus, between Fox, Haliburton, and Davion Mitchell, where are the Kings getting time to maximize all these point guards? Swap one out for a high quality playmaking 4 like Simmons, who also runs the shit out of the ball - like the Kings should be doing."
He’s 20. People talk about him like he’s 23. Davion Mitchell is literally 3 years older as a rookie. THT will be in his 5th NBA season at 23.
"Look at 0:07 to 0:10. Paul George is trying to walk down Davion Mitchell and Mitchell is having none of it. He perfectly mirrors George's movements at the top of the key. When George decides to drive to the hoop, Mitchell is right there with him. It's incredible, really."
Davion “chick I’m tryin to hook up with” Mitchell
Ok so Davion Mitchell?
"GMs get it wrong sometimes but still have more access to resources when it comes to player evaluations than your average fan. So whatever they say holds more weight and value, if they’re wrong so what. But saying these GMs and the fans that agree with those GM’s are clueless because They voted for Davion Mitchell on this list makes no sense to me. Only time will tell but if either one of Scottie or Mitchell ends up as a top 5 player from this draft I wouldn’t be surprised at all."
Lmao this is hilarious. This guy really thinks Davion Mitchell is going to be Dame.
"Davion Mitchell probably has one of the highest floors in the draft. He’s a great defender and if his shooting translates he’ll have a long career, but when it comes to ceilings and potential, he’s not even top 10 from this draft class. Oldest guy in the draft, undersized guard, sure there’s a *chance* he ends up being a top 5 player in this draft but I would say it’s slim to none."
He has a better chance of doing that than Davion Mitchell tbh
"Interesting that they take a 28 year old Mitchell over players oozing with future potential like Kuminga, Sengun and Giddey. Even Scottie. While I think Davion can be a star he’s gonna get passed by at least 2 of those guys."
Davion Mitchell has some really nice odds for RoY imo. He was the fourth pick according to GMs to win it.
And now they have Davion Mitchell.
Guys I don't want to overreact but I think Davion Mitchell might be the next Michael Jordan
"Hi I’ve been drinking a lot of purple kool-aid these past few weeks  The Kings are gonna make a big jump. I’m not even exaggerating when I say they can even get up to 6th seed, but that’s assuming a lot goes wrong for other teams, like the blazers, clippers, warriors, and Mavs— and of course all the other potential play-in teams like minny, nola, and San Antonio  Of course I’m expecting us somewhere around 9-10. BUT kings have a few things working for us  Fox is a beast, and if he improves even more, like he has pretty much every season, he’s at an all star level. Tyrese Haliburton kicks ass and is going to be solid no matter what. Harrison Barnes is underrated af and at least league average. Richaun Holmes has like 95% accurate hook shot and can play great defense, and is a great roller on offense.   Our bench is the deepest it’s been in like 10 years. Yeah, it’s not the best, but now with guys like Buddy off the bench, Bagley if he makes a double jump- in terms of defense and health (he can be a walking 18/8), Alex Len to give us some size, Terence Davis for extra shooting and some defense, Harkless and TT for the vet presence, and potential up-and-comers like Chimezie Metu (ask Spurs fans) and our boy Davion MITCHELL to round it out  Obviously last year we had one of the statistically worst defenses ever, but we saw it get better to the end of the season. We got a couple new defensively minded assistant coaches in Doug Christie and Longabardi, we got some grittier players in our rookie Davion Mitchell AKA Off-Night, Terence Davis, Mo Harkless, Alex Len, and hopefully we embrace the chip on our shoulder of not being in the playoffs for so long  So, yeah I could go on and on about why I think we’ll be better. Even with Luke Walton, even with our shitty defense last season, even with our lack of traditional forwards. The kings are making a jump this year, into the play-in at least and hopefully right into the playoffs  I know the Kings are the joke of the league and have been for a long time but it ends this season. From Sacramento we’re gonna see a jump like the Knicks, hawks, and Suns had last year.   When all the media and you motherfuckers look back at the end of the season and go “wow we had no idea they were gonna be so good” I want you to look back at posts like these cause goddamn it some of us knew it was coming"
This is the year De’Aaron fox has to make the jump for the Kings to All Star.    Maybe an unpopular opinion but if he looks like he’s not making the jump and Simmons is available than I think you make that trade and plug Davion Mitchell in.
Davion Mitchell is still a rookie no way he gets those stats
Davion Mitchell and DeAaron Fox are both 23.
Luka (22) is younger than Davion Mitchell (23).
Davion Mitchell (Kings rookie) is already 23.
"You should have your hopes up really high. I watched a lot of Baylor and Butler is clearly better than Davion Mitchell. I’d have taken him in the lottery fr, biggest steal of the draft"
"Lakers underperform the regular season expectations due to lack of cohesion and (surprise surprise) Davis missing games. I'll go with a 4 seed.  Pelicans start bad and get desperate for a point guard to keep Zion happy; Davion Mitchell starts the season on a ROY pace; Philly starts mediocre with Simmons sitting out. All these things lead to a 3-way trade: Fox to Philly, Simmons to New Orleans, Ingram to Sacto.  With the monkey off their back, Milwaukee steamrolls to a top seed.  James Harden scores 50+ in his second return to Houston."
Fox becomes an MVP Candidate   Davion Mitchell makes all defence second team as a rookie   Kings get the 6th seed play Luka in the first round and beat them in 7 games   KPJ and Green carry the rockets to the play in game   Memphis regresses with the loss of JV  Philly eventually caves and trades Simmons for Brogdan and a pick
"- ATL: Hunter will win MIP. - BKN: Nash will find a way not to play Claxton again. - BOS: Nesmith will turn out to be a player in the mold of Covington much sooner than expected. - CHA: Plumlee will have a double double season with 4 APG. - CHI: Patrick Williams will struggle in his soph year. However, those counting him out long term will be wrong, as he'll develop in a major force after this season. - DAL: Tyler Terry will break out and play a decent role. - DEN: Zeke Nnaji will start pushing Gordon by shooting lights out. - DET: Jerami Grant will be traded before the AS game. - GSW: Poole will have at least 5 games in which he shoots 20 FG and hit under 6 of those. - HOU: Jalen Green will win ROY. - IND: Chris Duarte runner up for ROY. He'll post averages somewhere in the line of rookie Mitchell/Wade. - LAC: Will be very very disappointing. - LAK: Wayne Ellington is top 5 in 3pm this season. - MEM: Melton will, once again, play very limited minutes. - MIA: Haslem will play only a handfull of minutes but will be ejected from one game for a fight. - MIL: Grayson Allen will fill in nicely for DDV and might not give up tge starting position when DDV returns. - MIN: KAT will have a season which has him in the convo for MVP but ultimately not win due to team record. - PHI: Jaden Springer will surprise. He will become what people hoped Zhaire Smith would be, before he nearly died. - PHO: Mikal Bridges does not take that next step. - POR: Nassir Little top 5 MIP. Larry Nance 6MOY. - SAC: Haliburton and Davion Mitchell will make at least 5 starting backcourts cry this season. - SAS: Devin Vassell still will be disappointing.  - TOR: Khem Birch will average a double double. - UTA: Bojan will be traded before the AS game. - WAS: Gafford will post a pts/blk/reb triple double."
"but then if they chose the kings someone would've commented ""weird that they chose davion mitchell and the kings when franchises like the wolves and the magic exist"""
Davion Mitchell and Suggs will get the playing time.   Cade also but the payout isn’t as great
I see kings fans saying they won't even trade a rookie (Davion Mitchell) who's literally never played an NBA game for Simmons. You'd think teams that continually rack up 20-30 win seasons and perpetually get absolutely nowhere would realise they need to make moves.
"Thought drafting Davion Mitchell was going to be a poor decision… now I’m convinced we have a 3 headed monster of a backcourt in Fox,Hali,Mitchell"
"Dude no. You must have no idea what GMs think about when drafting. Age is such an important factor in drafting. Otherwise Davion Mitchell goes #3, ahead of Barnes and Suggs this year. You have the most growth when you are 18-24, so it means a lot. Do you know how good LeBron would be as a rookie if he went to college 3 years and then went to the NBA?"
"Marcus Smart, Davion Mitchell, and Ivica Zubac"
I love Davion Mitchell. Kings definitely got a good one
"Credit to this Kings team, they are playing hard and fast, taking good shots.  I was told Davion Mitchell was just a lock-down defender, but he's looked smooth offensively too!"
Always been a slow starter and also...  Last year they added Halliburton as a back court team mate and then this year added Davion Mitchell.   All while buddy hield should prolly be the starting 2 guard next to fox.  (I like Halliburton tho)
"Agreed Tisse definitely the most electric defensive presence in the league. Davion Mitchell could get there in a season or 2, love him early"
Davion Mitchell fanclub wya
"People like KOC and The Athletic guys weren't really pushing Giddey for 7th lol If anything, they were pushing Davion Mitchell or Franz Wagner for 7th due to their ability to contribute now. Moody &amp; Bouknight also received some support pre-draft too"
Sorry to tell you but trading your entire future for Harrison Barnes Tristan Thomson Marvin Bagley and Davion Mitchell isn’t doing anything to raise their potential ceiling.   &gt;Getting a player like Barnes who could be a deadly 2nd/3rd option is what the Warriors need to do for Steph.  I’m just going to assume you started watching basketball 2 weeks ago lol
"7th pick was either going to be Giddey or Moody assuming Kuminga wasn't available (which he was.) 14th pick was either going to be Duarte or Davion Mitchell (both were gone by then, but luckily Moody was still there.)"
He had some good highlight defensive plays against Mitchell but I don't think he caused he caused Mitchell's bad shooting night. Mitchell has just started out slowly this year like he does every year. He missed plenty of wide open shots against Davion.
"Jared Butler is the obvious one. He’s the NCAA tournament MVP and literally better than Davion Mitchell while being 2 years younger.   I hope he’s able to go to a bad (or okay) team so he gets starting minutes off the jump n prove his worth. If he’s able to get minutes, he’s a lock for an all rookie team. I’d love him on the Knicks for example, he could start from day 1"
"May be drafted higher than expected: Usman Garuba, Josh Giddey, Joshua Primo  May fall: Davion Mitchell, Kai Jones"
I think Davion Mitchell falls tbh. I don’t think he has a high upside but he will be productive from day 1. I hope the Warriors can get him at 14.
Anyone drafting Davion Mitchell before the mid-20's will be disapointed imo.
"Warriors - I'm fine with Davion Mitchell, but please God not at #7. Of the guys they might reasonably pick at #7 (Kuminga, Bouknight, Wagner, Giddey, Moody), I'm cool with all of them for one reason or another."
I don’t know what I’m getting out of Siakam in the playoffs.  I am not certain he will show up.  7 and 14 is something like Jonathan Kuminga and Davion Mitchell - it’s a lot.  I won’t stick my nose up at 7 and 14 this year.  Look at everything that Memphis did just to get to 10.
It's more likely Davion Mitchell is picked after the 13th pick than before
"Guys like Davion Mitchell may not have the highest ceiling, but they have the physical tools and the type of game that will instantly translate without needing serious development.   Mitchell, for example, is gonna be a fantastic defensive presence off the bench who has already proven he can create his own shot."
"&gt; You are being a huge homer if you think the Hawks wouldn't accept the number 7 pick for him instantly.   No I'm really not, I think you don't understand the struggles 95% of rookies coming into the NBA are negative value players. He's literally *younger* that guys mocked there like Davion Mitchell and the same age as Franz Wagner while offering more upside.  It's not that I'm overrating Cam, you are overrating the impact that rookies have in the short term. The Hawks are trying to be a playoff team. I'd rather trade Cam for a proven NBA player than pick 7."
"Kuminga is a raw prospect and the GSW dont wanna waste Curry, Dray, and Klay's prime  by getting players that are gonna take a long time to develop. If they really want players that would help them, they should get James Bouknight, Keon Johnson, Moses Moody, Davion Mitchell, Corey Kispert."

I want Davion Mitchell but it’ll probably be Primo.
"LOL Denver must be trying to redeem themselves for ever trading the pick that was Donovan Mitchell. Now they can draft Davion, squint real hard and convince themselves they never made a mistake back in 2017"
I’ve been saying it makes no sense why Davion Mitchell is rated higher than Jared Butler. think Butler and Bones Hyland will be the biggest surprises in terms of surprise rookie seasons come next year
It's really not that rare for top college guys to have won their whole career. I bet Davion Mitchell fucked shit up in highschool ball too.
We’re about to have Donovan and Davion Mitchell with both wearing 45
"In the worst-case scenario in which they have to use their picks they can get some really solid bench depth that they're hurting for.   Davion Mitchell at 7 seems solid, especially considering their bench PG is *checks notes* Nico Mannion.  At 14 I'd go for a roleplayer wing - Chris Duarte, Moses Moody or Trey Murphy.   PG: Steph / Davion  SG: Klay / Poole / Damion Lee   SF: Wiggins / #14 / Kent Bazemore  PF: Draymond / Juan Toscano  C: Wiseman / Looney  That's a solid lineup in the West. Obviously it depends on the big 3 playing out of their minds to get deep into the playoffs but the talent is there."
Jared Butler and Davion Mitchell is proof that there is a parallel universe
"So? A player is wide open every single time and you can double someone on defense every single time.  We are talking about the best college team vs the worst NBA team (which probably also has bad chemistry). The talent difference isn’t as big as you think it is. Team USA has gotten beat by teams in France, Australia, and Nigeria who are clearly way less talented in 5 v 5. And here I’m talking about OKC without Shai…and the college team here has 6 players vs 5 on the Thunder.   You also do realize the Thunder without Shai were playing guys who besides Lu Dort are ALL worse than Davion Mitchell and possibly Jared Butler too  right? Maybe Poku has some upside, but Davion Mitchell could literally already be better than every single Thunder player who was playing at the end of the season except Dort. Just look at the names and ages on that Thunder team at the end of the season…  I feel like literally everyone who always says the NBA team can beat the college team (5 v 6) never played basketball before. Anyone who’s played basketball and ran any sort of 5 v 4 drills or 3 v 2 drills (where you have 1 fewer player on defense) would tell you how much easier it is to score when you have 1 extra player. The whole point of that drill is for the defensive players to suffer since they can’t move on until they get a stop."
Davion Mitchell would be great as a spark plug bench guy first and then eventually maybe evolve into a bigger role. Perfect guy for the Grizz other than just a spot up shooter.
If I had to guess their target would be Kai Jones? I want them to take Davion Mitchell though.
Jones at 10 would be crazy. I could see them going for moses moody or davion Mitchell around that spot
"Thats a long video, what exactly did he say? Because they have had a lot of players workout for them.   &gt;Among likely first-round picks, the Warriors have worked out Florida’s Tre Mann, G League Ignite’s Isaiah Todd, LSU’s Cameron Thomas, Arkansas’ Moses Moody, Duke’s Jalen Johnson, Texas’ Kai Jones and Baylor’s Davion Mitchell.  &gt;On Friday, Tennessee’s Keon Johnson, Oregon’s Chris Duarte, Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert, Virginia’s Trey Murphy III and Stanford’s Ziaire Williams will work out in front of the Warriors brass."
Moody and Davion Mitchell
Davion Mitchell   18/4/3  48/43/75
Patrick Beverly is such a terrible comparison though. He is going top 8 no question because he is that special.  Consensus top 8. He is at the very least a good scorer on the NBA level and will be a great defender. Patrick Beverly is a good defender but he has trouble on defense where Davion doesn't. Davion is like a Lugentz Dort-level defender with the offense potential of Donovan Mitchell. He can fight through screens can switch regardless of size and is way more disciplined that Pat Bev. Pat Bev is mostly heart while Davion is almost all skill defensively. Also this is why he fits yalls timeline. At the very worst he's an amazing 6th man and a specialist defender. Hes going top 10 for a reason if you watch more than just highlights you would see that the way he gets his shots are consistent enough to show its not a fluke. He figured his game out. He may not have the ceilings Cade has but he's the best available guard to yall. OKC is taking Bouknight. Davion is an experienced guard with still a ton of ceiling offensively and will immediately be one of the best defensive guards in the NBA period.

Davion Mitchell is the best player in this draft.  Warriors' 7th and 14th pick will be a bust.
Hotter take…Davion Mitchel is actually Donavan Mitchell and the nurses fucked up at the hospital and gave the wrong baby to the wrong parents
Davion Mitchell will be by far the best player from this draft. A future hall of famer and will be a near universal top 40 all time player.
My hot take is that Davion Mitchell actually is related to Donavan Mitchell and they are just trying to keep it quite to help Davions draft status for some reason
Davion Mitchell isn’t a top 20 player
I don’t think Moody goes over Davion Mitchell but I could be wrong
Just tryin to show Cade a good time before they draft Davion Mitchell #1
