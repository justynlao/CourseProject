Lavine is having a nice season. His steady improvement on the offensive end each season has been impressive. His efficiency this year is fantastic on high volume.   However there’s still legit concerns about how he would perform when it really matters. Last season rookie Matisse Thybulle really took it to him. And this year New Year’s Day jrue really locked him up. He’s also struggled against the Celtics various defenders. These are the type of elite locked in defenders he’d face in the playoffs whenever he eventually gets there.  Lavine is also leading the league in turnovers.
"DC as a big city should have winning on it's radar. Every big city wants to have a winning sports team. Fortunately DC already has winning sports teams, just not in Basketball lol. But the annoying thing is that DC has the potential to have a great basketball team. Clearly two cornerstone players are here but right now the whole roster is a mixture of being a rebuilding project with pieces that want to contend. It's not right. It's a shame Atlanta absorbed such a high amount of FA last off season. Maybe someone changes their mind and decides to play in the nation's capital but really why bother when there are warmer cities that have cap space and the other north east cities are clearly contenders while DC just bumbles along with some of the best offensive players in the league.  Some of this has to do with just a bad FO though, like yes some of the young guys drafted have potential and some of them not showing their full ability falls on the coaching staff but good lord the supporting pieces, like could DC have made a better decision around what makes sense when you have a great offensive weapon already? Like yes bringing in Robin Lopez is supposed to boost defense a little bit but would it have been better to have taken Matisse Thybulle instead of Rui where Matisse looks like a defensive beast. Of course Rui still has potential and all that but man what is a guy like Raul Neto supposed to bring? A plug and play offensive player that is undersized and cannot do much else? Like is having him in addition to Ish Smith. Oh man and of course the year after we extend him Bertans the ""Latvian Laser"" is now shooting 32% from 3. Like wow if his production stays down low this long then that's an awful contract for a player that no longer has any upside."

"Matisse Thybulle - his stats aren’t great but he plays hard D. Long arms and active hands make him a bit of a pest. If he can develop his shooting (which I don’t think his far off) he can be a premier 3&amp;D. Unfortunately this means he likely is gunna get traded a bunch of times which sucks a philly fan. If anyone watched the Sixers v Lakers you could tell he was bothering LeBron (to an extent, I mean it’s still Bron)"

 Matisse Thybulle had a very good game tonight.  Really incredible defender.
kemba has nightmares about matisse thybulle
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I’ll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"

"This is what I'd do:  **Minnesota Receive**: Ben Simmons  **76ers Receive**: Bradley Beal  **Wizards Receive**: Minnesota FRP (unprotected?) 2022/2024/2026 + pick swaps 2023/2025/2027, Anthony Edwards, Jarret Culver  Matisse Thybulle (PHI), Philly 2022 FRP (Top 15 protected, if not conveyed then 2 SRP)  Hawks FRP (Protected Top 20, 2022-2025, if not conveyed then SRP 2025/2026 conveyed), Tony Snell  **Hawks Receive**: Ricky Rubio  You could sub out the Hawks for a different team that you think could use Rubio more (maybe Blazers/Heat/Pacers/Bucks)."
"&gt; it was reported that the Sixers offered a package centered on Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and draft compensation, but would not go so far as to include rookie Tyrese Maxey, whom Houston wanted.   Though, it does go onto say that the more believable theory is that Tillman refused to trade with Morey. So, I suppose it’s just all hearsay at this point."
"&gt;  so how exactly were we overvaluing them when the rockets thought the same thing just tilman said nah because we have morey?  Oh the problem here is that you're so sure this is what happened  Are you one of those people who only read the title of [this reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ky490f/pompey_the_sixers_thought_they_had_a_deal_for/)?  Because this is the content of that Pompey article:  Title: &gt;Did the Houston Rockets use the Sixers to secure the Brooklyn Nets’ best deal for James Harden?  Content:  &gt;After analyzing the information surrounding the Harden trade, yes, the Rockets did play the Sixers.  &gt;Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta did not want to make a deal with the Sixers due to Morey leaving Houston to become the Sixers president of basketball operations, as reported. And if he made a deal, Fertitta was only going to make it for Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal.   The last sentence is hilarious. Reminds me of the fans that are hesitant at the thought of giving up Maxey too to get ""a guy who insists the game revolves around him and has never put it together in the playoffs"", as one sixers fan put it."
"Because offense is inherently more important than defense in basketball. The 01 run made it especially clear that the entire Lakers roster could play decent defense while also being able to play offense, while the Sixers players were decent to good defenders that couldn’t hit a layup if their life was on the line. It’s the same reason why Matisse Thybulle struggles to break the rotation but Seth Curry is a starter. the reason they lost is because Shaq had no problem scoring on the Sixers’ “elite” defensive players, and even if he sat the rest of the team could field a good offense. Meanwhile Shaq and Kobe would essentially soft double Iverson and just let Eric Snow brick free throw line shots. “Elite defense” falls apart against great offense in the NBA which is why you can list defensive accolades all day but that Sixers team around Iverson was just not anywhere near as good as most other finals teams in history"
"&gt;He makes no money..impossible to trade for anyone significant.  That's not quite true.  I'm not saying that this is a sensible trade, but just for example, he could be traded for 2 years of Donte DiVincenzo straight up.  Or Matisse Thybulle and 3 years of his contract.  His salary would fit with trading for Alex Len, if the Lakers decided they do need an actual backup center.  There aren't many players making sub $3M, but there are a few interesting ones -- Caruso included."
"Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks sounds reasonable.  Curry, Green, Harden, Tobi, Embiid with Shake, Kork, Scott, Dwight is still pretty good. They could probably find some defensive wings or four."
"The article leaves some room for the Rockets making the trade.   “And if he made a deal, Fertitta was only going to make it for Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and two draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal.”"
"If Masai accepted trading Lowry for Matisse Thybulle as the main returning player, I'd immediately go to the Air Canada Centre and demand to see Masai to ensure he hasn't been drugged or kidnapped or blackmailed.  Thybulle has played 13mpg in 10 games this season so far and has looked terrible so far. We already got OG who fills the low volume 3nD wing except he is a better defender, better shooter, bigger frame all while being the same age. We already have Patrick McCaw, Nick Nurse favourite, who is a 3nD wing who actually plays as a backup PG (tho he is currently out) for us making him more valuable than Thybulle. We got Stanley Johnson who has surprisingly been good and fills the bottom half of the rotation energy hustle defense wing spot that Thybulle basically is. We got DeAndre Bembry who we just signed and could easily step in for a bench wing role with some ball handling.  Thybulle is just not valuable to the Raptors."
"depending on how he looks between now and March, i think Philly would be a good spot for him.   Green(salary) plus Thybulle?   Or combine in a seperate trade they could give a 1st for Tucker and use our trade exception.   It would be two deals, but Green, Thybulle and 1st for PJ and Dipo.   Everyone is expiring except Matisse."
Harden's good but he's no Matisse Thybulle.
Defensive specialist/Vlogger Matisse Thybulle
So is thybulle though. my point is that if Matisse is being discussed like some crazy asset it doesn’t make sense why furkan isn’t either lol
"How delusional are Sixers fans? Find out today after Harden gets dealt to them. Get ready for your daily ""We should have dealt 11th man Matisse Thybulle and that would've been enough."" and ""Ben Simmons is literally better than James Harden."" takes!"
lol you really think matisse thybulle is gonna stop a james harden trade?
"Matisse ""1 ppg on 19 mpg in the playoffs"" Thybulle  But he makes good videos tho"
"We got a barely used Matisse Thybulle for y’all instead! He has a great YouTube vlog and everything, and his smile is wonderful."
"We have a shiny Matisse Thybulle, he is a very nice person. You don't want Maxey Houston, trust me."
"I’d prefer not to give up Shake or Maxey if we’re already giving up both Simmons and Matisse. They are huge off the bench for us and will be integral pieces in future championship runs especially since they’re on cheap deals.   Simmons, Thybulle, and a couple firsts beats out any deal Brooklyn can make imo."
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
"I think these records should count in the official NBA stats as well. Yes, Matisse Thybulle really averaged 69 points a game during the 2021 NBA season"

"&gt;best upgrade that’s actually obtainable without giving up Simmons  Yeah lets be real this proposal isnt actually a particularly compelling offer, an expiring contract of Danny Green, two late protected picks and Matisse Thybulle these arent high quality assets. It's a bunch of C- level assets. I would agree the circumstances under which a player as good as Lowry being realistically available for this kind of mediocre package are probably unique, probably wont get another chance as good as that the next 2 yrs. The thing you might roll the dice on is if you can find talent at the margins the next 1-2 yrs and get like 2 dirt cheap UFDA/2nd round type real rotation level players where if you do that you can offer this general kind of package but maybe get someone even better. But it's obviously a gamble.  &gt;his season, he’s almost welcoming the doubles  Yeah he has I'm not going to be 100% entirely sold on it even if he keeps up until it happens in the playoffs but it's a good start. Beyond shot creation I still do think the lack of playmaking beyond Simmons who has his half court limitations is a problem, it goes under the radar but teams who lack playmaking really just dont win at the highest levels it's quite rare. This is where Lowry would really help   &gt;I’d feel a lot worse about our chances if Boston or Brooklyn swung a trade for a star after we sold the farm for Lowry.  Keep in mind Dinwiddie injury really weakens BK's chances of making an in season move to improve their defense. Boston I think the Kemba injury is a big thing, I think this might be a relative down year for them and they might also know it internally. Things are kind of aligning in a way more and more where this season might be the most open the East is the next 5 yrs.   &gt; large looming trade pieces (and more will appear  Yeah it's always impossible to predict and guys will get dealt thing Ill say though is I think we might be headed for a quieter next 2 yrs in terms of transactions. You look at the top stars and the top young players, just so many of them are under contract through like 2024 which wasnt how things were the past 3-4 yrs with all this chaos"

You know your team quit when Matisse Thybulle can drive for an uncontested layup
It's like when Alex caruso or Ben Simmons hit a three or Matisse Thybulle scores on your team. You know the defense is lacking
Matisse thybulle is other-wordly at this. Its actually pretty fun to watch.
Matisse Thybulle is my daddy
It would take Matisse Thybulle to get starter level minutes
Best I can do is Matisse Thybulle and Dwight Howard.
Unless you're Matisse Thybulle
Matisse Thybulle?
"Yes, the cutting from the wings by Ben and Thybulle are a huge reason this works. Forces the wing defenders to bump down so they can’t help to the corner after the pass.   Ben + Matisse are also huge targets to throw passes to, so you really have to respect their cuts."
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he’s taken some spectacular leaps)  I’d say the last few years we’ve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I’d say we’ve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"It’s ducking hilarious, especially games when Danny is on, or when Thybulle is in. Work really fucking hard to get a switch off Thybulle, just to turn into Ben. Reset offence, work really hard to get a switch, switch onto Green. Work really hard to create some space, drive, look up, embiids there. Try to pass out ‘oh no there goes Matisse with his stealing hands’"
"And of course, the secondary god Matisse Vincent Thybulle"
"Yes 76ers are definitely winning because of Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle. Yall are winning because of your best players, which you won't give up, so the record is irrelevant. I suppose Nets have a lot of assets to give up too by that logic"

Don't act like you won't be crushed if Matisse Thybulle is left off again!
I’m curious which young guy Philly values more. Thybulle or Maxey.   I’d lean toward keeping Matisse right now just because he’s elite at half of the game even if he’s nothing on offense
Matisse Thybulle is absolutely smothering in zone defense
"If I had to redraft the top 10 it would actually be pretty close to the initial selections:  1. Zion Williamson (#1) 2. Ja Morant (#2) 3. RJ Barrett (#3) 4. DeAndre Hunter (#4) 5. Coby White (#7) 6. Rui Hachimura (#9) 7. Tyler Herro (#13) 8. Matisse Thybulle (#20) 8. Lugentz Dort (undrafted) 9. Keldon Johnson (#29)   Other players that outperformed their picks include Brandon Clarke (#21), Grant Williams (#22) and Kendrick Nunn (undrafted).  Players that dropped out of my top 10: Darius Garland, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish, but all of them would probably be in the 11-20 range"
"Kyrie is the easy answer. I’ve never seen a more fluid-like game, ever. And everyone loves to talk about his handles, but I think he has the best jump shot form in the league, tbh.  Also, Matisse thybulle playing defense.  ...and I wish the correct answer for this was DRose. I miss watching him healthy."
This is as bad as the shit trades they're saying we'd take for Lowry. They don't want Powell and Baynes.     They want one of Terence Davis/Matt Thomas/Malachi Flynn and one of Matisse Thybulle or Tyrone Maxey. They also want a FRP or potentially two FRP's. Maybe even a second. Maybe even a swap.
"Simmons, Smart  Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown (categorized as guard in All Star)  and my homer pick, Matisse Thybulle. Throw in Beverly, Gary Trent Jr., Paul George, Gary Harris, etc.  I’m not saying all of these guys are better than Vanvleet, I’m just saying he’s not one of the top 4."
"How does Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green and like 5 late firsts sound?  Irresistible, I know"
"But like... by some of the advanced metrics that try to measure defense, Jokic doesnt rate out that much worse than Embiid. DBPM he's quite high for instance, among others. He gets a ton of steals for a center which is arguably more valuable than blocks since blocks dont necessarily result in a change of possession.   I'm just saying, the idea that Jokic is a bad or awful defender is just flat out false. He's a solid defender who struggles with one VERY specific matchup type that even guys like Rudy Gobert sometimes struggle to shut off. Furthermore - I'd wager that Jokic's defensive stats would look even better if he was playing with Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Danny Green, and so on. Jokic's supporting cast is extremely light on guys who can defend, let alone on the most important kind of defenders in today's NBA - wing/perimeter defenders."
"Considering that Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle were notified that they were being traded, I’d be willing to bet that Houston’s FO accepted a Simmons deal before Fertitta vetoed it for pride reasons."
"Tobias Harris, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, wait, we dont have anyone named dinwiddie."
Matisse Thybulle Effect.
One day Matisse Thybulle is gonna gain the ref respect and not be called for ridiculous fouls and end up averaging 3.5 steals a game
"&gt; 2019 - Drafted Romeo Langford and Grant Williams over Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle (hell, they traded Thybulle to the 76ers for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao)   Keldon Johnson's really the guy I regret missing out on at the end of the 2019 first round. Clarke had a great rookie season, but if his jumper is broken that could be a problem and Thybulle's got a long way to go too. I'm not willing to give up on Langford yet either; he's just been star-crossed by injuries."
"the australian citizenship thing is weird. Like Ben Simmons is Australian because he grew up there and his Mom is Australian. Matisse Thybulle plays for Australia and he's a citizen, and he chose to play for Australia as opposed to US.   Kyrie I beleive has dual citizenship, but has chosen to play for USA"
funny thing was that our fanbase loved Matisse but was furious we had to give up Edwards b/c we tipped our hand wanting Thybulle.

"Underrated:  * Royce O’Neal * Derrick Favors * Jamychal Green * Cam Payne * Justin Holiday * Thad Young * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate   Overrated:  * Marc Gasol * Lou Williams (maybe less so now) * Carmelo Anthony * Robert Covington * JJ Redick  * Matisse Thybulle * Donte DiVincenzo  * Whatever G-Leaguer the Heat have turned into a 6th man of the year candidate that just signed a big contract  It’s like the other guy says, good or large teams that have a lot of fans and a lot of attention on them will generally have their role players overrated, bad teams and small market teams will generally have their role players go under the radar."
"I hear that. I guess I just look at serious development as very difficult and sometimes rare rather than a lack of effort in most cases.  Like Matisse Thybulle certainly knows he’d be way better if he could even somewhat dribble, and could consistently attack close outs, and I’m sure he works hard to improve at those things, but he’s so far behind the NBA level at those things that he may never get to an average level."
Needed a guard. The Sixers are the #2 ranked defense. Shake Milton has the 2nd best defensive rating on the Sixers (behind Matisse Thybulle who is not a guard) and the 6th best defensive rating in the entire league.
"Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, and a 1st, ring it up baby"
Matisse Thybulle
"As you guys probably recall from his bubble vlogs Matisse Thybulle is one of the funniest and most genuine players in the NBA. I have been saving some of my favourite clips that I have seen of him on /r/NBA and Twitter, as well as a few snippets of his vlogs for a while. I figured that I should compile them all together and decided that I should share it with you guys as well. Hope it can bring a smile to your face!  [Also if you want to see more funny clips of him I have linked the full video which includes most of the content in this video, but has a few more minutes here. Enjoy!](https://youtu.be/ovDgAa2CvJc)"
"You mentioned Shake Milton, but didn't mention Matisse Thybulle. You might want to watch a Sixers game at some point 😂"
"Matisse Thybulle had to save Ben ""1st team All Defense"" Simmons there. Man was getting exposed"
The Matisse Thybulle impact
don't let the stats lie to you he got clamped by matisse thybulle
I like to think Matisse Thybulle just has the world's longest fingers
"&gt; Hardly any at all, Simmons plays heavy minutes with Dwight Howard and Matisse Thybulle who are both awful shooters  One of these dudes has 100% 3pt in the Finals. Put respeck on his name, please."
"Sixers has agreed to trade Danny Green and Matisse Thybulle to Toronto for Kyle Lowry and u/TopBeer3000, sources tell ESPN."
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
"Yeah the celtics definitely would have had to trade brown or tatum to get a star, it's not like they have wasted 7 first round picks on Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Matisse Thybulle (traded), Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Desmond Bane (traded) in the past 3 years 😂😂😂. Definitely can't trade draft picks 😂😂"
"Hardly any at all, Simmons plays heavy minutes with Dwight Howard and Matisse Thybulle who are both awful shooters, the reason behind this disparity is because the Sixers have no one else to create besides Simmons on the roster"
crazy how much better Matisse Thybulle turned out to be
"I'm not saying he's better overall than those guys but his per 36 stats are absurd:  Matisse Thybulle: 2.8 steals and 1.8 blocks  Compare that to the career best per 36 numbers (in a single season) of the guys you mentioned and it's up there: Gary Payton:  2.6 steals, .2 blocks  Tony Allen: 3.1 steals, 1.1 blocks  Kawhi Leonard: 2.6 steals, 2.0 blocks"
Matisse Thybulle would win DPOY this year if his offense was competent enough to allow him to play 30+ minutes per game
Matisse Thybulle aka the Black BigBoutros
"Because a lot of people really don’t like Ben Simmons and, more reasonably, expect a steady diet of Matisse Thybulle who is an offensive non-entity."

Matisse Thybulle amazes me.
"Sonics fan, team I identify most with is the thunder. When the Sonics left, the thunder got all the players I was attached to, so of course I still liked them, mostly KD. When KD went to the warriors, I liked the warriors the most because KD was there. As time grew, my attachment to KD has weakened, but he’s still my favorite player so I like the nets. My favorite current team is probably the sixers, because they have Matisse Thybulle, who I was a huge fan of in college. I also think Ben Simmons is super dope. Also every west coast team except the blazers are cool in my book because I love the west coast. So in order the teams I like are the sixers, nets, thunder, all California teams. Also like the Orlando magic too because they have Fultz. Nuggets and mavs are cool too. In reality I like pretty much every team that’s not the Celtics, Raptors, or blazers. Even with that I like the current version of the Celtics, just not the franchise. So I just like most teams overall I guess is the main takeaway. I like watching good basketball.  TLDR: KD is my favorite player, I go where he goes for the most part"
"Matisse Thybulle and Seth Curry  Or Thybulle and Shake  They aren’t MVP worthy, but locks for all stars I would imagine"
"I mean yeah he's hit well on his top 10 picks but I think he really flubbed the past two drafts.   Cap-wise he put the Celtics into a position with maxing Kemba that meant they couldn't make any real trades (no tradeable contracts for salary matching). If you have your core of Kemba/Smart/the Jays then he should've doubled down more on drafting older, ready-to-contribute guys like Payton Prichard.   He traded away both Matisse Thybulle and Desmond Bane, hard pills to swallow. Also Romeo Langford has bust potential written all over him; I would've taken Brandon Clarke in a heartbeat."
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/07/14/report-security-called-to-jimmy-butlers-hotel-room-because-of-workout-dribbling/amp/#aoh=16172558995788&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s  Even NBC makes a tongue in cheek reference to the fact that Jimmy loves to bring attention to himself, saying there's a non-zero chance that he called security himself. Either Jimmy is a completely unempathetic asshole or he was dribbling a basketball around his room to bring attention to the fact that he was working out. Even Matisse Thybulle had his workouts in his vlog and they didn't require loudly dribbling a basketball in his hotel room.   https://www.businessinsider.com/jimmy-butler-heat-practice-330-am-2019-10  It doesn't really matter how they started. The thing is that Butler always has to bring attention to how hard he works. Every rumor or story you have heard about Jimmy Butler in the past five years is spread by Jimmy Butler. There are other stories like how Rondo called him and Dwade out for trying to air team drama with rookies, his feud with KAT, him refusing to let Rubio talk to his old teammates, plenty of rumors of him beefing with Simmons and the staff of the 76ers except for Embiid. Dude comes off as disingenuous because he's always trying to get good media coverage of himself. He did the infamous Wolves practice and literally immediately did an interview with Rachel Nichols to try to make everyone else look bad and he continues to embellish details about it, even three years later. On the podcast with Reddick he talked about how he loved being with the 76ers and refused to sign with them that offseason."
"since the nets trade I'd say the only definite hit so far (only counting first rounders) was rozier, but rob williams III and payton pritchard look really promising. for grant williams it's probably too early to see but it looks bad so far. desmond bane and matisse thybulle look like steals but we traded them. and then james young, rj hunter, and yabu were misses. if i haven't missed any picks thats a 5-4 record of solid-to-good picks outside the lottery in round 1. as an extremely biased fan I'd say thats not too bad. would've loved if more than 2 of those 5 were actually on our team tho, thanks mr. daniel ray ainge"
the rockets could have ben simmons and matisse thybulle instead of fertitta’s pocket lint lol
"Holy shit, this article is so poorly written.  It's actually funny. While I can understand guys like Dray and Bam not making the top five while their teams wallow in mediocrity (I am looking at you though Pacers), the fact that the **next** five on their list hidden at the bottom are Matisse Thybulle, Fred VanVleet, Chris Paul, Jakob Poeltl, and Josh Hart leads me to believe whoever wrote this doesn't know a basketball from a hockey puck."
"Fertitta let his ego/pride get the best of him and he refused to deal with Morey. He's dumb. Could've had your ""big three"" for the next couple years consisting of Ben Simmons, John Wall, and Christian Wood. Could've also had Matisse Thybulle as well along with a couple of first round picks.  That man really could've had the perfect setup for a post Harden rebuild. He would have Simmons be his big ticket guy who got people to go to a Rockets game and to build the team around. Silas wouldn't have to suffer through a dreadful first season as a HC with nothing to work with and constant losses. The team would've had first round picks which the Rockets desperately needed. On top of all that I feel a roster with John Wall, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Christian Wood, Kevin Porter Jr, Kelly Olynyk, and DJ Augustin on it would've definitely been able to get the Rockets into a play-in game and possibly sneak into the playoffs. At the very least, it'd be a decent team going forward and you have SOMETHING to get Rockets fans on board with and excited about. Shit, chances are if the roster looked like that Demarcus Cousins and PJ Tucker possibly would've stayed for the rest of the season and helped the team out even more.  Bottomline man, don't let emotions and pettiness keep you from seeing the bigger picture. Fertitta could've had the Rockets hit the ground running once Harden was traded. Instead he let the team trip and fall flat on its face then skid along the ground into a 20 game losing streak and likely last place finish at the end of this season with not all that much to look forward to next season.  I just hate seeing any team completely fall apart due to a shitty owner. I've seen it too many times and wouldn't wish it on any team. Besides the Nets."
all you run is barclays center. trying to buy a ring and all just to stop matisse thybulle
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
&gt; Some Sixers fans act like 4 ppg matisse thybulle is untouchable. Most laker fans act like preseason superstar THT is untouchable. what's your point?  And they are all fucking clowns. What’s YOUR point?
"Some Sixers fans act like 4 ppg matisse thybulle is untouchable, what's your point?"
I def don’t wanna take from Thybulle because he’s a stud but it’s worth mentioning Philly’s size is extremely difficult for drive first guards to score against.   The homer in me is skeptical Fox would be defended as effectively by Matisse if he played on a team like Washington or Minnesota
Matisse Thybulle and Dort.
"&gt;Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.  And what were Philly ACTUALLY willing to give up?"
Young player who can contribute right now on the level of Matisse Thybulle/Terrance Mann/Donte DiVincenzo  Veteran with experience but can still be a very quality rotational player (Dwight Howard/Derrick Rose/PJ Tucker)  AT LEAST 2 1ST ROUND PICKS  1-2 2nds  Salary Fillers
"r/nbadiscussion is a joke. So many advanced stats without context, they think ts and RAPTOR are the only stats, and if you disagree you’re a biased hypocrite, even though most of them are. They need to take a step back and realize advanced stats aren’t everything. No, Matisse Thybulle is not better than Gary Payton at defense. No, Westbrook isn’t the worst player in the nba. No, Kuzma isn’t having his talents suppressed by playing next to lebron and Davis"
"Raptors were asking for “Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks.” according to Athletic.     So let's say you removed Maxey and Thybulle and even a 1st rounder, the Raptors should've done it. Green could've been flipped or even ride out the rest of the season since he's a free agent anyways.     Instead the team will walk away with absolutely nothing to show for Lowry staying with the team for the rest of the season."
"They focus too much on being a football school.   Also a lot of the talent gets recruited and divvied up amongst the powerhouse Pac 12 and to some extent the Mountain West programs. If you grow up in a talent rich SoCal there isnt one or two particular programs you choose from unlike Bama/Auburn, Texas/Texas A&amp;M, Ohio/Ohio St, or Michigan/Michigan St etc...Theres a ton of options. You can go to UCLA, Arizona, ASU, Stanford, San Diego State or other really good programs on the west coast.   Also because its so talent rich, if youre a lesser star recruit for instance playing in SoCal, you might either slip through the cracks or think of being the star of a nearby Pac 12/Mountain West program than being more of a role player for USC/UCLA. (ie Kawhi at SDSU, Tony Snell at New Mexico, Spencer Dinwiddie at Colorado, Klay at Washington State, Delon Wright at Utah, Matisse Thybulle at Washington"
PG: James Harden  SG: Kyrie Irving  SF: Matisse Thybulle  PF: Giannis  C: Embiid  This team would be extremely good lol
"Canada for sure, but Australia has had quite a few players come and go in the league.  Luc Longley on the MJ Bulls  Bogut Simmons  Patty Mills Joe Ingles Matthew Dellavadova Thon Maker  Aron Baynes  Shane Heal and Andrew Gaze are some Aussie basketball legends that managed to make it to the NBA in in the 90’s  Matisse Thybulle is American but I believe he is gunna play for Australia in the Olympics which is great cause he’s my favourite player."
"Steven Adams, Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle."
"Similarly, Matisse Thybulle is 204th in Minutes per game and 5th in Steals per game."
i'm taking Matisse Thybulle
"Yup, saying that Matisse Thybulle is a shit shooter who won't be able to play crunch time playoff minutes in a lineup with a total non-shooter in Ben Simmons sure is a ""dumbass thing""  Just admit that you're a salty homer who doesn't really know much and move on"
"Is it though?  - Danny Green is an expiring contract who didn’t re-sign with us the last time he was traded here  - Mike Scott is on a expiring contract and he’s averaging 4.4 points  - Matisse Thybulle is good defensively, but he’s averaging **3.7 points**  - Maxey looks nice at 20 averaging 7.7 points  Half of it looks like filler to me. I’m not necessarily opposed, but it’s not like the 76ers are giving up a ton either."
Furkan Korkmaz and Matisse Thybulle
Because it makes Matisse Thybulle look like prime Gary Payton.
"If Matisse Thybulle makes two threes a game, on anything fewer than ten attempts, he's the best 3&amp;D player in the league."
Matisse Thybulle
Matisse Thybulle
People been posting shit about Matisse online  call that Thybulle Libel
He got fleeced when the Sixers got Matisse Thybulle for Carsen Edwards and Ty Jerome
Perfect Thybulle game. If we trade Lowry I’ll be sad to see him to go but excited if we could get Matisse.
"Matisse ""Steph Curry"" Thybulle."
"Let's go through our bench.  Dwight Howard: Very solid backup Center in limited minutes. Strong on D, okay on O with quite a few dumb mistakes. Count on 8 points, 12 boards and 4 Fouls (with 2 of them being Offensive)  Shake Milton: Supposedly our 6th man. Started season very hot, hurt his ankle and has not been able to hit the broad side of a barn since. Always been a streaky player, but this is exceedingly cold. Had a nice bounce back later in the game, but still a bad shooting game.  Furkan Korkmaz: The most divisive player on the bench. He's just as likely to go off for 25 points and 6 3s as he is to turn it over 6 times in 8 minutes. Goes ungodly cold and nuclear hot at random, but also likes to play like he's Lebron for some reason. Liability on D, but active enough that he can sometimes cheese a steal.  Matisse Thybulle: Legitimately one of the best defenders in the NBA, but is having a horrendous offensive season. Shooting something like 35/25/60. Gets plenty of play because he's good for 3+ steals in 12 minutes, but really bogs down the offense.  The rest of the bench are all pretty much scrubs or rookies that will not see play in the playoffs."
https://twitter.com/KevinMcC973/status/1363555930483400706  &gt; Zach LaVine shot 2-16 (16.7%) when guarded by Matisse Thybulle on Friday night.  interested to see this matchup again
Matisse Thybulle and PJ Washington
"Smart, rozier, brown, and Tatum went 6, 16, 3, 3. Since the Tatum draft, their first round picks have been:  2018: Robert Williams, 26th  2019: Romeo Langford, 14th. Matisse Thybulle, 20th (traded to philly). Grant Williams, 22nd.   2020: Aaron Nesmith, 14th. Payton Pritchard, 26th. Desmond Bane, 30th (traded to Memphis)  So basically your whole point was just trying to say that when you draft in the lottery, it’s easier to have good picks than when you draft in the teens and twenties lol. Hard hitting analysis buddy, thank you."
"Nah, Matisse Thybulle is very good but he’s not up to Ben’s level yet."
Matisse Thybulle gotta be at least All-Defensive 2nd Team
"Give me Matisse Thybulle baby, he’d steal the ball from MJ twice, bounce it off his head, and smile for the camera"
Y'all really traded the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle for Carsen fucking Edwards lmao
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
"Skill boost - Ben Simmons, 3pt shooting. Improves spacing and makes Ben Simmons ball handler pick and rolls so much more effective. Since Ben is already a good passer, he'd be pretty dangerous.  Honorable mention - Embiid, playmaking. Embiid is already extremely hard to guard, but if his playmaking was better he'd be laughably unstoppable.   Athleticism boost - Shake Milton. Shake has average athleticism I'd say. He's already able to drive well because of his craftiness and his length. Extra athleticism would probably make him a starting tier player as it would improve his scoring and turn his defense up a notch.   Height boost - Matisse Thybulle. Imagine have two Ben Simmons running around on defense lol. He'd still be shorter than Ben at 6'8"" but still. Honorable mentions - Seth Curry, being taller he'd get his shot off easier. Maxey, would probably immediately take over Shake's role with added height."

Matisse Thybulle &lt;3
Pretty sure you’re describing Matisse Thybulle here
Matisse Thybulle with the 5-2-2-3-4 statline and team-high +24 in 20 minutes He's gonna be a legit 5x5 threat every night once he starts playing longer minutes.
Matisse Thybulle or Ben Simmons?
Lmk when they all mention Ben Simmons &amp; Matisse Thybulle bro.
MATISSE THYBULLE FIRST TEAM DPOY
remember Philly could have had Mikal shutting down the whole baseline and bench airspace along with Matisse Thybulle
no ones gonna win dpoy playing 18-20 mins like matisse.  He probably wont even make defensive all 2nd team for the same reason but it might be close.  Simmons is not overshadowing Matisse at all it is shining a light on him.  ben literally said this week Thybulle would probably win if he got more minutes lol
"Matisse is obviously the better defender, but we shouldn’t act like Caruso is all too bad. Call me crazy but I think with more minutes he’d be a little under a border line all defensive guy. Plus Thybulle looks incredibly lost when he has the ball on the offensive end unless he’s shooting it. Not to say Caruso is anything special on that end, but he at least has some control of it. I think overall, Thybulle, but varies from team to team"
"Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle"
#MATISSE THYBULLE
"No onnis saying they’re unbeatable but when you compare this team to last year or even the year they took the raptors to seven games, needing 4 bounces to lose, this is probably the most complete they have ever looked.   They have a top tier coach in Doc Rivers, Joel is playing as the mvp, you got some of the best shooters around him and Ben with Seth and Danny 3 rings, Doc proved he’s the Tobias whisperer by reviving that man. Then you get to the sixers bench which is anchored by Dwight Howard proving LA made a mistake, Korkmaz blooming into the deep threat, George Hill providing leadership, then Matisse Thybulle being the best defender in the nba on less minutes.   Am i saying that they are a lock? No anything can happen in playoffs, but if the sixers can get the right seed, there’s no reason they cant make the ecf and beyond."
"We're just gonna have to agree to disagree here. You're not going to change my mind that a team in 7th gets two all-defense selections. Especially a team that looks like they're going from a finals appearance to the play-on. I'm not saying Jimmy doesn't deserve the selection, I just don't see the voters giving it to him. Jrue should have at least 3-4 selections, but he only has one and that was the year they made the playoffs while he was healthy. I get what you're saying about the all-star game but thats a popularity contest, and its not even the same voters for all-defense.   Yeah Jimmy has played 13 fewer games, but he's played almost 100 more minutes. Thybulle has played almost 400 fewer minutes than Jimmy but is only behind him by 4. Matisse is probably going to be playing closer to 25-30 minutes a night the rest of the season so I can see him passing Jimmy."
Lmao it’s definitely more concerning to be arguing that Matisse Thybulle can defend Kyrie at 4 am  He can’t btw
About how the Nets will walk to the finals. You moved it from that all the way to me saying who can guard Kyrie? You’re just trying to argue about anything to defend the 76ers lmao   Matisse Thybulle cannot guard Kyrie Irving...at all.
"I didn’t, because for the third time it has nothing to do with the argument pertaining to Matisse Thybulle.   I could name 100 players, not only would you argue about all of them, but it wouldn’t change anything about whether or not Thybulle could. Do you not see why I haven’t answered that question? Your trying to move the goalposts of the argument just like you’ve done a few times already. This is the most laughable argument I’ve ever had on Reddit."
"No you weren’t, you were just trying to move the goalposts of the argument once again. You relinquished small points but still stood pat on the integrity of your debate. “Yeah we don’t have Butler but we’re better”, etc. That’s a disingenuous point, you’re definitely biased.   I hate Kyrie much more than any team, you can play the biased angle all you want but it’s a little hypocritical from the guy claiming Matisse Thybulle can guard Kyrie Irving. He can’t and he’d get embarrassed."
"Let me break this down for you even further, since you still don’t understand it.   Matisse Thybulle cannot guard Kyrie Irving and in a playoff series Kyrie will have his way with him. You replied to my claim with “so nobody can guard him???”   Lol no, I said Matisse Thybulle can’t guard him. Now, you’re trying to deflect that point by saying “well who can guard him then” as if Thybulle is the best defender in the league and if he can’t nobody can lmao. I could name 100 players and I’m sure you’ll nitpick and argue each one, I’m all set on that. Matisse Thybulle can’t defend Kyrie and that’s all that matters pertaining to *this* conversation. You did misrepresent my point, you’ve done it a few times. That’s not even debatable.   I don’t want to argue about this at all actually. It’s 3:47 AM and I have a biased 76ers fan who’s been arguing every single point I’ve made that wasn’t pro 76ers for hours to the point where he’s trying to convince me Matisse Thybulle can slow down Kyrie Irving in a playoff series lmfao."
"It is strawmanning. You misrepresented my point by saying since Thybulle can’t defend him, nobody can. Which is wild within itself. Literally textbook strawman.   Saying Matisse Thybulle won’t be able to defend Kyrie in the playoffs does not mean I should have a list of players who can. What type of flawed logic/mental gymnastics is that? Lmfao"
"I didn’t say he was, as shown by me saying   &gt;”No, Matisse Thybulle can’t guard Kyrie...**or harden, or KD lmao**  Kyrie will abuse Thybulle in a playoff series."
"No, Matisse Thybulle can’t guard Kyrie...or harden, or KD lmao. They will all abuse him. The only guy who can make a difference is Ben and he can only defend one of the 3."
"We will. It is disrespectful though. Matisse Thybulle will get abused by Kyrie in a playoff series. I know he’s your guy, but you’ll just have to see it when it happens lmao."

"Strange memories in this weird and unexpected thread on Reddit.  Twelve years later? Thirteen? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. An /r/nba thread about Matisse Thybulle is a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it means something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive on that pointless post on Reddit and on the Internet.

We all tank for guys who could one day be Matisse Thybulle.
"I mean at the time it looked pretty good tbh. This post is lying to fit a narrative because the trade was the 24th pick (Grant Williams) and 33rd pick (Carsen Edwards) for 20th pick (Matisse Thybulle). So getting almost a late first to move back 4 picks late in the first round is a pretty solid move in my opinion. Obviously didn't work out though with Carsen barely playing and Grant not working out as well as expected, while Matisse is a good rotation player on a good team."
I would argue Embiid should take the spot (2nd Banana to Matisse Thybulle)
"This season, eight Australian-born players have played an NBA game.  - Ben Simmons  - Patty Mills  - Will Magnay  - Kyrie Irving  - Joe Ingles  - Josh Green  - Dante Exum  - Matthew Dellavedova  Irving does not represent Australia internationally, whereas Aron Baynes (born in New Zealand) and Matisse Thybulle (born in the US) do.  Ryan Broekhoff, Jonah Bolden, Mitch Creek and Isaac Humphries are all playing overseas but have spent time on NBA rosters in recent seasons. Josh Giddey is also a projected first round pick in this coming draft. I’m not sure where the number four comes from?"
They're both lucky that Matisse Thybulle doesn't play more minutes because if he did he'd be running away with the DPOY award!
"Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell, Matisse Thybulle, Dario Saric, Joel Embiid"
I will always be a fan of whatever team Matisse Thybulle and Markelle Fultz are on. They played for my university and I got to meet and talk to them personally. Kelle only a little bit but I was genuinely a friendly acquaintance with Matisse. I’m like 30% sure if he saw me right now he would recognize me. Also whatever team KD is on is a team I’ll like.
"If Matisse Thybulle is lucky just maybe his ceiling can be Thanasis with more control but less athleticism, just maybe though."
"Surprised Matisse didn’t get T’d up for waving off Brothers, a disgusting act by Thybulle"
How is Thybulle over OG lol. OG is the blueprint that Matisse is trying to follow rn
"Ugly game from both teams honestly, Suns looked tired. Book this week has been hounded by Jrue Holiday, Matisse Thybulle and then Marcus Smart. Thankfully he’ll get a rest when playing Brooklyn since they have no one who can guard him lol"
"They can but the DPOY talks out of Philly are getting out of hand.   * Embiid has been a DPOY for 3-4 years (fair enough, he should be in the convo)  * RoCo was a DPOY  * Simmons is currently a DPOY  * Thybulle could be a DPOY  Every team hypes their guys, but no one gets hyped to that degree.   Philly's defence is fantastic and you clearly have defensive talent, but it's not Prime Rudy + Prime Kawhi + Prime Draymond good.     Imagine if Dame started telling people CJ was an MVP calibre player. Saying Matisse is All-D would be hyping him up, saying DPOY is jokes."
He had dumb fouls in his first year but he’s been getting better at seeing his matchup’s strengths and weaknesses. He doesn’t go for pump fakes as much and tries his best to keep his matchup in front.   Defenders who allow the lowest shooting percentage in the NBA:  Matisse Thybulle - 38.0% Ben Simmons - 41.7% Rudy Gobert - 42.8%  Thybulle is also:  1st in defensive +/- 1st in steal % 1st in deflections 3rd in defensive rating 9th in total steals 186th in minutes per game
The only criticism I have of Matisse (besides his inconsistent/nonexistent offensive game) is the small fouls he commits every now and then. But as you said both Sixers coaches in the past 2 years have trusted Thybulle to guard some of the best competition in the league and he has delivered great results. Watching the Ben Simmons and Thybulle lead 2 - 3 zone defense earlier this season was a thing of beauty.
Danny Green says Matisse Thybulle is a young Kawhi confirmed
"&gt;passes a much different eye test than Kyrie did  And that's a very valid point and kind of what I was trying to show.    Defensive stats in general are very goofy. Brad Stevens: *""When I get an e-mail that has defensive metrics in it, I delete it.""*   Advanced stats like DRTG really don't show much of anything besides the team is good.   Raw stats like steals/blocks/rebounds don't show enough of the picture to actually declare a player is even good defensively.  * Steph Curry has led the league in steals  * Hassan Whiteside had led the league in blocks  * Andre Drummond has led the league in rebounds  I'm not saying Matisse is bad (he's obviously a very good defender), but DPOY is such a high bar to clear. Jrue Holiday, Marcus Smart and Chris Paul have never even cracked top 5 in votes. As an undersized defender with limited team-wide impact, Matisse has no real chance at DPOY.  Plus DPOY is a term we see thrown about by Philly fans.   * Embiid is a DPOY candidate (although he actually is) * Covington was a DPOY candidate * Simmons is a DPOY candidate * Thybulle will be a DPOY candidate  You can't just label everyone a DPOY candidate."
No offence but Matisse is already 24 and looks like he is gonna be Tony Allen on defence with worse offence. Even prime Tony Allen was not a great asset at all and Thybulle will probably have worse offence
"I might get downvoted for this, but Matisse Thybulle might be the best perimeter defender I've ever seen play. Just some remarkable shit."

"I think he has; how many guys taken after Garland would you take over him? The only ones with a case are Coby White, Rui Hachimura, Cam Johnson, PJ Washington, Tyler Herro, Chuma Okeke, Nickeil Alexander Walker, Matisse Thybulle, Brandon Clarke, and Lu Dort. I'd personally take Garland over all those guys except maybe Dort."

"I don't think a package of Herro, Duncan and Achiuwa, would have gotten it done for the Rockets without significant draft compensation. That was the big issue with the sixers package too. The Rockets still screwed up by only getting Oladipo. I would have rather had Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and picks, or Caris LeVert, Jarret Allen and picks then Oladipo."
"hot take, Matisse Thybulle is the best perimeter defender since GP and its not close"
"As a husky fan I can add to this - the huskies were coming off a surprising NCAA tournament appearance the season prior and despite losing Matisse Thybulle among others from that team, they were bringing in arguably their greatest freshman class ever highlighted by Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels, and expectations were high.  They ended up having no chemistry whatsoever the whole season and while Isaiah Stewart put up numbers (he was first team freshman all Pac 12) the huskies finished 5-13 in the conference.  Despite averaging 17 and 8 as a freshman, I think there was a realization amongst scouts that he probably wasn’t gonna be the type of mercurial talent to carry a college let alone nba level team to success as the best player, which I would honestly agree with.  What he can be though is an extremely valuable part of an nba roster that could easily start on a playoff caliber team."

"Yeah it really does lol, this is the kinda thing someone who hasn't watched what large point guards on the peremiter can do would think, watch a few minutes of matisse thybulle and you will see what a massive advantage length is for guarding the peremiter. It CAN hurt your team when you don't have the size to really bother shots, especially against large point gaurds with high and quick releases. I like facu and he did a great job on steph recently because his specific physical disadvantages can't be punished as much there, he is good, but again, matchup dependant. If he was as good against everyone as you say he would have gotten more playing time guarding the other teams best shot creator on the peremiter, but the nuggets almost always get someone else to do that if that person is on the floor."

"tyrese maxey, matisse thybulle, ben simmons, and multiple first round picks is pretty ridiculous compared to what they ended up getting."
"Thybulle is going to be such a key in series against the Nets. You're going to pretty much need to keep Ben on Harden and Durant pretty much at all times. If Matisse can stay out of foul trouble, and keep his 3 consistent, he's going to get starter minutes against them."
"In hindsight I should've went into more detail than just saying Thybulle. I think he gets heavy minutes against Kyrie, and is his primary defender, but that doesn't mean he is starting or that he will always be out there with Simmons.   Honestly a lot of it will come down to how the Nets do their rotations, how Matisse is shooting, and if Matisse can avoid foul trouble."
"Lebron (25.5), AD (22.5), Chris Paul (16), Royce O’Neal (6.8), and Matisse Thybulle (3.9) = 74.7  I was thinking of Bam possibly too instead of CP3, still not sure."
"Okay, because of Ben’s limited offensive production, I think the Blazers should target Matisse Thybulle instead, he may not be on the table but he would help them a lot and hit his free throws  Thybulle and Seth Curry for CJ?"

The Matisse Thybulle game.
"You have a good point about Embiid still playing but let's be clear, DeAndre Hunter and Joel Embiid aren't the same impact. Hunter is much closer to say, Matisse Thybulle. Embiid being limited is a much bigger impact than Hunter not playing at all.  But, to be clear, that doesn't take anything away from the Hawks' two wins or make the rest of the series mean any less. They are playing great. Some teams are always more banged up than others this time of year. It's life. No one takes anything from the Raptors in 2019 or the Warriors in 2015 because multiple opponents were not 100%."
Lebron should be in over Matisse. He was the best player on the #1 defense. Even with the games missed he played a more important role for their defense than Thybulle in 20mpg.
"We still doing this? Clearly Adam Silver loves the Sixers and tries to help them out whenever he can. They are literally cheating for the Sixers. Idk why that doesn't extend to Tobias Harris though, who goes to the line about the same amount as Matisse Thybulle."
Cellar Door. That’s the only word in the English dictionary more beautiful than Matisse Thybulle.
Is Matisse Thybulle the cutest player in the league?
"Thybulle guards the best scoring threat when Ben is out or if a he has to guard a bigger man. Ask Suns fans about what Thybulle done to Booker (although they won). He doesn’t guard bench scrubs 24/7.   About Bridges, I love the guy but Thybulle has him beat. Check the stats. Thybulle's defensive fg% was 38.2% to Bridges' 48.4%. dbpm 4.3 to 0.8. 0.1 more blocks and 0.3 more steals per game. 2.7 dws to 2.6.  Maybe Bridges over Kawhi, but Matisse has earned this. And regardless it’s irrelevant now, he’s second team all defense."
Thybulle deserves 1st team tbh  I completely understand other teams fans not getting it yet but Thybulle is as generational a defender as Luka or Zion are as players. He literally fundamentally plays defense differently (and usually better) than anybody in the league. He has the block/steal numbers of a defensive-minded veteran starter in 15-20mpg. Matisse is gonna be a legendary defender in this league  (I expect/don’t mind downvotes for this take but feel free to press me and I’ll elaborate. I could take about him all day)

Do you have a moment to talk about our future Defensive Player of the Year Matisse Thybulle?
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Matisse Thybulle. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Tisse. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
"Dude you are literally comparing them in this comment right now. You’re using Bertans’ contract as a baseline for what Thybulle might get.   My point is that Bertans is a sniper, Thybulle will never be even close to as good a shooter as him. And Matisse is miles ahead of Bertans defensively.   They are entirely different players and teams will value them accordingly. Given how much shooters get paid (and defensive specialists don’t) I don’t see Thybulle getting anywhere near Bertans money unless he develops a 40%+ 3 pointer."
"I don’t see the Bertans comparison at all. He is a stretch 4 with no defense, basically polar opposite to Thybulle.   If Matisse could shoot the rock like Bertans does he’s a borderline max player. More realistically if he can hit something like 36% on 5 attempts I see him as a valuable piece for any playoff team in the future."
"No way he makes only 5 mil a year. Draymond has almost zero offensive impact on a bad team but his defensive presence alone would justify starter money.  Matisse Thybulle got extended playing time this year as a non factor on offense because his defense was that good. Considering draymond is a big, where offense is less valuable and defense is more valuable than for perimeter players, he’d probably still pull 12-15m a year."

"There are quite a few Seattle area guys in the league.  George Karl helped create the high level AAU scene in the early 90s, and the area has been creating NBA guys regularly ever since.  Murray, Zach Lavine, Avery Bradley, Kevin Porter, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden McDaniels."
exactly.... sad... Matisse Thybulle will never win 6th Man because he is not a scorer but his defense is game changing
"CJ and Dame can work out if the other players on the team are great defense player like Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green, and healthy Anthony Davis protect paint with help defense. They would also need a wings who can defend like Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby."
All I know is that Jrue Holiday and Matisse Thybulle absolutely erase Booker
"Sixers defensive matchups vs. Trae Young:  -Game 1- Danny Green: 49 plays Matisse Thybulle: 14 Ben Simmons: 8  -Game 2- Simmons: 31 plays Thybulle: 29 Green: 2   Trae has scored:  21 points on Green (6-10 FG, 7-7 FT),  20 points on Thybulle (6-12 FG, 6-7 FT), and  4 points on Simmons (2-6 FG, 0-0 FT)."
Romeo Langford to me is like a slightly worse on defense Matisse Thybulle to most Sixers fans.
"&gt;Only issue is, the Hawks have a bunch of dudes that can hit from range.  Matisse Thybulle has entered the chat."
"To piggyback off this, Australia (if all their players show) has a really solid rotation. Ben Simmons, Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes, and Dante Exum is a solid group of NBA players. They also have other notables like Mitch Creek, Ryan Broekhoff, Thon Maker."
"I cheer for Matisse Thybulle because he is a black version of me. His face looks exactly like mine, for real"
"I'd still take Australia over them.   Ben Simmons with 3 40% 3 point shooters in Patty Mills, Joe Ingles and Ryan Broekhoff and a big that can hit an open shot in Baynes/Maker/Landale is a great starting 5. Not star-studded, but as a team they fit together so well.   Then they can bring Matisse Thybulle, Exum, Delly, Josh Green, Giddey off the bench.   They're just a smart, well balanced team, there's no teething problems with trying to fit high usage players together, they just have a bunch of solid role players that can defend, shoot and facilitate at a high level."
"i definitely agree that thybulle is our best bet on trae, and i expect to see more of it, but the problem is that matisse only plays half as many minutes as trae. for the time we have to have someone else on him, i think most sixers fans would prefer it to be simmons just because green got smoked a bit last game"
"i think we’re all pretty blinded by the thybulle foul on trae that was pretty clearly a push off and went to replay and was still a foul on matisse somehow  other than that i thought the refs were very ok… usually in the playoffs there’s less whistles as well so that contributes to people being mad.   it’s not the reason we lost, we lost because we sucked for 2 quarters so i don’t get all the complaints"
"I'm not convinced Grant is the best player in the deal. His usage was higher than CJs and his efficiency was lower, and he put up less WS. Generally, it looks like the advanced offensive stats favor CJ. While yes, there is context I don't see his game fitting that well with Dame's either and it's hard for me to feel too high on a guy that led a team to 20-52 in the east.  I don't think he's a lateral move as a player, and the benefit of his better contract is more relevant if you're losing Dame and looking for future deals. Plumlee is a positive but has never been able to play 30 mpg and I would rather ride with Nurkic. For Portland this is the kind of trade that just doesn't bring enough in to take on the risk. It reminds me of Utah going after Al Jefferson when they lost Boozer.  I think Thybulle will be the best player in this hypothetical when all is said and done, and that's who I want if I'm Portland. If I'm Philly I'm fine with giving up Maxey but not giving up Matisse especially for an overpaid one way guy."
"I feel this Sixers team is just softer than it was when Jimmy Butler was there. They did compensate offensively, but they're worse on defense and down the stretch. Nonetheless, I am picking Philly in 6 (maybe even 5). I'm sure that Doc will adjust and throw Matisse Thybulle and Ben Simmons at Trae Young."
"yeah CJ's value gets underrated (maybe not by a lot, but by some margin) due to his defensive deficiencies and some playoff no-shows. But he's still a very good player with a modern skillset and it's no coincidence he's been part of top-tier offenses with Portland. He's a guard who can create his own shot and shoots 9 threes a game at 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? In a league where shooting efficiency is more important than ever, that's still valuable, even if it comes in a package that's not built to be a defender. Peep the advanced stats - they still paint CJ as a very solid, positive player (and not as bad on defense as fans make him out to be). The problem is that he may not fit well next to Dame.  A few trade targets I see:  * Jimmy Butler — would require many additional assets and is 100% contingent on whether the Heat want to pay Butler a massive contract. Very likely they will. Jimmy would be a great complement to Dame as a secondary ball handler and defender, but CJ's volume 3pt shooting would be missed. * Jerami Grant — would require some additional assets and contingent on Detroit looking to flip a player they for value. Grant is still somewhat unproven. He turned into an offensive creator in Detorit and after a hot start saw his efficiency dip, as well as his defense. But he has solid size, a varied skillset, and generates 6+ FTAs, something Portland lacks outside Dame. Blazers could bet on him taking another step by becoming more effecient as a second option. * Tobias Harris + Matisse Thybulle — 76er fans will probably instantly nix the inclusion of Thybulle. That's fair. But it could be a very attractive package for Portland, and would be worth additional assets to bring in a complementary scorer and versatile defender. A third team may need to get involved to provide value to Philly. * Kristaps Porzingis + Josh Richardson — call me crazy, but I think KP has become a distressed asset whose potential is actually underrated. The Mavs let Luka go full Harden-ball, leaving his teammates standing like statues beyond the arc. (That's fine, Luka's good enough to justify that). But skilled bigs require more creativity to use and the Mavs showed no interest in getting KP involved through DHOs (something Portland loves), elbow face ups (where KP's height can really shine) or screening actions (another Blazer fave). This move is a big gamble, but Portland has kept its powder dry for years. Time to take a swing. If it misses, it means Dame time has run out. But that window is closing anyway."
"Thybulle then needs to sub for Simmons or Harris, which he should anyway to stagger another *star with Embiid.   Embiid, Harris, Green, Thybulle, Curry is fine and could easily check in at 8min in the 1st and then keep Matisse on Trae as Simmons rotates in for Harris or Embiid. Korkmaz for Curry. Etc.    Theres better substitutions than we saw today"
Thybulle played 7 minutes in the first half and only one and a half of them were with Trae in the court. The whole point of having Matisse is to have him guard the best player. He should play 20-30 minutes per game and only when Trae is on the court. Danny and Ben can take turns guarding him the other 10-15 minutes.
"My bad, proper defending position is running as fast as you can away from Trae Young. I've heard Matisse Thybulle can almost make it out of the arena in a full 24 second shot clock"
Oh look Matisse Thybulle with good defense on Young.
"People clowning Danny Green but I don’t think there’s a defender out there who can guard Trae Young. He’s too quick and clever off the dribble for Ben Simmons/Matisse Thybulle.  Get too close to him and it’s a foul, give him a little bit of space and he can splash a 3 ball or he’ll get into the paint and lob one up to Capela."
Doc Rivers really just tried to put Danny Green on Trae for an entire half when we have Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle.
Doc Rivers really thinks his sixers can outscore the hawks.  Matisse Thybulle should be guarding Young
doc going all bench counting on matisse thybulle threes
"I said it in the Hawks gdt but we're gonna fight over screens on Seth Curry and double Embiid and make Matisse thybulle, Ben Simmons, and Danny green beat us if we can"
"I swear to god Matisse Thybulle is the most overrated defender in the league   I was told he could shut down Kyrie, but trae young is putting him in hell LMAOOOO"
Trae gonna learn that Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle is a lot different than Reggie Bullock
"Ben Simmons, 3 firsts and two swaps OR (and I would hate this version), Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle."

"Idk that's what Celtics fans say about deals that don't fall through, at some point you realize it's posturing from the front office to make them look better. Probably the same case for the Sixers as well.   Most people were reporting that you guys didn't want to include Maxey in the trade, which is crazy. And it looks like Tilman valued having more picks compared to players. If you guys had thrown in more picks I think Harden would be in Philly.   &gt;Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle were even informed by their agents on Wednesday of a potential trade, according to sources. A league source said the Sixers were going to send Simmons and Thybulle to the Houston Rockets in exchange for the three-time scoring champion. Houston also asked for Tyrese Maxey and draft picks, according to sources. However, a source close to the Sixers denied that Maxey was part of the deal."
"Probably not. We have 3 or 4 guys on our bench who are better or equal to him in how they impact the game. (Dwight Howard, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, George Hill). I might trade Korkmaz for him (though that’s close because I REALLY like Furkan) I would trade Shake Milton for him with no hesitation."
1. Joel Embiid: No 2. Ben Simmons: No 3. Tobias Harris: No 4. Seth Curry: No 5. Danny Green: No 6. George Hill: No 7. Dwight Howard: No 8. Matisse Thybulle: No 9. Furkan Korkmaz: No 10. Tyrese Maxey: No 11. Shake Milton: Yes?
Matisse Thybulle Homer Answer: THT
Matisse Thybulle will avenge us.
Who needs Matisse thybulle when u can have grant Williams and Carson edwards
Tyrese Maxey is the Matisse Thybulle of the 2020 draft.
That Grant Williams for Matisse Thybulle trade always interests me   I genuinely don’t know who is better
&gt; Matisse Thybulle starts for Joel Embiid. Sixers going small with Ben Simmons at center.  &gt; Could certainly see some zone and/or a lot of switching with that group.[&gt;](https://twitter.com/rich_hofmann/status/1400220110397263874?s=20)  Curious about that.
"He's not having a 40 point game against Ben Simmons, Danny Green and Matisse Thybulle in the playoffs 💀  Last game 2 of his 3 shots were made jump shots, with the other 1 being a putback off a missed 3.   So if he still struggles to finish at the rim this game as well, it's going to depend on his jumpshot. Basically how long will it take him to realize his jumper is broken 😭😭😭😭"
Defensive specialist. Matisse Thybulle
"Matisse Thybulle, has the potential to be an all-time great defender"
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
"Your perception of Ben being a bad offensive player is just wrong. He's not Matisse Thybulle. Just because he doesn't score a ton doesn't mean he's not having a huge positive impact on the offensive end. Ben obviously can't be the best player on a championship team, but how many players really can be? You have to have an absolutely stacked team to even compete in the NBA because of pickup teams like Brooklyn and the Lebron team.   The Sixers have an MVP caliber player in Embiid, a scorer in Harris, and shooters in Curry and Green. Simmons as a facilitator, lockdown defender, and ability to drive to the rim is an ideal fit on an already loaded team, which is the only kind of team that can compete anyway. Scorers are far more common and less valuable, any team would be better for having Ben Simmons on it.   Casual fans are just the majority of fans who watch and follow the sport but aren't super hardcore nerds about it. It's not an insult or a bad thing, it's just that on reddit every casual fan thinks too highly of their own opinion."
"Thybulle is a much worse offensive player than Ben, and a pretty comparable defensive player. There is no universe in which it would make sense for Doc to sub Thybulle for Ben when down late in a game. Matisse is also shooting 44% from the line this year (admittedly on low volume), so it’s even worse than Ben by a huge margin."

This is the Matisse Thybulle Robin Lopez shootout we were all expecting
Whichever team has Matisse Thybulle
I wonder how Tatum would fair playing like that with Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle plying defense
Matisse Thybulle
#1 is Matisse Thybulle.
We got Thybulle though. Normally I’d agree with you but this kid is magical on defense. He’ll get burned a few times cuz Harden and Kyrie are good but Matisse should be able to do some damage.
I said “Ben Simmons doesn’t produce enough”?  Or I said “Matisse thybulle needs to shoot to provide value in his current form” and “Ben Simmons has flaws in his offensive game”  Big guy
"A decent amount. Mainly tuned in to watch Poku.  Thybulle was a good shooter in college, shot over 36% on 3 attempts his rookie year, and then Daryl Morey loaded the team with shooters and Matisses offensive role was reduced.  I think the two are much closer in the jump shot department then people think. They just look at Dort at 34% on high volume this year, and Matisse 30% on only 2 attempts.  Thats not really fair imo. If Matisse was on the thunder hed be getting 37 minutes a night, and the opportunity to get into a shooting rythm."
"Almost all your comments in that thread are trash man. I get you think Dort is better, that's a perfectly fine opinion but all your reasoning and support is garbage. Youre accusing everyone of not watching the games and all you have to say in your defense is box score numbers. Also, making a separate thread to try to goad people into agreeing with you is just some of the most pathetic shit ive ever seen  &gt;You literally have to be crazy to think a 24 year old with no improvements to there game while having 30/44 shooting splits has a higher ceiling.  &gt;The dude leg.it sucks ass.   &gt;Lu Dort would start on contending teams and immediately raise there floor.   &gt;I don’t even wanna answer this if you actually think Matisse is in the same convo as Dort.   &gt;Thybulle sucks."
"And soon to be, Matisse thybulle :)"
Matisse Thybulle (I’m from the future)
"I want to say “Matisse Thybulle and Ben Simmons are the defenders we think Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to be” . But I’ll wait. Even though Beal is a tough, I’ll wait till they meet a tougher team opponent..  ...matter of fact let me just go tweet it.  Forget what you just saw!"
"&gt; “He’s very similar to Ben (Simmons),"" Beal explained. ""He’s tall, has long arms, he’s physical and is a willing defender. I think that’s what separates a lot of guys in the league. He takes pride in defending. He doesn’t care about what happens on offense, if he’s involved, or gets shots. His job is to keep me from doing what I do, and I respect that.""  &gt; ""(Matisse Thybulle) goes out and competes at a high level,"" Beal continued. ""To see he’s only in his second year, to be a willing defender as he is that’s a good sign. His trajectory can only go up, but I definitely try to make it as tough on him as possible -- make him work and try to move him.”"
"Lol nah I actually had Thybulle on my fantasy team and I loved him cause he’s such a beast for defensive stats. I just get cynical about these cherry picked stats. I mean the thread is called “Matisse Thybull Makes Playoff History” when it’s literally a stat that no one will think or care about once the next big performance comes along. Amazing performance from Thybull, but let’s not get carried away here."
It's official: Matisse Thybulle is a Hall of Famer  wrap it up folks
"Matisse ""ZA WARUDO"" Thybulle"
Matisse Thybulle
"&gt; Your downside is you've got another Matisse Thybulle on your hands that you just burned a Top 5 pick on.  2019 redraft, where does Thybulle go? Top 3 are pretty obviously Zion, Morant and Garland imo, but after that it gets a lot shakier. I'm not saying anyone should take Thybulle over RJ Barrett, but he's got a pretty strong case to go over Jaxson Hayes."
Yeah they are Matisse Thybulle
"Yeah - he is basically a 3&amp;D wing who can't shoot yet.    Your upside is he figures out how to shoot one day and rolls all that athleticism into being the next Jaylen Brown in a few years.  Your downside is you've got another Matisse Thybulle on your hands that you just burned a Top 5 pick on.  Problem is it gets dicey quick after 4.  Some of these guys will hit of course, but good luck guessing right.  So at that point, if Kuminga has the highest ceiling, well, maybe he is the right call at #5."
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
"Jrue is more impactful because 35 minutes of impact is better than 20.  But on a per-minute or per-possession basis, I think Matisse is solidly the most destructive defensive guard in the league and the closest thing we've seen to 2013-16 Kawhi. Jrue, Simmons, Butler and Dort are all terrific too, and it really is splitting hairs. But watching Thybulle defend is quite literally a joy, he's got this wild ability to bait even top scorers into going exactly where he wants, to ""recover"" and hit them from an angle they were never expecting."

"Pistons are championship contenders  Thunder trade picks for an All-Star   Jaylen Brown somehow leaves Boston  Anthony Edwards becomes a top 10 player   AD retired earlier than expected to injuries   Vegas has their own basketball club, and is one of the most successful franchises in the NBA  Chris Paul is a coach   James Wiseman is one of the best centers in the league   Matisse Thybulle is the best defender we've seen in years   Wizards have a core with Avdija, Hachimura, and Gafford   LeBron has a front office position   Cade Cunningham doesn't live up to his potential  THT is an All-Star"
"Portland would probably want one of Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle and a pick, Philly would probably want a pick. The problem is Philky can’t take the contract of Lowry and CJ at the same time, so you could do  Dame + first round pick swap 2023-&gt; Toronto  Lowry + Gary Trent Jr + Toronto’s 1st rounder from 2022-&gt; Philly  Ben Simmons + Tyrese Maxey + Philly first rounder 2023 -&gt; Portland"

"Matisse thybulle, all defensive second team in his sophomore year. Absoulte pest on off ball, help and perimeter defence"
"I'd say that Line applies to the Matisse Thybulle's and Andre Robersons of the league, not guys like Jrue or Draymond. Thybulle is an all-nba defender who can't consistently stay on the court for more than 20 minutes because of how little he provides on offense. Jrue, even on his off nights, provides playmaking, generally takes care of the ball, can penetrate and put pressure on the defense, and teams can't just ignore him on the perimeter to double his teammates. Sure he has his cold nights when he can look bad but even on those days he provides more on offense than a guy like Thybulle and pairing that with his defense is enough to make sure that his offense is never bad enough to offset his defense.  Jrue would basically need to lose his handles overnight and become a Giannis level perimeter shooter for his offense to be bad enough to cancel out the defensive impact  he brings."
"I heard somebody say this earlier,  and the only person I could think of is maaaaaaybe Matisse Thybulle, but I definitely wouldn't bet on it.  Maybe someone from history, like Hakeem, or LeBron in his prime, but definitely nobody else playing now."
"Completely agree. It's also interesting because during the pandemic, Seattle was highlighted for semi-uniquely having the collectivist European mindset despite being in the United States. You could reasonably stretch that down to the Bay, I know SF did a really good job too, and if you look at the reputations of players from Seattle/Portland/the Bay, it tracks.  Klay grew up in Portland and played for Wazzu, unselfish and very mellow. Dame, Oakland, unselfish and very mellow. Zach Lavine, very unselfish and mellow, Matisse Thybulle, the Lopez twins spent a couple of years up here and then the rest in Fresno but close enough; basically every guy in the League from the Land of Hella is a notoriously well liked and unselfish teammate, with Spencer Hawes and Kevin Love basically being the only two exceptions, throughout 30+ guys. And Kevin Love, there's an argument that a lot of it was him having the classic PNW introversion, that may have made things more difficult for him.  If you want to get into MLB, Blake Snell also has this same reputation of being super mellow and a little weird, as does Timmy Lincecum. Really fascinating."
"Blowout three way trade:   Sixers get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Andrew Wiggins  * Eric Paschall  Warriors get:   * Myles Turner  * Domantas Sabonis  * Caris LeVert  Pacers get:   * Ben Simmons  * James Wiseman  * Matisse Thybulle  * 7th overall, 14th overall from the Warriors  * 28 overall from the Sixers  * 2023, 2025 1sts from Warriors  * 2023 1st from Sixers   * Filler to balance the money (Smailagic, Mulder)  So:   Warriors effectively give up Wiggins, Wiseman, Paschall, Mulder, Smailagic, 7, 14, 2023 1st, 2025 1st for Turner, Sabonis, LeVert. LeVert slides in to SF as a 20ppg scorer, Turner is a big upgrade at C, and Sabonis ends up being sixth man of the year as a backup PF/C who'd play 36 a night. Have two of Dray/Sabonis/Turner out there at any one time. Lots of spacing from a Curry/Klay/LeVert first unit. Just need to sign 1-2 vet guards.  Sixers give up Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, 28 overall, 2023 1st for Andrew Wiggins, Malcolm Brogdon, and Eric Paschall. Not sexy, but they trade young assets for win now players that improve the team. Brogdon becomes the starting PG and Wiggins becomes the starting SF. Each brings 20ppg, floor spacing, rebounding, ball movement, and plus defense. Paschall becomes a young, cheap, usable bench big.  Brogdon/Curry/Wiggins/Harris/Embiid with Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Danny Green, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Eric Paschall is better than their team this year. Sign a vet PF and a vet C and you're in contention more than ever during Embiid's absolute prime.    Pacers reset by giving up Turner, Sabonis, Brogdon, LeVert for Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, 7th overall, 14th overall, 28th overall, 2 2023 1sts, and a 2025 1st. (Mulder and Smailagic balance the money and would presumably be cut). This is probably the most controversial part of this trade. But they get a prebuilt young core of Simmons, Wiseman, Thybulle, and Brissett, plus the 7th, 13th, 14th, 28th, 54th, and 60th picks this year, as well as three future 1sts. That's an absolute war chest that they can use to rebuild overnight from the ground up.   So, the Warriors and Sixers both improve their rosters to contend immediately, and the Pacers flip their underwhelming core for a bunch of young players and high value assets. (Including that 2025 Warriors 1st, which is likely a lottery pick, since Steph, Klay, and Dray will be really old by then). This could set up the Pacers to really improve down the line. Maybe they package assets to move up in the draft. Maybe they keep the picks, draft a bunch of prospects, and tank for a year to develop them and get a high pick in next year's draft.   To me, all teams benefit here."
"Matisse is more of a sure thing, and also more rare. Maxey has a higher ceiling imo but I'd still take Thybulle if I could only pick one"

Lol Matisse Thybulle does this all the time with jump shooters and still get called for the foul. It’s insane

"You can't force guys to play and a few top guys are still in the playoffs.  That said, not to discount how far the rest of the world has come, but I feel like whichever team wins the NBA finals any given year could beat any team in the world. You don't need to just build an all star team. This is bigger than an exhibition. Gimme like 3 or 4 star players and a the rest of the roster can just be quality role players that can adapt to the international game.  Like Matisse Thybulle and Marcus Smart should low key have spots on this team if we're actually trying to win a gold."

"I wanna respond for fun  1. Simmons wouldn't have been as much of a disaster with Lowry. Lowry would've taken playmaking duty, stretched the floor to open up lanes for Embiid and Simmons, and reduced the need to play defensive liability Seth Curry or offensive liability Matisse Thybulle. What I'm saying is that the tanking of Simmons' trade value you just saw this playoffs is greater than anything you would've paid for Lowry.  2. What are the better long term options? The value in Lowry is that you don't have to give up Simmons. Lowry for picks and bench prospects is more net value than something like Beal for Simmons."
"Since Siakam seems to be on the table for the right deal, how would this look for all involved?   Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Malik Beasley  Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Ricky Rubio  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Some number of Sixers 1sts (1-4). Maybe two of them?   Sixers get a star wing who can score plus a microwave 20ppg scoring guard.   Timberwolves turn their backup guards and a young prospect into Ben Simmons, who fills all the holes in their starting lineup. DLo/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a damn solid core.   Raptors flip Pascal for a haul - a great prospect (McDaniels), two good prospects Thybulle, Maxey), a veteran PG who can replace Lowry or come off the bench (Rubio), and some pick(s) from the Sixers."

"Cavs/76ers/Blazers. Ive posted this in other subs, but want to know what the general fan thinks...  76ers get: Lillard, Covington  Blazers get: Simmons, Sexton, 76ers 28th pick, 76ers swap 2024, Cavs 2nd rounder, 76ers top 5 protected 2026  Cavs get: Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle, Portland lottery protected pick (any year).   This is assuming Cavs want to move on from Sexton, they get a decent young Guard to fill that role immediately. They also get a raw top NBA defender in Tisse (they need defensive help). Blazers get Simmons/Sexton, an all-star, and potential young future all-star along with a nice hunk of picks, they could then decide to move CJ for whatever... 76ers get the missing piece to a Finals run and Covington back where he belongs."
"A couple of guys they missed out on:  Matisse Thybulle  Brandon Clarke  Darius Bazley  Terrance Mann  Talen Horton-Tucker  Obviously everything is in hindsight, but it's a bit interesting going back and seeing what players teams missed out on later in the draft."
"It’s one of those basketball possessions/games that without a doubt will define a player for the rest of their lives.  We remember Hakeem for his shake on DRob, Shaq’s dunk on Dudley, John Starks bricking everything Game 7, Kerr’s 3 point shot in the finals and so forth. Nothing encapsulates the failure of Ben Simmons more than that single pass to offensive juggernaut Matisse Thybulle."
Very bias pick but Matisse Thybulle always throws down some nice looking dunks
Ya but would you rather have a championship or Matisse Thybulle
"I’m confused, why did okongwu dunk that instead of passing it to a friving matisse thybulle?"
"Patty Mills and Jingles will always be held higher than Bogut in my eyes. Gaze and Longley are aight.   Matisse Thybulle though, he the low-key dark horse fan fave"
Cam Johnson and Matisse Thybulle have a similar look going on. Like youthful and innocent
"Pretty pissed. We've never won, or even placed (top 3), at the Olympics and FIBA WC in basketball, and theres large population of us who love the sport. In my biased opinion, we've had the 2nd best team talent wise in the world in the last 5 years, 50% of our team plays in the NBA which ranks very highly outside the US national side. And then Ben Simmons, the most ever hyped Australian player, wants EVERYONE to know hes Australian in all his interviews, yet keeps deciding not to play for us? FFS even Matisse Thybulle wants to play for us and noone knew he was Australian."
"Would this lead to teams tanking or fighting to get a specific playoff spot in the hopes of nabbing that player they want at the end of round one? You raise a good point about the Hawks only ending up with Rose/Randle.   One of the things that gets missed in thought experiments like this - fun as they may be - is how to incorporate a new player into your defensive and offensive schemes quickly so as to not disrupt what helped you win the last series. But it's really tough to pass up the prospects have having a top 5 or 10 player in the league added to your roster.  Jazz v Grizz (1 v 8) - Take Ja Morant   Suns v Lakers (2 v 7) - Take Lebron (pray he holds up or doesn't end up brawling with Crowder in practice)   Nuggets v Blaze (3 v 6) - Take Dame   Clippers v Mavs (4 v 5) - Take Luka  Sixers v Wiz (1 v 8) - take Beal   Nets v Cs (2 v 7) - take Tatum   Bucks v Heat (3 v 6) - This is so bloody tough. Don't want Butler because he can't shoot. Don't want Bam even though his D is great - he can't shoot or create for himself. I can't believe I'm saying this - Duncan Robinson   Hawks v Knicks (4 v 5) - Take Rose (6th man, keep in Trae's ear)  Jazz v Clippers - Closer but the Clips prevail. Take    Suns v Nuggets - Nuggets take Devin Booker from the Suns in a close series - yes, I'm aware the Suns have Lebron. It becomes too many cooks in the kitchen with Dame, Joker, and Lebron. Save yourself the headache and take the hot hand.  Sixers v Hawks - I think the funk of the Process can't be solved by Bradley Beal. Hawks. Take Matisse Thybulle for his sick defense and not needing to run a lot of plays for him.   Nets v Bucks - Nets win with two guns. Take the Freak.  Nuggets v Clippers - Nuggets rip the Clips. Take Rondo to put in as your closer, 2nd team general. Keep your Playoff P away from me!  Nets v Hawks - I think this series would be really close. But I think the Nets prevail. Take Giannis.  Nuggets v Nets - Close series. But I think the Nuggets would squeak this one out. Do they get to take KD for game one of the 2021-22 season?"
"Damian Lillard, Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid   George Hill, Shake Milton, Reggie Bullock/Doug McDermott/Patty Mills, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard   They could end up with something like this if they can make it Maxey and not Thybulle."
"Simmons, Maxey, 3 FRP and 2 pick Swaps would be both a good haul for Portland and a big improvement for the sixers.   Dame/thybulle/Green/Tobias/Embiid is a real contender. I think that without Ben, Matisse will be more featured, as his eh shooting doesn’t hurt as much without Simmons around. I think that would offset some of the possible defensive regression from losing Simmons, and Dame + Embiid is a guaranteed top 5 offense."
"We’ll give you fourth quarter Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle on offense and Shake Milton."
"&gt;Dame is out. Enjoy watching Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle and Shake Milton the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Ben Simmons: “For instance, people say, 'Ben you should dunk!' But if I can get  Matisse Thybulle the ball for a f---ing layup, why would I dunk?”  ***FTFY***"
"&gt;	Why should I even dunk?  “For instance, people say, ‘Ben you should dunk it!’ But if I can get Matisse Thybulle the ball for a contested 1 on 2 f—ing shot, why would I dunk it?”"
"While I sort of agree, I don't get why we Re pretending Trae wasn't being defended by Ben Simmons and Matisse thybulle for 6.5 out of 7 games last series.   It's like the only thing I can give Doc props for during the whole series, is that he did a great job keeping one of them out on the floor in am effort to have Trae covered. I wish he had been defended by Curry more."
"Lol. The NBA is literally changing the way they officiate because of the ridiculous calls Trae gets. I guess you need to read up on current events.  We had Allen Iverson for over a decade. We got similar calls but they changed the rules to accomodate.  Case and point, Game One of Sixers Hawks. Matisse Thybulle gets called for a foul while running stride for stride with Trae, Trae lowers his shoulder initiates contact and Matisse is called for a foul. That happened all series.  But I get the rose colored spectacles you're viewing Trae through. Personally, I think it's a travesty when a guard gets to the line 10+ times while shooting horribly, which is basically the story of Sixer Hawks."
"I think Bev will stay on Book, he seems to bother him more than anyone else in the NBA aside from Gary Harris/Matisse Thybulle"
"Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle  Thunder receive: Kevin Love, 2023 top-8 protected FRP from Cleveland  76ers receive: Kemba Walker, Collin Sexton"
"How much of a ""haul"" do you think prime Andre Roberson would've netted?    Or how about Matisse Thybulle?    One-way perimeter defenders who force a team to play 4-on-5 offense in the playoffs aren't worth a ton, especially when they cost $150M for four years."
"I always say Trae's best asset is his iq. If you asked him why he turned it around mid rookie season it wasn't cause he just got better, once he played each team once he understood their schemes and how they guarded him.  Matisse Thybulle played the best defense I've seen anyone play on him and it took 1 game to adjust."
"lmao TIL the Australian national basketball team's mascot is the [Boomers](https://australia.basketball/blog/2021/02/03/australian-mens-basketball-olympic-squad-revealed/).    &gt;Currently ranked #3 in the world, the Boomers will head into Tokyo looking to claim their first ever Olympic Games basketball medal and will do so under the tutelage of Brian Goorjian, who will this year attend his third Olympics as Boomers Head Coach.  I also didn't realize how many NBA players were Aussies.  Joe Ingles, Patty Mills, Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Bynes.  Should be interesting to see how they fare against the US team."
"The biggest thing is that their defensive stoppers are actual two way players. Holiday has a versatile offensive skill set with being one of the best guard defenders in the league. If we have to start Solo to try and slow down Giannis, he gets to play Free Safety on defense, PJ Tucker can hit 3s and body Gallo, Brook Lopez can take either Collins or Capela out of the paint or bang down low on the low block.   Matisse Thybulle and Ben Simmons are great defenders, but they aren’t offering you anything on the other end of the court"
Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle is just as good a duo as Jrue and Middleton. Better according to the all nba defensive team voters
"They could actually update this to him passing to fellow Aussie, Matisse Thybulle lmao"
Matisse Thybulle stock 📈
Jordan Poole will be the best offensive player. Matisse Thybulle best defender.
"If they do that trade, wouldn’t it make sense to start Matisse thybulle at shooting guard and make Seth the 6th man? With Matisse and Danny green at the wings spot and Embiid in the paint that defence should still be good."
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, Shake Milton, Tyrese Maxey, plus picks for Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons and Zach Collins. Who says no if Dame demands a trade?"
"It's all the worse too because it's Matisse Thybulle, an amazing defender, but not a scorer himself (44%FT, 42%FG) but at  least he's not a coward."
"Underrated point, is Lowry really going to want to play for the guy who said he isn’t worth Tyrese Maxey and Matisse Thybulle?"
"The Atlantic was reporting ""Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, Danny Green, and two first-round picks"", which was just too much."
"Because as bad as he was, there was a 2 minute stretch in game 3 to open the 2nd half where Simmons just took the game over and the Hawks pretty much never came back from that. Everyone still believed he was capable of it (physically he still is) but we didn’t know he’d completely break. There’s a difference in deferring to Seth Curry and deferring to Matisse Thybulle"
Matisse Thybulle has a 7 foot wingspan lol you can put him on any wing or guard  Also Danny Green and even Korkmaz aren't bad

"How are all of Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey, and 1st round picks ""extremely replaceable""   Masai basically asked for every asset we had for a 35 year old. Morey rightly walked away. Morey said the asking price was in La-La land, and that was proven true by the fact that no one ended up dealing for Lowry at all  We didn't need Lowry to win this series we just needed DG healthy"
Pass to offensive juggernaut Matisse Thybulle
PG: Monte Morris/Jalen Brunson  SG: Shake Milton  SF: Matisse Thybulle/Jalen McDaniels  PF: OG Anunoby/George's Niang  C: Pascal Siakam/Reggie Perry  We don't get draft picks
Why take free layup when the King himself will dunk past the double team  from outside the paint. Simmons just recognizes the true easymoneysniper that is Matisse Thybulle.
"are you serious lmao. let's ignore ben, 6ers top players are the mvp runnernup joel embiid, a pure scorer in tobias harris, flamethrower seth curry, all nba defender matisse thybulle, a veteran george hill, shake milton and a pretty good rookie imo tyrese. you wanna do a side by side against the hawks' best players?  even by your argument that the hawks are at the nare minimum very close to philly, philly got outcoached"
Thats Matisse 'Shaq' Thybulle to you
Pass to offensive juggernaut Matisse Thybulle
And the offensive powerhouse he passed to was Matisse Thybulle.
Ben refusing to attempt a wide open dunk and instead passing it to a contested Matisse Thybulle was probably the saddest thing I’ve ever seen
Even fucking Matisse Thybulle was confident enough to take a three. But Simmons is too scared of a wide open dunk
Matisse thybulle not being able to Guard Kevin huerter is why the 6ers Lose
"Matisse Thybulle should play corner for the Eagles, tbh"
"For me it’s Suns because Monty is an amazing human being and deserves it, and I just want CP3 to finally get a ring. After that, it’s the Hawks because I love Capela and would enjoy seeing r/NBA go crazy over Trae winning in just his third year, because this sub seems to hate him so much. After that, it’s the Sixers because they’re not the Bucks and because I have a crush on Matisse Thybulle. Then, it’s the Bucks because they’re not the Clippers. After them it’s the Clippers, because someone’s gotta win, I guess. Lol."
Guys like Joe Harris perplex me so much and get me mad   Like you ONLY have ONE job   You’re not asked to do too much beyond just catch and shoot   And yet.......  This isn’t like asking a Matisse Thybulle to consistently hit 3s   This a guy that won the 3 point contest in the past
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
"Wow, TIL the Sixers have 3 of the top 4 defensive RAPTORs this postseason:  (1)  George Hill.  (3). Matisse Thybulle    (4) Joel Embiid."
Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle can't win with these cats
Matisse Thybulle rn is like the happy and optimistic dog in a broken marriage
ok would you rather have a championship or bet on Thybulle being good in a few years? bc Lowry gets you wayyyyy closer to the chip than Matisse
Classic good offensive players Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle
"Thats not what you offered thats what masai wanted.   ""The Philadelphia 76ers are interested in acquiring Kyle Lowry, but there is a limit to how much they will offer the Toronto Raptors in a potential deal.  ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported on First Take (h/t Kyle Neubeck of Philly Voice) the Sixers won't package Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle and draft picks together for Lowry.  Windhorst noted that the Raptors want all of those pieces, which include first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, to send Lowry to Philadelphia."""
He's basically Matisse Thybulle with a worse FT% and 15x the salary
If Matisse Thybulle plays 20 seasons and hardly ever gets injured then he's one I could see getting close.  Obviously it's not going to happen.
"I just went into our sub by new and literally the first post was a hypothetical saying Dame for Ben, Maxey, Matisse, 2023 1st, 2027 1st, and 2 FRPs.  Almost every single Simmons for Dame trade I've seen on our sub includes at LEAST 2 of Maxey, Thybulle, and Milton, as well as at least 2 FRPs. If not they generally are downvoted or called out for being idiotic. But hey, you know our sub better than the actual people reading and posting in it daily, so let's defer to you to let us know what we think."
"The likely scenario would probably be:  Lillard, Malik Beasley and Pat Bev to the Sixers    Simmons to Minnesota   2022 unprotected FRP (Sota)   2022 top 3 protected FRP (Sixers)   2023 Pick swap (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected FRP (Sota)   2024 top 5 protected pick (Sixers)   Tyrese Maxey   Paul Reed   Matisse Thybulle   Jaden Springer   Naz Reid    To the Blazers. Four firsts, a swap and four young talented cheap players (albeit no potential super stars).  They then trade McCollum for another good first or two decent firsts and start over."

"Sorry it wasn’t meant as a diss toward Trae, but if you have Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle on your team I expect a better defensive performance"
Al Jefferson - post moves   Matisse Thybulle - blocking jump shots from behind   DeAndre Jordan - catching lobs   Manute Bol - blocking shots without jumping   Tristan Thompson - offensive rebounding

I'm not sure how this team would ever score, but I think they could win one defensive slugfest against a bad team where they just hold them to like 80 and get a bunch of transition buckets"
Steph Curry / Andrew Wiggins / Gordon Hayward / Pascal Siakam / Brook Lopez  Matisse Thybulle
"Thank god you've got Ben Simmons anchoring your defense with such notable liabilities as *Danny Green*, *Tobias Harris*, *Matisse Thybulle*, and horrible defensive center *Joel Embiid*. Without Simmons those guys would be lost on the defensive end."
"&gt;None of my links stated that.  ""Toronto's asking price has been accordingly high: as ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported earlier Thursday, the Raptors have asked for multiple first-round picks and young players, including Philadelphia's Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey, in order to deal their franchise legend to his hometown.""  \-- [https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  Furthermore, the original point of the thread was that Lowry was not worth Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and a first -- which you argued for a couple days.  &gt;Miami isn’t paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don’t have to,  Well, yeah they are, since Lowry's ask was [$25 x 2.](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-eyeing-kyle-lowry-two-year-deal-nba-free-agency)  Even Lowry didn't think he was worth this contract, and it's not as though adding more AARP-eligible years adds value to the team.  In all likelihood, this contract will be among the league's worst by next season -- as we repeatedly see with expensive deals for players in their mid-to-late thirties.  &gt;especially considering how that deal essentially puts them at the salary cap, and especially because \~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry’s asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year.  Again, you don't pay more for adding years that late in a career.  &gt;I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it’s actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.   35 year old Dragic is not better than Caldwell-Pope -- which is why Dragic has not been an NBA starter in four years -- and his play dropped off significantly last year, and his health is unknown.  If they were the same age, that would be true, but Caldwell-Pope is seven years younger.  Dragic also has a worse contract.  &gt;Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.  Achiuwa is an extremely raw 20th pick, which makes him unlikely to be anything but a replacement-level player.  There's obviously a chance he's more, but it's slight.  &gt; It is also better than no return.  If Dragic is healthy and can play.  &gt;They’ve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived.  Kendrick Nunn is a point guard, and played 30 minutes per game for the Heat in both the preceding two seasons.  They also had Vincent for both of those seasons, and he even played 13 minutes per last year.  So, no."
It’s fucked!  At least Matisse Thybulle actually lived in Australia.  Tobey didn’t even know what a Slovenia was!

Matisse Thybulle is on the verge of finding his shot. He looks more confident day by day.
"Nah, the Simmons slander has gone too far. He was the best all-round defensive player in the league for the first 40 games of last season, before his personal life imploded. Thybulle is a great defender, and as an Aussie I love the guy, but Simmons length, size and athleticism put him a cut above Matisse defensively."
That’s Matisse Thybulle not Tyrese Maxey my guy but the names are similar and it’s an understandable err
"1. Kyrie Irving is the most offensively talented player in league history. His offense is so good people sleep on his defense. He is actually a great defender. 2. James Harden is supremely overrated his jumper is inconsistent af but i think he plays way better defense than he gets credit for 3. Draymond has been the best overall defender in the league for years but has regressed so much on offense he may as well be matisse thybulle  4. The Lakers roster is awesome i loved every move...shame they couldn't get Rudy gay tho 5. The bucks don't get passed the second round next year and the sun's getting bounced in the first 6. The Cavs are going to compete for a play in spot next year 7. Bol bol is being under used and under developed under Mike malone 8. Phil jackson is the most overrated coach of all time in any sport 9.  Hakeem is the ""best"" center of all time regardless of rings 10. Larry bird would be joe ingles in today's game"
"Just when she thinks you're about to put it in, you yeet her at Matisse Thybulle?"
"Three-way trade is more likely. Who's the loser here:  Sixers get:   * Dame Lillard  Blazers get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Harrison Barnes  * Matisse Thybulle  * 3 Sixers 1sts  Kings get:   * Ben Simmons  * CJ McCollum  * Tyrese Maxey   Sixers get their all nba PG to pair with Embiid. Lillard/Curry/Green/Harris/Embiid is filthy. Easy yes to go all in  Blazers actually improve, in my opinion. Fox/Norm/Barnes/RoCo/Nurk plus Thybulle as a young stud off the bench, plus future picks, is pretty damn good and isn't a three-undersized-guards lineup  Kings get players to make the playoffs with. Davion/Haliburton/McCollum/Simmons/Holmes with Maxey, Buddy, Bagley, TT off the bench is a playoff team  Point is, I think there's something here."
Danny green. With Matisse thybulle being the future once he works out his shooting some more. Future dpoy potential.
"Maxey, Matisse, and late 1sts isn't what they would/should want though.  Thybulle is a great role player for a contender but not somebody to build around. Maxey's ceiling is debatable, but either way, what you're proposing would make him the best asset in this offer and that's not enough."
well matisse thybulle is the best perimeter defender in the NBA
so matisse thybulle wouldn't be signed by teams?
Matisse Thybulle
Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle
"Matisse Thybulle ""He's a thief, but that's legal in Philly"""
There are college players who’s defense easily translates to being elite in the nba. Ex. Matisse Thybulle. Kawhi was another.
"The Phoenix Metro area isn't exactly a basketball Mecca, so this is the best team I can build -   PG: Jerryd Bayless   SG: Matisse Thybulle  SF: Kevin Knox?  PF: Marvin Bagley  C: Alan ""Big Sauce"" Williams  As bad as this team is it would have been a whole lot worse 5 years ago."
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
"I think he's still coming to grips with the Aussie culture. One day you're just a player on the 76ers, next minute, you're Matisse Thybulle Minister for Defence, receiver of free drinks for life.  Homeboy probably doesn't know how much of a splash he's made here at home."
He looks like an evil version of matisse thybulle
Matisse Thybulle.
Idk if it'd be enough to qualify for MIP bit Matisse Thybulle is one solid 3 point shot away from being among the very best roleplayers in the league
Matisse thybulle gonna have a dpoy season with these rule changes
Also Matisse Thybulle just became a better NBA defender.
"Since it's really really difficult to judge defense I often rely on advanced stats. Obviously for me watching game is still the best way to judge something, but stats nowadays are extremely good.

Matisse thybulle isnt much of a driving threat either  He’s routinely left wide open  A player is left open if they’re a bad shooter period.  A bad shooter shooting a wide shot is quite literally low %. That’s what makes them a bad shooter.
"Positions with PG/SG tend to be unclear, especially with defensive minded players so I just tried to fit in who I felt was the best guard defenders.  PG: Ben Simmons, Jrue Holiday, Kris Dunn, Dejounte Murray, Fred Van Vleet  SG: Marcus Smart, Paul George, Dillon Brooks, Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort  SF: Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, OG Anunoby, Lebron James  PF: Draymond Green, Giannis, Anthony Davis, Pascal Siakam, Robert Covington  C: Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela, Myles Turner"
Rui Hachimura to win MIP. You heard it here first.  As for someone from another team? Matisse Thybulle to win DPOY.
"His bubble youtube videos were cute and he had a solid defensive season but he's super overrated by Philly fans. Nobody else really cares about Thybulle or cares if their team plays against Thybulle or really want to trade for Thybulle, as promising young wing talent he's shown so far he needs to have like 6-8 more seasons of consistency to start this kind of talk. No coach is going ""oh man Matisse is in town, we need to focus the gameplan around him"""
Just ordered a Thybulle Sixers jersey.  My next cat’s gonna be named Matisse.
"Yeah, I think it’s one of those things that people don’t realize is not okay, and they don’t realize the harm it does, because it’s so subtle to them. I think a lot of people, when you explain it to them, they would stop.  Just like when it was super common for someone to say “that’s gay” when they meant “that’s dumb.”  Also, sometimes I’m really just trying to objectify some damn fine players, and it just ruins it for me when someone comes in with a joke like that. Like, c’mon let me be a bro and talk about how hot Matisse Thybulle is, r/NBA. Lol."
Matisse Thybulle develops a reliable 3 point shot and ends the season a starter.
"“Matisse Thybulle with consecutive career highs this week! Huge leap for the young wing, Philly must be thrilled. He’s averaging 12 ppg across 3 games this week.”"
How the hell is this a race joke? This is not.   Matisse Thybulle isn’t white but he is handsome.   Curry and Tony Parker aren’t white but they are handsome men.   Wtf is wrong with you bringing race here lmao
"As a longtime basketball fan, I have no issue with Ben sitting out the games.  There is no doubt he is an asset. Or that he closed out the NBA season in the wrong headspace.  If he comes back having worked on what is needed (shooting and resilience), he will be the better for it.  The next Olympics are only 3 years away.   The notable standout was Matisse Thybulle, already had eyes on him from watching Ben in Philly. Really looking forward to seeing his developments over the coming years"
Matisse ‘The Great Barrier Thief’ Thybulle
Kira Lewis for Matisse Thybulle both sides say no
"Everytime Australia played ""Matisse"" and ""Thybulle"" were in the top 10 trending for Twitter in Australia. He has become very popular in Australia during this Olympics"
"Matisse Thybulle is a defensive tyrant, he's a budget-priced Ben Simmons but just as effective and ten times more likeable (and patriotic).  I will follow Thybulle's career far more closely after his efforts over the course of the Olympic tournament; he was crucial."
Aussie legend Matisse Thybulle
Matisse Thybulle
I applaud the AUS front office to make a bold Ben Simmons for Matisse Thybulle trade but its worked out well
Matisse Thybulle is your favourite players' favourite player.
Matisse Thybulle put an absolute exclamation mark on the show with the dunk at the end there. And Patty Mills take a bow lad that was a cracking performance
Matisse Rimmer Thybulle
"Matisse Thybulle. I love looking at his statline. For 20 MPG, him averaging 4/2/1/2/1 is quite amazing."
"I am going to publically admit that trading away Matisse Thybulle was one of the worst fucking moves of Danny’s career.   I tried to see the silver lining in that, but trading an Aussie and for a pick and then using that pick to dump another Aussie was very fucking upsetting."
MATISSE FUCKING THYBULLE
Paddy mills  Joe Ingles  Matisse Thybulle  That new kid   Here are some aussie names to pay more attension to instead of this flog.
"If this was about any other player it would have never even been posted. People legit hate Ben Simmons so they'll believe anything that makes him look bad or feeds into their preconceived notions about him.   This has just allowed so many people to call him a baby, a whiner, etc. So let me get this straight, no one else knows anything about what this dude is ""reporting"" including local guys like Bodner, Nuebeck, and even Pompey, but this guy knows. So he must be getting his info from Klutch or Ben. And Rich Paul, in his infinite wisdom, decides it would be in his client's best interest that the NBA world knew that Ben is a ""socialite"" who will pick where he's going based on the nightlife or whatever the hell.   Again, the organization that is so damn leaky that they couldn't even keep quiet about the fact that they wanted Matisse Thybulle long enough to draft him without him being held hostage by the Celtics, somehow kept everyone unaware of the fact that *Ben Simmons* has not spoken to *anyone* from the Sixers since the season ended. *Ben Simmons*, the same player who has drawn just a little bit of interest this off-season, has not spoken to the team and nobody local or national knows. Only this one random dude from California.   Good news Sixers fans, this is the same guy that said Damian Lillard was requesting a trade ""tomorrow"" and he's got it on good authority that Philly and New York are his top two choices. So we're good either way I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️."
You are not mistaken. Fultz played on a Washington team that included Matisse Thybulle. They went 9-22 (2-16 in the Pac-12). With that record they weren't even invited to the NIT.
"Higher on: Monte Morris (top 5 PG in the league potential), Matisse Thybulle (future DPOY if he gets minutes), Nikola Vucevic (literally a 25/10 guy), Melo (too many bad takes of people thinking he's trash due to efficiency)  Lower on: Deandre Ayton (he's good, but people were acting like he was in the Embiid/Jokic tier during the playoffs), Draymond (he's become Dennis Rodman tier offensively), and then for younger guys, Lonzo went from underrated to overrated again, and Siakam had one breakout season and has looked otherwise eh."
"Kevin ""Juancho ""Matisse Thybulle"" Hernangomez"" Durant"
"Everyone's talking about the lack of timeout in the 3rd, but the real question imo is why we thought we could get away with having Nick Kay as the primary defender on KD while Matisse sits on the bench.  KD probably comes away with it anyway but you can NOT afford to take shortcuts against team USA, and especially KD. They can take any momentum you give them and turn it into their elite shooters (e.g. the whole team) bombing threes on you the whole quarter. Honestly thought we'd try to match minutes between thybulle and KD as much as possible coming into this game??  &amp;#x200B;  Still proud of our squad though, it was always a hard ask but some real headscratchers during that 3rd quarter."
No more Matisse Thybulle vlogs let’s go 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Matisse Thybulle would be a good candidate for the 10 steals and/or blocks.
"Matisse Thybulle played almost perfect defense on KD, but KD is KD."
how many of yall knew Matisse Thybulle was Australian before 1 month ago?
Would a lineup of Steph / Tony Allen / Andre Roberson / Matisse Thybulle / Shaq be above average offensively?
Elbows Matisse Thybulle… and Drummond was never seen again.
"The no.1 seed who was in game 7 of the conference semis pretty much bring everybody back is far from a disaster. Hopefully maxey and thybulle improve. Simmons is a wild card.   Against the bulls. Simmons kills derozan, embiid dominates vuc in the paint, maybe vuc gets him away from the rim a bit with his shooting, Matisse on lavine. I think it’s really not a good match up for Chicago."
"He is a dual citizen but moved back to the States when he was 2. Matisse Thybulle actually lived here longer, though he wasn't born in Aus. He is also a dual citizen."
"None of us want Simmons on the team anyway.  Culturally we're very team oriented when it comes to sports (project thanks to cricket and AFL being our 2 biggest sports) so if he's not willing to show up for the national team, then he's not wanted.  Conversely, Matisse Thybulle has fit the team like a glove."
"A guy like Matisse Thybulle or Andre Roberson is useless on offense. Absolutely no stretch of the definition of the word makes it apply to a guy who can hit 3s on above average percentage and keep the ball moving/not be a liability catching it.   If he were a player signed for his offense, it would be rough. As a defensive stopper and second stringer on a team loaded with offense, he's more than competent on that side of the ball.   Saying he's useless there is just the kind of mindless hyperbole that this sub loves."
"Josh Giddey, Dyson Daniels, Josh Green and Matisse Thybulle are going to be leading the team in 3 years time."
"Great win tonight; the Boomers have historically underachieved but have barely put a foot wrong in Tokyo and have given themselves an opportunity to secure their first international medal.   The defensive effort against Argentina was immense.  Matisse Thybulle has been brilliant to date, an absolute defensive menace.  Loved Patty Mills as usual, what a leader he has been in Tokyo."
always good to see Matisse Thybulle put an entire country in its place
Matisse Thybulle is a sexy beast
"Fun fact, through 3 Olympics games Matisse Thybulle has averaged 3.3 steals in 20.1 minutes per game, or 5.67 per 36."
Watch as much Matisse Thybulle as possible.
"**Block A:** Start Harden, Bench Luka, Cut Dame  This is a toss-up and ultimately a win-win situation no matter what.    **Block B:** Start Kyle Anderson, Bench Matisse Thybulle, Cut Robert Covington  I think Anderson is easier to fit into any starting lineup due to his range of skills. Matisse's lack of offense/spacing makes it tough + he's been good off the bench. RoCo is too hot/cold.     **Block C**: Start Cade, Bench Mobley, Cut Jalen Green  Ignoring potential, right now Cade is the most pro-ready. And Mobley's mix of length, athleticism, playmaking, touch, and defense should allow him to adapt quicker than Green."
Til matisse Thybulle is australian
"Pretty good post, but I question your judgement when you say that Matisse Thybulle is not truly an all defensive player."
Ben Simmons is a star. Matisse Thybulle is a young role player. The weight of their mistakes is different.
Matisse Thybulle
"He is currently my favorite player in the entire league. Love his attitude, his ability to communicate his feelings and thought process, and most of all how he seems like just a genuinely great person.  My list goes:  1. Matisse Thybulle  2. Jaylen Brown  3. Lebron James  4. Larry Nance Jr.  5. Jamal Murray"
"Ben Simmons was 2nd in DPOY voting, finished 1st team all defensive and has made multiple all star games. Tobias Harris was considered a snub for the all star game this past year. Matisse Thybulle was 2nd team all defensive last season. Danny Green and Seth Curry are above average role players/starters. To say that Embiid was surrounded by ""a gang of useless scrubs"" is absurd."
"After Ben Simmons eventually turns into Aussie Curry and wins the game at the buzzer on a turnaround 3 Against Matisse Thybulle, i think we can finally take this sub to the back of the shed."
"Boucher played a large portion of his minutes last season at center, and if he isn't starting then that's even worse. Achiuwa and Birch are nowhere near starting caliber players, I really don't even like them as bench players for a decent team.  OG is a great 3&amp;D player, he is just overrated by Raps fans as of recent. I'd place him in the lower end of the top guys of that mold: DeAndre Hunter, Mikal Bridges, Dillon Brooks, P.J. Tucker, Matisse Thybulle, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Dorian Finney-Smith. In no particular order.  From the summer league games I watched reminded me of Patrick Williams and an early Kawhi, and his draft comp was a combination of Kawhi and Jabari Parker so I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say they are completely different.  But I guess I'm a fool for not thinking Toronto is going to have no issue being in contention for the playoffs."
"So I was looking into this a few weeks ago myself, and it turns out there are still two untied threads that started with the trade, at least on the Celtics' side.   In November of 2020, the Celtics were part of a three team trade with the blazers and grizzlies that sent Desmond bane to Memphis and enes Kanter to Portland, giving the Celtics two second round picks, one in 2023 and one in 2025. These are the last two threads. The Cs were only able to make this trade due to getting the rights to draft Desmond Bane in 2019 through a trade that sent Ty Jerome (and Aron Baynes) to the Suns. Ty Jerome (or at least his eventual draft rights, some of the available info is hard to track) was only able to be traded to the Suns due to the Celtics trading away the draft rights to Matisse Thybulle. They only had Thybulle's draft rights due to a trade with the grizzlies that sent Deyonta Davis and Rade Zagorac to Memphis. Zagorac came to the Celtics through the trading away of Brandon Wright, who came to the Celtics from the Mavericks in the Rondo (and Dwight Powell) deal, while Davis came to the Celtics via the trading away of MarShon Brooks and Celtics legend Jordan Crawford. And to finally tie this all up, Brooks was only on the Celtics because of the initial Pierce and KG trade.  The 2023 and 2025 picks are both second rounders, but it will be very interesting to see how the rest of the rippling effect plays out"
"(1) Curry  (2) AD  (3) MPJ  (4) Eric Gordon  (5) PJ wASHINGTON  (6) GTJ  (7) Matisse Thybulle  &amp;#x200B;  Imho this is a championship team  I based it on [2kratings.com](https://2kratings.com) as you said  And EG would be a perfect 6th man right here, both gtj and matisse could rotate sg minutes, as matisse is the near perfect pairing with steph. while we have a walmart shooting klay in mpj. and ad is just ad, can fit anywhere"
"I’m going to try to also just include mainly role players.    C: Myles Turner  PF: Giannis  SF: KD  SG: Klay Thompson  PG: Jrue Holiday   Bench:  Reggie Jackson  Seth Curry  Matisse Thybulle  Robert Covington  Joe Ingles  Bobby Portis  Brook Lopez     Definitely could be better when some of the non All Star picks but without picking fringe All Stars, I like this team. Jrue was the toughest pick as I wasn’t sure if CP3, Trae, Booker among others were Superstars so I decided between Jrue and Lowry. Jrue I think fits better with a team like this personally."
"PG: Jrue Holiday (All Star)  SG: Bogdan Bogdanovich  SF: Paul George (All Star)  PF: Kawhi Leonard (Superstar)  C: Jokic (Superstar)  Bench Dejounte Murray, G  Jalen Brunson, G  Mikal Bridges, F  Matisse Thybulle, F  Joe Ingles, F  Draymond Green, F/C  Clint Capela, C"
"Pg: Steph Curry  Sg: Paul George  Sf: Jayson Tatum  Pf: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Myles Turner  6th man: Tim Hardaway Jr.  Bench: Tyrese Haliburton, Pat Bev, Matisse Thybulle, Harrison Barnes, Jonás Valanciunas, Danilo Gallinari"
Matisse Thybulle
Matisse Thybulle averaged 3.9 PPG in 2020 but was named to the All-Defensive 2nd Team.  Thybulle was 3rd in steals despite only averaging 20 minutes a game.
"Matisse Thybulle. NBA All-Defensive second team, only averaged 20 minutes per game and 3.9 PPG last season"
"Matisse Thybulle, Dean Wade"
He could be better at finishing through contact and I’m not even talking about the infamous pass to Matisse Thybulle.
"Aside from the Superstars and all-stars, MPJ is my pick. He’ll be the second option on offense this year which is a step in maximizing his potential. Also, I like to see D-Fox build on his great year last year. Also, the Hornets’ young guns are entertaining to watch along with their play-by-play guy. “Hum diddly dee” “MILES BRIDGES OHHHHHH!” And the like lol.  I’m also excited for the Sixers to shit the bed this year because Sixers fans are annoying as hell. “Muh Matisse Thybulle” “Muh Tyrese Maxey” even tho I like them both as players."
But Thybulle does? what young player has DPOY potential if not matisse?
Muh Matisse Thybulle. Muh Tyrese Maxey
But muh Matisse Thybulle!!!!
"Matisse Thybulle is way to pretty, distracts his teammates..."
Matisse Thybulle - 4 points 5 steals 5 blocks
"Danny Green - one steal, one block.  Matisse Thybulle - two steals, two blocks."
"Narrative unanimity and/or rule changes. If they bring back hand checking, that opens it up a lot, because guards will be able to defend larger players one-on-one without coaches sending another guy over. Players, opposing coaches, and media members would all have to agree about the vote publicly. The award was originally made in part because Michael Cooper and Sidney Moncrief weren't getting enough credit. The player would also have to *look* insanely active on-ball, not just be insanely active on-ball. Even big fans of the sport don't see defense unless it results in a block or steal. He has to switch onto big guys and strip them or not give up ground, and jump passing lanes for steals. It would also require the player to be good on offense. Like Mookie Blaylock or Eddie Jones two-way good. Unlike some of the bigs that have won the award/finished high in the voting that have been stiffs on the other end, a guard has to justify the big minutes they would need for cumulative stats like DefWS, anything using +/-, even steals. That's why someone like Matisse Thybulle can't win it, but Rudy Gobert can. I don't think the days of Doug Christie getting DPOY votes will be coming back.  Here's a Frankenstein's monster of what I think it would take:  * Dwyane Wade's help blocks * Gary Payton's visible on-ball activity * Chris Paul's late 2000s help steals * Jrue Holiday's ability to take a back-down by thrusting his hips * Sidney Moncrief's shot strips and hip angle cutoffs (much harder when players can carry the ball for two steps and never get called) * Jamal Crawford's likeability (when he isn't on your team) * Mo Cheeks' push-ahead poke steals when defender is in a low dribble * Tony Allen's forearms and ability to get away with hand checking * Crazy lateral acceleration. I can't even think of a comp at this size."
1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter 5. Darius Garland 6. Tyler Herro 7. Matisse Thybulle 8. Kevin Porter Jr. 9. Rui Hachimura 10. Keldon Johnson 11. PJ Washington 12. Luguentz Dort 13. Cameron Johnson 14. Brandon Clarke
peak roberson was better than thybulle IMO. but he was also more experienced than matisse is
"Ah yes the Mt Rushmore of perimeter defenders - Michael Jordan, Gary Payton, Dennis Johnson all long Hall of Fame careers with 9x All-Defense... and then Matisse Thybulle after 2500 minutes.  Come on - Thybulle is very good but he has such an incredibly long way to go to be considered in the same breath as the all-time great defenders."
"&gt; Matisse and dort have the same career 3pt %  Since they're young players, specifically just finishing their sophomore season, it's illogical to use their career 3p%. They're prone to having big improvements as they get more accustomed to the league. For example, last season:  Thybulle: 30.1% on 2.2 3PA  Dort: 34.3% on 6.3 3PA"
"Even ignoring 3P%  Dort is a much better offensive player while being elite on defense  This guy dropped 30 in a game 7 against my team, he even dropped 42 this year.   Thybulle is still a stud and has room for growth but Dort and some of those other guys are better until Matisse shows improvement"
"Sixers are well poised for Ben to stay home.  They have Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton competing for minutes already, and then drafted Jaden Springer.  Milton is a legit nba player, and Maxey looks to be even better.    This is a Khawi Leonard-San Antonio holdout/injury situation.  Both sided need to call it a mental health break, like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka did.    Considering Philly's bench also includes prospects they are high on and want to showcase for potential trades, like Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Bball Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, seems to me the Sixers can win on the court and develop at the same time Ben sits out.    If any of Chicago, Portland or Minnesota gets off to a poor start while the Sixers and Embiid chug along, philly's chances of getting Lillard, Lavine, or Edwards increases.    Edwards most likely, because KAT, Malik Beasley and Dangelo Russell and Jaden McDaniels all fit around Ben Simmons  better than Edwards if the Wolves were to trade for him.  Plus, Morey built a team lat year suited for James Harden, stands to reason the next best thing would be a prospect with Harden's skillset like Anthony Edwards.  ."
Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey have been the second coming of Jesus for Sixer fans lmao.
"If you watch the Matisse thybulle vlogs he shows off a lot of the resort, the rooms themselves weren’t anything crazy."
Ben Simmons trade won’t get done by the start of the regular season and Simmons doesn’t play - Matisse Thybulle and Paul Reed get playing time and surprise a lot of people.
"While I agree I do wonder if maybe there's a sense of necessity/urgency as far as getting *something* good/great back for him just because outside of Embiid nothing has worked out for the Sixers.  1st rd picks going back to 2014 when they drafted Embiid:  2014 - Embiid, Elfrid Payton.  Embiid obviously a centerpiece, but Payton was never all that special and still isn't today.  2015 - Jahlil Okafor -  Do I really need say anything?  Wasted 3rd pick.  2016 - Simmons, TLC, Korkmaz.  Simmons has been a disappointment, soon to be traded.  Wasted 1st pick possibly, depends on if they get extremely lucky with a trade. TLC is an ok bench player in limited stretches but nothing special, same for Korkmaz  2017 - Fultz - Had the yips, got traded, is halfway decent now.  Not great, not terribly special, but just ""ok"".  Wasted 1st pick.  2018 - Bridges and Shamet.  Bridges immediately traded for rights to Zhaire Smith (who has played like 13 games total in 2 yrs for Philly).  Shamet was solid, but he's gone too.  2019 - Ty Jerome whose rights were traded for Matisse ""Career avgs of 4.3/1.8/1.1"" Thybulle.    2020 - Tyrese Maxey.  Solid young player with lots of potential, but he's got a ways to go.  Oh and don't forget that after 2018/19 they lost Jimmy Butler.  I wouldn't be surprised if they feel like the last 7 years of moves has left them with nothing to show for it other than Embiid and now they feel pressure to get something ""good"" for Simmons, otherwise they just keep wasting FRP's for nothing.  I mean, this is the type of performance the avg GM would be on the hot seat for...a bunch of lottery picks that turned out to be one superstar who likely won't be dominant for long thanks to injury-history and a bunch of flameouts who ended up getting traded for Dorito-crumbs and bench players."
So Matisse Thybulle?
"It's not a ""most important"" defender of the year or ""most impactful"" defender of the year award. It's purposefully ambiguous. If Matisse Thybulle has an all-time defensive season for a guard, there's no reason he can't win it unless a center has an equally outstanding year.  All things equal, you're right, it'll always be a center. But if Thybulle or even Simmons dominate and nobody stands out amongst the centers, they could win."
# MATISSE THYBULLE
"i feel like matisse thybulle could do it in a few years. oddly enough, his offense needs to improve for him to be DPOY - if his offense improves, he gets more play time, more recognition, etc."
Matisse Thybulle with a reliable 36% 3 point shot would be playing a lot more than 20 minutes per game
"Wiggins, Gobert, Simmons (prior to the playoffs), Jaden McDaniels, James Wiseman, Matisse Thybulle, Draymond Green, Bradley Beal, Butler, Myles Turner, DeAndre Ayton, Westbrook,"
If you replace Seth Curry with Davion Mitchell or maybe even Matisse Thybulle they would be my favorites.
"I mean I think that Ben and the Sixers best assets if they truly gave up the farm (Maxey, Thybulle, 4 draft picks and 3 swaps over the never 7 seasons) would be a solid value.  Especially considering that in 7 years who the hell knows what the Sixers will be like, unprotected or lightly protected picks years in the future are very valuable  Also the amount of shooters Ben would be surrounded with in Portland would help him thrive. Ben has a much lower usage rate than Dame, which would help his teammates thrive in some ways.   And maxey might be really good one day. Or maybe he’ll just be okay. Too early to tell.   Matisse who knows if the offense will catch up but he’s a special defender.  I do think Simmons fits well as constructed. And I think he’d help the defense immensely.   I’m a Big Ben fan, bigger than most. I’m completely on the side of keeping Ben (assuming he can be convinced, we’ve all seen the reports.)   That said, you don’t trade one of the best players in franchise history while they’re in their prime and get better usually"
"Double the volume is a huge difference. But it’s actually a bit more nuanced than that. Thybulle has shot 5.6 3pa per 100 possessions for his career, while roco shot 7.7 3pa per 100 last year. However, last year looks like a bit of an aberration, as he’s shot about 10 3pa per 100 for most of his career. So again, about double matisse’s volume, which is huge.  Then you look at percentages. Roco career 36% from 3, thybulle career 33%. So roco has had league-average 3pt efficiency on borderline high volume, while matisse has had significantly below league-average efficiency on low to medium volume. That’s a massive difference."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"What you are saying is true.  However, the Sixers know this as well and have been trying to draft a chucker to take over in the 4th like Jimmy Butler did three years ago.  It's so important, the Sixers traded up to #1 for Markelle Fultz.  But going back to your point about leverage, Morey and Sixers fans are or should be justifiably excited about Tyrese Maxey filling that role, I think.  Maxey is as much of a hit as Matisse Thybulle.  The sky is not falling."
"Definitely Matisse Thybulle. If you discount anything to do with putting the ball in the hoop, it’s legitimately insane what he does on the defensive end. I once heard him describe himself as a defensive playmaker and it really shows if you actually watch him in game, it’s savant-like and if he played starter minutes he might legitimately be the best defender in the NBA. He’s also charismatic and v handsome."
[matisse thybulle and furkan korkmaz are best friends (a wholesome thread)](https://twitter.com/mvptisse/status/1406631053171757057?s=21)
Well deserved. I watch tony allen ~~defensive~~ highlights once a year. People like him make me love watching basketball. I really hope the nba makes defense more feasible in the future so we can get more players like him. shout out to matisse thybulle.
The answer to every question is Matisse Thybulle
He's basically lost Australia.  We're all about Matisse Thybulle now after that Olympic performance.  Plus we got Josh Giddey and Jock Landale coming into the league next season too.
"Who says no?   Sixers get:   * Jerami Grant  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Pistons get:   * Jaden McDaniels  * Naz Reid  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * 2023, 2025 Sixers 1sts  * 2023, 2025 Wolves 1sts   * 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 Sixers pick swap options  Sixers get a championship roster top to bottom. Beverley/Green/Grant/Harris/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man is FILTHY.   Wolves get Ben without giving up D'Lo, Ant, or KAT. D'Lo/Curry/Ant/Simmons/KAT is a good ass team  Pistons flip their star to launch their rebuild forward. They get four great prospects, four 1sts, and four pick swaps (two of which will probably be really valuable down the line once Embiid and Harris are old)."
Sixers get:   * CJ McCollum  * Patrick Beverley  * Naz Reid  * Wolves 2023 1st   Wolves get:   * Ben Simmons  * Seth Curry  Blazers get:   * Matisse Thybulle  * Malik Beasley  * Jaden McDaniels  * Jake Layman
"&gt;  &gt; Sources: Ben Simmons tells team brass he no longer wants to be a Sixer and does not intend to report to training camp &gt;  &gt; Keith Pompey August 31, 2021 &gt;  &gt; Ben Simmons let it be known that he wants out. &gt;  &gt; In a meeting with the 76ers last week in Los Angeles, Simmons told team co-managing partner Josh Harris, president of basketball operations Daryl Morey, general manager Elton Brand and coach Doc Rivers that he no longer wants to remain a Sixer, according to multiple sources. &gt;  &gt; Sources said the three-time All-Star also does not intend to report to training camp. &gt;  &gt; For the second time since December, the Sixers are unsuccessfully trying to trade Simmons, whose trade value has diminished. At the beginning of this past season, they tried to send him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for James Harden. The Rockets ultimately traded Harden to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 11. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers are having a tough time finding a team to meet their lofty trade demands. &gt;  &gt; The organization does not want to trade Simmons for less than what it believes is fair market value. The four told Simmons they wanted him to report to the start of training camp on Sept. 28 and be a part of the team. &gt;  &gt; The source said, however, the Sixers’ inability to get fair market value isn’t Simmons’ fault. &gt;  &gt; Another source said there’s no shortage of teams still interested, but the problem is Morey is demanding a king’s ransom. &gt;  &gt; Simmons is fully aware the Sixers can fine him for holding out and failing to show up to training camp. But a source said money will not play a role in the decision-making for Simmons, who has four years and $147 million remaining on his deal. &gt;  &gt; Plus, fining Simmons could strain the Sixers’ relationship with his super agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. Paul has a who’s who of clients — players the Sixers might be interested in pursuing down the road in free agency. &gt;  &gt; When asked specifically whether he thought Simmons would come back at all, a source responded “no,” resolutely. &gt;  &gt; None of this should come as a surprise. &gt;  &gt; As The Inquirer noted on July 26, if Simmons really wants out, he could opt to be disruptive or not show up for training camp. The tactic has worked for many elite professional athletes across sports who want to be traded. &gt;  &gt; On Aug. 9, ESPN analyst Kendrick Perkins said Simmons is willing to hold out of training camp as long as it takes to get traded. &gt;  &gt; Time will tell if the 25-year-old reports and/or if the team avoids what is bound to be a circus-like atmosphere by trading him in the weeks leading up to camp. &gt;  &gt; The belief around the league is the Sixers have been holding out for six-time All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard to request a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. But Lillard said, “I’m not leaving [Portland] — not right now at least” on Wednesday during an Instagram Live stream. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers’ best consolation could be circling back to the Blazers for a potential deal involving shooting guard CJ McCollum before the start of training camp. That trade would make sense for both teams. &gt;  &gt; In addition to fulfilling needs, the players have similar salaries. Simmons will make $33 million next season, while McCollum will receive $30.8 million. &gt;  &gt; The problem is both teams might think they should get more in return. &gt;  &gt; McCollum, 29, has averaged 18.9 points while shooting 38.9% on 3-pointers in 528 career games with 431 starts. However, the eight-year veteran out of Lehigh is not an All-Star after years of playing in the tough Western Conference. &gt;  &gt; Even still, he could be the best option and a good pickup right before training camp with all things considered. &gt;  &gt; League sources believe the Sixers will have a tough time getting what they perceive as fair market value under the circumstances. &gt;  &gt; “Think about three months ago when the Sixers are willing to give up Ben Simmons. You are like, ‘Let’s see what we have to do to get him,’” said a Western Conference executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “Now, the difference is Ben Simmons says he refuses to play for the Sixers. He wants to go to three California teams. There’s so much bad blood between him and the team.” &gt;  &gt; The executive said teams are not willing to give in to the Sixers’ steep asking price knowing they have to move Simmons. &gt;  &gt; “The kid said he’s not going back,” the executive said. “I’m not giving you what you’re demanding. They really messed this up.” &gt;  &gt; A source believes the devaluing of Simmons began with Rivers’ postgame comments following the Game 7 loss to the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference semifinals on June 20. &gt;  &gt; That’s when the coach, who has been one of Simmons’ biggest supporters and defenders, was asked by The Inquirer’s David Murphy if the standout is still capable of being a point guard on a championship-caliber team. &gt;  &gt; “I don’t know the answer to that right now,” Rivers responded on a night when Simmons finished with five points, 13 assists, eight rebounds and was sidelined the final 40 seconds of the 103-96 loss. &gt;  &gt; He attempted just four shots, making two. For the fourth straight game, Simmons did not attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. He played timid, appearing fearful to go to the foul line. &gt;  &gt; That became apparent with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and the Sixers trailing, 88-86. He drove to the basket past Danilo Gallinari, but passed up an open dunk underneath the basket, dishing the ball to Matisse Thybulle, who was fouled by John Collins. Thybulle made one of two free throws. &gt;  &gt; The day after wavering, Rivers did say that Simmons is salvageable. He said the Sixers would put together the right type of offseason workout plan to help correct Simmons’ shooting deficiencies. But a source said Simmons has not participated in a Sixers offseason workout plan. &gt;  &gt; The source believes it will be tough for Simmons to have a working relationship with the team moving forward. At the same time, the team isn’t trying to let their multifaceted player go for little in return. &gt;  &gt; The Sixers would definitely have a lot of holes to fill by getting rid of Simmons. &gt;  &gt; In addition to being the point guard, Simmons is a two-time NBA All-Defensive player, a third-team All-NBA selection, a small-ball center and reserve power forward. &gt;  &gt; Can one envision Simmons returning to the Sixers for two months just to raise his trade value? And with all the heat he’ll likely receive from Sixers fans, he might benefit from a change of scenery."
Matisse Thybulle &gt;&gt; LeBron finally confirmed
Matisse Thybulle is still in the league
"&gt;If you have a player who's good enough to ensure you make the playoffs but bad enough to ensure you never win a championship, that's a negative asset at any amount of money.     I disagree with this statement, with the caveat that it depends on how how the rest of the team is constructed and how that extra money is used.   There is a point at which a Ben Simmons contract would be positive value. He's basically a beefed up Matisse Thybulle (doesn't help that the 76ers have two of the exact same player lol) and Thybulle on a rookie contract is valuable to a team with chip aspirations because he is  cheap enough that you can plug him in when you need some extra defense but also can sit him and still afford to trot out an NBA caliber starting lineup. Can't really do that with Ben if he's eating up max money.   Idk what that point is where Ben would be seen a positive value asset, I'd guess like $18m AAV on a shorter contract and I'd imagine lots of teams would be clamoring for him. But we're obviously not seeing this when he's on a max lol."
&gt;Simmons was almost moved to the Rockets along with Matisse Thybulle and two first-round picks in the James Harden negotiations.   I can't believe Sixers fans look at that offer (those two firsts were most likely 2021 and 2023 picks) and still think that the only reason we didn't send Harden to them is because Tilman hates Morey.

"In the end though, Nuggets still have the ball. I love defense but offense is just so much more important.  For example: Matisse Thybulle has not changed one bit on offense, but he still has really good defense. But his black hole of offense makes him unplayable on the court for stretches at a time."

"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
"&gt;sources say he did pass all his fries to Matisse Thybulle, who was then smacked on the arm by Danny Green while he attempted to dunk the fries into his own ketchup. Green, who reportedly was very hungry that day, declined to comment."
C’mon now even 76ers players themselves (not named Joel Embiid) are saying he was thrown under a bus. Matisse Thybulle said those exact words on camera in JJ Redick’s podcast.
"Let me explain from the top:  1. A must win game in the ECS between the Hawks and Sixers; where Ben ""The Socialite"" Simmons has a chance to layup the ball. Unfortunately, he was against DPOY candidate Trae Young. So Simmons passed the ball over to Matisse Thybulle, who got fouled and and made one freethrow. The momentum is lost and the Sixers lose. 2. During the interview, frustations build up in the coach Doc ""blows leads"" Rivers and Joel ""The Process"" Embiid. They end up throwing the over coddled socialite under the bus for the loss.  3. After an entire offseason of heckling, the young socialite demands a trade which unfortunately, the Sixers couldn't find. So Simmons sits out the camp saying he won't ever play a game for the Sixers. And ongoing drama.  Tried making it dramatic and soap-opera like. Hope this helps."
That agent's name? Matisse Thybulle.
"He shot over 40% from 3 in college and was one of the best pick and roll ball handlers in college I’ve seen since, I don’t even know when. Dame? College fultz wasn’t just the #1, he was the undisputed #1. He was so, so good. If you get a chance to go back and watch you’ll also get a nice view of his college teammate, Matisse Thybulle, on his way to beat Gary Payton’s PAC-12 steals record."
"Simmons trade idea of the day:   Sixers receive:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  Wizards receive:   * Ben Simmons  Raptors receive:   * Davis Bertans  * Seth Curry  * Kyle Kuzma  * Matisse Thybulle  * Tyrese Maxey  * Sixers 2023, 2027 1sts   * Sixers pick swaps every other year available  * Wizards 2025, 2027 1sts   We know that the Raptors were interested in moving on from Siakam last year (he was heavily linked to the Warriors). We know that the Wizards could use Ben Simmons. We know the Sixers are win-now and want star power.   Sixers immediately say yes to turning Simmons, Curry, Thybulle, Maxey, and picks into Siakam and VanVleet. That's two borderline all-star level players that take them, in my opinion, to the top of the Eastern Conference. VanVleet/Green/Siakam/Harris/Embiid is ridiculous. Fred and Pascal can both shoot well enough, Pascal is of course a do it all wing, Fred can run point, and both play good defense.   Wizards move a negative asset (Bertans), some second-rate youth, and some picks for Ben Simmons. A Beal/Simmons pairing works really well. Simmons can run point and play defense, Beal can play off ball and take all the shots.   Raptors move a guy they've been interested in moving (Siakam) plus a guard in his absolute prime who has limitations to his game and who doesn't quite fit their timeline (Fred). In return, they get a wealth of picks and young players, plus a PG and two forwards who can contribute immediately (Seth, Bertans, Kuzma). They can probably flip one or more of those guys for more assets or a player who fits better. Meanwhile, Matisse is a total Masai player, and Maxey is a decently promising young guard -- something the Raptors lack.    Who says no?"

"Ben Simmons on passing up an open dunk to get it to Thybulle: “I looked, and they left Matisse wide open. I was like me, okay, but Matisse, you gonna leave him open? Bad idea, buddy.”"
"Oh for sure danny and matisse are not completely out of place at the 3. The problem is that the sixers are not a powerhouse offensive team like the jazz that can afford to put out smaller lineups. They've always leaned on their size to stifle opposing offenses. I just don't like the idea of a defensive oriented team trotting out danny green at the 3. Even if mcdaniels is raw, he shot 37% from 3 last year and is a good onball defender. Come playoff time I'd put mcdaniels on tatum, durant and middleton before green and thybulle.  Also with dragic and boucher, I'm not 100% sure on their fit, and the fact that they're making a combined 26 million means the sixers are getting back 1 more player at most. Don't feel good about boucher and 35 year old dragic being the main ""win now"" return on a simmons trade."
"What's your re-draft to include all 3 of them in the top 7?

I've also seen JJ Redick and Jimmy Butler stand up for him along with Dwight.  I see him and the young guns (Thybulle/Maxey) give props to each other a lot when they make defensive plays together. He actually does seem like he's their vet. When they make hustle plays he goes over and daps them.  But I'm not a Philly fan who watches the team all the time so idk."
"&gt;He just refuses to take any blame  he literally got *all* the blame lmao freaking Thybulle even went public saying he deserves some of the blame and the whole city of philadelphia went ""noooo Matisse, you did nothing wrong. its all Bens fault"" lol"
Who is matisse thybulle
"Blowout trade:   Timberwolves get:   * Ben Simmons  Sixers get:   * Pascal Siakam  * Fred VanVleet  * Malik Beasley  * Patrick Beverley  Raptors get:   * Tobias Harris  * Matisse Thybulle  * Jaden McDaniels  * Taurean Prince  * Wolves 2023, 2025 1sts  Sixers run VanVleet/Cury/Green/Siakam/Embiid with Beasley as sixth man. That's a great, well-built roster (better than trying to force Siakam/Harris to play together)  Timberwolves get Ben for their assets, as they desire  Raptors move Pascal (which it's been hinted they want to do) for McDaniels and Matisse, who both fit their prospect profile to a T, plus Tobias Harris to fill in for Siakam -- they can flip him later for more assets. In the mean time, they run Dragic/GTJ/OG/Harris/Boucher with Flynn/Thybulle/McDaniels/Barnes/Precious off the bench. Plus some draft capital to play with"
Right. They’re bad. Almost always. What they do is not a good indication of what works in the NBA as a result. That’s my entire point.   There are plenty of guys who can’t do shit on offense who are rotational players. Matisse Thybulle is an easy example for this. He couldn’t do anything offensively last year at all and still played 20 mpg. I already know what you’re going to say. He shot 3% better than Okogie from 3pt range lol.
"but then you are punishing the defender for existing. For instance against thybulle, he never really ""blew"" past him, he'd just get a step. Thybulle wouldn't usually fully close out because he knew trae likes to get that foul. When he didn't close out trae would turn (literally turn his head away from the basket to find thybulle) and jump in whichever direction sent him towards Matisse.   In one instance Matisse literally dove out of the way and trae's hand, his fucking hand, made contact with Thybulle's leg AFTER the shot... Trae still went to the line. A defender should be entitled to their cylinder and right now the way trae plays they are not."
And Matisse Thybulle got minutes despite being pretty frickin bad offensively
"Yeah I know, I'm taking about the old ass Gary Payton  Dude played in a shitty era, he would be a better Matisse Thybulle I guess but wouldn't start on most teams."
"Gary Payton and Gary Payton II are not the same player, one came first.  Also calling Gary Payton a role player is absurd, he averaged 24 ppg on 50% fg% along with *9 assists* and being the best defensive PG in the league during his best season, and led the sonics to the finals. Matisse Thybulle averages 4 points in 20 minutes despite being a great defender"
"Matisse Thybulle isn't really a nobody, but both are and would be defensive specialists only. Both would come off the bench on 25 teams"
"He'd be Matisse Thybulle in todays NBA, dude was such a glorified role player it's disgusting"
"1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett 4. DeAndre Hunter  5. Darius Garland  6. Tyler Herro  7. PJ Washington  8. Rui Hachimura 9. Brandon Clarke  10. Matisse Thybulle 11. Keldon Johnson  12. Kevin Porter Jr   I'd take all of those guys ahead of him for sure, and then the debate for thw other two top-14 spots is between:  * Jordan Poole * Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Cam Johnson  * Cam Reddish * Darius Bazley * Nicolas Claxton * Terance Mann  * Lu Dort (whowent undrafted)  There's definitely a debate to be had, but I'd be leaning Cam Johnson and Lu Dort."
They've got his replacement already in Matisse Thybulle.

"This question kind of reminds me of the Duncan Robinson vs Tyler Herro question last year (so after the finals). I think Maxey has the higher potential to become a multi-talented player in the league but exactly how productive his wider skillset will be is unknown atm. There have been many players exploding for a big scoring game and great showings, after all they're NBA players. Even end-of-bench guys are capable of scoring great numbers on singular nights, it's the consistency that decides your role in the league.  With that in mind I think Matisse Thybulle is set to be a vital piece on contending, championship-ready teams for his entire career. He literally only needs a solid catch and shoot 3 to be one of the best roleplayers in the league. His value is evident and a league that focusses on Superstars plus their sidekicks Matisse low demand on-ball is actually an advantage since your best player will hold the ball most of the time anyways if you're on an elite team. Those teams Matisse will enhance greatly with his concentrated skillset, a real x-factor type player poised for a long career in the league.   Right now I have doubts that Maxey will improve to the extent that his larger array of ""pretty good"" skills across the board will be of more use than Thybulle's isolated generational defensive talent if we're talking about teams that are in serious talks for a ring any given year. On a bad to average team you'd want Maxey but once you reach the top tier franchises an elite specialist will become better and better as they are ceiling raisers for teams that have great players for any demanded skillset already."
Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey are both relatively young players on the Philadelphia 76ers.
I mean 4 first round picks and 4 picks swaps prolly have more value than ben Simmons Matisse thybulle at this point
Tyrese Haliburton  Kevin heurter Matisse Thybulle  Josh hart  Damian Jones   Aside from halli I’m fine with our choices 😂
"They misspelled Tobias Harris name as Tobian Harris. The disrespect.  ""*His Sixers teammates, including high profile Joel Embiid, Tobian Harris and Matisse Thybulle – were willing to jump on a plane to go and convince their lost star to return*."""
"Matisse Thybulle quote from OM&amp;T3:  &gt; “On a human level, as his teammate and as a friend, you hate to see people put in this situation that’s so heavily covered by the media. Because people lose sight of the human aspect of us athletes, especially during controversial times; we’re looked at as a commodity.  &gt; “I don’t even know exactly what people consider us in these moments, but it’s not as humans.”  Ben’s got glaring weaknesses as a player, but being dangled publicly in trade talks for a year + is a pretty damning show of no confidence, and then people kill you when your **team** loses, and kill you for your decision to say “Get me out of here, you don’t want me anyways.”  If he’s really willing to give up game checks to get out of there, more power to him."
Two words. Matisse Thybulle.
The deal wasn’t just Simmons. The deal would be Ben Simmons+ Seth Curry or Matisse Thybulle and then probably some picks. They definitely weren’t saying it was a 1 for 1 trade.
"I feel like most of my controversial opinions are of older players and most young guys are just ""meh, we'll see"" type of guys.  Closest I can think of would probably be something like Matisse Thybulle is top 10 shooting guard in NBA right now.  I'm assuming saying something like Trae Young is worst point of attack defender in NBA isn't really all that controversial."
"In offense, clearly not I would rank him 4th or 5th offensively (within PG's). However I feel the fact that Conley for me would rank somewhere on the 6-9 range in terms of defense as far as point guards go does balance it quite a bit when Young would be bottom 3 with being arguably worst point guard in terms of defense and I would argue worst point of attack defender in the league out of players that actually play solid minutes.  If that seems crazy to you I'm guessing you would also put Caruso and Simmons really low. No idea why you don't have issue with Holiday then? Because of playoffs storylines or something?  I'm guessing with that it would be equally crazy to you to hear if I say that Matisse Thybulle was borderline top 10 shooting guard last season."
"I assume then Paul, Curry, Lowry, Rondo and both Ball Brothers among of many lesser names would be disqualified from that PG title as well?  I mean should we consider Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier as PG's as well from now on due to their defensive responsibilities?"
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
Matisse pointing out something true.  The media picks the narrative they believe will resonate... The Ben Simmons is afraid to shoot narrative has more draw than.... Matisse committed a costly foul.  It was always gonna fall on Simmons TBH.  The Simmons narrative creates an opportunity to talk about Simmons whole career framed in a different light.  Conversation around Thybulle is far less gratifying to expound on lol.
I get your point but football is a wrong example. As the value of a goal is much much higher than say value of a basket  And more importantly good defensive players have to also contribute offensively in basketball. That's the reason Matisse Thybulle starts from the bench. The Bucks beat my Suns not because of Jrues defense but because he really stepped out hugely in offense. Whereas say Van Dijk the best defender itw for me won't even contribute to the final third through a goal or assist(unless it's a set piece)
Matisse Thybulle from the sixers. Every team needs a Matisse.
"Matisse Thybulle, Wes Matthews, Serge Ibaka, Bruce Brown"
Matisse Thybulle for the Sixers
"Offtopic: what a weird way to describe who was going. ""Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris, Matisse Thybulle and most of the team"". Why not just say ""Most of the team"", or ""Sixers players""?"
"&gt; The core leaders on the 76ers — such as Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris and Matisse Thybulle — and most of the team were set to take a jet to see Simmons before being turned away, sources said. Multiple sources said Simmons didn’t want his teammates, some of whom he considers friends, to make the Philadelphia-to-Los Angeles commute out of courtesy because he won’t change his mind on wanting a trade.  It's nice of you to not have them waste their time, but at least give them a chance Ben"
He's right. Defense is only an art you understand if you turn your attention to the defender or sometimes even away from the ball (which few people do). You have to know what to look for and I understand many people would rather watch the ball in Steph Curry's hands than the feet of Matisse Thybulle. It's only natural.
Matisse Thybulle does a lot of staring at the refs for a player of his caliber.
"I thought Thybulle and Edwards were the same height, but Matisse looks much taller"
Matisse Thybulle. The Jazz need him.
"he was the NCAA DPOY for '19-'20 lol it's one of our more obvious picks but he can't handle the ball or really shoot consistently. kinda like matisse thybulle, you want him on the floor to cause defensive chaos"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
"Elton Brand supporters have the most irrational arguments.  ""Brand is great! he had all the power and gets all the credit for drafting Matisse Thybulle and signing shake to a 4 year minimum!   ""Also, Brand is great! he had no power and deserves no blame for trading for a player the clips were going to let walk in the off-season, and for then giving that player one of the worst contracts in the league! He also had nothing NOTHING to do with signing horford for 4 years $97 million!"""
And Matisse Thybulle!
Davion Mitchell is closer to Frank Ntilikina than Matisse Thybulle
matisse thybulle as defence
"&gt; The argument would have to go both ways to argue their offensive games are equally developed.   Buddy you need to try a little harder to my comments, I never said they were equally developed. In the original comment you replied to I literally said Mitchell's offense was better.   &gt; Mitchell is going to adjust and his numbers are going to come up and be clearly beyond what Thybulle is capable of, he’s just in a tough spot to adjust to having to deal with NBA defenders. The reason he’s asked to create his own shot is because he has the ability to get more comfortable and effectively contribute in that manner, while Thybulle absolutely does not.   Cool. I'm not arguing that Mitchell has the same offensive potential as Matisse, the point of contention with the original guy who replied to me was over their offensive games today.   Maybe I wasn't clear enough with my position. I believe that there is a threshold for offensive production that teams have for players. If players fall below that threshold, you do not want to give them the ball or have them take too many shots. Both Matisse and Mitchell are far below that threshold. Mitchell is closer to it than Thybulle, but they are both clearly at the point, right now, where you don't want them taking many shots if you actually want to win games. Does Mitchell have a higher chance of knocking down a contested 3? Sure. Do I want Mitchell shooting a contested 3? Absolutely not. They are both at the level where they should probably be the last option in any given lineup.   &gt; He hasn’t shown he’s capable of more though, he has basically the least developed offensive game possible, he wouldn’t be on the floor if not for defense because there’s no point in developing it.   I don't see what the point of this is. Mitchell wouldn't be in the NBA if not for his defense either.    &gt; I’m also not sure why you got so sensitive about me bringing up sample sizes. Is that too complicated bruv?   Lol? That's a bit aggressive. I think you're getting a little too emotionally invested in this, my guy. I'll say it once again: I'm not arguing over Mitchell's career potential, only what we've seen from his game so far. He's a guy you want on the floor purely for defensive production, and he gives you almost nothing on offense. Marcus Smart gives you more than both for offense. The sample size is irrelevant."
"If Matisse were on the Thunder he'd be 32 minutes per game also. At best either player is the 4th best on a championship team. The way I see it, Thybulle is better and more switchable on defense. On offense he'd just be spacing, which is about all you'd ask Dort to do on a contender."
Matisse Thybulle ! low usage but high impact defensive. Dorts defense has taken a high this season too
&gt; Just that every second basketball-liking dude in Australia right now is gonna tell you they're a Bucks fan or at the very least that they love Giannis so just be ready for that.  Are they really that big on Oz? I figured there'd be a lot of Nets/76ers fans with Patty Mills/Matisse Thybulle.
"No Embiid for all 6, no Tobias Harris for 3 of those, and no Matisse Thybulle for all 6 kinda hurts more than you'd expect"
"He studied Matisse all year which really helped him. You see he blocks jumpers from behind sometimes like Thybulle likes to. His off-ball could still improve, but he’s made major strides as a defender"
"No Embiid, No Matisse Thybulle, and even No Ben Simmons lol  And here we are, in Denver, with the altitude, blowing out the Nuggets. Damn it feels good to be a sixers fan."
"no embiid, no danny green, no ben simmons, no matisse thybulle, no problem!"
"&gt;&gt; Beyond Embiid, the Sixers’ combination of All-Star caliber players (Tobias Harris) and high-level role players (Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Georges Niang, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz, Danny Green et al.) means there’s no need to take on more players of that ilk.   Cue armchair experts moaning about how Sixers should trade him for a bunch of role players."
Matisse Thybulle for the 2 and a half months he played in 2019. No bias
I’m sure Matisse Thybulle has amassed a +/- similar to that before.
"I'm just going to start making insane trade ideas at this point. I'm done for the season.  Let's trade Zion for Ben Simmons 3 firsts and Matisse Thybulle cause why not.   trade Ingram, Kira, Hayes, and 5 firsts for Damian Lillard.   Move the team to Baton Rouge and change the teams name to the Red Sticks."
"&gt; They both publicly lambasted him and embarrassed him in the media and in front of his peers. They were cruel and mean, and despite us believing all athletes should be tough, sometimes being attacked by people you trust can really hurt someone.  I think this is *really* overstating how critical they were of him. I think people build up more and more in their own heads how bad that was.  Doc was asked if Ben was a championship caliber PG and he said ""I don't know."" He didn't say ""nah, dude sucks"" or ""no team will ever win a title with Ben at PG."" He said ""I don't know."" Was it the ideal thing to say? No, but calling that cruel and mean is a huge stretch.  Joel was asked what the turning point in game 7 was. Here's his answer:   &gt;I’ll be honest. I thought the turning point was when we – I don’t know how to say it. But I thought the turning point was just, we had an open shot and we made one free throw and we missed the other and then they came down and scored and we didn’t get a good possession on the other end and Trae came back and he made a 3 and then, from there down four. And then I got – it’s on me. I turned the ball over, tried to make something happen from the perimeter. But I thought that was the turning point.  In that 6 sentence answer, he cites Ben not taking the dunk/layup, Thybulle missing a free throw and himself turning the ball over.  Is he criticizing Ben? Yes. He's also criticizing Matisse and himself. Is it cruel and mean? I can't see how anyone can characterize that as cruel and mean."
He's probably most similar to Matisse Thybulle.
This is not a great comparison. Nobody was asking Bud if Bledsoe was a championship-caliber point guard. Bledsoe wasn’t on a max contract and running away from the ball. He didn’t quit on his team. There’s a reason sixers fans didn’t go in on Matisse thybulle for sealing the game by fouling huerter on a three point attempt
"But according to raptors fans, the sixers should've traded him alongside Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, and a first for half a season of Lowry"

"Gonna plug my guy here and point out that Thybulle's per 36 is 3.4 steals/game and 2.4 blocks/game.  Caruso is 3.3 stl/game and 0.4 blocks/game.  PG is 2.6stl/game and 0.5 blocks/game.  Gary Trent is 2.6stl/game and 0.5 blocks/game.  Gary Payton II is 3.8 stl/game and 0.2 blocks/game.  In summary, Matisse Thybulle is a fucking monster on the defensive end."
"Not the best, but underrated is Matisse Thybulle"
"Here is the trade in question:  &gt;**Boston Celtics** receive: Karl-Anthony Towns  &gt;**Philadelphia 76ers** receive: Jaylen Brown and Patrick Beverley  &gt;**Minnesota Timberwolves** receive: Ben Simmons, Robert Williams III, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden Springer and 2022 first-round pick (from PHI)"
Morey: “Hear me out. If you include Jaylen Brown I will also throw in Matisse Thybulle for Jayson Tatum.”
Matisse Thybulle is a future DPOY and second place won't be close
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
"Hmm let’s see, they drafted Embiid, Then Simmons! One is a 4x all star who is almost impossible to guard, the other is a 3x all star that became a triple double machine, is a top 3 defensive player and won rookie of the year! Then they draft Fultz who turned out to be a bust for them but hey you can’t win em all, next they draft Mikel Brides but they decide to trade him to the suns for Zaire Smith and a future draft pick, Zaire ends up out of the league for good after an injury and Mikel becomes a stud for Phoenix BUT that future draft pick gets sent over to the clippers in a trade for Tobias Harris, a borderline all star! Next up the sixers make a trade with Celtics in the draft and acquired Matisse Thybulle, this guy is ALREADY one of the best defense players in the league and he’s starting to be more involved offensively! And lastly the Sixers end up with the steal of the 2020 draft, Tyrese Maxey, this kid is super quick and can get any basket that he wants ! He put up a career high 39 points in his rookie year in a game where most of our starters were out! Idk bro, it looks to me like they’ve done a good job Drafting since picking Embiid!"
"76ers entire starting 5 is out sans (Danny Green) plus Isiah Joe, and Matisse Thybulle."

"If any NBA player is a virgin, it’s Matisse Thybulle."
"&gt; Matisse Thybulle is already a hall of famer.  Spot on. This is my exact opinion as I've stated it. I believe that Thybulle is one of the greatest players of all time, not just on the defensive end but the offensive end."
"Lol okay dude. You're right, Matisse Thybulle is already a hall of famer. Keep working backwards from your desired result and throw out accusations whenever you're challenged."
first being the absolute power duo of george niang and matisse thybulle lmao
4pm: Matisse Thybulle is killed by a pack of 30-50 feral hogs
"Both what you said and he said can be true. Simmons for brown isn’t enough, but adding thybulle is too much without trying to do a package like Ben+shake+furk+2 firsts beforehand.   Rather try to make something like that work before matisse as a sixer fan, but if he and ben and some picks get shipped for brown right at the deadline it would be solid"

Whatever it takes for Wolves fans to stop acting like Jaden McDaniels is an untouchable asset worthy of an all star in a trade.  Dude makes Matisse Thybulle look like an offensively capable player and fouls out in 10 minutes
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
" It's a pretty funny assortment of players, too: Three smaller guards, three centers, one BBall Paul and one wing (Matisse Thybulle)"
DeRozan is bigger than Lavine   Thybulle is a shut down defender but DeMar was able to move the furniture when Matisse was on him which Zach can’t do  Edit: DeMar has 20 lbs on Thybulle so he can’t get bullied

"Ben Simmons,  Matisse thybulle, Shake Milton, and 2 frp for Tatum.   Neither team does this because they are huge rivals but I think it is fair"
Him and Kyrie and the only ones I've seen consistently destroy Matisse Thybulle over and over again in iso
"Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but those Sacramento and Memphis picks had a lot more speculative value than actual. They were one pick away from Tyler Herro and when you look at who was drafted afterwards no real candidate steps out.  That being said, we can totally shit on Ainge for taking Grant Williams over Matisse Thybulle (see above post for that whole debacle)"
"Believe me, those questions have been asked multiple times over by Celtics fans everywhere.  I think that Grant’s a legit NBA role player, but it’s undeniable that so much more was possible and instead we’re where we are now.  Ainge picked Grant at 22 but he also had the 20th pick… with which he selected Matisse Thybulle, who he then traded to Philly for picks 33 (Carsen Edwards) and 24 (Ty Jerome, who he then traded to PHO with Aaron Baynes for… a protected 1st in 2020, freeing up cap space to sign Kemba, IIRC).  In Ainge’s defense I think they thought Herro would’ve been long gone once it got anywhere near their pick at 14.  But on the whole this is indicative of how Ainge had just botched the endgame of his final attempt to assemble another championship level roster.  It all could’ve gone so differently if Hayward’s ankle hadn’t snapped off just moments into his first game.  Had that roster been intact and living up to its promise then maybe Ainge would’ve pulled the trigger on trading his many assets into tangible NBA players.  Instead he resigned last year and everyone kind of agreed that it was time (if not overdue)."

Matisse Thybulle for DPOY. He was fucking everywhere tonight.
Matisse Thybulle
"I think I saw Matisse Thybulle toss the ball 5 or 6 rows in the stands and he wasn’t ejected.   But I won’t mention that, cuz I don’t want to embarrass the league (or Cam Reddish)"
Marcus Smart is if Matisse Thybulle didn't understand his role
Passing the ball to Matisse Thybulle 🤣
"Since he plays the 4 and the 5, he's probably competing for 6 forward and centre spots with:   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Myles Turner, Clint Capela, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby and DeAndre Ayton.   Probably missed a few (Jimmy is usually a SG for these teams)."
100% deserves the [mural in Fishtown](https://www.phillyvoice.com/matisse-thybulle-fishtown-mural-sixers-red-bull-philadelphia-parks-steals/). Love seeing it each time I'm at Frankford + Girard.
Honestly maybe matisse thybulle in a triple ot game. Tonight he had 5 blocks and 4 steals in like 19 minutes
" ""He might be the best perimeter defender in the world,"" writes ESPN's Zach Lowe. ""He’s one of the best perimeter defenders I’ve ever seen. Thybulle is some sort of phantom. He doesn’t move in normal ways. He’s in one spot, and then suddenly, without warning, he’s somewhere else 15 feet away -- only not enough time has passed for any human to traverse 15 feet. Thybulle doesn’t move. He apparates.""   -Zach Lowe on Matisse"

"Harden could have fetched one Ben Simmons  and one of Thybulle/Matisse but either the Rockets owner was being petty or the 76ers owner was being greedy.  Don't know.   Looking across the league I can't think of a team that would trade for PG.  I think he would be redundant on a lot of teams that could trade for him, like Bulls or the Wizards.   Perhaps the Knicks, but I don't think they'd want to give up RJ Barrett."
"Rozier was used to get Kemba. You can do these for every GM, although yes. Some of Danny’s choices have sucked. Criticizing 2nd rounders is really stupid, almost everybody misses on them. Grant Williams doesn’t have much higher to go, but he cannot he fully evaluated. Yam Madar isn’t even allowed to play in the NBA yet. Romeo Langford is hardly a bust yet, he is like Matisse Thybulle with even less offense due to never getting a full offseason. Nesmith has looked very good last few months and has a very high ceiling. But yeah, no excuses for guys like James Young. Everybody thought he would be great, but it’s on the GM for not finding the right guy."
"Nobody showed any evidence of Beal scoring on Simmons or Thybulle multiple times. They misunderstood switching and screening and were mistakenly attributing buckets made after a screen or a switch as a bucket made on Ben or Matisse when the Matchup stats would be for whoever switched onto Beal.   You can not like the stat or how it is tracked but it is what it is. Beal had 2 points when guarded by Ben and 2 points when guarded by Matisse, according to matchup stats that I have absolutely no input on."
"Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle"
Matisse Thybulle might be one of my favorite humans ever
Matisse Thybulle is going to be a DPOY very soon
"I LOVE MATISSE THYBULLE, LOOK AT HIM GOING OVER AND UNDER THOSE SCREENS!"
"Lmao the sixers PA guy ""matisse THYBulle"""
You think he's a better defender than Matisse Thybulle?   Take off the homer glasses.
"For real. Matisse Thybulle dove for a ball and got his hand stepped on and the back of his wrist touched his fingers… in slomo I’d tell you he tore every single ligament from his fingertips to his forearm, but he’s only been out for “hand swelling and soreness” cus in real speed it happened very quick and I guess wasn’t enough to really injure"
Recently for the sixers I would say Matisse Thybulle or Shake Milton
"The fact that Matisse Thybulle is setting all time defensive records and not even talked about for the award is a fucking joke. It's like because we have DPOTY, which is a joke and might as well be a center only award, every other spot is just pure offense. Jokic being MVP is a good example although I do understand his is more about durability than overall dominance."
"While you're busy putting on your 2nd sock, Matisse Thybulle steals your first sock. And then while you stare at your bare foot in shock, he swipes the other one. Sixers sock defense is too strong."
Matisse Thybulle and Alex Caruso
He’s way better than Matisse Thybulle.
"I think Brooks is a very good wing defender, but I don't think he's better than Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Matisse Thybulle, Dort, Draymond, or Jimmy Butler.  And it's hard to label defensive positions with all the switching now. Brooks is a wing defender who just defended Steph Curry, a small guard. We've seen OG Anunoby and Draymond guard like every position."
"Matisse Thybulle should make All Def 2nd team, he’s top in deflections and steals per 36. Kid is an absolute defensive monster. Simmons should be 1st team and DPOY"

"jingling, thanks to Matisse “Steve Nash” Thybulle"
"I'm not sure how long you've been a Celtics fan, but there were three different times in recent years where he went into draft night with three 1st round picks and no roster spots for all of them. He'd be like ""what the hell am I supposed to do with Guerschon Yabusele and Ante Zizic?"" That's how he ended up sending Matisse Thybulle to Philly when Boston had the 20th pick two years ago and Desmond Bane to Memphis last year."
worse than the process sixers  theres no way you think a team with patty mills joe ingles and matisse thybulle as there best players wins 40 games
I remember when matisse thybulle was drafted they talked about his mom being dead for about 12 minutes and made an entire production out of it and then followed it all up by asking him about it as he walked off stage just let these dudes be happy about getting drafted
"Masai wanted Thybulle and Maxey, that's why Morey said no. at the time we were prepared to lose one of them in a trade but it didn't work out because we wanted to keep one of them.  And quite frankly I'm glad we didn't trade either of them, I think they're going to be much better this coming year, Maxey especially.  So losing Danny, Matisse, &amp; Maxey was a bit too much at the time. We wanted to keep one of them and it couldn't be Danny because salary."
&gt;Something just tells me that Matisse Thybulle can be the next Kobe. He is so good and probably has a huge cock.  This must be saved before he deletes it
"Yeah, if I’m the warriors I’m wondering if the shooting will transition to the pros. No secret they all played in empty gyms, but his number skyrocketed this past season. The free throw percentage worries me though that this season might have been an the exception, not the mean. Matisse Thybulle is a good example of this. He was considered a good shooter in college but has struggled to get it going in the pros. But Davion is a good ball handler and great perimeter defensive player so he will still add value day one."
"For sure.   John Wall, Matisse Thybulle, Eric Gordon, Ben Simmons and Christian Wood is winning it all."
"Rotation needs to be cut down by a lot. No need to be playing Keldon Johnson 9 mins. KD was in a bit of foul trouble vs France which can explain why he only played 20 mins, but he needs to be playing 30+ in important games going forward. One of Bam/Draymond needs to be on the floor at all times in any important game. I really don’t see the need for Lavine to be starting or even playing at all. Middleton, Holiday, and Booker are strictly better and should take over all of his minutes by the elimination stage.   The next two games for Team USA should be easy to win, so Pop should use those 2 games to get a fixed gameplay/style of play and to find the right number of players in the shortened rotation. The biggest problem is there is no identity with this team. It’s not even the lack of chemistry - it’s not like Luka played with Mike Tobey prior to the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Matisse Thybulle never played with Australia prior to the Olympics. The Nigeria team that beat Team USA in the exhibition had even fewer reps playing with each other than the US team did. It’s just that guys like Mike Tobey and Matisse Thybulle know their role.   Players like Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, Devin Booker, etc. don’t know their role on this team - it needs to be made clear to them they play defense and play more of a 3rd/4th option to KD/Lillard on offense or they get benched. That’s why it’s easier for Jrue Holiday to adjust - he already played this role with the Bucks, unlike the other stars who were #1 options on their teams. And if you don’t want to bench or threaten to bench Jayson Tatum or Zach Lavine for the entire game because they are “too good” be benched, well that’s why they won’t win."
"OG is definitely a better all round defender, long overdue for an all defensive selection although there always seems to be something random impacting his selection be it injury or media profile preferring more famous guys. I'm not arguing otherwise. I would say that i'd much prefer Thybulle to guard 1s and 2s over screens when the center is in drop coverage. Yes this is a very specific set of circumstances but its very common to see drop coverage these days and guys who can get over those screens and get back to the the guards are extremely valuable. OG is a very good screen navigator for a guy as big as he is but there are certain limitations to his body type, the same going for guys like Lebron and Kawhi these days. Amazing players for switch all schemes though.  &gt;If you read the second part of that sentence. You’d see that I said the next 50 is much more skewed to bench players. That’s around 35  I still don't really get this. Thybulle guarded the primary ball handler most of the time he was on the court, except for very specific matchups (Dame/Luka/Russ/Donovan) where Thybulle was either not playing or Philly had very specific schemes for those players which warranted the use of Ben in those matchups (for what its worth Clarkson was always more of a threat vs the 6ers than Donovan).  The Sixers played plenty of  games without Simmons (14), and those were the games where people really got to see the most out of Thybulle. Conditioning has never been an issue with him, its only his offence that limits his minutes (and foul trouble in his first year), he had plenty of games with +30 minutes played and never struggled with the load.  Joel was really good defensively this year but we also played a scheme that lets guards run wild quite a bit, Phoenix had a huge mix of coverages that were usually a lot more aggressive on ball, be it with or without Aayton. You also may want to check your facts. [Aayton was definitely closing in the majority of games](https://go.nba.com/air3).  I really don't understand what you're trying to prove here. Thybulle played amazing defence vs a whole range of guards, from all stars to bench spark plugs. He was also a wizard in the passing lanes and put had jump shooters fearing him because he can pop out of nowhere and block shots when players least expected it. The success of Philly's drop coverage schemes hinged on Dwight and Embiid not having to hedge high because Simmons/Thybulle both were fanstastic POA defenders.  Defensive teams are weird to pick because there's only 10 spots for 30 teams and realistically most teams have a few people contributing to make them successful on that end, not just 1 guy (sorry Rudy). It's very rare that 2 guards make it from one team, especially since we had multiple contributors, but its not impossible, and Matisse was clearly deserving of consideration. Whether or not he should have made it is open for debate but it wasn't some legacy selection like Kobe used to get, he's a legitimate all defensive caliber guy playing in an era thats made it harder and harder to guard aggressively through screens like he has to do. Dejounte Murray made the team playing 21 minutes a game in 2018 *because he was an outstanding defender* and Matisse just happens to fit that same mould."
"&gt;20/50s of thybulle’s most guarded players by playing time were not starters  So you're saying he mostly guarded starters...  As well as primary bench ball handlers like Burks/Clarkson/TJ  &gt; Thybulles 10 longest assignments were...  There's an availability issue here. Philly is in the East, there's less quality guards in the east.  Don't really see what the point of comparing him to OG is when OG is a forward and Thybulle is a guard. Thybulle can't guard Randle, but OG would struggle vs a guy like Fox.  &gt; I’m not impressed by someone who comes out to play defence on second tier players for only 20 minutes a game when you have two DPOY level players sharing the court  Completely gross exaggeration. Matisse played 712 minutes this year without Ben or Joel, and Philly was still elite on that end (105 DRTG).  The hardest job in the modern NBA is guarding elite ball handlers while in drop coverage. Thybulle does that better than anyone save for Jrue Holiday, and Jrue was the deserving first team guard. Philly played a scheme that demanded elite point of attack defence, or it would have crumbled like it did last year. This year thanks to Thybulle and Ben's improvements, Philly was 2nd in defence, and as opposed to normal it wasn't Embiid doing the heavy lifting.  As I mentioned I would have had no problem with Bridges making the team, but you may want to compare the %s of how those star players shot against Bridges and against Thybulle. Thybulle absolutely destroyed some of the best scoring guards in the league (Lavine 20%, Fox 36%, Booker 27%, Beal 30%), whereas Bridges who also had an elite caliber defensive center alongside him, was simply not as effective."
"Fred VanVleet, Matisse Thybulle, OG Anunoby, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid.   Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Dwight Howard.   If they brought back Korkmaz and Dwight, that would be a horrible team to face. The defence with FVV, Matisse, OG and Joel would be almost impenetrable."
"Bro, your 'facts' are using Covington playing 7 games, less than 5 minutes per game his rookie year. He played 34 total minutes, and made 4 of 11 three pointers.  You're either 9 years old and think you just hit us with some ""BEN SHAPIRO DESTROYS NBATARDS WITH FACTS AND LOGIC"" while you're talking about RoCo attempting 11 3's in 34 minutes of game time.  Thybulle took 157 3's his rookie year, so your facts are wrong. Thybulle didn't have 50% more shots, he had 1,400% more shots. Thybulle is a 33% shooter over exactly 300 attempts over his first two years, Covington shoots more than 300 3's every year, besides that rookie year you tried using as 'facts' where Roco played 34 total minutes.  Every single season RoCo has shot over 33% and that's really on double Thybulle's volume at the very least, considering he shoots at least 300 per season, and a lot more most times. So RoCo has way better efficiency, shooting 36% on 6.4 3PA and Thybulle shoots 33% on 2.3 3PA.   The efficiency, nor the volume are even close, if Thybulle was a ""RoCo type shooter"" he'd shoot triple the 3's, as RoCo's first real season (not the 34 bullshit minutes you tried to sneak in) he shot 37.4% on 6.4 3PA. Thybulle couldn't do that even if sucking Seth Curry's dick improved his shooting ability by 50% of what it currently is.  Either way, the fact that you tried to use Covington playing 34 total minutes over 7 games 'facts' (which, sure, they're technically facts, but you did it in a misleading and disingenuous way, trying to make those facts fit a narrative that they don't, because RoCo doesn't even have a full 48 minutes worth of playing time his rookie year whereas Matisse played 1300 minutes his rookie year) is pure garbage."
Matisse Thybulle
"If Ben Simmons had a gun with thirty two bullets, and he was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Trae Young, he would pass the gun to Matisse Thybulle."
"If Ben Simmons had a gun with eight bullets, and he was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Trae Young, he would pass the gun to Matisse Thybulle."
"How's this?  Sixers get:   * Bradley Beal  Wizards get:   * OG Anunoby  * 4th overall  Raptors get:   * Ben Simmons  * Tyrese Maxey  * Matisse Thybulle  * 15h overall (from Wizards)  * 28 overall, 2023, 2027 Sixers 1sts  Sixers move Ben for Beal. Instant upgrade, and worth burning future 1sts and prospects for. A core of Embiid/Beal/Harris with Danny Green, Seth Curry is filthy and actually has a chance against the Nets imo   Raptors want to win now, they get an upgrade at SF and also assets that they can use or flip for another vet.   Wizards start their rebuild right by getting an incredibly talented young SF and the 4th overall pick in exchange for their all-star."
"If Ben Simmons had a gun with two bullets, and he was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Trae Young, he would pass the gun to Matisse Thybulle."
"I think philly needs to get rid of Simmons if they wanna be a serious competitor, his contract is huge and that money can be used for some good role players, the take that embid will carry the d is simply not true matisse thybulle is prob one of the best defensive stoppers in the league rn and can most definitely help embid on d, on the other hand Simmons proved himself to lack confidence, he has not improved since his rookie season and I just don’t see his lack of shooting fitting a modern nba system"
NBA probably was like Matisse Thybulle needs clog competition for the Olympics.
"Then he isn't taking minutes off Matisse Thybulle, who plays amazing defense and - importantly - is willing to shoot."
"Matisse ""Vince Carter"" Thybulle"
Matisse Thybulle. Dude made an all defensive team coming off the bench. Does all the little things defensively in a league where offensive perimeter guys can just do whatever they want. Barring health setbacks he's just gonna keep getting better.
The greatest defender of all time Matisse Thybulle
Jrue Holiday  Zach Lavine (Jalen Green in the future that dude is cute as fuck)  Matisse Thybulle  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Serge Ibaka  Best defense in the league.. I'll take Kyrie off the bench for some insta offense he p cute
"Second half of the lottery probably?   Zion, Ja, Barrett, and Garland would be top 4.  The rest of the lottery would probably be (in some order): DeAndre Hunter, Coby White, Tyler Herro, PJ Washington, Matisse Thybulle, Cam Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Kevin Porter Jr., Jordan Poole, Rui Hachimura. Maybe throw in Gafford or Clarke or Reddish or someone else instead.  Pretty weak draft so far, looking back on it."
Lowry is a FA this offseason. He's no matisse thybulle but he can do a few things.
The money doesn’t line up there. More likely it’d be Simmons + Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle + a second round pick for Beal + Raul Neto or something like that
"I think our best case scenario is that a star demands a trade and we make a three team deal.    An example of what I mean (you can swap out different teams and players, just showing a structure):  Minnesota:  Ben Simmons  Sixers:  Dame Lillard  Blazers:  Anthony Edwards, Malik Beasley, Matisse Thybulle, Tyrese Maxey and whole bunch of Minnesota and Philadelphia draft picks  This of course assumes that the blazers/Wizards/other team are going to blow up their roster and are in asset acquisition mode."
"Okay, but shot creation is still needed. You have Matisse Thybulle, Simmons and Embiid who could easily offset the defensive decencies of Seth and CJ. That would be a pretty lethal lineup. I don’t really want Tobias Harris as number #2 though so it’s not a trade I want, but I think you’re underestimating CJs potential fit."
