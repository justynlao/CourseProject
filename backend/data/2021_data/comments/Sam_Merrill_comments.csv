I‚Äôm just here for the Sam Merrill-Malachi Flynn rematch tbh
"You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. Just look at this past two years: Ja Morant, Dylan Windler, Jarrell Brantley, Justin Wright-Foreman, Miye Oni, Malachi Flynn, Jay Scrubb, Grant Miller, Sam Merrill, all from mid-major at best programs. If Seth couldn't get enough attention at Duke University that's his own fault."
Bucks 2nd rounders are looking like steals but they havent had much play so it is hard to tell still.   Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill. Both can hit the NBA three with ease. Jordan looks like he actually has an NBA body and seems like he is going to be able to hang with the big boys.
You put that 15mpg just to eliminate the co-rotys Sam Merrill and Jordan Nwora. F you OP
Bobby Portis and Sam Merrill
Bobby Portia and rookie Sam Merrill may be up there
"I''ll do Bucks rookies.  Sam Merrill is a poor man's Luke Kennard.    Jordan Nwora is a finesse-oriented pure instant offense guy and not many forwards are like that, tough to compare him to someone.  Maybe a forward version of a poor man's Jamal Crawford?  I think Nwora needs to bring back the shake-and-bake, that totally fits him as he already has the dribble moves and the jump stop, just needs to combine them."
Luka Doncic is the poor man's Sam Merrill
Sam Merrill would never
The only other guys who could fill that slot would be Sam Merrill and Jordan Nwora since everyone else is a free agent. If any of those guys are better than DJ Wilson than by all means keep them
"The Jazz put on this long interview with Utah native Sam Merrill before the game tonight, and were like ""We really hope to see you play tonight!""  Then he gets in and this happens."
Jordan Nwora is looking solid in his limited minutes. Sam Merrill too but he has an even smaller and defined role.
but then would we be as wet about sam merrill?
Sam ‚ÄúLuka of the Mountain West‚Äù Merrill.   Mr. 60th pick standing out of the crowd.
They meant Bucks legend Sam Merrill.
Sam Merrill already got them initials no doubt Why you so mad about it???
"Don‚Äôt see the point in this really, any minutes that would go to Myles Powell should be going to Sam Merrill"
Are we ignoring Sam Merrill?
He mistook our rookie Sam Merrill for DJ Wilson tonight. I don't even know how you make that mistake. Look them up to see how similar their appearances are.
"Does the other non Zion draft picks Kira Lewis, Jaxton Hayes and NAW not have much promise? Even Sam Merrill getting some burn lol"
"Non-Bucks fan might not of caught that he confused DJ Wilson and Sam Merrill, which is just wow."
JJ Redick = Eric Bledsoe / Lamelo Ball = Thanasis Antetokounmpo / Sam Merrill = DJ Wilson  any i missed?
I had no idea who Sam Merrill was before this game. I think Marv still doesn't.
Confusing 6' 10'' DJ Wilson with short white Sam Merrill. Marv has outdone himself again.  ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Sam Merrill and a 2nd rounder is something Presti would consider
"No Holiday. No Sam Merrill. Don't give a shit, we're the best team in the NBA and we're going to fucking set the league on fire. We're going to shoot so many fucking threes that head coaches get fired, stars get fucking traded, and fans cry salty ass bitch tears of grief as Donovan dunks on their best player, Rudy Swats that fucking shit, and Bogey ascends into heaven with a stepback three. Jordan Clarkson will start his own new religion as a Filipino deity of love and vengeance as he finishes the season as both the MVP and 6MOY. Azubuike wins ROY playing garbage minutes in the 4th because we are up 20 at that point anyway. Teams forfeit in the playoffs rather than go against the Jingler or the fucking Minivan. Mike Conley and Daddy Favs become the first co-Finals MVPS as they wipe the floor with the Charlotte Hornets, while Haygood breaks his finger in game four while down 20, destroying any chances that they come back. Jazz Basketball is officially back"

Fuck it. Unleash the secret weapon  RELEASE SAM MERRILL
Sam Merrill broke the record
Wasn‚Äôt it Sam Merrill?
Sam Merrill
they really gave jordan nwora a prime sam merrill
New guy Sam Merrill introducing himself with a jumper
All this to beat Sam Merrill üò´
Sam Merrill going for 40
Sam Merrill Breakout game incoming!
"My guess:   Sam Merrill-Bryn Forbes-Pat Connaughton-Thanasis-Brook Lopez as the starters  Axel Toupane - Jordan Nwora -Mamadi Diakite as the bench.  Eight man rotation, Bucks have two open roster spots in addition to all these players being out, so lots of minutes for everyone there."
Sam Merrill about to carry us to the promise land
"The narrative about the ""haul"" the Bucks gave up is probably the most overstated thing on this sub. In reality, it will be 3 picks in the 20's for Jrue and Sam Merrill who at this juncture I would have to think hard about trading for a late 1st because of how he has looked and his contract."
"They owe 2 more picks in the late 20's and the swaps are not conveying, that was only a possibility before Giannis re-signed. Plus they got my man Sam Merrill in the trade (look him up). The narrative around this trade is ridiculous."
"The Bucks got Jrue Holiday and my man Sam Merrill for what will be 3 picks in the late 20's, so i'm not sure who Danny thinks he pulled one over on here. Now he is stuck with nothing or overpaying for Jermai Grant."
"Maybe if lamelo wasn‚Äôt a cherry picker at chino hills I would look at him as a high character player.  Shame, Sam Merrill really should be the one to win it over these other arrogant players, but unfortunately no one will look at his impact."
congrats on beating thanasis and sam merrill üòπüòπüòπ  you don‚Äôt even watch your own team ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§°ü§°ü§°
Sam Merrill
Sam Merrill
"Sam Merrill and Jordan Nwora are, to be fair, unironically good shooters. .462 and .438 from 3 respectively."
I'm surprised we haven't been hit with one after the lineups we trotted out against the Knicks and Hornets.  We started Axel Toupane and Sam Merrill against the Knicks haha
"Bobby Portis, khris Middleton, jordan Nwora, sam merrill, bryn forbes are all shooting over 42% from deep... Jrue is right at 40%. Pat and Donte are both around 38%. We got some good shooters this year"
Sam Merrill finna put the team on his back.
A bit late but we have;  Nworuto = Jordan Nwora Samsuke = Sam Merrill
No kidding. Plus our Utah State brother Sam Merrill
"Maybe he has a point, but I also think some of what he said is just so hard to apply to the NBA landscape because of how few American-born white players there are.   I went through and did a cursory count, and I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs only something like 30-35 white American-born players in the NBA (it gets a little iffy when you‚Äôre talking about someone like Sabonis who is technically white and American born, but also could easily be considered Lithuanian due to his parents). On top of that, the overwhelming majority aren‚Äôt particularly high-profile. Something tells me Rich Paul isn‚Äôt coming up with personalized pitches for Mike Muscala, Garrison Matthews, and Sam Merrill. So really, you‚Äôre probably looking at a dozen guys who are white, American-born, and high-profile-ish. At that point, the sample size is so small it‚Äôs pretty hard to say. Especially since the majority of agents are white (which is likely the bigger problem), which simply means statistically a white player is more likely going to go with a white agent.   I do agree that players, especially white players, are likely to go with same race agents. Some of that is probably related to implicit biases. Some of it is simply due to a tendency to gravitate toward the familiar (the same way the LeBron connected with and gravitated to Rich Paul)."
"sure! there's JJ Redick, Joe Harris, uh...  *checks nba.com*  Grayson Allen, Arcidiacono, Alex Caruso, Zach Collins, DiVincenzo, Ellenson, Eubanks, Kyle Guy, Hayward, Herro, Huerter, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Luke Kennard, Luke Kornet, Jake Layman, Meyers Leonard, Garrison Matthews, Dakota Mathias, TJ McConnell, Sean and Doug McDermott, Sam Merrill, Mike Muscala, Mason Plumlee, Payton Pritchard, Duncan Robinson, Matt Thomas, Dean Wade, Dylan Windler, and Cody Zeller."
Doesn‚Äôt Sam Merrill fill in some minutes now at the Guard position?
"Damn straight, Sam Merrill is a beast"
Sam Merrill!!!!!
Give us Sam Merrill
"The thing that made that trade truly insane, is that we still got the guy we wanted to get with our first round pick this last draft that we traded away (Jordan Nwora) with a second round pick we bought for cash from the Magic, and then -still- got the second round guy we were planning on picking up in Sam Merrill with our remaining own pick."
SAM MERRILL PLAYOFF TRIPLE ALERT
Sam Merrill 50% from the 3 in the playoffs. Let‚Äôs hear it for all time great Sam Merrill!
the only guy in this lineup I know is sam Merrill because he hit that record breaking 3 pointer
Sam Merrill would beat that ass
Bring in sam Merrill
Are we gonna see Nwora and Sam Merrill tonight?
Sam Merrill would never
Sam Merrill on the horizon...
Are you kidding me?! Sam Merrill played in the finals and jokic didn't. YOU TELL ME WHOS BETTER.
"Come on now, at least give them sam merrill too"
It's Sam Merrill szn bois
"I agree, you see bum G-league lineups beat good nba teams all the time. Like nwora, thanasis and Sam Merrill almost beat the knicks minus randle this year, the gap between all star and role player is a lot smaller than people think, it's just that extra 5% has such a premium.   But on any given day a team of fringe nba level guys can beat any team in the world. Especially with 3pt shooting, even elite nba guys are only 40%from 3 which is easily achievable by a lot of players. And a lot of national teams have 4 or 5 nba guys now."
Sam Merrill?
"Teague and Connaughton have been pretty bad, but honestly, there's no one on the Bucks' bench I'd rather have out there instead. Forbes? Not a good defensive option. Thanasis? Diakite? Sam Merrill? lol"
Sam Merrill will be better than Duncan Robinson ong
Paging Sam Merrill
"That seems like an overreaction. Both lost, play Sam Merrill"
"Don't worry, we have Sam Merrill"
"Did it really come down to Craig vs. Tucker for that roster spot? I don't know if there was any roster CBA shenanigans going on but Torrey Craig is easily better than Mamadi Diakite, Jordan Nwora, and Sam Merrill who were all on the roster at the time. Maybe the salaries were important though to facilitate the Tucker trade though."
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
Donte out they got no other guards üò≠ better than Sam Merrill
"Basically every young player who would only be the 15th man on a team isn‚Äôt likely to ever be much better than Thanasis (who isn‚Äôt the 15th man anyway) and almost certainly isn‚Äôt now, even if he is wildly unskilled. Even with us, we‚Äôve got two rookies who only play garbage time with him, I‚Äôd keep Nwora for sure but if we had to pick between Thanasis and Sam Merrill I‚Äôd rather have Thanasis. We also tried this last year with Dragan Bender, who was absolutely not worth a roster spot over Thanasis either.  I agree he wouldn‚Äôt be in the league without Giannis, he‚Äôd have spent the rest of his career in Greece after the Knicks cut him, but now that he‚Äôs here there‚Äôs definitely a role for him on the end of just about any NBA bench. Even among older guys who are essentially just cheerleaders, is he any worse than Jared Dudley?"
"You didn't recognise Air Mormon himself, Sam Merrill?"
Do you guys think Sam Merrill would say yes if I asked him to Sadie Hawkins?
Put in Sam Merrill coward
yall got Sam Merrill kinda balances it all out
"The players drafted by the Bucks that are on the roster are Giannis, Jordan Nwora, and Sam Merrill"
he's not even the best player on his own team. sam merrill is better and is higher on the all time rankings
Bucks got Grayson Allen for that price plus a 60th pick in Sam Merrill
Sam Merrill
"Mirotic's contract with Barcelona was for 6 years and $79 million and he signed it before Covid. Covid is why he took such a big paycut the following year. Not disagreeing with the rest of your points, but I'd still like to know about which exact players somebody's talking about when they're supposedly better than some NBA players. I think the figure is 90-95%, and not necessarily higher than 95%.  I have trouble believing that Mo Bamba would have a good career with Real Madrid, or that James Wiseman would be a whole lot better with Fenerbahce. Here's a short list of Eastern Conference players currently with contracts for 2021-22 who I don't think should be in the NBA:  1. Udonis Haslem  2. Devin Cannady (Magic)  3. Mo Bamba  4. Cassius Winston (Wizards)  5. Nick Richards (Hornets)  6. Sam Merrill (Bucks)  7. Kelan Martin (Pacers)  8. Sekou Doumbouya  9. Cory Joseph  10. Kevin Knox  11. Jabari Parker  12. Paul Reed (Sixers)  13. Sam Dekker  I'm sure there's a few more in there."
"I would argue that Kyle Anderson is better than Pat Bev. Yves Pons is on an exhibit 10 deal. Sean McDermott is currently on a two-way deal. It would be unreasonable to consider either of those players to be ""on their roster"". Xavier Tillman is mostly a Center, so he's not really a guard/forward.   I'll agree that Pat Bev is better currently than Sam Merrill, John Konchar, and Ziaire Williams, so he's better than 3/10 of the G/Fs currently on the Grizzlies roster. But now we're talking about dudes that are out of the rotation, and if they aren't playing anyway, I'd rather have youth sitting on the bench than a 33 year old dude."
milwaukee bucks legend sam merrill
"Looking at their roster on NBA.com Pat Bev is better than Kyle Anderson, John Kochar, Sean McDermott, Sam Merrill, Yves Pons, Xavier Tillman, and Ziare Williams. He‚Äôs a better role player than 7 out of 11 guards/forwards. So yes, it simply is true"
Should‚Äôve brought in Utah native himself Sam Merrill
"Yeah names and money involved are too big. If this was the Sam Merrill trade, maybe it would be voided, but not this one"
"Don‚Äôt forget Pat and Sam Merrill, real classy gentlemen."
Sam Merrill?
"[This is Sam Merrill.](https://youtu.be/ShC02_e8UbM)  He‚Äôs obviously only played in garbage time with Milwaukee, but he‚Äôs been a sharp shooter. If I remember correctly he started his NBA career 6/6 from 3 or something like that, which was kind of fun to watch."
"Dang‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre getting hate for no reason. I wouldn‚Äôt say Memphis won the trade, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as lopsided as the casual fan thinks it is. Clearly these guys have never watched Sam Merrill. He was a stud in college and looked promising in his limited minutes as a rookie. He can ball"
I'm irrationally high on Sam Merrill after he hit like 3 threes in a Milwaukee blow out
who is sam merrill? good or bucks
Just want to say in that finals series the Bucks didn‚Äôt start winning until they played Sam Merrill ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sam Merrill is also the name of a funny standup comic
"Sam Merrill was a career 42% three point shooter in college on 759 attempts and shot 45% from three on really low volume last year, he‚Äôs the real sniper in the trade   He‚Äôs also 6‚Äô5 and can run some pick and roll, awesome passer, and not totally helpless on D. Memphis won this trade IMO"
"This probably means Bane and Melton will be used more. I wish we got a future first round pick for him but considering how many picks we gave for Santi Aldama, this is not bad either. But we could have gotten a better return. We also have a huge back log when it comes to SG so trading him does clear that up.   I like Grayson. He did a lot for us. But we were not gonna pay him. I hope the best for him with Milwaukee as they won this trade.  But who's Sam Merrill?"
Sam Merrill is legit
What are we doing!? And what is even a Sam Merrill?
Sam Merrill got his team to the tourney twice*  Simmons should have been able to get LSU there.
Sam Merrill and Diakete. All of them really lol
Jeff Teague/Sam Merrill back court 2026.
"Whenever an expensive team like the Sixers trade for a second round pick, it‚Äôs almost always because second round picks don‚Äôt count against the tax so it‚Äôs an economical way to fill out the last one or two roster spots.  We saw the same thing last year when the bucks moved to acquire the picks that became Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill"
"Ehhh, Sam Merrill is a better three point shooter than Jordan, but Jordan is much better at creating his own shot and shooting from multiple angles.   I have hope that Merrill can be a sharpshooter off the bench but I can definitely see Jordan being a starter in a few years for us."
Some example are so clear and take little effort to look up. Bucks didn‚Äôt select RJ Hampton because that pick was traded. Same for KPJ.   Bucks took Sam Merrill and Jordan Nwora last year.   So many little things that are off or incorrect.
After all 3 picks and 2 swap plus Hill and Bledsoe for Jrue and Sam Merrill wasnt that bad.
You forgot to mention Mormon Luka Doncic aka Sam Merrill
Brandon Jennings was a good pick foh and jabari was a consensus number 2. And we drafted the goat Sam Merrill with pick 60 last year. And Nwora is a good second round pick. He has numerous 25+ point games and shot about 45% from 3 this year. Come on now
"Tom Chambers, John Collins, Byron Scott, and NBA Champion Sam Merrill gonna win gold for Utah /s"
His name is sam merrill duh
"Two of the three Mormons in the NBA, Sam Merrill and Elijah Bryant, play for the Bucks, and the third, Jabari Parker, was drafted by the Bucks."
"I want to say I disagree,but I dont.  TIL Sam Merrill is American."
"We run it back as much as possible and hope we play better (looking right at Jrue Holiday‚Äôs scoring). We shot 32% from three in this run, we‚Äôre not exactly replete with GOAT-tier shooting but there‚Äôs no reason that shouldn‚Äôt be minimum 35% with the guys we‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs not a huge jump but it can make all the difference in some tight playoff games.  Aside from that, the only real need we have is another bench guard. If Forbes isn‚Äôt bombing he isn‚Äôt playing, so we only have Jrue/Pat/Donte to soak up playoff minutes there and all three of those guys are prone to extreme inconsistency offensively. I don‚Äôt really know who‚Äôs available but somebody who can pass and defend a little bit to go with some shooting is a big need.  We also have our young guys who were playing garbage time. I don‚Äôt have a lot of faith in Sam Merrill to turn into much and I‚Äôm not super sold on Diakite even though the potential is clearly there but Jordan Nwora can absolutely be a top-tier bench chucker and could be vital on nights Middleton and Holiday aren‚Äôt scoring if he can work his way into the rotation next year.  It‚Äôs also worth keeping half an eye on Lopez too, he‚Äôs old as shit and he‚Äôs fading. Portis is definitely a worse defender but I wouldn‚Äôt be mad to see him starting (assuming he stays, which is a big if) and just utilising Giannis at centre lineups more when we need the rim protection, but another playable centre off the bench would be nice if Diakite isn‚Äôt it. That‚Äôs probably something that can wait for the trade deadline though."
I'd trade 1 Sam Merrill for him
"This first one will take so much pressure off the whole roster and coaching staff. We might see Jrue take another step up next playoffs, he seemed nervous at a lot of times this post season. And the Bucks have a couple promising rookies on the roster in Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill who could fill out roster depth if they take another leap over the offseason.  Things are looking up for sure! The main stars are all locked up for several years, the window is open for years. But then again we'll see if the rest of the league heals up and gives the Bucks their toughest fight, everyone wants to beat the defending champs."
I kind of hope it‚Äôs Sam Merrill because that would feel like in college when you see the quiet freshman who has never drank before just shotgunning beers left and right.
Sam Merrill I don‚Äôt need to explain myself
who tf is Sam Merrill
That‚Äôs Sam ‚Äúhit the NBA record 29th three pointer‚Äù Merrill.
Mamadi Diakite and Sam Merrill carried
The Sam Merrill disrespect has gone on too long
Think we can all agree Sam Merrill has the FMVP on lock.
"&gt;I thought the Jrue trade was great.   It would have been if it had just been that straight up, but he made it instantly worse by folding in the Steven Adams deal along with it (especially since he was already taking back a negative contract in Bledsoe).   Here is what the actual trade wound up being from the Pels side:  * **Out:** Jrue Holiday, Sam Merrill, Zylan Cheatham, Joshia Gray, Darius Miller, Kenrich Williams, a 2023 2nd round draft pick and a 2024 2nd round draft pick   * **In:** Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 1st round picks, and swap rights on Milwaukee's 2024 &amp; 2026 1sts, which most likely won't be used (and now New Orleans has had to send out one of the picks they got from the Lakers in the AD trade just to get rid of Adams and Bledsoe)  So basically they traded Jrue, two 2nds and a bunch of random players and got back two late 1st round picks and two negative value contracts they had to attach a pick to to unload. That's not very good in the aggregate."
Sam Merrill is in the game. We are going to get to see some Aldama minutes at this rate.
Sam Merrill chest lmao!
"I'll maintain my opinion: Grayson Allen for Sam Merrill, a 2nd and a free Rodgers jersey was the steal of the offseason."
"While I get this take, the 2yrs $20mil deal that prompted this thread is exactly why grizz were looking to ship him. A glut at the 2 position and looking for flexibility in the coming years has our FO gun-shy on the contracts. It's worth noting that Sam Merrill didn't get cut, and we've been trading in 2nd rd picks for value a bunch these past few years. Good on the bucks for grabbing a deal while it was available."
We gave away NBA champion Sam Merrill!
continued - [Sam Merrill and Jarrett Culver make Memphis‚Äô season-opening roster.](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1449473965345280005?s=21)
"it was a move that was too criticized for how it affected the team.    sign and trade Brogdon net us RJ Hampton, Jordan Nwora and Sam Merrill.    RJ Hampton was traded alongside George Hill, Eric Bledsoe and picks for Jrue Holiday.    not having Brogdon on the contracts (under the tax) allowed us have MLE to sign DJ Augustin and Bobby Portis.    DJ Augustin was traded for PJ Tucker.    Sam Merill was traded for Grayson Allen.    in all comes down to hindsight, but not signing Brogdon has 1) still allowed us to win a title, 2) go over the tax and have a core of Giannis-Khris-Jrue for the next ~4 years, and 3) netted us Bobby Portis, Grayson Allen, and Jordan Nwora who will all be in the rotation going forward.     on the other hand, if the Bucks had extended Brogdon, we still may win a chip in 2020 or 21 (not guaranteed obviously) but is that with Brogdon as the starting PG, or was he traded anyway for a higher tier player (could be Jrue, could be CP3)."
Is this all the roster spots sorted now? Sam Merrill safe?

NBA Champion Sam Merrill*
The most 3's Dame hit in a game last season was 8. It took Grizzlies' Sam Merrill exactly one pre-season to match it.
End of his rookie contract coming up and they've got a lot of young players to pay - that said two second round picks and Sam Merrill *really* ain't much.
"Bucks got Grayson Allen, a starting SG for a playoff with good 3-pt % for two second round Picks and Sam Merrill"
Sam Merrill looks 18-19
Sam Merrill is 25 (2020 draft)   Nikola Jokic is 26 (2014 draft)
"Probably could have gotten more than Sam Merrill who is almost out of the league and two 2nd round picks for Allen though. I was very surprised that was all Milwaukee has to give up for a proven good shooter.   If they didn‚Äôt get a better offer than that though I don‚Äôt understand why the rest of the league slept on him so hard, I barely watched Memphis and thought he was much more valuable than two 2nd round picks"
Yeah but the Grizzlies were missing Sam Merrill so it balances out
"The Grizzlies made the aforementioned trade and traded Grayson Allen for Sam Merrill and two second-round picks, which is rough.  Allen is starting, averaging 15.1 points amd shooting 42.3% from 3."
"Sam Merrill. He's a sniper, many of us Grizz fans have hoped he'd crack the rotation this season. Really hoping for the best"
Yeah but that contract was worth two seconds and Sam Merrill
Thanks Memphis!!   To think we tried to tamper to get Bogdanoviƒá when this guy was available for Sam Merrill.
"Sam ""Mountain West Luka"" Merrill!"
And Sam Merrill!
The Boston Celtics are proud to announce their new ownership group; two second round picks and Sam Merrill.
You forgot about the stormin mormon Sam merrill
The disrespect to reigning NBA champion Sam Merrill smh
Sam Merrill
Sam Merrill already exists?
"Because they got basketball legend Sam Merrill in return, duh"
"This is going to be a good tank game for Oklahoma City - SGA and Giddey will have good games, but they'll lose.  Presti needs to spend his stash of draft picks on shooters and big men though - someone like Sam Merrill would be amazingly useful for OKC."
