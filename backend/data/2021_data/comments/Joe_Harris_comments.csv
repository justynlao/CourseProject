"Joe Harris has been the best defender in our (current) starting 5 this year. Trading him for better defense makes no sense. I think KD will get better as the year goes on, his defense shows up in spurts, especially against good teams, but as of right now, Joe's been the most consistent performer"
Wait so  KD - batman  Harden - Robin  Irving - Alfred  Jeff Green - Bat girl  Joe Harris - Cat woman
"Theres more to it though... Kyrie ruined our franchise the year he was there. Durant went to a good team again so he's just doing Durant things and Harden literally threw his whole team under a bus and then joined up with this super powered Nets team making them the BIG3. I just don't respect any member of the BIG3 if I'm being honest. Its not because I just instinctually hate the Nets. I like Joe Harris, that man can ball."
"Joe Harris is the glue guy on this team, just don't let him inbound the ball in crunch time. lmao"
"Lol what a terrible suggestion. They need defense, not more shooting. They have three elite scorers and an elite shooter in Joe Harris already. Not to mention JJ redick and Hart is a dogshit return for Kyrie."
This dime is so 1000000% genius! Kudos to Harden and Steve Nash! But also for Joe Harris for giving up the ball to Harden lol
"Rooting for Malcolm to reach it again. He’s gonna end up being one of the most underrated players of all time.  Already hit 50-40-90 once. Most likely All Star this year. Quite honestly think he’ll lead (co lead w/ Sabonis) the pacers to a conference finals appearance at least. Dude won ROTY, won defensive player of the year in college. He’s done practically everything. And off the court man is a genius. Malcolm is a pure good guy. Has that organization for building wells in parts of Africa. I love that organization man, so many Africans have to walk so far just to get access to water which Americans take for granted. Build wells for them just beautiful. Joe Harris Justin Anderson Kyle Guy Garrett Temple. Tolliver. They are all involved with it, just a beautiful organization"
Which is why they have a 4th in Joe Harris lol.
"Lol holy shit you’re bad at this. “Hardens efficiency doesn’t count because I don’t like the way he scores”  We don’t care what you like, harden is just as efficient as KD this season.  This just proves you don’t watch them play lol he barely gets assists to KD and kyrie it’s usually joe Harris/Jeff/DJ. He’s leading the league in assists with 12. It’s okay if you don’t want to admit he’s good though."
Might be a good idea to trade Joe Harris for a defensive minded player on a  cheap contract for the Nets. They have enough firepower between their big 3 to get every point available.
"Yeah lol, then Harden produces an open-gym level three point shot for Joe Harris."
"From my understanding, joe Harris definitely makes it not a clear path situation.  He below the ball and the foul."
No ones mentioning that if you do all that you’re leaving Joe Harris open who is an elite three point shooter.
joe harris is money from deep.
Then you got freaking Joe Harris spotting up to give even more space.
Joe Harris
Joe harris was closer to the basket than Batum
You forgot Joe Harris.
"Of course, Joe Harris is up there"
"Plus there's Joe Harris, and he's not even just a catch and shoot guy, he can put the ball on the floor and finish at the rim pretty well too."
"Iirc was Buddy, Steph and Joe Harris. Fun year."
When there are no defenders closer to the basket than the player being fouled and the fouling player. Joe Harris was closer to the basket than Batum.
He wasn’t past the circle + Joe Harris I think was back
"  Imagine Kevin Durant getting hot. You have to focus on him. Then there’s James Harden, one of the greatest scorers of all time. You have to focus on him. Kyrie Irving, one of the most efficient players of all time. You have to focus on him too. Then, that’s not even the end. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. You have to focus on him. And then there’s, Jeff Green. He’s not gonna do anything, right??? Other than shoot over 45% from 3......  This Nets team might be as good as the 2017 Warriors."
Joe Harris learned from his mistakes and the Nets closed out a game
"Guys that isn’t clear path because joe Harris was already running back, if there is any defender that could’ve stopped a play from happening then it can’t be clear path."
That was smart of Joe Harris to give up the inbound to Harden.
lol they learned not to let joe harris take out
Joe harris getting his own rebound is stupid. GRAB A REBOUND CLIPPERS
Joe Harris shoots too much
it feels like joe harris shoots way worse and turns it over a lot if you can run him off a shot and force a dribble.  maybe that's just a small sample size from a few games this season.
KD wants joe harris to shoot every single ball he catches for 3 lol
"Joe Harris should be smashing the baddest women, better than Kris Humphries"
In all seriousness joe Harris is a top 5 catch and shoot player I’ve ever seen
KD always admonishing Joe Harris lmao
Joe Harris look like a youth pastor that wears khaki shorts and Nike shocks
"Yes, but for what?  They could trade Joe Harris for the role players they need instead."
Joe Harris
What about Jolting Joe Harris then ☺️
Joe Harris is shooting like 47% from three.
Over joe harris..... smh
Ibaka missing layups over joe harris my goodness lmao
I bet Joe Harris continually surprise opponents with his lack of common white player weaknesses
Joe Harris is like Klay without the elite defense
Sometimes Joe Harris is the third-best dude on the team I swtg
Joe harris carrying
How they leave joe harris that wide open coming out of the quarter lmao
Mfw best net is joe harris
Oof the only person even close to being able to stop him was Joe Harris :-/
Joe Harris might be the best defender on the Nets
I think kawhi and pg were switched on by either kyrie or joe Harris on every possession so far and that is just not gonna be good enough for the nets
Does he have a nickname because every time I think about him I call him Smokin Joe Harris but I don't think co-opting a legendary's boxer's nickname is accepted...
"As I said it in other reply, I just find it weird. Like it's one of the weird things Americans do that we across the pond can't really understand, like eating pancakes for breakfast. I mean it's just a foreign concept to us since we don't usually divide people by race, we do it by their nationality. Like for exemple we wouldn't ever say like oh yeah Jokić and Nowitzki are the same group they are both white. We have clear division between Luka who is a Slovene and Jokić who is a Serb. It's extremely insulting to call either of them by any other nationality since if you do that you are basically saying that their country shouldn't exist and that their nationality is fake.We will say ehh they are all ours (naši) to be smug how people from ex-yugoslavia are dominating most major sports, but we still have a clear division from Somone like Šarić who is a Croat and Nurkić who is a Bosnian. There are even people in Bosnia who will get mad at you if you call them Bosniak instead of Bosnian as one is a nationality of Muslims in Bosnia and other is an umbrella term for all people living in Bosnia.   So after that guy explained to me what you really meant was  that people view them as a white hope, I kinda got what you were trying to say, but you have to understand that they themselves wouldn't consider themselves ""white"". They would consider themselves Serbs,croats etc and then balkanites and then maybe Europeans.   I kinda need to understand that you guys have a different view on the world and I kinda foolishly made that first comment. I meant that it's unnecessary racially dividing because it has kind of a negative connotation to me. Like does it mean that white people can't be good in Basketball as black people or that white people can't root for black guys since they don't represent them? Does it mean that you can only like players of the same skin as yours or what? I am not nearly educated enough in racial Division in America so I get that this is something that Americans consider trivial, but it's kind of hard for me.   We just don't want to be part of that racial tensions in America since Somone like Jokić dosen't share almost anything culturaly with someone like Joe Harris."
"&gt; Roster's not yet finished  They just signed Norvel Pelle and Iman Shumpert. This alone should give you an indication of the ""talent"" that's available out there. They're also thinking about converting their 2-way contracts into regular ones so they can sign 2 more 2-way contracts, and are reportedly looking at their G-League affiliate for candidates.  Also people keep repeating they'll be able to solve their problems on the buyout market with their tax-MLE of $5.7M and DPE of $5.7M (which cannot be combined). Who on the projected buyout market is going to be available for such limited salary that can legitimately solve their defense and depth issues? They can't just sign a bunch of meh players either because most of their roster isn't composed of 2-way players, so they're going to have to work wonders with the $5.7M MLE and $5.7 DPE.   Given that Kyrie/Harden/KD score a combined 90-ish points, just 1 of them missing a game means that Joe Harris and Jeff Green are going to have to go nuclear.  The buyout market signings, whenever they happen, are also going to require another ""geling"" period... I'm not sure when this team is going to finish geling and actually become a finished product. It'll probably be closer to playoff time than comfortable."
"yeah 100%   I feel like Harden is used to having guys cover for him on the defensive end so he can focus on carrying the scoring. But he can’t do that on this team. Especially when he’s playing with Kyrie, who also doesn’t really play defense, and DJ who is also pretty bad.   Joe Harris is our second best defender in the starting lineup, and that’s purely because he actually puts in the effort. I love Joe.. but he shouldnt be the guy that we rely on for that. We definitely need a defensive anchor on this team. We’re missing a guy that communicates on the floor and will hold everyone accountable."

Joe Harris for Kelly Oubre
Obligatory Joe Harris appreciation for shooting 49% from 3 on 7 attempts per game
"They need to trade Joe Harris for a defensive minded big.   Harris is undeniably a good player, but with the players on that team, his value as a trade piece far exceeds his on court production."
"They will not be able to beat teams with good defence like 76ers, Celtics,The CAVS with our boy Jarret Allen its painful to watch. The Nets need a good center they Don't have get Drummond it will probably cost them Joe Harris and that would be step too far."
suns don't give up their franchise center for an injured dinwiddie who will be a free agent and joe harris
"Ok keep it real, if Harden was bought in they would be way better. The Rockets are fun, Wall is great as he was before injuries (he only lack some explosiveness at the rim), Dipo is buy in as he is in his contract year, Wood is nothing short of spectacular and I'm just wondering how is it possible that so many teams didn't tried to get him this summer, like he is just one of the most underpaid players in the league yet, the bench is awesome.  So the Rockets are on the good path to fight for the playoff this year and with all the Nets picks they should be in good position going on (remember that the Nets has 2 years span to win really, if they don't this year or next probably they would dissolve).  As for the Nets, I think that also a kid could understand that with Harden they will be shortened and with way less defense. If this trade happened without Dinwiddie out I would be somewhat ok with it, but as it is now they can't play Joe Harris and Jordan with the big three as they are too freaking weak on defense. And not like ok bad, but all time worst defense in history. Offensively you are a juggernaut but on D, where you win championship they couldn't stop anyone... if Westbrook and Adebayo shored 40 on them imagine what good offensive players could do, like an Embiid, Davis, LBJ, Giannis and so on. We will see tomorrow the Clippers game. I think the Nets are in a very bad position because as expected Harden didn't improve the team so much because KD and Kyrie were just so good and the team was working well, now it is completely unbalanced and shortened with a weak rotation. They don't have any assets to improve more and will go on to rely on free agents and maybe waivers from other teams, but if you don't look too much as a contender why a veteran will choose to play for you and not for one of the two LA teams? Or the Bucks or 76ers? So it is very difficult to look for improvement for the Nets.   The only thing that could save them is to play more together and to be more willing to sacrifice on D by the big 3. And that could not start in the PO, we saw a bad defensive team like that in the Cavs 2018-2019, they barely make through the finals in a very very weak conference, now it is a very difficult one."
"The issue is their assets at the moment are fairly limited, they pretty much only got Joe Harris. Dinwiddie is unlikely to get anything with his injury and being expiring.   The opportunity cost is also really high for the Harden trade as they could’ve much more easily built a solid and balanced team around KD, Kyrie and Allen if they used all those picks and Levert to trade for legit players.   It’s prossible they can still get to the championship and I still like the trade for them because it gives them insurance for a kyrie injury(he’s only finished 3/6 seasons) but I don’t think it’s insane to think the trade will turn out to be a mistake"
"No absolutely not a mistake for the Nets BUT this is indicative of them building a roster around those 3. It’s very possible this isn’t doable until the offseason.   Realistically, they need to try to turn some combo of guys like Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Brown into some combo of bigs who are there to defend and support the 3 stars.   Joe Harris fetched the most value back, and imo, absolutely needs to be moved for them to make any difference.   The team will continue to be good but with some offseason tweaks can become genuinely great"
Alright give Joe Harris back
That Joe Harris pass smh
"It's possible that Embiid will be the only first round pick from the draft to make an All-Star team.   Good second round though: Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Nikola Jokic, Dwight Powell (who was pretty good before his Achilles injury), Jordan Clarkson."
"Yeah. KD doesn't naturally think pass, there, though, and I think Beal can time it so he's in position by the time KD turns around with the ball. You probably prefer that to Joe Harris getting the ball with 7 on the shot clock, nothing happening and him saying, ""I dunno, I guess I'll drive, maybe?""  There's just such a lack of imagination on that play. Kyrie can't make the entry pass, so he passes to Green who tries to make the exact same entry pass."
"He was not open where he was, the wizards player was purposely allowing for the passing Lane to steal it. He might have been open if he cut, the whole bottom right was wide open. Fuck Joe Harris"
"oh no doubt. you should see my other post about him being a butter fingers. he didnt f up here. every1 knows you cut the second the inbounder gets the ball, joe harris didnt"
Man....poor Joe Harris :'(
Why was Joe Harris hurrying at the end?? They had the ball and couldve waited for everyone to get into place then run out the clock or shoot a free throw two?
That's on Joe Harris he he didnt even look at where he was throwing it. He looks down at the ball then throws it at where he assumed KD was. They had plenty of time and 2 timeouts he didnt have to rush it like that
"It's nice to see Westbrook look something other than totally cooked.   But man, remember how KD complained about all the Warriors ""beautiful basketball"" and just wanted to get the ball in the post and go to work? Part of the *point* of all the off-ball movement and shifting offensive sets is that it makes it easier to make entry passes.   On this possession, it's incredibly obvious exactly what the Nets want to do. Watch the replay and notice how Beal is able to cheat completely over off his man in the weak side corner, taking away the backdoor cut from KD. Without that, it's be trivially easy to make the over-the-top entry pass to KD going to the basket for an easy dunk.  But with the Warriors' type of offense, where KD complained about all the passing and off-ball movement, you'd have Joe Harris and Bruce Brown running a little two man game on the weak side, or maybe Joe coming up off staggered screens from Brown and Green.   So Beal couldn't cheat to the center of the lane. So Russ couldn't front that hard.   Or once the entry pass was denied, KD would pop and set a screen for the ball handler, with the goal of attacking Beal as the help defender to kick out to Harris.   Instead the team is so static, so focused on getting the ball to KD, that once that's taken away, that the play devolves into a drive from Harris, who is one of the best spot-up shooters in the league but not a particularly good driver.  People get upset about Kerr's coaching because he doesn't run enough straight pick and roll, and KD complained about it because he just wanted to get the ball in the post and go to work, but this play is a perfect example of why KD was wrong. The ""give KD what he wants"" offense resulted here in a late-shot-clock iso from a guy who is not a good iso player."
Joe Harris is my guy but what the fuck was that
Joe Harris looked like he was pumped afterwards!
"Even if I don't get Jarret Allen, i *almost* rather have Jrue than Harden. I just think a third ball handling star is little redundant, specially when you have off ball wizards like Joe Harris.  And I picked the worst case scenario on the Jrue trade. Prob they get to keep some of those assets."
"I do think the Nets are gonna get stronger, and are going to win at least one chip when all it's said and done. But I much rather have this team.  With Harden they are the best offense ever. But even with reinforcements, I don't think they can get better than 15th in defense.  Now replace Harden with with Jrue and Jarret Allen. They are rn a top 8 defense imo. And the offense doesn't fall off, they are still top 3 at the very least, and do you really need Harden when you already have two offensive superstars AND Joe Harris dropping 30 bombs??  And just like with Harden. They will get better in the offseason."
Not sure that he had time to call timeout even if he wanted to given that Joe Harris tossed the ball away so fast
Joe harris threw the game last time......
"What was Kevin Durrant doing to Joe Harris???  Guess we know who’s going to get traded cause they didn’t do what the supposed superstar wanted.  In summary that was just an awful play by Durrant, hung his teammate out in the wind 💨"
"What was Joe Harris doing? What were the *Nets* doing? Hope you bet the over cause holy cow, almost 300 points. The Nets desperately need to play some defense if they want to be successful.  This is also the second night in a row that a team has been down 5 with like 10 seconds and hit two threes to win it. That’s why you keep playing."
Or Joe Harris inbounds to KD in the corner and then runs in to receive a pass back
"Bruh.  Brooklyn put up 146 in regulation. Do you honestly think that they expected ***any*** defense whatsoever?  Like, I wouldn't blame Joe Harris if he straight up expected the ball to phase through that guy like he was Danny Phantom."
Joe Harris
joe harris still torched em for 30
Joe Harris kicking himself badly
Back to back fucked up inbound plays between Joe Harris and KD. lol
"The Nets defense has been trash when they have their guys. Harden, Kyrie, DJ, Joe Harris just can't fucking defend jack squat. They have KD out there on an island and he ain't no Darrelle Revis."
I dont think its the coach's fault.. Joe Harris literally rushed to the ball to throw it away. If he had just calmly collected the ball.. and waited a sec or two..the coach might have taken a timeout..if not..at least you still get a better chance for your teammate to break free.
"The trade only works with one of DJ, Dinwiddie or Joe Harris in it (excluding the big 3). Everyone else on the roster adds up to about 10 million (that's including Tyler Johnson and Jeff Green who will only be tradeable next month).  So realistically, only way it gets done is if the Nets trade Dinwiddie+filler for Redick just from a contracts perspective."
Yeah Joe Harris is a goddamn dumbass holy shit
Joe Harris will never live that one down. How do you choke like that LMAO.
"Why the Nets, we have Joe Harris lol"
Wow.  Insane stat...  At least three points can be attributed to Joe Harris inbounding the ball to the other team.   Was he mad about being benched last week?
"Every time I watch Joe Harris play, I swear he has one of the worst bball IQs on the team..."
Exactly and here is Joe Harris is treating the basketball like a damn hot potato smh
"Oh no, it's terrible. They have a second round ceiling as is.   I honestly have little expectations for this year, I'm more looking at next year, hoping that they can do something in the offseason to balance the roster.  Unfortunately I think you need to trade Joe Harris."
"Also, on the inbound pass for the Hail Mary 3 on the Nets' next possession, Joe Harris (or was it Brown?) stepped on the line = should have been a turnover.  You can't be missing this stuff."
"I don’t think they would’ve scored more. If Harden played, Joe Harris and Jeff Green would not have scored as much"
"He doesn't exactly fit with Nets too, basically Joe Harris' back up that can provide some spacing. (And he isn't even shooting well)"
Joe “Lil Baby” Harris
If anything it should be Joe Harris in there. But his point is still pretty valid. LeBron is going to be going up against another Juggernaut team if he makes it there again this year.
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
"We'll need to start rotating our lines like in hockey.  KD, Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ is the first line.  Shamet, Blake, Drummond, Jeff Green, Clax is the second line.  Then we need a roster expansion and our third line can be: Roberson, Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC.  Our 3rd line is defense and hustle guys.   We should do line changes after made baskets or during fast breaks.  Shamet probably drops to third line and it becomes a big deal that Bruce Brown or TLC make top 10."
People forget Baby Joe Harris was A BUCKET!!! 😤😤😤
"I think it’s how people define a superteam tbh. From my understanding, the common definition of a superteam is a team with 2 superstars and an all star, which the nets definitely have. By this definition, you can be a “superteam” and still not be the favorites if your 2 other starters are garbage by NBA standards,none of your stars play defense/bad fit and have no bench. That being said the three of them can play good enough defense when they try,DJ isn’t the worst center in the league despite his obvious weaknesses, Joe Harris is a sniper, Green and Brown have all been solid for the nets as well. It’s their championship to lose.  Btw assuming the Nets win this year and someone does jump to the Lakers like you said, any guesses? Kawhi? Curry?"
Joe Harris is older than Kyrie lol
Joe Harris isn't a bad defender
One thing you cannot debate though is that over the past two seasons Joe Harris has been the superior shooter.
Joe Harris is a positive defender.
"There is a ""Is Joe Harris Better Than Klay?"" nephew post in r/NBA anytime a Brooklyn Net appears on national TV."
"better question is, who would you rather have NOW. I think joe harris now may have more value since injury free and half the contract."
Joe harris is a way better shooter and also not close to as bad of defender while also being younger.
"If you gave both players 100 shots from the same place in an empty gym, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Joe Harris hits more than Klay.  But that's not really all that goes into shooting.  Getting open, being able to hit a range of different types of 3's, usage within an offense, etc, etc are all some of the really important things that go into one's value as a shooter.  In which case Klay has proven the superior ""shooter""."
"Klay will not be a 3/4 lol, that would be worse for a recovering Klay than playing the 2, and maybe sometimes 3.  Klay isn’t all that old and can recover to a decent level. He isn’t going to be reduced to being Joe Harris unless the injuries severely inhibit him more than they did KD.  A team with 3 guards, unless that 3rd guard is Harden, isn’t going to be a contender. I really don’t think Beal brings much in terms of making the Dubs a winner.  They need to go after a better fit that can also score, but moreso do other things like rebound, defend, or pass."
"I should've specified 3pt shooting, Klay is obviously 10x the scorer Joe Harris is"
"im a big joe harris fan, but klay is arguably the 2nd best shooter of all time."
Joe Harris career high 30 points
"Damn, really? I’ve been pretty out of the loop since last year. Assuming a healthy roster, why not put KD at 3 and Blake at 4? Is it totally obvious that Joe Harris is a better first option, keeping KD at 4?"
"&gt; and all he really brings is more scoring.  If you want to be a championship contender again, that's kinda what is necessary...  You can't compete with the Nets firepower with just Steph and what is clearly going to be a reduced Klay. Klay should be in the Joe Harris role at this stage of his career. You need another PnR ball handler besides Steph. Plus defensively, at this stage of his career, Klay is going to be more of a 3/4 than a 2/3."
"In his defence, we don't actually know if Joe Harris would be opposed to /u/humblestmanonearth changing his diapers."
I feel like he’s not a valid enough villain to thrive in the Nets- same for Joe Harris.
"But would they have wanted to come without the reclamation projects of Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and DLo (to a lesser extent) making us a playoff team? Marks def got lucky with KD but you gotta work hard to give your self a chance to get lucky."
Yeah no shit but the one time they went head to head in a 3 point contest Joe Harris won lol
Blake is not starting over Joe Harris
Damn Joe Harris has a lot of accolades huh? Seriously anyone who thinks Blake is starting hasnt watched a single Nets game this season.
Joe Harris isn’t close to Steph tho
How much help does baby joe harris need?
Baby Joe Harris
that's what i'm saying. last year it was players like buddy hield and joe harris. everyone knows how good they are at shooting. but i personally had no idea that mike conley was like that.
not really. Outside of each other the team wasn't too stacked  warriors were the most stacked team ever. All around great team that won 74 games without him. Everyone in their prime.  and now on the nets with harden/kyrie and a 50% 3 pt shooter joe harris lol. Everyone in their prime.
Would you also consider Joe Harris to be a better 3 point shooter than Klay?
Joe Harris is above 40% last 4 season  this year he's even over 50% on similar volume  So there is not really an argument to him being #2 if his percentages aren't even much better compared to pullup guys
"add Cavs too: Kyrie, Joe Harris, Shump"
Put some respeck on Joe Harris' name!
Joe Harris beat him tho
"Dude what? How is he scoring more than One of KD, Kyrie or Harden? Hell, how is he scoring more than Joe Harris?"
Joe Harris for sure
Joe Harris excluded smh
"This 3pt contest sucked tbh. Should've had actual shooters instead of stars. Need Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, Seth, etc. The guys that are actually there aren't really shooters but shot creators."
this dude lucky joe harris is not in the building.
"The supporting cast beside the Big 3 is better than you think. Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Claxton have been solid. Joe Harris is putting up some of the best shooting numbers in the league. Bruce Brown plays great defense and picks up a lot of easy buckets off cuts. Small sample size for Claxton so I won't speak on him. With the big three, Jordan, and I guess Griffin if he can still move, that's still 8-9 deep which is all you should run in playoffs. Very few teams run 10+ players every night during playoffs."
"This 3pt contest is illegitimate, Joe Harris wasn't included. Easily best 3pt shooter in the game today"
"Joe ""Automatic"" Harris from the Nets needs to represent"
Why is joe harris not in
Joe Harris
Joe harris watching from his home gym rn: hold my beard
If only Joe Harris was there.
Someone tell me why the fuck Joe Harris is not in this
"Yeah, Joe Harris blitzing these clowns"
"We need a 3 point contest of Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Doug McDermott, Wayne Ellington, and Matt Thomas"
Protect Joe over Harris ain’t nobody taking that contract
"Yeah def, forgot how big their contribution to this probably is. Dantony plus Nash and Dantony plus Harden gave us 2 very successful offenses. And now combine those 3 with fucking KD Kyrie amd Joe Harris plus a good (so far) supporting cast?   No wonder they're on pace to set an insane offensive record."
"KD chose the Nets because of Kyrie. Kyrie chose the Nets because he lived in Brooklyn as a kid. Harden chose the Nets because he knew he could get a ring with these guys. It isn’t that the Nets were so well run, almost nobody from these past teams is even here. Joe Harris? Not the same coach so clearly they didn’t give a shit about the play on the court.  The Knicks were a fucking dump and the Nets could do it. It’s that simple."
"That's true. Ben simmon's defense compared to gobert's defense is the exact same as joe harris and lebron james.   Jazz fans are brainless. If you want to use MVP as an example, use Harden vs Russ. Player that does everything well vs scorer."
"We could try giving the Defensive Player of the Year award to the guy who is the best defensive player of the year. There I go off in my fantasy world again.  I'm going to make sure to use your logic when it comes to the MVP award. I think we should give it to Joe Harris. After all, people have different roles on the team and when it comes to being a spit up shooter he is the best of the best. If we're looking at exceptional players in their role he's got to be a frontrunner, or are we just giving the trophy to whoever scores the most points?"
my man Joe Harris would like to have a word.
"Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Nic Claxton isnt really a roleplayer but he kinda fits the bill"
"Nets deserve the most credit, their previous GM literally crippled them and they drafted great with late picks and made great decisions leading to singing Kyrie and KD  They drafted Allen, Caris, got Joe Harris off waivers, signed Dinwiddie when no one wanted him, got D'Lo for a Mozgov salary dump  Nets were fucked for years and now they're the best team"
What is the Nets supporting cast?  They traded most of it si they could match salary for Harden. Joe Harris is their only really good roleplayer.
Pretty sure this is about Joe Harris and Joe Ingles
"Had the Cavs found a way to keep Joe Harris when LeBron came back to CLE, would’ve been possibly the best shooter he’s ever played with. Obviously he had Ray Allen but he was older at that time."
"Lol Joe Harris is what inspired me to look at this cuz his FT% is so bad this year, but his career difference is only .336 so he didn't make the list"
Joe Harris
you really said Joe Harris &gt; Lebron LOL
Curry = Kyrie (maybe slight edge to Steph here)  Dennis &lt; Harden  LeBron &lt; Joe Harris  AD &lt; KD  Gobert &lt; Embiid  Easy in my eyes
That’s a terrible comparison. Joe Harris would never sniff All NBA
More of going for the Joe Harris/ Klay Thompson comparison but ok...
Bruce Brown and Joe Harris underrated i guess
That’s Joe Harris...
"Joe Harris is great, but Harden is making guys like TLC, Brown, TJ and Shamet have empty gym shots so often it inflates their numbers AND gives them enough confidence to be aggressive.  These guys are playing with so much swag during this winning streak, you can tell the game feels so much easier for them."
"Sean Marks is a genius. He brought in those players from virtually out of nowhere. Like for example Joe Harris, he was a flameout from the Cavs who never played. Dinwiddie from the g-league.   He really was able to keep great talent while adding superstars"
"I'm amazed at their ability to just produce these guys. I thought it was pretty much going to be the big 3, and then Joe Harris...and the rest would be trash.  I happily admit I was wrong. Bruce Brown and Nicolas Claxton have really showed up."
True. This is the best 3 point shooting cast by far Harden has had. But Joe Harris is taking 2 more 3’s/game on a higher percentage than before the Harden trade. He’s getting these guys insane looks consistently due to his ability to break down defenses. Having Kyrie obviously helps too lol. Cant imagine how good this team will look when KD comes back for the home stretch
"Kyrie has been playing a lot more quietly these days since he became more of a shooting guard next to Harden, but he's still insanely good. With guys like Joe Harris and Bruce Brown, this team is looking really scary."
"You left out Jason Terry &amp; Dejounte Murray.  Joe Harris, and Stockton born close enough.  Marvin Williams broke the mold though."
I know Joe Harris turned it down because he’s against having the All Star game this year
"&gt;It begs a question - are Duncan Robinson, Paul George, Malik Beasley, Terry Rozier, Joe Harris less known or have they all been simply unavailable for the 3PT competition?     Joe Harris already won the 3pt competition before and has been outspoken about being against this years All-star weekend. I'm sure he got invited but declined it"
"I really don't like this award.  it always goes to guys who make a big trade and the team wins.  I wouldn't be surprised if  Sean marks wins it but what did he really do this year besides trade for harden?  one trade shouldn't be the barometer and IMO, his moves in other years were better to judge him on.  drafting levert and Jarrett Allen.  finding dinwiddie and Joe Harris.  trading for DLo.  trading for demarre Carroll AND 1st rd picks.  for where the nets were, those moves setup kyrie and KD.  I firmly believe that 95% of the GMs would have screwed that up royally in the same situation"
Does anyone know exactly how this is calculated? Joe Harris is a decent defender and no where near this bad in actual games.
mine is Joe Harris
"Yeah a late first that they would still have even if they were awful and the rockets great in 2023, 2025, and 2027. And they still have seconds available. Joe Harris and Dinwiddie were second round picks. It's not a sure thing at all that the nets will be awful in 4-5 years."
"I really can't imagine it is.  What's the success rate on a fast break layup/dunk?  80%?  And then there's a pretty sizable percentage chance of getting fouled as well for the 3 point play.  (Or recapturing the 2 even if you missed)  I feel like you'd need to hit the 3 at a 60% clip to justify it.  Joe Harris is the only guy currently hitting wide open 3's at that rate.    I think the nuanced answer is not every fast break is equal.  If Curry sees a defender or two who may contest a layup, it makes sense to take a wide open 3 instead.  But if it's a clear path it would still be dumb to not take the free 2."
True. But we are talking about KD here.  Who is a generational scorer himself. He ain't Joe Harris.  Do you honestly think KD couldn't average 36 if he had the greenlight to shoot as much as he'd like?
It’s not just a matter of “giving” someone more shots. Joe Harris shoots 48% from 3 but the nets can’t just give him every shot and have him score 140 points a game. If KD took more shots his efficiency would fall. Every advances stat agrees that that offensive season from harden was more valuable than any season KD has had
"LeBron wouldn't sign with Dolan in a salary cap because he needs a good team surrounded around him. With a $40 million LeBron contract, it takes managerial skills to build a team around him with a limited cap. But if Dolan can spend $400 million, he can put whoever he wants around LeBron by throwing money at other all-stars. Why would Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, and a great 3 point shooter like Joe Harris say, ""We'd rather not double our salaries and go play with LeBron. I'll take $30 million instead of $60 million and go to San Antonio."""
Lol no joe harris? The fuck
48.4%? Steve Kerr is the all time leader in 3 pt% at 45.4%. Joe Harris is 5th with 43.69%. Nice
Are only all stars participating in other all-star competitions? I don't see why they would have both brown and tatum in there and not at least Joe Harris
Second rounder Joe Harris?
"I hated how Harden played in Houston. Because I misjudge him as a greedy player. But damn he proved me wrong. Dude is better surrounded by better players. He's more effective as playmaker than a scorer. Having Kyrie and KD(soon) scoring for him, just unleash his playmaking. Not to mention he has the likes of Joe Harris and DJ(still a lob target) to feed. If only Nets was able to hold on to Jarrett Allen..."
Joe “Gary “Tobias “Gary “Joe “Tobias “Gary Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris” Harris”
Random? No. He was beaten by Joe Harris and Klay Thompson. Both amazing 3 point shooters.
"Gary ""Gary ""Joe “Steph “Logo “Ice Trae” Lillard” Curry” Harris"" Harris"" Harris"
"No Joe harris, so it’s anybody’s game."
Thank god no Joe harris.
Joe Harris has literally won the 3 point contest lol
How are they not gonna get my dude Joe Harris back?
&gt; They have to be there anyways so it'll help reduce spread I guess.  THis is most likely it. Hadn't Curry said before that he was not participating in the contest again? They must have told him that it was either this or making Joe Harris quarantine for a couple of rounds
"Joe Harris either at the corner or top of the key being wide open is even deadlier. its truly a pick your poison to defeat this stupid superteam. Moreover, you gotta make sure your bench holds up well against LMA &amp; Blake."
"Maybe Joe Harris. 4 yr/$75M is a nice contract, I'm guaranteed a ring or two, but I'm also not freeloading it since I'd be a valuable part of the offense.   Almost no defensive attention considering the big 3, so it's just easy catch and shoot or drives. Nothing too physically demanding, it would just feel like pickup ball"
"The sheer power of Jokic gives 2014 a good case as the best one also  NIkola Jokic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson, Glenn Robinson III. Looking at it more yeah it is better than 2012  Issue with 2nd round picks is even the guys who end up good often take years to do so and the team who drafts them doesnt think they are good and ends up dumping them. Crowder, Barton, Dinwiddie, Harris, Grant, none of these are guys who did it on the team that drafted them really."
Maybe Joe Harris.  Does double damage by getting him off BKN.
Joe Harris
Joe harris
same with joe harris more dangerous than kyrie and harden
Off the top of my head Joe harris.
"Yeah and the players will have to outplay KD, Harden, Kyrie, and Joe Harris"
That’s why our offense is so deadly. It combines great ball and man movement with elite iso play. We can play either style. If you switch everything we’ll force a bad switch for you with harden or kyrie and go to work. If not we’re gonna run pnr or bring joe Harris and Durant off screens
Minimum joe harris money
Harden dribbles behind the 3 point line and passes it to KD in the elbow who makes a few moves then passes it to Kyrie at the 3 point line who drives then passes it to a wide open Joe Harris in the corner.   Checkmate Atheists.
"Harden had 30 on 66% Ts, with covid Westbrook. And now has KD and kyrie to back him up(Along with joe Harris and other shooters)"
"Yeah it was fun to watch. No need to iso when everyone is a threat. Makes the game a lot easier when they can't overload help on 1 or 2 players. No knock on Joe Harris, but that's why he's getting buckets."
And Joe fucking Harris waiting to shooting 50% from corner 3's.
maybe? We'll see in the playoffs. Some of the Warriors teams underratedly had guys like Livingston that could score on their own without needing a creator. Not sure thats the case with Joe Harris and Jeff Green
In 2016 joe harris was not worth mentioning  ... And I love joe harris
Where’s that clown that said Joe Harris provided 80% of what steph does but at $20million
"Thad young , Saric , Marcus Morris, Joe Harris are some of the best ones rn"
you forgot joe harris
"I'm not a Pistons fans but the obligatory ""lol Pistons"" post on every Blake Griffin play is so annoying. I can't imagine how annoying it'd be if I was a fan.  People act like Blake Griffin isn't getting much easier looks now with the Nets. He's wide open during most of his highlights. That wasn't happening on the Pistons. He was posting up and isolating (and doing a poor job of it) on the Pistons. He's got open 3s, open cutting lanes, dump passes, etc from playing next to 2 top 5-10 and Kyrie who's at least top 20 this year. Also, Joe Harris who is one of the best shooters in the league.   Sure, Blake is playing better and harder now but it's not like he's anywhere near what he used to be because he gets a highlight or two. I'd even argue that he's probably not even a better player than before.. He's playing very well in a limited role on a contender. He played poorly as one of the primary options on a bad team."
"So you think KD and Kyrie joined the Nets because of cap space alone and that's it? Jared Dudley spoke at length at how well he was treated by the Nets and how they have a one of a kind staff. KD said going to the Nets was an extremely easy decision because of how they performed last year and the fact his personal surgeon who did his Achilles is on the Nets staff   The Nets went from having no draft picks in 2016, to a playoff birth in 2018. Do you think that doesn't have value?   The Nets without Harden are still easy favorites coming out of the east because of how well they drafted and developed Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen Joe Harris, Claxton and Dinwiddie"
"Yep, it's crazy the Nets got Harden without giving up Kyrie, Dinwiddie or Joe Harris"
"I wouldn’t say “from nothing.”  The Nets clearly have the advantage of being Kyrie’s boyhood team, being from New York City, and not being owned by James Dolan.    But Marks did build something.  He scooped up LeVert who was the 20 pick and picked Jarrett Allen at 22.  If those late first round picks don’t work out they don’t have the pieces to get Indy and Cleveland involved to make the Harden trade happen.  He picks up Joe Harris, who looked like a bust but is now nearly 50% from 3.  And the Nets wouldn’t be in first place without guys like Nick Claxton and Bruce Brown.  Marks has been lucky, but he’s been adept at playing the hands he was dealt."
personally I feel that the nets would have to add Joe Harris to make it a fair trade
"KD, Harden, and Kyrie are already enough as it is. They also have the #1 3 point shooter in Joe Harris right now. But then they also  have LMA, Griffin, DJ, Green, Brown, Shamet, etc. Then they also have Dinwiddie, who was averaging 21/7 last year for the Nets recovering from an ACL surgery...  On paper, this team is more stacked than the KD Warriors from top to bottom. If it was not in a weird pandemic year, and if the roster was fully healthy, their record would be much better than what it is right now. I can't believe people even think other teams have a shot at beating this team in a Finals series."
Are you trying to argue that Steph Curry is a better shooter than Joe Harris? Is that necessary lol
"There were some dumb takes but this level of fun is more than even I expected. Outside of the stars, guys like Joe Harris, Landry Shamet always keep the ball moving and fly off screens. Jeff Green just does everything and never forces it. Blake is a really good passer. Him and LMA bring some post up punch to the team. Claxton's a big ball of energy. Basically everything you'd want in an ideal offense. It's not just 3-4 guys standing around.   This is like D'Antoni's dream."
"He built the grit and grind team with smart moves like joe Harris, dinwiddie, trading for dlo, drafting Claxton and JA. That made the Nets a playoff team and a reasonable team to sign with as a FA. Then for some reason teams didn’t wanna sign James Harden, so we leveraged all that building for something new. I think he’s done a great job and deserves a lot of credit."
This play was only possible because of what he did with his eyes. What a fake. Even Joe Harris great gravity as a 3 PT shooter.
"Ummmm, replace Joe Harris with BG"
Oh for fucks sake they the 4th/5th maybe 6th option behind joe harris. Ofc they're a problem. Everyones fucked. In Kds achilles exists the only dose of hopium left in the NBA.
"Any team with harden would not have any issues with their offense.  Just have to fill the team with decent players like - Durant, Kyrie, Joe Harris, LMA, BG, Jeff Green, ..."
Joe Harris was definitely a second round pick.
"the warriors might take kd and joe harris, idk though"
"It’s crazy that they are doing this while only having Kevin Durant, Kyrie, Blake Griffin who can suddenly play again, Aldridge, Joe Harris and other solid role guys."
Joe Harris is a lot better defensively than I gave him credit for. The guy is a perfect complementary piece to the big 3.
Now imagine Harden being out there instead of Joe Harris. Jesus Christ lmao
"lol leaving joe harris wide open, of course"
"Kevin Huerter, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, TJ McConnell, Joe Harris &amp; Grayson Allen would all like a word with you."
Joe Harris just as important to the nets as any one of the big three
"I think Harden should be the 3rd option.  Harden is an incredible passer, but Kyrie is a better shooter than him.  A Harden step back three is not as efficient in an offense with KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris.  I think Jokic, Embiid, Gobert, and Bam are better"
Joe Harris
"the team outside of irving is extremely bare. there is really only one other above average contributor in joe harris. The sixers field 4 with curry, green, harris and simmons. You guys get hung up on all star status too much."
I believe it was   “why pay 45 mill for steph when you can pay 19m for 80% of Steph in Joe Harris? Playing off-ball is a luxury”
My TOP #10 2014 class as of 2020-2021  1. Jokic 2. Embiid 3. Lavine 4. J Randle 5. Clarkson 6. Capela 7. Joe Harris 8. Smart 9. A Gordon 10. TJ Warren
LMA and Blake are giga washed but Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are better than anyone on the Celtics outside their top 4
"There is data that takes collage players and ft% from 50% to 100% and it shows that for every 15% ft increment 3pt% increases somewhere in between 1-2% so basically for players shooting 90% ft they shoot less than 5% better but take in mind that there is almost no data for 90% shooters so graph realistically goes from 50% to 80% ft% and that is increment less than 4% so while there is correlation it is not strong enough, and also there are enough players above and under graph line that you basically have 40% 60% to guess if player is gonna be good shooter in nba based on 3pt% and ft%. Cause you will always have Brogdons and Middletons but you will have Ricky Rubios and Malik Monks, D roses and so on at high ft% and also Danuel House who shot good from 3pt but is in 70% on ft% also Joe Harris, Paul Milsap this season he isnt as volume of a shooter but still."
"Ok, I'm not doing ten because that's too many, but. I can't sleep so I'll give you a starting 5.  PG: **Bugs Bunny**  This may seem like a cop out, since he [apparently](https://thewordwebzine.weebly.com/sports/analytical-breakdown-of-the-space-jam-tune-squad) played point in the original space jam, but since I've never seen the movie I think I'll still do it. I'm looking for him to be a fast moving pass-first point guard in the mold of a JJ Barea or Chris Clemons; with a quick first step and good leverage on taller players. Defenders actually have to play back a bit further than they might for a taller playmaker (which they're comfortable doing because his release point is so low), which should give him the space to make some elaborate gags... sorry, *plays* and break down defense in the halfcourt.  SG: **Alan Powers**  Iconic character from the Arthur franchise Powers, better known as The [Brain](https://arthur.fandom.com/wiki/Alan_Powers), is actually one of the few characters on this list who is confirmed to be a basketball player, and an elite one a that. In the first episode of season 14 (The Wheel Deal), we see that he is a next level shooter, apparently capable of draining hundreds of free throws in a row. In the mold of a Joe Harris or a stockier Duncan Robinson, he is a *literal* bear who can be trusted to get to his spot and make the shot. Additionally, with a confirmed IQ of ~140, I think he will be an invaluable asset as a big body who can get position and make the extra pass.  SF: **Prospero** It's been a long time since I read the play, but I'm reasonably sure that Prospero was the antagonist of Shakespeare's [The Tempest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest). I'm not looking for much here, he's probably by far the worst of the starters... but since he got exiled to an island I think his magical abilities present surprising upside on a *great* contract. Hopefully his proclivity for plotting and penchant for potions translate to a sort of defensive floor general role in the mold of a slightly less evil Draymond Green.  PF: **Hobbes** Although I would be interested in what the realist philosopher could bring to the table, in the power forward position I've chosen the titular tiger from Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes."" Hobbes is a athletic freak, capable of astonishing high speed contortions and explosive acrobatics. He has unmatched straight line speed and [elite](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/05/27) agility. In the mold of a skinny Blake Griffin or even Charles Barkley type, I'm expecting a lot of activity on the boards and a good nose for putbacks. His number one asset is his motor, which as a cat is only really bested by patches of sunlight... fortunately, no NBA arenas have windows.  C: **Mr. Hyde** The alter ego of Dr. Jekyll... it's not clear to me whether the pre-game serum he takes to transform would be banned by the league, but I can't imagine it's that different from gatorade so I'll allow it. He is described as a violent, hulking figure with a disposition towards arson trampling. This is no posh fop or dainty cartoon, he is quite literally a metaphor for evil, and I think he brings a much needed raw audacity to the group, the kind of creature to impose his will on the game and ""dominate erneh."" He's definitely going to be a bit undersized, but we've seen plenty of centers who've made that work. Look for Look for him to play a Daniel Theis type role, potentially morphing back into Dr. Jekyll when he's at the three point line for the steady hand and scientists eye.   I think they fizzle out in the conference finals tbh."
"""shit, Joe Harris is wide open"""
Do you think they're more talented than the KD Warriors? imo that's a bit premature and tbh I think the Warriors had more talent  Warriors KD pre achilles &gt; Nets KD post achilles  Harden = Steph  Klay Dray &gt; Kyrie and Joe Harris
Harden has a +1.0 netrtg on the Nets. Lebron has a +15.2 netrtg this season. You’re downplaying how good the Nets are even without Durant. Kyrie Irving is averaging 28/5/6 on near 51/39/90 splits. Joe Harris shoots 48% from 3 on high volume.
"I can't describe how good his shooting and off-ball movement is, given he's the GOAT in both aspects, especially after you compare him to Joe Harris of all people lmfao, is this really the hill you're dying on.   It's like if someone asked me what's the difference between Ben Simmons' passing and BBIQ and LeBron's, it's just a hilarious comparison. Why would I spend time typing up an essay for something that should be easily understandable if they just actually watched him over the last few years?  If you don't understand why Curry is considered one of the top players, make a Reddit thread about it, I'm sure they'll humor you."
"Steph is averaging 30/5/6 on elite efficiency, nearly identical to his 15-16 MVP season. Your point about his production depending on his teammates couldn’t be more wrong.   But ofc he’s basically an overpaid, overrated Joe Harris who can’t do anything without HOF teammates."
"Shooting is obviously important, but why commit $45 mil per year to a Curry when you can have 80% of those shooting capabilities in Joe Harris at $19 mil?  As we're seeing this season, playing off-ball is a luxury. Curry can't magically increase his production while playing off-ball, because those looks depend on his teammates executing the offense."
"I’m more of an effective field goal percentage kind of guy. It rewards more skillful and talented players than those who play for the refs whistle. Kyrie is doing much better in that category because he is a more skilled player. And I would hope a player who has the ball in his hands as much as harden would get at least double digits assists with guys like Kyrie, Joe Harris and Jeff Green shooting lights out this year."
This was a game down the stretch we missed Mitch. Randle struggled in the 4th as well but we could not get any important rebounds.   I counted at least 3 times down the stretch the Nets scored off a 2nd opportunity and no one can cover for the 2nd chances Mitch usually gets us on the other end. Offensive rebounds happen but some of those was straight over top of Taj &amp; RJ down low by Joe fucking Harris. We grab one of those and it could be the difference.
"Joe Harris and Brogdon were both drafted as oldies and are key players.  At the end of the day, if he fills a position of need, team should consider him. Maybe not top 7, but afterwards you're just looking for a guy who can play 30 mins."
"There’s talk of teams throwing something in the ballpark of 4/80 at him (a-la Joe Harris, Bertans, etc.)  If it gets to that point, I’m not sure Miami matches."

"To be fair, I look at the players that played last night. Joe Harris, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot...who the fuck are these players??? I've never heard of them."
Joe Harris
"Not to that extent, there's no way jj Reddick or Joe Harris is winning euroleague mvp"
"Bertans got $80m over 5 years, not 4, so it's $16m per year. I think somewhere between that and a Joe Harris deal ($75m over 4) is more reasonable for Robinson. He's not as good as Bojan outside of shooting.   That said, here are not a lot of free agents this summer, so $80m over 4 isn't impossible. I would be surprised to see $90m though"
Joe Harris then TLC clearly
Kyrie is the best player on the court and Joe Harris is a 3 pt wizard.  Nets are more talented and should've won by &gt;10 but only won by a sketchy call at the end that showed all ball.
"Idk, I can't think of any team that's going to pay $20+ for a dude whose only skill is shooting, seeing how teams are putting much more value on players who can do a bit of everything on both ends. I think he'll get the Joe Harris contract in Miami."
"Pretty sure he was counting Joe Harris, he's their 4th best scorer"
Six if you count Joe Harris and maybe Bruce Brown at times
Offensive Rebound by Joe Harris for the game.
Fuck myself we got crashed in the boards by joe Harris and alize Johnson
"Man, I remember that random nephew on the Nets-Bulls game thread yesterday questioning why the Nets are playing Joe Harris for an extended period of time.  Sometimes, nephews just expose themselves without even knowing it."
Joe Harris is a HUSTLER
"&gt;Bertans has a better FG% than Robinson because Bertans plays with 3 top 5 offensive players in the league my guy, meanwhile Robinson is always matched against the 1st or 2nd best defender on the opposing team.  Bertans plays with three top 5 offensive players in the *league?* Lol that certainly isn’t true. You know he plays on the Wizards right? Are you sure you aren’t thinking about Joe Harris?  &gt;You're just looking at stats in basketball reference and spewing shit but you're not fooling anybody lmao  I’m sure you believe that about anybody who has an opinion you disagree with."
"Kyle Korver was underutilised during his prime. Thibodeau was obsessed with defense and the era was different. If the D Rose Bulls were thrust into the modern era, Kyle Korver would basically be a surefire starter akin to Joe Harris."
Which irrational GM going to throw too much money at this guy expecting him to change the future of their team? Realistically he should just be making a bit under Joe Harris.
"The Warriors will never trade one of Steph, Klay, and Draymond, no matter how bad Klay's contract is going to look, and if you want to compete with Steph, he's still a really good complimentary player to have on your team. Is it unfortunate that you're likely going to be paying a Joe Harris-level player max money? Sure.   If I were them, I would trade everything for Beal this offseason. Wiggins as salary, Wiseman, the Minnesota pick, and whatever else needs to be included to get that deal done.   Steph/Beal/Klay/Draymond gets you back in the game."
I don't *get* Lauri. Is he a wing or a center?   Can he shoot or not? Some nights he looks like he can. And then he can't.  Is he short kristaps?  Is he skinny KAT?  Is he tall Joe Harris?  Is he white Chris Boucher?
Am I the only one upset by Joe harris not having his minutes listed next to him?
Saying the jazz built the team around Gobert is like saying Brooklyn built their team around Joe Harris
How close is Joe Harris?
"Would you rather be #1 or 2 on a bottom rung team (maybe even with fanfare a la BI Pelicans) or would you rather be #3 or 4 on a higher up team, a la Joe Harris or Dennis Schroder"
"Will it be enough to get past Snake, Beard, Uncle Drew, Buh-lah-kay, LMA and Goat Joe Harris?"
"The Nets definitely got off too a rockier start before things got rolling. Kyrie and KD had some great games, but there was still some chemistry to be built with a lot of the rest of the team.   Jordan, for example, was disappointing early on and has since taken a lesser role to the benefit of the whole team. Joe Harris has had an opposite impact and has basically stepped up into what some hot take artists have called the “big 4”.  Additionally, you had Kyrie missing all those games for Kyrie reasons - that was a big factor in the first month. Plus those were Steve Nash’s first games in any coaching position. I know that might not seem like a huge deal, but after watching most games and a lot of interviews it really does seem like he’s improved as a coach as time has gone on (obviously it helps to have a stacked team)."
"He has the 10th best 3 point percentage in the league, and the only players who average a higher percentage with more makes are Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, and Marcus Morris. He also has a lot more to his offensive game than a typically shooter.  So I’d say he is one of the best shooters, but he does get the benefit of open looks from his team (same with Ingles, Harris, Morris, and just about every shooter)."
Joe Harris  Duncan Robinson   Joe Ingles   Buddy Hield
"I mean just going by this season 3-point shooting:  Joe Ingles- 50% on 5.5 Attempts per game Joe Harris- 48.2% on 6.7 attempts a game Duncan Robinson- 40.4% on on 8.6 attempts per game.   Huge drop off there in percentage. Just got some perspective Donovan Mitchell is shooting 40.3% on 8.6 attempts, nearly identical to Robinson and he’s been known as a chucker. So yes there’s a drop off after Ingles and Harris."
He might be a joe harris type player or a player with a kawhi type play style
"It was a surprise that Kyrie didn't shoot a single FTA, but let's not pretend like Joe Harris, 32 year old Griffin and 35 year old Aldridge are powering through contact at the rim and just not being rewarded by the refs.  Chicago rolled out a rotation including Vuc, Thad Young, Theis, Markkanen and Pat Williams. That's 5 big men who played a combined 132 minutes today, it shouldn't be a surprise that they shot a combined 16 FTA.  Meanwhile, LaVine was attacking the rim all night and for once the refs actually sent him to the line."
1. Duncan 2. Joe ingles 3. Joe Harris 4. Buddy Hield
Joe harris &gt;
Joe Harris is one of the best box out guards in the nba
"The NBA salary cap is not real. Kyrie Durant and Harden are all on max deals then Joe Harris Deandre Jordan and Spencer Dinwiddie all have big deals too.  We can make it work, I don’t understand how, but it’s definitely possible."
"Alright so you would agree that a rotation of Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Chris Chiozza is bad?"
"Wow. Mitchell is absolutely incredible. Joe Ingles is better then Joe Harris. Jordan Clarkson is a star coming off the bench. This team is incredible. By the way, they won by 46. Now obviously it’s the Magic, but beating ANY TEAM by 46 is impressive."
I'd say this is the least athletic team of players that get at least 26 min per game:  PG- Ricky Rubio  SG- Joe Harris  SF- Joe Ingles  PF- Kelly Olynyk  C- Brook Lopez

In 22 games this college season 6’7 Hyunjung Lee averaged 13.5/4/2.5 on 51/44/90 shooting splits for Davidson.  He’s currently a sleeper second round pick/might go undrafted but imo he’s the next Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Kevin Huerter type player. He has the perfect skill set to be a high impact role player.
"Two major things I think get overlooked by people who doubt the Nets.   Number One is that James Harden is an offense all by himself.. The idea there is no chemistry is a little overstated because Harden has the ability to just say I got everything and I'll get everyone their shots. And while the big 3 havent played much together, all the role players have with each guy, and there's no visible case of anyone not understanding their role, which brings me to number 2, their role players are kinda underrated.  Joe Harris you all already know and recognize what he brings  Blake Griffin is averaging 10/5/3 on 51/40/78 shooting. He serves as an additional playmaker and veteran presence that can knock down his shot.   Nicolas Claxton has been great. He's a very versatile big defensively and has really good on/off splits this season.   Bruce Brown is also a solid guy off the bench. Plays hard and solid defense and is a tremendous rebounder for a guard."
"Why the fuck is Harden being doubled, even if he rarely played with both KD/Kyrie he almost had one of them + Joe Harris lol."
Yes that is definitely equivalent to James Harden and Kyrie hell even Joe Harris would be considered a second star on a lot of teams.
"Uhh  Nets have other more important superstars on that team. If Joe Harris demands that the Nets trade Kyrie for Westbrook, say hello to Westbrook."
"The people saying Joe Harris for the Nets will be surprised. He’s a great shooter and good player over and I love him, but he’s an awful late game decision maker, can’t defend in big spots, and doesn’t have great size  Big 3 + Jeff/Blake/Clax is what it will be (pick 2)"
"If they just liked the city they’d be knicks. That clearly wasn’t just what it was about. You’re being intentionally obtuse pretty clearly.  Like I said being able to have 2 max spots while still having guys like levert, Allen, joe Harris, dinwiddie, etc didn’t happen by accident."
Jrue guards Harden   Donte guards Kyrie   Middleton guards Joe Harris   PJ guards Durant   Giannis guards Blake(or maybe Claxton)  Maybe Bud will put Giannis on Durant again we’ll see    ————  Blake guards Giannis   Durant guards Jrue   Harden guards PJ   Kyrie guards Donte   Joe Harris guards Middleton   Harden could guard Middleton also
"I think the Joe Harris statement of Harden impacting winning more than KD (more than anyone outside of Lebron) is true and the best way to put it.  KD is incredible and would beat Harden one on one. But Harden's ability to manipulate players on the court is something basically him, CP3, Jokic and Lebron do (Luka is also basically there).  Steph, KD and Giannis all impact defenses too of course but it's more just an outcome of their insane scoring ability rather than a conscious tugging of the defense."
"I never thought it was an overpay. I mean, maybe a little bit, but nothing egregious. I think people are just inherently skeptical about playing non-star players their actual value. I think there's also just an aversion to paying someone in the $15-$20 million range. Like if you're not worth more you're not a star, and if you're not a star then in theory you can find a reasonable fascimile of your role for much cheaper. But there's no reasonable facsimile for Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, or Davis Bertans. There are guys who can hit the 3, but these 3 are absolutely elite at what is quickly becoming the most important skill in the game."
Dude the guy was averaging like 16/3/4. He wasn’t even an also star that year he came off the bench. Like I don’t think having a great true shooting makes you a star or else joe harris would be one
"That's just a personnel issue. Nets have Joe Harris and Shamet who are elite 3 pt shooters. Rockets never had elite shooters, they where just misconceived as a good shooting team just because they took a lot of 3pters. The Nets offense is much more dynamic with Brown and Green feasting on the PnRs. The Harden that you see now is the same one who averaged 37 points for a season, difference is that he just doesn't have to carry the scoring load and has teammates he can depend on offense. I see people saying if he played like he is now and passed the ball more in his Houston years, they would've won. They're just outing themselves as casuals who don't actually understand basketball."
In a game with no Kyrie...or Joe Harris
"why doesnt joe harris simply make one more point? 15 as a number looks good. its like how when you turn down the volume on your tv, you set it at a number that looks nice lmao."
"add in Buddy Hield, Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris. So yeah, big ol gap between Steph and this next group"
Joe Harris has a 65.4% efg due to his 48% from 3. But he doesn’t qualify since OP set cut off at 15 ppg and Harris has 14 ppg.
Joe Harris has a higher eFG currently at 65.4%... at 14 ppg.
yea it's pretty unreliable. When you got Jamal Murray Joe Harris Mike Conley top 15 but Dort LeBron Anunoby Butler and Draymond are not even top 30 it's definitely a joke. Probably at least has half of the players wrong but at least it's right having Gobert the clear #1   And Jokic has a higher DRPM than AD lol
"He is better than barnes and Klay will have probably lost a step. I think Klay will, at least for next year, be in a Joe Harris/Duncan Roninson kinda role while Wigg will be the 2 way defender more so than having prime Klay + better Barnes. At least until they better know where Klay is health wise.  I cant imagine them not heavily checking on Klay's minutes."
Anywhere you go that talks about his upcoming contract is SLANDER. Saying Joe Harris is a much better player that can drive. When Duncan has been working hard all year to drive more and distribute so he has more space to shoot with more weapons in his arsenal.
Demar Derozan is the worst offender. At lesat Joe Harris and KD can say they are trying to keep their 3pt% up
Joe harris
"Since he entered the league MPJ is top 10 in eFG% and 4th this season. He’s basically Joe Ingles/Joe Harris but younger, taller, and more athletic. The Nuggets were smart to draft him and lucky he’s heathy"
"Yes it does, it's why players like Joe Harris and Ingles don't just shoot 15 3s a game, it's hard to get that many shots up. If they tried, their efficiency would dip.  Simple way to put it:  Average efficiency + average volume = average shooter  Average efficiency + high volume = above average shooter  High efficiency + average volume = above average shooter  High efficiency + high volume = elite shooter  It's pretty straightforward imo."
"I was referring to everything before the miscommunication as flawless, I agree he would’ve been better off not biting on the Blake pump fake, but it’s very understandable with 2 seconds on the clock. That is absolutely the right thing to do though running Joe Harris off the line. If he doesn’t commit to making him put it on the floor that’s an open 3 from a literal 50% 3-pt shooter, better to keep the drive and kick game going, especially with that little time on the shot clock.  And even if he wasn’t flawless after the miscommunication, that’s still an outstanding scramble job to turn a significant brooklyn advantage into an awkward Blake 3. Blake doesn’t brick it that hard if he’s open and comfortable, Facu clearly impacted that shot.  I’m not trying to say anything about Facu’s general defensive ability, I don’t watch the Nuggets enough to have any authority on that. I’m just saying that this is a very impressive defensive possession despite a couple mistakes. There were a  lot of potential openings for the Nets that he stopped, most guys wouldn’t even make it to Joe Harris on that one close out, and the way he recovered from that first miscommunication was amazing."
"Joe Harris rn: ""Lol should I let him live or really go off?"""
Do you think Joe Harris was fouling Jokic in this clip?
"KD told Joe Harris like ""Bruh, we don't do that here."""
"No, OP is making a joke that that’s why Joe Harris’ is leading the league in 3p%"
Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie were literally done in the league
"Yup Bertans had an amazing year last season. I think that the main three point specialists in the league (e.g., joe Harris, Bertans, or Duncan) always have a chance to have a record breaking season from three in any given season."
He’s talking about you Joe Harris.
"While you make a completely valid point, consider the following. The best offenses produce a high number of quality shooting opportunities. However, with NBA level defense, there will be several possessions in which a high quality shot cannot be produced. Someone still has to take the poorer quality shot and that job falls to the star players on the team. That’s why with high volume comes a drop in efficiency. It’s expected and it’s not necessarily bad. It’s why no one considers Joe Harris a better 3 point shooter than Steph Curry even though his percentage is higher. It’s also why Steph is such a freak, leading the league in volume and efficiency this season and in 2016. It’s unheard of."
He's not more valuable then Joe Harris or Davis Bertans and Pat Riley has to know that. He's gotta let Robinson walk if someone's throwing 20+ at him he literally just got out of bad contract purgatory like a year or 2 ago
The Joe Harris ratio
"Maybe I’m missing the point if the argument you’re making. But like... yeah no shit superstars are more valuable than specialists haha. You take signing Giannis over signing Robinson any day of the week.    However, that doesn’t mean those guys don’t deserve that money. Riley isn’t giving Robinson 20 mil because he’s got it lying around. He’s giving it to him because that’s what it take to keep him. That’s what his price is on the market.    The point of a specialist is the raise the ceiling of the guys with the ball in their hands. Look at Joe Harris for example. You know what’s hard to guard? 3 stars. You know what’s impossible to guard? 3 stars with a top 5 3pt specialist running off screens.   Whether you’re competing for a ring or just the playoffs, those types of guys make offense simple. There may be a time when it actually becomes an overpay. But while the NBA is as reliant on 3s and spacing as it currently is, the upper echelon of shooters are gonna be making $15-20 despite their other issues."
"You’re looking at the wrong part of his game. What makes players like Bertans, Duncan, and Joe Harris so valuable isn’t that they’ll give you 20pts a night with lock down D.    What makes them valuable is their ability to perform the most sought after skill in the NBA at a level that only superstars reach.    It’s easy to look at Davis and think “He doesn’t score, rebound, or pass much. Why is he getting so much money?” Because he has a skill that very very few people in the league possess. The ability to be an offensive threat as soon as you cross mid court is an extremely valuable skill. That’s why teams are dishing out the dollars for guys that won’t even make all star games.    It opens the floor to an insane degree and let’s the star players perform at their peak."
"Yeah, Joe Harris started out like that 100% but he's kept developing the dribble drive part of his game to the point where it's a real element of his game that gives teams troubles. Robinson's been in the league way for way less time than Harris so it's very possible he adds that to his game eventually too but it is a pretty significant difference in their games at the moment at least."
"Two of them joined the league at the perfect time. They both joined teams with stars that played their best inside the arc and needed someone to drag the help defender away.    Outside of the obvious superstars, those two are the best at doing just that. Same goes for Joe Harris (although he didn’t have the volume but I still haven’t seen that man miss in the 4th)"
I drink every time Joe Harris makes a reverse layup
"Joe's a better player, but I think it's a bit disingenous to compare their stats without explaining that Joe Harris plays next to far better offensive players than Robinson does. It's way easier to make your 3s when everyone in the lineup can shoot. On the other hand, the Heat's two best players, Jimmy and Bam, are both known for not being 3pt threats.  Harris himself was at 42.4% on 5.9 attempts from 3 last year, while Robinson was at 44.6% on 8.6 attempts from 3 last year. Even this year, Robinson attempts far more 3s (2.1 more) than Harris. This year is Harris' career high in 3PA at 6.4, while Duncan has back to back years of 8.6 and 8.5.  Duncan definitely has an argument as the better shooter, and with the Heat being so wrecked by COVID and the short layoff from their Finals run, it's fair to say Duncan could potentially be having a down year. The next year or two will let us know if that 44.6% on 8.6 attempts was a fluke or not. If it wasn't, there's no question about who the better shooter was.   At least as of right now, Duncan Robinson has peaked more as a shooter than Harris ever had. With that said, Harris is better at most other major categories."
I think so look at the degree of difficulty of some of Duncan’s shots. Joe Harris is much more of a stand still shooter. Duncan is like JJ where he’s flying off screens and fading but he’s 6’8 so he’s even tougher to contest. That last season was truly one of the best shooting seasons of all time better than any of klays shooting season. Rn he’s having a down year but his down year Is FORTY PERCENT from 3 and people call it a down year. That’s the caliber of shooter Duncan is
Joe Harris can do more than shoot though
"I agree BUT you know coach bud, he’s probably gonna put Giannis on joe Harris. Simmons? Kyrie dropped 37 on him while fasting."
"His shots are harder cause he likes taking bad shots. He is a well known bad shot maker. Harris defensive numbers are also more impressive considering who he plays on the court with. Robinson plays with positive defenders while Harris usually played with neutral or negative defenders. Robinson has improved and is better then previous years of course he has. He is not better or worth more then Harris at all and is still a limited player overall he does not bring a substantially large value to a team like Joe Harris does.  EDIT: here are Joe Harris stats from 2018-2020 pre Big 3: 14.1 Pts, on 49 FG% and 45% 3PT %. This year he is shooting his best, but only by under 1 % point on each category."
"Maybe u are an idiot if u think he hasn't improved, you clearly have not been watching the Heat games. Also Joe has 117 DFT while Duncan has a 113 DFT. Duncan also shoots at a higher clip and his shots are also way tougher with defenders glued to his back. Joe Harris does not face that due to the luxury of playing with the Nets Big 3 and the gravity they have."
"Duncan has higher 3 point attempts than Joe Harris tho. Also, I have watched Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson. Duncan has improved tremendously on the defensive end and you can also see it by the eye test. Duncan Robinson has a 113 DRT while Joe Harris 117 DFT. Duncan is literally the fastest player to reach 500 3s  and has been a sniper while shooting it off ball."
"Joe Harris is a net positive defender. Robinson literally got picked on for 6 straight games in the finals. He is not good on defense no matter how many idiots try and say he is. Harris is a better shooter before we got Harden, KD, and Kyrie, and he can finish around the rim and take players off the dribble. Harris is a much better overall player then Robinson currently is. By a substantial margin."
"Joe Harris is shooting 50% from the floor, 47% from 3, compared to Duncan's 44/40.8.  Joe's also a much better interior finisher.  Duncan's a good player but paying him 1.5M more than Joe just screams overpay."
"Joe Harris is a shooter, but he also can drive and finish strongly. Rebounds above his position and is solid strong defender. He's very well rounded as a player."
&gt;Duncan Robinson is a better defender and shooter than Joe Harris  Lmao
"Duncan Robinson is a better defender and shooter than Joe Harris. If you are gonna pull up Joe's shooting #s then you have to factor in that he is playing with Kyrie, KD, and Harden so he can get open shots. Duncan's shots are much more tougher imo and has to get him with defenders glued to him while having to move off ball quite a lot more than Joe Harris. Only thing Joe Harris is better than Duncan at is rim finishing."
Joe Harris is a much better player then Robinson though. He actually creates lineup versatility.
Joe Harris is making 18.5 and I don't think Brooklyn regrets that so this isn't unreasonable
"That's not what this says. This says that there were two incorrect no-calls: Joe Harris shooting foul on Jokic, and a loose ball foul by Jokic on Griffin. The Claxton one was a CNC."
Yeah when I see an outlier I never use that stat ever again. That's why RPM is trash as it has Joe Harris as the 3rd best defender in the league. Or RAPTOR-D becaus it has as Drummond as a top 20 defender in the league. Or LeBron-D as it has Larry Sanders with a top 10 season of the last decade. Or EPM-D as it has MCW as one of the best defenders in the league.
"Interesting that offensive rebounding is so much more highly correlated with overall rebounding.  Of their top 25 in total rebounding:  * 22 are among their top 30 in offensive rebounding * 11 are among their top 30 in defensive rebounding  The top 3 in defensive rebounding (Vuc, Baynes, Mozgov) aren't even in the top 30 overall. Weird to see guys like Damion Lee and Joe Harris in the top 20 in defensive rebounding."
"They don't. The way they win is to outscore the opposition. They haven't shown any defensive awareness so far. LeBron's gonna hunt for the Joe Harris/Kyrie matchup(Harden's tougher). The key is Harden who's really adjusted to his role well as more of a playmaker in the games he's played. If KD and Kyrie are locked down, he has to take over."
"Their defense is hard to judge as it overall has not been good but we usually see them start to play good defense in the 4th quarters. Coincidentally that’s when the Harden Rockets would play elite defense too, usually the other quarters were a mess   The team’s defensive stats are also nuts when Claxton is on the court. But he’s missed so much time it’s hard to say for sure if it’s good or not   Also KD and Harden are probably the best two defenders on the team (at least when it matters and they’re trying), but the two have played like 8 games together.   I think the Nets are far from an elite defensive team, but they aren’t as bad you or others are making them out to be. And with the level of expected offense from a Kyrie Harden KD and Joe Harris line up, it wouldn’t be crazy at all if an average defense was enough to win   Tho AD and Lebron might be able to score in the paint at will, those two are probably top 4 in the league at inside scoring (Giannis and Zion) but the Lakers probably won’t be able to keep up with the Nets fire power. Their shooting is pretty mediocre at best"
"Hmmm. I see your question. If we are assuming at full health, and if we are not including an all out super star, you ideally want a star/extremely good role player who can space the floor to complement your duo.   A healthy Klay Thompspn brings all time great shooting and good perimeter defense to a team. You could plug him into any dynamic duo, and he will seamlessly fit in as the third wheel. He does not need to be ball dominant. He can get hot quickly. Tremendous off ball movement and great hustle.    If we are assuming full health right now? I would probably want Joe Harris or Bojan Bogdanovic. They bring elite shooting and good scoring. But I don't think they can be a 2nd option night in, and night out every night."
Skill boost: Kyrie Irving - imagine Kyrie somehow being even more skilled!  Athleticism boost: Joe Harris - defensively he can be a liability due to his lack of athleticism  3 inch size boost: Kevin Durant - the thought of KD being the same player but 3 inches taller is frightening
"Having another star and basically minimum players is not stacked. Without all 3 stars their depth is really bad. They have to start guys like DeAndre Jordan who is washed up, minimum player Jeff Green, minimum player Bruce Brown, TLC, Tyler Johnson. Joe Harris is a great spot up shooter but his defense is terrible and can’t do much else. With only 2 Stars the Nets are not stacked at all"
"Hardens gravity, wait nvm he's barely played with him  Kyries gravity, and when Kyrie's not playing it's because of Joe Harris' gravity"
"He's a reddit star along with Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, basically any one who suburbia relates to"
"Playing with Harden, Kyrie, and Joe Harris will definitely show how reliable he is in the playoffs, lol"
Shouts out to the complete dismissal of homegrown talent like Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris and building a top team with zero draft assets after complete mismanagement.
"I know he shoots a higher percentage - but you also can’t deny Dame takes a lot more difficult, contested shots off the dribble from a lot deeper. And for what it’s worth, Dame is a significantly better free throw shooter than Klay. In fact, klay’s free throw percentage is very low as far as GOAT shooters go. His speciality is and always will be spot-up shooting and catch and shoot.  It’s not that cut and dry. If you just want to go by percentage you have to start throwing people like Joe Harris into the mix. “Best shooter” can mean a lot of different things. That’s why Steph being so obviously the best ever is even more impressive."
"You obviously just want to ignore my comment now. But where in the world are you getting that Steph is the first player in history to lead the league in scoring and efficiency?  This year he’s 19th in TS% among qualified players. Of the guys ahead of him, Joe Ingles, Gobert, Allen, Holmes, Bridges and Harris are all respectably high volume. And both Porter Jr and Durant are very high volume scorers. How is Steph under any reasonable qualifications leading the league in efficiency? And both Zion and Jokic are less than 1% behind Steph.  And Steph is in no way the first person to do this. It’s also not even certain he will end the year as 1st and 19th. But anyway, Durant led the league in scoring in 2013-14 and was 7th in TS%. And 2011-12 he led the league in scoring and was 13th in TS%. Shaq in 99-00 led the league in scoring and was 12th in TS%. Michael Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times and finished as high as 6th in TS%, with several other finishes in the top 15.  Steph’s volume and efficiency is absolutely incredible, but I don’t know where you’re getting these apparently fake stats from."
Joe harris is alive?
"Nuggets announcers talking about Joe Harris: ""he gave him(MPJ) a lot of room to land and still knocked him(MPJ) down.""  *MPJ finishes the shot standing up*"
I'm not sure when the chinease research chemicals wore off but I'm gonna need Joe and Shamet to be injected with another dose cos their shooting has been absolute dumpster juice lately!   Harden can't fix the fact that Joe Harris and Shamet Laundry forgot how to shoot the ball
get Joe Harris some help smh
"I added nuance, you just dont have an answer for the drop coverage leading to the open threes/midrange Embid will give up.  You baselessly said Claxton wont play in the playoffs and said he woulndt see the floor with Aldridge even though he played the very first night Aldridge got there and DAJ had a DNP. You think Joe Harris will only play 10-12 min a game in the playoffs LOL. You think a team with better shooters than Harden's previous Rockets has worse spacing despite the Rockets also having no off ball movement lmao(two of those shooters being KD and Kyrie LOL) because teams wont collapse on Harden which is bullshit LOL.   Despite having only two guys who can guard him(one of which is an offensive liability in Thybulle).Danny Green cant guard Harden and Thybulle will not see the floor because he's terrible offensively(51 TS% this year). Also Philly is going to have fun hiding Seth curry.  You said Harden couldnt beat a team with a great rim protector despite Harden beating Utah twice. The second time  it cost them 2 games trying to implement their strategy to stop Harden. You also tout bullshit narratives about KD and Harden despite them playing together previously and wanting to play together now.  You see this team as the Clippers despite being vastly more talented.   Oh and btw one more thing you were wrong about, Curry's efficiency was never lowered playing with Durant, he had the highest TS% of his career playing with Durant. So that's another thing you were wrong about.  &gt;For the final time, regular season doesn't mean anything. Harden always manufactures regular season wins  2 WCF appearances. One of which took your team to 7 Games and would have beaten you had Chris Paul been there. Check Harden's last three playoffs if you think he doesnt generate wins. And name me another superstar in the Western Conference who's had more success than Harden in the playoffs besides the Rockets while the Warriors were around. You are so full of it bro."
Spencer Dinwiddie  Joe Harris  Demarre Carroll  Allen Crabbe  D'Angelo Russell
"&gt;No, he won’t. He won’t leave home in the paint. He has 4 switchable defenders in front of him who are athletic and lanky enough to rotate. He literally has the perfect setup to not leave the paint.  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes.  Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.   &gt;Again...4 switchable defenders. The Harden paradigm of driving around a screen and bullying to the hoop doesn’t work if the rim defender stays home. Embiid is not going to allow a lot of easy Harden layups or lobs. And kicking out works well if you pull an extra defender. This usually happens when he pulls both defenders on a pick and roll and another defender rotates to stop the lob. If both defenders don’t go after him and stay home, it forces him into resetting the defense, shooting mid range, or giving it out to Kyrie or KD to iso.  Lmao and if one of Harris or Thybulle are in there, either there offense suffers or there defense suffers. Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  &gt;That’s not the lineup bud. Harris was moved to the bench and is only getting because one of the big 3 has been out at all times (minus 2 games). With all of the big 3 there and playing 40+ minutes, Harris will get 10-12 rotation minutes a game in the small ball lineup with KD at 4. Don’t get me wrong that’s a great offensive lineup and unlike KD, Harden and Kyrie stationary at the 3 point line, Harris forces rotations and creates spacing. They’re better off with him in the lineup. But they’ll be playing DAJ, who is negative spacing and can’t move or defend. They’ll be playing Blake who can’t move or defend. They’ll be playing Kyrie who can definitely hit a 3 but won’t be moving off ball and doesn’t defend. KD hasn’t had any significant off ball movement since his first year in Golden State, and he no longer puts in a defensive effort. Harden doesn’t move off ball and hits 3’s at a much lower clip than KD or Kyrie.  Joe Harris is not getting 10-12 minutes a game in the playoffs, you are dreaming.  Go check how many minutes he's played while the big three has played together. KD and Kyrie also move way more without the ball than you are implying here.  DAJ is not getting many minutes in the playoffs. Claxton is. And the 5 provides vertical spacing.  Blake can hit the three though and can roll to the rim. Kyrie does move off ball. KD does move off ball, this straight non sense which is saying you havent watched the Nets this year. Same with Harden, if the situation arises he can move off ball.   &gt;ust because a few people can hit 3’s doesn’t mean you have spacing. The Rockets had good spacing because teams collapsed on Harden in the key and they had these turrets, even if they had minimal off ball movement. But when Harden played teams (like the Spurs before Duncan was too old) with good rim protection, they didn’t collapse on him and he had a hard time getting them good looks just by kicking out. Hell, he struggled this way against the Clippers and they were never a contender. The Warriors didn’t have great rim protection, we kind of did it by committee with Dray and KD, so we had to be very rotation heavy and he got his squad good looks from 3. Embiid is one of the best rim protectors in basketball, that’s a problem for Harden because he’s not pulling extra defenders onto himself for kick outs. And that is rough because, again, no off ball movement. Kyrie and KD aren’t running around screens to get open for catch and shoot 3’s. Joe Harris is great at this, but Harden took his roster spot and will have his minutes in the playoffs when KD and everyone is back.  Yes it is, that's literally what spacing is, what are you talking about.  We had decent  spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s.  That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team.  Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol.   Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.   &gt;Fit matters. They’re not a fit because they got regular season wins. The 2004 Lakers is an equal level of dominant talent and lazily glided their way to 56 wins, the #2 seed, and they stomped the #1 seed in the playoffs. The Pistons fought and clawed for 54 wins, the #3 seed, and getting through the east was brutal. When they got to the finals, they beat up on the Shaq/Kobe/Payton/Malone Lakers. The defensive team with chemistry and fit beat the superior talent, and it wasn’t close. You don’t want to face the realities of this and every argument you’re making only makes sense when you ignore context. Kyrie and Harden have real flaws in their game. There’s a reason Harden has struggled his whole career in the playoffs. There’s a reason Kyrie failed to be a #1 guy even when he had a great supporting cast, coach and culture. KD’s game has very few weaknesses but he can’t beat a good team alone. Harden/CP3 is a much better fit than Harden/Kyrie, and there’s not enough touches per game for 3 ball dominant stars. Harden/Westbrook didn’t work with a full squad of 3&amp;Ds. Now there’s no D, only 3’s, and not enough looks to go around or a good enough offensive set to get really good looks.   &gt;   &gt;Now watch them drop a game or two to someone they should sweep and then watch them get embarrassed by the Sixers or even another team.  This is lazy take bro. This is essentially ""there is only one ball"""
you’re not wrong but you gotta throw in 72 straight games with no break and then the typical playoff intensity just without huge roaring crowds. I don’t think the numerous shooting sprees we see now will be too sustainable the deeper we go into the playoffs. I don’t think joe harris will be shooting 50/50/70 like he was at the start and etc. fatigue gets to ya.
"Nets have played 27.  In order of total minutes: Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, James Harden, Landry Shamet, DeAndre Jordan, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Kevin Durant, Tyler Johnson, Nicolas Claxton, Blake Griffin, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Chris Chiozza, Taurean Prince, Reggie Perry, Alize Johnson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mike James, Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Roberson, Norvel Pelle, Tyler Cook, Rodions Kurucs, Iman Shumpert, Noah Vonleh"
"&gt; Embiid at some point will have to come out on the perimeter and will get torched there and on drop coverage.  No, he won’t.  He won’t leave home in the paint.  He has 4 switchable defenders in front of him who are athletic and lanky enough to rotate.  He literally has the perfect setup to not leave the paint.  &gt; He can just sit there and hit open hit open threes if Kyrie and KD can pass well enough which they can.  Again...4 switchable defenders.  The Harden paradigm of driving around a screen and bullying to the hoop doesn’t work if the rim defender stays home.  Embiid is not going to allow a lot of easy Harden layups or lobs.  And kicking out works well if you pull an extra defender.  This usually happens when he pulls both defenders on a pick and roll and another defender rotates to stop the lob.  If both defenders don’t go after him and stay home, it forces him into resetting the defense, shooting mid range, or giving it out to Kyrie or KD to iso.  &gt; Lol, yeah Harden, Kyrie, KD, Harris+ whoever, horrible spacing.  That’s not the lineup bud.  Harris was moved to the bench and is only getting because one of the big 3 has been out at all times (minus 2 games).  With all of the big 3 there and playing 40+ minutes, Harris will get 10-12 rotation minutes a game in the small ball lineup with KD at 4.  Don’t get me wrong that’s a great offensive lineup and unlike KD, Harden and Kyrie stationary at the 3 point line, Harris forces rotations and creates spacing.  They’re better off with him in the lineup.  But they’ll be playing DAJ, who is negative spacing and can’t move or defend.  They’ll be playing Blake who can’t move or defend.  They’ll be playing Kyrie who can definitely hit a 3 but won’t be moving off ball and doesn’t defend.  KD hasn’t had any significant off ball movement since his first year in Golden State, and he no longer puts in a defensive effort.  Harden doesn’t move off ball and hits 3’s at a much lower clip than KD or Kyrie.  Just because a few people can hit 3’s doesn’t mean you have spacing.  The Rockets had good spacing because teams collapsed on Harden in the key and they had these turrets, even if they had minimal off ball movement.  But when Harden played teams (like the Spurs before Duncan was too old) with good rim protection, they didn’t collapse on him and he had a hard time getting them good looks just by kicking out.  Hell, he struggled this way against the Clippers and they were never a contender.  The Warriors didn’t have great rim protection, we kind of did it by committee with Dray and KD, so we had to be very rotation heavy and he got his squad good looks from 3.  Embiid is one of the best rim protectors in basketball, that’s a problem for Harden because he’s not pulling extra defenders onto himself for kick outs.  And that is rough because, again, no off ball movement.  Kyrie and KD aren’t running around screens to get open for catch and shoot 3’s.  Joe Harris is great at this, but Harden took his roster spot and will have his minutes in the playoffs when KD and everyone is back.  Fit matters.

The 2004 Lakers is an equal level of dominant talent and lazily glided their way to 56 wins, the #2 seed, and they stomped the #1 seed in the playoffs.

"&gt; blocks  Yes, he doesn't need to be the 1st option anymore and can play D with more energy.  &gt; ORBs  Yes, he doesn't need to be the 1st option anymore and can contend down low for the rebound.  &gt; stop hanging out on the perimeter  Yes, he doesn't need to the 1st option anymore and can space the floor when he's playing alongside better shooters like KD, Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, Green, Spencer, and Shamet."
Harden will have the ball in his hands more than Kyrie bcuz he is the point guard. That doesn’t make him the 2nd best player on the team or 1st option. I got the Lakers winning the championship. Joe Harris doesn’t have to choke and Harden needs to be be the third option and not choke  if the Nets want to make the Finals. Other guys aren’t that important in the playoffs if u don’t count Harris as a role player. That’s just a combined ~ 84 minutes of 240 minutes available minutes for 3 to 4 players if the Nets decide to have a 7 or 8 man rotation.
"He averages 6 assists for a score first mentality type of guard. I don't think it gets better than that, Kyrie is a pretty good playmaker, but if you want the best of Kyrie, its gonna be his scoring not his passing skills. Also one of the reasons for Nets losing 4 in a row is because some of the bench players have been kind of under performing in Joe Harris and Landry Shamet. Harden needs to come back, he is our best playmaker and when Shamet and Harris plays with him, their scoring takes a huge boost."
"No, he doesn’t.  Very few people are capable of fitting into any offensive system.  Harden IS the system.  He’s not running a motion offense, he’s not running triangle sets.  He’s running pick and rolls and hunting for mismatches.  If he gives up the ball it’s for an immediate shot/layup/dunk or because he got stuck.  When it’s not his “turn” to run the offense he stands at the 3 point line without moving as a “spacer”, which is better than what he did with CP3 and RWB in Houston where he routinely didn’t make it past half court for those possessions and let them play 4v5.  Kevin Durant can fit into any system because he’s capable of moving off ball, hitting set shots, playing iso ball, hitting open players when he attracts too much defensive attention, and playing elite defense.  Harden does not put in a defensive effort and does not move off ball.  If you think a player can fit into any system just because they have a high bbiq, I’ll refer you to Rondo clashing with Rick Carlisle’s system in Dallas.  Rondo is one of the 5 sharpest basketball minds in the NBA, and he was so such a bad fit that he legitimately gave up on his team, embarrassed himself and fucked over his own reputation.  Harden plays well when his floor is spaced by other shooters, especially those who move off ball well, and a good big man for pick and roll screens capable of being a heavy alley oop threat.  He has a geriatric Blake Griffin and DAJ, and the best floor spacer (Joe Harris) is who he replaced in the starting lineup when he got there.  He is not a good fit where he is and he’d be a slightly worse fit with the Warriors.  People are being tricked into thinking it’s an okay fit because, as usual, he’s winning regular season games.  The big 3 over there haven’t played together (literally two games) and they’re expected to roll over the Sixers?  Fit and matchup matter, and I’m glad the dubs didn’t get him.  I’d much rather wait a year and have Klay, who isn’t as good as Harden but a much better fit."
Shaq also said Joe Harris is more important than James Harden. He says a lot of things.
"Allen Iverson was a phenomenal passer, Kyrie is decent.  KD is actually a much better passer than Kyrie.  I love Kyrie’s iso game and he has the prettiest and most complete layup package ever, but his passing is mostly him getting stuck when help defense comes and trying to dump off to someone.  He doesn’t get a ton of assists and when he does look to get assists he racks up a LOT of turnovers.  Durant, for a guy of his usage, does not turn the ball over a lot and assist numbers actually look significantly better than Kyrie’s given context.  Kyrie was best as LeBron’s sidekick.  An elite iso scorer who could give a great player plays off.  He’d be solid next to Harden if it was just them and a bunch of 3 and D guys, but instead they moved Joe Harris the sniper to the bench and have DAJ/Griffin contributing to the complete lack of spacing.  They’re going to run into a Sixers packed key in the playoffs with Simmons and Thybulle contesting 3’s and blocking passing lanes, and they’re going to struggle epically.  Then the ghost of DeAndre Jordan will get laughably bullied by Embiid."
Shaq probably has an easier time giving recognition to players like Joe Harris cause they won't ever be compared together.
"I get the point shaq is trying to make, you can't win a championship without excellent role palyers, but that doesn't make Joe Harris more important than James Harden."
"He is the number 1 hottest three point shooter currently. But that does not mean he is the best three point shooter in the league, the same way Joe Harris wasn’t the best shooter when he was shooting 50% for half the year or Ingles wasn’t the best shooter when he was shooting like 60% for a month or something.  You should do some research on the term recency bias"
Joe Harris is obviously more important than harden
"Meanwhile, Shaq: ""Joe Harris is the most important player for the Nets."""
"Obviously Nets most important player, Joe Harris didn't show up tonight   /s"
Does Joe Harris have a podcast? Feels like every white dude 3pt specialist has one
And some people were asking why Joe Harris is necessary.
Joe Harris got a rebound with 2.9 seconds left and just stood there lol
"Wtf, Is there Joe Harris super star in the league I’m not aware of??"
Richerson just got cooked by Joe Harris in a iso smh
Joe Harris is an absolute snack
&gt; Harris DJ Bruce brown Clayton shamed will get their dunks/open jumpers as is.   No they won't and they pretty clearly don't. Joe Harris with James Harden as the primary facilitator is a much bigger offensive threat compared to Joe Harris with KD/Kyrie as the primary facilitator.  The same is true for Claxton and Brown as well. Harden is flat out a much better pick and roll player than KD/Kyrie and that's where those two thrive.
Joe Harris makes a living off of his three point percentage. Can’t be Messing with his bank account
Holy shit he actually made a shot.  Joe bum ass harris
What the fuck? Joe Harris over Harden?
"bro how can you be an analyst on inside the nba and think joe harris is more important than james harden, he's their best playmaker and facilitates their offense. without him they'd be clippers east."
"I mean, yeah, KD can get his shot off versus pretty much anyone, but doubling him still bothers him significantly -- there's a reason why his playoff numbers on the Warriors (w/ all time spacing) were very good whereas his playoff numbers in OKC (w/ no spacing) were poor for what he put up in the regular season. Nets had some spacing (Jeff Green was scorching hot, you have to respect Harden/Joe Harris regardless of their shooting numbers) but you could still definitely try to rotate over.  As far as the shooting threat goes, most of the players you double are pretty big shooting threats, because they are very good players. You gotta stay disciplined in your rotations and prevent the pass back to Durant, sure, but it's better than letting him shoot over Tucker/Middleton or blow by Brook Lopez on the switch for the 10th time in a row.  Not taking anything from what KD did though -- man was possessed last night."
"I mean we saw Joe Harris a fraud lol.   Best record? Like I and many others said, y'all are a regular season team. It's been known. Pretender  Have fun with Rudy when Mitchell decides he's done with a guy who gets 200M and can't guard a player or has any post moves or any offensive game really and goes to a real team"
If like 5 of those dimes result in Joe Harris getting out of his shooting slump I’ll be happy
You lost a 3 v 5 with injured harden and playoff joe harris but I still somehow agree. This was much worse.
"I mean, probably Ben still for the raw potential. Love me some Danny and think he's a pros pro, but you can cop a Duncan Rob or a Joe Harris off the market plus a defender or 2 to help make up the difference.   Ben even though is stuck in the mud offensively and a meme, he is still a star. If he can increase his fts just to at least near Brons (high 60s/low 70s) and be more decisive when it comes to calling his own number he'll be a superstar."
40 is good but 36 is like league average. Still definitely better than Ben but still not who you want to be your main shooter. Joe Harris would honestly be a good fit for y'all
Joe Harris played to his new average which seems to be about 7 points on 3/12 shooting.
Joe Harris
"those posts were under the assumption Harden wasn’t playing and Joe Harris would at least be average tbf, both of those dudes played like ass and the Bucks could’ve won it even with Durants performance, you can see clear moments where Giannis chokes on the block and doing pull ups, and where Bud doesn’t make the right adjustments defensively"
it would’ve been totally unfair if he somehow stayed in Brooklyn all these years instead of Joe Harris but I’m happy he still has a shot at the title in Utah..a lot of people said he wont make it in the league and dude steadily became one of the deadliest snipers in the league
If harden even gets to 75% you might be right. At some point joe Harris will start hitting shots and you know KD realizes this is his chance to rewrite his legacy that he NEEDS a super team to win. If he wins it all with 1 leg harden he’s literally the undisputed best player in the world.
"Sets do not work if you have Giannis and Jrue. The other team simply ignores those two, show some helpful defense to the shooter or ball-handler and break set plays.  Its much easier to come up with set play when your ball handler is Harden and KD-Joe Harris are coming for Spanish p&amp;r. Now you need to respect all 3 players plus the corner shooters. This or most other sets does not work like that for Bucks."
"well yeah. and culture isnt defined because of this 1 game. kd had a lot of hands on the ball that game because kyrie is injured, harden is one legged, joe harris cant seem to make his shots. why would they not give the ball to somebody who is hot and at his best unguardable? if they were complete their basketball identity would show which is find the guy with the an open shot/best% shot or find mismatches with the big 3. Im a KD fan but the nets team basketball this season really impressed me."
"The nets winning the championship being carried by Jeff Green, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris while their big 3 are all injured would be pretty hilarious."
"That’s not fair, man. He can also stand around and guard Joe Harris in the corner."
"I do think the Nets will win. The mental edge the Nets have is huge compared to the Bucks who are getting clowned hard   Plus you hope Harden will be slightly better next game. And you expect Joe Harris’ slump to end.   Though it’s still on the road, so it’ll be tough"
"How can you compare this to the clippers? The bucks just had the most pathetic performance I’ve seen from a team in years. From the top to bottom it was an absolute mess.   The coach doesn’t make any adjustments or have a gameplan, Giannis is running into 5 people over and over again, taking fadeaways in the post and not demanding the ball when Joe Harris is guarding him, Brook Lopez is shooting threes with Mike James on him and nobody was repeatedly attacking Harden on offense. Don’t even get me started on Giannis dropping a handoff pass and not guarding Durant."
"I can see a future where the Nets rest both Harden and KD next game to avoid injuries, and the Bucks still lose to Joe Harris and Blake Griffin scoring 30+. That team looks like the Clippers in the East now, like they know they're out even when they're leading."
"You mean Top 3 SF ever.      The Bucks are basically healthy. Nets have a dead flat-earther, a broken Strip club savant, Joe "" can't even hit the rim anymore"" Harris. The talent disparity is real, but the nets have such a upper hand in coaching and overall BBIQ that it's not even funny.  I almost passed out when Giannis took that fadeaway over Harden, I basically lost all hope in them that very moment."
Seems like NBA Finals MVP will be between Joe Ingles or Tobias Harris.
I mean same could be said for Joe Harris in Games 3 and 5
"It might not be Jeff Green next game but it could easily be someone like Joe Harris going off for 3, he's well past due"
Nets winning with 12 points Joe Harris has the best scorer
They are going to trade him to the Pacers for Myles Turner.        Pg - Irving       Sg -Harden        Sf - Joe Harris         Pf - Durant         C - Myles Turner
Eh. If Joe Harris stopped eating butts at a semi-professional level KD could maybe get away with a 9/10 performance
"Much like Redick and Korver who often lay an egg in Playoffs in the past. Current Guys like Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson typically struggle astronomically.. Duncan had 1 good game vs the Bucks when we got swept but overall from the bubble debut to this post season he been bad..  There’s levels to this. Remind me to appreciate Klay more, who even could have streaky and off nights but more often than not he will pull thru for you when it matters"
Sadly Joe Harris so far :^/
&gt; Joe Harris needs to step up  Ill take things that won't happen for 100
"Play him, less minutes tho. Joe Harris needs to step up run more plays to get him going."
"Re-read what I wrote. You can force players off their spots with long defenders, double teams.  We both watched crunch time last night. Giannis standing in the corner on Joe fucking harris, and no double sent to KD"
At this rate Finals MVP is gonna be somebody like Ingles/Bridges/Joe Harris/Shake Milton because those will be the most talented players left.
All the bucks had to do was play team basketball instead of reverting to bad decision ISO ball. It honestly just felt like they had too much nerves. Them and Joe Harris.
Smokin Joe Harris
"The Buck needed Harden and Joe Harris to look like a corpses, so they could barely lose at home. I can twist narratives too."
"You can't let KD beat you plain and simple. just throw doubles at him. He's prone to errors when passing. Game 5 was a horrible Harden night coming back from an unrecovered injury. Why tf was he getting doubled? unfortunately with the Bucks luck, Joe Harris could have a breakout game and go for 8/8 on 3's like Uncle Jeff did."
"&gt;If the Bucks offense doesn't stall the way they did in the second half, or if Green doesn't have a career night, or KD doesn't have a historical performance, nobody would question this.  If the Nets offense didn't stall in the first half, if Joe Harris didn't go 1-7 on threes, if Harden didn't go 0-8 from three. That can go both ways"
I feel like no one on the bucks knows how to do a simple entry pass to the big man in the post while Joe Harris is on him
At this point you just let Joe Harris free. That's what Miami did. It would've worked if KCP decided to not be a bitch and hit every shot.
"Last night he said Joe Harris got a rebound and was running the ball up court, but he was on the bench :("
"This was by far Bud's most inexcusable performance he's had. After all season of experimenting with adjustments and not riding and dying with the scheme I though there was maybe a chance in the playoffs he'd adjust.   But nope.   1) Harden played more than Giannis which is UNBELIEVABLE.   2) The team was making off-ball movement in the first half which made it exceptionally easy for the ball-handler to drive and dish. We completely went away from that in the second half. There was several possessions with Jrue, Giannis, and Middleton where they get the ball at the top of the key, NOBODY moved, and they waited until 5 seconds left on the shot clock to promptly throw up a contested shot.  3) Bud left Brook in the game while he was the reason for 5-6 open threes in a row while he hid in the paint. Bud went big, okay great, so we were at least abusing the only benefit of this and posting him up right? Wrong, Brook didn't get to post up his 6'8 center defender Jeff Green a single time.  4) Bud played ELIJAH FUCKING BRYANT in this game, who has played one NBA game before this playoffs, instead of Bobby Portis or even just Pat in the first half, this allowed the Nets to go on a solid little run when we were streaking in the first half.  5) And to top it all off, KD is going absolutely nuclear, best game of his career. Absolutely HUNTING Brook(who should've left the floor after the first 4 KD mid-ranges) and Pat(who tried his best but was too small) and Bud hides Giannis in the corner on Joe Harris. Doesn't double KD off of Harden who literally looked drunk out there.   I get a lot of people are saying ""Giannis can't fight around screens, KD would probably cook him"". Great, can we at LEAST FUCKING TRY IT. He's obviously cooking everybody else, and you have a DPOY AT LEAST SEE IF IT WORKS. We saw this exact case with Jimmy last year, Giannis never guarded him, he torches. Giannis demands to guard him a year later, absolutely locks him down. I'm not saying he would lock KD down, but that pattern has to make you think ""hey maybe this could work I'll give it a shot"".  For me this is peak Bucks disappointment. I barely came in with high expectations this year, with this current team I will never again expect us to win anything."
"I think that's likely, but I also think it's likely that Joe Harris doesn't shoot like Icy Danny Green. I think that's most likely to even out to about the same production between the two players.  If the Bucks don't hunt Harden off the floor, then I think it's a game, but the Bucks should be going after him, and hitting KD with as many screens as is humanly possible, in order to wear them down."
Joe Harris has played like that literally all series
Nah him kicking it to giannis in the corner to brick a three over joe harris would be more fitting lol
Joe Harris been shooting like dookie all series
I doubt they’re depending on Green to have games like that. Joe Harris and Harden not being able to hit anything won’t happen again most likely
"Look at the process for the bucks:  They didn’t know how to target harden defensively the entire game, in crunch time they give it to Giannis and he either does something stupid or gets fouled and misses free throws.   Your mistake is that your entire analysis is based on pretending the bucks are going to be in the exact same game in game 6.  They might not be up 22-9 in game 6. Sure, someone like Jeff green was hot but Joe Harris hasn’t made a shit for three games now. If he gets going, if harden is more useful, there are numerous scenarios where the nets can play a better game outside KD going forward. And all they need to do is win 1 of the next 2. What if the bucks have one of their games where they can’t hit a 3? It’s just ridiculous to ever treat a 3-2 deficit as not a big deal, specifically when the team down 3-2 massively blew game 5"
Do you expect Harden to play like a G-leaguer for the next 2 games? Or Joe Harris to be the worst shooter in the league?
I want his DPOY awards retroactively taken away. They got KD sizing up Middleton and Tucker in the clutch while Giannis hides on Joe Harris in the corner.  Ridiculous
"Joe ""I live with my mom, walk to work (Barclays) and take the subway home from practice"" Harris  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [Link about his mother and she moving in.](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/7/2/21312086/jarrett-allen-joe-harris-talk-hoops-but-also-living-in-brooklyn-during-strange-times)  [Link about how he gets to Barclays and the Nets practice facility.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/sports/basketball/joe-harris-nets-brooklyn.html)"
"Yep, I saw Joe Harris guarding Giannis multiple times down the stretch. Giannis then proceeded to clear out and let Jrue isolate every single time. SMH"
"Man, same old Bucks. Little to no adjustments. One of the best scorers of all time and you give him the same looks the whole game? Giannis guarding Joe Harris down the stretch was such a waste. They didn't need Giannis AND Lopez rim protecting against the team that a) doesn't have much size, and b) wasn't even attacking the basket. The thing about the playoffs is you have to make adjustments in game cuz if you wait it'll cost you a game."
"Joe ""I drive a dodge stratus"" Harris"
And I can promise you joe harris won't be shooting 18.2% so it all evens out.
This may be the most ass playoffs of all time   Finals is gonna be best of 7 games of Joe Harris vs. Jae Crowder one on one
Yea KD wasn’t as big of a threat so they could afford to chill and single cover him  Joe Harris must be shut down at all costs
Joe “Davis Bertans” Harris
Joe Harris getting his own hate post after a few bad games is pinnacle r/nba.  Why are you the way you are op? Can’t imagine
"Nets went 49.4% FG and 37.2% from 3 as a team. Stop cherrypicking man, Joe Harris and Harden went as cold they can, while KD and Green hot fire. If anything, the Nets performance is actually not as historic as you said."
Bucks have a 16 point lead at halftime. James Harden and Joe Harris combine to shoot 3-21. Bucks lose by 6. Wow.
"If Joe Harris is any sort of star, than I have an amazing beach front property in Kansas to sell them"
Obviously KD's performance is the highlight of this game but huge shouts out to Jeff green dude was swished every shot in the first half it felt like. Also holy shit Joe Harris was bad
At the same time Joe Harris and The Beard had the worst shooting games of their careers. It balances out.
"This is KD's ""2012 Game 6""  But no you don't deserve an apology, because as amazing as he was he doesn't have that stat line nor win the game without James Harden and a crazy outlier game from Jeff Green.   You mentioned Joe Harris going off. That didn't happen.  Enjoy your downvotes. If you repost this I'll downvote you again"
Remember when people were saying Joe Harris is a better shooter than Steph Curry? Good times.
"That’s because he joined Steph and Klay and got success with those guys. What he did tonight he did with Joe Harris, hobbled James Harden, and old Blake Griffin"
"Yeah you make some good points and I appreciate the analysis. But you can always find similar things to say about the Nets side of the ball too. If Joe Harris, a guy who shoots 48% from 3, didn’t go 2-11 and 1-7 from 3 with 5 points in 37 minutes maybe the Nets win by double digits. I mean Harden (obviously hobbled but still) also scored 5 points on 1-10 from the floor and 0-8 from 3.  Either of those guys play better and that can offset some of the things you’ve mentioned as well."
Those last 2 games involved PJ Tucker being much more effective bothering KD’s space and giving him much tougher looks. This game KD had the upper hand on PJ and I just can’t believe someone is willing to go out on the best offensive player on the court getting the looks he wants. I’d much rather Joe Harris (who was fucking dreadful today) have to be the one to beat me than KD.
"Come on guys. Nets didn't win 4 yet. If harden is still a shell of himself, you expect Durant to have another 50 pt game? And Jeff green to have 25+? Joe harris should play better though.   Bucks in 7, gotta believe it."
Hey at least it was better than him having Giannis stuck in the corner blanketing an ice cold Joe Harris while KD was ablaze
"There was a possession in the 4th where he ran pick and roll with Giannis, they got Giannis's defender to switch, and an easy pass over the top would have been past a sealed off Joe Harris. But no, Jrue decides he needs to dribble ten more seconds and iso fadeaway against KD. Just ugly."
I swear to god if I have to watch another game of Giannis standing in the corner guarding fucking Joe Harris while Khris Middleton and Jrue get shot over by the best scorer in modern nba history I will simply not do anything but I will be frustrated.
"At least Simmons would have taken the challenge and attempted to guard KD, Giannis meanwhile was guarding the great Joe Harris."
"I’m in awe at the Bucks for all the wrong reasons.  I watched the first half on and off because I missed the early blitz by the Bucks.  In the aftermath it looked like the Nets were dead in the water.  Bad defense, bad offense, lack of energy.  A bad run from giving up I thought.  Then I tuned back in partway through the third and it was kind of the same.  Nets would threaten to get close then take a dumb shot.  Just from Blake he was taking every bad three imaginable.  1:1 fast break spot up 3, turn around 3 (seriously wtf), contested 3 from the top of the key.  Or they’d have another defensive breakdown.  Which was predictable, Joe Harris has sucked all week and Harden’s on one leg.  But then it dawned on me.  The Nets are playing like this and the Bucks have basically been living off the first quarter lead.  So how bad are the Bucks playing lol.  The played scared and stupid and lost for it.  Also KD was amazing.  That moment in the third when he realized Lopez may as well not have existed was great.  He could just drive past him, pull up in his face.  Whatever he wanted.  But as great as KD was playing, it just made me annoyed thinking about how stupid the Bucks scheme was.  Like I said, I’m just in awe of how the Bucks played that.  There’s so much more bad I could write, but they’ve wasted enough of my night as is."
"Joe Harris has been major cheeks. It’s been one game of Jeff Green, one game of Bruce Brown and one game of Blake Griffin"
"I mean the whole game, yeah. I get the logic.  But not when KD is on a tear and is hot like he was in the 4th quarter. In the 4th quarter, Giannis should be guarding opposition best player.   The likes or Jordan, LeBron or Kobe etc didn't exactly guard opposition best player always throughout the game. But late in the game in crucial possessions in the 4th quarter, they guarded the opposition best player. Giannis should be tasked to do the same. Have PJ Tucker on KD for the first three quarters. Then have Giannis.  It was embarrassing to watch Giannis on Landry Shamet and Joe Harris when KD was cooking Tucker and Middleton. Not even a Bucks fan and watching that made me so mad."
"Look some people are saying giannis couldn’t have guarded KD and that he’s better as a help defender.  Fair point! But,  1. He was on joe harris, bruce brown a lot or the time, is he gonna sag to help? No.   2. When he did sag off griffin, griff hit his shots.  3. Brook lopez on drop coverage was not the better option.  4. Its not like teams havent bothered KD before. They did it by guarding him with different players, doubling him, none of which happened today.  5. Sure you can’t expect Giannis to guard him all game but a couple of possessions here and there would have been good to try in the middle of all the eviscerating Durant was doing."
"Come on now. Did you watch the game? They absolutely shit the bed in this game and frankly they're lucky to have won two games in this series.   Games 1 &amp; 2 Nets were in complete control, game 2 especially an all time playoff embarrassment.  Game 3 was one of the least convincing playoff wins in recent memory. Credit to their defense that game but Nets missed plenty of open looks and only lost by three points (looking at you Joe Harris).  Game 4 Nets completely lose their composure following Kyrie's injury, Bucks get solid win without Harden and Kyrie.  And now they blow a 17 point lead tonight against a Nets without Kyrie and Harden playing on one leg.   This isn't even me defending the Nets as much as it is asking why are we trying to defend Milwaukee's performance this series? So many poor decisions throughout these five games."
"I think the Bucks are built to go further in the playoffs than they’ve shown. What I saw in the second half of this game was awful head coaching. A smart coach would have called time out after the third crap iso play and absolutely balled the players out. He would have also put Giannis somewhere important defensively instead of on Joe Harris, and demanded that he show everyone on a national stage that he’s a defensive monster and a superstar.   As it stands right now, they’re top talent 2nd round cannon fodder"
"Not just that but knowing Harden was pushing himself to play on the same injury he missed so much time for when he was listed out just yesterday def helped motivate KD. He said something similar post game  If he saw Joe Harris and Bruce Brown brick shots the way they did and he's the only guy really out there, I think he woulda given up"
Khash is being guarded by KD straight up. Meanwhile Brook has Joe harris and other mini men on him and has to stand outside to watch Alphabet Poup struggle in the post.
It’s because Jeff Green does not have the reputation as an elite 3 pt shooter like Joe Harris does. When Harris goes 7-8 he’s doing what the nets paid him to do. If green goes 7-8 it’s amazing because he’s an old journeyman by this point in his career. Kinda like how iguodala used to step up in the warriors later title runs
"It was a tough call, one of the greatest scorers of all time flanked by minimum salary players, a man with one leg and a Joe Harris who missed everything tonight.. tough call indeed"
Joe Harris man he ghosted when the team needed him today.
I mean do you really want to let Joe Harris take 3's? We know with hindsight he was off tonight but still.
But I expect Joe Harris to make at least 30% of his...
Better question is do you expect a a better Joe Harris in game 6?
"Bud to Giannis: Look at that player who has Joe Harris printed on the back of the jersey and just imagine he’s KD. Yep, that’s the guy you are guarding in game 6."
"This is the best carry job I've ever seen, and I've watched all of Lebron runs.  Down 17, without Kyrie, one legged Harden, and Joe Harris MIA, playing all 48 minutes, 49/17/10 on 70/44/81 and ELITE defense... Against a 2 time MVP and DPOY, Jrue, Middleton and a deep roster...  Again, I've never seen a better carry job than this, by anyone"
"""You're gonna guard Joe Harris and maybe play 40+ minutes of random and you're gonna like it"""
Bud - you’re gonna guard Joe Harris and you’re going to fucking like it.
"no kyire, 3 points from harden, joe harris makes 1 shot and you blow a 17 point 3rd quarter lead."
"Man, I don't agree with the Giannis hate but did you really just say ""barely beat us"" like the Bucks are hot shit? You guys are playing against a quarter of a Harden, a Joe Harris that forgot how to shoot, and NO KYRIE."
Joe Harris always underperforms in the playoffs
Joe Harris? That guys a non-factor.
"Don’t agree with op saying he beat him “by himself” obviously that’s hyperbole/exaggeration, impossible to do. just pointing out the nets shot worse from 3 than the bucks did as a team, Joe Harris (regular seasons best 3pt shooter) went 1-7, Harden goes 0-8 for a combined 1-15 between those two. so Jeff shooting as well as he did tonight evens out the ice cold shooting nights"
Not sure what Giannis is seeing but Joe Harris looks like the best player in the world and honestly it's not even close.
He’d rather guard Joe Harris in the corner. Such a fraud
"But he basically did lmao. But in all seriousness at least he contributed with assists. Joe Harris was a complete negative asset, I mean dang I felt like suiting up at some point. Somebody needs to investigate what's up with the dude. It's like someone's held his family hostage and he's being forced to throw games."
I dont mind hiding him on Joe Harris but he has to step up when KDs going off atleast in the 4th. Hes the DPOY wtf
No one is really talking about Joe Harris. Holy shit man. All time ICE COLD mentally defeated. Could not buy a bucket
"KD is an elite scorer, he was able to put on a historic performance by himself. Having the defense have to account for another prolific scorer would change the landscape of the series completely (like the first two games but we can't take that into account because you said so). The bucks are a great defensive team, they have multiple players/defenders with size, strength and being able to throw one or even multiple guys for the entire 48 minutes (which was what KD was playing for several games) took its toll on the nets offense. I don't believe they would have been able to do that with both Kyrie and Durant.   &amp;#x200B;  I watch a lot of Nets games, and Kyrie is an underrated on-ball defender, Harden on 1 leg, is a worse defender than normal they were several phases of the nets team that were affected with Kyrie going out. There was one play where Harden got a turnover and had to pull the ball back and let his teammates set up the half court, he could not even run lol . Kyrie in transition is an excellent ball handler, finisher, he is really talented.   They almost won with just KD, I don't see how them having another top 15 player doesn't increase their chances of winning, hell if Joe harris shot better than Giannis from the 3 for the series (around 25% missing a ton of open looks) they would have probably advanced."
Laundry Shamet should get Joe Harris' minutes and i think he'd get even better  he's had sparks of great playing on the clippers too but just a bit more contribution on defense and he'd be a very solid piece on a championship contending team
"That's not true though. Next season, guys like Cam Payne, Reggie Jackson, etc. might come back to earth, and guys like Joe Harris and all of the Bucks shooters might remember how to shoot again.  Or Paul George makes his FTs... or reverts back to his playoff/pandemic P days and never plays good enough to get them into a situation where those FTs matter.   Or Chris Paul might have a healed shoulder, or left wrist, or right hand, or whatever is bugging him... or he's a year older and loses just enough of a step to lose effectiveness.  There are so many hypotheticals you can imagine, but none of them matter. Even less so if we start talking about next year as if it would be an indicator for how things could have gone this year (e.g., if the Lakers are able to shore up their terribly constructed roster, or the Nets are able to get more than a dozen games to work on their chemistry... then clearly one would expect next year's team to be better than this year's)"
"Lite means a worse player of a similar play-style. Just because they are good shooters, does not mean that Klay is “Steph lite”.   Is Joe Harris also a Steph Lite? Was Bobby Portis basically Steph Lite this year?"
The Nets are going to absolutely crush it until they disband. If Joe Harris remembers how to play basketball they win that series.
"You do realize that Kyrie did play in three games of that series right? He played pretty well especially in comparison to Joe Harris and Harden's corpse. Bucks defense couldn't even limit KD when he was the only offensive threat. You think that their defense is stopping all three lool.   Also, funny to see you bring up Kyrie with the Celtics but not with the Cavs when he was crucial in winning a title."
"The Bucks are not deeper than the Nets. Outside of the big 3 Nets have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Spencer Dinwiddie, Blake Griffin, Landry Shamet, Claxton, and Bruce Brown. Bucks have Brook, Divencenzo, Tucker, Portis, Forbes, Teague, and Connaughton. The Nets were 1 shot away from going up 3-0 without harden playing at all. Its not to discredit the Bucks, I had them as the 2nd best team going into the playoffs but don't discredit the Nets for not having a deep team like the Bucks."
"Im just saying they themselves admitted they were getting iso heavy, and that was mostly Booker in the third quarter. The suns seem to be their best when theyre moving the ball around like they did in the first 2 games. But since CP3 has been getting clamped by Jrue and/or injury has been bothering him, they suns have stagnated in offense. Them trying to play hero ball is not gonna win the game for them. For example, KD played hero ball this year in the playoffs but thats because we literally had no one else. We had a broken harden, Blake who was gassed trying to stay with Giannis and Joe Harris with the yips. The Suns have so much more. Crowder and Bridges arent missing, Ayton is down in the post seemingly ready. Ill take your word that he has more dimensions, but from what Ive seen this postseason, hes just a scorer. A good one, hell, great one, but thats all ive seen"
"Kyrie has never played a full season. When you give up a third of your payroll for a dude who's almost guaranteed to not be there, you get hoping Joe Harris hits shots."
"I was actually wrong, mb, it's that shoddy guy who posts essays every day asking for Joe Harris to be traded, not your fanbase as a whole. Sorry my mistake"
"2 of the 3 Nets played in all 7 games. It was 2-1 half way through game 4 with Bucks leading when Kyrie went down.  The Nets won the 2 seed when the 3 of them played together a total of 7 games. Without all 3 they were still a very good team with a pretty good cast with Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, etc."
"&gt;That’s not what I said, but I guess reading comprehension is difficult.  You're gonna put this on me that I can't make sense of your nonsensical idea? OK 🙄  How exactly are the Sixers getting far enough under the salary cap to have the roughly $20 million it would take to sign Lowry? Here's what's on their books for next season if they renounce everyone they can:  * Tobias Harris - $36 million  * Ben Simmons - $33 million  * Joel Embiid - $31.58 million  * Seth Curry - $8.2 million  * Matisse Thybulle - $2.84 million  * Tyrese Maxey - $2.6 million  * Shake Milton - $1.85 million  * Isaiah Joe - $1.52 million  * George Hill - $1.3 million  * Roster holds for 3 empty spots - $2.78 million  * 28th pick - 2.02 million  * **Total - $123.69**  The salary cap for next season is estimated to be $112 million. That means the Sixers would need to shed about $31 million in salary to open up $20 million to make Lowry an offer (assuming you can get him for that much). So what is it you're saying, just salary dump Simmons and Curry to the Spurs with no salary at all coming back? Doing so would open about $30 million in cap space. So then how do they get both Lowry and DeRozan?   It's not about reading comprehension, it's just that whatever this idea of yours is, it doesn't make any sense. Please be far more explicit in your explanation if this is making sense to you."
"unsung hero? He's literally doing what's expected of him, which is to knock down open 3's. Easier said than done as per Joe Harris, but that's Pat's role. Holiday has impressed me a lot though. I didn't think he had it in him to rise to the occasion. It's almost like he's shy at the beginning of the game, but gets hyped up in the later parts."
"Christ that was over a month ago, why do you guys endlessly bitch about Joe Harris"
Everything I wanted from Joe Harris..
He’s better than Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson
"Suns would probably cook the Nets though, with how hobbled Harden was and Joe Harris being basura."
"You can argue based on position.  Is Harden a PG, SG, or SF for the Nets?  Put Bruce B in then what's his position? Joe Harris acts the most like a traditional shooting guard coming off pin downs and flare screens."
"The Nets don’t operate effectively with all (3) playing together. If so they sweep an empty Celtics team. Bucks likely win regardless, keep in mind with all (3) there’s virtually never going to be key offensive contributions from the bench and role players given they’re so ball dominant and they don’t seek out setting up teammates as a priority. Hence Joe Harris, Mike James, Bruce Brown, Shamet, and further a Jeff Green 27 points (7/8 from 3) in game 5 wouldn’t happen with all (3). Brown and Griffin were the only two who could exist off of lose balls and put backs. That team wasn’t setup for all 3 but did best with 2 stars. Don’t discount Harden as a facilitator in game 5 either. But as he looked more for his offense it hurt the team when he didn’t make or get to the line.   And for once understand that a team assembled of (3) health question marks is gonna be risky. Kyrie injury history is very lengthy, Harden was so out of shape to begin the year and never recovered. And they had a plan for Durant but had to sacrifice at the end of the regular season just keep the #2 seed due to Kyrie (8) game sabbatical, was great to him finish how he did."
imagine if joe harris was even this good smh
The anti Joe Harris
Middleton thinks he’s Joe Harris
Jae Crowder is who Joe Harris should have been
"It was though? If your best player can't get his team to perform well offensively, than that falls on the best player. He had Khris and Jrue to not only get him baskets but get him baskets in the clutch. Jrue and Khris were way more impactful in the 4th quarter of that game than Giannis was. Harden was on one leg out there, Kyrie was not there, and Joe Harris could not hit open shots. It was not a comparable situation at all. The only reason that series doesnt end in 5-6 is because Kyrie got hurt.  They can both play make better than Giannis can and get their teammates better looks. Giannis hasn't really played any elite defensive teams(except for the Suns who dont match up like amazingly with the Bucks) for pretty much any of these playoffs. He's played exactly one top 10 player in the league with his help injured. Giannis can't make raise a team offense like either of KD or Harden. Raw scoring is much less important than raising a team's offense. Plus the Suns in all honestly, arent really an elite offensive team and that's partly why the Bucks can get so many transition opportunities because they can contain the Suns defensively somewhat.  He can be taken advantage of on the perimeter. Giannis is a good help defender but he can't defend elite offensive players like KD, Harden or whoever. Giannis is a great defender but so is Gobert and you can take advantage of him putting him in on on one situations. Harden was getting buckets on him with one hamstring."
"When people don’t understand that shooters have hot and cold streaks, they’ll have hot games and cold games, hot quarters and cold quarters.  When I see people complain that a guy like Joe Harris or Danny Green lost the game for their team on a cold shooting night it annoys me so much. You live and die by the jump shot, it is literally their job and their role is to take shots when they’re open."
"That’s actually in the regular season, his career playoff 3p% is 33%. Some of his highest volume years, he shot 30% or below from 3.   It’s the free throws... TS is still decent because he generated free throws. Then again the rockets lived and died by the 3.   I’m not saying Harden is a trash shooter though, but KD, Joe Harris, and Kyrie are objectively better shooters from an efficiency standpoint. All 3 of those players are high volume, high efficiency shooters. No one is doubling Harden when there are 3 other shooters with objectively higher probability of draining a 3.   Also, even when talking about the rockets, it’s a death sentence to double Harden on the perimeter lol. You’re basically asking to get a Harden to the charity line."
"KD lost to Giannis in his house. Simple.  He had Joe Harris, Blake Griffin and one of Kyrie/Harden in every game.  Giannis also had DiVincenzo out."
"70% James Harden? Why are you lying, Harden was nowhere near 70% lol, Joe Harris was literally terrible in the playoffs and had a 46TS% vs the Bucks, shooting 34% from three. Blake was good but still Giannis had Khris Middleton and All NBA defender Jrue Holiday, it was nowhere near 'just Giannis'"
Not even an issue. The real problem was Joe Harris was shooting worse than giannis from 3
"Did you not see the clutch buckets jrue and khash scored in the 4th and ot. We had harden and Joe ""best three point shooter"" Harris brick wide open shots. I can atleast spare harden because he played 50 minutes with a hamstring injury which is very hard to do."
"They do if literally everything broke their way. Look at phoenix- no kawhi, no AD, injured lebron, healthy until the finals.  Look at Mil- if Joe Harris hits a three they go home.  If everyone on Portland was healthy, they get a good draw, and some major injury luck, they could fall ass backwards into the finals or conference finals."
"You have to take the shot difficulty into account. Joe Harris is not out here dribbling the defender away and taking a stepback 3, and Harden is not some spot-up shooter taking wide open catch and shoots."
Not in order  1. Love 2. Bledsoe 3. Kemba 4. Gobert 5. John Wall 6. Horford 7. Buddy Hield 8. Harrison Barnes 9. Eric Gordon 10. Joe Harris 11. Steven Adams 12. Davis Bertans 13. Gary Harris 14. Rubio 15. Marcus Morris 16.Terrence Ross 17. Malik Beasley 18. KCP 19. Al-Farouq Aminu 20. DeAndre Jordan
Pg John wall or Kemba ( they just at that point in their career) So Cj or buddy hield or joe Harris  Sf jerami grant or Otto porter jr ( young) Pf aaron Gordon or Julius randle  C andre Drummond or Kantwr super obvious
"A team with KD, playoff Joe Harris, half leg Harden, Buyout Blake, and Bruce Brown should not be a coin flip game 7 series, it’s because your team played awfully and made poor adjustments"
Our seasons was saved by Joe Harris building a house
Bro our only saving grace in the nets series was sleeper agent Joe Harris and KD just having to get tired eventually and just keeping up with him.
"Injuries and the fact that their roster is going to be severely limited to MLE type guys with those three oft-injured stars taking up so much salary. When one of them goes down and you have to rely on guys like Mike James and Joe Harris to step up, you're playing with fire.  I would honestly be surprised if Brooklyn is ever able to win a championship with this team. They are a team of shot-makers, sure, and if they are all healthy and on fire, then they can scorch anyone. But there's only one ball, and the rest of the roster isn't stacked with guys who are willing to get the dirty work done.  Hot take: If they actually see significant time together, one of Kyrie/Harden will feel marginalized, and one of them will not be on the team after next season."
"What are you talking about?  The pool play is basically a round robin tourney.  Their pool has France (a few NBA players headlined by Gobert but after that, not much), Czech Republic that got in by the skin of their teeth against Canada missing Shai and Murray, and Iran.  If they have that day, it has to be absolutely apocalyptic.  In reference to the FIBA WC team, you cannot seriously compare a Derrick White to Damian Lillard or a Joe Harris to Kevin Durant.  For the rest of the world, they're still massively behind.  Sure they lost to Nigeria and Australia but they're more than likely will adjust and be better."
Joe Harris?
"See this is what I hate about Lamelo fans. No he didn’t drag his team to the playoffs. I watched about half of all the hornets games this season and he’s not even the second best player on his team, he’s the third. Rozier and Hayward are both better than him. In fact when Lamelo got injured the team went on a 5-2 run before Hayward got injured and that was their best run of their season.  Lamelo this year without Hayward is 4-10. Hornets legit have a better record when he is not on the floor than when he plays. He didn’t drag nothing.   Now saying he’s better than SGA is a horrible take. SGA is legit one of the most efficient scores in the league along with Curry, kyrie, and lavine. He averaged 50.8% from the field, 41.8% from three, and 80.8% from the line. He missed 50/40/90 club bc of free throws but what he did is still crazy. And it’s not like he’s doing it on small volume either, he averages 23.7 ppg on that efficiency and it’s so much more impressive when you look at the situation he’s in. It’s much easier for someone like joe Harris or ingles to do it bc the defensive focus is not on them, it’s either on KD, Mitchell, etc. The fact that SGA is basically surrounded by scrubs (I love Dort but he still needs work on the offensive end) makes it so much more impressive bc he is the one who gets all of the defensive coverage. Lamelo is nice but he’s nowhere near as good of a scorer as SGA. He averages 15.7 ppg on 43.6% from the field, 35.2% from three, and 75.8% from the line all while being the third option for defensive coverage. SGA also beats him out in pretty much every advanced stat. If we’re talking about who is carrying their team it’s no contest. Thunder are 16-19 with SGA which is a borderline play in team (having a better record than both bulls and pelicans which would make them the 11th seed in both conferences) and nearly as good as the hornets record this year (45.7% to 45.8%). Thunder without SGA tho are 6-31, a 16.2% W%. That is by far the worst team record in the league and is the 12th worst record in NBA history. Hornets are 10-11 without lamelo (5-2 with just Lamelo out and not Hayward) a 47.6% W% and hornets are 23-28 with lamelo a 45.1% W%. Now you tell me who is really carrying their team: a guy who makes their team a borderline play in team when he plays while they’re a historically bad team when he doesn’t or the guy whose team has a worse record when he plays than when he doesn’t. It’s funny how you say Lamelo isn’t better than Fox but SGA is debatable when SGA is legit better than Fox"
"Jeff Green and Joe Harris, who says no?"
"The best players never go out for FIBA (no one in the USA really follows it) so it's actually rare we overcome the lack of team chemistry and win there.      If you go back and swap out Joe Harris for KD, Derrick White for Dame, a sophomore Donovan Mitchell for Devin Booker and Harrison Barnes for Draymond Green do you still think we lose in FIBA? I don't."
"PG - Harden SG - Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Durant C - DeAndre Jordan / Nicolas Claxton  They need a back up forward and back up guard and the 8 man rotation is set.  I can see two of the players below deciding to sign a cheap deal to get a ring with the Nets.  Guard - Victor Oladipo, Goran Dragic, Lou Williams, Derrick Rose, E’Twaun Moore  Forward - Danny Green, Andre Iguodala, Paul Millsap, Reggie Bullock, Markieff Morris"
"While I agree it can be crazy reactionary, I have to disagree in saying that the regular season matters more (It does if you’re not a true contender I will say).  It’s just a completely different game, and there’s enough sample size after two years or so to see how good a player is in a playoff setting. Guys like Harrell, Joe Harris, Zubac, Simmons play way more effectively in the regular season.   Schemes come into play in the playoffs, and if you can’t counteract it, your true value shows. We’ve been seeing this for a while with Simmons, and it’s not changing  Would you argue that Simmons not being a top 30 player is a “narrative” or is it the fact that he doesn’t look to score, he can’t space the floor, he can’t shoot free throws, and hasn’t been improving in 2 years where it matter most?"
"Outside of the big 3 + Joe Harris, what rotation players will they have next year?"
"Khris ""Not Joe Harris"" Middleton"
"&gt;That said, Joe Harris doesn't have anywhere near the volume that Klay has, and that matters.  Funny you mentioned this when you completely ignored the volume difference between Dame and Klay (and also shot difficulty and % of unassisted shots)"
They both have white dudes from Notre Dame   EDIT: Joe Harris wasnt on the 2016 Cavs. My bad.
How much did joe Harris regress? Ty Lue displayed preference for Terrence Mann which affected batums playing time IMO.  Also Morris got injured at some point in the playoffs too. Marcus Morris is what the lakers expected markeiif to be
...I guess Joe Harris is better than klay with that logic
No one but they all play with one or more players that require way more attention than they do... which is the only thing that matters.  You think Joe Harris doesn't have spacing playing with KD/Kyrie/Harden lmao
That's a nice thought but completely dismisses how good Klay is when he's hot.  What you said accurately describes every 3P shooter in the league from Reggie Bullock to Joe Harris.  The level Klay plays at in some games is unreachable by any of those guys.
Will Joe Harris be on the bench next season?
"2019 was a way worse roster than this one. The roster was Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason fucking Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba, and Derrick White. Their best player at the time was Kemba. This team’s best player is Kevin Durant."
Joe Harris maybe?
"Yup. They had Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, LeVert, Carroll, and Crabe. In the playoffs against us DLo shot 36% from the field and 32% from three. He's a good NBA level scorer, but not much else. That Nets team was good because of the collective, he just took the most shots"
Lakers:  Russell Westbrook/Klay Thompson/James Harden/Kawhi Leonard/DeMar DeRozan  Clippers:  Dejounte Murray/Kevin Porter Jr./Zach LaVine/Joe Harris/Jaden McDaniels
"Kyle Kuzma,Eric Bledsoe,CJ Elleby,Keljin Blevins,Jahlil Okafor,Mason Plumlee,Austin Rivers,Marvin Bagley,Jeff Green,Udonis Haslem,Kevin Love,Andre Drummond,Lebron James,Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan."
time to request one of those 2K sim dudes (mostly i just know clique and kenny) to do a 5 joe ingles vs 5 joe harris simulation
I simulate a Joe Ingles vs Joe Harris Finals every night in my dreams. It's the most glorious thing ever.
The Miles Turner-Joe Harris-Donovan Mitchell squad that got buttfucked by France would like a word.
How come Joe Harris isn't Top 50 then. He shot 50% from 3P%?  It is not about how u score. Just score the damn ball.
Harrison Barnes and Joe Harris started.. wtf?
Magic is a better ft shooter than joe Harris you ain’t gonna tell me he would be a better shooter than him in today’s game that’s nonsense
"When they got to booker &amp; Ayton rounding out the top 20 of said ""players you take right now to win a chip"", and now bridges being top 40 while simultaneously saying ""i dont think this is recency bias/overreaching!"" I couldn't believe it. Although, one of the recent pods had them drafting best duos from teams, and that bit was the most fun Ive had listening to a B-ball podcast in a while, especially when they did the Nets double pick twist. what an insult while also being a fair choice. (I think it was Kyrie+Joe Harris that was taken as a better pair before 10+ other teams had a first pair drafted with spurs being dead last IIRC)"
....that doesn't account for shot profile and difficulty. A three from curry vs joe Harris is not the same.
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"What in the fuck are you spouting? James Harden was injured, the man could not even drive and played terribly. NBA 3p% leader Joe Harris? Who played terribly in the playoffs and the Bucks series? Did you watch the game, did you actually see Joe Harris play? Kyrie for 3 and a half games you mean. You say it like Blake griffin right now in his career isn't merely a role player lol"
"I mean he injured his hamstring so he obviously couldn't jump as much so I can see his shot is affected. So is he that unaware that he keeps chucking and missing when he knows he's in terrible form. Instead of passing to better shooters like KD(who was going off) and Joe Harris(who sucked but still managed to shoot better than Harden), he continued to shoot and miss. It was either simply his shot choking or a failure in decision making, bad shooting like that is inexcusable. Look at Giannis, he got injured and has a much more athletic playstyle and yet he's back and looking like the best player in the league."
"Giannis with Kyrie for 4 games and Harden for 3 games, with the NBA's 3P% leader (Joe Harris), plus Blake Griffin will f**k the league.  With Giannis, even DeAndre Jordan becomes playable, cos DJ just have to guard the paint, while Giannis scours the help defense."
"Clear answer if teams were healthy is the Clippers.  Lead the league in FT% last year, and even more importantly, have the right amount of really good FT shooters at the top.  Kawhi and PG a pair of near-90% stars, Kennard career 86%, Batum career 84%, and Reggie Jackson career 86%.  Problem with Nets or Warriors is it gets a little shaky in the 4/5 spots.  Like as amazing of a shooter as Joe Harris is, he doesn't get to the line much and thus misses a lot more FT's than he really should."
"They definitely won’t make it within the next season or two, but they can (obviously) make some decisions to help themselves in the long term.   - Fire Luke Walton and look into a young assistant that will let Fox and Hali play faster   - Keep that backcourt together by any means possible  - Get an athletic rim-running center (In the Capela mold) if Holmes doesn’t come back  - Look into trading Barnes, Hield, and Bagley. Barnes, although a very solid player, doesn’t really fit the timeline. Hield is already 28 and might stunt Halliburton’s growth. And Bagley is toxic and should be traded just for the locker-room’s sake.   - Take Corey Kispert at 9. Might be looked at as a reach, but he’s a Joe Harris type of player that will provide elite spacing for those guards to operate.   - Take fliers on young players similar to Detroit with Josh Jackson and DSJ last year. There’s nothing to lose, and they might find a diamond in the rough."
I ain't complaining about the call - his face has just been a magnet. They wanted to give him stitches in the Brooklyn series after he caught a Joe Harris elbow fighting for a rebound.
Joe Harris is at least good at the one thing though
"Rap game Joe Harris, one dimensional"
"We need top 4 all time shooter Joe Harris out there.  Not enough 3s, that's why we lost"
"Despite his performance, his value is probably more than a Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris, Bertans type player."
I have noticed you saying the same thing three times now lol. Steph efficiency remains same without dray. Quit being so biased.  And Steph also plays on-ball. He is not Joe Harris or Klay thompson who can't create his shots off the dribble.
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Probably worse? Bruh it’s obviously worse. That team had joe Harris, Derrick white, Marcus smart, Harrison barnes, mason plumlee, kemba, Myles turner, and brook lopez. The only players on that team that are on the level of any player on this team were Mitchell, tatum, brown, and Middleton"
"with an ass squad lmao they didn’t have durant, lillard, booker, bam, but they did have joe harris. usa will be fine"
"Lol, a chair could lock up TLC.  KD giving his teammates too much love.  You need hard truth moments or else your supposed greatest shooter in the league (Hardens words) plays like trash for 5 straight games vs the Bucks (Joe Harris)"
"Why? Why would the Suns want to trade away cp3 the fucking FINALS MVP.   1st Finals in the suns franchise and they trade him for spencer, Joe(can't shoot in the playoffs) harris, Bruce(takes big shots in the playoffs and misses them when you have kd and kyrie) brown."
I know we not blaming white for that group being ass when we had the whole Celtics starting 5 playing worse than Joe Harris and Myles Turner getting dad dicked by Gobert lol
"Sure, shit on the 23-year old in his first playoff series ever getting shut down the giant Philly team that took the championship Raptors to 7 games.     So idiotic. Give D'Lo some help besides a Joe Harris that went MIA and a LeVert that only just beginning to shake off the rust"
"Yep agreed with everything you said. These are 2 good and talented teams but if either of them had slightly less luck they wouldn't be here right now. This Suns run is the luckiest of all time, people thought the 2015 Warriors were lucky but this is a completely different level of stupid good luck. And the Bucks literally didn't face the healthy Nets for a single game and still were an inch away from losing. I'm not gonna kiss their ass or be impressed that they beat KD, 1 legged Harden and a version of Joe Harris that was point shaving.  If the Suns and Bucks beat their opponents while they were healthy I'd view this series as a titanic matchup between 2 truly great teams and be invested in who won. But I just can't care when they've each taken the path they have. Going into these playoffs I thought I would be happy seeing some new faces in the finals but I was wrong lol, give me some combo of LeBron/Kawhi/Curry/KD in the finals again next year please lol"
They won game 3 by 3 points hahahah cuz joe Harris went 1/11 from 3
"They should get a knockdown 3 point shooter like Joe Harris, but then you have to worry about playoff regression."
"ngl bucks are hard to watch offensively. if nets had a decent role player after joe harris, it would be nets in the finals now. dinwiddle is all they would've needed."
"and both still shot better than Joe Harris, why???"
Lmfao what???? A sweep of the nets? The nets won game 2 by almost 50. I could say if joe Harris hits 3 specific 3 pointers the nets win in 5 lol
lol Joe Harris you little scamp
"Who did you want taking the shots? Joe Harris LOL. Harden was the only one who could create anything even with one hamstring. Once you are one leg, it considerably becomes harder to do anything, there was no one else who could create for themselves besides KD."
Ehh i think it was overstated. I’ll admit no depth was an exaggeration but it was basically Blake Griffin and Joe Harris after that.
"If Nets had Steph Curry instead of Joe Harris, they win. GUARANTEED!"
"Joe Harris really saved this mans job,huh?"
That's true. Flashes of Joe Harris.
joe harris on the bench
Connaughton nominated for the Joe Harris award.
I literally said the warriors are better ? What do you think I’m arguing lmao. I’m just saying the nets can have a better offense than the warriors because their role players are more offensively slanted. The warriors didn’t have anyone like joe Harris patty mills and Blake. They had iggy and dray who were the backbone of their defense
Probably because a home in Brooklyn costs the same as Joe Harris’ yearly salary.
"Yes  &gt; only has a career 36% 3 point shooting percentage.  he's not being fed open corner threes, he's making his own shot. if he was reduced to a Joe Harris/Korver role he would def be a 40+% shooter"
"Eh I wouldn't really say they choked, they just got hurt  The only guy who actually ""choked"" is Joe Harris and with a healthy Nets team you don't need him to play well"
"I’m a Celtics fan, I got to see 5 games of complete isolation basketball in the first round of the playoffs. They went so heavy on it that they froze out their best 3-pt shooter in Joe Harris."
"Wouldn't meet the qualifying games played to be recognized.    Otherwise, Joe Harris ain't shit compared to Drew Eubanks and Chris Silva, they shot the 3Ball twice as good as Harris."
"Duncan robinson,seth curry, joe harris, etc are better shooter than bird. Cmon its not so hard to see that. Bird was great on his era but he is nothing compared to current great shooters."
"In a universe where Joe Harris doesn't disappear in the playoffs I'd put the Nets over the GSW. A lights out shooter as your 4th option after Kyrie, KD, and James Harden? It's hilarious."
"Harden shoots 1% better than Luka's last season from 3 and no one is clamouring to call him a top 5 shooter in the league. He's just a good shooter and is extremely good at creating his own shot/separation so he can increase the volume without a dropoff in efficiency. Harden's 3pt% has barely changed season to season whether in OKC or Houston or Brooklyn whether he shoots 3 a game or 13. He's not a better shooter than Steph, KD, Dame, Kyrie, Middleton, Paul George for sure and there are others I would pick to be better that are just coming into their roles such as Zach Lavine who I think will have many seasons of shooting 40+ from 3 on high volume that aren't pure catch and shoot guys like Klay, MPJ or Joe Harris.   If Harden suddenly shot 40%+ from 3 in Brooklyn or had shot that in OKC on lower volume catch and shoot type shots you would have a point but he never has and most likely never will. He's an amazing player and excellent at creating his own shot from behind the line consistently, but he's a not a top shooter in the league. He's a way better passer/playmaker than he is a shooter and that's where a lot of his value on the court comes from."
"There’s nothing about Wall’s play this season that suggests he’s taken a big step back from where he was. And subsequently get to the point of being out of the league like Cousins.   Many thought Rose was heading in that direction. Look where he ended up. Slight bit of skill and a team that understands you and he’s a fairly large contributor to a higher seed.   If Klay can’t run like he used to off screens , he becomes a more stand still shooter than a movement shooter. With his shooting, that turns him into a better version of Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris. While still being a physically bigger player on defense. If he can’t chase guards, he’s strong enough for 3s. In the finals Kevin Love couldn’t post him up. He got moved back.   He will change. He’s not Cousins."
"Bogdan Bogdanovic has a pretty handy 1-on-1 game. Bojan less so, but he's still not a unidimensional player on offense like Danny Green or Joe Harris."
"RJ is right. Klay has way more 1 on 1 game more than that of Joe Harris, Bogdanovic, Danny Green type for sure.. that’s why I always hate the comparison of Klay being a 3nD player..He was a legit all star with star attributes.  That being said tho, Warriors case for being the best brand comes from their star players identity that came with the pre existed foundation of ball movement, screen, cuts, motion offense smart making move off the ball… KD can fit in anywhere with any system. We also got to see the Warriors beautiful brand of basketball since 2014-15 and had 3 seasons with KD in that system.   We barely got to see a full strength Nets altogether. Nets do have some elements of an off ball plays, there are plenty of plays where Kyrie and KD screen for each other’s to either create mismatch on switch or to beeline for the lay up off miscommunication.. I think given time Nets will come to their identity of all around well offensive juggernaut that can kill anyone in Iso, PnR, ball movement… hell even Harden was cutting without the ball in the series against Boston.. there is also so much more shootings on this team than GSW. KD, Kyrie, Harden, Harris, Patty Mills… that’s just absurd spacing all around  even if Joe Harris can be a brick layers in Playoffs they can afford it"
"Not disagreeing, Dray is definitely the right choice. But Klay would basically be a better shooting/scoring Joe Harris with All-Defense capabilities. Either one would make the Nets unbeatable"
"Peak Dray would be wayyy better replacement for Griffin, than peak Klay would be for Joe Harris in that lineup."
Joe harris is a 3pt threat but without the D. He is not a 3&amp;d player
"Did u just say Joe Harris? The rest I agree, but Joe Harris like come on mate."
"Joe Harris, Nets probably win the East if that guy doesn't drop a Cleveland steamer on his team"
"Giannis obviously has elite lateral quickness compared to PFs he's up against. But the one thing KD has athletically is lateral quickness, and that's why he didn't spend much time guarding him. Giannis can be guarded 1on1, that doesn't mean shut down. Any star can be guarded, but I'm talking about slowing them down not stopping them, which doesn't happen.  And you're talking about Giannis elite help D (which is true) and then reference Joe Harris, a 3 point threat, and Jeff Green's big game which was basically all 3 point shots. Not sure how Giannis help D helps those"
"1.	Robert Covington, Klay Thompson, Joe Harris, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges are both better 3 point shooters and better defenders than Lonzo 2.	He has never impacted the defense like an elite option has before. Sure, hes a good defender, but Jrue Holiday is so many tiers above him and didn’t get a defensive award in 2020. Why would the Pels get such a terrible defensive rating on the perimeter if Lonzo was actually “elite”. 3.	He is not an elite playmaker in the half court. In fact, he his below average for a point guard. There’s a reason he was relegated to 3&amp;D over fucking Eric Bledsoe. He doesn’t have handles and cannot create his own shot. He was the secondary playmaker when Jrue started as SG. 4.	please tell me how he’ll be better than Zach Lavine, DeRozan, Lowry, Kyrie, Simmons, Beal, LaMelo, Trae, Harden, Butler, Garland, Sexton, etc to get an all star vote. Especially since he’s the 4th best player on his team"
"&gt; KD was the Nets only offensive threat.  Jeff Green had 27 in the one game y'all won without Kyrie lmao. Not to mention a guy like Joe Harris who was trash still has to be guarded cos he was the best 3 point shooter in the fucking league in the regular season  &gt; If that were true he would have been on him rather than worrying about help defense on their scrubs and role players.  Anyone can score in the paint and Giannis helps stop that, which is why he's the best help defender in the league.   &gt; He made that block because he's a freak athlete  Yeah a freak athlete with lateral quickness, hence him being a freak athlete. He literally wouldn't have been able to pull that off without lateral quickness he guarded Booker and then shuffled over to Ayton and got up to block him. But you said in another comment that Giannis can be guarded 1on1 so I was probably right in saying the Nets series was your first time watching him, you clearly weren't even watching basketball the last few years"
"lol Lebron is the longest tenured player on *either* of the LA teams, and longer than anyone on the Nets other than Joe Harris. What a time to be alive lmao"
"Joe Harris, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, and DeAndre hunter too"
i said main cores but you right i forgot about joe harris. but thats about it in their main cores.
"Claxton. Joe Harris is essentially homegrown. Cam Thomas will play. Sharpe, Kessler, and Duke all rookies developing behind them. Lakers don’t even have anyone homegrown except THT I think"
Most important for the entirely wrong reason: Joe Harris  He missed wide open shot after wide open shot. The Nets could be NBA champions if he doesn't choke like that.
Joe Harris?  Catch and shoot 3.
And how did Joe Harris perform 😤
Giannis was literally hiding on Joe Harris most of the series
Lmao joe Harris sucked and Blake Griffin is way past his days. Giannis had way more help and barely won. 2021 bucks aren’t even a top 3 team
"Lol you aren’t even a Nets fan and I see you defending the Nets more than actual Nets fans.   Every one including bucks fans know if they were healthy we would have lost. Superteams are meant to win, that’s why they are formed. But when you have a super team you lose out on depth and even for a team like the Nets they has decent depth. Joe Harris was good during the regular season, Blake Griffin was having a pretty good year, Bruce BRown had his games where he did good, Mike James even had good games. You can discredit our run as much as you want and bitch at people who talk good about Giannis but it ain’t gonna change the fact Giannis has a ring and Harden doesn’t (which I assume is why you are always so bitchy towards anyone saying good things about Giannis)"
"I don’t really think you’re giving him enough credit as a passer. He may not have games of 10+ assists but after closely watching him over the last season I can assure you he’s a deft playmaker when he needs to be. And that’s the thing - he doesn’t need to be that because that’s not the best way to utilize his skills. You said it yourself, he’s probably the best scorer ever. Why have the best scorer in the league look to create shots for others? Especially if a playmaker like Harden is out there with him. None of this to say Durant is actually capable of playmaking the way LeBron or even a Luka is - I don’t think thats the case. But the overarching point is that throughout his career that hasn’t been the way to use him anyway.  As for Joe Harris, there was nothing that could have saved him in that series unfortunately. He led the league in 3PFG%, his role is entirely to make his threes. There’s no reason in changing his role mid series in an effort to gain confidence by getting buckets under the rim. There’s plenty of other guys on the roster who are meant to get shots under the basket, he isn’t one of them. If you look back on his film from that series he is just straight up missing open looks, there’s no playmaking that would have helped him out more there."
"On one leg or not, he still clearly had star gravity. And idk what everyone is not understanding about this. KD scored a bunch of iso buckets trying to hero ball his team to wins (he was great defensively though). That almost never wins basketball games alone. KD has never been able to consistently raise the floor of his team through playmaking. Everyone is always like “Oh, Joe Harris wasn’t able to hit any threes” like ok?? Get him and everyone else better looks near the rim. Bron is able to do that, Steph, Jokic, Luka, etc. I’m not saying those guys are better but…KD gets buckets. That’s what he does, and he is no doubt in my mind the best scorer ever. That does not win games by itself though."
&gt;They would have won if Joe Harris wasn’t so bad in the playoffs.   And the Bucks wouldn't have looked like such an inferior team if Middleton and Holiday actually played even just somewhat decently in those first two games. It goes both ways.
"So, do you think Joe harris is a better shooter than Klay Thompson?"
"You can't say Joe Harris is the best spot-up shooter in the league when his most recent games in the playoffs were really poor performances, and Klay should be returning from injury this year."
"Yeah, I get no one likes us. Idc  But we took them to 7 with half our team hurt, joe harris shitting the bed, and bruce brown shooting the ball.  But injuries are a part of the game, it sucks we probably got bounced due to that but it's whatever"
"&gt; the raptors only won that title because KD and Klay were hurt lol.  and KD only won any titles because he joined the team that knocked him out of the playoffs after he choked a 3-1 lead over them  &gt; Also KD literally carried a bunch of scrubs and a half legged harden to almost taking out the eventual champions by hitting big shot after big shot  how did he ""carry"" when kyrie played for 3 of those games? interesting to hear that blake griffin and league-leader in 3pt shooting joe harris are scrubs now"
"Nets still run through the league with 2/3 healthy. Shit, would've won last year with Kd and an immobile Harden if Joe Harris hadn't been atrocious. Even if Harris was just ok or bad they would've been fine."
"They also have Patty Mills, Joe Harris (Nets win it all if he doesn’t underperform for no explicit reason), and some solid role players"
&gt;	They were better than the Bucks last playoffs even with just KD and Kyrie healthy.  They would have won if Joe Harris wasn’t so bad in the playoffs.            There is no answer for Durant in the East.
"If you struck the 2nd and 3rd players on every single team and then had them all compete, I don't think the Nets would rank particularly high because their roster past Joe Harris was old and/or devoid of defensive or playmaking talent.  ""But only the Nets lost their 2nd and 3rd best players it wasn't everyone"" yeah well that's just how injuries work in sports. It's next man up and the next men up for the Nets weren't good. Having better backup ball-handlers than Mike James, Tyler Johnson, and Chris Chiozza would have made a difference in the Bucks series but they instead opted for the ""put together a big 3"" route. It was a risk/reward proposition that they lost, and declaring that you're the rightful ""best team""  anyway is basically deciding the team should be absolved of that risk."
IIRC only Joe Harris and Stephen Curry shot a better percentage on catch and shoot 3s amongst 40 odd players that attempted at least 5 catch and shoot 3s per game last season.        His offball game is fantastic and a real asset.
"He had no Kyrie, a one-legged Harden, a choking Joe Harris and G-leaguers when Brooklyn nearly beat Milwaukee over the last 3 games of their series.  But when he has better players and fails, he's absolved of any blame?"
"Roleplayers are roleplayers because they perform a specific role to the team, not because they're devoid of blame lol. If your role is to make open threes and you're unable to do that when it matters then hell yes you deserve blame (looking at you Joe Harris). Have you ever seen the meme ""you had one job""? It's one job, but it's still a job nonetheless."
Joe Harris?
I've seen people get upvoted for saying his brother and Joe Harris are better shooters
Joe Harris?? Christ the dude is down bad after that Bucks series huh
"2021-22 Chinese Basketball Association Dream Team    PG Isiah Thomas    SG Dennis Schroder    SF Joe Harris    PF Ben Simmons    Center Rudy Gobert     Bench: Bradon Knight, John Wall, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle, Kristaps Porzingis"
"Now he teams up with Harden &amp; Kyrie while being flanked by Joe Harris, a squadron of former ALL NBA players and Patty Mills.  Brooklyn Nets really looking like the greatest offensive team of all time."
80% of Joe harris' 3PA are catch and shoot
"It's honestly amazing the Nets forced a game 7 OT against the eventual champs with Harden injured, Kyrie injured, and Joe Harris forgetting how to shoot."
Joe Harris’ three point percentage halved in the Bucks series. Incredible.
TBH if the nets would have won . Jrue and Middleton would have caught a lot of shit. Somehow an injured Harden had the same point and efficiency as Middleton . Jrue had a catastrophic game offensively that the net were leaving him open in the corner. The game hinged on Pg tucker being somehow more efficient than Joe harris which should never happen
"Do you think TJ McConell is physically gifted, or Joe Harris? How about Rajon Rondo? There's plenty guys out there that don't depend on genes to play in the league. The superstars and such, sure.  It's not just a physical gift, it is the work and effort and playing a role in a team."
"Morey and those Dwight Magic didn't win a ring though. I remember specifically a lot of commentary around that time that said outside shooting was too unreliable to be counted on for a chip and that more traditional offense would always win titles.   The theory that the 3 opened up greater efficiency was certainly around pre-Steph. You're absolutely right about that. But it was him and Klay that together that changed the discussion from the theoretical to the practical. Guys like Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris and Evan Fournier don't get the nearly $20 million/year they're earning without Curry and Klay winning that first ring with Green, Bogut, Harrison Barnes and Iggy."
Yep or you become a Joe Harris or DRob type and focus yourself on one particular high demand skill
"If Joe Harris is responsible for creating a shot, the defense has already won.   He also shoots far worse on pull-up threes, when compared to Robinson."
pre bucks series joe harris is definitely a better player. harris can actually create his own shot. But the bucks series he somehow forgot how to shoot the ball lmao.
"I get that he's an amazing shooter in part because it's unblockable due to his height, just like KD, and is certainly one of the best in the league, but generational? Why?   What defines a generation? Joe Harris was drafted in 2014, Luke Kennard shot a higher percentage on 3.8/game vs 4.6 for MPJ and was taken in 2017.   Trae shoots a poor percentage because of how deep he shoots. Only Curry and Dame can shoot at an elite percentage from that range. MPJ doesn't have to create his own 3 point attempts and would struggle to do so because he has a bad handle."
"Mpj rarely takes uncontested threes. He's top 10 in contested threes made with the second highest percentage. Curry tops every single chart. Trae isn't anywhere close. Trae was a horrible name to even mention tbh. He isn't anywhere near the top of any shooting list. Hes an above average shooter with elite range and insane confidence. He's not matching any of the top guys in effeciency. The only shooters that were definitively better than MPJ this past season were Curry, KD, Joe Harris, and maybee Duncan Robinson."
“Joe Harris bricks another open shot fuck” these past playoffs was said a lot  by me
"Tons of fans are far too overreactionary and short-sighted. This is a naive take.  Maybe it's different for small markets, where the doomer count is less and the gratefullness is higher. But from casual to hardcore, fairweather to diehard, you will see savagery from fans.  It's the longtime watchers of the *entire* NBA league and game itself that are able to show temperment when it comes to their fandom.   Which is fine, fandom is being fanatical. so all in all, if there was no camera infront of them, we would hear ""Duncan is straight trash, dog water"" if this was between boys.  I mean Joe Harris' name can't be uttered in Brooklyn right now. Love the guy, really do feel bad for him + dont want to trade him, but not even I want to hear his name right now."
"Joe Harris looks like his first name could be Harris, too. He fits."
Joe Harris is definitely Joe Harris tho
"Haha this is a silly thing to argue over, but it's definitely 44.1. But anyway, I think I stated my point pretty clearly. The three point shooting gap between them isn't large; and given the substantial difference in attempts it's hard to argue that Joe Harris is a significantly better shooter overall. All told I'd say they're roughly equal."
Joe didn’t really turn into a starter 4 years ago   Since then he’s shot 45%. That’s better than Duncan’s best year. Duncan shoots more and higher difficulty but Harris is clearly significantly better by %
"Those regular season games near the end of last season were amazing to watch, although I think one of Harden or Kyrie was missing.  Also I'm ready for Joe Harris to go 8/10 from 3 and piss off literally everyone."
Nets have one. Joe Harris.
"Bobby Portis, Joe Harris, Jordan Poole, Trevor Ariza. The NBA is really spoiling us with this star power /s"
"I joined this Fantasy Football league where you can play against Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Diamond DeShields, and Victoria Vivians. There are still spots but you have to sign up by the 24th. There is a live virtual draft with all the players on the 26th.  https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
Joe harris would shoot under 38 percent if he took the level of 3s Duncan takes
"It's not, at all. Post a poll here if you want. Joe Harris is a much better shooter, point blank."
"Joe Harris has shot 47.4% or better on 3s 2 out of the last 3 seasons and led the NBA both times. Robinson has shot 29, 45, and 41% (all rounding up) his 3 seasons.   Joe Harris is the best 3 point shooter the NBA has seen (not accounting for volume or ability to create, which is where a guy like Steph separates himself) since prime Korver.  Robinson is merely very good."
Joe Harris is a way better shooter
"IMO it's a solid contract for the Celtics.  Look how much Joe Harris, Davis Bertans and Duncan Robinson are making.  Of course Smart is not the shooter they are but he is much better on defense.  The Celtics locked their role player into a very good deal."
It’s not even a bad contract. He’s getting paid less per year then Joe Harris.
"Hes just gonna be another Joe Harris, he will be a defensive liability on return still a great shooter but thats about it"
"&gt;and coming of two major injuries.  Yes, we're both talking about right now. The difference is that I think Klay is currently better than -1.5DBPM Joe Harris and -0.9 Duncan Robinson."
"They get picked on defensively. Klay is better than they are by an entire tier  ""Now they're saying -1.5DBPM Joe Harris and -0.9 Duncan Robinson are better defenders than Klay"""
"Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris can move laterally, they also aren’t terrible defenders they are just slight below average."
Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris get exposed elsewhere constantly. They are very valuable. Neither comes close to Klay's defensive IQ and experience though.
Joe Harris Kyle kuz and Schroeder too  Playoff flop all stars
"but what about Joe Harris who they are paying almost 20 million, and Deandre Jordan who they are paying over 10 million"
"Guys like TLC, Brown, ect. Are just spark plugs that feed off the big 3. Even Joe Harris turned into Barnacle boy when he couldn't hide behind Kyrie."
Obviously they thought Kristaps was good 2nd star to pair Luka with so need to find a “non star” with similar assets that is better than him…   Pg Luka  Sg joe Harris  Sf OG Annunoby Pf John Collin c Robert Williams  6th man Bojan Bogdanović- Utah Jazz  Rest of lineup tbd
you forgot joe harris being allergic to making a shot the entire playoffs
"I mean Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Shamet are pretty much better shooters than anyone left on the Warriors in 2019 after Klay got injured. Blake was also very good once he moved to Brooklyn.  Pretty much everyone outside of Draymond/Iggy were like out of rotations the very next year. Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, Shaun Livingston, injured Boogie weren't rotation quality players. And the two guys who were in Dray/Iggy are poor shooters who defenders will happily not guard - even an injured Harden receives more defensive attention.  The 2019 Raptors were also a better team than the 2021 Bucks. Kawhi was at the height of his game and EVERY single player on the Raptors was a very good defender and a good shooter and most of them good playmakers too. FVV, Lowry, Siakam, Gasol all good passers for their position while being able to shoot and defend, and then Danny Green, Norman Powell, Ibaka all being more 3 and D (+ more for powell)."
"I have an aneurysm every time I see rings mentioned. Ariza missed threes against GSW. Joe Harris missed threes against Bucks. Ray Allen made three against Spurs.   Three examples of role player shooters that swung championships. And by ring logic, affected the legacy of Harden, Paul, Durant, Curry, Klay, Green, Kyrie, Giannis, LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Duncan and more.   Or you can actually analyse the game instead of the win column."
"Kukoc was the 3rd best player on a 3 time back to back to back championship team (between Rodman and him depending on your preference); he was not just a role player.  Kukoc was nice! He was a mismatch at his size because of his shooting ability.  He could take bigs off the bounce and was able to hit shots over smaller defenders because of his giant 6’11 frame.  Although he was huge, he played like a small forward.    In my opinion, if he were on a team where he was the central focus of the offense, he could have led an average to below average team to the playoffs as a 7th or 8th seed.  Which is comparable to someone like Bradley Beal or ja Morant.  His game was not like those two, they are better shot makers and are more dynamic.  Kukoc was a better passer, rebounder, and shooter. I use these two to illustrate what I think his impact on a team would be.  Those two players are not considered roll players and I don’t think kukoc would be considered one either if he were to be playing today.    His game was perfect for today’s nba. Who knows though? I hear you with your argument that he is not as good as jokic, you’re spot on.  But kukoc was much more than just a role player (much better than joe Harris or Bobby Portis)"
"no kd is 6'10 (6'9.75 without shoes, 6'10.5 with) 225 pounds. (his weight at the olympics) hes a small forward that plays powerforward so joe harris can start for the nets"
"Nonsense. Of course Joel was better this year, he was healthy. That’s like saying Joe Harris was better than Klay Thompson."
You forgot Joe Harris
one could argue that he would’ve been better in Joe Harris’ minutes. Harris was awful in the playoffs.
kyrie &lt; curry  harden &gt; klay  KD = KD  joe harris &gt; (current) iggy  (current) blake &lt; draymond
"Maybe they would have given some of those Joe Harris minutes to him, but he would have been picked apart of defense.  JJ took the most money available to play for the Pelicans.  Got zero sympathy for him."
"1st rounders:  Guards: Marcus Smart, Zach Lavine  Wings: Wiggins, Randle Center: Embiid  2nd rounders:  Guards: Dinwiddie, Clarkson Wings: Joe Harris, Jerami Grant Center: Jokic    I think the first rounders are a title favorite. Seconds rounders are probably a 3/4 seed in the west"
"Damn, how has there only been one Kyle Korver answer?  Dude was averaging 12 points a game. Sure he was shooting an insane 49% on threes (2.9 makes on 6 attempts average). But 12 damn points and he literally did nothing else on the court. Stats like that make the 3 point contest, not the all star game.   Korver making the all star game would be like if Joe Harris made the all star game this year."
"He wouldn’t need to, he’d probably just average 35 8 5 like he did against a better version of Giannis 5 weeks ago. Literally would have won if Joe Harris hit 1 wide open three or his shoe size was smaller. Did you not see that? Did that not happen? Am I living in an alternate universe where we all didn’t see what he was doing single handedly?"
"Jokic, Draymond, Jeremi Grant, Joe Harris, and Spencer Dinwiddie would be a pretty awesome second round draft pick only playoff team. THT, Mitchell Robinson, Brogdon, Bogdanovic, and Powell off the bench."

"Yeah but it’s always shitty. Role players aren’t meant to hit big shots. That’s why they get payed less. Joe Harris was never supposed to be our number 2 option. Would have loved for him to step up but if he had that ability he wouldn’t be a role player.   As far as this goes, that’s nice of Thybulle to say but he also wasn’t the second option who was getting intentionally fouled because he couldn’t hit a free throw. And also hadn’t secured 175 mill."
He shoulda fed….   *checks notes  Joe Harris and Jeff Green more.
Or Joe Harris
"&gt;The way they see it, he lead an attempt to save your democracy from the commies, blm thugs and soviet lgbt+ woke people.    Which is one of the dumbest fucking political views to hold. The people who believe Joe Biden and Kamala freaking Harris are communists have zero idea what the hell they are talking about, not to mention the perceived need to be ""saved"" from LGBT people."
"Because Joe isn’t scared of the moment, he just shot like hot garbage. People shit on Ben because he’s a 1st overall pick on a max contract, and he’s afraid to shoot the ball in a big moment. I’m not gonna be upset with a teammate that shoots a good shot and misses, but I absolutely will for a teammate that has a good shot and doesn’t take it.   In summary, Joe Harris would’ve dunked on Trae Young"
"He is kinda a victim - out of 15 non-champion teams no other player this year was singled out and slandered for a mediocre playoff performance by their own teammates and coach, that’s not at all normal behavior.   The Nets would have beaten the Bucks if Joe Harris didn’t shit the bed - do you see Nash or Durant out on national TV talking bad about him?"
Yeah and he had Jrue/Khris while the other had Joe Harris and Jeff Green.   Did him going off against the Suns change your ranking of him? Or was he always number 1 for you?
"&gt;If Chris and Jrue didn't shoot a combined 8% game 7 would have been a blowout  and if half of the Nets weren't injured, it would've gone 4 games max. the ""what if"" game isn't one y'all wanna play. joe harris also shot like shit but that's not a ""what if"", that's just him playing bad.   &amp;#x200B;  no shit it was only KD capable of doing something. they were missing $100m worth of players."
"What does Jrue have to do with this dude lmao  Like what, you brought Jrue Holiday in a Joe Harris shooting thread"
"Joe can do his thing in the regular season, but if I'm Nash.. I freeze him out during high stake moments in the playoffs. I'm sorry, I just don't trust Harris anymore like that."
"I kinda get it when it's Kawhi or someone, who's shat on people's teams for years. But wtf did Joe Harris do..."
"I can't describe the emotions seeing Joe Harris shoot open 3's in that series. ""NO! No wait maybe it's good! No wait it's still Joe Harris on an open three!"" and then I'd usually experience relief.  That said only *two* Bucks players shot better from 3 than Harris did that series. Jeff Green and Blake Griffin were basically stealing everyone's ability to hit 3's."
“Joe Harris who has not struggled for 3”  that was what started the curse…
"When Steph breaks this record, he will break it while....  a) Having the highest 3pt% out of anybody who is in the top 176 in most career 3ptrs in NBA History. 176th is Joe Harris and edges Curry out by like .5%   b) Being the primary ball handler and shot creator    c) Playing in roughly half the amount of games as Ray/Reggie.  \^\^ That is just a clean sweep of the entire 3pt category, and when you consider that Steph also has the highest career ft% over a certain amount of attempts, its a clean sweep of the shooting category in general.  Imo opinion, because of all of that, it will be even more impressive."
But Joe Harris is there?
"I don't have Luka higher than Harden, as a disclaimer. This is purely devils advocate stuff:  * Part of what made Harden so impressive in the past was having great efficiency while being the sole offensive engine of his team. Harden's usage went down a lot with the Nets, but his efficiency has stayed about the same - Luka might not be as efficient as Harden, but he's scoring more and now he has the mantle of having the highest usage rate in the league and being that sole offensive engine. You *could* argue that Harden's scoring is close and efficiency better but he's benefitted *most* of the season from having better spacing in the form of Joe Harris and usually one of Kyrie/KD next to him. Luka has a more difficult route to score so the efficiency difference is reasonable, but the 28/8/8.5 is an extra level. Basically, the idea is that Harden has gone from being an incredibly efficient first option single-man offense, to being an incredibly efficient first-or-second option with less shots.  * His play in the Bucks/Nets series has lowered opinion, partly because of the injured play and partly because it unfairly fed a narrative. First of, *obviously* he was injured and *obviously* couldn't perform to his usual standards. However a lot of his play when he came back injured had instances of poor decision making and/or adapting. A few times he would hold the ball until the shot clock had almost expired, then pass it off to KD who was well behind the line - it ate up time they needed, and forced KD into a bad shot. Despite not being able to shoot as well (not his fault, injured) he still had moments of playing like he could - Game 7 is a really painful example of it. Possession ended in his hands at least 25 times over the course of the game. He took *twelve* 3's despite not having the body to do it at the time.  * Luka's performance in the Clippers series. You can say Harden in the Celtics series but everyone knows there's a difference in the quality of opponents there, and the Celtics especially didn't have the players to field a defense even close to playoff standards. Since some opinion is that the Clippers would've been in the finals if not for losing Kawhi, Luka taking that team to 7 games looks absolutely heroic. Especially averaging 36/10/8 on 49/41 shooting. Yes the FT% was bad, but he wasn't getting very many of those anyway.  Basically, I think Harden has maybe dropped in some peoples views - and the team he is on and the role that he has is counting against him, with the opposite for Luka. *I* still think Harden is a better player, but I understand the argument."
"He passes to KD, Kyrie and Joe Harris. Luka passes to THJ, Kleber and DFS."
"&gt; Where did they say if the team has three superstar players or if a team has one or none? They never gave exact numbers lol.  They didn't, but I was trying to simplify it because it looked like you misunderstood.  &gt; Now if he’s a better 2nd option, wouldn’t that also make him a better 3rd, 4th, 5th etc option?  It makes them a better scoring 3rd, 4th, 5th option - but you're not looking at your 4th or 5th (or even really your 3rd that much) option to be a great scorer at all levels. Joe Harris scores for the Nets, but they have Harden/KD/Kyrie so they're not looking for him to make layups and run iso plays. If you have a spot for a player who will be getting say 8-10 shots a game, their ability to do things other than score becomes *more* important because their ability to score has become *less* important."
? Joe Harris was missing wide open
Oh for sure. I didn't mean it as a slight to Joe Harris. Just a big difference between $18M annually and $30M.
"""Joe Harris money"" is still quite a lot of money."
"I disagree. Nets did a great job of making quality signings and picking up players nobody cares about(Joe Harris/Dinwiddie) trading for DLO(who people were saying could potentially be a bust) and making good draft selections (levers, Allen), and because it made little sense to tank, we fought to be competitive and made the playoffs  If we didn’t make any of those moves, KD and Kyrie aren’t here. Big markets mean nothing in this situation. How many superstars did the Knicks get over the years sans Melo? And the Knicks are 10x more popular than us in this city and perhaps one of the 3 most popular NBA franchises ever"
"i mean he has a good reason to pick the Lakers over the Nets, the Nets may be the favorites however he’ll actually have a role on this team instead of playing second fiddle behind Joe Harris"
Like..joe Harris?
It was Joe Harris the whole time
"Lol, why would the Nets pick him up with Joe Harris on the roster?"
To be fair didn’t joe joe Harris poop his diaper during the playoffs? Though even playoff joe would be a better positive
you should've seen how many people wanted to dump Joe Harris for Reddick after the playoffs lol
"Well given how Joe Harris worked out, maybe they should've been looking for someone else."
Lol. Having your second and third best player injured and Joe Harris performing far below expectations is a lot worse than what the Bucks had to go through
It’s not that simple you clearly saw the injuries his team had and how much of a non factor joe Harris became.
It’s not that simple you clearly saw the injuries his team had and how much of a non factor joe Harris became.
"To be clear I'll rely on one of those metrics the day I doesnt see stuff like :  \- DRPM : Julius Randle, Joe Harris,Duncan Robinson and Jamal Murray in the top 15  \- DWS : Julius Randle, Jokic , Russ and Tobi Harris in the top 15  \- DBPM : Mason Plumlee, washed up Iggy, and TJ McConnell in the top 15 (Won't even mention who is 16th because it's hilarious)  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah for now I'll rely on my eye test, as flawed as it is, it's still better than total BS like that"
"Players being healthy and available and playing bad isn't really a ""break."" Joe Harris shooting like shit wasn't a break either, it was just bad play."
"He, kyrie, and harden don't need to play.    Patty mills, Tyler Johnson, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin is a good lineup."
Replace Harden with an average point guard that doesn't choke like Joe Harris and we win last year
"Calling him an average playmaker and average defender is a bit.  He is basically the same level of playmaker as a Kent Bazemore type, and statistically he is the worst defender on the Warriors.   Despite being on a good defensive team he has a -3.0 DRaptor (Lou Williams, DeMar DeRozan, DLo Russell territory), a -1.4 DBPM (same as CJ McCullom, Joe Harris).  He is a promising young player with potential to improve, but he isn’t average at playmaking or defence yet"
"You're going to need a team of elite defenders and consistent scorers who can drill 3s and penetrate to the rim. You'd almost certainly need to pick an elite playmaker and a top tier defender.   I'd choose KD, Curry, Klay, Draymond, with DeAndre Ayton at center  For the bench I'd go with Mike Conley, Buddy Hield, Covington,  OG Anoubly, Capela, Joe Ingles, Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Fred VanVleet, Tobias Harris  Maybe throw in PJ Tucker instead of a big for a death lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, PJ, Draymond and just destroy teams offensively and defensively with intensity."
I think your home field advantage was really strong mainly due to your guys being able to play really physical defense which wasn't flying in the nets stadium. Ofc on the flip side your perimeter defenders not being able to use the full scope of their ability at the Barclays center is a boom for our offense. But mainly I wasn't feeling super confident at y'all's stadium even with kyrie. I think you guys were the better team than KD only nets but by the margin of taking one away game by the skin of your teeth.  Also don't forget the only reason Jeff green had to make Steph curry look like Westbrook was because joe Harris was making Westbrook look like Steph curry out there lol.
"A big who can handle the ball like jokic and a 2 way guard like kawhi for all stars i would have two athletic guards like Jamal Murray and Mitchell. For the role players id have jae crowder, joe Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr, javale Mcgee, Duncan Robinson, and Caruso. The end of the bench could be Grayson Allen and Jah"
Same reason why Joe Harris is not considered better than Steph.
CP3/Curry/LeBron/RoCo/Embiid with a bench of Fox/Thybulle/Joe Harris/Thad/Valanciunas
Ss KD Giannis  AS Donovan Mitchell Devin Booker  The rest:  Christian Wood  Jalen Suggs  Joe Harris  Mikal Bridges  Joe Ingles  Seth Curry  Tyrese Haliburton   Jon Isaac
"Superstars: KD &amp; Curry All-stars: Dame &amp; Zion Role players: Tobias Harris, Jamaal Murray, Jonas Valanciunas, Myles Turner, Deandre Ayton, Joe ingles, P.J. Tucker, Ja morant (who I consider a star but technically isn’t an all star yet)"
"It's really not weird at all when he takes 11+ 3's a game lol   You just can't compare guys like Curry and Lillard to guys like Joe Harris, completely different shots and volume"
30 and 8 on 65% TS against you with a disabled teammate. It’s going to be hilarious seeing you try to defend him with kyrie kd and joe Harris waiting to shoot
"Watching the Nets totally wreck teams on offense is very fun, the big 3 are all so individually talented in their own unique ways to get their own buckets and when teams start to open compensate it can lead to some beautiful ball movement. Also I never get tired of watching Joe Harris splash open 3s or Blake receiving beautiful deliveries for Dunks."
"Without speaking on of KD/Klay mesh well  The entire point of this thread is players that are less than the sum of their parts. Even if KD and Klay are less than the sum of their parts, it's still better than KD and Joe Harris lol"
"Joe Harris was god damn awful, missing wide open corner shots everywhere. Of course the Nets would win if you sub his ass out for a much better player"
"Switch Joe Harris for Klay last year, do the Bucks still win? I think the Nets win and I don't agree with the idea that KD/Klay hurt each other or cannot mesh properly just because of lineup numbers that don't feature Steph lol. I get it. The idea is that they're ideally both not playmakers but KD has shown he's capable of taking on that burden so I simply cannot see why one of the best 3nD wings ever would be a bad fit."
"With regards to the Nets series, double Durant all the time, make hobbled Harden and old Blake/Jeff Green/ and Joe Harris beat you. On offense, attack Harden and Blake in PnR's, make extra passes because the old stiffs in Brooklyn can't keep up. Be physical with Durant when screening him off to tire him even more. Now obviously I can't MAKE the Bucks players listen to me as I don't have the experience, but I would have done these at least."
Joe Harris is GOAT change my mind
"Using Robinson as a baseline to show that Klay is streaky. Checked a handful of others (Steph, Joe Harris, MPJ) and Klay still had the highest standard deviation."
Do you think Joe Harris is an elite shooter?
"He’s an elite three point shooter and shot creator.  I can get more into the numbers if you want but it was getting long so just going to bring up a few points but there’s more data in support of this and many writers/analysts have echoed my claim.  Tatum is 19th in career 3 point % among active players. Of the 18 guys ahead of him, only Steph has been assisted on a lower % of his 3 point makes than Tatum has been: 61.7 vs 64.7 though Steph is also 3rd in career 3pt% which is insane. Meanwhile 12 of the other 17 were assisted in at least 90% of their made 3s. Expand the list to top 30, and the only other guy that qualifies is Kyrie who’s ranked 25th and has a crazy low % of assisted 3s.   Bball index’s perimeter shooting metric is very high on Tatum. It had him as the 8th best perimeter shooter in the nba this past season as well as the 2020 season. The players ahead of him for 2021 were Steph, Dame, Duncan Robinson, LaVine, Joe Harris, Hield, and Ingles. In 2020, it was Dame, Harden, Duncan Robinson, Bertans, Hield, JJ Redick, and Devonte Graham."
&gt; Patty and Joe Harris  The addition of these two is amusing.
[Charania] The Orlando Magic have traded Terrence Ross to the Brooklyn Nets for Joe Harris. Kyrie Irving is looking forward to having Ross on the team.
"Any team that has KD, Harden, Kyrie, Patty and Joe Harris is pretty stacked."
If he's joe Harris by the end of the season I'll be more than happy. I think the general public is brushing his injuries aside but fans at least here on Reddit seem to know better than to expect him to be his former all NBA self his first year back if ever
"Giannis, Jrue, Khris, Mccollum, Brook Lopez with Donte Divencenzo, Bobby Portis and Grayson Allen off the bench  Vs.  KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills with Blake Griffin, Bruce Brown and Lemarcus Aldrige off the bench.  Bucks match pure talent and probably win team fit here too. Second option is much worse from Harden to Jrue but Middleton is pretty close to Kyrie because of his defense and how valuable shooting is rn, while the Bucks have a better bench and Mccollum absolutely blows Joe Harris away as a player."
"It's not really about the FMVP, it's more so that Steph is held to significantly lower standards than players who he's supposedly better than.   If KD averaged just 26 ppg in this year's Finals and barely beat the Suns without Ayton and Booker and lost FMVP to Joe Harris, you think this sub would ""count"" his ring? Let alone call him the best in the league?"
"&gt;“That almost killed the team”   &gt;   &gt;Okay but it didn’t and he won a championship.   Brilliant analysis.  &gt;In a few years no one will give a shit about the injuries.  Naw, no one will forget the circumstances of this year when you bring up in arguments like this. We're all happy for Giannis &amp; the small market team winning and all in a vacuum, but when you use this ring to actively make arguments like these (or the posts comparing Giannis &amp; Shaq, Hakeem for example), the context will be brought up.  This isn't the 50s where people will forget what teams even played. In this modern era of basketball, and the world in general, everything is recorded.  &gt;When Donte went down, he adjusted.  Eh, not really, but then again he didn't have a ton of good options.   The problem with Bud was constantly playing Brook &amp; giving up countless wide open bucket to KD off of drop coverage. KD in that Game 5 scored damn near every point on a wide open shot. He also didn't pressure him or double him much at all, even when their 2nd best offensive options was either 1-legged Harden or cold Joe Harris.  There were more problems I've talked about before when the series was going on, but you get the picture.   &gt;When Giannis went down, he adjusted and won the ECF without Giannis.  I gave him credit for that when I mentioned he adjusted late in the ECF. Giannis going down allowed him to run more offensive sets with better flow, and allowed space for Lopez to eat down low.  &gt;Amazes me kids on here sitting on their ass with a phone in their hand call a player/coach in the NBA shit.  This is a common argument used in this context but it's such a pointless non sequitur that only a mouth breather would find profound. I can be an ass basketball player myself but still try to provide input with valid points to back it up; if I can't, what the fuck is the point of a subreddit called r/nba?"
"Embiid, Maxey, Thybulle, Milton, Simmons, Harris, Drummond, Isaiah Joe, bball Paul, Springer are all under 30  Curry and Green are the only players on the roster over 30 years old for reference"
Joe Harris
Joe Harris
6th man next to LMA and Joe Harris
"So Harden’s good regular season was more important to you than KD’s carry job in the playoffs? Yea sorry don’t buy that. Believe it or not the playoffs are more important than the regular season. Also the way your supporting cast was playing (mostly Joe Harris), it wouldn’t matter if Harden was finding them open looks they weren’t going in wide open."
"Ok at least you can admit it. So Joe Harris was bad in two of five games in the Boston series and then horrific in the last four games of the Bucks series. Also let's be clear that game three was his worst of the playoffs. So if the last four without Kyrie are horrific, I don't know what adjective you'd use for game three when he had Kyrie.  Jrue and Middleton would both be getting clowned right now if they had lost to the Nets and they both would deserve it. In fact they didn't lose to the Nets and people still clown them for the series. That's what happens when you only play well in less than half the games of a series. We always judge players by the few games of the playoffs, those games are the most important of the season."
"I think you're looking at it backwards.  More that the big 3 having the spacing to be dangerously elite like they are is predicated on the other two guys being shooting threats.  Harris is elite at that, and that's worth paying for.  Not his fault 2 of the big 3 were hurt, and the Nets bench was terrible.  The bucks could mostly double or triple team KD at will near the end of that series, but it wasn't by helping with the guy that was tasked with guarding Harris.  In that sense, Harris was still fulfilling his role.    Not particularly fair to say ""Oh, you can't hit at 40+% while being very tightly guarded, what a bum"".  If he could do that, he'd be getting Klay money, not Joe Harris money."
"This set is 100% a ""well what are you supposed to do"". You can't fight through the screens because if the defender on Durant sags to let his guys through, Durant just hits the shot. You can't switch easily because all of your momentum is carrying you the direction of the guy you're chasing and both Kyrie and Harden would eat you if you're already off balance. And if you pull in your defenders off the three point line that's an easy cut to the basket behind the defense or if you have Joe Harris that's enough daylight to nail a corner three. I don't think it'll work 100% of the times because the Durant passing window is hard to hit and defenders with length can prevent the pass, but damn if it isn't a wicked set."
Having Joe Harris in the corner with these 3 ain’t fair
"The league in general was more frontcourt oriented in terms of where the stars were playing.  Back then, Devin Harris was the best PG in the East and his competition was not close at all.  He was competing with Chauncy Billups, Nate Robinson, Derrick Rose and Mo Williams for best PG in the East. Was quite a time.  That said, the SG pool in the East that year was strong. Dwayne Wade, Joe Johnson, Vince Carter, Ben Gordon and Ray Allen."
The talent is there  Just get Joe Harris and Seth Curry off the bench
"I love the hawks but the nets role players aren’t bad. Joe Harris is solid, Blake is solid, mills is solid, and other teams I didn’t mention like the bulls and (god forbid) the wolves could have a shot at beating you. Also people will plan for you more after your incredible run  3-5 seed, and I would guess 4"
"LeBron  KD  Harden  AD  Kyrie   Russ  Joe Harris  -------  The rest below that are a toss up imo, could be Nunn / Griffin / Aldridge / Monk / Melo / Dwight etc etc"
"As a Laker fan, I would put Harden over AD for now. At least based off last season. I think your Top 7 is pretty accurate. Joe Harris is the cut off point, anyone below that is a toss up and pretty equal in skill level imho."
KD Bron Harden AD Kyrie Russ Joe Harris  Nunn  Blake griffin  Patty Mills
Joe Harris might be the most overrated player in this league currently
Lol get out at Russ could be worse than Joe Harris
"Playoff regression aside, Joe Harris is more valuable than Blake imo."
(Regular season) Joe Harris number 7
"&gt; Do you honestly think LeBron would have went to the Lakers had they did not clean up front office?   Yes, of course, he was going to LA regardless.  You go into these super long irrelevant tangents and I don't get it. Jordan, Ballmer, MIKE TYSON? LOL dude this is so irrelevant it's incredible.  You're comparing Wiggins and Tobias Harris to LeBron hahahahahahaha holy shit!  &gt;I'm sure you think that one All-star break where Kyrie and KD spoke to each other is when they decided to team up right?  No I'm sure it was even earlier actually. Probably more like December is when Kyrie decided  Can't wait for a rant about Joe Smith or something next. Dude LeBron does what he wants and others adapt, it's not the other way around."
"Blake, Joe Harris, Nic Claxton, LMA, Mills, and Brown are all solid players who compliment the big three well, but they're not a second unit who'll win you games without those three IMO. And after those guys, the depth gets really poor."
Also kind of the perimeter equivalent of this(Kyle Korver/Joe Harris type of players)
but he's never been a 3pt shooter. Dunc is that guy. This guy is closer to a Clarkson/Lou Will than Joe Harris/Korver. Its like none of yall actually watch anyone who isnt your team play lol.
He's a volume scorer. He's more like a Jordan Clarkson than a Joe Harris. Taking a lot of tough shots. He definitely had a bad 21 playoffs but people are acting like he had this huge sophomore slump that he didn't have. He was also banged up a lot and every time he got back in rhythm he seemed to get hurt.
"I'd say this was basically like Joe Harris against the Bucks this year, but even worse"
Go traditional Brooklyn... Big 3. James Johnson. Nicolas Claxton. Save the bodies of Blake and LaMarcus for the playoffs. Bruce Brown starting is laughable. Save Joe Harris and the Big 3 for end of games.
"I paid for tickets for the Nets vs Jazz game. Cost twice as much as normal Jazz tickets. The Nets only played one starter, Joe Harris, and were down 30 in the first quarter..."
Joe Harris pulled a Harrison Barnes
"I mean I’m fully on board with where you’re going, we are a shitshow. Doesn’t mean joe harris didn’t single handedly choke away a series"
"At least nobody's paying Simmons to hit 3s. Joe Harris got paid millions to do basically nothing but shoot 3s, and he magically forgot how to do that against the Bucks"
"It makes sense that LaMarcus can't play too much, joe harris has been a disappointment so gonna bench him"
"Last year the nets used the regular season to experiment by constantly trying out different starting 5s and bench unit.  I’d fully expect that to be true for next year as well. If our starting 5 offense is already elite without Joe Harris, why not put in a better defender that’s fantastic at being the cutting and finishing around the rim and have Joe add offense off the bench."
"I would start Joe Harris for spacing purposes, but if he’s still gonna shoot like Andre Roberson then might as well start Bruce."
Joe Harris stock down bad
"I also went to Atkinson, Vaughn, and Nash and demanded to start over Joe Harris.   This was after the Harden trade.   My thinking was mostly that a big three is cute but a big four is god tier.  Had Schiffer done his research he wouldnt have buried the real headline here"
"Games aren't played on paper, especially not in one on one matchups   KD is probably the best player in that series, with lebron a slight number two over harden, AD is 4 with kyrie over Westbrook, but that in itself doesn't say much   The finals will be won on the margins  Do the Lakers have enough 3 point shooting?  Do the nets have enough rim protection   Who has the better adjustments throughout the series  Does Joe Harris have another slump?  Will Dwight be able to spell AD at the 5 for 20 mins a game?"
Is this Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris interviewing him?
"Mavs offense was great because their shooters were hitting 50% from 3 for like 4 games. When it was in the 38% range their offense was way worse.  And again Kawhi's ""30 ppg on better efficiency!"" stats don't come vs Dallas offense. It comes vs their defense, which is far far worse. Bucks offense was shooting horrible tho. They're usually better than that, but still their defense was what made them win against everyone. Nets could've won if KD had even Joe Harris playing average.  And again West is tougher can be brought to the argument, that is if actually you play more than 1 and a half round lol."
"Yeah, I think the defense will be an issue for the Nets all season, but once they get in the swing of things, I think that offense will be so good it won't matter (at least in the regular season). Harden will get things turned around once he's back in shape, I don't think Joe Harris will continue shooting this bad, and Durant is the best player on either team. But with the Lakers, I just really don't like their roster construction.  Their defense is just as bad as the Nets', but I don't have faith that their offense can turn things around in a meaningful way. Bringing in Russ was a mistake; their spacing is a mess and I don't have faith in Vogel coming up with the offensive sets to offset their issues. Both teams will inevitably sign buyout guys, though, so we'll see what these rosters end up looking like later this season. But for now, I'm much more worried about the Lakers than I am the Nets."
"no shit.. but they don't have 40mil to throw around   they have kyrie instead  and with a 3rd max player, they have no choice but use guys that are super cheap. Same goes for the lakers.   but compared to the lakers, nets actually have some good players like Joe Harris. Mills/griffin/LMA/milsap are also solid depth pieces."
No because healthy Harden rn &gt; 2013 Harden  KD is still dominant  Obviously Kyrie is better than his 2013 self  Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are on the team  Patty Mills still does what he needs to do
"nets seem like they don't have a lot of depth  joe harris is OK but I wouldn't feel comfortable relying on him  blake griffin only does so much these days  patty mills is hot and cold  millsap and LMA are old and play very limited minutes  They definitely don't look like the world beaters everybody was projecting.  Even if harden gets back to how he was last season they're still gonna have poor depth  They need to get the kyrie situation resolved, either get him back on the floor or get his contract off the books and bring someone else in"
"Joe Harris and mills are meh?   Griffin, Milsap, Aldridge, Claxton, brown are all good too"
I was really high on Joe Harris until last year's playoffs
I am not going to say the heat didn't contest shots but the nets had open looks. Mills alone missed a bunch of wide open 3s in like a 2 or 3 min span. Joe Harris also missed a few open ones as did KD and Millsap. Particularly that 3 when Mills threw it to KD behind the back.  A couple of those go in and we have a tight 4th quarter finish. KDs bail out 3pter in the 4th cut it 3...like I said it goes both ways.  The heat contested the nets at the rim very well.
Their starting line up has been awful.  Joe Harris and Harden and to lesser extent Blake been awful
"They kinda had no other chance. Combine KD, Harden and Kyrie's salaries (Joe Harris too) and you don't really have that many options other than aging veterans/ring chasers who will play for the minimum. LeBron teams have usually been put together that way too."
"We are looking like a top 4 west team right now. Without 2 starters in Klay and Wiseman. All I am personally expecting from Klay is 20 minutes a night with efficient shooting while not being a defensive liability.  Does not need to even be All-Star level for us to be a contender. We have Poole, Wiggins and a rando bench player to pick up his slack. Let’s just use his floor, Joe Harris. He averages around 14 PPG, I can guarantee that Wiggins and Poole will score that almost every night, and average more than that in a season. I also believe both Green and Wiseman can get at least 8 per night. Thats 58 points minimum and for me that’s a safe estimate. Without adding Curry, Bjelica, Porter, Iguodala or the surprise scoring contributor like Kuminga, Looney Lee or Moody. The main goal should be to get Wiseman to be a good shot blocker and neutral defender."
he needed to get more criticism for playing joe harris over landry shamet against the bucks in the playoffs
Considering Patty Mills &amp; Joe Harris are on the team that shouldn't really be the case
"Could have swore, Joe Harris was someone else"
Joe Harris is worse than useless in the clutch lol  He always makes a bad play somehow
# joe harris is an aliexpress klay
Joe Harris is so unclutch for how high his 3P% is
That dude called Joe Harris best 3pt shooter ever???? Turning this shit off right now
Joe Harris also was a fan favorite in dc
"oh no, joe harris is gonna take jason kidds only NBA record"
Joe Harris the 18mil jumpshooter w/ no jumpshot anymore
"Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Blake Griffin, LMA, and Claxton is more than good enough to win a title with KD and Harden."
The whole Cavs team road the subway… JayZ did for the first time he performance… Joe Harris did… Spider-Man has…
"Well that’s off a bit, Harden+KD will make over $90m next season.  Cap is going to be under $120m and Joe Harris will still be on the books, even if you got a team to take Joe Harris without sending money back that still not enough to offer more than around $20m to a FA since empty roster spot holds are nearly $1m (each empty roster spot under 13 has the cap hold rule applied)  https://hoopshype.com/salaries/brooklyn_nets/"
tbf joe harris is literally the most generic looking dude imaginable lol
"I agree with this assessment.    I think context is very important.  Lots of die hard Knicks fans.  And tons of them at MSG.  But we are not talking about MSG.  When you take the segment of group of people you want to classify as diehard Knicks fans and compare them to the whole NYC population, they are a small group.  So most players can travel and take the subway easily.  I posted elsewhere here that Joe Harris says he takes the subway, Jordan Montgomery (of the Yankees) takes the subway 'daily' to the stadium."
"&gt; harden is playing terribly  Which is the reason for why the offense is struggling, when Harden plays better, the Nets offense will get better, KD doesn't really affect his team's ORating, he gets his points regardless, but he doesn't create opportunities for others like Harden does.   Harden is the guy who gets Joe Harris easy 3s, who makes Bruce Brown look useful etc."
"[Link](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/11/joe-harris-brooklyn-nets-subway-cleveland-lebron)  You def can take the train.  Here is an article about Joe Harris (Nets) and Jordan Montgomery (Yankees, does it 'daily' to the stadium).  [Link](https://gothamist.com/food/brooklyn-nets-player-deandre-jordan-loves-taking-the-subway-dunkins-new-beyond-meat-breakfast-sandwiches)  DeAndre Jordan used to take the subway.  I had seen Ron Darling on the 7.  I knew who he was.  No one bothered him.  He was talking to a fellow announcer whose name alludes me now."
Joe Harris has been ice cold to start the season. Hope he can turn it around  And^not^just^for^fantasy^reasons
Joe Harris the best shooter in the league ofc
"Low key Kennards contract might be a bargain judging on what Duncan Robinson, joe Harris and Bertrans got"
Friendship ended with Joe Harris  Now Patty Mills is my best friend
Joe Harris should absolutely not be driving to the basket lol
"Both Joe Harris and Patty Mills 3pt form will regress to the mean, but in the end Nets could have 2 great shooters for the season."
Joe Harris still in playoff mode I see
Joe Harris is 6/22 (27%) from downtown since the start of the season.
"this mfer joe harris got the yips or some shit, Joe ""Yipman"" Harris"
 Joe Harris does not deserve a contract in the National Basketball Association  edit: nvm but he's on thin ice
"There were a few better options around where Bruno got picked. Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Kyle Anderson were all late first round picks in 2014 too, and then there was Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, and Jordan Clarkson in the second round. Obviously some of those picks are excusable because of how little hype they had, but still."
Yes he was impact.    Not every team has to be a superstar that carries teams far into the playoffs to be good in this league. What kind of trash ass logic is that    Joe Harris is one the very best shooters in the league and has been an elite role player for years.
Yeah and the nets missed the playoffs every year before KD and Kyrie or were first round sweeps. Joe Harris was that impactful huh? Stop the cap 🧢
"We got to stop hyping up rookies like Cam who are never gonna make a difference in their rookie years for a contending team.   Aldridge, Blake and Mills their only stand outs. But Blake is more of a starter.   Claxton and Joe Harris definitely overrated in the way Nets fans spoke about them."
"I think they lack depth at the 3 but then again most teams have that issue.  They can stagger KD and Joe Harris accordingly in the playoffs to make up for that. They can also get some spot minutes at the 4 from players like Millsap, Griffin and LMA to compensate."
Who's your other pick? Joe Harris? Did you see him shat the bed on the playoffs last year lol
What happened to Joe Harris
He's so underpaid lmao. When I see Joe Harris and a few other shooters I'm shocked curry has that contract!
Joe Harris is a deep state agent sent to destroy the Nets.
Hopefully he shit talks Joe Harris
Harden is getting back into the swing of things and I’m not worried about him.  What I don’t know is what the use of Joe Harris is if he’s gonna be out there for nearly 30 mins and only hit 1 three. And nearly foul out. That man forgot how to play basketball.
"Damn, Joe Harris seems to have fallen off a cliff! Is he in his own head after the playoffs?"
Joe Harris is ASS. omg.
if joe harris isn’t splashing threes he’s useless
Playoff Joe Harris has arrived
Joe Harris makes 17M this season and isn’t worth a dime. LMAO
"On principle I agree with you. And it's possible Paul's shooting motion last night was natural. I found a video of him practicing threes and he does land about a foot forward when he's shooting threes in the gym. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOrTY\_oMnyE  If you watch the three point competitions though, where there's no incentive to draw contact, it does seem like most shooters' (Curry, Tatum, Thompson, Booker, Harden, Hield, Lowry) natural shot has them landing only a few inches in front of where they jumped, with both feet landing together. The exceptions to this, aside from Chris Paul, are JJ Reddick and Joe Harris. Those guys land like a foot forward from where they shoot from."
The nets certainly could’ve offered him backup 2 spot or to be honest I’d rather see him in the starting lineup with Harden and Kyrie instead of Joe Harris most days
Joe Harris is up there
"Which young players played with LeBron long enough to get good and experienced enough to be championship level players?  BI and Lonzo were both great on the Lakers with LeBron, they have progressed pretty linearly since then.   Caruso was absolutely amazing with LeBron.   So was Dellavedova. Hell LeBron even got something out of Norris Cole in his first couple of years.   One notable player who made huge strides after leaving a LeBron team is Joe Harris but how many rookies are actually effective in this league to be  great addition to a team in win now mode?"
I guess I'll take him and ad that's honestly a bargain for Joe Harris
"Kyrie, claxton, joe Harris, cam Thomas, James Johnson for Lebron"
"Huge comeback win for the Nets...its shocking that the Sixers lost this. KD was KD and Aldridge saved their asses, along with Danny Green. Thank god, since Joe Harris is already in playoff form. 🙃  Still, I'm worried for them cuz the Sixers weren't even at full strength. Idk how they're gonna get out of the east having to go thru these guys and the Bucks again without Irving."
You do know we have Joe Harris right no disrespect to Joe I love him but he has choked
"Then you're either an above average NBA player's alt or delusional lmao, the only Nets with at least 1000 minutes to put up better numbers than him last year were KD, Harden, Kyrie, and arguably Harris, tho Brown does lead him in WS/48 and most defensive metrics by a decent amount, and Brown had significantly better number than the likes of Shamet, TLC, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Tyler Johnson, Prince, etc."
"Random thoughts  BRK defense is awful, their interior defense especially so, Claxton is cheeks rn, why they didnt sign a decent center this past offseason is beyond me  2 game sample size but BRK's offense looks better with Harden on the bench, big yikes atm and mildly concerning going forward  Joe Harris in playoff form rn  Patty Mills signing was one of the best offseason moves, dude brings shooting, perimeter D, and poise, all sorely needed   Harden Iso become less effective when the defenders not worried about getting called for a ticky/flop foul  Hardens lack of off ball movement is a problem, gums up/kill a lot actions because he just floats around the top of the key 3 point line, needs to work on back cutting for ez layups when defenders overplay him  If Kyrie doesnt come back KD's gonna have to hard carry this team, talk about shit you wouldnt have expected to say to start the season  Millsap and LMA do the same things for this team, why they felt the need to get 2 dudes why they felt the need to get 2 players with so much overlap at a position that isnt super important (the stretch 4-5) is kinda headscratching.  Also BRK needs wings badly, theyves got too many 4-5's and 1-2's.    LMA and Mills were the unsung heroes tonight, ex-Spurs carrying the Nets lmao  BRK has no answer for Embiid other than doubling/trapping on the perimeter or swarming him in the post Maxey looks solid, some  youthful hiccups but i can see why they wanted to keep him, RIP to Simmons lol  Still baffled why Dallas traded Seth, dudes the perfect spacer for any team looking to go on a deep playoffs run, and hes continued to add to his game  Sixers have an actual bench this year,  they wont hemorrhage leads as much when Embiid sit now  Sixers biggest issue imo is consistency, they have a hard time sustaining good play and tend to bounce between good runs and bad runs, their closing play also leaves a lot too be desired, wrong guys taking the shots down the stretch, also wayyyyyyy too many execution errors on both sides of the ball"
seth curry&gt;joe harris
Nets got it close then decided to run the offense through Joe Harris for the next 5 straight possessions
I swear Joe Harris is the least clutch player  Goes like 7/9 from three in blowouts but always misses when the game is remotely close
Joe Harris being Joe Harris
Joe Harris used to be my favorite player on the team. He absolutely sickens me now. Completely fucking useless bum against the top teams. It's undeniable at this point.
Joe Harris is making 17M this season and not worth a dime LOL
Joe Harris complaining like he a superstar
joe harris. not good
Joe Harris is making 17M this season and he isn’t worth a single dime LOL
I honestly think it’s all mental for Joe Harris. I feel bad for the guy.
I don't think I've watched a nets game where Joe Harris isn't complete shit.
seth curry&gt;joe harris
"need an image of the two strong men shaking hands  ""joe harris, joel embiid - 40% shooters"""
That was a two by joe harris
Playoff Joe Harris is back
Did both teams agree to have Harden and Joe Harris be the only starters playing in Q2 or something?
"No. You’re just flat out wrong. And it’s funny because this is a typical redditor comment, very similar to the fact that last year Joe Harris could perform similar to Klay.   Other sharpshooters get shut down in the playoffs, regardless if they have good teammates: See Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, Kyle Korver etc  Klay would be Klay on any good playoff team, not just because of Steph.   The fact that you think a Duncan Robinson type player could even compare to what Klay has been doing in the playoffs the last 7 years is asinine. He steps his game up, and continues to be one of the clutches players when it matters most"
Yeah every team’s random role players drive to the paint on Brooklyn like they’re prime D Rose. And Joe Harris’ defense is putrid at this point.
"Sorry that the Sixers don’t want your scraps for an all star dpoy candidate. Malik Beasley, Jaden McDaniels and a couple crappy late picks. Wow yeah! That’s definitely not wasting Embiids prime. Those two players literally add nothing to our team. We have Maxey, Isaiah Joe, Korkmaz and Seth Curry who all play a similar shooting guard role to beasley. So if we trade for him it literally just pushes one of our good young role players who are in need of development out of the roster for a player who is not that much better. Yes beasley averaged 19 last year but he adds nothing new to our team that we need and he only averaged that much cuz kat and dlo were out for most of the season. He isn’t taking 16 shots a night at the Sixers. Jaden McDaniels, sure he’s an good young prospect but his ceiling isn’t that high and we have Tobias Harris and George’s Niang who are both better than him. Niang shoots 40% + from 3. So McDaniels would be lucky to even be in the bench rotation. In conclusion, we get nothing"
"This is like arguing for a better version of Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson to be included. They’re elite at what they do but they aren’t in the conversation with LeBron or Steph. Klay is an unreal shooter, but it really does matter that he always shares the floor with the best shooter to ever live and a perennial dpoy candidate, and has arguably never even been the second best player on a championship team."
Came here to say Joe Harris. Pretty sad that they were teammates on  the Cavs until they saw fit to cut him.
Joe Harris
As an Atlanta sports fan we could win the title and it would only be because Joe Harris stubbed his toe or some shit
"LOL y’all are the last ones to talk about playing half a team. Don’t forget James Harden and Kyrie Irving, that was 2/3 the Nets gone. Joe Harris was also ice cold."
Well my Third string team  AKA benchwarmers would be    Pg. Luka Sg. Carsuo SF. Joe Harris PF. Poku C. Jokic
"Well if it was Luka, Jokic, Caruso, Kevin Huerter, Poku, Joe Harris, Kevin Love then the questions would be all serious and nobody would be trolling. But When AD came on here there was nothing but trolls ... hmm I wonder why that is"
Trash Teams/Trash players    . Mavs . Nuggets . Pacers . Alex Caruso  . Porinzgos .kevin Heurter . Joe Harris . Poku
Joe Harris didn’t average 4 points ppg lol
So is Joe Harris a trash offensive player as well then?
I don’t think we’d take Allen for Joe Harris straight up.
We’ve got enough we only need a few to be useful. Aldridge can be useful against a team like the sixers. James Johnson is a decent Giannis defender over his career. My main gripe was Bruce brown not getting any chances. Millsap definitely looks washed I will say.   Joe Harris still needs to be covered as a threat he’s always useful even if he’s not hitting shots.
"Joe Harris is a good asset because even when his shot isn't falling (which to be fair, isn't that often) he still gives ""gravity"""
Unless they trade away Joe Harris I don't think they can realistically upgrade at the 5. Nobody on the buyout market will really be an upgrade over Blake/Millsap/LA.  The bigger issue is that their team barely has any + defenders so there isn't just 1 player who can turn around their defensive woes.
They didn’t look too good last night.  Milsap and Aldridge looked washed  Joe Harris is a clear liability when he isn’t hot from three  They had guys like Jevon Carter and James Johnson playing rotational minutes
"Joe Harris and Nic Claxton for Ayton, pls say yes."
*Looks only at +-*  Hey my man Joe Harris was neutral
"He'd fit great in Brooklyn with KD and Harden. IMO the Nets should trade Kyrie to the Lakers for Russ, Claxton to the Clippers for Ibaka, and Joe Harris to ESPN for Kendrick Perkins."
I’d be passing the ball more to Joe Harris and KD than pj tucker and Westbrook.
"depth wise, I expected joe harris and patty to still be good enough to fill o up for 15+ a night if KD OR harden have an off night, im surprised it hasnt really shown so far."
Reminds me of Joe Harris when he was with UVA. Great 3 point shooter but doodoo at the FT line. Don't know if he has improved that in the NBA though.
"KD with a one-legged Harden took the eventual champion Bucks to 7, and KD was one shoe size away from eliminating the Bucks despite Joe Harris forgetting how to play basketball  People are mad for doubting KD after what he did last year in the playoffs"
Blake and Millsap are just plain bad this season. LMA is good offensively but deffensively he gets killed on switches against good guards. Joe Harris (injured rn) is supposed to be good although he choked hard and forgot how to shoot last playoffs. Patty is great though.   I think the Nets have a good shot at the title without Kyrie if Mils and Harris are healthy and in good form and if Claxton delivers as a mobile big man who can guard switches.
and my man joe harris got cold in playoffs
He’s right. They’ve got guys like Bembry and James Johnson taking up minutes lmao.   They need to trade Joe Harris ASAP
They got Joe Harris too  This team can win a ring with a max player sitting at home doing nothing
"We at least know he can still be a dangerous shooter so even if he's not able to play good defense, he'll still be able to play some sort of JJ Redick, Kyle Korner, Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris type role."
Also with Kyrie and Joe Harris not playing he’s pretty much free to take as many shots as he wants. KD doesn’t take a crazy amount of shots he just doesn’t miss lol.
After Joe Harris and Bruce got injured. He played really well against the Cavs and has been getting minutes since then. He also provides more on the offensive end than Jevon does.
Blake? LaMarcus? Joe Harris? Millsap? they’re stacked they just ass
"No one is gonna leave klay in a corner to shoot threes, buddy. I disagree, I don't think his floor is Joe Harris at all. I think his floor might be Parsons or Michael Redd."
and what are you basing this off of? You haven't seen him play since the injury. Why does he need to create that much separation if his bread and butter is catch and shoot 3's??? He doesn't need to dribble my guy. Post injury Klay's floor is Joe Harris. Joe Harris would be a big contributor on any team.
"Joe Harris is out. Claxton is out. LMA is decent. Injuries to key players and Kyrie not playing is hurting their depth. They really aren't scrubs like you make them out to be. If Harden can just play like James Harden, there bench won't even matter in the regular season."
"Not that I disagree with what you said but I think the original commenter was saying there *is* a gap (although small) between Duncan and Bertans. I feel like Duncan Robinson (and Joe Harris) have gone through slumps but the difference is they can still hang (sometimes barely, but they hang) on defense. Some of that comes from playing for coaches who demand it of them but some of it also comes from them just being very high-motor guys. Unfortunately, Bertans just doesn't apply, or is not capable of, the defensive effort required to still be ""ok"" when the shot is not falling."

"The preseason assumption about the Warriors given last year was that Steph just didn't have a co-star and that single-star teams don't achieve this level of success. There was then going to be a need for the full splash-bros to reappear for them to have a chance vs a Lebron/AD or a KD/Harden. Draymond actually giving a shit again and Wiggins/Poole playing well has made it where I feel we can contend even without Klay. Imagine Klay is a shell of his former self and he's then way over paid and he's essentially a Joe Harris shooter.  You're still adding a role player with a super valuable skill to the #1 seed in the west. The fact that Klay is supposedly looking pretty good and may return in a couple weeks, I feel they can make a run for 65 wins. We will take care of the Suns, you guys take care of the Nets and lets agree to meet in the Finals. There's not two guys I root for more than Steph and Giannis so bring on the Champs!"
"Patty Mills and Joe Harris coming on strong too, but you won't see Nets praise in this sub, that's for damn sure."
Joe Harris is near the top again despite a very slow start and everyone still says he’s not good and overpaid. Stfu
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5.

"I’m pretty sure every decent team in the east qualifies except for the Hornets and Hawks.   - Nets have Kyrie and Joe Harris - Bulls have Ball and Caruso - Heat have UD - Wizards have Harrell, Kuzma, and KCP - Bucks have George Hill and Rodney Hood - Knicks have Derrick Rose - Sixers have Drummond and Danny green - Cavs have Love - Celtics have Schroeder   So yeah I agree I think the streak most likely stays alive this year one way or another."
Duncan en Joe harris do not belong in the same sentence as Bertrans.
"The Nets had a terrible roster the year they made the Playoffa vs the 76ers so idk how anyone can blame Joe Harris for playing poorly against a team that was a Kawhi bounce away from the Finals.   The Nets literally had a washed up Jared Dudley as their starting PF for that series with a young skinny Jarrett Allen and old Ed Davis as “Bigs” since they were the only 2 players 6’10” with nobody 7ft on the roster.   Once the Nets lost Dudley and Davis to injuries their depth was shot and Rodions Kurucs became the new starting PF and backup C with 6’5” Treveon Graham as the only other PF.    That roster was terrible outside of D’Lo, Dinwiddie, and LeVert for Guard Depth. Hell that was the series that Embiid/Simmons were laughing at Jarrett Allen because he was too young and skinny to defend the paint and was only able to block random shots.   Even as bad as that roster was till my death I’ll always believe if Jared Dudley and Ed Davis didn’t get injured that series was headed to 6 or 7 games."
Joe harris wouldn't willing give harden his mana earlier in the season
Joe Harris used to make very little money.
"Holy shit, you must be either stupid or malicious to watch that game and think that Luka was trying to stat pad. No one in our starting lineup can shoot, dribble, or make plays other than Luka.   Should we have let Dellavadova and Mozgov get more chances at running plays during the 2015 NBA Finals so that they could get themselves going? Should we have just forced Lebron to dump the ball to Kevin Love in the 2017 Finals over and over until he got himself going? Should we have said fuck it, let Joe Harris and a hobbled Harden take turns initiating the offense last playoffs?"
I hattttttte joe Harris
" Joe harris has missed a lot of games, don’t act like Blake Griffin isn’t cooked,LMA hoopin but he’s old Af"
"Wild how a roster of KD, James Harden, Joe Harris, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, and Patty Mills being the 1 seed by one game over the Wizards is considered impressive this year lol"
"&gt; And Lebron mainly plays with old guy  Ingram, Lonzo, Caruso, Jordan Clarkson, Kuzma, Kyrie, Joe Harris  All guys who have a good to decent chance to play in the finals in their careers. Lonzo and Caruso are on a good team, Clarkson is a on a good team, Joe Harris and Kyrie are on good teams. Ingram is playing with Zion. Kuz is on the 3 seed."
Yeah can we not be comparing Grayson Allen to Joe Harris?!? foh
Yeah just seems random. I would love to have either Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson on the Bucks for their current contracts.
The Joe Harris slander is getting out of hand. He's shooting 46% from three this season. He had one bad playoff series.
"Same with Joe, longest tenured Net and was out of the league before finally making a name for himself on the Nets, this is his first big contract.  Also are shooters that pricey? Yea the top tier 3+D guys are but I feel like every team has a couple of sharp shooters that aren't getting paid a ton.  Like the Net's best shooter is Mills whose ""only"" getting paid $6m, you guys have Herro whose getting paid $4m, yea he's on a rookie contract but so are Donte and Pat. Sixers have guys like Curry, Furkan, and Niang. Warriors have Otto, Poole, Damion Lee. Even the Lakers have Melo, Ellington, Nunn, and Monk.  I get this article was a puff piece and KOC isn't really the best journalist, but a lot of thing are a tad iffy in the article, especially when he talks about things Allen and Pat can do and Duncan and Harris cant."
Makes you Joe Harris at worst.
And Joe Harris turns into a scrub in crunch time
The big 3 + Bruce Brown &amp; Joe Harris line up was used for 28 minutes in the playoffs last year (would have been more if not for injuries). It was good.
"Bill Russell weighed less than Joe Harris. If you plug him into 2021 without alteration, he's getting manhandled"
They've lost to the top dogs in the West... Suns and Warriors. And Harden is 💩 right now.. And outside of Patty and Aldridge their bench is pretty thin. And they just lost Joe Harris.   Oh yeah... Kyrie ain't coming back this season.
"At least when it comes to 3pt%, efg%, and ts%, they’re a world apart from one another when you look at them relative to the league.  Tatum’s tied for 47th highest career ts% among active players. Wiggins isn’t in the top 100 and his ts% is 3.26% less than Tatum’s. If Tatum’s ts% was 3.26% higher, he’d rank 15th, ahead of guys like Lebron, AD, Dame, CP3, Butler, Kyrie, Klay, etc.   Tatum ranks 30th in career 3pt% among active players. Wiggins isn’t in the top 100 and his 3pt% is 4.48% below Tatum’s. Add 4.48% to Tatum’s % and he’s 4th among active players with a 43.26% 3pt right behind Steph’s 43.27% in 3rd place. Seth and Joe Harris rank 1st and 2nd.  Tatum’s career efg% ranks 57th among active players. Wiggins’ isn’t in the top 100. His efg% is 3.07% below Tatum’s. If Tatum had a 3.07% higher efg, he’d be 20th in the league ahead of players like KD, Kawhi, Lebron, Kyrie, AD, Harden, CP3 etc"
"Joe Harris actually lost Brooklyn the championship, I'm surprised he was making so much honestly"
Joe Harris doesn't deserve that much. He earns as much as Fred VanVleet.
"Have you watched the games? Eye test says their offense is KD or bust with an every now and then FIBA Mills bursts.      Harden is getting better but....doesn't look super good. Blake is a corpse. LMA is nailing the midranger but can't move on D. Joe Harris is almost back to Cleveland form lmao.       All in all, they don't look like a supernova but they are fine because KD is  Lord Voldemort."
"they nearly beat the bucks last year with harden on one leg, no kyrie, joe harris having a terrible series, and no patty mills or aldridge."
The Lakers can’t make serious moves because of how their salary is set up and the AD deal taking their FRPs. Just small role player moves at best. As for the Nets they also don’t have many picks but they have Joe Harris and Cam Thomas which can get you something.
"Don’t forget Joe Harris, and Aldridge, and Patty Mills."
"Bro what? He almost beat Giannis and the bucks by himself, Harden on one leg, and the ghost of Joe Harris…  KD was the best player in those playoffs and is good for 5 on 5 NBA, whatever that means."
joe harris cost the nets a championship
"Everything I’ve seen is the majority of dubs fans acknowledging the fit of these new players and the subtraction of oubre. You’re joking if you think OPJ, nemanja, Lee, Andre, GPII, etc. were getting praise in the off-season by folks. Meanwhile y’all got certifiable good players with harden and patty (top 6moty candidate), joe Harris, LMA off the bench and claxton after development last year. Not really the same thing"
"Seth Curry and another comparable shooter. Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, Buddy Hield, Bertans, etc."
By going off the context of your post on how championships doesn't make you better. Karl Malone had to verse Mj twice.   But going to main focal part. So wouldn't that derail your whole point of leader ? Giannas took 2 non consistent non all star players that year to the nba finals. While Kd had the second  best pg in the east for 4 games in kyrie before getting hurt. The best 3 point shooter in Joe Harris. With veteran former all stars and couldn't win?   Also giannas had a better efg% and  same ts% They were going neck and neck.
Not to mention the one seed without our 3rd star. We were also missing Joe Harris and Claxton last night. One starter and a heavy rotational player.   I’m not saying we necessarily look like contenders right now but to put us next to the Lakers is laughable.
"Harden is playing poorly. Joe Harris and Claxton have been in and out of the lineup.   All people are saying is the team has been underwhelming, and that’s not because of him specifically"
"Y’all are the No. 1 seed purely on the back of beating bad teams, lmao.  Believe me. No contenders fear those pretenders without Kyrie.   But keep pretending that washed James Harden (one of the biggest chokers in NBA history), Nicolas Claxton (a G-League player) and Joe Harris will be the saviors here, lmao."
He has help. He’s playing next to harden. And joe Harris (who this sub was all about last season). And patty mills. And Aldridge. And Claxton (who this sub was all about last season). And James Johnson. Obviously Kyrie is an insanely massive loss though. Tens of millions out that could be filled by others. But the harden issues are a much larger detriment
Chuck person/ T harris Joe Dumars/CJ **** I didn’t read the whole thing ***** sorry
Chuck person/ T harris Joe Dumars/CJ
Joe Harris and Seth take significantly less shots.
"Nah I totally agree with this. I think the Nets fan base is kinda trash with a ton of casuals and bandwagoners, probably unsurprisingly, who are very quick to hate on their own players.  Look at Joe Harris. Dude is a huge part of the teams success (and honestly part of why they've looked off without him on the floor) and so many causals wanted his head cause he didn't perform well in the Bucks series"
"His overall TS% is very average for someone who takes 15 shots a game and whose only NBA skill is being a shooting threat. Joe Harris is at 0.624, Seth Curry at 0.638, while Buddy sits at 0.569"
Joe Harris has picked up his 3's. He's not playing right now though. LMA and KD as well.
"The same exact team they have now? Harden was hobbled, but still Harden. They had Blake, Jeff Green somehow splashing 3s, and Joe Harris who Middleton shut down. KD was dropping 40 like it was nothing with PJ Tucker and Jrue on him. Nobody can do that but Durant. And who is beating the nets even without Kyrie when KD is playing that well?"
Instead of blackout drunk trying to remain sane during a game 7 OT where Joe Harris misses important shots
"The Nets did get rid of pieces, but it’s about fit. Adding Harden and subtracting Caris (and Dinwiddie due to injury) is easy to do when KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris are excellent shooters off the catch. LeBron and AD aren’t known for their outside shooting, then they went ahead and added the worst volume 3pt shooter ever to that team."
"Pretty easy, champ. Wade was their highest usage player by a mile, and the fouls called were overwhelmingly on his drives (either reach-ins on the perimeter or blocking fouls in the paint).   Most specifically, the phantom foul call in OT Game 5 with the Mavs up 100-99 with two seconds left that sent Wade to the line for two free throws. There are serial instances of players on the Mavericks driving into the restricted area or receiving excessive contact and getting no call (Devin Harris in the 2nd Quarter driving on Shaq, or Dirk in the middle of the fourth in the three-point corner getting bumped and grinded by Shaq into a turnover). Stars and scrubs alike.   Compare this to the minor bump Josh Howard gave that was called with three minutes left in the fourth and Dallas up 4 or the lack of contact evident in Wade’s aforementioned OT drive. Bennett Salvatore and Joe DeRosa both jobbed the Mavericks in multiple key instances in just that game alone (or to put it differently, Joey Crawford grades out as the most Mavs-friendly ref from that game running away, which is a crime in and of itself).   It’s okay that you didn’t watch the series, weren’t born yet, and/or were not yet a fan of the Warriors. But the last four games of this series were a ref job, and Game 5 was the most egregious of them by far. I only provided two examples of discrepancies in identical contact that resulted in divergent results (free throws/foul call for MIA, no call for DAL) at critical junctures.   I would ask you: which finals series comes to mind as the most controversial that you can remember? I promise there is not nearly the background of felony point shaving (Donaghy admitted to betting Heat) or league animus (David Stern hated, hated, hated Mark Cuban and Cuban was fined $250,000 - in 2006! - for anti-ref commentary after Game 5)."
"Lol OK sure. Try Ben simmons (!) tobias Harris, Danny Green all missing major time. Seth curry has missed games as well. We essentially played without any of last seasons starters a few nights ago (and actually won). Also missed thybulle and Joe for 2 weeks. I guess operating with only 7/8 players for half the games this season is a better situation? You must only have abojt 3 players left then"
"Joe Harris, Brooklyn Nets"
"Sean Marks gets a lot of credit for turning around the Nets but it doesn’t happen without Kenny. He played a part in turning around the careers of guys like Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and D’Lo and had Caris LeVert looking like a player who could turn into an all-star (shame he can’t stay healthy)."
And don't forget the bandwagoners who fucking despise Joe Harris. Though idk that I consider them fans as much as opportunists.
"Because we lost to the warriors, down joe Harris Bruce brown claxton and millsap ? Or losing to the bulls on a back to back away on the 5th game of a road trip ?   The difference beteeen the nets and the jazz is that the nets have a legitimate superstar they can turn to in the playoffs. You saw that last year that Durant can carry us pretty far. Also if kyrie is indeed not coming back we will likely be active in the trade and buyout markets. This team isn’t close to being finished."
"Obviously Simmons but lowkey a lot of Sixers fans hate Shake Milton too. He takes dumb shots and has a very low bball iq. He also takes away possessions from better younger players like Maxey and Furkan.   Part of this is Sixers fans love Embiid, Furkan, Niang, Maxey, Seth, Paul Reed, and Isaiah Joe to a borderline irrational extent so anybody else is viewed as lower than them. Even Tobias Harris gets some undeserved hate online."
If his movement and mobility is hindered a bit Klay Thompson could be basically like a taller + better Joe Harris which is still a valuable player who scales exceptionally well with Curry.   We’ll have too see how he’s doing when he returns but he has plenty of time to get back into true playing shape for the playoffs (considering how well Warriors have been without him)
I love Joe Harris. But now I also love Patty
"Shooting. We could really use a third wing who can space the floor at an elite level while not being a huge defensive liability— a 3&amp;D player like Mikal Bridges would be awesome, but even a Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, or Bogdan Bogdanovic type would be fine with our other defensive pieces. People have been overstating our need for playmaking, we've got a bunch of really solid passers (Smart, Schroder, Al, even Tatum when he wants to be) and we'd be averaging more assists if we had guys who could consistently knock down open shots."
Joe Harris
That’s still a good piece I love Joe Harris
I think if klay is just a spot up shooter he’s still effective. But he won’t be the klay Thompson we know then. He’ll be closer to joe Harris type player
"Nets are 12-2 over their last 14. Durant had his one bad game of the season vs GS and they were missing Joe Harris. Very fair to say the warriors are better right now, but in a 7 game series I don't think they're ""eating their lunch"" better. It'd be a good one"
"That's a major undersell. Guys like Luke Kennard, Malik Beasley, Marcus Morris, Bertans, Markkanen, Duncan Robinson, Bojan, Joe Harris, Aaron Gordon are all making 14 mil+. There's no reason Bobby couldn't get that much."
"patty ""joe harris"" mills!!!!"
I'm tempering my expectations defensively because of his injuries but I'm hoping we get a Duncan Robinson/Joe Harris level of play on both ends coming back.
If it’s any consolation we’re down joe Harris Bruce brown and claxton. If Jaylen brown plays I think it’ll be a decent matchup.
joe harris isnt the first player to underperform. you cant rely  on star players either. jrue holiday had a terrible series against us and so did klay thompson many times for the warriors. curry choked in 2016 and so did klay. lebron in 2011. westbrook over his entire career. people have bad series.
"""Joe Harris stole my bit!"" -Harrison Barnes"
Fair point but I dislike this logic. Joe Harris had playoff experience when he went Joe Harris in a pressure situation.
"Eh. He has value, but I wouldn't go so far as to say tremendous. Has no playoff experience, so could go Joe Harris in pressure situations."
Yeah or maybe like a Kevin Love/Tyler Herro/Steve Adams/Luka/Caruso/Joe Harris/Joe Ingles/Duncan Robison with a splash of DiVencenzo
Joe Harris last season was a reminder that you can’t rely on role players to perform in the playoffs no matter how good they look in the regular season
Joe Harris has a pretty low arc and is close to 50% from three
Joe Harris..... the 3pt percentage leader last year and a former 3 point contest champion?
lol Joe Harris and Bruce Brown?
Yeah but I think the problem is they don't have enough other guys that can hit open shots. Joe Harris being out doesn't help and Griffin just looks cooked.
Harden Kd Mills Joe Harris LaMarcus is a good amount of offense
How about the actual best players Kd Joe Harris and mills Aldridge? Ad is good but shooting 14% from 3
Warriors will be happy if klay Thompson plays like joe Harris coming back from those injuries.
Claxton was the most prolific switch defender in the league last year and the best at it.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-brooklyn-nets-could-use-as-many-as-7-centers-but-they-all-bring-something-different/amp/  He was legitimately a gear defensive player last year. You can say what you want but he would’ve been a very good piece to have and is a key part of our defense.   And yeah joe Harris the guy who’s been the #1 3pt shooting player over the last 4 years by %.   Warriors fan base saying wiseman is a key piece when he was one of the worst players in the league last Year but every metric. Then you’re relying on a guy who hasn’t played in two years and is likely a walking injury from here on out in klay.  At this point you guys would be happy if klay was even at the same level as joe Harris lmao
"Lmao Nets fans hyping Claxton up is exactly like how we hyped Jordan Bell up. Please dont actually act like Millsap will make a difference. If anything, dude should be out of the rotation.  Joe Harris? The one who Nets fans on r/gonets cursed at in the playoffs?   ""Not indicative of anything"" Lmao please, go and see how you guys were acting in r/gonets before the game. Nets fans were acting like they were gonna win for sure. If Nets got the W, you wont be saying it's ""not indicative of anything"". Stop this clownery lol"
Lol I was ready to praise DRPM and then I saw Joe Harris at #4 and Duncan Robinson at #10.  Gotta agree with everyone saying there really just isn't any good defensive stat out there
Klay isn’t pulling that kind of choke job that Joe Harris did in a Game 7
Joe Harris
Poor Joe Harris.

"Was 100% onboard with what you said.  It’s just suspect that all but 1 were involved in trades, so people not paying attention would assume dinwiddie was also traded.  A more complete list of defining Nets players would have included Joe Harris.  He’s as much a part of this as anyone."
"That being said, his salary + Joe Harris salary matches a 4th max if they wanted to trade for a 4th max..."
I just don’t like that stars can do this move but if Joe harris tried it or some shit he’d get called for it every single time
He's obviously talking about three point shooting champion Joe Harris.
i dont understand this train of thought. Look at how Tilman broke ass treat his team. We have a top 5 owner in terms of wealth and interest. Lets say Harden/Kyrie/KD dip after two years. We literally have nobody on the books outside of Joe Harris. We could easily sign some people and still be a better team then the rockets.
"Forgot about Joe Harris, but I still like the construction of the 76ers team better assuming they give up Simmons, Maxey, and Thybulle plus picks for Harden. The Nets team has a better offense, but are way worse defensively. As for Dwight, I'd take him over both Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan. He played good minutes for the Lakers during the playoffs. DeAndre Jordan is pretty washed up imo and only reason why he's still on the team is because he's friend with Kyrie and KD. Jeff Green is pretty limited as a player. Beyond that the rest of the team is pretty thin especially with Dinwiddie out."
"You mention Seth, Danny Green, Milton and Dwight as part of the Sixers core but for the Nets Joe Harris is a G leaguer?? And is Dwight even better than Jeff Green or DeAndre Jordan at this point?"
"Kyrie top 5? That’s questionable at best in my opinion, regardless of him actually being available to play which is rare  E: unless you meant Durant, Harden, and Joe Harris ye"
"i think if they stagger their big 3 they will have a shot. joe harris is a great player, and i think they are a better team than everyone except the lakers, and maybe the clippers . i don’t think they’re a lock to win, but they have a very real chance"
"Joe Harris for Klay Thompson, who says no?"
It is pretty hard to make moves without picks. He's got Kyrie and Joe Harris as assets to move. Championship windows in the NBA are like two years unless you're LeBron. Warriors lasted four
"I think if they somehow manage to get a good 3 and D guy as well, then they should make the finals ahead of Bucks. Right now they have Joe Harris and Shamet, great shooters but are they good defenders? I expect Harden to get better at defense while having more playmaking duties on the Nets. Also, a lot depends on if Jordan can stay healthy. So, a lot of question marks right now, but I´d say they´ll be a 2 seed and will reach the finals just to fall short against the Lakers."
"Okay, and Steph Curry and Klay are more efficient shooters than Joe Harris and Kyrie. Just because Harris is shooting 50% on a small sample size doesn't mean the     Nets are all the sudden more ""efficient"" than the KD Warriors."
"It’s more efficient than the Warriors. Joe Harris is shooting 50% from 3 and is about to get even more open. Kyrie typically shoots over 40%. And then you have James fucking Harden. DeAndre Jordan, if he decides to start being good again was one of the most efficient scorers for years."
They probably move Joe Harris to the 3 and KD to the 4. KD will have to bang with bigger bodies all season which will cause some wear and tear. They don’t have a bench at the moment.
"They’re going to be the most efficient team of all time, pretty easily. Joe fucking Harris is currently shooting 50% from 3 and he’s about to be getting like 10 wide open 3s a game from Harden"
"I'm mainly talking about the starting lineup. Kyrie, Joe Harris, Harden, KD, and Jordan is not a good defense in the slightest."
Joe Harris
Mike Scott chasing joe Harris around screens
"&gt; Their strategy of leaving people open for three isn't going to work against the Nets though lmao  That's usually because of the bigs that can pop since Brook can't step up and drop fast enough. And if Joe Harris or Jeff Green beats them instead of the big trio, that's a win for the Bucks defense I'd say.  On the other hand, idk whose lifeforce Nets will drain to get DeAndre to play 30+ meaningful minutes."
"Well on the plus side for them, they're going to be preeminent favorite to get whoever is bought out because they have playing time and open roster spots up for grabs.   I think your team is the only one that stands a chance because of Embiid, however I'm not sure you have enough perimeter scoring from the likes of Seth Curry/Shake/Maxey/Tobias to win 4 out of 7 vs. this team.   Like Jeff Green, for all his notable flaws as a player, isn't actually THAT bad as a man defender, he did a very good job on Giannis in their game last year in the bubble, and if you look at how much Crowder gave Giannis trouble, you can imagine Jeff Green being able to pose the same problem.   When push comes to shove at the end of games, they are probably going to switch 1-5, which is why they probably need one more 3&amp;D wing as Joe Harris is probably too much of a defensive liability on quick guards. However, I won't put it past them to get like, a Trevor Ariza, or somebody of that ilk."
"I get you. I doubt anyone gives a shit about wanting to beat ""1"" player out of the 500 or so in the NBA. At the end of the day, it's just a game and for most players, it's all about making money. For some, legacy, stats, and accolades are part of the equation.   I think I'd be happier being a Joe Harris, JJ Reddick, or a 15th man on a bench getting the best seats in the house over a Lebron, Michael, Magic, etc."
Joe Harris better still get his looks
Their bench is still better than 60% of the leagues benches. If yiu bring Joe Harris off the bench along with Bruce Brown and TLC its a more than adequate bench
"That's true but Oladipo is probably the best free agent this summer. Teams might be bidding for him. Plus Duncan Robinson is a free agent and he's going to get a Joe Harris deal. I don't know if they're going to have enough cap space to have both of them. There's a chance that they might have to let Duncan walk in order to sign Oladipo and a team comes out of nowhere and gives Oladipo a monster deal. We saw with Gordon Hayward, Charlotte came out of left field. Hayward was in a similar spot to Oladipo coming off a major injury."
Definitely is. Also Joe Harris at 50% on around 75 attempts is pretty good.
Every day I feel worse for Joe Harris. That man deserves better I fear
"Joe Harris in a lineup with KD, Harden, and Kyrie might close the gap"
Malcolm Brogdon  KCP  Joe Harris  PJ Tucker    Brogdon isn’t really a role player but if he doesn’t have some decent offensive guard then no Shaq team is winning shit
Harden is even fatter than Dončić and Kyrie is in Crazyland. I guess 2nd Option is Joe Harris and 3rd ...ehhh... Spender Dinwiddie?
"Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Paul Reed, mike Scott, Dakota Mathias, Tobias Harris...its like all our players"
"Nah Joe Harris is Duncan Robinson. Kyrie gets the lofty ""Tyler Herro"" role."
"Have u seen KD outside the warrriors when he’s the main ball distributor, he’s a below average defender. Harden can’t play perimeter D but he’s good for a guard in the post and kyrie is one of the worst defenders in the league. Take into account DJ being terrible and joe Harris being average, you have a D that’s a little better than the wizards"
That’s fine. The only other player deserving of double digit shot attempts on this team is Joe Harris
"&gt;The fact that you’re comparing the Cavs who had Kyrie and Kevin Love to Ingram and Kuzma tells me all I need to know lol.  There are so many things you need to know, but do not.  You are forgetting a bunch of players, and assuming the Lakers would've kept all those assets instead of packaging them for players -- like the examples I gave.  &gt;Also the fact you’re comparing trading for Anthony Davis to trading Joe Harris for CASH is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard.  Like I said, educating you seems completely hopeless.  Here are the two seminal examples of my point.  I doubt you will understand them, but here goes anyway.  In October of 1976, Portland traded 20 year-old Moses Malone to Buffalo for a single 1978 1st round pick that became Rick Robey.  Portland went on to win the championship that season.  You may have heard of Moses Malone, he went on to play 20 seasons.  Robey, suffice it to say, did not.  Portland lost that trade by an immense margin, despite winning the title that year.  In September of 1979, the Los Angeles Lakers traded 24 year-old future Hall-of-Famer Adrian Dantley to Utah for 30-year-old future Hall-of-Famer Spencer Haywood.  That didn't seem outlandish at the time, but Haywood barely played for the Lakers, wasn't better than Dantley, and was out of the league two years later.  While Dantley went on to lead the league in scoring twice, and rack up over 20,000 more points and six All-Star selections over 12 seasons.  Again, Los Angeles lost that trade, despite winning the title that season.  Do you understand now?"
"Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, KD, Tucker seems solid"
The fact that you’re comparing the Cavs who had Kyrie and Kevin Love to Ingram and Kuzma tells me all I need to know lol.  Also the fact you’re comparing trading for Anthony Davis to trading Joe Harris for CASH is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve ever heard.   Let me ask you one very simple question before I leave. If you’re Lakers GM Would you still make the AD trade knowing everything you know now yes or no
"&gt;No give me an exact example: what year did LeBron win with less talent than what the 2018-2019 Lakers would have been.  Cleveland.  &gt;You keep saying I’m missing your point and I’m not.  You are missing the point entirely.  The point is not about what happened with this specific trade.  &gt;I can point to the fact that the Lakers won the title last season and AD played a crucial role as proof of my statement  No, you cannot, because that's not proof.  Even if it were, you are still completely missing the point.  It appears completely hopeless to try and get you to understand anything, but I will try again.  Imagine the Brooklyn Nets wake up tomorrow morning and trade Joe Harris to Detroit for cash considerations.  They go on to win the championship this year anyway.  Did the Nets win that trade?  Of course not.  No one in their right mind would trade a useful player, never mind an excellent shooter, for nothing.  Just because a team wins a title, does not mean they automatically won every transaction that preceded that win."
"Hell yea, The Nets big 3 of Harden, Durant and Joe Harris are fierce"
"People here treating Joe Harris, the walking three, as this non existent entity. If you double two players on the Nets and keep a man glued to Harris that leaves two players on their own lol"
He literally said whoever isn't Joe Harris or the 3 stars is back on defense.
"Even if your idea was smart, which is not. Joe harris is by far their best catch and shoot player and offball player., he's the last guy you leave behind in that offense."
"Their depth isn’t that bad though.  Kyrie/Harden/KD/Green/Jordan is an outstanding starting 5.  Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan are weaker starters, but decent vet role players, and the big 3 is insane.  Joe Harris is a good 6th man.  And then other guys like Shamet, TLC, Bruce Brown, etc. are decent bench players.  Also, I’m sure they get the odd buyout ring chaser as the season goes on.  Off-court stuff is a big risk.  Kyrie is a complete wildcard, and KD and Harden are both primadonnas.  But if they can keep the locker room functional, and stay healthy, I think they’re strong championship contenders this year, and even stronger next year, with an offseason to stock up on ring chasers."
Joe Harris is the 3rd option.
Our depth is fine it's our big man rotation that's ass. We still have Joe Harris Jeff green tlc Bruce brown shamet. Those are decent players to have around 3 stars.
The salaries don't work. It would need to include Joe Harris' contract and they don't have the depth to be trading away Joe Harris.
"I wouldn't call the Nets' 3-8 ""really fucking good."" I'm trying to figure out who their closing 5 is. Can you play Kyrie, Joe Harris, Harden, and Durant together? DeAndre Jordan at the 5? Or are you playing Durant at the 5, and then who else?   It would be a lot easier to figure out this Big Three if one of them were a true big man."
"Happy for Joe Harris tbh. He was essentially dumped by the Cavs back in 2016 before he found a home in Brooklyn, hopefully he gets a chance to go deep into the playoffs"
"That season is going to be one of the most memorable.  D'Lo, LeVert, Harris, Kurucs, Allen, Dinwiddie as the top 6. RHJ was still around too.   All ""homegrown"" guys. I put it in quotes because the Nets didn't draft all of those guys, but even the ones they didn't draft themselves were guys who they brought in and developed into very good players who broke out with them.   Then the nice vets like Carroll, Dudley, and Davis who helped the young guys a lot.  Kind of sad that it's basically all gone (with Dinwiddie injured, Joe Harris the only one left right now) even though the current team has the higher ceiling."
Holding onto Joe Harris was a huge W
Joe Harris is Nightwing. Deandre Jordan is Azrael. TLC is Batwing. Spencer Dinwiddie is Batgirl. And Steve Nash is Batwoman.
Joe Harris isn’t better than them but he’s a plus defender for sure. People underrate him on that side all the time   Weird to call him out when Devonte Graham is literally #1
Joe Harris is Green Arrow
"Joe Harris, KD, and Kyrie are all great off ball players. Having multiple elite iso players is not a bad thing. They can just matchup hunt every possession"
"Joe Harris is the best ball handler on this team, prove me wrong"
Joe Harris sprinting for his minutes.
"Joe Harris is #12 haha, ahead of Giannis, AD, etc. What a worthless metric."
\*Joe Harris
Joe Harris went from being dropped by Lebron's Cavs to being a seriously good starter on a team with a prime KD Harden and Kyrie.   If the Nets even think about trading Harris I might riot.
Houston should have asked for Joe Harris
"He was friendly with everyone on golden state to start out with too. Harden had a stretch of like 20 games to start last season where he tried really hard on defense to start the season and everyone took that as him being a good defender. He’s not, he will never be because he is lazy. When has Kyrie been able to guard anyone “well”? He had a good big man to help in the middle so it made him seem like he wasn’t terrible and KD is about average because his height makes him a decent help defender. Fucking Joe Harris is probably their best defender and that is really sad."
People want joe Harris to be a 3&amp;d player but he’s not
Joe Harris seems really good on that end whenever I catch a game
And they still can afford joe Harris
it would need to be like Joe Harris and DeAndre for Drummond for salaries to match
"My turn your turn works well with 2 (eg Lebron-Kyrie) but with 3, the 3rd guy is going to become a spacer/kick out 3 guy.  I think it would work somewhat with Kyrie and Harden as the 2 main ball handlers and KD as the open shooter.  KD shooting open catch and shoot 3s is pretty deadly but it's not going to be the full sum of the parts.  I imagine a lot of teams are going to try and force Joe Harris and the 5th guy (Landry Shamet?) to beat them"
"At wing/guard I’m still ok with our depth. After our big 3 we have Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, TLC, and Jeff Green, plus Shamet and Tyler Johnson that are playable, and Chiozza who is decent but severely limited by his size.   Unless Perry (and Claxton when he comes back from injury) seriously surprise us though, our center situation is FUCKED. Nets will probably be looking to find a starting caliber center somehow before the deadline if they wanna contend this year.   Next year a FA or two, plus getting Dinwiddie back (I think we’ll have to re-sign him but with bird rights), will be the year we really go all in."
"Their future was a gamble,  by the time any of those picks materialize Joe Harris will be in his 30s, Deandre Jordan will be retired, KD will be 35"
No they are not. Curry and harden are comparable and Kyrie is way above klay.  Also joe Harris is an insane offensive role player
"Seriously who is stopping Giannis? I guess that question is asked every year, but two years in a row an elite group of players capable of doing it were there (Lowry, Kawhi, Green, Ibaka, Gasol, and Butler, Bam, Crowder). I don’t even know any Nets players beyond KD, Kai, Harden, DAJ, Shamet and Joe Harris and none of those guys to me are effectively working together to wall off Giannis."
It worked for teams with Kawhi and Gasol and Siakam and Butler and Iggy and Bam. It’s not going to work for Joe Harris and Jeff Green and DeAndre Jordan
"Levert would’ve been a higher pick had it not been injury, that’s a project move the Nets did since we had a long time table. Smart move, good risk assessment. Allen fairly similar as a project guy. D’Lo was a well put together move, many teams didn’t want to touch him.  Those things are calculated risks and good management.   We chose Dinwiddie over Yogi Ferrel, we developed Joe Harris, even a guy like RHJ we traded Plumlee for to get a developmental type of guy. Many long term moves that culminated with putting together these star players.   You are incredibly short sighted if you think it was just lucky hits in the draft (where we had the Celtics scraps btw). How about the poison pill contracts to build up assets? So many long term moves and creative shit Marks has been doing.    The media was dead wrong about these guys going to the Knicks, even though plenty of reports cited Brooklyn instead. People didn’t want to believe it. That’s not chance either, we’re actually a well run franchise."
"You forgot to mention picking up getting a league leading 3 point shooter for nothing (Joe Harris).  Question, how long does a pattern have to repeat before it's considered skill and not luck?"
Joe Harris has entered the chat.   Also the Nets just won tonight with KD scoring 26 without Harden or Irving. Seems as though there may be some people on the team who can hit these wide open shots you speak of.
our bench wont even be that bad   Joe Harris or Bruce Brown/Shamet/Jeff Green/TLC/Tyler Johnson/Nic Claxton (when healthy)/Reggie Perry/Chiozza   will probably sign a few more players to fill it out
Joe Harris
"Yes, just going into the tax. They’d also have one mid-level exception slot (e.g. mini mid-level, full mid-level).  The ability to resign other players (e.g. Joe Harris) when their contracts expire will also be an option, while continuing to go into the tax. Repeater tax penalties is where it can become a pressure cooker for ownership.  In the coming years, you’ll likely see them purchase 2nd round picks to fill out the roster for guys that can be brought in on minimum or above minimum partially guaranteed deals at the duration of their choice."
or Joe fucking Harris lol
"Sure, but that could be a problem. You guys had to put out the only star you guys have available and Joe Harris out there after they were done for the night just in case you guys blew it"
I mean all jokes aside I kind of assumed KD told somebody that be didn't come to BK to play with Joe Harris and that they needed to get something done.
"I think a lot of people will change their mind about this Nets team in 40 games. Yeah, they aren’t a perfect team, but offensively they have 3 players that can give you an efficient 30pts every night and then they have Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Shamet, TLC... This is with Spencer being out injured.        This is a team with MDA as an assistant coach, they have the potential of being one of the best offenses we have ever seen."
You didn't include Joe Harris but if probably take igoudala over him anyway.
"not even close rn , Dray was a DPOY, elite playmaker, heart nd soul of that team, Iggy one of the most complete role players ever, elite defender, elite playmaker, good 3 point shooter(playoffs), and elite ball handler, Klay can guard the other teams best wing, and also give u 20 a night, space the floor, and cut to the basket, steph is steph obv, and then u got KD, steph, kd, and klay cud all play off the ball and dray and iggy were elite playmakers, practically a perfect lineup, I dont think DJ and Joe harris are part of a death lineup for the nets IMO"
no it’s clearly Joe Harris
"You haven’t seen him play then because he’s clearly not better.  Also Caris is often staggered with those guys so he rarely shares the floor with those two.  Maybe he has Joe Harris with him, but it isn’t his fault that he played with great floor spacers.  I can say that Dipo had the luxury of playing a vast majority of his minutes next to Sabonis whose a great passing big man to run pick and roll with.  Ask any Indy fan and they’ll tell you how Victor is.  He ain’t it bro.  You’ll see in Houston."
"The guy standing at the right corner , poor joe harris"
KD is going to go off. Joe Harris needs at least 25 though.
I don’t think Brooklyn cares to guard any particular matchup. They’re trying to recreate Dantoni’s wet dream offense and just switch everything and force guys to score over the top on ISO’s.     Now AD and LeBron are perfectly content shooting over the top of Kyrie and Harden and Joe Harris on switches. Still really interested to see how well they can score.
"Wack. Well I don't think it should be too much of an issue because with KD and harden taking a ton of attention and Joe Harris being a constant threat, somebody should have a clean shot on most possessions. Celtics are the only team that have the personnel to lock up four players at a time like that imo, maybe I'm forgetting somebody but most teams are just gonna have to beat them by scoring more since they look pretty weak on defense."
"Kyrie, Harden, Joe harris, durant, Jeff green..tell me a better starting five! Bench with shamet, TLC, Jordan, Bruce brown. Its a decent bench. The lack of defense is the problema i see."
Joe Harris and Dinwiddie aren’t nothing
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
They aren't winning shit until they figure out that defense.  Who is stopping LeBron and AD?  Joe Harris and Jeff Green?  DJ is old as dirt. KD might be their best defender.
"The nets also had a better team surrounding kg and pierce at the time though. Now they’ve got their big 3 (who definitely have at least some degree of fit concerns) and then joe Harris, deandre Jordan, and terrible depth with no cap space or draft picks."
"Joe Harris is helpful, but he isn't gonna make or break any team tbh.  Rockets were tired of the James Harden show, and wanted him out."
"Yeah hardens shooters have always been sub par, ben mclemore is like the only good catch and shooter he’s ever played with, he was too much of a sieve to play much though, and chris Paul was another but his volume was very low. He’s always passed to mediocre three point shooters so it’s going to be insane to see him break down a defense and have kd/joe Harris/kyrie to hit shots"
"No, defense is the only thing Nash should be worried about with this roster and Bruce brown is miles better than shamet on defense. In terms of people that benefit from open shots, it would be Joe Harris, a great 3-point shooter unlike Shamet. There's really not much use for him outside of garbage time if he doesn't improve drastically in one of those categories ASAP."
Two many time all stars out there and Joe Harris and Jeff Green combining for over 50 and they still can't beat the worst in the league.
"Dude, you can sense the physical pain of Joe Harris. Feel a bit bad for the guy but KD pretty much screened himself lol"
"That was another bad pass by Joe Harris.  He's not a playmaker, get the ball out of his hands in these high pressure situations."
Trying to cut off any potential pass to Joe Harris for a 3 pointer on the middle to right side of the floor
Slight wtf KD but Joe Harris should not have rushed that in. They had two timeouts. Inexcusable fuck up as a team.
"Joe Harris is one fucking sniper. Wizards would love if Bertans would be something similar. Maybe they could call him something cool like ""Latvian Laser"".   **PURE OFFENSE for the basketball gods' pleasure.**      we're watching the cast team laughing and whatnot but we can't hear who is talking to them. Shit's weird."
I’ve never liked Joe Harris and this game right here has me on the verge of hating him good lord
Bro Joe Harris saved Westbrook ass lmao
KD juked the shiet out of Joe Harris 😂
"Joe Harris with 30 points, 8-13 from the 3 and 1 bad inbound pass that led to Westbrook 3.  Pain."
"Joe ""Despite the loss"" Harris."
"Joe Harris had such a good game as well, then had to ruin it with that"
"Vintage Westbrook and Beal &gt; Vintage KD, vintage Kyrie, vintage Green and prime Joe Harris"
Joe Harris and Luwalu were clutch for the Wiz.
joe harris wtf man
Joe Harris Best Player lmao
"The Nets  -  scored 146 points in regulation   - shot 58% from the floor, 53% from 3, and 82% from the line  - got a great showing from KD, Kyrie, Joe Harris and Green   AND THEY STILL LOST"
"Vintage KD, Kyrie, Joe Harris and Green vs vintage Westbrook and Beal, with an insane finish. Absurd stuff"
"The Nets  -  scored 146 points in regulation   - shot 58% from the floor, 53% from 3, and 82% from the line  - got a great showing from KD, Kyrie, Joe Harris and Green   AND THEY STILL LOST"
Joe Harris needs to spend more VC into pass accuracy
wtf Joe Harris
JOE HARRIS IS AN IDIOT
I get that Joe Harris looks like a guy that plays at the Y but stop helping off him in the corner
Joe Harris is underpaid
Don’t let Joe Harris and Uncle Jeff’s shooting distract you from the fact that Shamet is stinking it up
Joe Harris is the piece that makes this nets team scary af imo
Man joe Harris is amazing
I am a Joe Harris stan
"Nets got a big 5, Joe Harris and Uncle Jeff don’t miss."
 Wizards should consider covering **joe Harris** on 3’s
He also doesn't look too interested in trying to guard Joe Harris
Joe Harris would make a good Billy Hoyle for Westbrook.
"I have Joe Harris as the best white 3-point role player right now over Robinson and Redick. He’s going off and guarding Beal, credit."
Joe Harris really is a bootleg Klay Thompson
"Wizards defense is so bad, they are leaving joe harris wide open.   They need to get rid of beal while he still has value, this team is going nowhere fast."
Joe Harris jumper almost as beautiful as his face
Joe Harris woke up feeling like Steph Curry
Wow the wizards are terrible. Do they know joe harris is good at shooting 3's?
Kyrie/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris/Jeff Green/DeAndre Jordan is honestly kinda good in this scenario
"Y'all are some disrespectful morons lol. Man's got five All Stars, two All NBAs, an All Defense selection, three rings and is one of the best shooters in history. Joe Harris my ass, I'm sorry but you're straight up dumb if you actually believe this."
Egotistical asshole who thinks he’s way better than he is.  Put him on the wizards and he would be forgotten as a Joe Harris type
"I think they suggested A) two of Thybulle, Joe, or Maxey plus Harris and 2 first rounders or B) Danny Green, plus other expirings instead of Harris."
JJ-Joe Harris-Kyrie-KD-Harden  on the final possession when you need one basket.   Jesus
"He is a 34 year old worst version of Joe Harris and he is on a 13M contract.  We already barely play defense, JJ will just make it even worst. Unless he is bought out or something I'm not sure he'd ever come to Brooklyn."
I don’t see why we would want him tbh. Joe Harris is a better and a bigger version of JJ at this point and we already have a shooter who can’t hit his shots right now and who’s bad on defense in Shamet lmao. Plus we’d literally have to give up Dinwiddie or Harris to even match his salary.
Idk if you consider Joe Harris unathletic but he’s a very good finisher
Bro Brooklyn is 3 guys and Joe Harris. They aren’t even a complete team yet
PG and Joe Harris are cooking
Not enough people remember Joe Harris played his rookie year with Kyrie and Shump on the Cavs as well. I remember Joe Harris entering the game for Shump in scrub minutes during the 2015 finals with GSW! haha
Don't forget Joe Harris on the 2014/2015 Cavs with Kyrie and Shumpert!
Don’t make me imagine Joe Harris in that situation please
Over joe Harris? Not a chance
How much help does Joe Harris need?
"Expected 3P% is a rough projection of a player's shooting prowess based on their volume, as well as their efficiency thus far through the season. It's a way to adjust for hot and cold starts. For example, Joe Harris is shooting 48.4% so far, but in reality he's likely closer to a 40.6% three-point shooter. OP can explain it better than I can, here's a great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/l67c22/oc_what_to_make_of_early_season_hotcold_shooting/) of his on the subject.  &gt;The basic idea behind the padding method is to weigh down (or up) a player’s three-point percentage by the league average and then gradually ease up on that weight as the player increase their three-point attempts. In other words, the padding method assumes a player is more likely to be a league average shooter than not and gradually relaxes that assumption with each increasing shot attempt.    &gt;   &gt;Kelly Oubre Jr. has shot the ball so poorly and with so much volume that it’s clear he’s having a worse start to the season than anyone else from behind the three-point line. But even with his cold start, the padding method expects Oubre to shoot a not-great-but-also-not-too-terrible 32.6 percent on 3s the rest of the season. That’s also probably closer to how defenses will treat Oubre. If he really were a 21.8 percent shooter from 3, opposing teams could win games by literally paying Oubre to shoot — although they’re not far off from doing that. Less than three percent of Oubre’s three-point attempts this season have been contested (defense that is either “Tight” or “Very tight”). Only Nikola Vucevic has taken a higher percentage of uncontested looks among the top 50 players in three-point attempts."
"Also, Joe Harris would be a valuable asset to move if there is a big out there that they like. Spencer is also quite valuable.          I think if Nets don’t win it this year they will pawn a lot of their role players for the actual fit."
"Yep, the team is figuring some stuff out. Basically we've just be getting by on talent and shooting. Not great offensive sets, not great defensive effort (and certainly not good defensive personnel). But three guys who can all ISO and catch and shoot from three (coupled with Joe Harris who is elite at catch and shoot from three) is a basically unstoppable offense.   And yeah, scary hours are coming. The defense is going to get better once the Nets fill the open roster spots and get back Nic Claxton. We are playing Reggie Perry at Center. Only ten minutes a game, but as a rookie second rounder he really shouldn't be on the court for a team that is expecting to win 60 to 70% of their games. Those minutes will be replaced by a better player shortly (TBD who) and the defense and offense will get a bit better."
A lot of the guys at the top haven't played much. The only high volume ones are Paul George and Joe Harris
2014 because of joe harris
Why can’t joe Harris hit free throws.  He might be have worst FT % for someone hitting above 40% from 3
"People also bought the narrative that Harden is a ball hog and can only run an iso offense. He's an elite facilitator and having options like KD, Kyrie, and even Joe Harris from 3 make their offense top tier"
Joe Harris. People still view him only as a very good 3 point specialist. The dude is a baller and if the nets do make it to the finals / maybe even win then he will be a massive reason why.   He’s worth every bit of his contract and is one of two guys with roots to the prior nets teams that made this current roster possible.
Joe Harris in Brooklyn
Joe Harris only guarded Trae for 15% of the time according to the box score.
KD and kyrie with 65% and 64% TS respectively as well  Joe harris with 14 points on 50/48/65 and 65% TS
"Any Joe Harris nickname. Joey Buckets, lumberjack Joe when he’s got a beard, fist pump Joey.    They’re all great."
"Four of the guys on our team are shooting over 40% from three which is ridiculous, Joe Harris was shooting close to 50% at one point"
Joe Harris: 14.3 on 50/48/62
"tbf he doesn't *need* to score 35 a night on this team with teammates like KD, Kyrie and Joe Harris"
Yeah the trade doesn't look bad in terms of asset analysis I just think they could've got someone better bc Shamet was very highly valued at the time and the pick was considered valuable too. Like aaron gordon as a spot up and defensive guy who can handle a little. Or even just trading for shooter types like Doug McDermott or Joe Harris + another piece
"KD, Harden, and Joe Harris"
"You got shammets contract, Joe Harris, Deandre Jordan and somehow some picks left. Still got RHJ MKG, Rondae, Dedmon, Joakim, Roberson. Sixers got more problems slowing down the nets then vice versa"
How would that work with capspace?  They would have to give up Kyrie or Joe Harris and DJ.
"He was never snubbed... here are all the diff PGs in the NBA that made a All Star game during Conley career (2007 - present) whom were BETTER than Conley when they made the All Star team or where playing equally as well, but played in the East...  West - Nash, Tony Parker, CP3, Steph, Westbrook, Dame, Kidd, Deron Williams, Iverson  East - Kyrie, Rose, Rondo, Deron Williams, Arenas, Billups, Kidd, Joe Johnson, Iverson, Wall, Teague, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba, Dragic, Trae Young  Only these 4 guys can you even argue that MAYBE Conley was more deserving than, but again all these dudes played in the East...  Devin Harris, Mo Williams, Joe Johnson, Jrue Holiday  Sooooo, yea.. never snubbed... never really deserved it. All Star is best of the best... not best solid consistent players"
nah i think the top 3 might be the best but draymond is a much better piece than joe harris that team isn’t nearly as good without draymond
Nets big 3 is probably the most talented but I just dont see how it can work. I don’t see how they can improve their center problem without giving up one of the 3. Maybe they can trade Joe Harris?
"2021 Nets: Durant, Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris"
"&gt;	I mean Joe Harris got 72m but he can actually defend,rebound and do other stuff other than shoot.  Harris cannot defend lol"
joe Harris got 73 million for being mainly a shooter. Even kennard got 64 million
Simmons can score in the paint when he decides to shoot and if you wait until he is 5 ft away he is going to score especially when he is 7 inches taller than the guy covering him.  Do you really think Joe Harris is going to stop Ben Simmons when he decides to go to the rim?
"&gt;he won't control the ball with kyrie and harden and durant so he has to play off ball.  That's precisely what you want...  He's a great fit as an off ball passing/movement variable.  &gt;he can't shoot so his man will double one of the other guys each time  Yer applying his current form to the situation, and also joe harris has this covered fine.  The whole point is in another context, with different system, his form would improve.  Plus yer completely disregarding nash's pacing.  It's not that you have lonzo to catch and shoot, it's that you have him to play defense, board, get out and run, and make great passes, decisions, getting the ball moving early and often.    All of that shit settles between harden, kd, kyrie, and harris very, very nicely."
Joe Harris didn’t make any threes? That’s the whole team. Also Harden got more assists than Steph gets in a week
Joe Harris having a 6/2/1 stat line but being +16 shows his influence on the game. Elite gravity offensively and underrated on D.  Also - an 8 man rotation for the regular season doesn’t seem ideal when 2 of your big 3 have injury concerns.
Joe Harris is lowkey terrrrrrible defensively
R.I.P Joe Harris streak.
Joe Harris with the worlds worst block attempt right there
The only other player on that team who should be touching the ball in the 4th quarter is Joe Harris
"Dont trade Joe Harris at all, he is the perfect 4th man for the other 3."
He’s a younger Joe Harris with more potential arguably. He could def get 25 although that’s probably an overpay
"The first trade was based on the report that the Nets were interested in both of those players. I probably should’ve mentioned that in the post. I don’t think they’d move DeAndre considering he’s a friend, so I figured you’re really looking to find the expendable guy who can also make the salary work. I think Joe Harris fits the bill"
"&gt;Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M  Was certainly an overpay for Bogdanovic but the Hakws had money to spend.  &gt;Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M  Malik isn't limited as a player like Duncan is and is actually really athletic and could improve as a defender whereas Duncan's main problem on defence is that he is slow and anyone can blow by him.  Also Malik's 4th year is a TO so he got like 45/3 (and it's an ascending contract so its worth more in the subsequent years so its more in like 42/3). &gt;Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2)  Certainly an overpay for a guy who made his money as a defensive stopper but he has surprisingly lived up to his contract  &gt;Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  Again Joe Harris actually has an offensive game outside of shooting 3's and is a better defender and rebounder so I'd say he is actually worth his contract meanwhile with Duncan you need to surround him with strong defenders not to bleed points."
"So why wouldn't a different shit team in need of a shooter throw the bag at him and force Miami to make the tough decision?  Other contracts from last offseason:  * Danilo Galinari: 3 years, $61.5M * Bogdan Bogdanovic: 4 years, $72M * Malik Beasley: 4 years, $60M * Jerami Grant: 3 years, $60M (before he turned into current Jerami Grant and was averaging 12/3.5/1.2) * Joe Harris: 4 years, $75M  $20M/yr might be a little high but every offseason seems full of ""wow I wasn't expecting THAT much"" contracts. I think the Joe Harris 4 years $75M is probably about right, maybe slightly more. 4 years $80M wouldn't be a complete shock."
"That first trade is really, really bad. Javale isn't that good and Kevin is getting old and expensive. Plus neither are really positive defenders, which is Brooklyn's main problem. Spence and Joe Harris have higher trade value then that, plus Joe has been playing very well next to the big 3.  Not that huge on the second trade. One again, neither are good defenders.  There seems to be a common theme with your trade that, once again, happens here. You're trading someone for a big man but one who is bad on the defensive end. Mo Wagner is a horrible defender, which makes it even worse.  I do like that Houston trade. Boogie would be a great piece (presumably off the bench) and PJ would be great on the defensive end, something brooklyn really needs."
Joe Harris is actually a more well rounded player who is not a horrible defender.
"I mean Joe Harris got 72m but he can actually defend,rebound and do other stuff other than shoot. 15-20m for Duncan is too much."
He will get Joe Harris money and it is why I don't think he has much trade value. You are basically trading for the Bird Rights and I'm not sure there is a natural fit with another team
"Oh sorry lol. I was talking about Dinwiddie and got mixed up. Replying to a lot of people rn. Yes, Joe Harris is contributing, but I think he becomes a glorified role player on your team. Morey showed us that you can put g-leaguers around Harden and get shit done. I don’t think you need someone as talented as Harris for that role."
Joe Harris is not contributing? What have you been smoking
"The Cavs only have to get out from under Love if they want to re-sign Drummond  I do think they could eye Joe Harris as a core piece on a reasonable contract, but losing Love and McGee for him isn't a very big win  2 2nd round picks would likely be needed to sweeten"
why would we trade joe harris for mcgee and love?
"Love and McGee don't move the needle for us enough to trade Joe Harris, who is massively important to us.   McGee or Drummond might be bought out - we aren't giving up our 4th best player for the shell of Kevin Love"
Yup I'm just talking about the initiation and making the right reads. Those guys couldn't miss. The offensive plays for the Nets in the last 5 minutes were:   Jeff Green 3pt (Harden assist)  Joe Harris 3pt (Harden assist)  Harden floater  Jeff Green 3pt (Harden assist)  Harden layup  Jeff Green layup off screen from Harden  Harden 3pt  Harden 2 free throws (take foul)
Joe Harris the real MVP actually
Joe Harris is my spirit animal
we're gonna have 3 guys that are gonna compete for 50-40-90. And another guy thats gonna compete for 50-50-80 in joe harris.
"Harden would of killed for Joe Harris on those Rockets teams. He's like the perfect Harden role player (he'd be great with LeBron or Luka too). Man has like 4 seasons of 40% plus 3 PT shooting, almost at 50% this season, he shoots it at like 55% when he's open, and Harden has assisted him the most out of all his new Nets teammates. He also sets solid screens and hustles, which is just nice to watch."
Yes similar to an argument for Joe Harris over Kevin Durant
"He looked at that fourth quarter lineup of Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, and Tyler Johnson and thought, ""Huh, this feels familiar..."""
Thing is no one had that crazy of an outlier except TLC. Green has been shooting like that all season and Shamet had a rough start acclimating but is shooting 50% this month. Joe Harris had a pretty standard game.  Tyler Johnson just got into the rotation like 2 games ago and has been solid and he definitely wanted to show out vs his old squad haha.
"Everyone outside of Joe Harris on that team is a low-tier player. You give up 57 points to Meth Curry, Jeff Green, Shamet, and Cabarrot and you have to be looking at your effort.  And I would know what bad defense looks like as a Kings fan."
I wonder if the nets would trade joe harris for a healthy klay. who say no first? The warriors do need a 2nd option in joe harris to pair with curry this season to win the chip.
You forgot Joe Harris and I take that personally
"Down the stretch  * 5:33 left - James Harden enters the game, BKN 108-113 PHX * 4:37 left - Jeff Green 3, Harden assist, BKN 111-116 PHX * 3:57 left - Joe Harris 3, Harden assist, BKN 114-118 PHX * 3:07 left - James Harden floating 2, BKN 116-121 PHX * 2:21 left - Jeff Green 3, Harden assist, BKN 119-124 PHX * 1:39 left - James Harden 2, BKN 121-124 PHX * 59.2 left - Jeff Green 2 - BKN 123-124 PHX * 31.4 left - James Harden 3 - BKN 126-124 PHX * 11.3 left - James Harden 2 free throws - BKN 128-124 PHX"
"tbf, shout out to joe harris and the nets bench for keeping them in the game while harden was on the bench. hit some difficult af shots"
&gt; Classic carryjob from Harden  Joe Harris was on fire during the comeback
Sun's are so scared of Harden iso on Deandre Ayton they double him and give Jeff Green a pretty wide open layup. Joe Harris hustle closeout leads to a miss. Harden comes down and nails a 3. Nets first lead of the game. I ain't even a Nets fan but games like this are why you watch basketball.
"Fuck yeah give the ring to James Harden, KD, Kyrie, Nash, MDA, Joe Harris. These dudes are real real. Heart of a champion."
Best part of tuning into Nets games for Harden and Kyrie magic is Joe Harris casually being a fucking sniper whenever he’s given an inch. Like obviously he was always a respected shooter but he’s been downright scary.
"Yeah this sucks I was like okay fine no KD but Kyrie and Harden will still light it up, but now it's basically just put Mikal on Harden and double team him here and there while making sure Joe Harris isn't open and that should be a guaranteed W    But it's AZ sports and there is no such thing as that, but the Suns should be able to win this pretty easily"
"I know this subreddit has just become a bunch of idiots arguing about who's *overrated* and *underrated*, but good god everyone.  are there a bunch of Steph posts? probably, although I didn't check before posting this. I just figured that a guy going 3.5 weeks hitting over 50% of his threes (while taking more 3's than anyone else and defenses only real goal being to keep him from taking 3's) was noteworthy.  this is a guy hoisting up an absolute unbelievable number of shots as the only real offensive threat on his team and he's hitting those shots at an unbelievable rate.  Steph ranks #2 in shots taken this year, with an eFG% of .623. Do you know how far I have to go down the list to find someone with a higher eFG%? Joe Harris, who ranks **66th** in the league in attempts (264 attempts less than Steph)."
"Since Curry got COVID, the Sixers have gotten very little meaningful production outside Harris Ben and Embiid. Hopefully Shake can turn things around when he comes back from injury and Isaiah Joe gets minutes over Kork (not saying Joe can contribute, but I’m just tried of seeing Kork dribble into turnovers and fail to get open for threes)."
Anytime Joe Harris inbounds the ball I get war flashback dog’d
"0  He can't play the 5 obviously  He definitely ain't replacing KD, Kyrie, or Harden  and Joe Harris fits the lineup better."
"What's crZy is he doesn't assist them that much it seems like more that teams just cannot help at all off them. He has most of his assists to Joe Harris and Jeff green right now, the two other members of the nets best lineup."
Right around where Joe Harris is.
"I mean, Harden’s at 49/40/91 with the Nets so far. He could certainly make it. And KD, Kyrie, Joe Harris seem more likely than not to hit the mark."
Gotta love shooting better from 3 and the field than from the free throw line. Kyrie going ballistic and is 1/4 from the line as a 95% shooter. Joe harris has a tech. What a wacky game
Joe Harris 3   Kyrie 3   Harden floater   Kyrie middy   Kyrie 3   Harden 3   in the span of 2 minutes   lmao this team is ridiculous
"Kyrie 1/4 from the line, a joe harris technical. What a half"
"What the hell, why are Clint Capela and Joe Harris above Jerami Grant"
Three great players and Joe Harris isn't a superteam.
"I watch your games guy. You’re being biased and over valuing your own player.  If you believe a team with 3 of the top 10 scorers in the league (and 2 of the top 5 in NBA history) *need* Joe Harris to run an elite offence, i really question how much you know about the sport."
Harris spreads the floor and always requires a defender. It makes it so you can’t leave him to double the other 3. The only other option is to double off our center (Jeff or DJ). Joe adds so much to our offense and makes it so you can’t double anyone. You gotta watch the games and see how important Harris is for the offense.
Sean Marks going from the worst situation in sports to having 3 top 15 players in their prime and resigning Joe Harris and not getting this award at some point is absolutely criminal. People overrated moves related to gaining draft capital and underrate building up the foundation to acquire stars.
"No we couldn’t. They did try to keep him out of it, but there was no way for us to get another pick that the Rockets wanted without trading him. Dinwiddie is hurt so no one is giving a pick for him right now, Shamet destroyed his value with the way he played to start the season, and no one else has 1st round pick value on the team that wasn’t already included in the trade. Joe Harris also wasn’t eligible to be traded at the time"
"Disagree. Joe Harris is not essential offensively on a team that has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Kevin Durant. Your offence will be elite with or without Harris. Meanwhile you defence is turnstile regardless of who’s on the floor."
I don’t think you realize how much Joe Harris helps our offense. He’s more than just a luxury
"They should consider trading him, just not for Drummond. If a true defensive centre becomes available Harris is their last remaining asset. Kyrie/KD/Harden guaranteed you an elite offence. Joe Harris is just a luxury."
I think they look on the buyout market rather than trade for Drummond. Any trade for him involves most likely DJ and Joe Harris.
"He's a great defender tho, when he wants to be. As a Pistons fan, i can't stand him, but on the nets he's perfect. He's exactly what they need. Id throw in Joe Harris n DJ for Dre on that team. Cuz they don't need him to do anything but play defense n get rebounds. No need for his hero ball in Brooklyn."
"Drummond's making nearly 3 times as much as Deandre Jordan, the salaries aren't even anywhere close enough unless the Nets throws in one from Joe Harris/Spencer Dinwiddie.     Drummond's nowhere near good enough to warrant such a trade."
"Joe Harris, and Dinwiddie are much more valuable assets than Drummond."
"Shipped him off (along with Collins) for Adebayo, Joe Harris, and Danny Green shortly after the Allen trade. I’ve won every week since."
Would Bucks fans actually trade Brook for Joe Harris? If I’m the Nets I jump on that
"In my opinion Joe Harris is a luxury to a team like the Nets. Yes, he obviously benefits the offence but like I said above, that offence is going to be elite whether or not Harris is on the team. On the other hand you guys need defensive help desperately."
Very few centers would be more valuable for the nets than Joe Harris.
No  That being said they should be looking to package Joe Harris for a defensive minded centre. KD/Harden/Kyrie is a guaranteed elite offence. Sending Harris out for a true big man would make them a much more balanced team.
Without Joe Harris I don't believe they can get a deal done and even then why give up Harris for Drummond.
"Not to be biased but Sean Marks track record of finding diamonds in the rough isn’t bad. Of course we barely still have any of them :(  Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Caris, Jarret Allen, Mason Plumlee ish, Bruce Brown"
It’s mutually beneficial. Joe Harris had similar seasons with Dlo and Dinwiddie as his best player.
People name Ray Allen to describe the Miami super teams when joe Harris is way better than Miami Ray Allen lol  This guy has been elite the last few years.
"&gt; Players like Joe Harris are basically steroids for superstars because of their gravity.  It's vice versa.  Superstars are steroids for players like Joe because the superstars' gravity (Harden in this case primarily) gives guys like Harris open-gym quality 3 point shots, it's ridiculous."
"I’ve never ever seen a roleplayer be named to explain why someone wouldn’t deserve MVP though lol.   Like if there was a team with one star and 10 Joe Harris level roleplayers, none of those guys would normally be named to say the star isn’t a MVP candidate."
Lmao at adding Joe Harris
I don’t have to imagine. Joe Harris plays for the Nets.
Joe Harris will keep it up
Kyrie -kd - Jeff green - harden - Joe Harris is currently blowing teams out in the 4th quarter
Steve Kerr seems like a better version of Joe Harris.
"To inform people that Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan combine for 110.7 pts/game on 66% TS"
Joe Harris
Joe Harris.
Joe Harris 49% on nearly 7 attempts a game is nuts
Klay with Harden would be like Joe Harris on steroids.
How about trading Joe Harris for Kawhi Leonard while you’re at it.
"Joe Harris is really good, would be the second best bench player after Iggy. Admittedly they don’t have anyone else noteworthy  I don’t think you need ball movement, the Rockets in 2018/2019 showed that"
Joe harris was pretty underated before this season.
"A lot of its Harden being an absolute monster but a surprising reason for the high number of assists is Joe Harris. Harris has been an absolute sniper for years now even on subpar Nets teams, and I saw a tweet by a Nets beat writer that Harden has assisted Harris the most out of all Nets players.  It's crazy, I think a Harden pass to Harris running off a back screen, or a Harden-Harris pick and roll results in a made three 50% of the time."
Don’t leave joe Harris Jesus
You're better off giving up a layup than you are helping off Joe Harris behind the arc
Joe Harris money!
This Joe Harris fella is p good.
Joe Harris would have some words has well
Joe harris has the most team friendly contract in the nba
i think draymond will eat joe harris sometime in the 3rd quarter
"that's not a good help by steph, one pass away from Joe Harris in the corner"
"joe harris is the underrated x factor for the nets  if he gets cooking, it’s klay-esque and really frustrating for opponents"
Maybe they'll put draymond on bruce brown so he can help and roam a lot more.  Some combination of Oubre/Wiggins/JTA on Kyrie/harden/KD.  Steph on Joe Harris.
"Joe Ingles, Tobias Harris, Jermani Grant, Mikal Bridges and more are way better than DeAndre Hunter."
Joe Harris aka Joey buckets
Possibly yes: Brook Lopez for Joe Harris  Possibly no: Jrue Holiday for Mike Conley
"With the exception of Joe Harris, Steph Curry and Buddy Hield (reigning 3pt champ); Terry Rozier must be looking pretty likely to be invited to the 3pt shootout over the all star break. He’s a bloody flamethrower right now.  There are 4 other spots remaining, I’d assume Zach Lavine, Paul George and Damian Lillard get in but there is a hell of a lot of competition for that last spot e.g. Beasley, Mitchell, Vucevic, Bogdanovic, Middleton, Robinson, Trent Jr, Hardaway Jr etc."
No memes Joe Harris is legit one bad mofo
The Joe Harris inbound pass game is one I know for sure. I’m assuming there’s a couple others but idk for certain. Edit: Russ actually played in both wins against the Nets this year. The other one being the game where Kyrie and Durant both missed game winners. Only 2 I know.  Thank God (Leon Rose) the Knicks didn’t trade for him.
Joe Harris can play defense and cut.
I mean a good comparison is Joe Harris. Harris is shooting 49% from three and providing incredible spacing. He signed a huge contract that people said could be an overpay. He's held up his end of the bargain and been fantastic. If bertans did that her be worth it as well
Joe Harris best player on the Nets no cap
Joe Harris 🔥
You saying that you thought LeVert was a bad playmaker tells me all I need to know about whether you’ve seriously taken the time to watch him play.   Its like saying Joe Harris was a bad shooter or Jarrett Allen was a bad defender
"A simple spot up shooter is pretty soon going to be a dime a dozen. Someone who can pump fake, dribble drive, hit a midrange off the dribble or finish in the paint is going to be really valuable. Look at Joe Harris."
"Looking at you, Joe Harris"
"The Kd, Kyrie, Joe Harris and Shamet effect"
"Miami was pretty lucky to make the Finals last year. I'm not saying they didn't deserve it, but they looked like, at best, the sixth or seventh best team during the regular season. This year, they've had some problems with COVID and injuries, so Butler and Dragic, two of their three best players, have missed some games/been a bit off, and in general the team just isn't playing their best. Performance in sports is variable -- sometimes players just play better or worse, and sometimes there are clear reasons we know about, sometimes there are reasons we don't, and sometimes there just aren't clear reasons at all.  Kyrie has never been an MVP candidate. Then their other players are pretty close to replacement level and their defense is hot garbage. The rest of the roster is aggressively mediocre besides like, Joe Harris, and the team construction is not ideal. They also are probably getting moderately unlucky with opposing shooting, their defensive issues aside, and with a lot of new personnel it's not like Nash -- a rookie head coach! -- is going to be able to implement a solid defensive system overnight.  Better teams lose to worse teams all the time. Take like, Celtics-Pistons and Lakers-Grizzlies tomorrow, where 538 has the Celtics as a 9.5-point favorite and the Lakers as a 10-point favorite. They only give the Celtics and Lakers an 83% chance to win -- or, a 17% chance to lose. That's about one-in-six, which should happen routinely -- it'd be substantially more unlikely for there NOT to be an upset every night. I'm not saying that this season is or isn't more variable than usual, but that's not really the kind of thing that we can understand anecdotally."
The next 4 behind him are:   Lillard - 95 (counting this game)   Hield - 94   Joe Harris - 89   Lavine - 85
"Shooters that can drive when closed out on, Joe Harris, KCP, Seth Curry, Kuzma, McDermott, Huerter, Bogdanovic etc. its really not impossible or too much to ask a guy to develop his game over the years so he can take advantage of an open driving lane. Like I said they just need to be average at it not D Wade level."
Yeah I know it’s not possible for everyone. It’s just you can tell some guys don’t even try. There should be more Joe Harris type guys that try to attack aggressive close outs but you can’t know if your driving has improved if you always pick up the ball right away.
Not sure what you mean by undersize because he’s 6’5. He’s been great for us whenever he gets minutes. His game is more similar to Joe Harris than Duncan Robinson which is great!
Reminds me of Joe Harris
"Ahh yeah I agree with that, but I also think this creates an even playing field because those other guys won’t get paid less if they are worth it.  Like the third/four string guys that are making big money will still be offered that money just at different teams.   As with a guy like Joe Harris he might only be able to make a couple of mill with the Nets but I’m sure a team like the Knicks would now have a chance at a guy like that without having to offer a stupid over the top amount.  I would have the cap worked out so if you want 3 max contracts you would basically have to fill the rest of the roster with minimum contracts."
"Let me put it this way, if the Kings have 40m in hardcap space between Fox and Barnes’ salaries, do they save money by skimping on pay Fox his max? No the Kings will pay that either way - they aren’t going to *not* pay their franchise player, and even if they did another team gladly would.  Barnes would just get offered 12m instead (the rest) of 20m.  Teams would just skimp on mid-tier priced role players than not pay stars imo.  I don’t think Joe Harris gets 18m for example, I think the Nets would rather sacrifice him than Kevin Durant."
Joe Harris JJ duo is a PROBLEM   For both teams on the court
What’s the point of Redick on the nets when they have Joe Harris?
"That's a nice lineup and I understand why they did it that way, but Seth Curry and Joe Harris deserved a spot."
"Lol Hield, 40 year old dirk, seth curry, danny green and joe harris   &gt;all stars"
And Joe Harris
"That is clearly way weaker. Average fans don’t give a shit about Danny green, Seth curry, buddy hield and Joe Harris"
"Um 2019?  Steph, Dame, Kemba, Hield, Middleton, Dirk. And then Seth Curry, Danny Green, and the Champion Joe Harris.   The 3 point contest is consistently star studded nowadays this is absolutely no different from the usual."
"Where’s Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris, Bertans at?"
joe Harris?
He’s no joe Harris
Joe “Steph “Logo “Ice Trae” Lillard” Curry” Harris
If joe harris tested the market he’d be an Hawk or Hornet
He might see the offer. I'd be a little surprised if he got more than Joe Harris though. At least I'd disagree with the valuations.
I know I have watched it a few times. Joe Harris has one job :)
"He’s the reason why.   Bruce brown, joe Harris ,kyrie of course when he’s played, have all been good but harden is the life of this team"
"He has but with just kyrie and not much else on the roster outside of joe Harris harden would still have just a good supporting cast , not amazing or anything"
Joe Harris making those easy shots that’s how you know he super good
"Should be Curry, Joe Harris, Freddy, GTJ, Brynn Forbes, Bertans and MPJ"
Nets depth is better than that team’s depth by far. Joe Harris would’ve been the 4th best player by a mile on those teams.
"I still think the pick made sense from a value perspective (the Miami pick was viewed as a very valuable asset at the time) and Zhaire Smith was seen as an extremely high upside defender with good shot instincts. SGA was viewed as an equally raw player at the time, and Bridges was seen as a low ceiling/middle floor type player who was on the older side (obviously he’s taken some spectacular leaps)  I’d say the last few years we’ve actually been pretty effective in drafting to fill out the roster.   The last 3 drafts have gotten us:  - Shake Milton who is our primary bench scorer  - Landry Shamet who played a lot before being a key piece in the Harris trade  - Matisse Thybulle who is our primary bench defender who very well could slot into the starters role next year  - Tyrese Maxey who is our high upside combo guard who should help lead the bench and eventually push for a starting role  - Isaiah Joe who will be the bench shooter replacing Korkmaz next year and has defended a bit better than expected in limited run  - Paul Reed who is absolutely obliterating the GLeague and should be our bench big next season.    I’d say we’ve actually done a pretty good job hitting on contributors with upside relative to their draft position."
"KD: Giannis, draft Joe Harris.  He can give you some shooting tips."
He’s had Kyrie for most of them. And so many role players going off like joe Harris.   He’s only been in Brooklyn for 20 games. He’ll move higher if his play  continues but he’ll never win with a super team.
I don’t think you’re wrong. Johnson and shamet are just decent player. But if you compare them to like a Wesley Matthew it’s not that different. Johnson in particular has been consistently solid.   Besides we have 7 players that are gonna see mins in the playoffs who have been solid all year. Big 3 - joe Harris - Jeff green - dj - tlc.  Tlc and dj are obviously weaker players but they’ve shown they can at least 10-15 against top teams   The rest of the guys will play 30+. We also have Bruce brown who has been fantastic for us.   We are deeper than we seem right now
You could tell me Joe Harris was shooting 65% from 3 this year and I'd believe you
"C'mon, you could have come up with a better insult than that given the material you had to work with. And win or lose my point was the Pack Line defense has players constantly moving to the ball and to keep players out of the paint, whereas the mover-blocker offense has shooters constantly looking for openings and others settings screens. It may not always work but it most definitely requires effort to implement both physically and in learning the principles.   Look at a guy like Joe Harris. He's not the most athletic guy out there but he's always moving on the court partly due to the what he learned at UVA. You can shit on us for UMBC, think we're boring, etc, but the players put in the effort for the most part every game. All that said, this season does leave me wanting a little more effort from the current group of guys."
"Outside of KD, none of these guys play remotely the same. And comparing joe Harris to draymond green is beyond laughable. They legitimately have opposite skill sets."
&gt;Draymond Green = Joe Harris  and it got worse from there
Idk But joe Harris has been money
Did Joe Harris nut tap him
Last year there were 28 players over 40% from 3 with George Hill at 46% at #1. So far this year there are 53. 8 players are shooting better than 46%. Joe Harris is at 50.5%. Jeremy Lamb and Bobby Portis are at 50%.
If you told me Joe Harris was shooting over 60% from 3 this season I wouldn't even question you
I want a Joe Harris on my team.
"It’s hard to say who is underrated on the Nets because there’s such a spotlight on the team. A year ago I would have said Joe Harris, but now people are watching him he’s probably properly rated. Bruce Brown just had that monster game.  I guess I’d probably say TLC as his defense has been pretty good, but gets overshadowed by the poor team defense this team has.  Overrated was probably Dinwiddie when he was healthy. Great box score if you just box score watched, but consistently had so many wasteful possessions"
N E V E R trade Joe Harris please
Joe Harris is my god
Joe Harris makes me think Kevin Love v2
Why do we help off of shooters.  Bruce Brown is the clear liability shooting wise and yet we play off of Joe Harris for some reason.  So stupid.
"He’s not that great of a pull up shooter, but IIRC he’s second only to Joe Harris since he came into the league on catch and shoot threes. He’s got one of the purest shooting forms in the league"
Christ Harden wasn't lacking for shooters during the peak Houston years but has he ever had someone as accurate as Joe Harris
"Yes.  But it's ok to pay Jarrett Allen.  So the Rockets got a pick, off loaded Prince's deal.  But if Allen signs a 4 year, 75M deal, is he still worth 1 pick?    vs If Prince signed a 4 year, 75M deal, he is a negative asset then.  &amp;#x200B;  Like Joe Harris before this season was making 30M/3, he is now at 75M/4 year.  Is he not someone others would try to acquire even though his salary almost doubled?"
"This guy has been on Durant’s level for a while now Imo. People love to diminish Harden but he is very much on the same level of KD as a GOAT tier scorer but his playmaking is vastly superior.   Now surrounded by actual *elite shooters* that shoot with volume, there is literally no way to slow down his offense. At least with the Rockets, you would hope the law of averages would help since they didn’t have a bevy of lethal shooters. Cant hope for the same with him flanked by KD, Kyrie and Joe Harris along with shooters off the bench."
"Well for one KD&amp;Kyrie &gt; Jimmy&amp;Bam so you’re more willing to risk it all if you’re the nets. I’m also pretty high on dinwiddie so I think between him and Joe Harris the rest of the teams fine, DJ has also stepped up"
"A few vet minimums could really help them. Aside from trading for Drummond which to me seems obvious, why not try Boogie Cousins for a bit. He won't cost anything. In the offseason they could have tried for Jae Crowder who would have been a great addition. You don't need stars, just some solid role players (eg. Joe Harris). John Collins clearly wants out of Atlanta, so how about taking him on."
"Caris gonna come back and average at least 18+ too.  The baby Nets are all incredible role players/borderline stars.  Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, Caris, Joe Harris, D' Lo are all good building blocks."
"Sorry, I took issue with your argument that he's been a better point guard than Curry since joining the Nets because Harden has the more competent offensive team and thus has more spacing, which allows for more open driving lanes and opportunities for kickouts to shooters like Joe Harris/Irving. I know Harden has always been a better playmaker than Curry but I wouldn't take total assists as the only barometer in determining the best point guards. Harden has the best Assist/Potential Assist percentage at 59% - the second leading percentage is around 52%. He is afforded more assists by virtue of having some of the best 3-pt specialists."
"How this even a question? Almost all take PG. Only ones that don't, are just ones you need strictly 3 and D like basically Joe Harris type"
"Belive it or not, there is a slight difference in passing to Joe harris, irving, KD, and throwing lobs to DJ and passing to Finney-smith, Josh richardson, james johnson and throwing lobs to WCS lma"
"Harden is passing to Joe 50% 3-pt shooter Harris and Kyrie Irving - who are Luka, Trae, and Steph passing to? Luka is passing to Tim Hardaway/Jalen Brunson, Trae is passing to John Collins/Capela, and Steph is passing to Oubre/Wiggins - all substantially worse than Joe Harris and Kyrie Irving, which thus makes it harder to create assists."
"People focus so much on the Big 3 and seem to forget about Joe Harris (averaging 70% TS), Bruce Brown (one of the best wing defenders in the league, also putting up a 60%+ TS) and Jeff Green ( 64% TS, one of the most versatile and switchable bigs)."
I thought it was Joe Harris
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
"Mostly hype.  The greatest hype celebrations belong to Joe Harris btw, you should look out for them when he’s playing."
"I know his contract sucks, but Wiggins is still definitely better than Joe Harris. Not going to even get started on the Curry/Kyrie situation.  Also, if you were going by contribution it would more likely be:  Curry - Kyrie  Draymond - Harden  Klay - Harris  Wiggins - KD  Embiid - whoever"
He's no Joe Harris that's for sure.
Ok let’s say Kyrie gets shut down. Then they have to deal with Harden and KD while trying to run Joe Harris off the 3 point line. That’s most likely not going to happen.
Because he's the only playmaker. Shut him down only KD is left to make points. Joe Harris isn't making shit if there's no one to set up plays for him
"How does one shut him down in this situation though?? He has KD, Kyrie and Joe Harris next to him 😆before he really had to worry about him scoring. Now you double him and your asking to be lit up even worse than before. A few teams tried doubling on him and the ball found its way to the open man almost 99%of the time"
"The lottery ended up being pretty booty, but aside from all stars in Embiid (3), Randle (7), LaVine (13), and Jokic (41), the draft also had numerous starters or major role players: Aaron Gordon (4), Marcus Smart (6), Elfrid Payton (10), TJ Warren (14), Nurkic (16), Garry Harris (19), Capella (25), Bogdan^2 (27), Kyle Anderson (30), Joe Harris (33), Dinwiddie (38), Jerami Grant (39!), Dwight Powell (45), Clarkson (46!), and the legendary Thanasis Antetokounmpo (51)."
"Steph is the best shooter ever no question about it but I think most people know the reason Harden’s % isn’t higher is that bc for years he’s taken very high difficulty 3’s. Look at his % with the Nets now that he’s playing with other elite scorers and a knockdown shooter in Joe Harris, Harden’s 3p % is over 40% now."
"And yet I don't see defenses doubling or trapping Joe Harris the second he touches the ball, so either NBA players are stupid or you are?"
"Then why does someone like Joe Harris get celebrated by RAPTOR? I feel like his 3 and D role is similar to Klay. Super high, low volume efficiency on offense with passable defense."
"If we go by that stat, Jakob Poeltl, Clint Capela, Joe Harris all deserves an all star selection. It's a bit of an overrated stat imo"
Morris is shooting 5 attempts per game. Joe Harris - the biggest all star snub this year - is still the three point god at 50+% on 7 attempts per game.  Fun Fact: If Morris missed his next 27 three point attempts he would still be shooting better than 40%. great season by him
"In terms of production, Joe Harris is the best 3 point shooter in the NBA. No one in the NBA is more efficient at making 3-point shots than him"
"definitely some PTSD. Trust me, nothing is sweeter than looking at our current roster and record then doing the same with the Celtics. There's one player on our team that we actually drafted, the rest have come through free agency and trades. Basically got Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, and TLC for free, picked up Jeff Green and Tyler Johnson for next to nothing, traded a G leagues and a second rounder for Bruce Brown, then of course signed Kyrie KD and Jordan and traded for Harden. Only semi-questionable move was trading a mid first for Shamet but he has turned it around lately and that's technically part of the Bruce Brown trade so it was a net positive.  Celtics on the other hand have had a million draft picks over the last 6 years and are under 500"
"LMAO it absolutely does. Steph Curry is the best shooter of all time, not Joe Harris"
Joe Harris and KCP
"Harden is better then Steph lmao, he just never had help. Joe Harris is basically klay with average defense, the nets are better with pg"
"There’s  some crazy shooting spilts this season. Joe Harris, Zach Lavine, PG. Joel and jokic are like 4-5 percent  away on free throws from a 50-40-90 seasons as bigs lol"
"Paul George, Galloway, Bertans, Lavine, Joe Harris are a few that come to mind"
Joe Harris #1 3 pt shooter in the league
Joe Harris
"Yeah even peak Warriors had to play a bunch of non-shooters / below average shooters around the big 3. Nets currently have 7 guys shooting over 38% from 3. Even if some guys fall down to earth, having an elite shooter like Joe Harris really opens up the offense. This offense might just be on a level we've never seen before if everyone is healthy."
"I mean you would need context to go along with it, otherwise Joe Harris is the best shooter in the NBA. Making 35% of contested 3s is better than 35% of wide open 3s, right?"
Joe Harris disrespect will not be tolerated
"Honestly is it outrageous to say if you need a 3 pointer in the clutch on the nets team, you give it to... Joe harris?"
Definitely. Joe Harris is shooting lights out and teams are giving him wide open shots because of Kyrie and Harden being on the floor. It's nasty. They're going to run a closing lineup of KD-Harden-Kyrie-Joe Harris-and then who cares. Good luck guarding that
And Joe Harris
Having Joe Harris on this team is just OP
"Force Harden to score. I know that sounds dumb for the scoring champion of the last few years, but it's a better gameplan than letting Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris get in a rhythm with scoring. I don't think any team has a chance when the ball is flying around and everyone is super hyped and full of energy. It's just human nature if you're getting involved on offense to play harder D and move around on offense, and when that happens it becomes all but impossible to stop that wave of momentum.   These guys are NBA players. If you're in the NBA, you can get hot and put up 30 if the opposing defense doesn't want to match your energy or really get in and guard you."
"Him and Jeff Green have become everything a team could ever want in role players. Between those two and Joe Harris we have some fire power for the playoffs. Once claxton gets his feeet under him too oh baby   I’m still not sure how we got him for what we did but hey, I’m not complaining."
"Real big 3 is Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Jeff Green"
best starting forward combo in the league in 6'6 Joe Harris and 6'4 Bruce Brown
Joe Harris and who
I’m starting to think we should trade KD Harden and Kyrie for depth and just roll with Bruce Brown and Joe Harris.
and Joe Harris’ while they are at it. Joe being below 80 is fucking criminal
"Id go Capela over Warren. Warren had a decent run for a bit last year and that’s it. I’d go Aaron Gordon, Jerami Grant, Jordan Clarkson and would debate Joe &amp; Gary Harris over Warren too from that draft class."
Joe Harris &gt; everyone no cap
Guard Joe Harris 1 on 1???
There’s basically nobody for lebron to guard on the nets is the issue. He’s avoided guarding Durant and harden in the past. He can’t chase around joe Harris. He’s not guarding kyrie. I’d guess they put him on Jeff green and Davis on Durant. But that pulls all the rim protection away.
I think you have to have guys that can guard Joe Harris and Kyrie 1 on 1.  Switch off between doubling/blitzing KD and Harden and make the 5th guy beat you
Lakers just need to make sure they don’t make joe Harris look like a star also lol. He had so many open shots that one game. If they do meet in the finals I wonder what Defensive game plan vogel is gonna come up with.
Joe Harris was basically out of the league at one point. He was cut from like 2 teams in a week and was thinking about playing in Europe until he got a shot with the nets. Imagine going from thinking your dream of playing in the nba was over to being a starter on a contending super team as one of the best shooters in the league
"No Joe Harris is not a star lol, but dude is a stud. Best (non injured) shooter in the league not named Curry."
"I've shared these 2 tidbits about Joe Harris before, but I'll share again.  Joe Harris takes the subway (or at least used to) from his place in Brooklyn to Barclays.  Now for a 7 o'clock game he was prob on the subway around 3 to 4 to get to Barclays so it wasn't rush hour, but imagine being 6'5"" and not being recognized.  Joe Harris lives with his mother (after she got sick).  Imagine signing the 2 big deals he has with the Nets, and living with your mom.  Here is one I just remembered recently but it was talked about out of camp this year.  Joe Harris got a tattoo.  [Link](https://twitter.com/billyreinhardt/status/1336053515236610051) It's of his mother and grand mother."
Joe Harris is the best teammate Harden's ever played with besides KD and Kyrie
So I can’t pick joe harris? pass
"Dude's article that he linked argues that Harris should get All-Star consideration because he's having a better shooting season than Korver.   &gt; Player A: 12 ppg, 4 rpg, 48% FG/49% 3pt/6.0 3PA  &gt;  &gt; Player B:  15 ppg, 3.5rpg, 52%FG/50%3pt/6.7 3PA &gt;  &gt; Player A? Kyle Korver during the 2014-15 season. Player B? Joe Harris this season. This was a career-best season for Korver, who is known as one of the best shooters of the last decade. Harris is scoring more this season with higher efficiency, despite taking a higher volume of shots. Kyle Korver was an All-Star that season, while Harris’ name hasn’t even been in the discussion for All-Star this year  The better comparison is to Korver's stats when he was named as an All-Star, not at the end of the season."
Now Joe Harris is the best corner 3 man in the game lol
the issue is the pnr. Hardeen is gonna take whoever is the weakest defender and put him in the pnr to get simmons off him then go one on one. if they trap then kyrie plays the release valve role to attack 4 on 3 and with durant/harris spacing its just difficult to guard.  Simmons did a great job against harden in our last matchup but we didnt have that secondary ball handler to help release the ball pressure on him. Philly definitely has defenders to compete but right now idk if theres any defensive coverage that can really slow down this trio + joe harris but we will certainly find out in the playoffs.
Joe Harris is one of the most underrated players in the league imo
if joe harris gets to be an all star I will straight up cume my pants
"It's mostly development. Most of the guys on your list come out of college  a dime a dozen.  There are so many 6'6 3 point shooters in college right now, but Joe Harris could fit any system and there was no way to know that.  There are so many ultra-athletic 6'8 guys in college that you don't know their true position - Jerami Grant developed the skill to go with the athleticism.  Jordan Clarkson - a non-flashy, mistake-free PG in college became a non-flashy, mistake-free combo guard in the NBA who could get a super hot hand. But it also took him a while to land in a situation where his talents were the best fit.  Jokic - he's just a unicorn. No one saw that coming and no one could have."
And his 3 is Joe Harris. His role players are just so much better.
"Jordan and Blake are straight up not very good now, why are they being lumped in with Kyrie and Harden when Joe Harris is objectively better at this point"
Joe Harris wears Lucious Harris 12
Nets developed joe Harris tho  Cavs gave up on him quick. I remember when he was on the Cavs wondering why he wasn’t playing more. Didn’t expect him to become a 50% (or even 40%) shooter from 3 but still. He showed signs that one year on the Cavs
Bruce Brown or Joe Harris
Cavs also had Joe Harris at one point.  They both sucked for them lol
"It does happen. However the reason for such frustration from randle down to the fans is the inconsistency of that call, along with the multiple times kyrie tripped over himself yet gets a foul. Joe Harris air balls and it’s given back to the nets. The refs were absolute shit and inconsistent. The Knicks offense was also garbage for most of the game and they put themselves in that position."
What about the calls when Kyire “tripped”. If it was one call whatever but the calls were against us all 4th quarter. And this play wouldn’t have even happen if they didn’t mess up the joe Harris steal call which would’ve gave the Knicks more time to shoot their final shoot
They need Blake and joe Harris in there too
"Well KD has barely played since Harden got there. Honestly the shooting percentages for the Nets seems unsustainable. Jeff Green has played with a lot of good teams is a career 44% shooter from the field and 33% from three. This years he’s shooting 51% from the field and 43% from three.   Kyrie, a career 47% shooter from the field, is shooting 52% from the field. Joe Harris, and career 44% shooter from three, is shooting 50% from three.   These are mostly games where they’ve only had two superstars, not three. I think the Nets are the clear favorites. But I’m curious if some of this performance is related to having no fans in the stadiums. Shooting overall is on a historic pace."
"How are they going to stop KD, Kyrie, Harden, and even Joe Harris? Guys have been putting up insane numbers against the Nets all year and they’ve been fine. Embiid/Giannis can go for 35 and 20 every game and I still like the Nets chances"
"I think people are just frustrated that the system feels so shitty.   i think its completely reasonable for the player to want the ref to watch that game deciding play in slow mo, especially after they fucked up the call preceeding it and spent 10 minutes overturning it.  i mean, franky fouled out off of kyrie stepping on his foot and falling 2 minutes before that on a completely blown call.    I think call being correct or not doesn't matter so much.  The frustration is because of the system in place and who it serves.  This felt just like a really shitty way to end a game... watching RJ not foul Joe Harris in slow mo for 10 minutes and then Scott Foster deciding game over just feels wrong.  the VAR system in soccer is shitty and loathed but it feels way better than what the NBA has."
Why pick on Joe Harris?  The exact same thing happened with James Harden a few moments before and no one criticized him.  It was a trap play and the Knicks did a good job getting hands on the ball for the jump.  Joe Harris didn't fuck up.
"its more about personnel for Brooklyn imo, elite perimeter guys will hunt the Kyrie and Joe Harris matchup in the playoffs. And given how easily they give up the switch that's going to be a problem they're going to have to deal with"
Joe Harris is a beast
"he's like the most reliable open three in the NBA. if Danny Green shot like Joe Harris, his entire career would be different and people think of him as a good shooter. lol Joe Harris is a positionally sound defender, doesn't make dumb mistakes, and he finishes really well. if you uploaded Joe Harris's brain into Lonnie Walker's body, he'd be a full blown star, easily. lol I think Joe is as good a player as his talent level allows him to be.   I think guys often get called overrated if they aren't pushing their ceilings. that's why Tatum catches a lot of shit. theoretically his ceiling as a two way shot creator is about as high as it gets, so if he's ""only"" scoring on above average efficiency, people think he's overrated."
"Joe Harris is on easy street atm and is getting the same type of praise that a star would get based on his TS%. He is simply a good roleplayer in the best possible situation, getting the best looks and only needing to do one thing. He's been a little disappointing from the line too but we'll call it small sample size because drawing fouls is not the one thing he has to do."
"""Hey, I could call this a foul and give Joe Harris two free throws, and be done fixing this game, and nobody would say a thing about it, but I'm gonna call it a jump ball. I'm pretty sure there will be a razor thin judgement call on the final shot, and that's where I'll screw over the Knicks."" -Scott Foster, moments before rigging the game for Brooklyn."
"Just as I suspected, Joe Harris is part of the Big 3"
"Agreed, but that's how it goes. If Danny Green could shoot as reliably as Joe Harris, he wouldn't be Icy/Hot, and he'd be a much more valuable player. If PG was a game to game reliable scorer, hed move into the superstar tier, depending on what your definition is.  as it stands I think he's like the top guy in the highest level ""star"" tier."
"Can't forget the mysterious ""block/deflection"" on Joe Harris' air ball"
"Harden just elevates his teammates better. Jeff Green, Joe Harris, DJ, literally everyone gets a boost from his playmaking."
"What a complete fucking shitshow of an ending. What the fuck was that? What's with Joe Harris and choking in these late game inbounds situations?   Also, did I miss news or something, why is Bruce Brown like not playing anymore? He didn't get many minutes the last two games and then barely played in this one."
"Joe Harris getting all the help from his super team and the refs, smh"
Joe Harris
"Joe Harris- Love shooters  Devin Booker- Again, love shooters  Jokic- I like flashy passes and trippy jumpshots that go in"
At any given point in time there’s a possibility that Joe Harris is somewhere splashing a 3
that’s the Joe Harris way
"And they have one of the best 3 consecutive jersey number lineups. 11 Kyrie, 12 Joe Harris, and Harden 13"
Joe fucking Harris!!
I feel like teams should stop sagging 12 feet off Joe Harris.  Strong side weak side idc
"Harden, Durant, Joe Harris and who else?"
joe harris shooting 50 percent from 3 on high volume is definitely crazy
"Except he hasn’t been playing with KD lol   And is the Nets without KD even better than the Bucks? I don’t think so. Jrue + Middle &gt; Kyrie and Joe Harris, defensively and offensively."
Consistency is a mystery. I’m more puzzle on some known good 3pt shooter with bad ft%. IE: Joe Harris 49% 3PT vs 69% FT this year.
Like wtf Draymond Lowry Derozan doing there bro you coulda pick Kyrie Dame Luka Embiid and fucking Lebron you chose those guys  And you picked Klay while picking Harris. Klay thomspon basically Joe Harris but way better at everything(shooting defending playmaking finishing size)
Joe Harris  Do I even need to explain why?
You can have anyone you want and Joe Harris and Draymond are on your team....
"How? KD, Kyrie and Harden are the obvious three, who would be their 4th player? Joe Harris is shooting 68% from the FT line and he also takes like 1 ft/game"
I mean it would skyrocket if he had Joe Harris in those playoffs.....
Joe harris is shooting 50% from 3 on 7 attempts per game... He's obviously not as good as Klay but you're proving my point with that comment. The sheer fire power of the nets allows him to get way better looks than klay would. Deandre jordan is a way bigger lob threat than draymond which is all the nets need him to be. Also idk why you're being such an asshole. I came in here to comment and talk basketball but was called names by other people including you.  Stephen A Smith even mentioned that Kyrie should be on the MVP list.
the nets need to spend less time getting joe harris open and more time letting kyrie go to work
Smokin Joe Harris
Joe Harris needs to double his 3 point attempts.
What if a guy like Joe Harris attempted 20 3's a game? Would the team's scoring efficiency go up or down?
"Joe harris has been absolutely devastating. It seems as he never misses a shot.. and you cant defend it well with Irving ,Harden,Durant."
"you're right man my fault. guess joe harris &gt; klay thompson and deandre jordan &gt; draymond green eh? don't forget about hall of famer nick claxton and bruce brown. not even the 96 bulls could beat them! don't forget KD's telepathic powers, being able to contribute to this hot streak right now while even on the bench in a hoodie!"
"What does shooting have to do with dribbling up the court?  Joe Harris and Klay Thompson don't get doubled dribbling up the court either. James Harden does though, and more often than Dame does. Does that mean Harden is a better shooter than everyone else?"
"The thing that made GSW so special was the defensive end supplementing that insane offense. I think its fair to say the Nets have potential for a better offense, but that Warriors team was so impressive on both sides of the ball.  The Nets definitely seem like a video game roster. Just nutty. This Nets team in 2K must be treated like Michael Vick in Madden 2004 in terms of them being banned among friendly matches, unless both teams are rocking the same team.  DeAndre and Joe Harris are so good in 2K as well."
"Gordon Hayward, Joe Harris and Kevin Love"
"Arguably the best playmaker in the NBA right now - passing to Kyrie, Durant and Joe Harris   Team might be better than 2016 Warriors when they mesh"
Hardens doing it with kyrie and joe Harris. Your best player played with them once upon a time and didn’t lead the league in assists so why would you?
Not only kyrie but DJ and joe harris. Floor is very well spaced and they have shooters.
"They're already outgunning most teams and KD adds defense and offense.  Pretty insane squad.   Joe Harris, Harden, Kyrie, and DeAndre Jordan should be giving up 120 every night but somehow they aren't.  We just have to accept that they might be pretty decent defensively."
"Other than Kyrie and Joe Harris, the rest of the Nets roster isn't that great. Harden has been elevating their play. Your point about playing on better terms elevating stats is true, it's just that it's more true for Harden's teammates than Harden himself. And that is the crux of my argument for his MVP talk."
I know your joking but Joe Harris is better than both.
"How is the APG not impressive? He doesn’t even assist kyrie often and didn’t asisst KD much either in all the 6 games they played together. He gets his assists from jordan/brown/green/harris, and joe Harris 3p% is boosted by the looks harden gives him. The guys harden gets assists to are worse or the same as other elite point guards, thats nonsense.   Everyone calls Deandre washed AF and claxton is a literal g leaguer. This is nonsense"
The Lakers roster without AD and Schroeder is easily worse than the Nets with Kyrie and Joe Harris. That's what LeBron had when he went on a losing streak.
Harden with irving/joe harris on the wings to pass to after he breaks down the defense is literally better then anything he’s ever had. His efficiency is going to be elite this playoffs
"I'm not sure I agree with Lakers were the deepest team in the league at all. Even if they were, Kyrie is so much better than Schroeder (the next best player on the Lakers) that it's not even comparable. And how many Lakers would you take over Joe Harris?   &amp;nbsp;   Either way, all NBA coverage I've heard of the Nets has been 1. holy shit Harden has been incredible and 2. he absolutely has zero shot at MVP because of how he handled himself in Houston. Idk where you're hearing he gets zero credit."
"Think of it this way, do you think teams would still think the wall works if Joe Harris and Klay were on the wings?  if they don't help on Giannis he is dominating 99% of his match ups. if they wall of then Klay/Joe are shooting 40%+ on 3's. I never understand how people who apparently watch basketball can't even understand shit like this."
Can we see what Lebron would look like next to Joe Harris and Kyrie? I think it would look pretty special tbh.
"People have picked up on Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown is getting recognition too.  Claxton will get buzz soon but some people are still sleeping on him. Deandre has been pretty good lately too for all the shit people (me included) have said about him."
Still Joe Harris
"Lol do y’all really think putting giannis on joe Harris is the key the slow down the nets. They got like 4 40% 3 point shooters but hey giannis is hounding the paint  I saw the same exact argument from fans as to why giannis didn’t guard butler then they got fucked. When the lakers played the heat in the finals in the last game they put AD on jimmy and that was it series over  The nets have 3 elite scorers, 1 elite spot up shooter, and filler but giannis can’t guard kyrie or harden at all so if he doesn’t clamp up Durant that would be a fast series"
"No stars are available right now. I’d imagine the Embiid Simmons pairing will be allowed to prove themselves this season, and if they fall short again, there will be heavy rumours but they’ll get one last shot before trading one of the two. Other than that they have pretty limited assets to trade. Maxey is an option, but he’s average just under 8 PPG and 2 APG, he’s going to be a good player, but not remotely enough to bring in a real scoring threat. Trading Harris is an option, but he’s in the second year of his 5 year $180 million contract. He’s still tradeable, but he’s a 20 PPG shot creator, he’s probably their best option now. I can’t see them trading for a better option. He’s not on a great contract, but he’s done well this year, and there’s no upgrade that they can get at the moment.  They have some other assets, but if they want to compete, they should hold onto them. Thybulle is a good asset, but wouldn’t you want to hold onto an elite wing defender who’s an alright enough 3 point shooter? They’ve got lesser assets like Ferguson, Paul Reed and Isaiah Joe, but they haven’t proven to be more than subpar rotation pieces, and they’re just not going to net you great players. If a superstar becomes available and they can make an offer of Harris, Maxey, Ferguson and picks, then by all means do it. But at the moment, I can’t see any trade options for them."
"Bro Anthony Davis &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kyrie. Giannis has Middleton and Jrue. Kawhi has PG. I don’t think Harden should win, but he’s in the discussion. Especially once KD is back it’s over. But harden has only played like 5 games with both Kyrie and KD. Also Joe Harris? Yes that’s what happens when you let one of the best guys ever at making mediocre 3P shooters look good get an actual sniper."
Solid box out by Joe Harris. LOL
The dude really is very talented.   Shame it didn’t work here we need all the help we can get.   Between guys like him and Joe Harris we’re pretty good at drafting guys later that are actually decent just not for us lol
"Smart has some dirty plays in him for sure, but he's not an out and out asshole like Bev can be, Bev feels like he actually sometimes is out to hurt somebody vs Smart who just goes too ham sometimes. I've never seen Smart intentionally try to hurt another player, and it's telling that he and Joe Harris (the guy fouled on this play) are good friends."
"I assume Donte on Kyrie, Jrue on Harden, Khris on KD, Brook playing drop coverage and anchoring the paint cos DJ isn't a threat from deep and Giannis basically playing the free safety role that he does well. Otherwise Khris on Joe Harris if he's starting and Giannis on KD."
"No doubt. But dude, even joe harris is better than anyone on our team outside of lebron and AD. Yes, better than schroder, harrell, kuzma."
Joe Harris is still miles better than anyone on the 2011 miami bench
Smart was pretty good offensively.  Defensively tho he left joe Harris and shamet multiple times to help and got burned. I think it’s a tough dilemma for guys like smart who instinctively want to help but you just can’t leave the nets shooters open that’s why our offense is so deadly it’s not just the big 3
"""do u even watch basketball"" in reference to literally one quarter in a game he played 13 minutes all postseason 18 years ago, ignoring that Steve Kerr made a grand total of one other three the entire rest of the postseason as some sort of statement about ""CHANGING DA SERIEZ""  LOL, all in defense of your inane point that teams would be shaking in their boots to come see 40 year old Korver trot out there for 5 minutes a game and stand on the 3 point point line and play some sort of homeless man's Joe Harris role.  The fact that you think washed up Steve Kerr and washed up Kyle Korver coming in to not guard anybody and shoot some wide open catch and shoot threes is ""pretty lethal"" suggests to me that you don't watch, or perhaps just don't understand basketball outside ""SHOOTING GOOD"""
It’s pretty clear his leg injury was blocking his eyesight and he couldn’t see Joe Harris there.
"I love watching the nets man. Harden's passing, kyrie's finesse, Joe Harris shooting lights out and players like Bruce Brown, Claxton and shamet randomly popping off. It's such a fun team. They make their opponents play to their style and hence the games are usually high tempo."
Korver on the nets would actually be pretty lethal  Imagine being relieved seeing Joe Harris leave the floor only for Kyle Korver to replace him
"I don't think this is fair to Joe Harris. He's shooting his best percentages, but he's been improving every year and balled out the last two. Give him his respect."
"**TEAM PACERS (with a twist)**  Billionaire Bruce Wayne sells his corporation and buys an expansion team, complete with an alternate timeline version of the Indiana Pacers.  Current teammates Paul George and Kawhi Leonard prove that -- while social media may hate them right now -- they can fit like a glove on virtually any roster in the league. They provide some excellent perimeter defense that, coupled with Myles Turner, leads these new Pacers to one of the best defensive ratings in the league (finishing # 2 overall.)  Offensively, the team can get caught up in some ""iso ball"" at times, but they manage to get bailed out by Kawhi Leonard's ability to win in those situations. The Pacers end the league year with the # 1 seed out East. The question from here is: will they step up when it counts? Or will PG+Kawhi fold once again?  Round 1 is easy, with the team sweeping the Knicks. In round 2, Boston doesn't provide much more resistance, with another 4-1 win for the Pacers.  The Eastern Conference Finals appear to be more of a challenge, as KD, James Harden, and Kyrie arrive in town ready to test that top-tier defense. Kawhi and Paul George gamely step up their games, but James Harden manages to create some foul trouble for them that limits their minutes. The Nets go up 2-1. Game 4 is even worse, as Kawhi Leonard runs cold and Paul George goes 3-13.  Now down 3-1, it appears as though these Pacers may be folding. However, they do have some aces in the hole: PG Malcolm Brogdon has emerged behind the scenes as a key leader for them, encouraging them to stiffen up and fight their way back into the series. Brogdon even steps up his share of the offense, bullying smaller Kyrie Irving and going for 19-7-8 in a Game 5 win. Kawhi and PG find their rhythm again in Game 6, leading to another win! The team has officially tied it up, 3-3!  Going into a pivotal game 7, everyone looks tight. The offense is slow -- stagnant at times -- and perhaps relying too much on one-on-one play. T.J. Warren tries to do a little too much of that, coughing up 3 turnovers in a game where he should probably be in a background role. In turn, the Nets get hot beyond the arc with Joe Harris hitting 4-7 threes. The Nets end up pulling away and winning this one 115-107.   Afterwards, the Pacers are disappointed, and wonder how much could have changed if they had the full effect of homecourt advantage. Alas, COVID had other plans in mind this particular season."
"**TEAM KEVIN**  Owner Kevin Hart has made enough movies and enough money to buy an expansive franchise, which he's named after himself.   The roster looks stacked, with 5 players who are multiple-time All-Stars across the board. There's a distinct Minnesota flavor to the frontcourt as well, as KG and Kevin Love played for the T-Wolves and McHale coached them. The chemistry appears to be off the charts during training camp, with the Kevins feeling like a title may in the cards.  As the season starts, that chemistry carries over -- especially on the offensive end. The Kevins start to defer to Kevin Durant as a matchup nightmare. Opponents can't guard him with smaller wings, because they'll be abused on switches against the big men on the roster. The Kevins score nearly at will, with KD leading the way with 28 points per game on sparkling efficiency.  Defensively, the team is more up and down. Kevin McHale huffs and puffs trying to keep up with modern wings, leading to some upset losses here and there. When Paul George goes for 41 points against the team, they start to re-think their strategy. More and more, they let KG come out on the perimeter and guard some fluid wings.  Ultimately the team heads into the playoffs with the # 2 seed in the Western Conference, and a good shot of winning the title. In round 1, they bully ball their way to 4-1 series win over Dallas. In round 2, they manage to pull off a slugfest 4-2 win over Utah.  In the Western Conference Finals, they match up with the L.A. Lakers and LeBron James, proving to be their toughest test to date. However, prime Kevin Garnett proves to be a good defender for the older version of LeBron, and his constant barking appears to be bothering the King. Kevin McHale's physical play also bothers the Lakers and Anthony Davis, who chirp often to the refs about dirty play. Ultimately, the Lakers don't have an answer for KD's offense. Durant scores 37 points in a decisive Game 6, leading the Kevins to the FINALS.  In those Finals... they match up with ANOTHER Kevin Durant and the Brooklyn Nets. The Nets prove to be a difficult matchup for our Kevins, who don't have a good answer for James Harden. Harden lights them up for 41 points in a game 1 victory. The Kevins pivot to a more ""ground and pound"" game, utilizing McHale's post game to help power them to wins in Game 2 and Game 3.   The series continues to go back and forth, with the Nets unleashing a 3 point barrage after that. Joe Harris gets loose for 5 threes in Game 4 (won by Brooklyn), and Kyrie Irving catches fire and goes for 33 in a Game 5 win.   Now down 3-2, the Kevins need to lick their wounds and get back on track. Again, they pound it inside with McHale and Kevin Love, slowing the game down, dominating on the glass, and pulling out the win.  It all comes down to this... Game 7. The Brooklyn Nets and Mike D'Antoni need to switch up their strategy -- and rely on Kevin Durant. They switch constantly, pulling KD off KD and giving him some mismatches. Team Kevin doesn't have much of an answer for Brooklyn-KD, who hits quite a few long bombs against McHale and Love. Brooklyn-KD goes for 35 points in a Brooklyn win. Our Kevins go home, upset, and intent on adding a little more perimeter defense next time around."
"If we’re using the same logic being used against Embiid, then it’s Joe Harris.   “The best ability is availability.”"
"Kd hasn't played in a month. Blake hasn't put on a nets jersey. Joe Harris is a role player. So basically he just has kyrie and role players...no different than Bron having AD and role players, yet one is being penalized for having too much help."
"Blake Griffin hasn’t even played with the Nets yet, and he’s extremely washed.  Joe Harris is a solid role player. He’s not a superstar or a star so there’s no point bringing him up.  He’s hardly played alongside KD as well. While I don’t think Harden is the frontrunner, you can’t argue that he doesn’t belong in the conversation."
He’s played 6 games with KD and 0 with Blake (who isnt good by the way). Joe Harris is a good player but should never be a needle mover in an MVP race.  Meanwhile the Sixers also have Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris (and Seth Curry since apparently those guys matter too) who people conveniently leave out in these conversations

"&gt;	No, no it doesn’t.  Yes it does, which models are you comparing it to?  &gt;	Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if Conley’s defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the model error makes the model itself worthless.  None of that is average, and that’s on you for not understanding the context   &gt;	This also doesn’t explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher.  Not hard to understand if you don’t realize that the combination on all the injuries and having Enes Kanter as his center makes Lillard’s defense look even worse this year. Again, context"
"He Has kd,kyrie,Blake griffin and joe Harris as teammates cmon now y’all"
"&gt; Not really, RAPTOR has a lot fewer outliers compared to most models   No, no it doesn't.   &gt; Conley has not been average for his career at all that’s a pretty casual take. Conley has always been an all-defensive caliber guard and it’s obvious that his high D-RAPTOR is heavily influenced by sharing the court with gobert a lot. You have to look at context.   The model itself was saying Conley was average, ffs. Stop calling people casual because you can't read.  Conley had an average of +1,2 DRAP his last two Grizzlies seasons and now is at 5,0. The model is supposed to evaluate players individually, so if  Conley's defensive value is increased by 300-400% by playing with Rudy Gobert, then the error model makes the model worthless.   &gt; Rudy and Poetl both play low minutes and mainly play against bench squads.   Poetl has played almost 800 minutes, roughly 200 minutes less than the minutes leader of SAS, and Rudy has played 600. They are the first two guys of the bench. If you are saying the model can't evaluate bench player then that is a different argument. This also doesn't explain Lillard being 35 in raptor behind guys like Montrezz Harrel, Joe Harris and Chris Boucher."
He did dribble though. Bounce was behind Joe Harris.
"Nets with a Literal Big 3 of Andre Drummond, Blake Griffin, and PJ Tucker. Maybe even DeMarcus Cousins.     On top of the original Big 3 of Durant, Harden and Kyrie. And that's doing the glue guy Joe Harris dirty."
Kevin Durant   James Harden   Kyrie Irving   Blake Griffin   PJ Tucker   LaMarcus Aldridge   Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins   DeAndre Jordan   Joe Harris   Jeff Green   Landry Shamet   Bruce Brown   Iman Shumpert   Nicolas Claxton   Tyler Johnson
"Harden on this nets team will easily match lebrons offensive production, lebron will be the better defender though. KD would be far better then Wade, and would also produce as much as bron, atleast scoring wise. Bosh is a good fit but kyrie has been insane and they also have joe Harris"
And joe harris
"for those wondering, joe harris made 3/10 3s tonight"
This is the reason we got stars but if you look at this team and the clippers/Lakers you can see how much more loaded we are asset wise because of marks. We had a bunch of good players on cheap deals for trades like levert Allen and dinwiddie and consistently found diamonds in the rough like joe Harris. We also were able to build a playoff teams and open up two max slots. Clippers were a playoff team but they had to give away a lot to get kawhi and pg. nets were able to retain most of their players because marks got them on cheap deals and off the scrap heap.   We eventually traded them off for harden but again that deals not possible without developing them.   Also no team in league history has rebuilt that quickly without draft picks and with no assets. It was a miracle rebuild job that absolutely deserves credit.
WHAAAATT you mean Juan Toscano Anderson ISNT as good as Robert Covington or Joe Harris
Blake was in a sweater on the bench Put some respect on Joe Harris name OP!
Kyrie Morris and JT were all good friends. Kyrie didn't get along with Rozier and Brown from what was apparent. Ofc you can't know for sure  Also I think the guys just didn't fit together as a team. Everyone had to sacrifice and noone was lifted up. Look at Brooklyn and see how Bruce brown Jeff green and Joe Harris benefit from the stars. They play better than they would without them. With the Boston team they were all so good that they're all putting up great numbers this year but did not fit together at all. If Hayward was healthy a lot of those issues wouldn't have mattered because we would not lose as much and the fit would be better with an additional playmaker but he was recovering.
"Clearly if you factor in attempts, joe harris is the best 3 point shooter in the league."
"that is crazy. he's good  another interesting stat: 5 of the top 25 seasons, as measured by TS%, are happening this year  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_season.html  1st. Joe Ingles  12th. Ivica Zubac  22nd: Richaun Holmes  23rd: Jarret Allen  25th: Joe Harris"
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist **Harrison Barnes** (Sacramento Kings); **Jaylen Brown** (Boston Celtics); **Joe Harris** (Brooklyn Nets); **Brook Lopez** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks); **Donovan Mitchell** (Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist **Mason Plumlee** (Denver Nuggets), **Marcus Smart** (Boston Celtics); **Jayson Tatum** (Boston Celtics); **Myles Turner** (Indiana Pacers); **Kemba Walker** (Boston Celtics); and **Derrick White** (San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
Lol.  Someone hasn't watched Joe Harris
"He’s substantially overrated. Shooters become much better when they’re open, and Joe Harris is always open."
Rank	Player	3P% 1.	Steve Kerr	.4540 2.	Hubert Davis	.4409 3.	Seth Curry	.4407 4.	Dražen Petrović*	.4374 5.	Joe Harris	.4372
hahaha joe harris sucks the nets should totally trade him hahahah ^please...
He is Imo.  In no order Curry Nash Dirk Joe Harris Ray Alen
Flashbacks to that one dude who said Joe Harris was better than Trae Young
"No, he's just a complete nothing player. Joe Harris makes zero difference for that team in terms of championship potential.  Is Seth Curry underrated? Is KCP underrated? Is Luke Kennard underrated? Those are the comparisons for someone like Joe Harris."
I think Harden Point Kyrie SG Joe Harris SF KD PF and Jeff would get the job done with a nice scoring punch off the bench and nik Clayton playin those crunchtime minutes because of his defensive abilities
"I agree, there's a reason a big man hasn't won an MVP for over a decade and the one who could win it this season plays way more like a guard than any other big ever.   I think general priority for high draft picks should be elite offensive engines e.g. Lebron, Steph, Jokic &gt; versatile wings e.g. Klay, PG13 &gt; versatile big men e.g. Draymond, Bam, Sabonis &gt; Specialists/role players e.g. Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen.  Obviously, not many players enter the NBA as rookies at near all-star levels like Luka, but to barely be playable even with low minutes against bad teams as a 2nd overall pick is unacceptable in my opinion.  Wiseman has a shot at maybe being a versatile big man with a few seasons of development, but it's nothing concrete and taking him 2nd overall feels like a mistake to me especially as we could've traded down and maybe gotten ourselves a decent player in the off-season."
"you guys got rid of literally everyone that was part of this turnaround other than Joe Harris, so why not let one more go?"
"&gt;Joe Harris, LMA, Blake Griffin a superteam.  The Nets have a Big 3 that's it, don't try to make it sound like they have anything more than 3 All NBA caliber players. These guys are role players, Joe Harris will see minutes in the Playoffs, but one of LMA &amp; Blake will not."
"No one considers just harden and Kyrie a superteam....we consider Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, LMA, Blake Griffin a superteam."
Offense still going thru Blake and LMA  KD will back up Joe Harris
"I mean it comes down to the players. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Lamarcus Aldridge is a stronger lineup than any 5 the Lakers can put out there."
id rather build a team &amp; add 1 or 2 final pieces in free agency/trade than literally swap out the entire team except dinwiddie and joe harris obviously you’re supposed to upgrade but its gonna be hilarious when that upgrade was ultimately for nothing
"Nets with Blake, DJ, and Joe Harris seems like they would still do well"
The absolute disrespect to Joe Harris
I need Jazz-Nets in the Finals. Joe Harris vs Joe Ingles
Joe Harris
Was AK-47 a role player? Or Joe Harris? Pippen with 14 Joe Harris' would be fun. Harden with 14 AK-47s or OG Anunobys.
1 LeBron 14 Joe Harris.
"The secret people have yet to realize is it’s Harden. It’s always Harden. He’s an automatic playoff birth in the west regardless of what’s around him. He rarely misses games. He’s both an all-time scorer and playmaker, one of the most elite floor generals we’ve seen.   Kyrie is a monster. He’s been going off. Same with Joe Harris. Same with basically everyone on the team. But they’re all playing easy mode because of Harden."
"&gt;Never has three top ten efficiency guys plus one of the most efficient guys in shooting history in Joe harris have all been on one team  Two of those three see large efficiency drops in the playoffs, so it remains to be seen how that efficiency holds up.  In a small sample so far, Harris has been terrible in the playoffs.  Maybe they will turn their histories around.  They will need to.  &gt;But the nets although not as good overall, are a better 3-pt defense than the bucks.   Does not matter if Antetokounmpo is dunking on them constantly.  Or others.  &gt;  (because super teams didn’t form like this scenario in the past)   The method of player acquisition is different, but the Nets are not unprecedented.  Worth noting also, that the Nets are barely beating bad teams right now.  Houston and Minnesota gave them all they wanted.  Yes, without Durant, but we're talking about the two worst teams in the league and neither were at full-strength.  That would be enormously concerning to me, if I were a Brooklynite."
"Well I understand where you’re coming from but it’s a special scenario. Never has three top ten efficiency guys plus one of the most efficient guys in shooting history in Joe harris have all been on one team. But the nets although not as good overall, are a better 3-pt defense than the bucks. The bucks winning wouldn’t be historically insane, but the nets winning with this talent regardless of past (because super teams didn’t form like this scenario in the past) wouldn’t be crazy for them to win"
"What’s funny about that is he wasn’t even good 2 years ago. He’s a lot better on the Bucks, all he has to do is catch and shoot.   Joe Harris is the only guy I’d take over the Bucks guys. They provide more on defense than what they give up on offense, except BP. I just like that maniac"
Just looking through the 2nd round in 2014 and there was several great players taken there. Makes you wonder wtf teams were thinking taking PJ Hairston over Jordan Clarkson joe Harris nikola Jokic etc
"I strongly disagree with point 2. It's gonna look bad when you compare players 4-7 with any other contender's stars. Like think about Joe Harris, Claxton, Blake, and LMA vs Middleton, Holiday, and Giannis or Kuzma, KCP, and Harrel vs Kawhi and PG.   I honestly think Portis, Pat, Donte, Brook is quite comparable or even better than other contenders 4-7."
"Their bench was not better than what the starters were last year lmao. That’s a joke. We saw LMA on a mediocre team just this season, he was a negative for them, they were better when he didn’t play lol. Allen is significant better than a washed LMA and a developing claxton. I like claxton but imagine if Allen got to play with Harden, would’ve looked even better than claxton does now. Kyrie played 34 games don’t know what you’re smoking. Joe Harris was also a starter on that nets team last year and this hypothetical is discussing the current nets bench. It would be a bottom 3 team in the league no question."
"&gt;He isn't shooting efficiently from all over the floor - his eFG% is like 51st in the league, he is efficient at the line and that brings up his TS%.  Ok fine, I will admit from looking at his shooting splits there's a chance he's below average from 3-10 feet. Other than that though he's good at the rim, probably slightly above average from 10-16 feet, maybe one of the best season ever from 16 ft to 3, and very good from 3. His eFG is 51st out of 125 which given his volume is good.  &gt;Elite scorers are guys that have both high eFG% AND TS%. Making FT's does not make someone an elite scorer.  I don't get this argument. If a hypothetical player scored 50 PPG just from free throws I would say they are elite at scoring. Scoring means scoring points, and free throws get you points. If you want to see who the elite scorers in this league are, look at the league leaders in PPG. If you look at guys with high eFG% and TS% then again you think the elite scorers in the league are Joe Ingles, Joe Harris, and Richaun Holmes. Being able to shoot matters of course, but being able to score is more important when we're talking about scoring."
"A little too early to tell since they barley played any games together but I think the nets are probably the better option. KD seems close to his old self, Harden and Curry are close, but Kyrie is a way better offensive option than Klay. Not to mention Joe Harris is a lethal 3 point shooter while Draymond is weak offensively and it’s not like the nets are missing out on playmaking with Harden there.  It’s an interesting question though, because defense does help offense which the KD warriors were far better in. If you’re not getting as many rebounds&amp;stops by default, you’re going to have less offensive possessions. You can flip that on its head tho, it’s pretty impressive how the nets typically take less shots than other teams yet have been winning on a consistent basis"
Might as well give it to Joe Harris.
"They're not superstars. That's like saying Gary Payton on the 2006 Heat was a superstar. That's like saying Tracy Mcgrady on the 2013/14 Spurs was a superstar.  IF the nets go far in the playoffs (a big IF considering the Heat and Bucks are on par and them+76ers+possibly the celtics are all definitely better if KD is not 100%) then LMA and Blake will be far down the list of players who contribute the most to their success.  Here, I'll order it:  Tier 1: Harden, KD  Tier 2: Kyrie  Tier 3: Joe Harris, Jeff green, Deandre Jordan, Bruce Brown  Tier 4: Landry Shamet, Luwawu-Cabarrot, Nic Claxton, LMA, Blake  That means Blake and LMA will be somewhere between the 8th and 12th most valuable contributors in the postseason when that level of player usually gets 8 minutes a game.  Really? Have their not been enough changes to benefit small market teams?  Apparently it's impossible for small market teams to win. Only big market teams like the... San Antonio Spurs can win a title or 5.  You know, if a front office focuses on player development, asset management, coaching and infrastructure rather than whining to the league when the nets or lakers sign a guy to play 14 minutes per game in the postseason, (god forbid giving up a 2029 2nd rounder to take Drummond away from the Lakers buyout option) then they too could succeed rather than infringing on freedom of player movement.  Honestly, the small market crocodile tears are pathetic."
"They have a strong correlation, but they're not the same thing. Take a look at the [league leaders in TS%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_advanced.html#advanced_stats::ts_pct) as an example. Do you think that Joe Ingles, Ivica Zubac, Richaun Holmes, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris are elite scorers? No, they're good in a more limited role. If they needed to shoot as much as someone like Embiid their efficiency would likely crater. Being an elite scorer requires being efficient at a high volume. So yes, they're related, but they're not the same thing."
It was Joe Harris all along
"If they do, they're nuts.  They're a bottom 10 team in terms of talent in the league and that's taking into account that they literally have one of the 10-15 greatest players of ALL-TIME on their team.  The rest of their roster SUCKS, specifically on offense and Klay alone isn't enough to change that.   Klay on a championship team is at best a 3rd option, maybe even 4th when you consider how loaded a team like the Nets are, that's what Joe Harris is after all.   And on this Warriors team next year he's expected to be the 2nd option.   I don't think enough people realize that if you time travel the 2015 and 2016 iterations of the Warriors into the present, they don't win the championship and they probably don't come out of the West, and not for the reason that everybody thinks, their defense would still be awesome, but they don't have enough shooting on their team, which is nuts considering they have 2 of the greatest shooters ever, but the rest of their team isn't good enough on offense when you look at how offense has gotten so much better in the last 5 years."
"Born and raised in NYC and know for a fact that if this was happening to the knicks we would see NYers out in full force. It truly is knicks city. The amount of knicks fan gear walking around would be off the charts. Knicks fans are desperate for true relevancy outside of just saying ""hey we are in NY!"". They are already excited for this current team, imagine if they were legit contenders.     That being said, I have been a diehard nets fan for over 20 years and I mentioned in another thread that it's hard for me to get truly excited watching this super team win. Am I happy to see that they are 1st in the east? For sure and want to celebrate if they win it all but it's tempered.     I mainly excited and happy for Joe Harris. Too bad Dinwiddie can't be out there but there's really no one else on the roster I have a fan connect with."
"Jumpers aren’t exactly going to bring down your true shooting percentage. Many top guards shooting percentages are in the 60s, and these numbers are driven by jumpers. I mean nailing 40% of your threes is like shooting 60% on twos. That’s why players like Joe Harris are leading the league in true shooting percentage. Steph in 2016 as well. Don’t get me wrong tho, at the rim buckets are the best shot in basketball."
joe harris I think
Doubling off Joe Fucking Harris on the strong side like come on Charlotte.
"They tried to trade him for awhile. There were no takers.  People were calling him washed up and honestly overall he's no longer a 1 or 2 option. Yeah Harden and KD weren't out there, but Kyrie is still a bonafide star and Joe Harris is an elite shooter, that helps big time. It's also Charlotte, not exactly a powerhouse team on either side of the ball. Role players like Shamet also did well. You can get this type of performance short term and look good in that situation.  Aldridge is fine as a role player. He just wasn't fine as a franchise guy. He's 35, outside of LeBron there is no 35+ year old franchise cornerstone in the league. Honestly LMA looks ready to retire if he can win a ring this year."
How can you leave Joe mfkn Harris that open 😭
"Imagine when we have Harden, KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris out there... damn y’all this might be fucked yo"
damn it is weird seeing Joe Harris next to all those names
I think any time all three are on the floor you're going to have to pick your poison and hope Joe Harris doesn't get in rhythm.
"The turnaround Mark's has done is phenomenal. He built a great base and culture with the shittiest hand. Finding and developing Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Levert, Jarrett Allen, and now Claxton. Plus bringing bad contracts in or facilitating trades for picks. They had no right being a playoff team so quickly after the failed KG trade. Then it helped KD and Kyrie wanted to team up and chose a good location that had the room. Rest is history and good luck"
"Idk if it's kendrick fucking perkins, you don't double a role player sharing the court with Kyrie, Joe Harris, and Jeff Green. Seriously it's never worth doubling a role player with much better teammates on the court unless he's the Michael Jordan of turning the ball over."
Yeah maybe Joe Harris isn’t the guy we leave. Just a thought. I hear he’s shot some basketballs in his lifetime.
"Doubling with the defender responsible for Joe Harris is, uh, not the greatest NBA defensive idea I've seen."
"The whole issue people had was that LA wouldn’t draw doubles off of BKN’s shooters, so he felt like a redundant fit with his lack of defensive versatility. This is just bad scheme by CHA. Dont fucking leave Joe Harris"
"I don’t think this is evidence he’s not washed, it’s just evidence that the defense is terrible lmao let’s leave Joe Harris wide open"
"Easily, harden kyrie joe Harris and LMA can take anyone in the east"
"You’re telling me guys would be down to play 2 weeks after the deaths of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Spencer Dinwiddie, Bruce Brown, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Claxton, Alize Johnson, Bruce Brown, Chiozza, and Perry? You’re out of your goddamn mind.  And I used the Nets because they have the most stars, but the same is applicable with every team. You don’t have a mass casualty event like that and just keep playing like nothing happened. I know money talks but no league is that insensitive."
Yeah leaving Joe Harris unguarded at the 3pt line seems... counterproductive
His post skills are such a weapon for this team! He still demands respect in that area of the court and it’s going to make for a lot more of these open shots. Joe Harris is going to thrive next to him.
"Great recognition, move, and pass by LMA, but I think the defense fell apart because of Biyombo. I get Biyombo wants to help and needs to keep an eye on the lane. However, he needs to commit to either doubling Aldridge (sensible because of the LMA on Hayward mismatch) or staying in drop coverage but with an eye on Jeff Green, but he gets caught in no man's land: he's not between LMA and the basket and he's really only kind of denying a passing lane to Kyrie. #25 does a good job picking up the cutter and denying the easy basket there. You can also see Rozier (#3) takes over guarding Kyrie, and he tells Biyombo that Jeff Green is now Biyombo's responsibility. #4 (Graham?) is kind of covering two people at once for a moment there but his man is Joe Harris in the corner, especially considering Harris is the more dangerous shooter. I think it's safe to say Rozier assumed Biyombo would close out on Jeff Green, but Biyombo kind of just stood there like a statue. Rozier wasn't great here either (hips completely turned in the wrong direction of the shooters on the floor), but Biyombo could have tightened up the lane better.  Also, people saying Griffin and LMA are washed are kind of right, but mostly wrong. Their athleticism is sapped by age, but the effect of high BBIQ and making the right play is multiplicative on offensive power. It only takes one weak guy on offense for the defense to find something to exploit (like Roberson or Tony Allen being left alone at the arc or with some players' inability to dribble without losing the ball), but when all five guys can pass, shoot, dribble, and make smart plays, the offense can go nuts. It's like how in baseball, if you just play a bunch of dudes who don't get out easily, that just magnifies the strengths of the lineup. Of course, their defense could be questionable, but we'll see if they turn it up in the playoffs because they have little incentive to go super hard (or even play, in some instances) during the regular season."
"That's what you think.   When uncle Jeff gets one, it's actually also Joe Harris.  4 threes."
"He just got his fourth three. God, aren't you watching? Number 20 on the nets, legend Joe Harris."
"Idk man, Joe Harris and Claxton are pretty fuckin good"
Calling Joe Harris useless is a bit insulting tbh.
tacko fall and joe harris
I wouldn’t be surprised whatsoever if Joe Harris is the best open shooter in the NBA period. He’s not Curry because he can’t do what Curry does with the ball or his release being as quick.
"Joe harris &gt;&gt; than Steph! We beat his highschool team in the WA state tourney his junior year, crazy to look back on that he definitely wasn't the reason they lost"
"&gt; Klay's playoff average 3PA and efficiency is about the same as the best single year PG ever had.  Yeah, one of them plays with Steph Curry and gets much easier looks as a result.   Joe Harris has a much higher 3pt% than Curry this year, does that mean he's a better shooter? Or is it maybe that his teammates draw more defensive attention than Curry's do?"
"Nah I'm good dont worry. I live in a poor city. You can probably figure out which one by looking at my profile. I rent a 2 bedroom house for under 500/month. Thats what I meant by life changing. I dont make a ton of money, but for my city I do ok and its very very low COL. Ive always made really good money on 1st score, going back... 8ish years now. $800 on Dawson Knox in the afccg on $40, $600 on gronk in the sb, hit on Isaiah Mckenzie on the Bills twice when his odds were above +4000 last season. And those are only a few, I could name about a dozen more just from last NFL season alone. Im... phenomenal at figuring out game plans and that may sound snotty but oh well, it true. 1st score, the odds are so high i only ever have to spend $20-40. Ive only been at it for NBA like 3 weeks, If you check my post history, even before that hit, I posted a miss i had, got 2/3 specifically saying I'm getting closer and closer every night...thats only one night where I got 2/3. I got 2/3 Four nights in a row until FINALLY hitting (getting impatient on +55000 odds. That it took a whole 3 weeks). I got 2/3 again last night, kristaps and Jerami Grant were my 2 guys. I should've just thrown 10 on just those 2, but I tossed them on tickets with Brook Lopez, Morris on LA, Joe Harris etc. Got greedy.  4k is practically life changing in now I have some breathing room. I can make these bets for the next 30 days in a row, not hit a single thing and not worry (spend $20-40 a night). That ain't gonna happen. But its just 4k is by far the largest amount I've ever won and now I can try and take another step up with these bets. Instead of winning 2200 on $4, im gonna be able to put $6 on it, make it a 4k win. Once I hit another one, I'll be able to do $10. And so on. Slowly but smartly. I appreciate the concern but im good. If I can keep doing what I've been doing I can actually start looking at buying a house"
There is unfortunately no switch to be flipped for the Nets their entire roster is full of low IQ defenders. KD consistently makes bad reads from the help side. Harden barely ever has any idea what’s going on on defense and Kyrie has never put any effort on the defensive end. It’s hard to win a championship when your best defender is Joe Harris.
"I am a fan of the NBA and I just thought damn what a good season by Joe Harris, good for him. Maybe I should get checked out or something."
he was shooting like 50% from 3 his last year with us and didn't make the 3 point contest and shot like 30% after that. he's historically been a guy who's flamethrower hot or just kind of bad. that contract is rough next to a guy like Joe Harris who's both more consistent and a better defender.
watch the game my guy. they left him wide open for both threes and rockets pretty much gave up the last two possessions by leaving Joe Harris wide open.
As I said previously. I was arguing with someone else and going back and forth over a team dispute. I thought said person replied to me in here by mistake which is why I said “this is about joe Harris”
"i stand by it tbh, i think this Nets team should be able to beat any team even without KD. This roster is that stacked. Joe Harris is consistently open, Kyrie is getting a lot of space too."
&gt;You literally responded to a whole different post lmaoo this is about joe Harris
Kyrie and Joe Harris are greater shooting threats than anyone Blake ever had in Detroit.
"I mean saying Joe harris is the 1st option is wrong but I wouldn't wanna be an ""internet karen"" by correcting you when you're wrong."
Imagine being Joe Harris and the 4th best player on a team with KD Harden and Kai
"Green plays the SF because Curry is the SG. Same with Joe Harris, he plays SF while Irving plays SG."
"I mean, he’s got higher usage too, which explains the extra attempts.  I’d be curious to look at their per 36 comparisons.  Joe isn’t even a starter.  Not saying it’s not impressive, just definitely a cherry-picked stat.  Tony Snell is shooting 57% from three but only averaging 2.5 attempts a game.  So why didn’t they say 1+ attempt a game or 2 or 3 or 5?  And if the extra attempts are the more impressive part why aren’t they mentioning Steph who average 40.9% on 11.5 attempts per game?  The stat was specifically picked to exclude people who are shooting just as impressively or more impressively than Joe Harris just this season, so I wouldn’t call it “the best 3pt shooting season in NBA history.”"
You literally responded to a whole different post lmaoo this is about joe Harris
"Ive been seeing all those posts on facebook/twitter catered to the casuals showing pics of Nets ""all star"" line up when its been clear from the start that Joe Harris is their 4th guy"
"And pull Joe harris and Spencer Dinwiddie out of midair   And use late 1st round picks on Allen and Levert  And trade Musa and a 2nd for Bruce Brown   And use a 2nd round pick on Claxton  Like put some respect where it's due, Nets FO has been much better than the Celtics over the past 5 years"
If Joe Harris got fouled more often then...
"Joe is the 4th best player, but arguably the first option. A Joe Harris 3 is the most efficient shot on the team"
"Yeah, because Joe Harris is insane"
Joe Harris is the 4th option
claxton came here cause of Joe Harris too.
I’ve been a Joe Harris stan for awhile. I think he’s the most important player on this team outside of the big 3. He has a tendency to play a little too passive though. He needs to play with that same aggressive energy that he played with today.
add Joe Harris.
"KD, Kyrie and Harden all came to Brooklyn to play with superstar magnet, Joe Harris."
"Imagine if the Nets do not win the title this year with Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc (assuming they're all playing). It would be an absolute embarrassment.   I'm honestly rooting for them to choke to see the backlash."
"On the backs of Joe Harris and Nick Claxton, just as everyone expected"
This game proves that Joe Harris is the most important piece outside of the big 3.. unreal game from Joey Buckets
"Because KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris is offensively stronger then Dwade/Bron/Bosh, and Bosh was never super great in the playoffs, Offensively, the Nets rival the KD Warriors, obviously defense is incomparable  And besides, the heat lost in the finals against a mavs team that swept Kobe (the defending champion) and beat the KD big 3 Thunder and LMA blazers  The Nets have the potential to lose before the finals to the bucks or sixers, it does not help that Kyrie and KD have a injury history and both were out for a significant portion of the last 2, almost 3 years"
"no remorse, but as a Cavs fan, watching a game with Kyrie, Joe Harris and KPJ gives mixed emotions"
"I was actually encouraged by BK grabbing Blake and LMA, bc maybe Nash is dumb enough to have them play sizable minutes and make them easier to defend.   If not, then yea the real killer is Joe Harris. You can’t cheat or double off the big 3 so when that 4th guy is an all time great shooter that’s brutal. The only reason I still go with Denver is 1) Jokic can exploit their only weakness which is defense at the 5, 2) I just have a gut feeling the lack of chemistry will bite BK in the ass"
"Be honest, would you be able to recognize Joe Harris on the street?  He looks like a guy from the Bachloer"
"Lakers look like Bron 3's and layups, and AD midrange  Brooklyn looks like Kyrie and Harden step backs and floaters with Joe Harris in the corner  Utah looks incredibly efficient. Like a team playing great modern basketball.  Clippers looked flawed without anything at the rim  Portland looks like Dame Time  San Antonio looks like the 2000's  GSW looks like Chef Curry  You can really see the teams play styles and what players they have."
Brooklyn having their big three and then being able to kick it to two of the greatest shooters in league history in JJ and Joe Harris is frightening.
"Harden, CP3, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and PJ Tucker.   Pretty damn decent"
Yeah this ten seed whose most valuable young piece would net someone on a Joe Harris level should go all in.
"The 2013-14 UVA basketball team that swept the ACC was surprisingly stacked despite zero 5* kids. Malcolm Brogdon, Joe Harris, Anthony Gill (plus future 1st round pick Justin Anderson off the bench).  Happy that Gill is finally getting his shot. Wish that Brooks would play him more, dude's such a hard worker"
I hope this is a Jynx because Boggy has literally been better than Curry and Dame in my points league last few games and its the fantasy Finals   My “two best PGs in the league” have fallen off a cliff and dude like Boggy and Joe Harris are the real Steph and Dame
Joe Harris hitting them 3’s is some sight
"F Joe Harris &amp; his momentum killing, run stopping, back breaking 3's"
"You're right, Nets are 21-14 in the east and 19-6 in the west, so shoutout Joe Harris with a 25 point game! (Not sure if I should multiply the block by 1.25 or not...)"
Your knockdown shooter choice: Porter Jr. or Joe Harris?
"Blake Griffin, Mike James, and Joe Harris with +17 or better"
"Prediction: Fournier drifts from Joe Harris, Pass to Joe Harris open 3 in."
Fournier leaves Joe Harris open every time by creeping to the next closest guy. Expect a 3.
Fournier left Joe Harris open again
"KD was literally in MVP talks this season for the 24 games he played. Kyrie has the best statistical season of his career 27/5/6 with 1 steal on 51/39/92  AD played just 23 games all season before playing 15 mins last game, was hurt from day 1 and put up the worst stats of his career since his sophomore year.   You think people would rather have Trez+Dennis than Kyrie + Joe Harris? lol  Not even a close comparison"
"Joe Harris receives most of his passes from Harden (23.4%) with Kyrie close second (18.9%). But his 3-pt percentage is way better when he receives the pass from Kyrie. Make of that what you will, but here is his numbers:  * From Kyrie: 0.7/1.2, 57.5% * From Harden: 0.7/1.8, 40.2%"
Meanwhile if you breath on joe Harris it’s a foul
joe harris getting every call lol
Do you consider 29 year old Joe Harris on a 4/75 as an average contract?
Joe Biden (criminal reform in the 90s) and Kamala Harris (as a prosecuting attorney) have done plenty of terrible thing to put black people behind bars.
"I'd really like the know how efficient he would be if he got regular shots like guys like Joe Harris, JJ Redick or hell even Klay Thompson. The degree of difficulty on his shots is just completely insane and goes against everything we expect from an efficient player."
"Tbh I’m not sure if they know what’s going on or not.  Talking about how players are feeling and talking about the game at a simple level is what most fans want.  The extent to which my family analyzes the game is “the refs are really screwing us!!”  The extent to which I analyze it is “man we gotta stop this guy” or “man we gotta take better shots.”  I doubt very many people are watching going “oh even though they’ve got James Harden double teamed, they’re not allowing Joe Harris to hit his spots so Kyrie has to play a lot of iso ball” or some shit"
The team was 27th in defensive rating. So Butler wasn't exactly bringing the d.  The team played better with Butler because he's a good player but also because they didn't have any good wing depth. If they would've had Joe Harris instead of Crawford to fill in the gap then the team. A guy on here calculated that Crawford was the least valuable player in the league that year AND he was playing significant time for the Wolves
Highly doubt Duncan gets more than Joe Harris and Bertans got last year but you never know in free agency
"I'm not saying you're implying it and I'm also not saying Joe Harris did it on purpose, given how fast the game goes but that was dangerous contact. That could've been a naaaasty landing."
"even still thybulle’s offball defence leaves something to be desired, especially navigating screens and pindowns. booker is ball dominant so it’s no surprise thybulle was able to harass him but when he defended 3 point snipers that move offball a lot (like curry, pg, joe harris) he was getting burnt.  he’s only a sophomore so he’ll improve on that side somewhat but without an offensive game his ceiling is something like roberson’s"

"This happened with Joe Harris today.. was 4/4 from 3 in the first quarter, and only scored 1 bucket in the rest of the game. Teams will defend you differently if you start off hot like that."
"Bad take.  Also I called the Nets injuries back in December. When you build a team that consists of 3 aging superstars, Joe Harris, and a bunch of mostly-scrubs, you’re gonna lean too hard on those 3 superstars (one of whom was coming back from a serious injury) and they’re gonna get hurt. That shit is on Steve Nash and the Nets front office. Nobody gets to call the Nets the best team in the league when that judgement is based on a hypothetical scenario where 3 guys play 40 minutes a night for 72 games in 5 months and not run into problems.  Lakers aren’t that much better. Lebron is 36 and hasn’t been injury free the past few years. AD is 28 (which isn’t old, but isn’t young) and has had a variety of injuries in his career, and the Lakers all but depend on those two to win them games. They’re probably a playoff team but definitely not better than a first round exit without those two.  Jazz’s oldest major players are Conley and Ingles. Conley has been rested a LOT to prevent injuries this year. Ingles has rested a couple games too—which is huge because prior to this season he had the longest streak in the NBA of not missing a game. He also plays EXTREMELY low-impact non-physical basketball. It’s easy to see how he avoids injuries just watching him play. The rest of the Jazz are either mid-career or young, and they’ve all been played carefully.  Also helps that the Jazz team is deep—they miss a couple guys, and they probably still win.  And that’s why the Jazz have the best record. They’re hands down one of the best teams—i think even if the Laker’s and Nets were healthy they’d be competing for the top spot in the league—but they’re THE best in terms of the way they were built by the front office and the way they’re managed by their coach and staff, and, well, as the standings show, that shit is important.  The Jazz are proof (as if the Durant/Curry/Thompson team wasn’t proof enough) that Superteam/Superstar basketball is dangerous and relies heavily on health to be sustainable. Which is why it’s so shitty that regular season play isn’t rewarded more. If the only important part of the season is the playoffs, teams don’t give a fuck if players get injuries as long as they can scrape a low playoff seed and then bring them back and hope for the best for the important one month at the end of the season. Rewarding regular season play would force teams to build sustainable lineups and take care of their players in the long haul."
"NBA finals: Joe Harris vs Alex Caruso   Adam Silver: there’s no more injuries than average, here are my stats"
"Being efficient while the entire offense runs through you and your surrounding cast can't take advantage is insanely tough. Especially when running into teams with legendary peremeter defenders like the Warriors.  His third options and fourth options went from Ariza/Capela. To guys like Joe Harris/Shamet as his 4th options.  In the playoffs keyeing into the first option Harden was easy. On a team like the Nets in the playoffs it's an entirely different team, and actually watching him play on the Rockets its pretty easy to see how his team couldn't buy a bucket without him."
Need Joe Harris to end us
"Not sure. There's something to be said about a player who almost always gets a decent look from 3 because he can simply shoot over defenders. It's one thing to be amazing at hitting open 3's like Joe Harris (+50%), but being able to hit 36% on contested 3's (Harris is at 30%) has a different kind of value. But maybe that touches more on the idea of ""scoring"" rather than ""shooting"""
And yet they still shipped out Joe Harris when he looked good and would have played a lot in 2018.
No shit. You're comparing a potential franchise player to role players. Who's better? Zion or Joe Harris?
Yeah he is the best shooter the league has seen.  But Joe Harris is shooting 48% is that because he's a better shooter than curry or he is just in a stacked team and getting open looks?  My point is Steph is not as far from the rest of the all time great shooters as this stats would make it seem. Where he seperates himself is his ability to create his own shot which explains why he's numbers didn't dip this year.  But Klay is definitely not a unanimous 2nd greatest shooter of all time.
His ability to hit those while moving is insane. He’s better than Joe Harris in that regard
"Tbh that wouldn’t be a problem for them. If whatever system they ran was broken up then all of Harden, KD and Kyrie can just iso and steamroll teams. Even Joe Harris can shoot lights out with an entire defence focused on him"
"KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris?, Who the fuck else?, Blake Griffin  seems reasonable"
"Joe Harris shot better when he moves lol. Knew he was gonna miss the FT.  Anyway shoutout to the depleted Nets. Shamet played well, and Kyrie willed this win tonight."
Joe Harris
"I'm always thought Joe Harris was a better FT shooter, like in the high 80s."
No one is even attempting to guard Joe Harris
"Other than 2000 what other ones   01 pau gasol, Zach Randolph, Tont Parker, Joe Johnson, tyson chandler, Richard Jefferson, gerald wallace     02 yao ming, amare stoudemire, caron butler, nene, tayshaun prince, John salmons, Mike Dunleavy    03 is obvious    04 Dwight Howard, Emeka Okafor, Ben Gordon, lol deng, andre igouldala, Devin Harris, al Jefferson, Jr Smith, Josh Smith, Tony Allen    05 Cp3, Deron Williams Andrew Bynum, Andrew bogut, Danny granger, David Lee, gerald Green, nate Robinson    06 Rondo, Lowry, Aldridge, Brandon Roy, Jr Reddick, rudy gay"
"The Nets outside of their big 3 have Joe Harris (one of the top 3 poimt shooters), Landry Shamet ( slowly turning into one of the best 3 poimt shooters), Jeff Green ( very valuable role player), Blake Griffin ( still decent) and Claxton who is a very versatile defender. Who tf do the sixers have outside of their big 3? Danny Green and shake Milton? Who do the bucks have on their supporting cast? A 36 year old PJ Tucker? Lmao."
"Giannis only has 10 first baskets. You can look at it here https://www.degendata.com/  There's really no theme, just depends on what each teams do. Some teams do tend to run the same set/get it to the same person each first possession but not similar between teams. Joe Harris surprisingly has the most for the Nets but then like Embiid and Giannis have the most for their teams"
"Kyrie dropped 37 points on your ""elite defense"" while fasting LMAO. Kd and Harden will dominate and are also going to draw so much attention that shooters like Joe Harris and Landry Shamet are going to be wide open. Also Embiid scored 39 points on 30 shots, I'll live with that any day."
"Joe Harris is always forgotten in these conversations. Sharpshooter who can drive, rebound, hustles on defense. A top NBA role player"
IIRC the only two players on the Nets who were also on the team 2 years ago are Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.   That’s pretty absurd for them to be the championship favorite now.
"Zion will have 40 on 85% shooting, but somehow the Pels will blow a 10 point lead with a minute left when Joe Harris hits 4 straight wide open threes."
I’d honestly take Joe Harris before Dame in that department
"Harden has Kyrie, KD and Joe Harris - no comparison"
Joe Harris and Bruce Bowen are still leagues better than whatever the hell we would have
"There’s definitely doubt. Warriors aren’t a top 8 team in the West with Draymond, Wiggins, Wiseman... that team isn’t bad.  Did you see what Harden was doing with DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, etc?   Curry is a great ceiling raiser. Not a great floor raiser. The floor is the problem with the Warriors."
Joe Harris on warriors
If you're gonna list role players like that you might as well list guys like Joe Harris for Kd and Steve Kerr for MJ lmao. What a joke. Kyle Korver shot 9% from 3 in the 2018 NBA finals. Meanwhile Steve Kerr hit a game winning shot in the Finals and has the highest 3 point % of all time.
We would want more. The problem is you guys at least got to keep Joe Harris and got some decent guys to at least round out the bench.   Considering Hardens injuries this year we might have been in serious trouble of even making the playoffs
Basketball isn’t measured by TS %. Melo averaged twice as many points as him during that run. Next Are you going to tell me that Joe Harris is better than LeBron?
Also just had Danny Green and Tobias Harris vs Jeff Green and Joe Harris
"Bruh the Nets have JAMES HARDEN and KD, 2 of the top 3 scorers in nba history on their team. They also have Kyrie Irving who might be the best 3rd option in nba history. When you have those 3 guys and shooters surrounding them their defense just has to be slightly average for them to win everything. Because at the end of the day Dennis Shroder, Kuzma and Drummond won't mean shit when Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, and Landry Shamet are getting wide open looks because teams are trying to double Harden and Durant."
Who's guarding Durant? Who's guarding Harden? Who's garudimg Kyrie? Are you going to leave Joe Harris and Shamet open if you try and double them? There's virtually no way of stopping the Nets offense.
Question: what player can hesitate and still make that shot? seems like everyone besides Curry and Joe Harris miss that.
"Yes. At their peaks Westbrook and KD were arguably top 5 players, and they also had Adams and Ibaka who were quality players   Then he went to the Warriors which most people agree was the greatest team ever assembled. The Shaq Kobe lakers were great and both those guys were MVP candidates but there weren’t two other all NBA level players on their team, same with the Bulls. Only other team that could come close to the fire power might be the 1986 Celtics with Larry, McHale, parish and Dennis Johnson. Bill Simmons specifically wrote that the 1986 Celtics couldn’t happen again because of salary caps. Now he’s with Kyrie, Harden, DJ, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, etc.  The list of guys who he’s played with at or close to their peak are Steph, Klay, Russ, Harden, Kyrie, Draymond, Ibaka.  There are 3 other MVPs on that list, multiple all NBA players, and it wasn’t like bird playing with a broken down Bill Walton."
"Clearly not he has endless potential and is a player that we don’t get to see often in the nba. The combination of athleticism, shooting and height. If I would be a GM in the NBA and would have the money to pay him I would clearly pay him the max. You have to account that player like joe Harris and Duncan Robinson are paid this kind of money that you are suggesting. They are valuable and specialists but don’t have nearly the potential that mpj possesses"
homer answer: Joe Harris  actual answer: Jimmy Butler or Trae Young
"Only reason Jimmy wasn't chosen was he was out for a long time but I count him as an all star. CJ or Joe Harris for me, dude's a fucking SHOOTER"
"&gt;Their roster construction makes no sense  Even just a Burks, Bullock, Korkmaz, off-brand Danny Green/Joe Harris would help us a lot honestly. Zion generates a lot of open looks, but no one can knock them down."
I just don’t see a world where the Nets win it all. KD and Kyrie have extensive injury histories and Harden has an extensive history of folding under pressure in the playoffs.  Maybe Joe Harris can carry the load?
We broke his streak just like we broke Joe Harris streak of 1 3pt a game in our win vs the Nets earlier in the season
Joe Harris? Dinwiddie potentially coming back? Heat had nothing comparable imo.
190 million dollar Joe harris
"Easy to get an assist record when your teammates are Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Joe Harris"
"They made some huge roster changes this season and very quickly became the one of the favorites for the championships. As a result they have a lot of bandwagon fans that don’t really know too much about basketball or the team and those people are the most toxic. I don’t see that as a reason not to like them though. Just have a sense of humor about yourself and the team and you’re better than 90% of other people that started following this year.  The team itself is very entertaining to watch. Of our big three, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, all of them have very different play styles. Harden is a monster of a point guard, very good at getting buckets and even better at assists. Kyrie is one of the best ball handlers playing the game today and his playing is always smooth. Durant is almost as famous for his antics on social media as he is for his bball skills and the man is on many lists as one of the top three players. He makes the difficult look easy, a master of his craft.   Besides the superstars, there’s Joe Harris, one of the best three point shooters in the NBA having the best year in his career. They have three young players, Alize Johnson, Shamet, and Nic Claxton, with a lot of hustle whenever they come off the bench.   Basically, it’s a team with a very new roster and high offensive potential but glaring defensive weaknesses. It’s a great opportunity to watch three future hall of famers play together."
"dinwiddie is gone after this year in 95% of scenarios for this tax reason. retaining him is gonna cost us 50-60 million dollars which we just arent going to do. Also if we keep the big 3 after the next 2 years its also entirely possible that shamet/claxton are gone. we have them under contract for another two years but theyre going to want bigger contracts. if we keep joe harris just him and the big 3 will be over the tax line. so we're just going to be so deep in the tax and in the repeater tax it seems impossible. if after the next 2 years we do drop the big 3 then we can keep those guys minus kyrie, i think its difficult to predict what he actually chooses to do.  And if we lose the big 3, harris, claxton, shamet, bruce brown is probably one of the worst teams in the league if not the worst"
Joe Harris. Rip Jarrett allen :(
Damn is Joe Harris really the 5th best player in NY?
"is it? just looking at old drafts i see guys like draymond green, khris middleton, spencer dinwiddie, will barton, jae crowder, jimmy butler, jerami grant, joe harris, malcolm brogdon, josh richardson, pascal siakam, dillon brooks, kyle anderson, etc, etc.. who were picked late that definitely improved from their rookie year to later career, and some of them were older when they were drafted too. dudes who prove themselves to be nba material will usually make some strides early in their career as they adjust to the speed and physicality of the nba. plus, having million dollar contracts on the line is a good incentive to hone your skills. i think the problem is that not many people in the 2nd round are nba material to begin with.  if youre talking about ""jumping tiers"" uhh sure, i dont think bane will be an all star, but there's enormous variance in the value of non all stars. if he can be even a top 100 player in the nba, how is that not a steal?  like half of the top 10 in a lot of drafts are busts.   also grayson was bad his rookie year, ask any jazz fan. true shooting percentage is 10% higher now with more volume and he can actually play defense. 40 pt game came on 11/30 shooting."
Big Joe Harris fan?
The team that doesn't have Joe Harris as a starter.
"Claxton, brown, shamet, Joe Harris, Kyrie, and possibly even dinwiddie could very likely all be on the team at that point. Fill out the rest of the roster and that team is fighting for the playoffs.   Basically there’s almost no way of predicting the future and if there’s a gm that can get us back to a good spot fast, it’s Sean Marks."
Davis Bertans and Joe Harris. Bad bad men from beyond the arc
"Harden is the most overrated player in the NBA THIS YEAR*  Emphasis on this year because people believe he is the MVP or a top 3 candidate at least. I cannot agree with rating a player so high based on how they play with excellent teammates and overlook their play with worse teammates. Harden averages roughly 11 assists with one of the best scorers/shooters ever in KD, a guy who may enter the 50/40/90 club this season in Kyrie, another guy who was pretty close for a whole in Joe Harris, another almost 50/40 player in Jeff green.  He's surrounded by excellent shooters and yet people are going so far as to say he's a top 3 player? For me eve. Top 5 has to be argued. I'm not a Harden hater by any means but I got LeBron, Giannis, Curry easy above him. Also KD, Kawhi, Embiid. And Jokic are also all players having seasons that put them on par or above Harden this year.  And the people who say KD isn't the best on the Nets Cuz of Harden? Maybe you say that because he hasn't played as much but the numbers? 28/7/5 on FIFTY FOUR PECENT SHOOTING? In 34 minutes I mean cmon. People act like KD is a shell of his former self..."

"How the fuck do they have the 3 stars + Joe Harris AND all those decent bench players? Fucking Houston, man.. They'd also have Lamarcus if not for the unfortunate health issue."
Joe Harris
Durant's 25 points on 12 shots would have been impressive if Joe Harris didn't score 26 points on 12 shots.
Need the clip of him calling Joe Harris a real lunch pail guy.
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"Seth Curry  He’s a great bench player but a probably a below average starter. He’s thought of as an elite shooter, which he is, but it’s on way too low a volume. He just passed up way too many semi-open looks, probably because his shot is so slow. His spacing is still very valuable, but shooting-wise I don’t consider him the same tier as flamethrowers like Hield, Joe Harris, even Danny."
"harden   ad  are my 2 all star caliber players.  Can just spam pnr all day with arguably the best offensive engine+best pnr roll man.  then siakam for 3rd guy in marion role.  good defender and pretty versatile and should thrive more as a 3rd option.  Then I want a shooter and 3nD guys.  I dont need a raja level defender since i have ad over stoudemire so I'll go joe harris at other guard and crowder at sf.  Little more realistic with crowder since he doesnt make that much money.  Clarkson can score off bench,  Harden, Harris,Crowder, Siakam, AD, Ckarkson as top 6 is good"
The original post was about last year’s Lakers. THT was not in the rotation. Only Caruso and Kuzma were. Claxton and Joe Harris are both home grown. Joe wasn’t drafted by the Nets but he literally didn’t play in his brief stint in CLE and the Nets built him up from scratch. He was nothing when Nets brought him in. Claxton is probably our starting C now. Again: stop splitting hairs
Joe Harris &amp; David Nwaba
"If KD is playing 40+ minutes a night at the 3, the nets are doing something wrong. Joe Harris at the 3 and KD at the 4 is just a much better lineup.  That said, agree the nets aren’t sorely in need of guard depth"
"Yeah, that's what we need to get back into contention, a Joe Harris type."
"I mean he’s probably gonna be a good shooter, could be a Joe Harris type"
"Kd, Harden, Kyrie, and joe harris gonna feast against their entire court, what's the difference?"
They are catch and shoot because he moves off ball to get opportunities. Steph catch and shoot are not equal to Joe Harris catch and shoot
"Harrisson Barnes , Marcus Smart , Joe Harris Brook Lopez and Kemba Walker are gonna end up being the starting 5."
"Lol, Klay's shot profile is more like Joe Harris. Check their unassisted 3% and attempts, it's clearly Dame"
"I want him to start as a fan of his, but I honestly think he has great 6th man potential. Doesn't hve to be sixth man of the year but he can be very similar to Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams. Only issue is the contract he has now and it might force him to start, but if he is willing to come off the bench, I think he can live up to 20 million of that contract.  The guy can legit play even though last two games have been one of those bad D lo games. Still, he has many games where he can create buckets and can be big for the Wolves.  I still think he can start with KAT, but they need better defensive pieces around him and KAT and some help.  I also think he can be a really good off-ball scoring shooter like how Joe Harris and JJ Reddick play but with better offensive versaility. Sort of like how Jason Terry was with the Mavericks."
nah its joe harris and his support james harden
"I do think the one to take away is Joe Harris might struggle against good defenses in the playoffs. He has in the past, could barely get a shot off against philly last year. And tonight it happened again.  He'll have more space and less focus when the big 3 are out there of course but still something to keep an eye on. I have a feeling Brown will be playing a lot with the starting unit"
"Yeah, you need a top 5 player or 2 top-10 players at least to win the championship. (Or very very rarely 3 top-15 or 4 top-20...)   Joe Harris is nice to have but in the end he is replaceable. Harden isn't."
Charles was right. I'm sorry but Joe Harris ain't the key to anything for the Nets.
Its not a 99.99% chance to miss it. They can make this shots. I bet Joe Harris could easily go 5/15 from there
Charles 100%. Joe Harris could probably miss the entire playoffs and the nets would still be heavy favorites
The East runs through Joe Harris
Joe Harris is the key to the nets success? Wut Shaq
Joe Harris is not utilized as well or often as he should be without Harden
"Harris and Shamet have been absolute ass lately. These guys need to step it up. Tired of tentative Joe. Dude is not looking confident right now, he's hesitating to shoot and is not finishing around the rim the way he was earlier.  Shamet is just not making his shots"
Haven’t seen a lot of nets games...but this team does seem great for harden. A lot of stationary dudes who’ll be wide open when harden draws 5 defenders. Watching joe Harris and green and others try to create is rough.
i'm feeling generous today. I'll give you guys one thj for KD and joe harris and some picks
"Curry is a better finisher from literally everywhere on the court without having the spacing of KD, Harden, Joe Harris etc. Just cos Kyrie is flashier doesn't make him better."
Shamet try to be Joe Harris with the off the dribble 3s but he be bricking
"Why not? Jrue played amazing defense on Kyrie. Giannis will be on KD more in the playoffs not sure if Jrue or Middleton will be on Harden.   Sunday the bucks “big 3” together combined for a total of 96 points.   Tuesday the bucks big 3 combined for a total of 82 pts   So let’s say all 3 on the Nets do score 30 pts every game which isn’t going to happen. It’s going to come down to defense and the shooters around our 3 and the Nets 3. I’m 100% more confident in our defense and the shooters around us helping us than I am Joe Harris and Green helping the Nets.   If any of the 3 on the Nets has an off game that could very well cost them. Their defense was horrid and I honestly don’t see it getting better I mean they let Giannis make a ton of 3s and mid range shots.   Obviously KD can’t be stopped but I believe Giannis can slow him down a bit, if Jrue is on Harden or Kyrie he will definitely be able to slow them down a little unless they just come out making everything which could happen or Jrue is having an off game defensively."
"The more I read what you're writing, the more I start to question how well you understand how individual skills and performance add up to wins and losses and championships.  I'm not saying that to antagonize you.  Promise I'm not.  But when you say things like ""If X and Y he would still average over 20ppg"" the alarm bells go off.     That sounds suspiciously like last century thinking.  The goal of the game is not to score 20 points.  The goal is to win.     And then there's this:   &gt;""But he's a top 10 passer, top 15 finisher, top 5 defender, and top 5 downhilll/fastbreak player.  So, l'm sure you can understand my position as well.""   I understand but I don't agree with the premise.  Leaving aside whether I would actually rank him in those spots (I wouldn't), the problem is some of these skills cannot be separated from each other.     In particular, passing is inextricable from scoring threat, which is inextricable from shooting threat.  You may functionally be a good passer, in terms of ability to see passes and make passes, but if you cannot shoot the ball the defense can choose to take away angles while giving up the shot that you cannot make.  No one does this consistently in the regular season but EVERYONE does it consistently in the postseason, which is why players like Simmons and Westbrook and others never have the kind of postseason impact you would expect based on their reputation.       Even Giannis, whom I do consider to be a tier or two above Simmons in terms of physical tools, and certainly an elite player, always looks far more flawed in the playoffs.  Poor shooting also makes everything that teammates try to do more difficult.  A non-shooter is just a massive liability when he doesn't have the ball, and there's only one of those to share among 5 players.  Meanwhile a great shooter makes everything the other players do easier just by existing on the court.       You also have to ask yourself questions of scalability.   E.g., how does this player limit your options for roster construction.  When you have a player like Simmons, it's really REALLY difficult to put him on the floor with other guys who are not shooters, and shooting is the most expensive skill on the market.  (How much did Bertans get as basically a 1-tool player... like $80m or something?  Joe Harris too.  That's the new normal.).   It's much easier and more affordable to have a quality shooter who lacks in other areas as the centerpiece such as Harden, and then fill in his problems with role players (the main one being his lack of lateral defensive quickness).  Another good counterexample is (hypothetically healthy) Klay Thompson, who is basically infinitely scaleable:  30/30 nba teams would take him and he would fit like a glove from day 1.     So when I say Simmons not top 40, this is what I'm talking about.  Imagine an alternate reality where all nba players went back into a pool and the 30 nba teams had to redraft, and the plan was to repeat this draft each season so as not to make decisions based on potential and youth and whatnot.  Under this scenario I would not have Simmons anywhere close to the top of my board because there are too many potential pitfalls with him."
Cuz we got Joe Harris and Landry Shamet for that
"There is not a player in the NBA I'd rather have taking mid range shots than KD. He's a historically efficient mid range scorer who just so happens to also be able to shoot 3's. He doesn't need to put up 10 3's a game to be elite, it breaks down the defense when they have to send 2 people to him when he's 1v1 in the mid range, which opens up the floor for players like Joe Harris/or someone cutting to the rim."
"Before that was BRoy, Spencer Hawes, Martell Webster (from Seattle and was supposed to go to UW before he went pro), IT, Justin Holiday, Terrence Ross, and Dejounte Murray. Most of them were local guys on top of all that. Guess you can also include players like Lavine, Joe Harris, Kevin Porter Jr., etc.  Crazy how we still don’t have a team even when we’re putting out the type of talent that we are here in the PNW."

TS is overrated when a player takes less than 15 FGA. Guys like Joe Harris and Ingles are overrrated. Let them shoot 15+ times and they will drop from 70% to 60% and less. Its stupid to compare Joe Ingles TS with 8 FGA and Steph Curry TS with 22 FGA
His playstyle and game is pretty much similar to Joe Harris.
"wrong, but then again the bucks proved that.  The nets offensive efficiency near the end of a close game is much better with harden distributing the ball.  And kyrie is much more dangerous when he can concentrate on what he does best, breaking down his man on the wing.  PG an be very physical, Id rather have Jrue holliday trying to guard harden as that wil wear holiday down instead of holliday wearing down Kyrie.  Ask KD, you dont think he knows that?  He knows more than any of us how the pieces fit.  Kyrie has never averaged more than 7 assists a game in 10 seasons.  What he does do is score with tremendous efficiency.  What harden does do is run the most efficient offense, the nets get lots of production out of guys like claxton, joe harris, and bruce brown.  What kyrie does best is breaking down his man in the clutch, better he has energy in the 4th quarter."
"yes, I agree, when you look at productivity and efficiency of guys like bruce brown, Nic claxton, jeff green and joe harris with harden running the offense its notably better.  Harden distorts the defense from the point, and finds these guys for easy shots.  Kyrie and KD score regardless of harden being on the floor, but even they are more efficient when harden runs the offense.  And opponents have to double harden, guys like Jrue Holiday do well against a smaller less physical Kyrie, but harden is a beast physically so holliday has his hands full, leaving a better mismatch for kyrie in that one case.  If harden doesnt come back healthy, I dont like the nets chances against the 76ers or Bucks.  You really want simmons and Jrue Holiday guarding harden, not kyrie.  this forces thybulle or others to guard Kyrie and I really like that matchup a lot better."
Tatum PF is correct.  Kd should be PF too since Joe Harris is Nets’ starting SF.
"It's got some pretty obvious flaws just looking at players on the same teams.   First example I see looking at the charts is Donte DiVicenzo has a 2.27 RPM. Jrue's is a little bit over him at 2.49 and Khris is just underneath him at 1.96. It's hard to imagine how Donte is even roughly as impactful as the other two players.   Devonte Graham is at a 3.72 vs Scary Terry's 2.77 and Ball is at 1.15 and Hayward is at 1.13. I don't think anyone would consider Graham as significantly more impactful than the other players.   Joe Harris ranks above Kyrie but the really baffling part is that Harris is a negative in offense by this metric and just blows Kyrie out of the water defensively while Kyrie is good on offense and just barely positive in defense.   Outside of the realm of teammates, you have some very big ones. Lonzo is the 9th most impactful player. Duncan Robinson rates as a better shooting guard than Lavine and Brown and Spyda. Danny Green and Kyle Anderson are the 5th and 6th best small forwards by this metric.   This whole spiel just to say that it's a wonky stat that isn't trustworthy"
"Here’s their likely playoff rotation:   1. KD  2. Harden  3. Kyrie  4. Joe Harris  5. Jeff Green  6. Blake Griffin  7. Claxton  8. DJ  Reserves: Shamet, Mike James, Tyler Johnson, TLC, Chiozza  That’s an all time great rotation."
They’ve got two good role players in Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan. What they’ve got otherwise is a lot of not-terrible filler that is okay sometimes and really not good other times.
Both Harden and Irving are going to step away from the team making them untradeable and then the Nets will trade Joe Harris for Damian Lillard.  They've done it before.
Middleton.   Joe Harris.  Lavine.
"His volume isn't high though, I think even Joe Harris shoots more than he does but Ingles is the superior playmaker and ft shooter.  His numbers with Mitchell and Conley injured would drop that quite a bit.  I'm still personally confused at how Harris is so average at the ft line with that stroke."
"I mean the only guys who can shoot on their roster are: Kyrie,Harden,KD,Jeff Green,Joe Harris and Blake. And a lot of these guys positions overlap so kinda hard to put up a lineup who can play 5 out. Also the big 3 has barely played together."
Im kinda surprised by where the Nets are on this. I would think having 2 superstars on the court (they usually dont have 3) and guys like joe harris would make for some really good spacing for their stars. But they're just middle of the pack.
1. Jokic 2. Beal 3. Edwards 4. Joe Harris 5. Shake Milton
"Joe Harris is a starter on almost any team in the league.  I could even see this version of Blake being a starter if a team required it, but even then he’s a great 6th man at this point"
Joe Harris was a second rounder
Thing is you don't make franchise altering personel decisions based on the whim of Joe Harris or Buddy Hield
trash? joe harris is trash? blake is trash? jeff green is trash? bruce brown trash?
"Buddy is still like, a top 15 all time 3-pt shooter. He’s got a lot of flaws and gets a lot of hate on our sub, but I think he can be good still, on the kings or not.  If it was him instead of Joe Harris on the Nets, I think Buddy would be looked at in a much more positive light"
"I agree with that. Scoring records =/= championships and Wilt only has 2 of them. I don't think saying that is as nonsensical as you're implying.  &amp;#x200B;  I will admit the generational difference and change in play style, but I will also bring up the fact that the reason for this change in play style is because of Steph Curry himself. Now, its value in this argument relies heavily upon whether you find that important or not, but regardless it is still a factor that needs to be brought up. Additionally, I would argue that this change in play style wouldn't matter at all. Players these days are becoming better and better shooters, and sports technology has also made huge leaps. Honestly I would genuinely argue that he has no ""true competition"" at all. Even his own teammate Klay Thompson who benefits from Steph's gravity ""only"" has 5 such games with 10 or more threes, good for second all time. Steph Curry has 21. Basically what I'm trying to say is: regardless of how good a shooter you were even in the 2000s, even with all the advancements in technology we have now and the shift in emphasis to shooting nowadays, you would still shoot relatively similar to a Joe Harris, Klay Thompson, or Buddy Hield. Nothing to scoff at, for sure: those guys are incredible 3 point shooters. But the bottomline is still there: you will never be Steph Curry."
Sunday the bucks “big 3” together combined for a total of 96 points.   Tuesday the bucks big combined for a total of 82 pts   So let’s say all 3 on the Nets do score 30 pts every game which isn’t going to happen. It’s going to come down to defense and the shooters around our 3 and the Nets 3. I’m 100% more confident in our defense and the shooters around us helping us than I am Joe Harris and Green helping the Nets.   If any of the 3 on the Nets has an off game that could very well cost them.
They don’t need harden to drop 30. They need him to help get looks for joe Harris and lobs for east buckets. Harden makes us a lot better on offense there’s just no way around it.   I agree these whole hypothetical posts are dumb but acting like harden won’t be a huge difference maker is also dumb.
"&gt; but there are players who shoot a higher percentage on 3 pointers   I think for this to be even remotely fair you have to look at the quality of the shots attempted by those players. Majority of those players shoot exclusively catch and shoot (or catch, pump fake, side dribble, shoot) 3s whereas Curry shoots ridiculous off the dribble 3s that have no business going in the basket. Even the best 3 point shooter this season percentage wise (who I assume is Joe Harris but correct me if I'm wrong) is most likely exclusively a catch and shooter.   But you know, I kind of do see your point. No team is building around Joe Harris or Buddy Hield just because they're good 3 point shooters. Regardless though, I would definitely argue that no one could replicate what Steph is doing even if they're given the amount of shots he takes on a nightly basis. Joe Harris shooting 10+ 3s a night would not be able to hit as many 3s as Steph over the course of a full season. Granted, we wouldn't ever be able to know that for sure, but I would rather take the guy who's proven that he's capable of doing it year after year over the guy who maybe might be able to do it if he takes enough 3s for a full season."
Well no. It would maybe be a Klay Thompson vs Joe Harris. But steph shoots in completely different ways and compared to the people who shoot in the same ways as him he obliterates them in efficiency.  You could maybe say steph vs Lavine as he's one of the only one whose shooting on c+s and off the dribble are both elite with a good number of possessions each like steph.
Zion is also taking 50% more shots (per possession) at the rim than peak Shaq/Giannis/Dwight/(anyone in NBA history since the stat is recorded).     His efficiency also increases if you don't count putbacks of his own shots as another possession.   This is a less extreme version of Curry vs Joe Harris.
"Claxton, Bruce Brown and honestly even Joe Harris all need Harden to come back. They are a noticeable step down without him. And Jeff Green is still good but but damn he really stretches teams when Harden is out there, their chemistry is fantastic.   People were claiming the Nets role players were elite and acting like Marks built the greatest depth in NBA history. Marks is great, I love him, and I like this team, but a lot of these players were getting elevated heavily by Harden. If we still had LMA that isn't even as important because that's a guy that can do it himself too, but without him it's really tough because Clax is obviously our best 5 and he badly needs Harden out there."
"&gt; Aside from the big 3 who on their team can they depend on to score enough to matter?  “Aside from two top 5 All-Time scorers and Kyrie, who can they depend on to score?”  You realize they have the #1 offense in the league with KD and Harden missing significant time right?   And honestly yes, there’s a real chance all 3 might average 30.  And to answer your question, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, Blake Griffin"
Joe Harris for the love of god pls hit more 3s or play half the defense as Klay
Bryn “Joe Harris” Forbes
Lol. Playmaking and defense. Get’s Joe Harris wayyy more open looks. Turns Clax + DJ into a lob threat. He literally transforms the team.   We lost like 7 games or something while he’s played for us including beating this Bucks team without Kyrie. Watch some games bud
KD primarily generates offense for himself and occasionally creates shots for others.  Harden generates shots for other players first and foremost on this team and also can create his own shot.   Harden makes guys like Joe Harris and Jeff Green shine.
Sixers fans remember playoff Joe Harris
getting annoyed with Joe Harris. He constantly plays like shit against top teams.
"They literally got rid of the young core, they traded away all the players that made the Nets special sans joe Harris. This is basketball gentrification, it wouldn’t sit right with me to see the knicks trade Randle, RJ and Mitch for Kawhi, Dame and Lavine. I’m not saying that would happen anyways but that’s basically what the Nets did, they traded their identity and culture for the business move of having star appeal. KD and Kyrie didn’t choose the Nets because they had Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen, they chose them because they had cap space and were willing to also sign their friend deandre Jordan. They literally fired their head coach, the person who sets the tone for a teams work ethic and culture, to appease KD and Kyrie. This was the gentrification of a grass roots team that beat the odds, just to sell more jerseys to Midwest transplant Brooklyn hipsters."
1. KD Harden  2. Kyrie Harden  3. KD Kyrie  4. Harden Joe Harris  5. KD Joe Harris
"I mean statistically better doesn’t mean actually better, I feel like he sacrificed more statistically speaking on those warrior teams. His comeback is insane but it doesn’t surprise me he’d be scoring more with a backcourt of Kyrie/Joe Harris as opposed to the splash bros"
"The TS% is undestandable, but the shooting percentages were similar. D lo and Butler both shot like 43% from the field.  The issue with these know it all people is you fucking disrespect anyone who doesn't fit your smarter than everything criteria. Also what makes me annoyed is people always thinking Joe harris carried D lo.  I agree D lo didn't ""carry"" the team like you see what Jokic is doing withnthe Nuugets. Guys like Dinwiddie and Levert were even considered better, but D lo from like mid-December to end of the year was argaubly even the best guy. He balled out really well a month before the all-star game and after that picked up the slack.   I understand he can get overrated, but my issue is people disrespect something that is means a lot more to a guy like D lo. You can hate him all you want but I'm sick of people taking away small things from his career.  I don't care if he was a replacement or others might've been better, he earned that shit and played like an all star many times that season. Better than what he has done the past two years."
"The Nets big 3 is Harden, KD and Joe Harris right?  They wouldn't disrespect the best 3 point shooter in the world like that, right?"
All this help to beat Joe Harris?!?
"LeBron has played 10,811 playoff minutes, which is more than the regular season minutes any player from the 2016 draft class except Buddy Hield (10,906). He has more playoff minutes than Cody Zeller's regular season minutes, and he was drafted in 2013. More than Clint Capela, Rodney Hood, Joe Harris, and TJ Warren who have been in the league for seven years. More than Kelly Oubre or D'Angelo Russell. More than anyone from 2017 even if you include their playoff minutes.  Crazy durability."
Passing is a part of playmaking just like shooting is a part of scoring. There are great shooters who aren't great scorers(Joe Harris) and there are great scorers who aren't great shooters(Lebron). Then there are both(Durant) like CP3 who is a great passer and playmaker
"&gt;	The only thing that might remain out of those 3 is his shooting. He might be more of a joe harris/Duncan Robinson than an all nba guy when he comes back.  Even if that’s the only thing that comes back and the rest of his game is just serviceable, that’ll probably be enough to make the warriors competitive again.  Just his shotmaking at the level he does it at will keep defenses honest because then it’ll be a lot harder to just double steph every single possession which seems to be the goto move here for any team trying to slow steph down"
"Idk why any sort of honest opinion that doesnt sugarcoat things gets downvoted in r/nba  This is a completely fair perspective. What made klay special was his 3 pt shooting, ability to fight through screens darting all over the place on offense, and his good defense.  The only thing that might remain out of those 3 is his shooting. He might be more of a joe harris/Duncan Robinson than an all nba guy when he comes back."
"Wow, I thought Joe Harris was like 23-24 lol."
"Lol bring on Jeff Green or Joe Harris. They’re not bothering anyone. In fact I imagine we’ll be hunting both of them quite a bit on switches. KD and Claxton are the only two above average defenders in the nets regular rotation. The issue with the nets is they have 2-3 average to below average defenders on the floor at all times, the heat were able to hide Robinson and Herro because they rarely played together."
"What's the difference between getting a switch for KD and Kyrie vs. having Harden there to potentially making getting good switches easier? Not a lot.   And replacing Jeff Greens decent defence with Hardens bad D might be a worse overall trade off. You have a line up of Joe Harris, Irving and Harden to defend Gianiss - yikes."
No it doesn't. KD probably can't shoulder the burden of creating that much offense over the course of multiple series'  They need Harden healthy and back to most of his usual self for those possessions where KD/Kyrie aren't isolating.  He's so much better at getting the others involved and having Jeff Green or Joe Harris show up for 20 in some random game is what could win them a championship
&gt;They rely on too much hero ball.  Casual alert  Didn't see Bruce Brown putting up 29pts with the Harden pick and roll  Doesn't account for the fact that Joe Harris shot like ASS today (1/5 3pt) - He's a 49% 3pt shooter.  Doesn't credit that one of our best defensive players in Claxton didn't see the floor today
"No harden gets everyone involved   Joe Harris had 1 made three today, not happening with harden passing"
"That was a really fun game, sad that Joe Harris didn't show up tonight and Claxton was still out. Would love to see more of this in the playoffs"
Joe Harris or KD?
Treating Joe Harris in transition like he’s Andre Roberson is certainly one thing you could do
"Y’all really gave Prime Joe Harris KD, Kyrie AND Beard.  Smh games gone."
"“Robinson is expected to earn a sizable pay raise this upcoming offseason when he’s set to become a restricted free agent. He’s on a $1.7 million salary this season, and comparable players such as Brooklyn Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris signed a four-year, $75 million contract and Washington Wizards three-point specialist Davis Bertans signed a five-year, $80 million as free agents last offseason.”"

"Klay Thompson is a shooter, Joe Harris is a shooter, Duncan Robinson is a shooter- you don't hear any complains about them. Hield's problem is that he thinks his individual accolades as a college senior are worth a damn in the NBA. He still seems to believe that all those Player of the Year awards should at least translate to him being a number one option."
"How much did Joe Harris get again? That, but a bit less."
"Joe Harris was a 4 year college player who got drafted to a Cavs team that doesn't play rookies, then got hurt and the magic were dumb enough to cut him.   He was good straight away with the Nets, which was the first time he got real minutes in the NBA. Then took another leap after a few years to become the elite shooter he is now. Joe ingles obviously wasn't in the NBA at all as you said, and contributed as a role player pretty quickly after arriving.  I think fans hope the late bloomer thing will happen to guys who are in the league for 5 years, playing relatively consistent minutes and suck, Harris and Ingles are not an examples of that. It almost never happens that way."
"Joe Harris ain’t no 3&amp;D player lmao. Bull is 3 &amp; Midrange player, he ain’t defending anything lmao."
you lost me at 1. when you said Joe Harris is a 3 and D player
"I suppose but I think guys like Mikal Bridges and Danny Green can fit anywhere.  They have proven that regardless of who the coach is  or who is setting them up, they can take and make threes and play high level defense at a high rate.  For Bullock I have no doubt about his shooting.  He’s like Joe Harris in that it translates anywhere it’s just the defense I hold skepticism on."
"Joe Harris should not be considered a 3&amp;D player. I get your qualifications of ‘average defender’, but a 3&amp;D player should be able to guard the top player or 2nd option.  Harris may have those assignments but he is nowhere close to a lock down defender.  Covington should be higher. To me he’s the ultimate role player ‘3&amp;D player’ in the NBA. Did you see how well he played in that role for the Rockets last year?"
It’s both. I wouldn’t consider joe Harris a 3+d guy tbh he’s not enough defense.
"Blake, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet, Deandre Jordan, Luwawu-Cabarot, Claxton are all solid rotational pieces.   Steph/Draymond will show up but if that Nets team caught us on a day when Oubre/Wiggins aren't having good games then I can legitimately see us losing"
No it wouldn't. Their best player would be joe Harris. Warriors would fuck them up
"Wait, is joe Harris a good defender? Haven't watch much Nets games since D'angelo left"
"3&amp;D players originally meant defensive minded players whose only offensive contribution to shoot threes, like Bruce Bowen or Shane Battier. Nowadays, even the ""limited"" version of this list include guys like Joe Harris (not a defensive minded guy) or Tobias Harris (a 20 PPG scorer who scores mainly from midrange)."
"I feel like the criteria for ""D"" on this list is very liberal. ""3&amp;D"" is someone who plays good, not average defense and can space the floor. I would not consider Joe Harris, Tobias Harris, and Pat Connoughton (probably a few more too) to be 3&amp;D."
&gt;  Ideally you want at least 1-2 really good shooters on your team  That's the thing though- you make that sound so easy.  There just aren't that many shooters who are good enough all around players to stay on the floor.  It's the difference between Steve Novak/Ryan Anderson and Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris.
"&gt; Joe Harris, Seth Curry, and Marcus Morris  I was with you till the last name.  Morris is the classic example of a 3 and D guy, not a pure shooter.  I'm pretty sure he'd barely get minutes if he wasn't such a big, versatile defender."
"again, those are more exceptions. I could name 10-15 players who don't get much better or flame out of the league by 25 years old for every joe harris success story"
joe ingles didn't even make the league till 27 and didn't have a breakout year till 30. joe harris didn't have a breakout season till 27
"IMO a 3&amp;D player is one who gets nearly all of his points from the 3.  So you can't include players like Harris or VanVleet or Hayward  or Wiggins in there since they score a lot outside of 3s, and are sometimes the focus of the offense.     IMO a 3&amp;D player plays good D, not average D.   Wiggins ain't no D, I don't care how much GW fans think he has allegedly improved, he still shows up as a negative on D.  Joe Harris is also not a D guy.  You can't just eye test your way to the D part of this.   Nice try, I like the list, but you've just made a list of guys that shoot 3s but haven't made an all-star team in 2 years not 3&amp;D guys.  I do agree that true 3&amp;D guys aren't as widely available as people think."
"Agreed. People need to realize that a “shooter” is someone who can shoot the basketball at a very high level, not just league average. Guys like Joe Harris, Seth Curry, and Marcus Morris are guys I think are perfect examples of real “shooters.” In contrast, guys like Danuel House (he had one good year with us when he shot 41% from three IIRC, but since then he’s been league average) and P.J Tucker (he’s money from the corners but overall he’s a decent shooter at best) are guys who some people may think are “shooters” but really aren’t."
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"+/- is simply number of points the team gained while X player is on the court substracted by the number of points the opposing team scored while X player is playing.  So let’s say Joe Harris played a whole game without substitutions and the Nets scored a total of 110 pts. The opposing team meanwhile scored 115. Harris would then have a -5 +/-, regardless of whatever statline he gets."
"I’m glad you mentioned the 42 win season cause that just proved my point. Marks was responsible for trades that got us Dlo, and trades that landed us Allen/Caris Levert. He also made great pickups with Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.    Suns did not inherit the Billy king disaster, neither did you turn a historically irrelevant team, only 10 years into a new city, into a team with 3 HOF players. Everything your saying is great, but fails in comparison.   Another reason I’m glad you mentioned the 42 win season: it shows this was a slow build up. People think we just walked into KD/Kyrie/Harden. No, 2 of them were rumored to go to the Knicks all of that season prior to when they came to us. Marks built a playoff team then a championship favorite   Like idk man, Marks taking the Billy king situation and turning it into this, far outweighs JJ turning around a regular bad team. Quite a few teams were in a similar situation as The Sun. Very few were in Marks situation at all  When marks became GM full time, we won only one game more than the 19 win Suns you keep referring to and you won 34 games last season.."
PG: James Harden   SG: Jrue Holiday   SF: Joe Harris   PF: Justin Holiday   C: Jaxon Hayes
"&gt;Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.  Ok, those people don’t speak for me.  &gt;And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.  You haven’t had “many games” with zero stars on the court. That’s just a blatant lie.  &gt;Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.   I’m not a hater at all. I actually really want you guys to win since Harden is one of my favourite players of all time. It would physically pain me to see him retire without a ring. I’m also perfectly fine with him doing it on a superteam considering he got cock blocked by a different superteam multiple times.  I’m fine with superteams. I just don’t think building a superteam makes Marks the best executive in the league. It just means 3 guys wanted to play together. Just because I don’t agree that Marks is the outright best executive in the league that doesn’t make me a hater.   &gt;If you’re not gonna give credit for marks finding and developing Tyler Johnson, shamet, Bruce brown, claxton, Jeff green, who have been all key players for us you’re just a hater. Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped.  I have no idea why you keep bringing up the Warriors when I’ve literally never mentioned them.   I have given him credit for those moves. However, those moves specifically are not sufficient enough to declare him the best executive in the league. Drafting some decent role players doesn’t make him the best executive in the league. Denver is out here drafting Jokic in the second round and MPJ at pick 14. That’s not even mentioning Murray and Beasley.   Then you have the Raptors with Siakam (27th pick), OG (23rd pick), Norm (second round), FVV (undrafted).  Then you have the Heat who drafted a bonafide all star in Bam (pick 14), Herro, Robinson etc.  Sorry for thinking Marks is “only” a top 5-10 executive. Guess that makes me a hater lol"
"I’m saying on paper our roster shouldn’t be good when we don’t have 2 of our stars on the court. But because marks has consistently provided diamonds in the rough we have been good even with just one star on the floor.   Again before the season if you asked who’s a better supporting cast, draymond green, Andrew Wiggins, Kelly oubre, James wiseman, kevon looney or joe Harris, claxton, shamet, Jeff green, and Bruce brown everyone would say the warriors. Nobody thought any of those guys would be good outside of joe Harris.   And again it’s not like we’ve just been doing ok all year, we’re the #1 seed right now. We’ve also had plenty of games where we’ve had zero stars on the court which are just scheduled losses.   Just seems like you’re a hater by your last comment about the big 3 joining.

Look at the difference between what marks has done on the fringes and golden state who are similarly tax strapped."
"How about shamet, Bruce brown, claxton , Jeff green, Tyler Johnson ? Marks got all these guys for virtually nothing and they’ve all been exceptionally good for us.   EOTY is always a bit of a lifetime achievement award. How about developing levert,Allen, joe Harris, dlo, dinwiddie?  Like we haven’t had our stars together for most of the year. Look who was on the court yesterday for us. We’ve been picking up wins all year with our top guys out. When you’re as top heavy as us and you’re missing guys you usually end up sucking but we’ve still been exceptionally good."
"You wouldn’t trade Joe Harris for a top 3 defender in the league, when one of your teams main issues is defending?"
The Nets literally have 2 Teams than can compete  KD-Kyrie-Joe Harris-Blake-Mike James  Harden - Shooting Scrub 1 - Shooting Scrub 2 - Tall Scrub 1 - Tall Scrub 2
You’re a warriors fan? No way joe Harris is close to klays level or near
Joe Harris is getting closer and closer to Klay's level
Our strategy in beating bucks is having our big 3 plus Joe Harris rain threes
Joe Harris
"double harden at half court and leave joe harris wide open, idk about that one"
"How are you going to guard him when he's playing with prime Durant, prime Kyrie, and and a atg shooter in Joe Harris. And in this defensive environment? It's impossible."
"2016 Warriors get smashed by these Nets but KD Warriors would win easily. We had an elite defense. Klay + KD + Green + Curry + Iguodala would torch Nets on offense while providing pretty difficult defense. We grind them out over time. Also, we have a healthier KD in his prime playing better defense than current KD.  Nets are assembled without the same cohesion. It feels like Harden/KD/Kyrie + Joe Harris and friends, rather than an actual team. KD Warriors were a well-oiled buzz saw that should have won 3 in a row if not for injuries."
"“Harden drives, he kicks it to the corner to Kevin Durant, the defense doubles KD, KD kicks it to Joe Harris, Joe Harris is picked up! Joe kicks it to Kyrie for a 3!”  Defense: Fuck this shit"
\* and Joe Harris \*
Joe Harris is more than just a shooter
Joe Harris is hax. Report him for aimbot.
"Nice passing between the big 3, for a sweet Joe Harris 3."
When is Joe Harris going to show up? /s
"IMO, I don't think there's any way you put one of the best shooters in the league on the bench at the start of the game. I could maybe see putting Joe Harris in that situation, but even I think at some point you just put your best lineup out for as long as you can.   Plus I don't think there's anyone alive that could go up to James Harden's and tell him with a straight face that he's going to come off the bench. haha"
"Lol what is this ridiculous comment?  Steph got to the playoffs with his best offensive teammate being Andrew Wiggins. Once Wiseman went down the Warriors had no right making the playoffs  Yet here you are bragging about Harden elevating a roster made up of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris and generally a much stronger bench than what the Warriors are supporting Steph with  And some people think I'm too harsh when I say this subreddit has to have the lowest sports IQ of any subreddit on this site. This shit you said is just ignorant garbage"
Do nets fans feel any connection to any of these players except maybe Joe harris?
FYM? Joe Harris and James Harden play with our second unit. Harden is basically the captain of it.
You don’t know Joe Harris or Shamet?
God I love Joe Harris. Man just generally does something good when he gets the ball.
"No BS. Harden, Kyrie, Durant, Blake Griffin &amp; Joe Harris is the greatest starting five I’ve ever seen. Jesus fuck this will take a miracle."
"Bad defense, Kyrie was off, and Joe Harris couldn’t buy a bucket"
"Yeah, maybe we can give them Giannis for Jeff Green so that it's not such a ""tough tough road"" for the Nets. And Holiday for Joe Harris if you still think KD's road is so tough."
Joe Harris got benched  UPDATE: Apparently lineup was wrong. Harris is still starting
lakers need joe harris &amp; duncan robinson
"Knicks are dumb if they max Randle. Best move would be trading him for a haul.   You might even be able to get a guy like Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neal or Joe Ingles. Could call the Kings about Harrison Barnes and Bagley or Hield. Ask Detroit for Jerami Grant? Try to swap him out for Wiggins &amp; FRP? Lauri and Young? Deni and Bertans? Robinson/Herro and Oladipo? Collins and Reddish? Joe Harris and Green/Brown? Hardaway &amp; Kleber or Richardson and DFS? RoCo/DJJ &amp; Powell? White and Walker? Poku and Dort?  Hayward + PJW for Randle &amp; Bullock?  Turner + Warren for Randle and Knox?  Randle + FRP for Tobias?  Randle, Quickley and Robinson + FRPs for George, Bev Oturu?"
"Nets are not stopping Embiid so it will be mostly a shoot out. I trust the KD, Harden, Kyrie, and Joe Harris shooting."
Joe Harris is George Lincoln Rockwell then
Joe Harris might shoot 60% if Bryn Forbes is guarding him.
"I’m not rooting for an injury to be absolutely clear, but that’s also a very real possibility for this Nets team of pretty much any player in their starting 5 except for Joe Harris and maybe Kyrie."
"The transitive property is not how basketball works. It is also ""perfectly reasonable"" to assume the Nets will come up with more focus and intensity than they have sleepwalking through a couple of these Celtics games so far. Celtics series is also basically the first time in months those 3 have all played together. Dont buy at all the Bucks are some amazing matchup for the Nets either, team that allows a million 3s and doesnt have great matchups for Durant Kyrie AND Harden is not in a position to matchup great with the Nets. Budenholzer playing the 3 point variance game vs a team with Joe Harris/Durant/Kyrie/Harden, not so ideal."
I think he can guard Joe Harris just fine. As long as he's not lazy running around screens
"Nets still but probably in 6. The only reason we won is because everyone besides Harden and KD sucked tbh. Don’t expect, but do hope, Kyrie continues to suck like he did for us in the playoffs. Joe Harris probably isn’t gonna be throwing too many more airballs either"
"“Peak efficiency”  Reading comprehension.  And sure, post-Achilles Klay might just be a glorified Joe Harris. But that’s besides the point. Acting like Wiggins right now is almost as good as peak Klay is just disrespect. Klay in his prime could drop 60 points off of 11 dribbles and shoot his team to a victory in the WCF. He was literally an All-NBA and All-NBA Defensive team selection"
"It’s a series for sure. If you can stop/ LIMIT one of the nets big 3 you have a recipe for success. Boston did it (by accident probably). Harden had  41 Durant had 39 and it didn’t matter because kyrie shot poorly and only had 16. Still it took Tatum getting 50 and smart hitting 5 3s to only win by 6, but I imagine Milwaukee can give you more consistency from more guys.   Holiday giannis and Middleton are all good defenders and can guard Durant kyrie and harden. When I say guard I mean give them more difficulty than the average defender which can give them an edge. Just don’t let joe Harris and Blake beat you"
"we were looking good, the green injury and Aldrige retirement hurt a lot. We were weak up front and got crushed with those two. Honestly losing Joe harris would've been less devastating than losing green. We just have nobody who can replicate what he does for us while for harris Johnson/shamet can do 80% of what he does."
id actually rather lose joe harris than him. harris we can somewhat replace with shamet schematically. theres nobody who can do what green does for us except durant but he cant play 48 mins and we need two of those guys on the floor in crunch time.
Who guards Durant? Who guards Harden? Kyrie? Joe Harris?   The Nets will happily let you post up Brook Lopez every game if y’all want
"Don't worry, they have Joe Harris."
Joe Harris had some horrific misses in the fourth when they desperately needed his shooting. Like I mean he was straight up missing the rim on some of the tries when wide open. Idk if it’s mental or what but dude needs to figure out his shooting.
He’s a role player and your star player was absolutely awful what do you want from him. He’s at least getting joe Harris/Bertans type contract
Yes but Harden and Irvin can hit from anywhere   Joe Harris ALREADY opens up so much space too…
nah I think Joe harris is pretty clearly the 4th best player
just cause joe harris came out hot which jaylen brown on the floor could’ve prevented doubles early on
"In general you should as an NBA defense limit the possessions of high risk players and as much as you can force your rivals into more possession of low risk players.  What I measure risk with is TS%, FTr (Free throw rate) and Turnover:assist rate. In general you are better off someone with 62% TS% to not to be the one trying to score, and you're better off with someone who is 50 TS% doing so. In Ayton's case he's currently on 80 TS%. That's just unacceptable on his volume. You can't let someone nail you for 20 points on 80 TS%, it's too much.  This is like saying ""Just leave Joe Harris wide open, but don't let Harden get his shots up."" - Leaving him wide open is not an option because a wide open Harris &gt; any NBA offense ever.   The Lakers still need to account for Ayton, you can just let him have 10 dunks/layups a game when he's such a good finisher around the rim.   For example, how well would he do if the Lakers collapse on him? Does he has the poise and vision to pass out of the double team? It's very possible the answer to that is no, at least against the Lakers swarming defense (that has been really putting the clamps on recently). Hell the Lakers are even doing great in recovering so even if he passes a non-Jokic pass there's a chance you recover."
"Pretty sure that's why we lost. Joe Harris had a terrible game, Griffin didn't do shit, and Jeff Green's presence was sorely missed."
"Joe Harris is so much better than Kennard, he’s durable and plays good defense"
"JVG actually called this out. In between all the dumbass soft calls in the last few mins, they were reviewing that out of bounds call between Joe Harris and TT it was clear as day they were committing a lot more actual fouls on each other than the actual ones called but they let them play through it but the second someone breathes on KD or even he charges at someone, it's free throws"
It actually came down to your role players were better than theirs esp on defence and rebounds. Joe Harris actual my won game 2 for them.
"Tatum certainly didn't lmao. He was nice on offense though. Don't get it twisted, Celtics role players played MUCH better than the Nets role players and that was the difference this game. TT made Claxton look like a child and Fournier outshot Joe Harris. Brown was the best role player and he bricked like 2 layups so that tells you how good they were."
"Well the bench just needs to not be a complete negative. I can't tell you how bad the role players were yesterday. Brown was missing alley oop layups, claxton couldn't finish for shit and Joe Harris shot a whopping 30% from 3 on WIDE open looks, if the role players played even at a slightly BELOW average level the Nets just win.   It is what it is though, they are young and younger players tend to underperform at away games. Hopefully they learn for next one."
"Welp... I kept saying we needed to keep our foot on the gas &amp; get this sweep to be as prepared as possible for the Bucks. Kyrie has to perform better, especially in front of this crowd who wants him to fail so badly. Claxton can't disappear like that. Joe Harris has to look like the guy who lead the league in 3pt percentage. And we need Jeff Green back. Oh, and of course Tatum's 50 burger.  Hopefully we can correct some of this for Game 4."
Jellybean Joe Harris dropped the ball tonight
"Luke Kennard is a good player and can be their version of Joe Harris, but they don't use him."
What about Joe Harris makes you think he could get a high volume of shot attempts off cuts?
"&gt;	Can we do a S&amp;T with Fournier? Not that I'd want to, he brings some solid veteran play that this team sorely needs. But wondering if its an option.  I think you can, I reckon he’s likely to get a contract similar to Joe Harris (4/75M). That being said I’m not sure who you can get on an 18m/year contract that could fit better with than a low volume shooter.  It’s the same market of players as the Hayward S&amp;T scenarios a year ago.   You’re kinda right about Kemba, but all it takes is one team wanting to rebuild or missing a piece to compete.   Not that I think Toronto would, but they could be willing to rebuild and that Kemba + picks package can look good (and getting Siakam might help a lot on the defensive end on this team). Chicago can opt to get something for Lavine if he’s had enough. Washington is another one.   Lakers could hypothetically need a scoring guard if Schroeder doesn’t resign (albeit salary cap restrictions in mind). I think even Spurs would take on his contract, as they did with DeMar, if Pop wants to keep things “competitive”.   Not that any of what I said is likely, but one way or another, I think there’s going to be a team that could use a Kemba (or his 2 year contract at least)."
give some respect to joe harris man that dude was trying his heart out for rebounds tonight
"He only has range, and tall that it’s hard to contest his shots, he’s really not the same tier with Joe Harris in terms of percentage accuracy and off ball movement catch and shoot. He’s only a spot up and trail man in transition guy"
He’s like Joe Harris but bigger
Claxton was trash and his horrible rebounding brought the Celtics back in the first round  Joe Harris went like 2 for 7 from the 3 with open looks.   truth is that everyone not named Harden and Durant just didnt show up. it happens we move on to the next
Running round like Joe Harris
Lmao yeah you can tho 😭😭 outside of joe harris who isn’t a creator there’s very little firepower and dudes like blake and green contribute little on offense while providing not the best defense either
"I don’t think their roster is shallow at all. They have great roll players  Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Nick Claxton, Blake Griffin, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet  Hard to ask for more than that"
"Hey man, he meant the big three of KD, Harden, and Joe Harris."
"ESPN: Coming up, is Joe Harris Brooklyn's most important player, Jay Williams will explain, but next how Shailene Woodley's next movie location could be the key to Aaron Rodgers' future."
Shut down Kyrie and Joe Harris while having your role players scoring 20 and your best player scoring 50. How many teams can replicate that 4 times?
"narrative really went from ""Nets are stacked, look at Joe Harris"" to ""Nets are playing 3 on 5"" in one night"
What'd Blake or Joe Harris do?
"damn.  joe ""blow"" harris"
Tatum &lt;&lt;&lt; 3 of the greatest offensive players of all time and Joe Harris wide open
"KP plays like he’s 6ft! He gets moved out of post position by guards wtf!  And he doesn’t even protect the rim!   The prospect of facing Luka makes me shake in my boots, and then you see that his star 7’3 big is basically Joe Harris."
Joe Harris lost this game for Nets
Karma for Joe Harris fouling every possession I guess
Joe Harris definitely established himself.
"one instance is claxton, he's awful defensively and he gave up like 3 possessions offensively. Joe Harris is also shooting something like 27% from 3 this game lol"
Tatum has these games every couple of weeks where there is just nothing you can do to stop him  Marcus Smart and Joe Harris trading their 3 pt skills today is far more infuriating
"Blake griffin, dinwiddie, Joe Harris, shamet, Jordan, Claxton - that's a good supporting cast. But okay"
"Kemba was in a lose-lose during that Harden double.  One of either Kyrie or Joe Harris is going to get a wide open look, he can't do anything about it."
"Joe Harris, Blake and DAJ on a veteran deal if need be plus claxton.   Jeff green is also a good rotational piece.  Meth curry, Brown and shamet are nothing special though."
"Joe Harris chocking hard to remind people the NBA is a star-driven league for a reason. There's no big-4. If you could count on Harris to always make them he'd be a superstar, not a sharpshooter.  On the other hand, you  knew you can't count the Nets out because Harden is a superstar. KD is a superstar. Kyrie is a superstar (or just on the edge). So you know they WILL make shots no matter what."
Joe Harris only had 1 good game. Not a threat at all just like herro
New game plan leave Joe Harris wide open I guess
Joe Harris isn’t even hitting rim on these shots
joe harris has to be missing an eye or something
"Honestly despite the absurd star power, Joe Harris is the most important player on this Nets team. If he's not hitting his open shots, they struggle hard."
What’s going on with Joe Harris?
Celtics fans really conflicted when classy gym rat Joe Harris scores
Lmao the Gardens got Joe Harris shooting airballs
People tryin to tell me joe harris a cheat code but have you heard of marcus smart? lmao
Marcus Smart showing Joe Harris how it’s done
choose one to leave open:  Kyrie  Harden  KD  Joe Harris  double teams are literally impossible against the nets
Let’s see another Joe Harris 3 fuckin Net$$$ baby
"“Tatum is the third best player on the floor right now (KD, Joe Harris)”  Tried to just slip this in there didn’t ya"
Celtics need to take their man and live with the outcome.  Doubling Kai and leaving Joe harris in the corner is just asking for a beating
Joe Harris needs to calm down a little
Fuck Joe Harris  All My Homies Hate Joe Harris
Why is joe Harris pushing Langford like that?
Joe Harris fucking truck sticked Langford and there was no call lmao. Nets ain’t shit without the refs
What about Joe Harris?
"We don't get KD/Kyrie without being a playoff team and we got to be a playoff team without any 1sts.  We found claxton in the 2nd round, joe harris no one wanted, uncle jeff no one wanted, harden no one wanted to trade their future including the Cs.  I could go on and on, but I don't disagree being in BK helped, but he still turned a shit situation that he inherited (no draft picks) into what we have now plus the depth that everyone thought we lost."
"/r/nba KD haters malding right now  Side note: wtf happened to Joe Harris? I feel dumb saying you can’t rely on him going 1-11, 1-7 from 3 yet here we are again lol."
"I dont understand why Giannis doesn't just back down his defenders and have his way with them. He's way more gifted to be settling for 3s and jumpers. The guy can literally out muscle the whole Nets defensive front, yet he continues to refuse to do so.  Also as good as this night was for KD, WTF is the Nets bench doing. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet HAVE to add more than a combined 14pts."
"And Joe Harris + harden went 1/15 from 3 combined, evens out and then some"
Bron would atleast step up and guard the best player on the other team. Giannis just sat in the corner guarding Joe Harris while Durant was dragging his dong across the rest of the teams face.
PJ Tucker got away with a lot of fouls last game that got KD frustrated leading to that shit game  If the defense has to rely on getting away with fouls that's bad defense  Just copy the Nets' plan of having Joe Harris stand there deterring Giannis from attacking or put an injured Harden on him forcing Giannis to take a fadeaway in the clutch   And when PJ poked Harden's eye I literally saw fans complain about soft reffing lol
Joe Harris and Harden won’t go a combined 1/15 either
About the same odds as Joe Harris and James Harden going 1/15 from 3.
"If Joe Harris went 7-for-8 from three no one bats an eye. Jeff Green does it, and everyone loses their minds."
"They made the adjustments, the nets just made in-game adjustments and the bucks coach don’t know what that means so he just stuck with the original gameplan.   Even when the nets couldn’t buy a bucket in the first quarter, I thought they were getting good looks.   Joe Harris needs to make some shots"
In clutch time it is absolutely expected for him a DPOY to take the hottest dude on the court. Or at the very least help on him and not hide on Joe Harris. For comparison sakes there’s no way in hell that Lebron is letting that happen with him on the floor come clutch time. He’s done it throughout his career and he even did it last year at the age of 35. Giannis is 26 there’s no excuse for not even trying once.
Joe Harris is in no way a 2nd option. He's there to shoot 3s. I'd expect him to start hitting them.
Forget those guys he had Joe fucking Harris and Meth Curry
anyone got a nickname for joe harris?
Joe Harris went 1-7 so it evens out I guess
"Chill, Joe Harris isn’t that good"
As he should - roast the fuck outta Giannis too. 2x-MVP and DPOY guarding Joe Harris in the corner. 🤦🏼‍♂️
DPOY guarding joe Harris in the corner while Kevin Durant setting the arena on fire
"Jeff Green was the reason this game wasn't over in the first half. We really should've been down 30 pts at halftime, even with KD balling. An absolutely clutch performance, as opposed to fucking choke artist Joe Harris"
Joe Harris is so bad this series that I don’t think the comparison between him and Duncan Robinson should ever be made again
Held Joe Harris to 5 PGs 2-11 😤 shooting get my man some help!
"Up 17, Harden 1-10, Joe Harris can't even touch the rim. Still lost by 6.  KD masterclass"
He had to keep joe harris locked up in the corner while also providing no rim protection
"Not just that.. he had Joe Harris guarding him In The paint.. and he didn’t demand the ball with an entry pass.  Inexcusable. Then you couple that with the fadeaway, bad 3 point shot, and then fumbling jrues pass....  Oh.. he also wasn’t guarding KD.  Like wtf? Yes you love his help defense but harden is playing on 1 leg and there’s no other players on the Nets attacking the rim.  Inexcusable"
"Budenholzer should bury his family. Having giannis guard Joe Harris all game, pathetic.  Hope his wife cheats on him."
What's the strategy behind putting Giannis on Joe Harris instead of KD? is PJ Tucker really that much of a better defender than him or the coaching staff was thinking Giannis would be better off as a help defender?
"Legendary performances by Durant and Jeff Green.  Game 1 was the best game ive ever seen Blake Griffin play.  Game 5 was the best game ive ever seen Jeff Green play.  Side note though, ive watched a lot of Nets this year, and this series has been 5 of the worst games Joe Harris has played. Hes been so bad at the rim and from 3. If Harris was on, these games would look very different."
If Joe Harris hits 2 threes in game 3 this is literally over
"I cannot believe the Bucks lost that. Harden is a shell of himself, Kyrie is out, and Joe Harris forgot how to shoot yet you lose a 17 pt lead in the 3rd quarter. Take Bud out to the back and put him out of his misery pls. Giannis having some of the lowest iq plays too."
Joe Harris needs to do something. At this point I'd be happy if he went to an African witch doctor to improve his playoff performance.
"Man, I can't for the life of me figure out why the Bucks game-plan wasn't to attack Harden EVERY SINGLE PLAY. Holiday went after him a few times and had success, Pat beat him off the screen the one time, but that was the extent of it. They should have been hunting the switch onto Harden every single possession. Also Joe Harris should not be starting at this point, put Shamet in there instead. Harris has been such a net negative every fucking game this series, just roll with Harden, Shamet, KD, Blake and Green, rotate in Brown Harris and Claxton"
Giannis really decided to stand in the corner and guard Landry Shamet and Joe Harris instead of KD
More like 3v5 lmao Joe Harris and Harden were shooting bricks
He was out there as another ball handler to take pressure off of KD. I feel like they didn’t double KD all game because they had to have someone on Harden. His presence probably made a lot of players play better (except fucking Joe Harris).
Giannis was guarding Joe Harris in the clutch he’s 100% a part of this
Attack harden. Double Durant and let harden or joe Harris shoot. Joe has been cold for a couple of games now. Get more than 18 assists. Have Giannis defend Durant.
Yeah but Joe Harris is absolute ass.
Did uncle Jeff absorbed Joe Harris shooting?
"Hey man, he locked Joe Harris down.  Great strategy."
"I mean Bud's not a bad coach, but he's getting fired. The Bucks could use a new voice that focuses on different things than Bud.    Like there's just such little basketball IQ shown; it seems if they call a play, they ain't deviating from that play. Joe Harris on Giannis in the paint with no big near to help? Na, I called a play for Jrue. The shot selection's another thing, but I mean if they could improvise when needed, Giannis 3s wouldn't be a problem."
Our NBA Defensive MVP and 1st team All NBA defender was guarding Joe Harris and Jeff Green as KD almost dropped 50.  I just don’t get it.
Snake had a good game. Not sure what the bucks were doing. Giannis was feasting on Jeff Green everytime they were matched up on the block. They should've tried to look for that more and also attack the mismatch whenever Joe harris was on him. Instead Middleton and Jrue thinks they are Snake and takes iso contested jumpers over and over again. Giannis also played not great down the stretch.
Jeff Green and Joe Harris combined were average
Joe Harris lol
"Sleeping on nets superstar Joe Harris, who needs giannis to defend him"
Jeff Greens 7/8 from 3 made up for the Joe Harris no show.
I mean Giannis locked down Joe Harris that's all you could ask for in a Dpoy
6 v 4. Can't forget about Joe Harris switching teams.
I wonder if Joe Harris will remember how to shoot.
Have Giannis guard Durant instead of Joe Harris
"He's had some incredible games in his career, but this has to be at the very top. Kyrie out, Harden out of sorts, Joe Harris playing for the other team, Jesus, absolutely monstrous performance from KD."
No excuses.  He took the Butler matchup but is that cause Butler doesn't shoot threes.  He's hiding on Joe Harris in the corner like he's some defensive liability while poor Kris Middleton who is 3 inches shorter gets scorched in isos.
"Giannis guarding the star of the nets, joe harris"
"MVP goes to Jeff ""Joe Harris"" Green"
"Some of it is on the players too though.   Jrue had KD in ISO while Giannis had Joe Harris in the post. Jrue decides to ISO.  Doesn't matter what the coach is saying, at some point the players have to recognise the moment."
giannis first team all d sitting on joe harris in the corner while KD lighting it up. interesting
Did he guard anyone but joe Harris (who didn’t touch the ball) in that 2nd half?
Bc Coach Bud wants him to stand in the corner and guard Joe Harris
"I commented that it's a joke that Giannis is guarding Harris when Durant is on the floor and some clown had the balls to respond that Joe Harris shoots 53% on open threes.  Yea never mind the 7 footer getting 50 points on the other team destroying people a foot shorter than him.  But hey, Joe Harris shoots 53% on open threes am I right?  Also Bucks half court offense is Tier 30.  Wtf is that abomination lmao"
Joe Harris has been terrible these last 3 games.
Giannis needs to grow a spine and ignore Bud's plan to have Middleton on KD. You're the former DPOY wasting time on Shamet/Joe Harris in the corner the whole 4th in a must-win when KD is dropping 40+.   AND YOU'RE SETTLING FOR FADEAWAYS ON HARDEN WHEN JRUE IS ATTACKING HIM???
"The Bucks shot 43% from three (before the late misses), 50% from the field and had a 17-point lead almost mid-way through the 3^rd quarter against a Nets team composed of no Kyrie, a neutered version of Harden and a 2-11 Joe Harris **and still lost**.  Credit should certainly be extended to Durant for his 49/10/17 performance along with Jeff Green's best impression of Steph Curry going 7/8 from three, but this game primarily served as a living indictment against Coach Budenholzer and as others have already said -- even if the Bucks were to win a championship this year, he should still be fired."
"Harden can barely move, Kyrie is out, Joe Harris forgot how to shoot and they can't close up 17   Another masterpiece by Bud. Refuses to double KD or attack Harden defensively, doesn't play Giannis at C and continues to play Lopez in drop coverage where he gets cooked, no movement offensively in the half court."
KD drops 49 on undersized players while the “Greek freak” guards Joe Harris?????
Joe harris doesn't even belong on the court
"After the Bucks get sent home, at least he can say he locked down Joe Harris"
Giannis’ DPOY awards are so bad. KD has 46 and he’s standing in the corner guarding joe harris
The Nets should trade Joe Harris for someone who is actually useful in the playoffs
Bruh have you seen Joe Harris?
imagine guarding joe harris when kevin durant is on the floor. could not be bud
Giannis is a pussy for staying on Joe Harris/Shamet while KD is putting his slender foot up the Bucks' ass
Giannis camping on ice cold joe Harris in the corner as KD goes off all game 😂😂😂
His individual D right now is very good. He’s absolutely locking down Joe Harris in the corner
I told you Joe Harris is the worst player on the Nets yet Nash keep playing him. Nash is as bad as Bud
"IF anyone other than James Harden or Joe Harris on the Nets shoots it, they're pretty much making it tonight. KD has been unreal."
Joe Harris is absolute TRASH
Giannis guarding superstar Joe Harris instead of KD. Makes sense.
Glad Bud has Giannis marking Joe Harris and Shamet
I mean he does have a DPOY who has been sitting in the corner on Joe Harris and Landry Shamet all game
Giannis guarding Joe Harris. I dont get it
He had Joe Harris on him earlier too
"What's weirder from this game:  a) Old Jeff Green going for a career playoff high in his second game back from injury  b) Last year's DPOY who is affectionately nicknamed ""freak"" standing in the corner guarding Joe Harris or Landry Shamet in the biggest game of the season whilst Kevin Durant lights his team up"
DPOY guarding Joe Harris in crunch time
Why is Giannis guarding Shamet and Joe Harris instead of KD?
DPOY and guarding Joe Harris
And Giannis had Joe Harris on him and he cleared out so Jrue could iso..so hard to watch
Nets players points total/shooting %  Jeff Green 24 points - 7/9 shooting   Blake Griffin 17 points - 7/11 shooting  Landry Shamet 7 points - 3/5 shooting   Joe Harris **5 points - 2/11 shooting**  **James Harden 3 points - 1/10 shooting**   Bruce Brown 2 points - **1/5 shooting**  KD almost has half of his teams points lmaoooooo
"Bucks bigs refusing to do ANYTHING against smaller nets players, it’s so frustrating to watch..Giannis had Joe Harris on him and cleared out so Jrue could iso on KD.."
Giannis with Joe Harris on him and instead Jrue Holiday with a terrible iso shot over Durant. Bucks are fucked man.
Lol the 6-11 former DPOY of the year is hiding on Joe Harris
Lol. Giannis getting boxed out by Joe Harris
"Even though Harden hasn't done much, just being on the court is giving KD a lot of confidence..... that his second best player isn't Joe Harris"
giannis is being guarded by joe harris and jrue is iso'ing lmfao bro
Joe Harris on Giannis and you choose for jrue to iso durant
"Joe Harris and James Harden are 3-21 and the Nets might really win this, it’s wild"
"Joe Harris is just a poor man's Bryn Forbes, dude is honestly like 13th man on the bench material."
The trick is to not play Joe Harris.
"nets look a lot better without joe harris, who would have thought"
Joe Harris would never...
Lol Joe Harris booty
"Harden is w.e because he's obviously hurt. Win or lose though, joe harris has gotta do some soul searching after this game. He has been an utter embarrassment on both ends on the court. It's sad for me to say this because he's the longest tenured guy and has been my favorite player on the team. But this is disgraceful"
Harris still provides spacing with just his presence.    Ben also makes a max contract.  The expectations for Joe Harris and Ben Simmons are quite different lmao.
Why would the Sixers want Joe Harris?
Joe Harris is dogwater in the playoffs and is NOT a better shooter than Seth
"Randle, Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, the entire lakers team as a whole, Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons"
"Yeah fair, there were a couple wide open misses that kept making me think of Joe Harris last series lmao"
Hell yeah he locked Joe Harris tf up 😤💪💪
Bogdanivic worse than joe Harris
Joe Harris 🤝  Bogdan Bogdanovic
is bogdonavic going to get the joe harris treatment? he's been trash despite injury.
"There has also been a lot of dreadful bricking of open shots by normally competent shooters.   No, I’m not still bitter about Joe Harris."
"Perfect:   Whoever we draft becomes a possible franchise cornerstone and wins ROY. Love accepts his role as a mentor, has a healthy season, his name is tossed around for 6th MOY, is at his best place mentally.  Okuro develops a decent jump shot, improves, either dean wade or windler become the next joe Harris, sexton or garland make ""the jump"", named all star, (like young/Lillard/Booker status ) lead cavs to a 6th seed and we lose in the second round against eventual NBA champs, the nets.   Realistic: our 3rd pick averages 11.9 ppg on &lt;40 Fg%, Sexton and garland both slightly improve but it's still unclear which one we build around (both?) and how green/suggs all fit in with the guard rotation. We pay Allen 4/86 with 4th yr player option. Media focuses on sexton's contract situation all year and it's not resolved. Love plays 60 games, averages 12/6.   Worst: Cavs overpay on sexton and Allen, giving them 30+ mil/yr contracts, draft suggs who is a defensive sieve and looks awful, Kevin Porter Jr wins MIP, averages 22/3/5. Love plays 40-55 games averages 7.8ppg."
Khris “Joe Harris” Middeton
Bucks need Middleton to wake up. This is nearing joe Harris levels of ice cold
Better than offering Simmons lmao. His trade value is lower than Joe Harris.
"One point that I think goes unsaid in these discussions is: Say said superstar is back, and puts up ""x"" shots, then who from his team goes down ""x"" shots? On the nets, Joe Harris gets barely any shots now when two of the big three play. On the clippers isn't kawaii going to take away some Kennard's clutch shot opportunities this series? You can't only look at the points one player adds without considering the points others add when taking those shots instead."
Steve kerr probably turns into joe harris once he sees the firepower on the opposing end. It happened to omri casspi.
"So if Giannis isnt beating the best team in the league, why should this title be a huge bumb on his legacy? Are we really that daft as to completely ignore the context of championship runs? A title is a title, but you dont get extra legacy points for beating Joe Harris and Laundry Shamet"
Not gonna watch this til episode 2 drops.. the one where Joe Harris breaks down the Nets series. I prefer to binge my shows
"yea I don't think they need current JJ cause he's washed  but if they didn't have Joe Harris, they absolutely would want prime JJ Redick. An elite spacer like Harris next to the 3 stars was just a cheat code in the regular season.   He choked hard in the playoffs, but having a guy like that to kick out to when you're doubled is just crazy."
Who would they have even played besides Joe Harris?
Replace joe Harris with an older joe harris
Call it lack of adjustments but who tf else were they supposed to play? Joe Harris was either gonna make shots and win them the series or go down swinging. They weren’t going anywhere without him playing well.
hahahaha check out Joe Harris up there Nets fans
"No it wouldn't, it would just force mid level guys to take the minimum instead. The Nets would spend 90% of their cap space on the 3 stars and then use the 10% for role players instead of paying guys like Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan  If given the choice between paying stars and role players, NBA teams will always pay stars"
"2018? Do you mean the World Cup in 2019? That team had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee getting minutes. Taking out Kevin Love, everyone else on the Olympic team is an All-Star caliber player at minimum."
"&gt;Dame is out. Enjoy watching Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown the next 2 seasons  I agree"
"Lmao this roster is night and day from the 2019 roster! That roster featured a bunch of role players and borderline all-stars. They only had two real “stars” with Tatum and Mitchell. This year they are already led by Durant and Lillard, then Beal/Tatum/Booker as clear stars, and finally the rest of the guys are at least borderline all-star players. Definitely not the strongest team fielded but way stronger than whatever the hell it was they put together in 2019. I mean that team had Marcus Smart, Brooke Lopez, Joe Harris, and fucking Mason Plumlee! I don’t know how you could even compare this year’s roster to that other team."
5 joe Harris
"Nash hired Mike D'Antoni and Ime Udoka, so that worked out pretty well, but lack of adjustments were critical like playing an ice cold Joe Harris for 40 mins"
"I always raise an eyebrow when he launches a 3. It looks so unnatural. But hey, he shot it better than joe Harris during the nets series."
"Yeah. You know who else was shooting good all season? Joe Harris. And he also absolutely slayed earlier in the playoffs.   Jeff Green was clearly rusty and injured. And after watching Shamet all season, I think I’d still take an ice cold Joe Harris over whatever random version of Shamet shows up.   Bottom line. Nash did the best he could with the pieces he had."
I mean y’all are going to talk shit about Giannis’s 3’s but let’s look at the math shall we:  Giannis 3 point shooting percentage last series&gt; joe Harris 3 point shooting percentage last series  Joe Harris = best nba 3 point shooter this year   Communicative property:  Giannis = new best nba 3 point shooter this year  YOU CANT ARGUE THE MATH
"i'll give him that joe harris does set good screens, but this is not like kevin durant or harden or someone who you can say ""well even if KD missed the shot it was our best chance we went with our best guy"".   it's joe harris and he really seemed to have lost all shooting touch and confidence by at least game 3 in the series  it was just frustrating to watch because shamet had been playing better than harris for most of the series and barely saw the floor when it mattered most"
"and doesnt play ice cold joe fucking harris 40 minutes in a damn elimination game  swear to god every 5 minutes I was saying why is joe harris on the floor, what the fuck did landry shamet do to deserve this.  Is he injured?"
Many players are not great 3 point shooters lmao. Go ahead and check how many actually can keep shooting 3s at a good percentage in the playoffs on decent volume. It’s very few. We literally saw joe Harris disappear  And fans like good shooters over dunkers. Steph and the warriors are box office hits with or without KD
"No Dame? Gotta include Lillard on there. And Kyrie is a draw. Not sure on the level of his Nets teammates (especially Joe Harris, obvs) but people pay to see him play.  IMO you have to find space for Jayson Tatum. Love watching him play, and he's got talent and swag at such an early age.  Don't forget Zion, either. He still carries name value."
"He gonna be backup PG for the Shangai Sharks       Starting 5 of Ben Simmons, Joe Harris, Kyle Kuzma, Kristaps Porzingis, Andre Drummomd"
Joe harris did lead the league in 3 pointer but he was poor in the series against the bucks. He might just be a regular season player. The nets could try to find someone who can hit three point shots in the playoffs at a reliable rate.
Also Joe Harris
"Yeah, I do agree generally. The Bucks/Nets series were a bit of an exception, in my opinion, for this series. KD struggled passing without turnovers and really there weren't many players around him who could shoot anywhere near well enough to win it. Bruce Brown only had a floater in his bag (which the Nets did feed him), Joe Harris was *rough*, Harden couldn't hit a shot outside of one game on very limited attempts. After Game 2 the only player they had that could be a little bit consistent outside of KD was Blake Griffin - and they did give him looks.  I interpreted Pippen's comments about being the quantity of shots taken - I think every player puts up shots they probably shouldn't. I think for the series KD shooting *less* might have taken them further away from a win, even if his 30 shots involved less-than-ideal looks."
"""The reason Lebron is so good is that he spends 82 games preparing and pumping up his role players for the playoffs.""  To me you're implying that KD doesn't help his teammates get better over the span of 82 games and I bring up Joe Harris because it illustrates the point that Joe Harris was playing some of his best basketball in the regular season BECAUSE of KD. All that pumping up his role players for the playoffs and KD doesn't is just stuff you imagined, you don't know whether KD does or does not do that behind closed doors. The point is there wasn't much more KD could've done this series. Thats my original point i was trying to make. Nothing more."
"Because you're talking about how Lebron took 82 games to get role players comfortable....well in the regular season Joe Harris was THE most accurate 3 point shooter in the league largely due to the gravity of KD, Kyrie and Harden. Now Joe Harris shoots sub 30% and an abysmal % from open 3...it's KD's fault for ""not building up role player confidence""? I'm not debating that Lebron is better at helping players get better but to fault KD for this series is ridiculous."
"&gt; Joe Harris shot almost 50% from 3 in the regular season and all of a sudden it's KD's fault he chokes?  You're the one talking about Joe Harris- don't put words in my mouth just because they're easier for you to argue against.  It's not KD's *fault* that he's not as good as grooming role players for the playoffs as Lebron is, it's just a fact and why Lebron is widely considered the better player.    Joe Harris is just *one* role player of many- Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Mike James, DJ even Blake and Jeff Green at this point.  Why is it that none of them could reach the stratospheric heights of the All-NBA talents named, let me check my notes...Eddie House, Mario Chalmers, Dellavadova, and Varejao?  I hate this dumbass blame game fans like you play.  It's not KD's **fault** that he's not as good at certain aspects of leadership as Lebron, it's just a fact.  I don't hate the guy, I'm just not so far up his anus that I deny reality."
"Joe Harris shot almost 50% from 3 in the regular season and all of a sudden it's KD's fault he chokes? In fact, everyone was saying how easy of a job Joe Harris had because of the gravity KD, Kyrie and Harden demanded. Seems like goalpost moving to me."
I get that but in the situation of game 6 and 7 there was no one KD could've relied on. Some of the shots Joe Harris had...you can't get much more open than that...
"No one else is going to see this, but Joe Harris ended the season at 77.8% FT shooting, so that's pretty awesome"
"This is the 2nd reply to specifically single out only this part of my comment, it feels like politics where the politicians pick the smallest snippet of an overall quote and make their entire argument over that without taking the rest of the context.  So on that note, let me take that part out and say for the record that KD was being mostly guarded by Brook Lopez. Do you still agree with the rest of my previous comment that I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, and Blake Griffin to create their own shot against the rest of the Bucks? Given the situation, dropping 49 and 48 while playing the entire game is still a great game  KD is not a playmaker, so if that's the point you're trying to make, yes I agree with you. He's a pure scorer and a really really good one at that. He did a great job given the entire Nets situation, and I'm thankful for it as a Nets fan. The guy is not a perfect player in all offensive aspects but the effort was clearly there.   Things can be intersectional (for lack of a better word) and things can most definitely be situational without honing in on one specific shortcoming and then gravitating to an extreme based on that (recalling the strawman argument that politicians do). I encourage you as I did with the other reply to look at the majority of the comments and see how appreciative the fans are for Durant despite the cards the Nets were dealt with during the series"
"Literally nobody else except for Mike James can create their own shot on the Hospital-edition Nets during the Bucks series...I wouldn't trust Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Landry Shamet, Jeff Green, or Blake Griffin dribbling the ball in their hands the way shot creators would to find their shots. The fact that KD dropped 49 and 48 while playing the entire game and being the only focus on defense for Milwaukee as well as being guarded by PJ Tucker who has been regarded as ""the KD stopper"" going back years now, yeah that's insane  At least for the Jazz, an on-and-off Conley, Jordan Clarkson, Bojan Bogdanovic, and even Joe Inglés can kinda create their own shot, the other Nets played as the beneficiaries of playmakers like Harden and him being hobbled showed consequences on the court"
True but look at Joe Harris. Their fanbase is almost as bad as the lakers. I think at this point it's best he is traded to anywhere that gives the lakers the best return.  I think he has mentally disengaged from the Lakers. Even Magic had noticed it. Of course magic isnt exactly the trustworthy source but if you look at his press conferences from his rookie and sophomore year they are different than his conferences now. Hes also a lot happier when AD is not playing and even plays better (except for the suns series where he was atrocious).
"~~And if Jalyen Brown wasn't hurt maybe the Celtics would have advanced~~  The point Scottie's trying to get across is that it's KD's job as the best player on that *team* to get the *team* the win. Him and Harden can score as much as they want, and yes, they're gonna score and probably win on most cases. But you have to be smart with it. Giving KD the ball for him to work magic while a very good play becomes predictable once you do it for a few minutes, let alone a game or an entire series.   If they looked to spark other players on the team, KD probably doesn't have to play 48 minutes. Yes people miss and yes Joe Harris underperformed (don't tell me JR Backwoods Smith would be averaging 20 on 40% 3s like nothing), but the point of team ball is to get the team flowing...which they didn't."
The alternative is he passes to Joe Harris and he misses and everyone says WHY DIDNT KD TAKE THE LAST SHOT? IS HE NOT CONFIDENT IN HIS SKILLZ
Why does everyone hate Joe Harris so much? Just because he isn't that good?
"Joe Harris is a better 3 point shooter than Kyrie tho. How would a disabled Kyrie standing behind the 3 pt line be a bigger threat than a healthy, better 3 point shooting, JH?"
"I was just talking about the final play on offense. Literally just has to stand behind the 3 point line. No defense, no moving, and definitely no Joe Harris on the floor."
"Joe Harris for J-Rich.   Do it Nets, he's the missing piece in your puzzle. He boosted the defense of the Sixers and mavs so do it."
"I really dont think an average coach would have won game 7 bucks nets, he put his guys in a position to win.    That game and series was such a back and forth slugfest and in the end the bucks made it come down to a joe harris 3 pointer when he had been ice cold for the last 6 games of the series.     I don't think it's a coincidence that the nets ended up in that position and bud deserves some credit for at least influencing that situation to arise.   As much as any coach can directly impact how games play out.   Nash played this shitty joe harris 40 minutes in that game and he sucked, as far as I'm concerned that means he got outcoached  People are constantly overrating the bucks and downplay their opposition in order to discredit the guy, like people are allergic to giving him any credit.   Cause its easy karma that way."
Nets chillin they gonna get rid of Joe Harris and get proper 3 and D players.     Next season the biggest threats to the Nets will be the Clippers
"We had no one stepping up the last two games. Even in his masterpiece of game 5, he was throwing passes to Jeff Green and setting up Joe Harris with easy inside layups. And even then he had to pop off for 49 points lol"
"I rather KD take a shot doubleteamed, then Joe Harris shoot a wide open 3 tbh."
Jaylen Brown is severely underpaid. I’m thinking a Bertrans/Joe Harris type contract.
He did. Multiple times. Joe Harris missed multiple wide open 3s. He literally had the opportunity late in the 4th quarter of game 7 and missed.   The fuck you on about? Watch the games instead of just commenting on them.
"Reassess what? Passing it to an open Joe Harris for him to brick another 3? I much rather have KD playing hero ball. Jeff Green, Kyrie, Harden were all hurt. Is KD supposed to rely on Joe Harris, Landry Shamet and a washed up blake griffin?"
Kenard is what nets fans wanted joe Harris to be
I mean Scottie's point wasn't that great for this situation. Everyone on the Nets sucked ass offensively in game 6 and 7 besides KD....who was KD supposed to pass it to? Joe Harris? Who's shooting in the high 20s% from 3?
Okay but that's not what happened in Game 7 against the Bucks. Joe Harris had a ton of open shots in rhythm and just bricked them. Bruce Brown made his usual great cuts to the basket and was missing layups.
"How could have kd played smarter, Joe harris wasnt hitting anything, Harden was 50% at beat and wasnt willing to drive, his side kick that series was blake griffin/bruce brown... I dont see how he could have possibly played it better"
He was moving just fine enough to brick every shot alongside construction worker Joe Harris in the series
"Don't worry about it Scottie said trust your teammates, I mean Joe Harris was the league's top 3p shooter right? ...Right?"
I've always been curious to hear r/gonewild's opinion on whether Joe Harris is better than Klay Thompson
joe harris was never a legit contirbutor at any point
A response like this sums up this subs shit reactionary takes. Let's forget everything Joe Harris has ever shown just because he had a bad month. While ignoring how terrible Reddish has looked for two years.
"And it’s almost like with the way KD was playing and the way Joe Harris was playing, maybe a contested long two from the king of contested long 2s was actually the right choice."
Can't be worse than your starting SF Joe Harris
You mean like when he passes it Joe Harris with nobody in his face a couple minutes earlier and he bricked it lol.
LeBron sets up a great shot for his teammates. KD would just pass it to Joe Harris with a guy in his face and expect him to create a shot lol. If your gonna take the shot at least take a decent shot instead of a 180° contested long 2.
LeBron would’ve kicked it to big Joe Harris and he would’ve iced the game !
"3 point shooting Luka was slightly better this year on higher volume. Last year Trae was much better than Luka at a slightly higher volume.   Luka's playstyle resembles Harden, but his FT shooting more resembles Lebron's, or Joe Harris (not sure why Joe's FT % seems somewhat inconsistent from year to year). Weird player. Trae's shooting percentages more closely track the ""norm"" you would expect. Figure it must be mental because he makes crazy mid range shots from around the FT line in game all the time."
"You're missing the point of an on ball screen is supposed to do which is weird because you watch Trae.   How do you defend Kevin Durant, Harden or Kyrie in this scenario if Joe Harris sets a screen for him with at the top of the key?   If you bring the big up hard the ball handler will get to turn the corner hard or split the double and find a shot for themselves or others. All 3 can do that  If you drop into the paint or go under you they're walking into to open jumpers. All 3 can do that  Bring the weak side help over early and it's just penetrate and find the weak side shooter.    So when you exhaust all the basic coverage your  only options, which you see the Bucks went to, is to switch or blitz the ball handler.  Now how do you think that would work out with Trae? Kd and harden wouldn't even notice him.     The Nets are different because at full health they have 3 elite offensive players  These other teams have zero or one.   In basketball defense you have to concede something unless you have prime KG. The hawks aren't being forced to concede anything. The Bucks especially because Bud is terrible.  All their offensive system is to space the floor and let Giannis go to work in iso. They aren't moving, they aren't challenging the defensive integrity except at the rim and the hawks know they can't do shit about that except contest and hope for the best."
No he can’t play defense and if joe Harris has shown anything don’t draft one trick pony’s in the lottery
Ugh how about you guys take cavs legend joe Harris instead… maybe sprinkle in some REGGIE… Perry.
"Exactly. The Bucks defended Joe Harris poorly, but Joe 2019 Utah Jazzed it that series."
Lmao KD cant take every shot. So joe harris had to take those. If kyrie or harden were there they take those. Its pretty simple. Its like the dumb argument when cp3 and harden teamed up. People can play off ball genius. We won 65 games with the same stupid arguments and almost beat the KD warriors untill injures happened. Theres so much more in basketball than just dominating the ball. Harden is an elite playmaker who wasnt there who would have helped the role players as well.
Because he was playing like Joe Harris
"The ""1 ball on the court thing"" doesnt make any sense man lmao. It would have helped KD because guess who is taking those joe harris threes he was bricking like crazy? Kyrie and harden. KD wouldn't have been as gassed across the series. You might have been able to take 1 if they had a cold game like game 3 but that's it imo."
"While Pat shot 37.1% from 3 during the regular season, he is shooting 31.8% during the playoffs this year and was 0-3 from three before taking that shot (and finished 0-4 from three for the game).  That look should have been for the guy shooting the best for the Bucks that game: Holiday, who finished 5-12 from three. Not the guy shooting 0-3 from three (who finished 1-6 from the field). Not the guy who finished 0-9 from three (Middleton). Hell, even Forbes (45.2% regular season/39.7% playoffs, finished 1-3 from three and 2-4 from the field) or Portis (47.1% regular season/36.8% playoffs, finished 1-2 from three and 5-8 from the field) were viable options.   Pat had a bad shooting game yesterday. You need to go with the hot hand. Pat wasn't that.  You can talk about ""regular season"" or ""last game"" or ""last series"" all day, but many times, that doesn't translate from game to game or series to series (see Joe Harris' shooting % or Ben Simmons' meltdown).  Good play, but ultimately, the wrong guy shot it."
"Ben Simmons for Spencer Dinwiddie (S&amp;T), Joe Harris and Claxton"
47.5% 3pt shooting Joe Harris?
"I disagree my friend. In close games a bucket is a bucket regardless of points. The psychological effect of scoring is very important. 35% chance of scoring is not good enough.   Context also matters, cause a 37% shooter is not expected to have the same chance when the shot is crucial, so the actual odds are even less. That’s why I’m crunch time the ball usually goes to elite level shooters.   For comparison. Joe Harris is a special shooter but as we all saw in crunch time the ball is heavier. The Nets designed their play for Durant who is an assassin. The play broke down and Joe missed wide open. The designed play though would not have been for Joe. Same way, the Suns design the crunch time shoots for Booker and CP3 rather than Bridges or Cam Payne"
"You just watched Joe Harris for 7 games, do you really need to ask that?"
This is great in theory but the Joe Harris' of the world show why you want your big name players taking the highest pressure shots.
Joe Harris this is for youuu
"So what? Based on your logic if you’re a good shooter you should always shoot well from 3 regardless of context and regardless of circumstance. Also it’s easy to say he has good mechanics now that hes shooting well on a different team, nobody was saying that prior to him going to GS. Truth is that shot quality matters, and Wiggins had dramatically better shot quality in GSW  Because joe Harris is a pure shooter? I just told you not all players are the same  Btw dinwidde was actually a strong shot maker in the year 2019( the only playoff team hes gotten real minutes on)  https://www.bball-index.com/spencer-dinwiddie-is-an-absolute-bargain/  He cooled down at the end of the season but then picked it right back up in the playoffs where he shot 38% on 5 threes a game"
If Joe Harris didn’t completely shit the bed Nets win in 6. Even without Harden and Irving. Durant was on one this post season. Joe Harris disappeared. Shot worse than Giannis on mostly open 3s.
Wiggins always had the mechanics.   Dinwiddie is ass from 3. Explain to me why Joe Harris is killing it from deep while Dinwiddie is bad? Harris had his best 3 ball year before Brooklyn got anyone. Weird.
I mean Joe Harris just hits like a handful of threes and they win.
Koby Altman has the market cornered on terrible trades. Joe Harris for a second and Kevin Porter Jr for literally nothing. This dude is in a league of his own
"https://hoopshype.com/2018/10/11/nba-luxury-tax/  table at the bottom, they're not repeaters (yet)  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/cap/2021/  nets are $26M over the luxury tax threshold with only 8 guys under contract (7 guaranteed, 1 is like a min so doesn't change anything), i must have done the math wrong before but just pretend they can actually get 6 more guys on the roster for a total of $4M (impossible but whatever).  that would be a $93M tax bill.  add on dinwiddie for $20M and the tax bill goes up to $248M.  the additional dollars after a point _really_ hurt.  too bad DJ is apparently unplayable and like $10M... too bad they gave joe harris such a fat contract for him to score &lt;10ppg on 35% shooting in round 2 (although _if_ the big 3 are healthy he'll probably be fine for them).  EDIT: i don't know if there will be a covid discount next year, I'm guessing there probably won't be if the team owners have to re-vote on that."
Is Pat Connaughtan the new Joe Harris?
Welcome to your Joe Harris
And then Pat air balling the wide open 3 like he is Joe Harris
Middleton giving his best Joe Harris impersonation. Respect
Is this White vs black squad lol?  Hayward was born in Indianapolis and Joe Harris Washington state
jrue holiday will burn in hell next to joe harris
The 2022 Nets are going to end up like Mr. Burn's ringer team.    James Harden: Arrested for narcotics in France  Kevin Durant: Hypnotized into believing he's a snake  Kyrie Irving: Fell off the edge of the earth  Blake Griffin: Gets into a car accident while filming a KIA commercial  Joe Harris: Refuses to shave his pubes and gets kicked off the team  DeAndre Jordan: Gets dwarfism eating a special brain and nerve pizza developed by team doctors  Jeff Green: Too buy rescuing people during a hurricane  Spencer Dinwiddie: Knocked out by local oaf over argument about who's the real NY team
"Wouldn’t the Nets have Jarrett Allen in this case? I feel like a healthy team of Kyrie, Caris Levert, Joe Harris, KD, and Jarrett Allen (or put Bruce brown as PG and let Levert play 6th man) would be able to take it, even have a guy like Jeff Green who wouldn’t have to play as major of a role on defense if Allen was there.  Dunno, i guess i might still take the Cavs in that series but it’s a little closer than i thought."
You're worse lol.  1) You got taken to 7 by KD and and Joe Harris and wouldve lost if KD played barefoot.  2) You went to a game 6 versus the baby Hawks and Trae Young.  3) You're on track to getting swept by the Suns right now lol
"Look I like Joe harris, but he can suck my dick as far as I’m concerned."
"D'Lo was an all star and lead the Brooklyn Nets to the playoffs like 2 years ago. His next best teammates were Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie. Since then, he has been traded and hurt and unable to build any stability where he has been at until the second half of this last season, where the TWolves performed kinda decently (9-7 in the last month of the season)  Cmon man"
??? Lebron is never more efficient than KD. Kd shoots more jumpers and 3s genius. And Lebron wasn't better on D just passing. Kd was about to beat the Bucks singlehandedly if Joe Harris didn't forget how to play basketball.
"So this will never happen, but I think this would actually be better for the Nets.   The nets don’t have great D. Ben can pass very well and can shore up the defense. And then for offense he can deflect to Joe Harris, KD, Kyrie. He also has help from the Claxton and Shamet.   That Nets team would be unstoppable (if everyone can stay healthy)   And Sixers get Harden"
"Kyle Kuzma got 13 yr, Joe Harris got 18, the fact that people think a 20ppg scorer is getting less than 13 himself - even post ACL tear - is not based in reality  Especially if the cap spikes like it’s predicted"
"Didn't mean to imply Bucks/Cavs playoffs.. just a lot of central division regular season matchups.  And I think you're selling KLove short defensively. I'm not talking about ""The Stop"" in the finals either... that was kind of a flukey one-off thing. I'm just talking about his overall mobility and ability to navigate the pick and roll. He's maybe not a net positive, and teams may have targeted him at times, but I don't recall him ever being exploited to the degree we've seen Brook's drop coverage (or Brook's recent switching). He took timely charges (and disrupted countless other plays by being in good position, so maybe not tallying up charges but still having an impact)  Brook is one of the slowest footed guys in the league. 3 years ago I would have called him an elite rim protector, but he has really fallen off. He still gets his blocks at times, but he is not altering nearly as many shots. Go watch the Nets series and watch how many times Joe Harris (who was ass all series) attacked Brook near the rim unphased."
JOE HARRIS LMAO GOTEM
Na he’d scare players like joe Harris into not choking in the playoffs
"Blake put up close to 20 / 10 a couple times in the Bucks series when Harden got injured and Joe Harris was playing like dogshit, he was a key starter on their team."
Joe Harris
"That’s DPOY &amp; playoff star Joe Harris to you, buddy"
Jrue Holliday shot like shit against Joe Harris
Jae Crowder with the Ariza/Joe Harris statline too
"All Joe Harris had to do was literally make one more 3 in the semi final series and the Nets would be in the Finals and have an easy path to the championship, even with all the injuries. Then CP3 will forever be ringless"
Joe Harris
"Nash did pretty well considering the big 3 hardly played together this season. He got a lot out of their role players - Bruce Brown, Claxton, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, and even Mike James looked pretty good.   And yea Stevens maybe lost the locker room a bit and maybe that's why he's stepping down so maybe he wasn't a great example."
What’s wrong with Joe Harris?
I mean its pretty much what the Nets did around Joe Harris
"If Davis Bertans is making 5/80 and Joe Harris is making 4/75, Huerter is easily making more then $15 million"
"Well unlike Joe Harris, Klay actually shows up in the postseason and he's a better defender than Duncan while being just as good if not better as a shooter"
KD plays 4 for the Nets  Joe Harris definitely doesnt lol
joe harris will burn in the deepest pits of h*ll. im sure klay will be better than that
Joe Harris and Duncan are 82 game players while Klay Thompson is built for the playoffs.  &amp;#x200B;  Both Harris and Duncan have significant drop-offs in career FG% + 3PT% when comparing Regular Season to playoffs while Klay's FG% and 3PT% in the playoffs are higher than his regular-season averages.
"Lol regardless of what you think, klay is leagues ahead of joe harris and duncan robinson"
"Where did i say he underperforms? Quote that please  I'm saying players that rely on this skillset can have very up and down performances, Klay has had that so has Harris and Robinson and many other microwave catch and shoot players   Joe Harris just went from shooting 51% from three to 32%  Klay went from 34% WCF to 58% in the finals, 51% to 27% in round one in 2018   Eventually all of that averages out to normal"
"Besides defense, he’s an even better shooter/scorer than Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson. Those last 2 are good but the issue is if they didn’t play with great players who attracted a lot of attention, they wouldn’t be that good. You can say “but Klay plays with Steph”, but even when Steph’s not on the floor, Klay can score the ball a lot better than Harris or Robinson. At the beginning of the 2nd and 4th periods with the Warriors back in the day, Klay would be out there without Steph (since Kerr staggers) and he could hold up very well as the #1 option."
"The only real difference is he’s an excellent defender and he’s proven himself in the playoffs. That being said, right now I’d rather joe Harris since my team already has one fragile motherfucker on it."
&gt;Klay has had some terrible stinker series just like Joe Harris and Robinson in the playoffs  When has Duncan Robinson had a stinker series?
"He's a better version of them because he is a better shooter and more confident  With that being said just like other players that rely on catch and shoot, Klay has had some terrible stinker series just like Joe Harris and Robinson in the playoffs  Those players get defended way better in the playoffs"
At this point I’d much rather have Joe Harris
"Sorry, that's just a terminology difference then.  I use Roleplayer to describe someone who fulfills a role on a team, I would describe people like Joe Harris, PJ Tucker, Clint Capela, etc... as Roleplayers.  Yes Lopez is an important player for the bucks, but at best he's their 4th best player, and his role on the team is focused.  Going from being a top 2 player on a team, and posting large stats regularly with a bad record, to a smaller role with more focused responsibilities, on a team that has now made it to the NBA finals imo is the perfect example of an empty stats player.  Players with those stats aren't bad, but they are putting up those stats on usage rates, and with responsibilities that a winning team wouldn't be able to allow them to have."
"&gt;That said you never know what Joe Harris is getting up to.  We know he'll shoot his shot, even if the results doom his franchise."
"&gt; As for the GF, is she an escort or an escort?  Honestly I read this less in the ""they're paying for escorts"" sense than in the ""giving your side chick a job to keep her chill"" sense.   That said you never know what Joe Harris is getting up to."
"Joe Harris also played for us that series so if they can get him back on their team, that would be helpful. I’ll be interested to see how the roster fills out though, wonder how they’ll utilize a possible dinwiddie S&amp;T and maneuver guys like Blake and Green hitting FA."
"KD, Joe Harris and ~~Bruce Brown~~ James Harden on one leg is a level playing field? Damn, the rest of the league is more trash than I thought"
"KD, Joe Harris and Bruce Brown is a level playing field? Damn, the rest of the league is more trash than I thought"
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
"It's not about 3pt vs mid range. Its about spacing, timing, and shot form.  It is harder to hit a contested shot off the dribble than hit a set shot when you are passed the ball with you shoulders already square to the basket.  If you gave Joe Harris or any other 3 point shooter open mid ranges like they get the ball passed to them on the 3pt line they'd shoot way better than 50% from mid range. But there's almost no reason for the defense to ever allow a wide open mid range because it's a shorter distance to close out.  Meanwhile the shots guys like Steph, Luka, and Harden are taking off the dribble behind the 3pt line are harder to make than a contested mid range."
"Every series we've needed the other team to have their shooter just miss wide open 3s. Joe Harris, K'Von. I'm less than optimistic the Suns will miss their wide open shots."
"Could a starting 5 of Kevin Love, Gordon Heyward, Kevin Huerter, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson qualify for the olympics?"
compared to Joe Harris whose shots didnt fall at all
"&gt; Ok cool, we can agree to disagree. If next season passes and his 3ball % regresses that contract is fair to not great.   If OG regresses to the mean of 37.5% that still makes him an above average shooter and unlike Siakam who regressed from three he has shown three point ability from his rookie season which he shot 37.1%. This three point regression fear you have isn't something of concern, he isn't a Joe Harris whose only value is that. Three point shooting is a strength, a great one at that, but it isn't his most valuable aspect. Its an unfounded fear imo unlike with Siakam which was a concern I had coming into his extension.  &gt; I mean y’all were saying the same things before this year about Pascal when he shot the skin off the ball. Now, after a sub 30% season from distance his value isn’t even close to what it was and I’m damn sure he’d never be given the contract he has.   Any player who was the second option on a championship team is getting the max no matter what, and Siakam regression this season makes sense as he is a career 32.5% three pointer shooter which is why I actually was expecting some sort of regression from three though not this drastic. Even with the three point regression, Siakam is still a valuable player due to, just like OG, his being an elite defender at the wing who also defends legit 1 through 5. OG is tops in defensive versatility star and Siakam is not far behind him (94th percentile). And by shoot the skin off the ball do you mean 35.9%, just about average?  Even with the regression from three, Siakam has actually shown improvement as a defender but also as a ball handler and playmaker as well especially off a handoff coming out the corner or wing. Increased his assist numbers while keeping his turnovers stable (per100, 4.7A to 6.0, 3.3TOV to 3.1, 10.7TOV% to 10.6). Siakam is also 2nd in contested threes per game, 3rd in forced TOV% in isos, 3rd in opponent fg% from 5-9 feet (which came with him being forced to play significant minutes out of position at the 5), 4th in def loose balls recovered, 5th in iso points per possession allowed, 4th among PFs in total contested shots per game and ranked 94th percentile in defensive versatility. Bonafide elite defensive player who outside of his three point regression has taken a step forward as an offensive player.  For someone who worked for the Raptors for 17 years, calling OG heavy footed when it is actually a strength for him is odd to say the least."
"No, I said team friendly. When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M, then OG for 4 years 72M is below market value and a team friendly deal.  A player doesn't have to be top 30 to not want them to be traded outside of for a star or for a franchise to value them."
"Joe Harris is an overpay but guess what? It is those types of overpays that are then used to negotiate larger deals. No player or agent is going ""Joe Harris is a nuts overpay so let's not even try to ask for something in that ball park or more."" Even going back to before the extension you had people like Zach Lowe who were saying they thought OG would get closer to 90 million for four years. If Derrick White is getting 70M over 4 years, OG signing for 72M over 4 years is team friendly.  It isn't about what is ""fair"" it's about what you can demand. The Raptors lucked out by extending him before this season where he took a big jump on both ends of the floor."
So you think him at 25 is fair?  Joe Harris is a nuts overpay.
"4 Years 72 Million isn't team friendly for a player of OGs caliber to you? When Dejounte Murray is getting 4 Years 64 million, 72M for OG is a great deal for the Raptors. Derrick White got 4 Years 70M, Joe Harris for 4 years 72M. None of them offer equivalent value on the court that OG brings or as an asset so yeah, OG getting locked in at his current extension is team friendly."
"Don't have anything against my fellow Brazilians, but they haven't won any medal on WC or Olympics for 40 years. I don't see them as a basketball nation at all. Volleyball and football, huge yes.  It is strange that Serbia who played 3 finals in last 4 major competitions and won 5th on WC last time won't play.  It is strange that Greece with the best player in the world and team who was until recently the only who beat USA won't play. At Olympics which they invented.  It is strange that Canada who has most of the NBA players after Americans won't play.  And of course, it could be a national crisis for Baltic that Lithuania didn't qualify and indeed it is strange.  But that happens when FIBA makes a political war with other bodies and all the good teams who have their players in international teams cannot play for qualifications, while worse teams have their core always ready. That's how Croatia loses against Hungary, Serbia against Switzerland, Greece against Bosnia.  It is not the only problem of course, we can discuss it, but if you don't get your Visa on previous competition, your coach has so many challenges to make a team which will get it and later tell some of these guys they won't play because of the arrival of NBA players on their spot.   Also, NBA plays a big role of conditioning international players for choosing to play for National teams. But that topic can be catchy, at least you got me wrong last time. You guys from USA have a different view on our European pride and right to tell who has an obligation to play for their country. American players on the other hand, fight for their position in the team USA every 4 years because OG give them a chance to make more money. On WC and other FIBA competitions, you play with Derrick White and Joe Harris, but still find yourself woke enough to give Serbs lessons for being angry on the MVP for riding a horse while his compatriots are getting rekt by Italians who cannot miss. Cheers."
"Would like to get Ja and Zion to replace Jrue and Middleton as the up and coming talents. Maybe Joe Harris for Booker for added shooting. It'll help his confidence after the disaster Bucks series, plus he was on the losing FIBA team."
They shouldn't given him Joe Harris money to be a younger Joe Harris that plays defense?
Tbh all the nets needed was Kyrie...or Joe Harris to be Joe Harris.
I mean maybe? That’s probably Joe Harris vs Brook lopez (feel free to correct me bucks fans). Harris was bad in the second series but still shot 40% total in the playoffs iirc.
Yes correct Philly and Boston just bet on the wrong guys but in theory you are correct. As for the Nets I think if they salary dumped Harris and don’t bring back Dimwinie they still win the chip next year and would put them under the tax.   Same for the warriors if they would consolidate Wiseman + 7 + 14 and grab like Jalen Green and Suggs they could win the chip and cut their tax bill a lot.   The gist of what I’m saying is if you have 3 real stars playoff rotation players 4-7 just need to be replacement level. Like I don’t need to pay Joe Harris 18m I can swap him with Shamet and get 50% of the returns for a fraction of cost.
"So if Middleton and Holiday got hurt, how well would the Bucks do? If CP3 and Ayton got hurt, how well do the Suns do? Joe Harris became a ghost and the other players couldn’t step up. No team in the league has that much bench depth to adequately replace perennial scoring threats like that"
"Both Philly and Boston have/had a 3rd max player. Harris and walker. You can say what you will about either of them and their contacts but that's exactly what those teams did.   Paying deep into the tax is tolerable for a year or two but that repeater penalty will break up a team faster than most fans seem to acknowledge. Golden state and Brooklyn are looking at 200m in luxury tax this year. Brooklyn is looking at almost 300m next year. I think every non tax payer receives a cut of that, meaning 20-25 teams will receive 10m+ (the league gets a cut too). Would you be willing to bankroll 5-10% of nearly every other teams salary for a championship? My answer is no, but I'm not a billionaire. Also worth noting in Brooklyns case that China has been particularly aggressive in clamping down on powerful tech companies, with Ali baba (joe Tsai ceo) being fined 2.75bn only 3 months ago for antitrust violations. With that said I highly doubt they ""run it back"" 2 more times. Staying top heavy is tolerable for a year or 2, then it's not."
Yeah man. Bud kept on playing Brook Lopez despite KD is hunting him in pick and roll. And Brook didn't even get any touches in the paint even though he was guarded by joe harris sometimes. Just infuriating
No 2019 bucks aint losing to nets with kd and joe harris
"Most of these are pretty solid. I’d say Suggs is more Holiday, less shooting but more athleticism. Barnes to me is more like a bigger Draymond/rich mans Rondae Hollis Jefferson to me. Not very sold on Moody, he’s probably more like Dorian Finney-Smith. Sengun to me is more like a better passing Kanter or Boban, skilled and big post scorer but lacking in other areas very important to the NBA game. Maybe ceiling Al Jefferson. Davion is most similar to Donovan in play style. Kispert maybe more similar to Buddy Hield but Joe Harris not bad overall as a comp. Bouknight and Ellis is fine. Giddey is more of a budget Kyle Anderson"
so basically Joe Harris this year
"I looked into it. It kinda doesnt. Even Curry, who had the least amount of spacing according to bball index has 60% of his shots come from 3 pointers. Even 6 foot 1 FVV who is obviously a 3 point specialist has like 50%+ of his shots come from 3 pointers. Good 3 point shooters shoot more 3 pointesr...you see this easily looking at 3 point leaders.   Obviously there's some context needed, but it's not like we're comparing Joe Harris to Booker or Kapano to Curry  If Booker really wanted to shoot more than 5, I'm sure the Suns would scheme more 3 pointesr. The reality is that he's not an elite 3 point shooter."
"True, KAT isn’t much a dribbler as well but he can pass and read the court quite well.  Simmons was a much better defender in the regular season(IMO) than he was vs the Hawks, and I agree he got away with a lot of physicality. He was more controlled and poised than in the yoffs, he was just broke mentally it seemed unfortunately.  Hopefully Thybulle can learn to shoot better, and he’s been driving and dribbling better towards the end of the season. I agree about BKN, they’re a basketball cheat code. Even without their stars, role players like Joe Harris and Bruce Brown compliment them so well, if they stay healthy next season I don’t see how anyone can stop them.  Huerter was great the entire Sixers series, it seemed, not just that game. Does he not have the defensive and playmaking chops usually? Cuz he was making all the right plays that series, absolutely on fire"
Huh? Those Pacer/Bulls/Celtics teams had no one as good as Giannis. And them add 2 more All Star level players in their prime in Middleton and Holiday. The 2012 Celtics were close but Lebron has prime Wade and Bosh. KD had Joe Harris and 1 legged Harden.
"Also a lot of luck went into making the Finals. Nets were a healthy Harden, Irving or KD’s foot being a inch more away from the hoop from losing. One of those. Even if Joe Harris was half of as good as he was in the regular season. Bud’s coaching didn’t help either."
if kyrie/durant/harden can all play together on a team that also just gave joe harris 4/75 I'm pretty sure you can find a way to fit in young/collins/bogdanovic
"Oh snap, Giant Joe Harris and Lil Kevin Love on the same team."
"Kevin ""Joe Harris"" Huerter"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).

Lakers: LeBron, Pelicans AD, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Harrell, Wesley Matthews, Schroder, Kuzma, Suns Markieff Morris, Pistons KCP, Suns Jared Dudley, Kings Ben McLemore.  76ers: Prime Dwight, Embiid, Simmons, Tobias, Spurs Danny Green, Pacers George Hill, Milton, Warriors Anthony Tolliver.

They could have made the finals and given Harden the next series to rest had Joe Harris gone to his sports psychiatry sessions and Giannis be such a tool injuring Kyrie.
"That dude was coached by Tony Bennett and played at UVA with Brogdon, Joe Harris, and Justin Anderson.  He’s not quite NBA caliber, but he ain’t no scrub neither."
Bryn “Joe Harris” Forbes
"Hiding in the corner all game is grossly oversimplifying it. Giannis is a great help defender, he’s benefitted a lot from the scheme and personnel of the Bucks. Lopez protect the paint, Middleton plays the nail, Bledsoe contest from behind and forcing middle, Divicenzo also a good defender and plays the passing lane well too. Giannis was just a free safety using his length and speed to cover up mistake from the weak side and that weak side is typically coming off a spot up shooter in the corner.  It’s stupid that Bud did what he did vs Brooklyn leaving Giannis on Joe Harris and not have him switch on KD for different looks but Giannis defense is elite, he’s just better at help defender than man to man and fighting over screens on the perimeter"
"Not really if the Sixers can get an unprotected/lightly protected 2025 and 2027 picks plus Beasley and Rubio. They could then trade Rubio, Hill, and Shake plus this year's first for Lowry and Baynes. That gives them a solid lineup plus depth and two major assets thinking that the Wolves could implode.   Lowry/Curry/Thybulle/Harris/Embiid fits better. Plus they have a backup center and a 6th man with Beasley who can play with Embiid. Maxey off the bench too. Maybe Joe can give solid minutes or you sign some vets who can fill in the rest."
How about Joe Harris
Subpar is a nice way of saying it.. Joe Harris of course had a FG% of 37% and somehow that was higher than DLo FG%
"I wouldn’t use Lonzo as the buffer, more like Joe Harris 4 yr(s) / $75,000,000 and Kennard as mentioned above…"
Y’all are gonna wind up with Joe Harris and some crumbs
"The 2019 world cup roster:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"Joe Harris, 2021 Nets post season run"
Huerter looking like Joe Harris tonight.
Bryn Forbes is reprising the role of Joe Harris from round 2
"His supporting cast was playing like prime playoff joe Harris before tonight, bar a few good games here and there"
Joe Harris according to 538  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/
"Joe Harris, too."
About a joe harris 1-11 and 2-11 or a trevor ariza 0-12
"Kerr was a simple role player who was good at shooting, he wouldn’t become some superstar in this era. He’s literally Joe harris. He’s a solid role guy and not much else"
"Cavs (assuming peak) could be interesting  Rose/Kyrie/IT/Deron Williams  Wade/Korver  Lebron/Richard Jefferson/Joe Harris  Love  Drummond/TT   A lineup of Rose/Deron/Wade/Lebron/Love could be pretty good, though not as good OKC or Lakers or Warriors"
Middleton is better on a championship caliber team right now. Why would Bucks want to swap just for picks?  Ingram is already young and matches the window of the team with Zion and Lonzo  (Joe) Harris?  That’s interesting but I feel like CJ is actually better than Harris…
"It’s crazy how much people are in love with Steve Nash just because he’s a mild-tempered dude who was once a good player. He’s a noob coach who has proven in this season that he can’t coach. He was scared of out his mind in the Bucks series and made ZERO rotations, just left KD on the court all games long, overplaying Joe Harris hoping that they’ll somehow bail him out. No trust in his other bench players unlike Ty Lue who gave Terrance Mann a chance and got rewarded for it. At the last second of game 7 he once again froze and did nothing. Ran no offense for a superstar team. This man doesn’t deserve to get carried to a championship by his amazing team."
No one is arguing it doesn't count but looking at the Miami series the Bucks are a solid team when healthy. Nets went all in on their threes stars at the sacrifice of their defense and depth. So when 1 of the trio is out and the second is on one leg you are expected to close them out.   Hell if Joe Harris played average along with KD then Nets would have advanced
So him maybe beating this bucks team if joe Harris played better indicates he could beat a real championship contender like a healthy lakers team lol.
You obviously watched it with your eyes closed if you think his performance is not evidence sjggesting he would win with literally a slightly better Joe Harris
I’m guessing they would have kept him if they could find someone to trade Buddy Hield to. But Hield at the 24 million he made this year is practically untradeable unless you’re salary dumping him.   The extension was unfortunate. They expected him to improve more but he is already at his ceiling. Great shooter but he can’t defend or create for others. He’s a Joe Harris type player
"I love those redemption stories. Joe Harris was basically out of the league, and now he's the top 3 point shooter in the league, and Dinwiddie was in and out of the D league and won the skills competition (and is about to get paid)."
iso joe harris
Joe Harris
"True, but Tobias also shot 61.1% on open threes and THJ shot 44%. TH takes fewer attempts because he has more to offer than being a spotup shooter (THJ is a SG, TH is a PF, the discrepanvy in attempts should be expected).  My point is less that TH is a better guy to have standing around only shooting threes and more that THJ isn't quite the top-tier shooter that he gained a reputation as from the clippers series. There's some thought around here that he is equivalent to Robinson, Joe Harris, et al, which is very dubious. He wasn't exceptional in the regular season and he regressed to the mean in game 7. He isn't worth Tobias, even if he's a better fit"
"Joe Harris, not Tobias"
Joe Harris I presume. But still a better defender than everyone else on this list.
Joe Harris is passable. Much better than everyone else on this list.
"I agree, if they keep Blake, him and Joe Harris are those perfect role players to fit next to the the Nets top 3. Blake shot crazy from 3 and was super efficient in the Bucks series. There's just a lot of injury concern with their best 3 players, that's all that's holding them back and I expect that one of them will probably be out/hampered with injury in the playoffs next year. Just the way it's seemed to go with those guys"
The Nets have a deep roster beyond their stars though - they completely froze guys like Joe Harris out of the offense when they began the playoffs and finally had all of their 3 stars on the floor. That never happens if they adopt a pass-heavy/moving off ball offense similar to GSW instead of going full on iso-ball. That offensive adjustment alone would be insurance to one of their stars getting hurt.
"&gt; maybe is Jrue/Middleton show up besides the fourth the game doesn't go to OT?  And maybe Patty Mills turns into a 45pts average player on 60/50/90 for one series. I mean everything is theoretically possible, but neither player has EVER shown to have a consistent series, and in fact, almost always have more bad games than good games (and definitely a lot more than great games).   Expecting them to wildly and uncharacteristically overperform is not the same as expecting Joe Harris to make a bit more than *half* of what he makes in the regular season."
"If Joe Harris makes 2/13 instead of 1/13 it's all over lmao. Most accurate shooter in the NBA missed wide open 3 after wide open 3. It's really not like the Nets role players played the perfect game on the other end, not even close."
They only need two. Bucks were basically on the ropes with just kyrie and Durant and were joe Harris having a decent game away to losing to just Durant lmao
more casual fans know who kyle kuzma is than pj tucker or joe harris.  thats why
"As great as Giannis is he benefitted mightily from opposing injuries. The Nets, a 3PT reliant team, win the title if they were healthy. They didn’t even need to be healthy, they just needed Joe Harris to not fall apart."
"So… you would have wanted KDs insane level of play, but taken the ball out of his hands more often for a less efficient Kyrie? It’s not like KD was sitting out and you just had Shamet running to offense. The reason the nets lost was Joe Harris couldn’t make his 3s, and the nets couldn’t keep up with the rebounding."
if joe harris is anything but absolute booty cheeks in that game 7 they win that game wym
"What? They didn't lose because of joe harris, they lost because of injuries. They won 2-0 when Harris was trash."
If Joe Harris shot 0.5% better from 3 in the playoffs Nets beat Bucks and are NBA champions 😳
nt joe harris
"Nets Harden is by far a better playmaker than LeBron right now, what are you talking about? 10.8 APG on the season compared to Bron’s 7.8 is much better. I’m addition to that he’s on the court with KD and Irving, both of whom are players that will draw gravity away from Kuz leaving him open more often. Put it this way, on the Lakers, there were times where Kuz was one of only 2 elite perimeter threats, ie he was taking up a large share of the perimeter defensive attention. On the Nets, he’s going to be on a lineup of 4/5 dudes that can all shoot from the arc if he plays at the 3/4. If he starts some games (say if Joe Harris goes to the bench or if KD is on load management), he’s got a lineup of Beard, Kai, Joe/KD, himself and BG/Uncle Jeff (depends on FA outcome). That will give him so many opportunities to take under the radar 3s in a similar way to Harris, or make drives and cuts to the basket like Bruce did throughout the season.   TLDR the ball movement and lack of defensive attention on him will help him out a ton."
"Yep, get him to replace Joe Harris and upgrade the roster elsewhere."
"Joe Harris was supossed to be like the 4th guy on that team and suddenly he became the 2nd scoring option behind KD, he wasant ready for that."
Can't be worse than Joe Harris
Have you seen Joe Harris shooting against the Bucks?
Russ working double duty for KD and Harden. May as well have Beal traded to the Nets for Joe Harris to make it triple duty.
"I think he was a pretty good fit honestly. He provides some secondary ball handling and spacing. A bit too streaky but that’s fine. Looked awful defensively, but maybe he needed more time in the system. I think it was probably pretty difficult to find chemistry after a deadline acquisition and he got COVID with really bad symptoms. Still shot 46% on 6 attempts per game while he was with us.    I just don’t think the Celtics can commit to this current roster long term and expect to win so Fournier at $20M is tough to swallow. But agree with your overall assessment that $20M is not a ludicrous offer. Joe Harris got 4/$75M and Bogdan got 4/$72M so I bet Fournier thinks he deserves something in line with those contracts."
"No, they really don't. People just assume that they do, if you actually watch games you see that people like Danny Green, Pat Connaughton, KCP, Jae Crowder, Joe Harris, etc. all get played off of if they aren't actively hitting their shots."
"Shooting of course but i'm talking about truly elite shooting. There's a reason why a guy like Joe Harris got paid so well.      If he shot even remotely close to his usual averages in the losses to the bucks, the nets would be champions right now even with Kyrie and Harden out or not at full strength."
"Do people also understand that shooting percentages don't drive gravity?   If you have some guy out there that's not respected, even if he's statistically a great shooter, as soon as he misses a couple people are going to start playing off of him.   Like, AD standing at the 3 has more gravity than Joe Harris after a couple of misses. Same shit with Danny Green, KCP, etc."
All of those teams still had players you needed to respect from three. Which means they couldn’t just be helped off easily even if they were missing. Reputation matters. Rondo shot 40% during the Lakers run and was still getting left open. Joe Harris was terrible from 3 games 3-7 against the Bucks and they still closed out on him. The threat of the three is just as important to spacing if not more than the actual percentages.
I have a feeling that a healthy big 3 on the Nets will solve the Joe Harris problem
"If you're gonna trade Joe Harris, you should do it for some defense. They already have amazing floor spacers"
"&gt; The Nets' fit isn't supposed to work either.  The Nets fit works because all three of their superstars are useful off-ball players, and they have Joe Harris who is a perfect role player on a team like that. Jeff Green and Landry Shamet combined to hit 40% of almost 600 threes this season.  The Lakers have virtually no shooting, and none of their big 3 are great shooters."
No chance Joe Harris shots worse from 3 than Giannis again
He's a much better all around shooter. He has way more in his bag than Joe Harris
Joe Harris is better for his defense.
Just a few weeks ago when Nets fan were comparing Joe Harris to Klay
Joe Harris is a better player than Buddy Hield and how do we know Buddy Hield is good in the playoffs lol
"Joe Harris is better. Overreacting to a 7 game sample size because ""it's the playoffs"" when time and time again you see small playoff sample sizes are not indicative of shooting performances going forward is asinine."
His contract hurts. He’s joe Harris but is paid more than him.
All those guys are deadly shooters though and they have one role player (Joe Harris) who might be a better catch and shoot guy than all of them.  It's easier to put them together.
It sure did. And Joe Harris couldn't shoot. It's the weakest road to the finals I've seen.   I'm not saying giannis isn't an absolute force. I'm saying multiple teams have the personal to guard him.
Shooting is important but it’s not the be all end all people make it out to be. To say all those positives amount to nothing without shooting is a bit ignorant because I’d much rather have giddey and all his play making upside with a say 32% three than joe Harris
Nets have Joe Harris and Dinwiddie
"The reason nobody has ""blossomed into a star"" is because he didn't play with any besides the established ones. Or in some cases he just played with them extremely early in their career. (Like Joe Harris) It's only natural that players improve the more years they have under their belt."
Kispert is Joe Harris 2.0  Exactly what we need on our squad.
"Lakers won a ring when we were 21st in three point shooting. They didn't watch the Bucks win their ring or us when we won our ring either apparently.   Statsheet commentators ain't watching games. Lakers could have had Joe Harris last season and he would probably have shot like absolute ass like he did on the Nets because we had the same problems they did with injured cores. Without other players to soak up attention or make plays, pure shooters aren't going to be giving you the numbers you expect during the playoffs.   Lakers needed Dennis to be the playermaker, he just absolutely wasn't. Not even close."
"Booker was doubled pretty much throughout the entire playoffs and still hit threes. There’s a reason booker doesn’t get left alone at the three point line like Westbrook does. There’s more to it than just splits. Kobe, Luka, Booker, and guys like them get heat for shooting low 30% throughout their career but they have the full attention from the defense constantly, while guys like Korver, Seth Curry, and Joe Harris just get wide open spot up threes."
If the Nets are getting Kuz + Harrell for Dinwiddie why not flip them for Hield? Kuz is redundant with Jeff Green and Buddy would be a perfect 6th man/Joe Harris replacement if he struggles in the playoffs again
"Mostly because a lot of the shooters that got paid are pretty 1 dimensional, like Bertans or Hield (correct me if I'm wrong).  Same thing will probably happen once Duncan Robinson gets paid.  Also, shooting is inherently high variance.  The most inconsistent shooters get labeled streaky (like Danny Green), which give pretty clear windows to hate on someone lol (Joe Harris was facing this a bit after the Nets loss)."
"in 2019 offseason bkn had a lot of cheaper contracts because they had a lot of their own drafted guys or acquired other teams' guys on cheaper contracts.  they were able to basically sign KD and kyrie (and DJ lol) with the space they had (although part of the space came from clearing out DLo).  then the next offseason they were able to give decent raises to their own guys they had bird rights on ($13-17M range?) so they had several of those guys around.  and they were able to put some of those guys together to get harden while still keeping a few guys on ""larger"" contracts (joe harris, dinwiddie, dj; they were able to keep dinwiddie because he was hurt for the season and would be an FA, not that he benefits them at all barring being able to find an S&amp;T opportunity).  and that's pretty much it.  the lakers can't do it because they didn't get lebron+AD in free agency while their own desirable drafted guys were cheap, then give raises to those guys, _then_ use them to trade for someone else.  instead they only got lebron in FA, traded almost all those guys for AD, and gave raises to kuzma and KCP and had trezz helpfully opt in, and turned that into westbrook.  so now they're out of those mid-range contracts.  they can't give a fat contract to anyone else because they don't have bird rights on guys like caruso, the only guy they have bird rights for is schroder, and he might not get them anyone in return.  nets are way over the luxury tax threshold but they don't have to pay repeater tax.  gsw are way over the luxury tax threshold and do have to pay repeater tax.  lakers will only be significantly over the threshold if they manage to turn schroder into someone, otherwise they can't get far over even if they wanted to."
The Nets didn't have to trade as many assets to get Harden as we did to get AD. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie were already there while we had to give away any player equal or greater to that caliber to get AD.
"""We just need like a Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris type guy or two""   Oh yeah just those hundred million dollar contract players nbd"
ah yes forgot about that MAXIMUM CALIBER USA basketball team in 2019 which lost b2b games vs france and serbia. legendary 7th place team featuring:  mason plumlee  myles turner  harrison barnes  derrick white  joe harris  some real talent there. and yet they're all still better than kevin love lmfao.  BTW kevin love withdrew from that team.
"The thing about those ball dominant players is that 1) they're all better spot-up shooters than Shamet, and 2) all 3 have been hurt for stretches while on the team.  Outside of Joe Harris, those are the best shooters anyone could ask for.  So yes, having a backup fourth offensive threat is great to have in this case."
Why him? Joe Harris the fuck face cost Nets the series.
What ?. Joe Harris literally had a 3 pt to basically win the series in game 7 o.t and blew it.
"PG - Trae, Ja, Fox, LaMelo, Lonzo, Sexton, DeJounte Murray, Haliburton SG - Booker, Mitchell, Brown, Anthony Edwards SF - Ingram, Mikal Bridges PF - Zion, Tatum, John Collins, MPJ C - Bam, JJJ, Jarrett Allen, Mitchell Robinson  Bro, you need shooting you have Duncan Robinson, Seth Curry, Joe Harris... I know these guys aren't young, but you telling me you can't sell a single one of these dudes on the idea of an Olympic experience and gold medal? What, Duncan Robinson would rather do podcasts from his bedroom?  All under 25 years old... I'm sure i left off quite a few good young role players too... if you can't win with these cats against teams led bt 42-year old Scola and Pau then you deserved to get fired and never near a basketball court again in your life...  These excuses are getting ridiculous."
shamet has played with kd harden kyrie embiid butler george kawhi simmons and about to link up with cp3 and booker...add to that griffin aldridge lou will joe harris reddick tj mcconnell ayton marcus morris sga gallinari roco jarret allen levert dinwiddie noah shumpert
"I definitely think they’ll still be making moves. I also think the Warriors have made people overrate getting top tier shooters for playoff teams. The Warriors legit had the GOAT 3 point shooters so they shouldn’t be used as a comparison, if you look at other amazing shooters like Korver or Joe Harris, they’ve gone thru stretches in the playoffs where they’re cold as fuck, And then they have such limited value. Jae Crowder is a top tier 3 and D guy and he had a game in the finals where he had 1 point. Getting a player who can run the offense when Lebron subs out will always be good, and Westbrook has dominated in the pick and roll wit Steven Adams, jus imagine what he’ll be able to do wit AD. It’s either Westbrook getting to the basket or an easy mid range for AD everytime. I’m sure they’ll pick up shooters on the minimum or sign and trade Dennis still. Think it was a good trade honestly"
"Harden put up 30/8 on 65% TS last time he faced the lakers, the year they won the championship, when they were much better. His best teammate was supposed to be westbrook who was left wide open while harden was trapped the whole series. He put up 17/4 on 40% TS. You’re really implying that he’s a choker? Give him KD kyrie and joe Harris and try trapping him at half court. And westbrook is on *their* team now."
"&gt;How did Joe Harris do in the playoffs?  He wasn't being a good shooter, that's for sure."
"After losing Shamet, maybe they wanted a deep bench scorer in case of injuries. Outside of the Big 3 + Joe Harris, Shamet was pretty much the only scoring threat."
Cam Thomas is already an upgrade over Joe Harris
Oh ok cheap like Joe Harris.  Whoops 20 million per year.  Or Bertans.  Whoops 17 million per year.  Or Tim Hardaway Jr.  Whoops 18 million per year.  No elite shooters are signing bargain basement contracts anymore.
"Anthony Gill was Virginia basketball legend, he was on the same squad with Malcolm Brogdon and Joe Harris iirc"
It was Joe Harris and someone also mentioned Kyle Korver
Hes a lot better than Joe Harris
He is Joe Harris. LOLOLOL.
Joe harris is sexy joe harris
I think you mean sexier Joe Harris
Rich mans Joe Harris
Bruh that’s Joe Harris
Congrats on sexy Joe Harris
"Not uncommon to draft a decent role player or even an all-star at late 1st to early 2nd round (Jimmy Butler 30th, Draymond Green 35th, Joe Harris 33rd, Malcolm Brogdon 36th, Pascal Siakam 27th ...) Chances are really bad by late 2nd round"
"Also, the amount of people that think a good shooter means wins. How did Joe Harris do in the playoffs?"
Yeah but he's also a below average athlete and doesn't have a great handle. He's a poor man's Joe Harris
Joe Harris single handedly stopping the Nets from having a chance at a ring should have shut all these nephews up.
"Hahaha so funny that you’re getting hate for this. The Nets took the champs to the brink this year with no Kyrie, 5% of Harden and 10% of Joe Harris.   I hope this trade happens so I can get better odds on the Nets next year."
This a thread about the laker spacing. The nets flat out have more talent than anyone you are not beating them in a shooting ever.  For all the talks about injuries in game 7 of the bucks nets . A quarter fit harden had the same amount of points with the same efficiency as khris Middleton. Gianni's and KD did Gianni's and KD things. And the game hinged on tucker somehow being more efficient than Joe harris. The nets are supposed to sweep everyone. The Lakers having better 3 point shooters is not changing a damn thing
"I wonder if the Nets would be interested in flipping Kuz + Harrell for Hield since apparently that's what they're getting for Dinwiddie  If they get Jeff Green back on the taxpayer MLE they don't really need Kuz and Hield gives them some shooting, youth and competition for Joe Harris"
Kuzma and Joe Harris gonna build new stadiums in the playoffs
How much help does Joe Harris need
Exactly. Normal shooters go cold regularly. Not every shooter got 30 point quarters in them like Klay and Steph. All NBA talent bringing it every night. Look at Joe Harris playoffs or Korver finals. Cold at the wrong time.
Joe Harris and Andre Drummond in that plane too
&gt; Joe Harris.  You can have him. Please.
"Speaking as ""nerdy 5'8 Joe Harris"", absolutely."
Joe Harris shamet dinwiddie+picks
"I mean honestly I know there are plenty of good reasons it wouldn't happen but something resembling a Joe Harris + Bruce Brown for Simmons is fun to think about.  Simmons could play to his defensive and transition strengths while being one of the only non shooters on the floor, which would lessen the net effect he has on spacing.  Harris and Brown give Embiid room to work because Brown is serviceable in all parts of a pick and roll and Harris's shot always needs to be respected.  I don't think either side pulls the trigger because the Nets don't need any added uncertainty and Philly probably wants a playmaking guard plus picks but I also think both teams come out better off"
"This is a obvious  answer, KD.  KD lost by a toe to the champions with Joe Harris as his second best player. He seems to be back to himself and was the best player before getting hurt.  Warriors lose in 15 if Love and Kyrie are healthy. They won 72 games and lost in the Finals. They only became a playoff juggernaut  after KD came. I don't think there has ever been a Multiple time MVP winner with multiple titles in their prime and no FMVP. Steph is just the best batman ever.  Lwbron is gonna be 37. After a relatively healthy career LeBron has missed significant time 2 out of 3 years and the one year he wasn't hurt in there was a 5 month layoff to recuperate. Plus first year with tge Lakers LeBron was only 1 game over .500 while the 8th seed clippers were 14 games over. 500  This year the team that KD almost beat with Joe Harris handled the team that worked the Lakers once AD went down. Without AD LeBron isn't winning in tge playoffs and who knows if you can get a AD caliber to go with LeBron. And even if you do LeBron will be a little less next year and even a little less year 2."
Ight. We will take KD and Joe Harris.
Why didn't the Nets jusy give up Joe Harris for JJ? The world is full of mysteries.
"I think your front office’s counter argument to that would be something along the lines of that within the next 3 off seasons (counting this current one), all of your key players will be hitting free agency and outside of Gallo will be likely making as much if not more.   Your lineup is currently making X amount and in parentheses is a rough estimate of what the new contracts will be:  Young: $8M ($30M/year on next contract)  Collins: $5M ($30M/year)   Huerter: $4M ($15M/year)  Bog: $18M ($20M-$25M/year)   Hunter: $10M ($30M/year - I legit think he may already be your second best player and if teams are going to toss max offers at Collins, hunter will assuredly face the same issue)   Capela: $20M ($20M/year)  Gallo: $20M ($12M-$15M/year)  Reddish: $5M ($15M-$20M/year, I think he’ll get a Duncan Robinson/Joe Harris type of offer in RFA).  On the low end, if you kept all your current players I think you could see a payroll expand to $170M. It’s tough trying to sell off players that are about to hit RFA and I don’t think you’ll get full value for a guy like Huerter because teams will be scared into matching high offer sheets. If you draft another center that pans out I think between that guy and OO you could replace most of capela’s production with 2 rookie scale contracts over the next few years. Gallo is probably the guy that you can afford to let walk in a year or two. And trading cam takes another looming RFA contract off the table. This could get the payroll to a more manageable number over the next few years."
duncan robinson? joe harris?
"Yeah his 3 point volume is fantastic, defensively it would actually be interesting to watch an otherwise top defense with just one absolutely horrible defender. You can hide him to various degrees sure, but the Lakers path to another ring is having an absolute top tier defense and one bonehead defender even as a guard can be enough to screw that up when that's the standard.   These movement shooters like Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson(this yr), JJ Redick, you see in some playoff series they clearly have a harder time. Teams game planning for off ball actions, switching more, more focused transition defense and help, think its relevant here."
Even the missed Joe Harris 3 in OT
"Even so. That's a bad take. What's his closest comp? Joe Harris?   What is Pippen's comp? Ben Simmons but with way better shooting?  Now if those 2 were in a draft together, who are you picking?"
Ben Simmons for Joe Harris
"Yeah that's the logic of it your right. Im just lower I guess on Hield than the consensus. These movement shooter types also make me nervous in the playoffs, Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris, JJ Redick all these guys at times have problems against higher quality competition. Hield's defense is also a serious issue Lakers path to winning a title is as an absolute top notch defense, he provides such an easy target wholl get hunted mercilessly.   This may very well be the best they can get for those pieces though that is true. Still would say I like this alot more for Sacramento than LA but it's possible its a necessary trade more than a home run type trade for LA."
30 out of 30 teams would rather have Joe Harris
“Major” is an exaggeration.  $19M in the last year is probably going to be 15% of the cap by then.  Joe Harris is the same exact player and he’s getting close to that.
"If you think he’s better on defense than Fox and Hali, you don’t know basketball. That’s OK, nobody’s upset at you for it, I just think it would be better for you if you stopped giving your input on subjects you know nothing about.  Using Joe Harris being in a bad contract to justify Buddy being on a worse contract, that’s top-notch. Job well-done.  But yeah, you starting off a counterpoint with “Jesus Christ you’re delusional” is emotional, but the attempts at projection are very adorable 🥰 honestly, A for effort but horrible execution. Better luck next time sport!"
"Yeah, **I’m** the emotional one. He’s virtually identical defensively to Richaun Holmes, and a better on ball defender than Fox or Hali. Your emotions don’t change that.   &gt;	joe Harris is on a bad contract  It’s almost like shooters get paid and Buddy is elite at that  &gt;can’t and can’t say  Really slayed me with this one  &gt;	cry about it  Which one of us is crying lmfao"
"Weak. Injuries happen every year. LeBron made it out of the East for most of a decade against teams that were worse than the 2021 Nets in the second round, including their injuries. You make it sound like KD/half-Harden/Blake/Joe Harris is worse than the teams Bron rolled in the second round with the Heat and Cavs.  The Bucks were on the same side of the bracket as the Nets, so had they lost and the Nets had gone on to beat the Hawks and Suns, Nets fans surely wouldn't be saying their path was easy.  Y'all are just haters who need to live the goalposts when underdogs win. Y'all are fans of players, not teams, and it upsets you when KD and  Harden, unquestionable greats, don't get to automatically collect trophies because they're good on paper."
"I didn’t say that’s how FG% works.   And you are moving the goalposts here. The argument was that Steph is not a tier 1A player. I say he is because nobody can match his efficiency. Yes there are some players who might have a better % year to year, but comparing what Curry does to Joe Harris is a little silly. And if he is so bad a defense why does he have the 2nd best +/- in the league right now?  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/who-has-the-highest-career-plus-minus"
"You really think that's how FG% work?  Last year Joe Harris lead the league in 3PT FG% (not Steph) and Rudy Gobert (47.5%) lead the league in 2PT FG% (68%, also not Step.))  Steph shot 42% and 57% respectively.   Last year the Nets had the best 2PT FG% at 56.6% and the Clippers shot best from 3 at 41.1%. The Warriors shot 54% from 2 and 37.7%  from 3.   So yeah there are both players and teams that equal Steph's shooting on the offensive end. Offensive production doesn't have to come all from one player, and it's better that it doesn't. Hero ball loses in the playoffs more than it wins. With that being the case, Steph's horrible defense is what prevents him from being the best player in the L (or even top 3, maybe 5.)   Everybody loves scoring, but it's only half the game."

"As I'm thinking of a way to say this shit I KNOW I sound like a hater lmao. Not really. James Harden's my favorite player right now, and I've been watching him for like eight years now, so believe me when I say that this is his worst playoff showing by a significant margin due to injuries. People will talk about how injury prone Kyrie is, but it was a freak accident. Like obviously Giannis didn't do it on purpose, but it was definitely a huge factor in the outcome. Joe Harris also shrank severely, as to where he was damn near worthless in terms of offense/defense, and only supplied some gravity. At the end of the day, Giannis still won, and his championship is completely and 100% valid, and his team played exceptionally to survive KD, but he wasn't even the best player in that series. I'm not a hater, I swear. Giannis is still young, and he still might have a few rings ahead of him. KD's better right now, but he's on his way out and I have little to no doubt that Giannis will be the best player in a while. But still, I don't think he's done anything to even touch Hakeem in the playoffs."
Durant got 100% of the attention in that series especially once Kyrie went down. No one else on his team even scored 85 points for the series let alone 100. He played every competitive minute after Kyrie got hurt and still was incredibly efficient.  Take away Durant and Giannis and the Bucks had the next 4 best players in the series (I guess you could maybe argue 4 games of Kyrie &gt; Jrue/BroLo). Harden was on one hammy and Joe Harris was useless. Harris shoots even league average on wide open looks and they probably win that series. Instead it had to be a Durant solo job and he almost pulled it off. And normally when you have to pull THAT much offense your defense goes to shit but Durant still was one of the best Nets defenders.   I don't know how you could have watched that series and not viewed Durant as the better player. 1A to 1B would be the same tier technically just acknowledging that Durant is the superior player at this point in time which I think is fair.
A stat that rates joe harris as a negative offensive player but gives him the 4th highest defensive ranking is a flawed stat  Any stat that places Zion 6 ranks above AD and 10 ranks above giannis on the defensive PF rank is a flawed stat  Any stat that places buddy hield 1 rank behind AD is a flawed stat  You yourself not placing jokic above any of jimmy dray and AD shows that you consider it a flawed stat
"Ha statmuse's per possession stats have to be janky. I looked it up [since 1980](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-points-per-100-possessions-by-an-nba-player-minimum-7500-minutes-since-1980) and there's no way Joe Harris, Doug McDermott, and JJ Redick score 130+ points for every 100 team possessions."
For bum ass Joe Harris - just switch them out.
"Just chill. That shooting percentage doesn't inspire confidence, especially in a playoff setting that made Joe Harris looked like a YMCA scrub this past year."
he's gonna teach joe harris how to shoot 3 in playoff
Joe Harris. My guy got a bag but still wears the same 4 outfits he probably got for free from Nike lol
"I feel like that is the case but i got downvoted so maybe not a popular opinion, i mean they did take Milwaukee to 7 games and only lost the last game by 4 points, and you got joe harris' bum ass with 30% shooting and playing 46 minutes so I feel like you could just put in russ there and let him shoot 30% too and he would have still had more of an impact."
Career 39% in the playoffs.   Joe Harris shot 33% vs the Bucks.
"Silly take, you swapped matchups to fit a narrative.   Kyrie vs Steph is =   We’ve seen them play eachother. Kyrie is cold in big moments as a number 2 guy.   Draymond wasn’t anything special that year to be better than Joe Harris (best shooter in the league) and Blake + Patty mills."
Joe harris better
Finally Joe Harris can get the tutelage he needs
Damn maybe he can teach joe harris how to shoot in the playoffs
How much help does Joe Harris need?
He has almost the same contract as Joe Harris
"nonsense. choking is a player fucking up something they are good at. uncharacteristic from them. like CP3 making TOs, a Joe Harris missing good looks. a good FT shooter bricking them in the clutch, an elite scorer bricking everything... etc"
"Joe Harris missing every fucking open shot ever   Oh wait, that did cost us."
"Brooklyn doesn’t even need a completely healthy line up. If KD+1 can play 100% or close to it still makes them a legit contender, if no longer favorites. And by +1 I mean Kyrie, Harden, or Joe Harris."
"I dont think you're going to see the 4 of them in a closing line up, guess who i think will be out. Dont forget Joe Harris as well"
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
"He COULD fit the archetype easily.  Top 5 3pt% shooter in the league, and he's a premier defender.  We have to fault him in this conversation because he can do what Joe Harris does just as well as Harris along with a lot more?  OP didn't specify so if you're looking at snipers from downtown who play D, KD can't be ignored.  I gave Mikal Bridges if he's only asking for those 2 facets of the game, specifically."
"Shooting requires spacing. Either he could play as Joe Harris type guy who needs 3 players who take heat away from him, or he could himself have been a 3 level scorer. But his injury prevented the later from happening, and former was not in his control when he was about to retire."
"I mean ye but we were still on the way up without KD Kyrie and Harden. Also Sean has always managed to find good role players to contribute like Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Claxton, etc"
"Not really, imagine a guy like Dennis Schroder and a guy like Joe Harris, give them both a team to lead where they'll need to score a lot? The Dennis team is gonna be way better, but that's not what is asked of a role player like these two, so Harris gets, and will keep getting big contracts and minutes as long as he is a great 3pt shooter, while Schroder is clearly a better pure scorer, but often he takes the ball away from better players. If he falls in production he's out of the league, just like IT and unlike Joe Harris, or even worse guys, like a Tony Snell"
"The Lakers had to trade for two of their big 3 so they depleted more assets. They also don’t have any role players that happened to blossom like Joe Harris, or they definitely would have kept them. The other Nets role players like Blake or Mills signed with a similar situation to the Lakers current role players. You can definitely set it up better to get max value if everything goes right (including the specific order) but you also can’t be picky and if you have a chance for three all star caliber players, you do it."
"Yea, shoot like that in the playoffs when it matters. This team doesn't need Joe Harris in the regular season, but they do in the playoffs."
Joe Harris and Marcus Smart
"I mean I completely disagree with you, I'm not ignoring any of your points. You're saying that he's a 48% shooter and that's amazing - and I'm saying if you look past the big picture numbers and look at when they actually needed his shooting - it dissapeared.  If you horribly regress in the post season you're not that valuable. He still has a chance for future good series. If Lebron had his 2011 series and then never went back to the Finals, of course it would matter. Joe Harris still has time to show up when it matters, but he hasn't yet."
"Saw that Pacers' Malcolm Brogdon's charity is hosting a fundraiser where you can play fantasy football against NBA and WNBA players. They'll have a live draft event on August 26th. Right now the players are Diamond DeShields, Victoria Vivians, George Hill, Ty Jerome, Myles Turner, Garrett Temple, De'Andre Hunter, Justin Anderson, Joe Harris, Anthony Tolliver, Kevin Huerter, Malcolm Brogdon. https://www.brogdonfamilyfoundation.org/waterbowl"
Did you see Joe Harris this past playoffs?
17m is pretty much market value for sharpshooters these days. Almost all of them are quite overpaid except Joe Harris imo
Joe Ingles and Joe Harris were definitely the first two names that came to mind for me.

i trust big game patty more in the playoffs than joe harris. And Patty will get WIDE OPEN looks on this team.
What open 3s? Even an injured harden still had a man on him. I think you're confusing joe Harris and james harden bro.
Joe Harris is a way better fit on that roster than Dragic would be
Joe Harris + a few of their young guys for Dragic?
"&gt;He shot 45%. 45% on about 5 attempts a game is elite by any measure.  He's 68th in the league in volume, that's kinda the point. He's significantly behind players like Joe Harris and Joe Ingles, for example."
Clearly Simmons just needs to be surrounded by a Steph/Bertans/Duncan Robinson/Joe Harris supporting cast. It's that simple.
"Russ, AD, and Bron aren't very good or very consistent shooters, and usually attack the paint to get the bucket. That's why almost every team now has a guy like Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris."
You're over valuing Joe Harris. They lost that 7 game series against the bucks because he wasn't making anything.
Joe Harris is Bruce Banner when he couldn’t get it up during the big battle
"&gt;??? are you implying Patty isn’t a floor spacer? lmao  I hate how eager so many people are on this site to try to act smarter and more knowledgeable than others and to be patronizing at every opportunity.   Patty mills is a just above league average (league average is 35%, Patty shoots 37%-38%) 3pt shooter on 6 attempts per game.   Joe Harris is a 47% 3pt shooter on 6 attempts.   Patty is a decent scorer and arguably even better at spot up shooting, sure, but if it’s a team with KD, Gobert, and Doncic, I’d want a good ball handler/playmaker in that starting lineup and another who is an elite spot up shooter. I’d want Patty off the bench to provide energy and scoring for the backup unit.   That’s what I meant by “spacer,” not someone like Patty with an upper mediocre 3pt shot. Could’ve just asked what I meant instead of being so condescending."
&gt;	Joe Harris &gt; Patty &amp; Rubio   ???  are you implying Patty isn’t a floor spacer? lmao
Solid list… I had to do a double take on Harris… I thought it was Joe Harris until I realized you meant Gary Harris.
"The current starting 5? I think yes.   ~~KD = KD~~  Harden ≈ Doncic   Kyrie &gt;&gt; Patty &amp; Rubio  Joe Harris &gt; Patty &amp; Rubio   Gobert &gt;&gt;&gt; Blake   I think the absolute best teams have balance. When choosing between Kyrie and Gobert, different teams might select one over the other in order to improve where they’re lacking. Brooklyn, however, has two of the best scorers to ever play the game. They have more to gain from a generational defender than they do from a top tier scoring point guard. Joe Harris is what makes me hesitant to say this is a clear cut decision, but if you slide Patty to 6th man and pick up a floor spacer, this team is better than Brooklyn 10 times out of 10.   Another thing is that Patty, Rubio and Gobert stay relatively healthy, which can’t be said for Kyrie."
"Dame — Curry — green — harris — Embiid. Milton, Korkmaz, Joe, Reed, and Drummond off the bench. Fill out the roster with vet mins and the TPE."
How dare you slander the legendary Joe Harris like that
"Ah, Harden missed every game Aldridge played. Well now we just need Joe Harris to make the HOF lol."
Joe Harris
😂 Nah he's right Joe Harris was carrying KD that series. KantWin DurCant reverts to Tony Snell without his superstars.
Joe Harris to make a single open shot.
"Joe harris, someone else can guard them"
"Kobe has the ability to hit the same contested 3s that curry does. He has a 20 year resume of hitting clutch contested 3s, its not confirmation bias.   Curry is not a better passer, theres a reason why draymond is the point guard for the warriors.   So overall Kobe has more PPG, more athletic, Better in the post, better at attacking the rim, mid range, footwork, Defense, passing, got to the line more, and lastly Clutch factor.   Curry has volume, range, and ""off ball"", thats it. Youre grasping at straws talking about ""off ball"". Thats for spot up 3pt shooters. Compre any other superstars and off ball wont get mentioned once. Curry is a glorified joe harris lucky enough to play on a stacked roster and benfitted heavily when the league switched to more spacing after the 2011 knicks had success moving melo to the 4.  Its a disgrace curry is mentioned in the same light as previous superstars when his talents are not even half as good as previous stars like Kobe Lebron or Magic johnson."
"sadly i agree. they dont have a complete team. rebounding is terrible, defense is suspect. joe harris chokes.  doesnt help that the lakers are looking like the champs on paper already."
Dame tanking his value this game so he can be traded to the Nets for Blake Griffin and Joe Harris.
TLC would have made those 3s against Bucks unlike Joe Harris
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"Chemistry &gt; fit in terms of super teams. Chemistry + fit &gt; chemistry.   I don’t think either trio is that good of a fit in terms of roles, but to me, already it seems like AD, Bron, and Russ like each other more, and seem to better get along with the roster. Look how LeBron treated Caruso, while Kyrie probably barely talks to Joe Harris."
Because they beat a bunch of injured teams ? They barey beat Durant with joe Harris how they gonna beat that warriors twam
"Oh I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with someone who spent 2 whole minutes on a player bref page after hearing about him for the first time. That kinda dedication to analysis just can't be matched. I salute your analytical prowess.   Every advanced stat backs him up:   1.6 Lebron (compares to: Derozan, Ja Morant, Robert Covington, Myles Turner)   1.7 EPM (compares to: Lowry, Middleton, Sabonis)   2.0 Raptor (compares to: Ayton, Vuc, Royce O'Neale, Joe Harris, Jaylen Brown)     He started in the closeout game for a championship team. He's a fantastic guard defender, hustles for loose balls, and has great IQ.   But I can see how all of that is easy to miss when the entirety of your bball knowledge is listening to Microsoft Narrator read you bref pages since your blindness prevents you from actually watching games."
That Joe Harris is a choker.  Hes had a bad couppe of playoff series sure but I believe Joe is gonna step up next time
Agreed. The nets cannot survive with this team for longer than 2 years likely and they’ll either have to dump joe Harris or just break up the big 3
Nets should trade Joe Harris. And this is an opinion I had before the playoffs started. We would make KD’s life easier on defense and overall would be a better defensive team.
Every fan base does this. Yall act like this is new. SA fans still shit on RJ. Lakers fans hated on Dwight before his redemption arc. Elfrid is hated on by Knicks fans when we didn’t even have playoffs expectations to start the year. Joe Harris is public enemy number one to Nets fans after playoffs. Stop acting like Dennis is any different. Only thing unique is he fumbled the bag while being irresponsible during covid and demanded a starting job on a championship team and underperformed. Has nothing to do with some special Lakers/LeBron hate.
"Hmm, some 3-way trade where Joe Harris goes to another contender, Thad Young goes to Brooklyn, and that third team sends the Spurs some expiring salary/intriguing prospect and a late 1st? I don't know.   But you're right in that it's difficult, he makes slightly more than that 11.5m exception that Brooklyn has.   TBH I wish my team would trade for him, Thad is probably one of the few players I'd willingly trade Marcus Smart for."
"Well Kyrie and KD are two of the greatest end of the shot clock guys of all time so they won't just have to rely on Joe Harris knocking down open shots (which he's totally due for after last postseasons disappointment, but regardless, they have 2 of the greatest back up plans to wide open 3 point shots from a great shooter in the history of the game)"
"Nets will have KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and JJ Reddick as their shooters. Lakers will have size, and they will outrebound the Nets like crazy, but the Nets' advantage in their 3 point shooting will be unfair."
"That's a good deal for the Knicks, Fournier has been carrying France in the Olympics, and other guys like Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson etc are getting close to 20/yr too, and they aren't really playmakers like he is."
"bwahaha, im white and notice this allllll of the time. i think the dad bod helps too bc we are all on reddit.  oh man, at least luka has some skill, even if a whiny baby, i remember regular season joe harris threads acting like he was the goat....."
Hobbled harden had the same amount of point and efficiency as full 100 %. Middleton in game 7 . And jrue had 14 on catastrophic efficiency. The game hinged in Pg tucker somehow being more efficient than Joe harris
"&gt; Nets - Mills **Harris** Brown Claxton  Joe Harris? He's not coming off the bench.  Right now the only guys who seem to have guaranteed rotation minutes off the bench are Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton.   I would not put the Nets in the top 5."
Joe Harris 100% forgot how to play basketball that series
That was not Joe Harris bruh the Monstars stole his talent
You’re right. What a bum. He couldn’t beat the Bucks with Joe Harris and 0.000000002% of Harden
"So prove it.  What is your definition of best shooter? Steph Curry is still easily the best shooter in the league by both the eye test and stats and not close.  Durant is also in a different universe. Shot eFG% of fucking 60.8%, 53.7% on 2s, 45% on 3s, and 88% from FT.  So those are 2 unarguables.   For last year specifically Zach Levine had a much better shooting year (killed Dames numbers on similar volume), but hasn’t had the same year to year consistency.  Kylie Irving also was head and shoulders above Dame, literally in the 50/40/90 club last year.  Now we get into what you define as a good shooter. Harden had a worse year statistically last year, but I don’t think many people would argue he’s a worse shooter.  Seth Curry has smaller volume but shoots WAY better than Dame, esp from 3. Joe Harris also had much lower volume but blew away the eagle in combined 2 pt and 3pt shooting. 47.5% on 6.4 3pt attempts per game.  And ofc Klay Thompson was hurt, but is anyone really taking Dame over Klay for shooting?  So last year Dame was at least 5th, if not 7th or 8th depending on how you judge shooting. Going into next year assuming Klay and Harden are healthy, I’m easily putting Steph, Durant, Harden, Kylie, and Thompson as better shooters.  So yeah, I won’t wait for you to respond with facts, cause I know they aren’t coming."
My sources tell me they are still trying to find Joe Harris after the ECSF series. Man is missing please keep an eye out for a 6’7 bearded Caucasian man.

"This makes no sense with all due respect. Just KD and Kyrie was giving this team problems. KD on his own took them down to the Wire with harden on a grade 2 hamstring injury and multiple turnovers. No Kyrie and Joe Harris being a negative on both ends of the floor  Common sense says it is rather easily to say the Nets win that series as they have the better big 3. Atleast wait a few more months before you start lying about what healthy Nets would mean and trying to resuse the “defense” excuse lol  Hobbled Nets were the toughest challenge for the nba champions all playoffs. Heat, ATL, nor Suns took the Bucks to the brink like we did. KD and Kyrie were beating this team down and the one game the Bucks did win while Kyrie was healthy(game 3), they won by less than 9 points. Imagine harden playing?"
Team sucks at shooting. You always need to save a slot for a Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Marcus Morris kind of guy.
Kcp stepped up in the finals and joe Harris struggled in the ecf.   More reliable than joe if anything
kcp better than joe harris
"It's just a weird post given the circumstances of the series.  Milwaukee barely beat Brooklyn with almost their full roster whereas Brooklyn almost beat Milwaukee (obviously they didn't) missing two (healthy) all-star caliber players.  To me that implies that KD might not actually ""need all of the help he needs to get past that greek fucking freak.""    To me it seems like KD could have done it with even marginally  more production from a guy like Joe Harris."
"They can trade Joe Harris for Andrew Wiggins, Golden State gets another excellent floor spacer who's going to get a lot of open 3's just like the KD era and more cap space, Nets get an excellent defender."
Yeah that was definitely the vibe I got from their series this past year. Durant really needed all the help he got from mike James shamet joe Harris ans Jeff green.
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
Yo this was my answer too. If harden kyrie harden aren’t open… give me an open cam johnson jumper. I know Joe Harris would miss it
with these type of players there’s always a chance that they could choke in the playoffs (Joe Harris)
Joe Harris will be dealt to the Shanghai Sharks. Dont ask how I know tho...
"How? Dude has the best release in the league, probably in league histrory. Even without his normal speed/burst he'll be capable of running faster than Joe Harris and his defensive IQ will still be there."
"Joe Harris is the biggest game changer, he single-handedly won the Bucks that series.  Ok if you mean in that matchup then yes I agree AD is the biggest game changer. He'll need to be Giannis-like to beat them tho, not afraid of banging down in the block."
"I always confuse Tony Bradley with Thomas Bryant, so at first I was excited that the Bulls got a guy like Nikola who could stretch the floor from center. Then I looked up Tony Bradley and realized he's not Thomas Bryant, but Bradley's advanced metrics are still pretty solid (20+ PER in limited minutes, for instance). So, I'm in.  Anyway, it's nice to have a solid offseason after two decades of going through things like:  * This is Phil's last year no matter what/Breaking up the best team in league history to satisfy Krause's ego. * Thinking Marcus Fizer was a small forward/an NBA player * ~~Asking Tracy McGrady if he'll shave his cornrows~~ \[Edit: Turns out I may be conflating two different stories on this one.\] * Drafting LaMarcus and trading him for Tyrus Thomas * Signing late era Ben Wallace and trading early era Ben Wallace (I.E., Tyson Chandler) * Picking the wrong Italian head coach (Del Negro instead of D'Antoni) * Striking out on LeBron, Wade, Bosh to get Boozer (who was admittedly solid and goofy) * Making Luol Deng get a spinal tap * Trading Korver for nothing * Running Thibodeau out of town * Trading Nurkic and Gary Harris for Doug McDermott, then trading Doug McDermott, Taj Gibson, and a second round pick for Cameron Payne then waiving Cameron Payne * Hiring Hoiberg to run a modern perimeter-based offense then signing Wade and Rondo * Giving up on Bobby Portis because he struck a Spaniard * \[Some additional edits\]: * [~~Jim Boylan~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylan) The wrong [Jim Boylen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boylen). * Waiving Dinwiddie (thanks to u/darealcubs for the reminder) * Just the bewildering love affair with all things Iowa State. * Trading for John Starks * Completely forgot about the short-lived John Salmons era that ended with the Bulls trading Salmons and draft picks that turned out to be Isaiah Thomas and Larry Sanders for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick * Not locking up Rusty LaRue on a long term deal.  Not sure I got this all in chronological order, and obviously there were some really fun Bulls teams in there (the scrappy Ben Gordon-led teams and the Derrick Rose + Bench Mob teams of the early 10s), but I am very happy with what the Bulls have done this past couple of days. This is 100% me being a homer, but I think the only teams in the East that are clearly better are Milwaukee and Brooklyn. (""Clearly"" being the key word there.)  Anyway, I'm wearing the shit out of my Bulls hat today and now I need to stop procrastinating and get back to work."
"On paper it’s pretty damn Close.   PG —- Harden &gt; RW SG —- Kyrie &gt;  Ellington or Alt. SF —-LBJ &gt; joe Harris  PF —-KD &gt; AD C —-Gasol &gt; Griffin  To me what matters in this matchup Is intangibles. LBJ and Harden hold the biggest differential IMHO. Defensively Lakers, albeit a little old hold an edge almost at every position.   Both teams lineups are pretty flexible."
Joe Harris or Bruce brown?
"except he isnt  just off the top of my head steph, dame, seth, joe harris, ingles, paul george, klay"
"Joe Harris was post LeBron. Though I'll say Danny Ferry was terrible at drafting. If DaJuan Wagner lived up to the hype and didn't get injured, he would've been perfect alongside bron. Daniel Gibson was maybe the best pick they had and he peaked in the 2007 Pistons series lol"
"Nets still has joe Harris  And kd doesn’t change much post Achilles injury if we only play one game  Nets offence should edge slightly, but arguable since warriors offence is 3pts where nets is less efficient"
"It's everyone's fault. But the Simmons issues with shooting and free throws didn't begin magically during the playoffs. Doc had a season to make adjustments about how better to utilize Ben so that he didn't get completely shut down with playoff basketball. That didn't happen.   So that part is Doc's fault. Because this isn't a case of Joe Harris, a normlly solid shooter who got shut down. Ben was a terrible scorer who became even more terrible during the playoffs."
"DLS fell off as of late because the school is not willing to *openly* recruit like Mater Dei and St John Bosco. The Spartans have always attracted talent through camps, word of mouth, and notoriety. But now players realize they can stay home and still go big time (Joe Mixon, Najee Harris), or go for even bigger lights (Raleek Brown from Stockton went to Mater Dei). If DLS had the same philosophy as Mater Dei the games would be far more even."
Maybe Joe Harris vs bucks comes close
"I don’t disagree with you. I just don’t like how the previous comment was phrased. Harden and Curry took advantage of the rules set during their time and dominated with their skillset the same way Bird and Magic did. Steph is still the shooting GOAT but to say Bird ain’t in the discussion of greatest is naive to say the least. If volume and percentage takes precedence over context then the likes of pure marksmen (really good in their own right) like wayne ellington, joe harris, duncan robinson, and jj redick will get the nod over Bird? But he was able to defeat all the “shooters” back in his day in three straight three point contests whilst being around 8% better than league average for his 3pt shooting prime."
Plus they were pretty inept with drafting/developing. They had some picks along with lebron. Man they had Danny Green and Joe Harris at some points
"I don't think Team 2 has enough shooting. Joe Harris needs to start over Lopez, but even then there's going to be hardly any space on the floor. Team 3 is the best constructed imo, they have a good mix of defense and offense."
"Ben Wallace anchored a defense on one of the greatest defensive teams in the league.  For 7 straight seasons (2000-2006 seasons) he averaged 2.3, 3.5, 3.2, 3.0, 2.4, 2.2, 2.0 blocks per game.  Altering WAY more shots than that per game and further attributing to their team defense.  Those pistons only averaged 90 possessions per game- virtually every team now is above 100.  Way less opportunities to pad stats.   Also primarily guarded shaq 1 on 1 in the 2004 finals where they dominated the lakers.  And they should've won back to back if not for Robert Horry...        I get it- in an offense driven league defense all looks the same.  But comparing his resume to one of Theo Ratliff, Marcus Camby, Tony Allen... That's crazy talk man.   That's like saying Joe harris is as good of a shooter as Steph because his percentage is  just as good.  Everyone knows harris's are catch and shoot three's from other peoples creation- Where steph can create for himself, takes crazy difficult shots, is the opponents primary defensive game plan, and has led his team to championships/made countless shots to win games.  One is Hall of famer and passes the eye test (.433 on 8.4 attempts per game) , One has a nice 3 pt %. (.438 on 4.8 attempts per game).     I will agree that he's on the cusp or not an automatic ""get in"".  But he did historic things for his position and for his era that don't happen often.  So to me he had a good case to make it eventually"
"My only problem with them is sometimes they overvalue purely stats based players. IE in their eyes D’Lo and Derozen will never have value while Joe Harris is a top tier valued player. I don’t inherently disagree with their thinking at all, I just think sometimes they go to hard sometimes on those kinds of players. Overall I’d still say they’re the best podcasters for basketball in the business.  Edit: oh and Nate for sure comes across as a know it all ass sometimes. But, for me it’s not something that bad, but I can see how some people hate it."
The 2014 allstar game had   Roy Hibbert   34 year old Joe Johnson averaging 16/3/2   Joahkim Noah    2010 allstar game   David Lee   Chris Kamen   Gerald Wallace    2009 allstar game   Devin Harris   Mo Williams   Jameer Nelson
Joe Harris
"&gt; I mean, what exactly could the Nets have done in your opinion to even have this supposed ""top 3"" offseason? Like that's ridiculous lol  Nets really couldn’t have. Unless they traded Joe Harris for like Myles Turner or something and ended the league. That’s what happens when you’re over the cap and can only offer minimum deals and a MLE.   &gt; I graded them on extending KD, which is enormous on its own right, because he's arguably the best player in the game right now. If not, top 3 no debate. THAT can't just be ignored, idk what you're talking about there.  But again there are 4 other franchise corner stones who got extended. They aren’t anywhere near mentioned as a top offseason winner. An extension, (unless it’s like Giannis when people think he was a strong chance at leaving) isn’t a big win. It’s a good move but if that’s your best move you’re not a top offseason.  &gt; Second, ""Mills was getting the deal no matter where he went"" What? So because that you think that, that automatically makes the Nets getting him a lesser value. And how does Millsap being a late signing matter? It's a signing in the offseason, who tf cares when it happens?  For Mills It means they’re a top FA destination and didn’t get huge discounts, unlike the Lakers. It doesn’t make it a lesser value but it puts the Lakers offseason over theirs, LAARP or not. Millsap is washed and if he was a hot FA commodity he’d be signed the first week.   &gt; And for as good as Jeff Green was, you're treating him like he would be the sole reason the Nets would win a championship. There's a reason why he's a journeyman.  You’re right but honestly Jeff Green’s contributions last season &gt; James Johnson and a washed Paul Millsap."
Are you saying you haven't watched enough basketball to be able to tell the difference in playstyle between Steph and Joe Harris?
" FTs are big part of the game if he cant get to the ft line, is a weakness who cant be ignored, and its not like joe harris, seth curry and a lot of other catch and shoot players have a lot of Fta, he is just inneficient and very inconsistent for someone who only good atribute is shooting 3s"
If the other team has harden kyrie Davis Blake lamarcus mills joe Harris then yeah. Nets are just better constructed and deeper. Lakers spacing would still suck with Durant.
Lakers improve more but the nets still win the championship. Nets are still way more loaded top to bottom and Davis solves their biggest issue which is a big man. Durants scoring is somewhat of a luxury on a team with harden kyrie joe Harris mills Blake lamarcus. And it’s not like AD doesn’t average 27 a game himself.
"Did you edit your comment? Could of sworn you put Joe Harris instead of Jeff Green. Nonetheless, I was just giving examples of long, strong players who could help build a wall (which you'd really want 3 players to help execute here). Heat also had Jimmy Butler, Iggy, and Olynik to help Bam/Crowder.   To put it into perspective the Suns had Cam Johnson as their 3rd biggest player at 210 pounds. The Heat had 7 players bigger than Cam playing in that series. Giannis averaged 21 points vs the Heat."
"Ayton and Crowder are too small to build the wall? but Blake/Joe Harris, and Bam/Crowder are bigger? you're taking the piss."
"people go back and forth on if Bertans, joe harris, hield and duncan robinson but they’re worth it to each team to keep a shooter that good on the team"
Fletcher Magee who is basically a JJ Redick / Joe Harris hybrid didn’t even get a fair shot at the NBA and he was probably the best shooter in the class a couple years ago.
"That's just weird, at that point playmaking just means ""offensive value on plays you don't shoot"" when it's traditionally referring to a specific set of skills on-ball.  You can talk about the value Joe Harris and Kyle Korver create in plays they don't finish without calling it playmaking."
Does Joe Harris take the same types of shot as Steph?
"Just like Joe Harris?  Shoots a lot of 3s, but less than Steph. Is he better because his percentage is better?"
"You're being silly. You cant compare Joe Harris to Steph when Steph shoots such higher difficulty shots. There's 3 factors at play, percentage, volume and difficulty. Steph is elite in all 3. In the comparison of Harris to Curry, Steph shoots twice as many, with much higher difficulty on a lot of them (1st option on offense, deeper, off the dribble vs 4th option on offense, catch and shoot) and still has elite efficiency (42% vs 47.5%)  You can compare Dame and Steph cause they both shoot similar shots, Steph is just better at it. Just as Steph shoots twice as many 3s as Joe, Dame shoots twice as many logo 3s as Steph but the efficiency gap is too big to ignore (36% vs 44%) when the types of threes are the same.  Steph's the GOAT from 3 for a reason."
No one is saying it's a fluke. But doubling the volume is always impressive  Joe Harris has made enough 3s for it not to be a fluke...doesn't mean I think he's a better shooter than Steph simply becsuee he's got a higher 3P%
Joe Harris better than Steph confirmed.  Guess nothing but raw percentage matters anymore
"Joe Harris choked in the playoffs, he was excellent in the regular season and was a liability in the post season. I expect much of the same unless they can find the better rotation, if Harden is healthy and is put on a rotation with Harris for the first 3 quarters and then put the big 3 in the last 5-7 minutes to close out the game I feel they could have better success. Harden was playing like the best player in the world the first couple months last year. More of that and no one is beating a healthy nets"
"MVP: Steph (Klay’s coming back so they could secure at least a 3 or 4 seed)  DPoY: Giannis or Ben Simmons.   MIP: MPJ. (This is a biased pick. Outside of LeBron and Steph, he’s my favorite to watch)  ROtY: Cade Cunningham (I’m going off of Summer league only)  6MoY: Joe Harris or Bobby Portis."
MVP: Dame Lillard (I know its bold)  DPOY: Giannis Acantspellhislastname  MIP: Og Anunoby  ROY: Jalen Green  6MOY: Joe Harris
Randle was All NBA second Team and had the whole of New York saying he’s a max player. Joe Harris went from 14 PPG on 47 3P% to 11 PPG on 40 3P% is which isn’t a huge drop off
Did you watch joe Harris this year?
"That argument doesn't hold man. You can't just ignore volume.   For example, Steph never leads the NBA in 3P%. There's always guys that take a decent volume of 3s with a higher percentage  - like Joe Harris.   Would you take Joe Harris over Steph? Hell no. Both matter. As does context. You can reasonably assume that if you take more you're probably getting a lower quality shot on average."
Don't compare Jordan to Joe Harris. Compare him to KD: he shoots a decent amount of 3 and it opens up his game. MJ's view is simply outdated.
Nets bench is getting too much love here for the players that are actually there. I like the Lakers depth more but Joe Harris is the best player in the of the depth pieces. Overall I’d go Lakers.
"Honestly, all of them because of LeBron. He's the best player in the league at elevating role players, even in the playoffs. Joe Harris really choked last year, and the other Nets role players are also pretty old or unproven.  I do like the Nets' depth better, but ""not even close"" isn't a word I'd use. Not sure it matters in the end, if KD, Kyrie, and Harden ball out it won't matter how the role players do."
It’s not even close is an exaggeration imo. Joe Harris is the best player among this group and then after that the role players are pretty much on the same level.   - Mills = Nunn - Brown = Monk - Milsap = Melo - Blake = Dwight   Still need to see LMA play after the initial heart issues.
Joe Harris is not a good example of this
Joe Harris can take it to the rack
Joe Harris does a lot more than shoot the ball but I get what you're saying.   I agree and disagree with you. Players nowadays are expected to do more than things just have one skill. The guys you have mentioned are specialists and at the top of that category in what they do. Duncan doesn't get 17 mil annually because he's an okay shooter. He gets it because he's an otherworldly shooter.
He’s spot on though. A lot of players these days play style  is so limited to catching and shooting that they’re virtually useless outside of that one skill. I’ve never seen Duncan Robinson/Joe Harris do anything but shoot the ball and that’s worth $17 million annually. Why work on any other part of my game when I get paid $100 million just to shoot 3s?
Guys who stand in the corner. Danny Green or Joe Harris type of players.
"Nets have depth too lol what  Their top 10 guys: Kyrie, Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, LMA, Bruce Brown, Millsap, Claxton.   James Johnson/Jahlil/Jevon Carter at the end of the bench"
"Gobert scored more points last season than guys like DeAndre Ayton, Joe Harris or Harrison Barnes, people act as if he's some kind of second coming of Ben Wallace offensively.  He's a great role player on that side, he's aware of his limited skillset but elite at everything he does."
I don't think you can be one dimensional and be a star. Best one dimensional player that comes to my mind is Joe Harris.
If MPJ and Barton are marching Harden who is matching LMA and Joe Harris.  Or Patty Mills and Blake
"Depends what my goal is. Making the playoffs? Yeah then I’m very alarmed. Winning a game and not being worse than the Thunder and Rockets? Not concerned at all. Wiseman, Moody and Kuminga would all have 30+ point games once in a while if we’re starting them for the better part of 82 games. All 3 average over 15. I don’t get how Klay won’t be league average. Joe Harris exists man. Shooters still shoot and Klay should be over 38% from 3 next season."
outside of those 5 games vs the bucks joe harris shooting a 3
People say this like he didn’t have a noticeably better game and overall series than Giannis.   If Joe Harris doesn’t turn into Andre Roberson minus the defense that series we’re looking at 3x NBA Champ and FMVP Kevin Durant.
Nothing changed. He bitched out last year and cost the team a big run. He’s gonna pussy out again or hard choke in the playoffs. Some players are just born chokers like Joe Harris or lma and having them means you won’t win.
Joe Harris off the bench as a shooter probably works.
Yeah that’s what I’m saying they were one of the best passing teams because of three superstars and Joe Harris
kinda easy to have good spacing when u have 3 3 point monsters and joe „like 44% on 3 in the reg season“ harris
Yeah y’all literally had the best spacing in the league lmfao and people act like it was iso why do they think Joe Harris got all these good shots
"They did they slow rebuild and made the playoffs before getting kyrie and kd, with none of their own first round picks to boot. They turned Dlo from a joke to an all star, and found a ton of great players - caris levert, dinwiddie, joe Harris, etc. Showing that they had a great front office def played a big role in getting the stars to come (see: knicks)  Also the Spurs just made the playoffs for 20 straight years lmfao idk why you feel like you need to trash nets fans for feeling good about their squad. You keep saying you just asking questions but it reads super passive aggressively"
Surprised Joe harris
"LMA is still a productive nba player despite his age, and Joe Harris having one bad series against a bucks team where he damn near turned into the 2nd primary offensive focus doesn’t make him a playoff chocker lmfao. What about the series literally right before that where our team was actually healthy and he was averaging 13ppg and shooting 50% from 3…Or did that just not happen??"
Joe Harris has underperformed in every meaningful series ever.
Happened with the clippers in 2020 as well. Everyone said it was over the second they got kawhi and pg and that no one could beat them.   Being a contender and actually winning are two very different things. Nets have the ability to win a ring with their talent but injuries/defense are very real problems. Also you never know how role players will do under pressure. Everyone was claiming Joe Harris was essentially a fourth star due to his shooting in the regular season. No one could have predicted he would be an absolute negative and couldn’t even hit a wide open three to save his life when it mattered.
"If you go back and watched Harden and Kyrie during the playoffs, you would see that they both were very solid on defense. Much better than Mike James and Joe Harris, for example."
Yeah I watched that entire season. DLO on the nets earned his all-star spot.. and while he had joe harris he was getting non-shooters like allen and RHJ involved. That was a fun run
I still think plus-minus stats are effectively worthless for isolating defense. Duncan Robinson is not a top 10 defensive player in the NBA and Joe Harris isn't top 5 like RPM suggests.
"Joe Harris 4.00, best wing defender in the league?"
"DBPM has its limitation, just look at some of the top dudes on the list, you really gonna tell me Joe Harris, reggie bullock, Duncan Robinson, etc ar elite defenders?"
And all of the stuff that helps Joe Harris maintain his conditioning wouldn't travel back with him I assume.
"Their conditioning, general skill level, and shooting percentages would still be godly. Joe Harris weighs 5 lbs more than Bill Russell lmfao"
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity
The most in their prime star studded finals.  In reality it’ll be a lot of Nets BIG 3 Joe Harris and Blake Griffin vs Lakers Big 3 plus shooters as the older guys are all bad defensive players outside of Dwight.
Joe Harris missed a shitload of shots.   After Kyrie went down it was pretty much KD doing his own thing and I think Blake really showed up for one game offensively.  I'm saying LMA probably could have scored 10 points by taking some of the shots that other players (like Harris) took and missed like crazy.
He would make the shots that Joe Harris was clanking.
"KD played all 53mins for a reason, Kyrie was out and Harden was on 1 leg  Aldridge would have given them something considering Joe Harris conveniently decided to forget how to shoot a basketball vs the Bucks"
If they played green over Joe Harris at least in the 4th quarter of game 7 they would be champions. Horrible coaching by Steve Nash.
"Jeff Green was absolutely amazing. I can’t believe we let him go especially considering how much he got paid.  He was what we all thought Joe Harris would be in the playoffs. Every time he shot the 3, it felt like it would always go in."
Only player left is Joe Harris
How much help does Joe Harris need?
"Joe Harris was an elite three-point shooter too. These guys are shooting wide open jumpers lol. Kerr was a bum that someone found himself in so many lucrative situations, wonder why.. Just like Scott Brookes becoming an NBA headcoach lol."
"With a bench of: D’Angelo Russell, Joe Harris, and Kristaps Porzingis"
I have the 2021 Bucks in mind for this team makeup  Marcus Smart - 2nd playmaker/Defense  Joe Harris - Spacer  Joe Ingles - Spacer/Playmaker  LeBron  Jarrett Allen - Lob Threat/Boards
"I’m gonna guess Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, and Patty Mills"
"So Joe Harris is a better regular season 3 point shooter than Curry then, if that's the way we're trying to do things   Please go watch Game 5 and Game 6 of the 2016 finals and please tell me Kyrie isn't better than Curry at layups. Curry got blocked by lebron so many times he refused to even attempt layups   One of the reasons the Cavs won down 3-1 is Lebron stopped Curry from getting layups and he shut him down whenever he got to the paint."
"Brooklyn. KD, Joe Harris, and a first would probably get it done. Maybe throw in Claxton too."
yeah why would BKN give Joe Harris and Picks for Marcus Morris while helping out philly lmao
"RPM is completely broken since ESPN revamped it two seasons ago.   Jordan Poole and Lonzo Ball being ahead of Jokic in ORPM is hilarious, as are Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson being top 10 in DRPM. It's embarrassing for ESPN to continue publishing it.  The other advanced stats had him averagish in 2021: +0.1 in EPM, +0.4 in LEBRON, -0.6 in RAPTOR."
"EFG% and more specifically TS% account for the extra variables you are tracking. TS% accounts for all three percentages and weighs them by respective attempts, as you can imagine people like curry and harden, who have not only high percentages, but also insane volume, do very well.  TS% is also pretty cool because you can more easily compare different styles of play, like demar derozan versus steph curry, versus Davis Bertrans versus domantas Sabonis. You still need the eye test to understand why they are different, it can be enlightening to know that joe Harris has a higher true shooting percentage than deandre ayton. (66 versus 65)"
Joe Harris?
You mixed Joe Harris and Marcus smart up lol
u mean when he had lethal shooters in kd harden and joe harris for spacing?
How about taking shots from joe Harris mike James Jeff green and Bruce brown ?  This argument by bucks fans is hilarious. I get that you wanna believe in the team but acting like somehow harden being there would take shots from Durant is bad is crazy. He creates easy shots for everyone and he was actually still playing and taking shots he just couldn’t drive at all or shoot so he sucked. He’d be taking shots from himself basically and being a lot better on offense and defense e
do u know the difference between a hooper and a basketball player? tim duncan has no bag. blake griffin is a hooper. tim duncan is a basketball player. kyrie irving is a hooper. joe harris is a basketball player. this is a well established concept im not making this up
Blake Griffin Joe Harris Bruce Brown big three better imo. Offensive rating of 133 in 19 games
"The bigger problem is philly wants to compete so it is much harder trading him since they don't want expiring contracts and picks.  The Nets, Warriors and Clippers all would be very willing to pay his salary as 3rd/4th option. Luke Kennard + Bledsoe or DeAndre + Joe Harris would all be immediately done from their side but that philly would not want ofc."
you mean after kyrie gets hurt? Yeah real tough mentality to beat a team whos second best scoring option is joe harris and he shoots 25% from 3. And they still nearly lost. Bucks clearly gained mental strength after beating the nets because they looked like a complete joke during that series.
I hear you man. The nets were inches from beating the bucks last year. My man Joe Harris hits some 3s in the playoffs this year and we’ll be fine :)
"Nah they were terrible. I remember watching as a kid. Kidd was nice, but Jefferson was too young to stop Kobe and Kerry Kittles wasn’t gonna be it either. Keith Van Horn was 2000s Joe Harris"
You telling me Durant jeff green joe Harris and Blake are better than the 02 nets ? Got it.
Durant joe Harris Blake Bruce brown and Jeff green is definitely amazing. That’s the team the bucks beat. The best team they beat was the suns who only got there cuz of injrueisb
joe harris
"That doesn't even do it justice. He was 11th in the league among qualified players in TS% at 65.5% and the only guard in the top 20. The top 10 is almost exclusively 3pt specialists such as Joe Harris and MPJ or lob threats such as Gobert and Zubac.   The only player in the top 10 who could be considered a first option is KD who only played 35 games and had some of the best spacing in the league with Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving and James Harden to space the floor for him. Steph had the worst spacing in the whole league, was double, triple and even quadruple teamed and still won the scoring title on insane efficiency."
"Doubt he’s anything close to elite.   Even if he’s just Joe Harris, the Warriors are back in finals conversation though."
"Did you watch Milwaukee-BKN?  Milwaukee was barely and I mean barely able to run any offense against Brooklyn's backups, they had Blake Griffin on Giannis ffs, Jeff Green, Landry Shamet, Joe Harris, 1 legged Harden, KD who has never been anywhere near an elite defender, dude Nick Claxton who has played 47 NBA games was their #1 defender.    Bledsoe wasn't the problem &amp; they likely still win the Finals w him, this was a down year for the NBA with injuries."
Let’s not forget the joe Harris hype in this sub last year though lol
"After Kyrie got injured the Bucks went 4-1. KD didn't ""almost win the series"". He won one game.  Even if they had won Game 7, it's BS to say ""KD won the series with Joe Harris as his #2"" because he had a 2-0 to play with."
also they win if Joe harris isn't horrible.
Lmao and if Joe Harris hits wide open shots then the nets win earlier too. I can also play that game. Jrue and Kris had their moments that series and Giannis would not have won without them
"Yeah than Kyrie got injured and Harden played injured, you must have not watched the series then sadly. KD with a injured Harden, a ice cold Joe Harris and a bunch of role players is far from a valid contender and he still took a very talented bucks team to game 7, the fact they got to that point is commendable and I don’t think many other players in the nba could have stayed afloat for that long. Your letting your hate for KD overshadow one of the heroic playoff performances in history."
And Joe Harris was also #2 for the Bucks
If Joe Harris didn’t pull a Space Jam and completely forget how to play basketball the Nets probably win that series with how unbelievable KD was.
Everyone wrote them off once Harden and Kyrie got injured and KD almost won the series with Joe Harris as his #2.
"Harden has taken on a pure PG role. If you watched his games as a Net last year, you rarely saw him fishing for fouls nearly as much as he had to in Houston. He no longer needs them to keep his team in the game.  In the postgame threads, people were begging for him to take more shots during the game even if they won. With Kyrie, KD and Joe Harris as shooting options, I’d be surprised if his PPG rises above 25. His assists on the other hand are about to skyrocket."
"Nets squeaked into the Playoffs with the squad lead by D'Lo and with the core of D'Lo, Spencer, LeVert, Joe Harris, and Jarett Allen could be pencilled in for the playoffs from that point for the next several years. So they literally were a playoff team and were definitely going to be a playoff team going forward even without any free agents. But of course the Nets had the ability to open up two max contracts so they could sign very good free agents. So the plan was to add some very good players. As it turned out, Nets got hall of famers. Best case scenario.   Beside the point that you are wrong about, I'm not sure what point you are trying to make. My point is that well run teams can set themselves up to be in position to be very good by adding signing or trading for superstars. And lots of teams in the league have done this besides in LA and NYC. It is easier for LA and NYC, but not impossible for many other teams."
"bud is bad, that being said I don't think double KD was the correct call. leaving him 1 v 1 froze out alot of the rest of the Nets team offensively and i think was a major reason you saw things like Joe Harris shooting like 20% from 3."
"18-64  Ben would get his feels hurt by Kidd and sit some more.  Kyrie &amp; Beal could only play 41 games.  Kuzma would shoot and talk a lot but not make so many.  Kevin Love would old.  Joe Harris would be fine for 5-15 mins a game but after that the effects of the post game beer would wind him.  Porzingis would be hurt 1/2 to 3/4 the season if not the entire season.  So you're down to Schroder, Isaac, Gobert, Drummond, Herro and that's kinda okay except fatigue would lead to naggy injuries at best, so on a long rest or against teams ""load managing"" you'd have a chance, but otherwise you're just fully fucked."
"I can’t agree with that. That Simmons is the “ideal” fit with KD and Harden.   Defensively, they fit pretty good. They could pretty much switch everything and there’s enough quick hand and BBIQ to cause havoc.   But on offense, I just don’t think it’s a good fit.   The Nets are so dangerous because all three of the big 3 are more than capable with the ball in their hands but can also function well off ball or as a spot up shooter.   Relative to KD and Irving, Harden is the weakest (still very good but not elite) or less inclined to play off ball because he is at his best with ball in his hands.  Harden is one of the most elite playmakers in the league and probably in NBA history. The Rockets were consistently a top 3 offense just because of Harden; he was the system.  With the Nets it’s almost night/day when Harden runs the offense compared to Irving/KD.   While Simmons is good with the ball in his hands; he’s not Harden. He doesn’t command the attention/respect Harden does as both a scorer and playmaker. It would hurt the offense a lot if the ball was in Simmons’ hands than Harden’s.   And then off the ball, defenses are going to cheat off Simmons to double Harden/KD all the time.   How can you double off of KD/Irving/Harden then leave Joe Harris/shooter or roll man/big wide open?"
"I called it when they signed KD and Kyrie that they'd never win with those 2, mainly because of Kyrie. Signing Harden gave them a giant boost, as did signing all those veterans for small/min deals.   It's insane that they have Aldridge, Blake, Millsap, Patty Mills besides their big 3, plus a few other nice pieces in Joe Harris, Bruce Brown Jr, James Johnson (if he can still play ?)."
My take: Kyrie refuses to get vaccinated. Nets decide they don't want him for only away games and get KD and Harden's permission to sit him for the year. Joe Harris wins MVP averaging 39 a game on 70% from three. Yes I've been drinking.
"The way that question is worded I was expecting a few Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson responses, maybe even a Klay."
"Westbrook: 17/8/8, 54% TS  Joe Harris was bad lol, he had 32% from three and 49% TS"
Was Joe Harris trash in the finals? I have a funny feeling he was.   Also what did Russ average in the finals?   Thanks for these posts OP
"Harden/Joe Harris/KD/Blake/LMA  Bench : Patty Mills/Cam Thomas/Bruce Brown/Millsap/Claxton  With James Johnson/Jevon Carter/ Bembry/ Day'Ron Sharpe as end of bench  This team can win a ring 100%, not like they're favorite and are gonna smash teams left and right but on a good run they can"
Tony Allen Joe Harris / Duncan Robinson / etc. Jeremy Evans (Dunks) Tristan Thompson (Offensive boards)
"Except that we've lost games to those shitty teams with ben + jojo. And harris and richardson playing horrendous might have something to do with missing Ben.   The heat weren't that good but it was simmons *rookie* season with no embiid and a starting 5 of ilyasova, dario,roco, jj, ben. pretty much equal with the heat. Nets had caris, joe and jarret and plenty of  good players, they were a serious team rising through the ranks and in form. Celtics swept us, on the back of a terrible run-in to the playoffs. I would have confidently expected embiid to wipe the floor with them at least once, but guess what? he didn't. why? because his skillset does not revolve around making the players around you better, and so his impact will always be limited to his performance not just at the start of the game, but the end, and he has shown time and again he is not clutch in playoffs games. then the wizards, hot off a strong run into the play ins then playoffs, and having just beaten our full strength team, again ben gets the win without embiid.   You cannot say embiid would have gotten the wins against the other teams, because embiid didn't get a single win with 4 attempts at the same team. blame harris and JR all you want, but the fact is our full strenth team was better each of those years than the celtics in 2019/20 and we got beaten at least once in the first round each time.  the only time there is a sweeping is when ben is out, and it was against us."
Harrison Barnes? edit: Joe Harris is a better for for the Nets starting 5
"They're both better than Joe Harris, so that still works for the question"
Maybe the Nets then.  I'll take Joe Harris to fit with Kyrie and Harden over Brodgon
KD dropping 40+ is not the reason Joe Harris missed wide open shots
You're blaming Joe harris for KD missing shots and not being able to defend? What?
the reason the Bucks beat the Nets is cause 2 of their 3 best players got injured and Joe Harris couldn't hit an open shot lol. there is no reason it should've gone to 7 other than KD being godly
"&gt; if Joe Harris doesn't shoot below 30% from 3, they beat the Bucks  Why is it only Joe Harris who gets to have a hypothetical bump? Bucks were the 4th best 3PT shooting team in the regular season, and didn't have a player hit from 3 better than Blake Griffin."
"Giannis ain't better. Despite losing both Harden and Kyrie, if Joe Harris doesn't shoot below 30% from 3, they beat the Bucks spear headed by KD's efforts.    &gt;Curry is better than Lebron right now  No shot. Curry got outdueled by Ja Morant lmao"
"Your fear is exactly how establishment candidates stay in power. ""But the other side was so close!"" Maybe because Joe Biden is a segregationist dementia patient who hates universal healthcare and Kamala Harris is an incredibly unpopular soulless vapid token personality with direct corporate ties."
Kd alone took you guys two 5 games. Steph is better than kyrie in pretty much every aspect so add him back for the full series and your golden. specially with klay who is joe harris but good and can defend and then theres draymond who is a much better defender than anyone on the nets rn. 2017 warriors is an upgrade in every regard
"KD absolutely is a better shooter lmao. taking much harder shots at like twice the volume, is 1% lower than porter's 40% post-okc. stop it. this is like saying joe harris is a better shooter than steph."
"I feel like Kevin Durant almost single handedly beat the bucks last year, and that's with Joe Harris taking a trip to Brick City for the week. So I feel like it's a bit harsh to criticize KD. I feel like his playoff performance showed why he's the best in the world.   I think Harden has more to prove in that regard"
Having Klay on the current Nets would negate the need for Joe Harris too which means the $18m per year on Harris can be spent on a different type of player.
"True, it's pretty close tbh. I say Nets are more stacked because they've got 3 players with top 10 talent plus Joe Harris shooting almost 45 percent from deep  sidenote: I kinda hate Kyrie since he carries himself like a smug 12 year old, and he's definitely not close to my top 10, but dude definitely has the skill to be top 10"
It's just sad in this case because like I said this simulation wasn't even remotely about Joe Harris  I just clicked on his stats after the Nets lost because Kyrie and Harden didn't really seem to underperform too much and guess what I found lol
"Joe Harris:  ""What a lovely day! I think I'll check Reddit to see what's happening!   Oh no.... Oh nooo"""
The hilarious part about this is that it wasn't supposed to be about Joe Harris at all  But he ended up selling another series for the second year in a row
"How? Simmons is a non-shooting point guard with elite defense and little offensive abilities outside of getting to the rim.   He’d literally provide zero value for us on offense and actually make us worse offensively since opponents have someone they can essentially ignore.   His defense would be great, but the lack of offense hurts and there’s zero shot he’d be happy being the 5th offensive option that doesn’t carry the ball up the court or even be asked to actively dribble.  Plus there’s no shot we could play him late in 4th quarters since fouling Simmons is 100% smarter than giving KD harden and Joe Harris an offensive possession"
&gt; Would be kind of redundant with Joe Harris though. I would probably move Harris to the bench in that case.  No way. Have them on opposite wings. That would be perfect
With his defense absolutely. Would be kind of redundant with Joe Harris though. I would probably move Harris to the bench in that case.
"if it was so easy then teams like the magic, kings, knicks wouldnt suck for so long. its ok i realize ur a hater. no team has rebuilt the way the nets did with virtually no talent on the team. and then the fact the nets developed guys like dinwiddie and joe harris from nothing. while hitting well on late picks like allen and levert.   Theres a reason that marks has been viewed as a top gm for the last few years."
"Great point about Blake and LMA damn. No team can run with 100% healthy Kyrie/Harden/KD/Blake/LMA with Joe Harris sixth man, plus Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, Paul Millsap off the bench. Cam Thomas looks good too"
"Probably yes, their defense was great vs the Bucks, but it was partly because they replaced Harden and then Kyrie's mins with Bruce Brown who is a great defender.  Also the Bucks had their annual ""hey we are a great shooting team all year but we'll never ever make open shots in the playoffs"", and it's not out of the question that now that they've won a ring this mental block goes away.  Also having 0 rim protection and a best wing defender who is 6'3 would be a problem against the Lakers or Clippers in an eventual NBA finals.  The thing is it wouldn't be surprising if they had a 120 offensive rating even against a defense like the Bucks if their trio is healthy and if Joe Harris doesn't randomly can't make open shots, so it might not even matter"
Terry Rozier  Duncan Robinson  Joe Harris  Ben Simmons  Myles Turner
"Can you really blame him tho. The longer you play your efficiency wears down, and after Love &amp; Kyrie went down, he had a lot of weight to carry. I'd rather have Bron brick shots than sitting on the bench or having Smith handle the ball.  Side note: looking back at that series, and I find out Joe Harris played for that Cavs team... WUT THE FUCK!? I didnt even know he existed back then lol"
Yo why you hating on Joe Harris
"Realistically, I feel like he might come back around the level of Joe Harris, maybe just slightly better defense. If you forced me to choose right now I would take prime JJ Reddick over him for sure."
"Some of you guys say the most baseless shit lol. How many white players are talked about here that aren't for memes? Luka and Jokic?  Caruso is a meme, Grayson Allen is definitely disliked if he's mentioned, Kristaps isn't too popular from what I've seen. Luka is like the only non-meme white player that is more liked than disliked from what I've seen, if they're even talked about at all. I'm on here a lot too.  No one is making Kevin Huerter posts, or mentioning Joe Harris for anything other than shooting. Vucevic is barely even mentioned and he's a top 5 offensive center."
"I mean Kyrie is obviously better, but in the scenario where he'd a massive distraction I don't think that's the worse trade for both sides. KD + Harden is an overwhelming amount of offense regardless, I don't think surrounding them with Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and a defensive player of the year candidate is the worst thing to do."
"I watched every Celtic game last year. Smart isn’t a top playmaker in the NBA by any means, but he’s a good decision maker who makes good passes, which is what I consider to be a good playmaker. He’ll probably average 7 assists per game this year. The problem with Smart is he has always been yanked between different roles on the team. He’s a natural point guard who has had to operate more as a spot up shooter and bail out scorer (which he struggles with) since he’s always played with a ball dominant point guard (Rondo, IT, Kyrie, Kemba). There was a stat last year that showed that when he and the Jays were on the floor with Smart playing at the point without Kemba, his assist numbers skyrocketed and the team’s efficiency as a whole improved.   The issue has always been that he can take bad shots when he plays off ball, since he’s often non afraid to take bail out shots with the clock running down. He also can start feeling himself and shoot a team in or out of a game. When he’s focused on a point guard role, he doesn’t take nearly as many of those shots.   Smart isn’t a top guard in the league by any stretch of the imagination, but calling him a “glorified backup PG” is just wrong and insulting. Every single team in the league would plug him in as a starter instantly, even Brooklyn would play him in the Joe Harris minutes instead."
Not quite but Joe Harris does weigh more than Jordan did for most of his career.
Joe Harris weighs more than Bill Russell did
"not joe harris, that’s for sure"
Are u saying that Luka is a good shooter or not cause he’s an amazing one  Y’all gotta understand that these guys would be ridiculous if they played like Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson all game and only shot open catch and shoot 3s instead of creating
"More than that...harden, kyrie and dinwiddie...and Joe harris"
Playoff Joe Harris
"&gt; I don't know about you, but I'll take a 20% increase in volume over a 2% increase in shooting percentage lol.  And I know you would too - there's a reason we don't consider Joe Harris or Steve Kerr  Right… the guy who owns the majority of the top 10 seasons with most made 3s doesn’t have enough volume. I know you’re a Dame Stan but comparing Curry to Kerr and Joe Harris is wild lol. Also it’s a 3% increase in percentage in 2020 and over 10% in 2021.   &gt; 2021 is not between 2010 and 2021 my man. Steph made 61 3s from 30-39 feet in the 699 games he played from 2010 until 2020. Dame made 54 in just 66 games in 2020 (aka, he was on pace to make more in a single year than Curry ever had...but then the lockout took away 10 games).   Not gonna fact check these but you’ve fudged the numbers a bunch of times to favour Dame. You said Dame made more deep 3s in 2020 than Curry had in his career before 2021 which is not true. Also curious about how many Dame made in his career prior to 2020, I assume it’s close to total from 2020. 2020 is an outlier for Dame, for the majority of his career Dame he’s below 35% between 30-39 ft."
"  [Here you go man. 53/125 = 42.4%](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203081/shooting/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season). Straight from NBA.com as well (though it looks like they took away one 3 since I last checked, cause it was definitely 54 lol. I know, since I made a post about it when it happened last year).  &gt;Curry made 41 (in 63 games) just last season and combining it with pretty much any other healthy Curry season gets over 53.  2021 is not between 2010 and 2021 my man. Steph made 61 3s from 30-39 feet in the 699 games he played from 2010 until 2020. Dame made 54 in just 66 games in 2020 (aka, he was on pace to make more in a single year than Curry ever had...but then the lockout took away 10 games).  Curry went 41/90 (45.5%) in 63 games last season. I don't know about you, but I'll take a 20% increase in volume over a 2% increase in shooting percentage lol. And I know you would too - there's a reason we don't consider Joe Harris or Steve Kerr or someone the best 3 point shooter in NBA history. It's the volume-percentage combo."
Joe Harris
"Hmmm so you literally have a set of morris twins and going to the 6 man which is Tyler Herro, you'll receive Joe Harris. Harris and Duncan are trouble."
"I can see it happening, unfortunately. I remember a few years ago when there were barely any comments under our Social Media posts. Now it's all filled with bandwagon fans trying to get likes by commenting some form of ""trade that bum Joe Harris"" under every post.. it's so annoying."
Joe Harris
How does anyone know if buddy Hield wouldn’t just be joe harris in the playoffs
Defense is not more important than shooting. Look at the contracts guys like Joe Harris get vs guys like Andre Roberson
"Nice try, but it was 1 superstar + a great team that beat the Hawks without him vs 1 superstar with Joe Harris as his second option. It's how Lebron was by far the best player in the 2018 finals and still got swept."
The Nets best lineups will have him on the court. Joe Harris is not good against better defenses
Pat is a sniper. Cheaper joe Harris.
"Joe Harris and Blake Griffin are starters. So unless Nash plans on playing only 6 guys every game, then he’s gonna have a problem (when Durant and/or Harden are not playing well)."
"Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, and Joe Harris are great role players."
Very common name. He could easily be another Joe Harris right now.
why does joe harris look like he's not joe harris? he's a joe harris impersonator or some shit
Please tell me why I bothered drafting Joe Harris in fantasy 😭😭😭
joe harris is pathetic
"I agree with you, but our team really had no picks or leverage whatsoever after the Pierce/Garnett trade, it was only a miracle that we got the misfit gems like D'Angelo Russell, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, then got late guys like LeVert and Allen  As much as it pains me to say, I don't see that team being serious contenders even at all of their peaks...the Nets may have sold their soul to the devil but were *historically* bad in the early-mid 2010s"
How much money Joe Harris making this year?
joe harris can’t pass for shit
Bruh Joe Harris is selling.
i see joe harris still cant make anything in Milwaukee
What the hell happened to Joe Harris
Impeach Joe Harris
After the Olympics you start Joe Harris who lost the nets the finals over patty mills   Put Harden SG Mills runs point. Giannis too good.
Why does Joe Harris think he should penetrate the paint?
Holy fuck Joe Harris hit a shot
Joe Harris is still missing shots? Smhhhh
"Joe Harris was tearing it up in the preseason, this is disappointing"
Joe Harris already in mid playoffs form I see lol
Joe Harris is a waste of a roster spot. You can find a dude at your local Y who balls harder...no cap
Joe Harris looks horrible. He looks out of shape almost
Playoff Joe Harris is back
Joe Harris makes 18M a year.
"Bro what is Joe Harris doin out there, just shoot the ball man you arent here to playmake"
"I drafted Joe Harris late, need this mf to do something"
Joe Harris in playoff form already
Joe Harris is the worst shooter in the NBA with the green light to shoot
Joe Harris is booty
Joe Harris is not good against the bucks
Joe Harris is a walking brick.
I see Joe Harris is picking up right where he left off
Someone remind Joe Harris that its not playoffs anymore
I cannot remember the last time Joe Harris did something positive offensively.
Joe Harris a fake nice shooter
Joe Harris is back
Joe Harris in post season form so far
joe harris giving me mychal mulder vibes lmao
I’m going to blow my brains out if I see Joe Harris drive the ball again.
Joe Harris just here doing cardio today
Joe Harris getting paid 18mil to do cardio out there
Patty Mills has never gotten open shots like Joe harris does regularly  Let's go Patty
So is Harden gonna shoot or is he going to be as passive as last season.    Cause we can't afford it anymore with Kyrie gone and Joe Harris' playoff performances.
Joe Harris seeing Bucks colors makes him go cold
Joe Harris still cant hit a jump shot my god hes gotta be the worst starter in the league
Joe Harris should get benched for passing up that 3 for a pull up 2 that was even more contested
Joe Harris revenge game
"Why does that matter? LeBron is a superstar, obviously he’ll have more attempts than a role player.  Do you think he’s a better shooter than KD? Or Joe Harris? Or Bryn Forbes? Or he’ll, even Wayne Ellington?"
An under-talked about play is how Joe Harris inexplicably lost his balance and gave Jrue the lane for a game winning layup in like game 3 - it changed everything.
Joe Harris 15 threes
One of my favorite parts of Nets games is watching the opposing team frantically try and get Joe Harris switched onto the ball in the 4th quarter.
"maybe I just remember shamet's rookie year too fondly but I already thought that contract was fine and now it seems pretty good. Shooters take time to develop. JJ Redick, Joe Harris, &amp; Duncan Robinson were all in their mid to late 20s when they broke out. Even Paul George who was obviously a far better and just different player didn't really break out as a movement shooting until 5 or 6 years in the league."
"If Joe Harris pulls a Nick Anderson, that dude is going to be on a wanted list in Brooklyn."
It's hilarious because this simulation is like it was done by a Twitter troll or something  DeRozan playing terrible in the playoffs again  Mavericks losing to the Clippers and Kawhi again  Joe Harris being the reason the Nets lose again  Westbrook shooting 29% in the Finals
basketball gm fucking despises joe harris
"Scratch Space Jam, he straight up pulled a 2019, 2020 Giannis, he forgot how to play. Scratch the threes, all those missed open mid ranges still look the craziest to me considering they were shot by Joe, especially the one would-be dagger in Game 7. Only prime Curry with Draymond losing to Ja Morant shocked me more (and of course all the injuries news day after day).  The craziest part is that all of that injuries, Joe Harris etc package still required 7 Games going from comatose to alive (against just KD almost having the 2015 Cavs around him) + OT (and still needing to have KD behaving like KD in OT, feeling hero ball and shooting his team out, instead of playing the right way and winning a-la Lebron, MJ etc), but especially all of this even made possible by KD's series winning shot being ruled out a two to begin with, and, for Giannis himself, requiring Khris and jrue absolutely clutching and tearing it up on offense and defense in crunch time of Game 7.   Like wtf? How many more things are required for a favourite Bucks Big 3 to win that series, to then get their ring vs the counterparts of the ECF and Finals New Jersey Nets but with Jason Kidd injured? What kind of Wilt-esque record would the Lebron 2013 Heat and Jordan 90s Bulls pull in the 2021 playoffs and vs the Bucks?  What there is to do in the game of basketball anymore to represent the concept of ''escaping'', ''asterisk'', ''not proving yourself legitimate''? The Warriors at least played amazing and had great competition and adversities.  And all from 0 to 100, nobody in the history of the game managed to pull this stuff lol"
Or if Joe Harris didn't get his talents taken by the Goon Squad
I'm surprised he didn't get more minutes on Game 7 against the Bucks while Joe Harris was bricking those open 3s
Joe Harris is a good defender
"Actually I think players are worth it just for being high level shooters.  Davis Bertans and Joe Harris got around $80m and they are basically OTP's.     And regardless, Jaren doesn't stink on defense, nor does he have to play Center.  He most likely will always be a part-time wing.  Defensively he has a fouling problem, and that's pretty much the extent of it.  Many eventually great defenders had comparable foul rates when they were young (Tyson Chandler, Draymond Green, Ron Artest).  It's not reasonable to expect that to continue."
"That’s exactly the stereotype. If their shot doesn’t fall he’s complete ass because he isn’t a good defender. Bryn Forbes, JJ Redick, Joe Harris, Korver all fall under the stereotype."
"97 Jazz  PG: Chris Paul (John Stockton)  SG: Joe Harris (Jeff Hornacek)  SF: Royce O’neale (Bryon Russell)  PF: Anthony Davis (Karl Malone)  C: Bismack Biyimbo (Greg Ostertag)  Center was the hardest position to make a comp for because there’s just not a center in the league today as offensively inept as Ostertag, even if 97 was by far his best offensive season (7.3 ppg on 51% from the field)."
"[he didn't even shoot 32% from the 3 in the playoffs last year you clown, he shot 38%](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/shamela01.html)  and no shit he'll shoot a different 3% percentage in the playoffs than he did in regular season it's an inherently high variance shot on a way smaller sample size, he'd need to shoot like 500 3PA to get an accurate number. it's why Joe Harris looks like a bum in the playoffs despite everyone agreeing he's an elite 3 point shooter"
This the contract Duncan Robinson and Joe Harris deserved
"PG: Simmons  SG: Curry  SF: Green  PF: Harris  C: Embiid  Bench: Maxey, Milton, Korkmaz, Niang, Drummond.   I really hope Isaiah Joe ends up getting Korkmaz’s minutes though."
"Simmons (LOL), Maxey  Curry, Shake Milton over Isaiah Joe b/c Doc is Doc  Green, Korkmaz/Thybulle  Harris, Niang  Drummond, Embiid"
Game 3 pissed me off the most. Both teams played horribly. Thought it was in the bag when KD hit the 3 to make it 83-80 with a minute or so left  bumbling ass goons joe harris and bruce brown
I think the underrated part about this series is that pretty much only Giannis and KD showed up offensively   Middleton had 52.2% TS   Holiday had 42.8%(wtf) TS  They combined for 14/49 in game 7  Kyrie had 52.0% TS in the games he played   Injured Harden had 49%  Joe Harris had 46%  They combined for 10/48 in games 5 and 7
"Yes, we can see on a lot of teams how often they have to field bad shooters to cover up for 3-pt specialists that cannot defend. True 3&amp;Ds are the 2nd tier of every offseason (only behind superstars wanting a trade), and, being a little bit of a homer, the reason why I was happy with our offseason.   Models change, but, right now, the ideal model of a team is one court general playing point, 1 guy that can create off the dribble and be an all-around shooter, 2 3&amp;D wings and one C that can stretch the court and set screens. This model should remain more or less the same, but maybe in 8-10 years we'll see a run for those wings being able to shoot on high efficiency all-around.   Point is, the lack of defense for perimeter specialists was indeed the catalyst for that zagging, I can agree. They could be exploited and, if having a cold series (like Joe Harris), they are useless. It will be fun to see the profile of playoff teams this season, but I think only the Warriors of the major contenders are deeply reliant of 3s. Nets, Bucks, Bulls, Lakers, Jazz, Nuggets, us, Sixers, all of them have paint threats and have mid-range plays."
"Dude I just replied to that 7 year old thread before seen the dates, lol. Here I was wondering why they used 2012 as a cutoff year.   2014 obviously has to be included because of Jokic:   Jokic, Joe Harris, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jordan Clarkson."
"2014 2nd Round had Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Jerami Grant, Jokic, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
Beat Okc when Kd had Westbrook and Roberson on the wing making Bob the builder proud. He ain’t exactly playing with those caliber of shooters in Brooklyn anymore. Even Joe Harris with his family held for ransom again is enough to put them over a team like Gsw.
"Joe Harris got 4/75, so this seems even better compared to that"
"I'm talking about Joe Harris, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Blake Griffin. Kd has had the best spacing on any superstar player ever."
Joe Harris
would Joe Harris count?  feels a little wrong calling a guy who makes $17M a roll player though.
Joe Harris disappears in the play offs man. He was so bad against the Bucks.
Joe Harris absolutely is more important to the nets than any of those old dudes today
"Well yeah Atlanta had Bog, Capela, and Collins. Griffin and Joe Harris can't make up for the depth Atlanta has."
"Plus all the assists he'll get from passing to KD, Joe Harris, and Patty Mills on the perimeter. Gonna be a lot of W's in fantasy lol"
How you forget Joe Harris? Well if he shows up…
"Nets aren't literally the best team ever assembled though, they're christened by public opinion. What have they actually done besides having big names with a lot of wear and tear on them? Someone getting hurt again isn't out of the possibility, and joe harris disappearing isn't a valid excuse.   I don't like when 'potential' overrides results. That's all I mean."
"It’s not about pressure. Y’all struggled against a Nets team where Kyrie went out, harden got rushed back on a Grade 2 hamstring, Joe Harris disappeared, KD playing 48+ minutes and **still** barely escaped that series. Bucks then proceeded to win the title in 6 games each of the remaining series even when Giannis himself got hurt. The “pressure” was facing a superior Nets team.   And Until seen otherwise, Nets undoubtedly remain a much superior team with or without Kyrie. Bucks just barely squeaked by KD and the Hospital Nets."
"Kevin love was all nba and Kyrie was an all star the season before Lebron came back to the cavs. Without Kyrie, Who’s the third best player on the Nets that was all nba/all star? Blake Griffin? Lamarcus Aldridge? Patty mills? Joe Harris? Lol  Duos are not superteams. KD/Harden and good role players is an even playing field with Kawhi/PG or Lebron/AD without Westbrook."
Nah their 3rd best player is like Joe Harris or Blake Griffin  They're as much of a superteam as the 2020 Lakers
"Dude no, completely wrong. This change just makes the 3 pointer less valuable. Joe Harris becomes an infinitely worse player than he was before  This would bring back the mid a huge amount. Teams would still be taking wide open 3s. They just wouldn't abandon the mid. They're not gonna suddenly take all post ups  37.5% from 3 isn't some crazy number. Lots of guys can hit that if they're open. They'd still take take to space the floor"
&gt; Joe Harris forgetting how to shoot wasn't?   Have you seen him in the playoffs?  Not that I totally agree with the other guy.

"You really think they could have paid Allen after paying KD, Harden, Kyrie and Joe Harris?"
Only because of Jeff Green? So Jeff Green making some threes was a fluke but Joe Harris forgetting how to shoot wasn't? By that logic I can just say the only reason tu Bucks won game 4 and 7 was because of Joe Harris. That's some confirmation bias right there. Kyrie went down in the second quarter of a 2 point game in game 4
If the Nets get this version of Joe Harris in the playoffs they will win the title
lol Joe Harris is literally on fire
"I know YTTV's picture quality is a little different between the Apple TV 4K and the PS5, but what the hell is going on with Joe Harris?"
Is Joe Harris melting?
"* PG: Seth Curry, Jordan Clarkson * SG: Buddy Hield, Terry Rozier * SF: Malik Beasley, Duncan Robinson * PF: Davis Bertans, Joe Harris * C: Karl Anthony-Towns, Kelly Olynyk  77% chance at playoffs (projected record of 47-35), 2% chance at a title"
"To echo Steve Nash, who is taking that 3rd spot on Brooklyn. Will it be Patty Mills/Joe Harris? Or maybe one of the vets?   Personally I could see it being Mills because he has so much experience and he’s a good scorer. That kinda fits what Kyrie was doing as a scoring option for the team. Patty obviously isn’t the player that Kyrie is but he could definitely come in and get open buckets from Harden and KD’s gravity."
"Seems like a pointless question, you literally listed the reasons why he's in the MVP conversation. Keep in mind he's doing all this without Kyrie/Kyrie drama + a Joe Harris/James Harden who aren't playing like their normal selves albeit, they did change the basketball and I think I read somewhere that shooting percentages league wide is down because of the basketball switch, but still even with that, KD is still shooting well and was still a 3rd until last night. With Kyrie I think this team is easily a Top 2 seed in the East."
What happened to joe Harris man
LeBron has more career assists to Joe Harris than Kyrie has this season.
Totally forgot lebron played with Joe Harris
"""same thing happened in the playoffs last year""  Who was he supposed to pass to? Harden on one leg? Joe Harris who choked hard all series?"
"Joe Harris has low key been pulling some shit this game, glad they're calling it now"
That's exactly what I'm seeing here lol  People are leaving JOE HARRIS open at the three point line instead of letting KD 1v1
"When you are seeing *joe harris* regularly wide open, and you don't think the guys drawing defense have gravity, idk man"
Shoot the ball and nothing else Joe Harris!!!  FFS
Yo Joe Harris is ass.
SLEEPY JOE HARRIS COULD NEVER SHOOT AS WELL AS AWAKENED AYO! SAD!
Joe Harris looking like he should be in Karate Kid
"This is a pretty stupid post considering we're barely 10 games in. Cool he's having a better year than those guys but I doubt he keeps it up (for most, not all).    Allen will cool down/take less shots as the year goes on. His contract is fair, not an over/under pay.  I would rather have Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, Bogdan and Mann on their respective contracts than Allen.   Kennard's contract kinda sucks, Derrick White's is meh and Shamet's is fair but give me Allen."
"His contract is a steal now. 64/4 for Kennard. 90/5 for Duncan Robinson, 80/5 for Davis Bertans, and 75/4 for Joe Harris."
Joe harris and blake take charges and do a hard hat celebration hence the nickname
"Luke's contract is looking like a bargain with Duncan Robinson, Davis Bertans and Joe Harris getting 90 mil+ contracts. what great foresight to lock up Luke by the Lawrence Frank"
"Not saying those aren’t true, but it did feel like the more blatant missed calls were on our side today. Also not even counting that phantom offensive foul call on joe Harris at the end of the game.   Regardless I do agree that in the first half the whistle was super non existent. Then in the second half they started calling some more fouls and I think that threw the raps off a bit.   Overall I’m a fan of the new officiating but it just feels so inconsistent. I actually don’t mind when they call harden for his normal antics. He’s mostly stopped as a result, he used to kick his feet out on every three and now doesn’t. But I do think they’re just missing calls on him virtually every game at this point."
"what do you guys have to complain about? genuinely curious not hating. refs missed clear foul on harden, then called a bad foul on durant that turned into 3 points, then called a bad foul on joe harris for 3 more points.   What did they miss on our side?"
"Aldridge is currently a mid range God, Patty is shooting like Crazy and Joe Harris seems to be back"
"The YES Broadcast is real uneven, did anyone see that dumb yellow arrow to point out where Joe Harris was when he shot the three?  Thank god for that."
"I don't think Joe Harris can pull off ""Joey Buckets"" as a nickname."
Yeah not a fan of that call on Joe Harris
[Svi vs Joe Harris](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)
"Bruh did you watch the playoffs last year? He was unstoppable but it wasn’t like he was gonna score 60 points a game to carry the nets starting five of Blake Griffin, James Harden, Joe Harris, and Bruce Brown."
"Even Joe Harris is yelling: ""What are you doing?!"" lmao"
"No Kyrie, Harden playing like shit on both ends, Joe Harris still in that playoff shooting drought, having to rely on washed Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge to pick up the slack offensively to fill out numbers. Yeah.... KD irritates me but so far it's really hard to argue MVP right now. Especially when all other potential candidates are slacking behind like Luka, Trae, LeBron. Only one close to him is Steph who is playing the best defense of his career early on so far.  Edit: Forgot Jimmy Butler. He's deserving of some consideration."
Joe Harris does not think brain farts are funny
I love Joe Harris' reaction
lol Joe Harris reaction on the replay
joe harris is disappointment given human form
"Except it creates a lot of pressure on the defense. Every game Durant creates with the simple pin down. Last game we had whoever Trae was guarding set the screen so Trae can’t contest durants shot. Then they either double and Durant found joe Harris for a wide open 3, or Durant just rises over him.   It’s good consistent offense all the time. Also when we do it with Bruce brown he slips to the basket for layups all the time. Golden state did it as well like that. He’s not curry but he is one of the best off ball superstars in the league."
That’s Joe Harris.
And Cavs fans still love Smokin' Joe Harris!
More than half of his shots are 2’s. He takes plenty of them. He’s just not that good at them. If he took fewer 2’s his efficiency would be better. Joe Harris for example is at 63 TS% over the last 5 years taking more 3’s than 2’s.
"UVA was repped hard tonight between Hunter and Joe Harris!   I think Hunter's number should've been called more, dude was hitting shots over Kevin Durant and easily blew by Blake Griffin, the Nets played well defensively tonight but nobody on the team had an answer on this guy"
Joe Harris has a better drive game than Redick or Korver ever did imo
Who else think that joe Harris becomes non threatening the moment he puts the ball on the floor rather than catch and shoot?
Joe Harris has the body of a retired NFL quarterback
"Joe Harris was actually playing like shit so teams would leave him open, you guys wouldn't get it"
Joe Harris is back
"This is the best Joe Harris has looked in months, I hope I'm not jinxing it"
Not sure if I’m a fan of the plan of leaving Joe Harris wide open
Joe Harris looks like an extra from Semi Pro
Joe Harris needs to cut that hair.
"Well I traded Tatum who was destroying my FG% for AD. My complete team is LeBron, AD, Ja, Kyrie, Rob Williams, Jalen Suggs, Pat Mills, Joe Harris, Nerlens Noel, Mobley, and DeAndre Hunter"
Why do the Nets run so many players for role players not named Joe Harris  Blake and Bruce miss every three
joe harris+ for myles turner
Knowing Joe Harris that isn't a guarantee
"Harden is starting to get a bit better, but Steve Nash continues his questionable rotations. It’s fine at this stage of the year, but I’d like to see a more consistent line up going into December.   DeAndre Bembry is looking like a good addition, though with Carter and Brown idk how we’ll be splitting the defensive guard minutes. Whenever Kyrie decides to get vaxxed we’ll see how the rotations end up.   Joe Harris has lost it, but thankfully Patty Mills has been picking up the slack for it. I don’t necessarily regret giving him the money, but he something is definitely off with him.   The team still needs a big man who can rebound, it’s been a glaring weakness for a couple years and I hope this is the thing they address closer to the trade deadline. I don’t know who is for sale, but I think that’s the necessary piece to put this team into a better spot (and getting Kyrie back for more scoring of course)."
His drives piss me off in the same way Joe Harris drives piss me off tho
Joe Harris technically if you count 2015-16 team lol
"Nah… not quite Joe Harris money, but a bit under. Harris plays defense. Seth was getting exploited in the playoffs by Huerter lmao. But honestly, that blame could go to Doc for putting him in that position.   Question: Who’s better, Seth or THJ?"
He’s under paid but he shouldn’t be making Joe Harris money. Harris is passable defensively. Curry is Trae Young/Kemba Walker bad on defense. He can’t defend a traffic cone and it becomes a real issue in the playoffs.
"His contract is such a steal.  $8.2M this year, $8.5 next year.  He should be making Joe Harris money."
"Westbrook with a 13PER, 5.7TO/game, and 20.8% from 3 with only 1.8FTM/game.  Honorable mentions to Lowry with the 8.4 PPG and 11.5PER, Saints Offensive Lineman Zion Williamson, and Joe Harris with a 4.9PER, shooting 33% from the field"
"It’s funny how people ignore this fact   We’ll probably just get downvoted without anyone actually commenting otherwise   Durant’s foot was literally an inch too close from winning the series. That’s without Kyrie, with Harden who visibly could barely move and Joe Harris choking on Harrison Barnes levels"
"The real question is should the Nets have traded Joe Harris and kept either Dinwiddie or LeVert.   I’ve always been a big fan of Harris especially since his Harris #12 can be used as a throwback Lucious Harris jersey since they’re both #12. But if he isn’t hitting 3pt shots he’s become pretty useless.   He’s not a great defender and for whatever reason it seems like he’s regressed a bit. He used to be able to get to the rim fairly consistently and hit his midrange even when he didn’t have Durant, Kyrie, and Harden creating space with their gravity.   Maybe it’s just the scheme w/ how the offense is being run now vs the past. Could easily be a case of the Nets needing Harris to do too much with Kyrie out.   With Dinwiddie or LeVert at least they were able to initiate the offense and handle the ball as well as shoot it fairly well. Harris offers so much less than someone like Seth Curry who makes $9m less than him."
Like a Great Value brand Joe Harris
"The Nets when Kyrie went down weren’t trash at all. It’s just that key guys played like trash in the Bucks after Kyrie’s injury. The infamous Joe Harris choke, then Harden not even being able to run a fastbreak due to injury, and the fact that the bench put up 0 shots in Game 7. Not make 0 shots, they shot 0 times. Of course players like Blake and Bruce Brown played well, and Jeff Green popped off in Game 5, but Milwaukee were just deeper once Kyrie went down. The Bucks could play guys like Connaughton and he provided for them in Game 7. Their starting lineup of Middleton, Holiday, Giannis, Tucker, and Lopez were also more consistent than the Net’s starting lineup barring Kd."
"Lol what, of course he’s a starter, I never claimed otherwise. He’s nowhere near an All Star though. What the fuck are you talking about? You’re bringing up All Stars in 2013 like that shit matters but apparently now you’re worried about current ability? Because on current ability, Khris Middleton is the one and only other All Star on the Bucks and has been for Giannis’ entire tenure.  Giannis lead the team in 4th quarter points by a huge margin, Jrue wasn’t responsible for closing at all. Middleton did, especially in that game 7 (13 points on 5/10 in the 4th/OT to Giannis’ 9 points on 4/5, take your pick I guess) but if he’d not shot **4/16** in the first three quarters we wouldn’t have needed a closer. As for defence, not so much against the Nets. Once Kyrie went down it was KD vs. the world, and PJ was on him. Jrue was mostly guarding crippled Harden and Khris was mostly guarding guys like Jeff Green and Joe Harris. Jrue’s defence was big in the ECF and Finals for sure, not so much the first two rounds."
"When your role is pretty much just playing defense and not messing up, athleticism is pretty important. Maybe idk what you mean by impact, but Caruso impacts the game by being one of the best defensive wings in the league and by essentially never making mistakes on either end. Reaves can probably get to the point where he can mitigate mistakes, but he is not going to make as big as an impact on defense because he lacks the athleticism to be a game changer on that end. So in order for him to make “as big of an impact” as Caruso he’s going to have to become as good as Caruso is on defense, but on the offensive end. That’s a severe long shot. That player is essentially Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris.   Also Luka, Nash, and Dirk didn’t and don’t impact games as much as LeBron. And the reasoning is mostly athleticism lol. It’s kind of the exact same argument with higher tier players. They all lacked the athleticism to change games defensively, which lowered their overall impact. There’s a reason 90% of the top 10 were athletic freaks and anomalies."
"Curry has the record for most games with 4+, 5+, 6+, 7+, 8+, 9+, 10+, 11+, and 12+ three-pointers made. Most of this while being doubled either at halfcourt or when he doesn't have the ball.   There are six players ahead of Steph in career 3-point percentage. The next closest to him in career makes is Joe Harris, who still has 2000 fewer 3-pointers made. Curry is doing this while taking 8.6 attempts per game, which is in it's own orbit for everybody with a long-ish career except Klay, who is still 1.6 attempts behind and gets to play with Curry.  The only other player near him is Duncan Robinson, who has played just over three seasons.  Curry is different."
"Joe Harris should’ve put up a shot, dude needs that practice"
"Another outstanding win. I still have my reservations. Our 3-ball has been piss poor. If we were 1-4 instead of 4-1, I'm pretty sure Duncan and Lowry would be  piñata's in our sub. Dunc's is understandable, *every* team that pays their 3pt specialist will get frustrated with them on an off night(BKN - Joe Harris, WAS - Davis Bertans, etc...)   But I hope Lowry gets going eventually. He hasn't scored 10pts in a game for us yet. Kinda reminds me of Mike Conley's woeful start with Utah a few years back. At least he can contribute in other aspects.   Regardless, Bam's a rebounding machine, Herro is an electric scorer off the bench, and I love Markieff Morris."
steve nash loves joe harris a little too much
"Joe Harris cant defend, dribble, pass or set a screen and now he can't even shoot the fucking ball smh"
It'd be cool if a player wears juggalo face paint during a game on Halloween this year. Looking at you Joe Harris.
Joe Harris is the worst ball handler I've ever seen
Joe Harris is being payed 20 million USD dollars to waste Kevin Durant's time
joe harris is wildin
Nets fans what the hell happened to Joe Harris?
"this is 'Joe Harris in the 2019 FIBAs' erasure, let's respect his true nadir"
Joe Harris is still shook from the Bucks series lol
Joe Harris is a great player but man he’s gotta be one of the worst inbounders of all time
Joe Harris is inexplicably the worst inbounder of all-time
Joe Harris shooting like Westbrook vs Bucks 2nd Round
People treat comments on this sub like shots fired all the damn time when it's just a discussion.  It's so annoying- even worse when fans take a critique personally and go on downvote crusades against comments they don't like.    Take a deep breath and just read.  This isn't a 'what if'.  This thread was clearly about how pressure affects performance.  Joe Harris buckled in a *really* profound way.
I love how people reference instances where the warriors were at the their peak lmao. Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson can shoot the hell out of the ball but they can still MOVE without any inhibitions.
Joe Harris is only on NBA rosters because he hits 3's consistently.  That's his only job and he completely buckled under the pressure.
"Blows my mind people think shooting is the lakers only weakness lol watching Caruso, Kcp and tht unable to even get the ball up court last year was god awful. We could have had prime klay and dirk on the team and it wouldn’t have mattered because we couldn’t even get someone to dribble up the court consistently without lebron. Buddy would be a good fit for lebron at least in the regular season (we have zero idea how he will shoot against playoff defense. He might end up like Joe harris or bertans last year), but it’s far more valuable to get someone to let lebron rest and not lose all your games in the meantime    The lakers won a game and almost won the second game of a back to back with no lebron. Last year that would have been a guaranteed loss. We are only 5 games in and have shown the lakers can win games against mediocre or bad teams with no lebron which is all they need to do during the season to keep the team afloat and lebron healthy"
if Joe Harris makes a single 3 Bucks don't win the title.
"Nope, he’d turn into playoff joe Harris and brick every open shot he takes. Lakers shooting curse plus the lebron curse"
Klay isn’t an all star anymore. Most likely  case scenario he returns and is kind of like Joe Harris
"&gt;First off, no player NEEDS to push off but literally almost every one does, because it's rarely called and it's gives you an advantage. Also, every superstar in the league gets held to a certain degree and conversely pushes off, both on and off ball. Tatum, Kawhi, PG, Giannis, LeBron, KD, etc. all these dudes use their forearms without abandon.  I don't see how this is relevant.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Warriors fans act like Steph's the only one who gets mauled off-ball, every high quality shooter does. I watched PJ Tucker try to hold hands with KD for an entire series and never get called it. Even Joe Harris gets mauled off-ball, his arms are constantly scratched up which really stands out on his pasty ass arms, which is why he struggles vs more physical teams, Steph is the GOAT shooter so he's generally fine with the contact.   &gt;   &gt;Second, Curry when he was younger played in a way different system, him and Monta Ellis played like Tatum and Brown do now, your turn - my turn. He didn't need to push off as much then, because he was usually just watching Monta take a really hard fadeaway two (or Jarrett Jack), or he'd just have the ball in his hands.   &gt;   &gt;Once the Warriors started implementing a motion offense with Kerr did teams really start to hold Steph, especially after that Cavs series. My point was in addition to him pushing off, you guys had Dray and Bogut who could be all-pro NFL tackles if they gained 100 lbs. Not a lot of teams execute illegal screens as well as the Warriors do, Iggy and Looney are also quite good at moving screens and the sneaky wrist hold here and there. You combine both that shit, which almost NEVER gets called even though it's illegal, you gotta muck up the offense somehow or you're smoked.   &gt;   &gt;Third, your last point makes no sense. Where did I ever imply the push off beats the defender no matter what? My point was yes Steph gets fouled a lot off-ball, but it's a consequence of the Warrior's illegal screens and Steph pushing off his defender a lot. Holding isn't the solution it's just a way to slow Steph down. Sometimes he pushes off and gets open, sometimes there's not enough time and space for him to get to his spots. Holding just held off the inevitable for a bit, because Steph will get to his spots eventually.   &gt;   &gt;It's all a part of the game, no idea why you got like offended over me implying that Steph and the Warriors are gaming the system, that's what the best players and teams do.  This is all a weirdly complex and angry response to me answering your chicken and egg question. No Warriors fan acts like Steph is the only one who gets mauled off ball, but it is literally indisputable that he gets mauled the hardest and has the most no calls. The Cavs defenders 2 days ago resorted to, and I kid you not, [hugging Steph and holding him](https://imgur.com/a/qHmkCmG) for the entire quarter. He decided to go full decoy mode and just create open layups after his early quarter 3s because of this.  Second, when I said younger Curry pushing off, I meant 2015-2018 before he got stronger. Really weird misinterpretation because I thought that was obvious. Steph never pushed off in his first few years, because again, he didn't need to. He only started pushing off as a response to the holding. In 2015, the holding rose and the push offs began.  And then I'm not sure if you realize, but your reply actually proved my whole point. The push offs began as soon as Kerr's offense came in because Curry took the scoring and shooting leap, and defenders, especially Cavs and in general finals opponents started holding him.  For moving screens, man, I'm gonna be honest, I really don't care. Yeah call me biased, but I'm here about the push offs.  For your third point, I was talking about NinetyTales saying ""THANK YOU. Steph pushes off ball and bursts away fast so it’s hard to tell. Shit was so annoying in the playoffs"" meaning the push offs were countering the holding and it was ""annoying.""  Your entire point doesn't make even a bit of sense because again, you haven't proved that the holding came AFTER the push offs. Let me explain this to you again:  If the holding came first, the push offs were a counter that clearly worked.  If the push offs came first, then why the hell does the holding not work? Even without any screens in the play.  &amp;#x200B;  The holding began when Steph was on the rise in 2015 and was unstoppable, especially off ball but on ball too. Why would Curry just randomly start pushing off in 2016-2019?"
"First off, no player NEEDS to push off but literally almost every one does, because it's rarely called and it's gives you an advantage.

"No. We had no picks, and Sean marks picked up quality players who were looking to be journey men in Joe Harris and Spencer dinwiddie(currently a max player now) made a trade for Dlo(max player)who helped him turn it around after that Lakers fiasco)and he admitted our franchise changed his life)  when we did draft, we drafted Jarrett allen(Max in Cleveland) and picked up Caris Levert Rights via trade And put together a solid team that put us in position to get Kyrie and KD. 5 Nets players from that Kenny Atkinson era combined are have 100+ million a year contracts now.  Furthermore, Kobe Bryant said he didn’t even want to be drafted here  Nets lost their franchise player in a car accident years ago  Stephon Marbury once wrote on his sneakers “I’m all alone” when he was with the nets  We went to back to back finals and still don’t have a big fan base, as you saw the other night with Steph curry and the warriors were in Barclays  Stop acting like the Nets have been anything short of the Clippers East. This franchise has been through it. You small market teams are  becoming annoying with the big market talk, yes being in New York helps, tell me how that has worked for the Knicks or the nets prior to 2019 when both were in the dumpster or mediocre at best? With maybe one good season the past decade for the Knicks? Both laughing stocks."

"After last postseason, seeing Joe Harris’ face pisses me off."
No KD  No Joe Harris  No Bruce Brown  No Problem!
"We also had KD, Joe Harris, Claxton, and Millsap out (and ofc Kyrie if you want to include him)"
Harden plays pg. Joe Harris and Patty are shooting guards
"KD took the Bucks to 7 games despite   - Harden missing 4 games with a injury. Then coming back at 20%.  getting hurt with grade 2  hamstring strain 45 seconds on GAME 1. That injury takes months to recover from. Harden came back in 1.5 weeks  - missing multiple PGs. Dinwiddie  ACL tear 3rd game of the year. Kyrie ankle injury.    - Joe Harris led the NBA  in 3pt percentage at 45%. Vs the Bucks, he  shot worse than Giannis  - Jeff Green missing 4 games. CHECK back game 5."
"Bro, literally any player would’ve been better than joe Harris"
I think Joe Harris has like two dunks in his career lol
Joe harris dunks?
"Ah yes, well known dunker Joe Harris"
If Joe Harris is the best dunker for Nets then Nick Nurse is the best dunker for Raptors.
has joe harris ever recorded a nba dunk lmao?  best current dunker on the nets is clearly patty mills
They didn’t have joe Harris or Kyrie though!  And the clips didn’t have leonard or ibaka!  And the Lakers didn’t have some of their scrubs!  And the Pelicans didn’t have Zion!  Doesn’t matter that any of the good players above haven’t played the whole season. Dude acts like warriors are the only team that caught these teams short handed.
"I loved him at Duke, didn’t understand why he wasn’t drafted somewhere in the second.   We had him on our summer league team and our gleague team at the time. Not sure why he didn’t get a chance, what else were we doing in 2014? We also had joe harris at some point. We just hated shooting"
"Harden made him look like an All Star when they played together but I have no idea what you could even give the Rockets, they already have all your picks. Only thing I could see is if you gave them Claxton, Cam Thomas and traded Joe Harris to a 3rd team but that’s probably not worth it for you"
"Ah yes, when this sub’s favorite players are Caruso, Joe Harris, Kyle Korver, etc."
Nets need to do all they can to get Turner. The Pacers love their white shooters so maybe Joe Harris can do the trick.
"Playoff defensive standards change on everyone, off ball contact is allowed way more, that's why people like Klay, Joe Harris, Kyle Korver etc etc have pulled some big duds in the playoffs and their stats go down, it can take you off the rhythm"
The Nets already have spacing issues and that's with Joe Harris Harden KD and Patty.  But outside those guys the Nets have terrible spacing.  They cant afford another non shooter when they play Bruce Brown and Blake Griffin as well.  Unless he takes the Bruce Brown role.
&gt; I just think Kobe’s bad shot selection won’t be fixed because he plays in a different era.  The bad shot selection might be reduced with better shooters. Let's say you were to put Kobe with the Nets now instead of Harden. Do you think Joe Harris man is coming over to double Kobe? Or how about KD's man? Unless you're one of the people who believes that Kobe will shoot over the double team regularly while on a title contender.
I don't think they would have tried it with Joe Harris. The only reason they used it was because Brooklyn was running lineups with 1.5 shooters.
"As they play the warriors who’s second best player is Andrew Wiggins. Their rotation  is a team full of G leaguers   ‘No help’ is an unfortunate side effect of the anomaly that was Lebron in Cleveland (the first time around). That was a very unique situation.   Since then, and in today’s game, it’s damn near impossible to really have ‘no help’. But Stephen A’s clown ass and others have helped create an environment where stars get passes and role players get blamed. Which is ass backwards.    This man has James gotdamn Harden. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters…EVER. Lamarcus Aldridge is contributing. Bruce brown is the same guy who was lauded as a glue guy just months ago . Like get this out of here   Not only that, they’re 10-5! Get Stephen A off the air man. He has too much power and he really effects the culture of how people talk basketball"
I mean the nets are missing kyrie joe harris claxton and milsap?
"Ah yes, the ""no help"" consisting of James Harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, LaMarcus Aldridge, Joe Harris, etc. Like if you can't at least go deep in the playoffs with that roster, you might not be as great as you think. Kyrie should be what separates them from ""Clear title favorites"" vs ""One of the most stacked teams of all time"". Anyone who even implies that KD doesn't have enough help is smoking huge amounts of crack."
"Nets offense is a big house of cards rn.  Their only interior penetration is Harden and Kyrie, one is not present, the other is not the same.   Without this, the offense is reliant on outside shotmaking, which is something that Kyrie is obviously good at, but also missing people like Joe Harris or Blake Griffin being insanely cold and the Nets needing more defensive-specialists like Carter or Bembry or Brown (through Brown has at least found other ways to be active on offense)  When all of that is failing, then it's just up to KD to hit shots. If Harden is having a bad night, and then the combination of Patty Mills and Joe Harris don't hit 6 3s combined, it's just KD left, especially against teams where Aldridge can't play because he'd be a defensive liability.  Kyrie would fix A LOT of this, by adding another + healthy interior penetrator, another outside shooter, AND another iso shotmaker. Alternatively, if Harden gets healthier he can get the offense moving more and less jump shot reliant, but that's also a bit limited since he hasn't been a consistent threat in the paint and the only Nets big that's a lob threat has been out almost the whole season"
"He's got help. I hate this absolutism.   Joe Harris is great. Not to mention Harden, even if he isn't Harden of old.   LMA, Patty Mills.   But yeah... Kyrie... that sucks."
Kuminga/Wiggins/Moody going to thrive with Claxton and Joe Harris.
"Steve Kerr's triangle and two against the Nets probably wouldn't work a second time. Especially if Joe Harris is healthy.  Also Steve Nash probably has adjustments ready to deal with the Warriors, but the Warriors and Kerr will probably anticipate those adjustments and have counter adjustments for those adjustments.   Can't wait for Jan 29th. Wish the rematch came sooner"
"Harden is very much still a top star in this league.  He's aging and the new rules are not helping him, but there probably aren't any better #2 options in the NBA right now.  The Nets are just not a terribly well built roster, particularly with Kyrie out.  Even if you could flip Harden for some other star, it's not going to move the needle.  The issue is everyone else downstream.  Joe Harris is a great role player and then it starts getting old/ugly quick after that."
"This no help thing is so confusing. Like, ignoring that Harden was the best player on the Nets last night, the Nets have Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, LMA, and a few other solid role players. Their roster is the most talented in the league."
"Dont act like Joe Harris is some proven dude tho, he been choking so hard in the playoffs. Pathrtic player when it matters"
"If that was a valid reason I don’t understand how winning with harden, Kyrie, joe Harris, griffin and  Aldridge is any more of a “real” one. That’s an obvious superteam in itself so I just don’t see it personally."
"No kyrie, joe harris, and harden still not back 100% is NOT the same team."
"you are almost there.  Embiid, Iverson, Barkley, Dr. J/Moses.   Those are the top 5 guys in my years watching the Sixers(I'm kind of old).  We never did right with Iverson.  or Barkley.   We tried to add non star or former star running mates and it never worked.    we need to maximize Embiid's prime....you trade Ben + some of our young core and picks for his running mate.   Adding in to the already kind of deep pool of vets and role players in Harris, Curry, Green, Niang, Drummond or young guys in Maxey, Thybulle, Korkmaz, Joe, Reed, Springer doesn't really do much other than get rid of a distraction.      You get a guy like once a decade if you are lucky.   You hold out for the right move.  You can always get a subpar package in February"
Harden and joe Harris don’t exist?
"I think it honestly shocked the Nets, they weren’t prepared for that to happen to Patty Mills and it really hurt their offense. Kyrie Irving aside, if Joe Harris was out there then maybe the triangle and 2 wouldn’t have worked as well. But besides the defensive scheme, the warriors were all over defenders and passing lanes. A lot of strips and deflections. Great effort"
"I love how James Harden, Joe Harris, Patty Mills, and solid roleplayers represents “no help”. How exactly is the Warriors current roster outside of Steph any different than what KD has?  Plus the Nets are 10-5. Everyone is acting like they might miss the playoffs or something lol."
Yeah sounds good man. Even the Bucks couldn’t shut him down but you guys definitely did last night for the first time. He wasn’t shooting poorly otherwise at all. What was I thinking?   Taking an open jumper that he hits in his sleep and bricks? Warriors defense for sure. Anything else you want full credit for? Joe Harris didn’t score either. Probably the Warriors defense.   I’ve said that you guys played great defense. But forgive me if I’m going to need to see more than a one game sample to believe that that was the only reason KD looked bad last night.
"How do you explain the Nets SOS though? Warriors has shown more than the Nets this season and people are claiming they are the favourites to go to the finals from the East. I understand they went to the ECF last season, and they deserve to be in the talks. But I dont think its really absurd to think Warriors will reach the finals considering they have definitely proven that easy schedule is definitely not the reason why they have a 12-2 record by beating the Nets, Bulls and Hawks in a convincing fashion  I do think Wiseman will be positive for us but he's really a huge question mark in terms of impact  I wont go into details on whether he will be pre-injury Klay. But even if he became a Joe Harris with better defense, which is probably the worst outcome, the team will still be way better than where it currently stands. I dont think any team gets worse with a sharp shooter"
"Well it's a crazy amount of 3s to take so by that standard we literally have no idea whether it's remarkable or not, nobody's ever done that.  Very few in NBA history seems like a stretch, though.  Harden at that volume was a very good shooter, but not elite.  For example (and tossing out Steph as a crazy outlier) other guys who get somewhere close to that volume and are elite like Duncan Robinson, Hield, Lillard are like 39-41% at the low end and for spot up three point shooter like Joe Harris or Kyle Korver they can push almost 50%.   Dame is a pretty unique player and a half of fame lock but I don't think Duncan Robinson and. Buddy Hield are going down as all timers or anything."

"Not really. Take the 2016 warriors for example, a top heavy team when it comes to centers.   When Bogut went down it meant giving more minutes to Ezeli and being forced to play Varejao.   When Kyrie and Joe Harris are out you have to play guys that probably wouldn't even sniff the court otherwise cause now Patty has to start"
Lol Millsap and Claxton ain't shit. Joe Harris is hit and miss. Kyrie will make or break this team.
SOMETHING SOMETHING JOE HARRIS DIDNT PLAY
"Their postgame thread is pretty salty too. ""Injury-riddled Nets"", as if we weren't missing Klay Thompson (multi-year All-Star, top 5 shooter all-time, all-NBA defender) and James Wiseman (#2 overall pick, and literally 50% of our center presence). That easily outweights Joe Harris, Paul Millsap, and Nic Claxton. Unless you're counting Kyrie, but he's not out due to injury. He's out due to being a woke idiot, which their front office knew full well when they signed him."
Still not convinced when it comes to the warriors they faced the Nets without kyrie the wise one Irving and no Joe the Goat Harris and plus KD wasn’t even trying this game so in my book the warriors are still frauds with an easy schedule 😤
Media tomorrow: but nets didn't have joe harris or kyrie while ignoring they still got two fucking MVPs on the team
Are you counting Kyrie or Joe Harris as that one person?
is there any sign that Kyrie will return? and joe harris doesnt make a big difference other than open 3s im not buyin that
"well, they are missing joe harris right now (and kyrie)"
who needs joe harris when you have patty mills?
Would be likely but nets are down joe Harris who is a key cog for the nets. I can see us winning and breaking the curse
Why not replace Joe Harris with Curry? :)
I feel like Patty Mills is doing what you are paying Joe Harris to do.
"Dude, all the top teams in the league are loaded with talent. Yes, the Nets with a healthy KD/Harden/Kyrie are the solid favorites, but they aren't unbeatable. They're super top heavy and if any of their big 3 has an off night they are vulnerable. They also rely on consistent contributions from key players so their big 3 don't have to score 25-30 each every game.  Joe Harris last playoffs is a good example. He shot lights out from 3 during the regular season and early in the playoffs. He only shot 35% against the Bucks, 33% from 3. The Bucks were underperforming bigtime and they could have won even with Kyrie out and Harden hobbled. Joe Harris shitting the bed as well really hurt considering how close they were to winning.  Of course they would be heavily favored against anyone with Kyrie back, but that's why they play the games."
"I dunno man. We struggled against the fucking Pelicans. Now with Joe Harris out, Millsap out for Personal Reasons and KD dealing with a tweaked shoulder, I dunno, we'll see. I'll just say I'm not super hopeful."
"It will have some impact but not enough to close the gap between why the two are different.  the main reason its different is due to the fact that players play with much more intensity, effort, focus and game planning.  The refs calling the game different (due to the intensity) is certainly a part of it, but not as much.    The result of playing the same team 4 to 7 consecutive times along with the urgency of winning 4 games increases the urgency/intensity by order of magnitudes when compared to one of 82 regular season games.  That's why plays and shooters that excel in the regular season, often have a tough time in the postseason.  That nice easy and open spot up shot or curl to the basket is suddenly much harder to come by.  Players like Joe Harris start to miss open shots because they aren't use to being tired from working so hard on both ends.  Stars who feasted on isolating against mismatches suddenly find those plays less common or simple."
The unspoken issue with KAT is that while he is a tremendous shooter he literally can not create his own shot. He's basically a big Joe Harris out there which is pretty fucking nice to have except you have to draw them up plays. If the team is going to succeed he needs to be a + on D it's just that simple. ANT is less efficient but he gets more volume because he creates.
"KD is the best player in the world. Him and Harden are going to put the Warriors in their place on Tuesday. Lakers x Nets gonna be an epic final. Russ x Harden, Bron x KD, AD x BG gonna be the show of the century. Can’t forget guys like Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Melo, Ariza and Bazemore."
They just need Harden to play like Harden. Almost did it last year with the ghost of Harden and a negative in Joe Harris. Having what they had previously + Aldridge and  Mills should be enough.
Most advanced stats suck. Shit like DRPM would have you believing Joe Harris was the 4th best defender in the league last year
"64 mil over 4 is a bargain compared to what Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson and Davis bertans got"
"Joe Harris had just signed an extension, so they couldn’t put him in the trade."
"The least likely to win imo would be the wizards. Thomas Bryant ,Kuzma, rui hachumara, Bertrans, beal and Spencer.   Can't forget the Nets it's a retirement home except for kd. Kyrie can't show up, so 14v15. Joe Harris. Enough said lol"
"two of these guys are memes: duncan robinson, joe ingles  one of these guys plays on the best team in the league: seth curry  one of these guys plays for a team of mercenaries: joe harris  And then there's Buddy Hield, who is the best player on this list."
It’s debatable. Nets played a closing lineup of kyrie harden joe Harris Durant and Jeff green that pretty much only had one good defender in Durant and one decent one in green. But it was so offensively potent that it didn’t matter. Similarly the warriors could do that approach and still have draymond and Wiggins for defensive stoppers.    Regardless wiseman again won’t be playing in that lineup so lamelo is still better.
"Well you had 4 players that were all stars (randle, lavine, jokic, and embiid). Then you have alot of great role players that came from the draft like Wiggins, smart, Gordon, capela, warren, Nurkic, Bogdonavic, joe Harris, dinwiddie, jerami grant. And Clarkson. That's a lot of money if you stack it.  That's a solid draft that produced alot of good players and 4 all stars. There are more disappointing draft classes than this one. Its just that Parker and wiggins didn't turn out what they expected to be"
"Yeah Duncan is a better 3pt shooter IMO. Harris is likely better as a set shooter, pretty sure he shoots like over 50% on open 3s. But Duncan can hit the really tough contested 3s moving off screens much much better than joe. But then joe is better at basically everything else. I’d say they’re pretty comparable."
"Ah ok, yeah I've seen many people be like ""Joe Harris only leads the NBA in 3 point shooting because he plays with 2-3 other All-stars"" and they don't realize he shot 47% from 3 with the DLo nets lol"
"Joe Harris imo is better at cutting, passing and hustling than Duncan Robinson but I don’t want a lot of Heat games"
Joe Harris went from best 3pt NBA shooter to shooting worse than Giannis in a span of 2 weeks
"Their roles are similar  How and where they get their shots are not   And Joe Harris is a much better all around player, better defender, better off the dribble creator, better driver, better handle to pull up mid range  Duncan is just a better pure shooter"
Naw Seth actually shows up in the clutch. The rest shrink. Especially Joe fkn Harris
The only ones here that are maybe interchangeable are Duncan Robinson &amp; Joe Harris
"Yeah I guess I only mentioned teams in the west.  But you are right. The Nets in the East will challenge them at least. If Kyrie comes back, than it's gonna be an actual battle going all the way, and it's a coin flip.   But the problem with the Nets is their bad defense, and lack of depth without Kyrie. Patty Mills and Blake Griffin will do well in the playoffs, but not much outside of that. Joe Harris vanished last time."
"more specifically, pray that Joe Harris goes like 3/30"
"you're dumb. Nash coached an excellent series, you might have forgotten but Kyrie got injured after game 2, Joe Harris forgot how to shoot, Harden and Jeff Green were hurt, they didn't have a playable center, and they still were able to limit the Bucks offense and keep the series close.  I mean for FFS Harden came back and played 40 minutes without being able to jog let alone run, and they still managed to almost win g7."
"Would a better coach have somehow avoided Kyrie and Harden getting hurt?  The Nets lost because they had KD, Joe Harris, and a somewhat revitalized Blake Griffin surrounded by a several hobbled James Harden and a bunch of G-Leaguers. How do you have upvotes?"
You've got Joe Harris wide open on a corner 3 though
"Harden still draws the attention of a top 10 player and they have Joe Harris, Patty Mills, LMA balling, Griffin, Millsap, Bruce Brown, and Claxton.  Idk, I just think that's better than the Warriors."
Steve Nash lineup you cant keep joe harris in lma in with the non shooters
Joe Harris and KD is unfair
This is the Garrett Temple-Joe Harris show.
"I'm convinced its all mental with Joe Harris, he read pelicans on the schedule and turned into Klay"
this game is like the pelicans v. joe harris lol
Joe Harris going crazy
Joe Harris
Where was this Joe Harris last playoffs? It still fucking annoys thinking about it.
"If you took the ~1960 version of Bill Russell and dropped him into the 2021 NBA, he'd be awful. So your friend is correct.  If there's *any* element of ""give an early teenage Russell access to the modern game and go from there"", then I believe Russell would still become great.  Joe Harris literally weighs more than Russell did in his playing days."
"&gt;Because dunking is not even an actual important statistic, where as you are using actually box score and analytics (3Pt%, 3PT made, etc) in order to make this false equivalency towards 3pt shooting.  It is as important of a distinction as a contested 3 vs a catch and shoot 3, both of which people would use in an argument of Joe Harris vs Steph Curry as a 3pt shooter. Dunks are a recorded statistic and takes as much searching to find as a contested 3, so I don't really know what you're getting at.  &gt;If dunking was a major aspect/subject for finishing around the rim,  The reason dunking isn't a ""major aspect"" is because it is rarer for guys to be able to do. That in itself makes makes someone who can do both more valuable. You can't look at stats of teams that don't have above the rim players and go ""see dunks don't matter!"". That's the same thing as saying because Curry *can't* do something we shouldn't use it against him.  Like, tell Giannis dunks don't matter. Tell Shaq they don't matter. The whole point of this is me pointing out that guys that CAN do both, regardless of how rare, deserve the 10. You listing guys that aren't as good at both means nothing."
"Lets try this another way.  You would be upset if somebody called Joe Harris as good of a 3pt shooter as Steph Curry right? And the reason you would be is because even though his 3pt %s are similar, how he gets his shots matters. Steph can shoot 3s all kinds of different ways whereas Joe is Catch and Shoot, right?  Just change the terms and apply it to around the rim. A guy that can hit layups effectively is not as versatile or as good as a guy that can layup and dunk effectively, because his method is not going to be as effective against as many styles of defenders and teams."
GM’s watched Joe Harris last year and still went ahead and paid a one-dimensional shooter.
"If LMA didn't retire last season, they win it all. Even if everything plays out the same with injuries to Harden and Kyrie. All they needed was one more consistent scoring threat when Joe Harris went ghost mode in the playoffs and KD's shoe was one size too big for the ECF."
"The way FO’s evaluates talent is so weird.   A skilled guy with size like Batum that can defend, shoot and facilitate is getting paid peanuts in comparison to one-dimensional shooters like Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson.   When it’s clear what player is contributing more to winning.   I guess Batum isn’t the best example since he got paid handsomely in his prime, but there’s other examples like him in the league."
"The Sixers lost back to backs to the Knicks and Bucks without: Embiid Harris Danny Green (for one game) Seth Curry Isaiah Joe  Literally 4/5 starters missing. And they played insane basketball. Took both the Knicks and the DEFENDING champs down to the final two minutes (Bucks game was especially tight). Even with a healthy crew, Sixers are moving the ball really well. 4-5 guys in double digits nightly.   The team is so different without Ben and clearly it's for the better."
"Joe ingles is literally memed out of control because he’s white  Jalen Brunson and poetl are nowhere near as good as brogdon and probably just as well known, disagree with those  I’m literally a blazers homer and can say definitively CJ is overrated if anything  Tobias Harris is way more respected than brogdon so to say they’re equal only proves the point brogdon is underrated lol"
Yeah I know BB didn't do that.  In our first game vs the Wizards Doc had Ben play against Westbrook too.  I'm sure tomorrow he'll put ben on Kyrie.  At least I hope.  Like no way he's gonna put him on Joe Harris lol
Joe Harris got 74 mil. Wouldn’t shock me if Duncan got close to 100 mil over 4-5years
Joe Harris/Bertans deal.  3-5 years probably close to 20 mil per year
"2014 is one of the weirdest drafts Ive seen yes it got wildly hyped and tbh the top 10 is one of the worst we've had looking back in many years. You can make a legitimate case the non lottery picks from that year are a better collection of players than the lottery   lottery: Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Wiggins, Jabari, Saric, Zach LaVine, Marcus Smart, Julius Randle, Exum, McDermott   non lottery: Nurkic, TJ Warren, Jokic, Jerami Grant, Spencer Dinwiddie, Gary Harris, Clint Capela, Kyle Anderson, Rodney Hood, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, Dwight Powell, Jordan Clarkson"
Covington Bodgonovic (hawks) and Joe Harris
"Saaaame. Last night was a total bust for me, had Anderson over 13.5 (no Ja, had gone 14+ in 4 of his last 5 games), Joe Harris over 2.5 3pointers only for him to not start and only play 23 mins, and LaVine over 37.5 PRA only for him to shoot 6-18"
"I agree with this take and I’m a Nets fan.  I also really like Allen.  With Kyrie and Durant the rest of the guys on the court loses touches.  Look how Joe Harris has done with his minutes on the court with them.  Jordan isnt the same player he was when he was making All NBA teams but him getting less touches is good.  You don’t need to point to the Spurs/Manu.  What about Levert on Allen’s team?  Is it disrespectful for TLC to start before him?  Or is it disrespectful to Levert and Harris that Bruce Brown, Prince and Green started before them last night?"
"by the 1:22 mark in the first quarter, the jazz were down 31-9, so by normal standards, there wasn't much to watch for, at least for the outcome of the game. and yet, the last 36 minutes of this game were some of the most fun garbage time I've seen in a while.  with Dinwiddie out of the rotation and Durant benched for covid protocol, suddenly a ton more shots were available across the board, and the biggest recipients of all these extra buckets were primarily LeVert and Allen. today, Allen made his first start under the new nets roster and certainly submitted his resume to start for at least until durant returns to the starting lineup with a spectacular 18/19/3s/2b performance and phenomenal play against gobert, easily one of his best performances of his career.   Allen isn't really a guy who can put the ball on the floor and create his own shot so a lot of his points will come from screening actions or garbage men duties, but tonight he showed some [pretty great touch around the rim](https://youtu.be/qo_IbBchV2E) with some drives and hooks directly into the chest of gobert, and a good extra pass to TLC (a fantastically underrated off-ball cutter) on a short roll in the second quarter.   Now, again, while there's really no question on who's the better: Allen or Jordan, there's at least *an* argument that LeVert/Allen is a solid dynamic duo of the bench which gives LeVert the a way better option then Deandre to run screening actions in bench dominant lineups, and Allen could probably be a bigger point of the offense if he doesn't constantly need to defer shot opportunities to two other stars. with only Kyrie though, there's no such bottleneck and the case for him to start becomes a obvious one.   aside from Allen, as this was a complete team win from the Nets: Kyrie was Kyrie, Joe Harris killed it yesterday in minutes off the bench and continues to show all around improvement to go from ""just a shooter"" to a more J.J. Redick type, TLC was a firm net positive in his minutes played and even Tyler Johnson made consistent positive contribution. Hell even Deandre had highlights that weren't lob related.  LeVert's rise to one of the strongest 6MOY candidates has been a fantastic development for his career because he now plays into the paradox that there's almost no one off the bench who can consistently stifle him when they play the Nets, because if they were a good enough perimeter defender to do so, they'd probably already start, which speaks to the different scalabilities off 1v1 instant offense and 1v1 defense.  Kenny Atkinson was pivotal for laying the foundations for this Nets team and under him, the Nets were perennial overachievers on the defensive end, with the cost of their offense being a bit stale and prone to seeking too many mediocre 3 point attempts, though those Nets teams certainly didn't have the same caliber of offense on their roster. However between Jacque Vaughn/MDA/Nash the offense just flows so much better across the board, and the defense hasn't tanked yet. I feel this teams defensive woes are probably overrated, although I wouldn't jump the gun on calling them ""good"" until their starting center situation is resolved."
Joe Harris is not only a better shooter but he also hasn't had the health problems that Kennard has had. A guy with chronic knee problems at age 23 is *maybe* a guy you'd want to be a little more cautious with.
"I wouldn't agree at all, he's basically in that same role of Kyle Korver/JJ Reddick/Joe Harris (not Bertans or Robinson those guys are more 3-dimensional) but as a guy who's just really good at shooting 3s and is an ok passer. Joe Harris is worth 4 years almost $72mil, meanwhile the Clippers extended Kennard for 4 years $64mil. Could end up backfiring I guess but this seems like a pretty decent contract imo.  Not to mention, he literally hit the game winner tonight that got waived off bc Bev got called for a loose ball foul lol, I'm certain his value is already being felt"
"What about joe Harris, caris levert, and Landry shamet?"
joe harris becoming more than a 3 point shooter has really been a great development for his career  his layup and off the dribble game is leaps ahead of where it was when he first got to the nets
Joe Harris shamelessly statpadding lol
KD  Kyrie  Caris  Spencer  JA  Joe Harris  Bruce Brown  Shamet
why did nash decide to bring joe harris off the bench ?
love Joe Harris and LeVert coming off the bench
Joe Harris looks like he'd be the plucky Sargent in a World War 2 movie
Joe Harris running that 2nd unit
"The positives:    Bruce Brown finally getting minutes   Jarrett Allen starting over DJ    The Negatives:    Joe Harris coming off the bench? No idea why Prince would start over him when he is worse at literally every facet of basketball   Regardless, i’m intrigued to see how it works"

"It is him, joe harris and reddick that I like in terms of shooting below steph and klay, that would be my top 5.  I used to like korver too, especially for the hawks."
"So I’m a C’s fan , but in a roundabout way the trade sort of worked for the nets, as it required them to completely rethink their rebuild since they had no control over their draft picks. If they were consistently getting top picks (and it’s no guarantee they take jayson/jaylen or that they develop the same way) do guys like dinwiddie, Lavert, joe Harris, etc develop the way they do?  Do they make the move for deangelo Russell if they are trying to develop a top 5 pick? I firmly believe they don’t get KD/Kyrie without that deangelo Russell 8-seed year showing that they were a legitimately run franchise"
"To be honest, I've always thought that Joe Harris was the 3rd best player on the Nets since KD and Kyrie joined. Don't get me wrong, I think Caris is more talented. However, he's incredibly inconsistent not to mention almost always injured."
the whole team is angrier now. Joe Harris got a tech the other night!
Good joke. With Spence out and Caris regressing into a completely different player our strength has turned into.. Joe Harris is our 3rd best plater

"Take a look at the video clip. Where is the help coming from? How is the defense ""collapsing?""  The logical help defender has his back to the play. You're not leaving Joe Harris in the right corner (hitting 50% of his threes this year), and the help defender in the left corner (the shooter is hitting 40% of his threes this year, and is in the game precisely because Nash trusts him with that shot) is being guarded by Bradley Beal. You trust Kyrie to score over a Beal contest, especially because the angle means he'll see him coming, and that's assuming Beal can get there.   There isn't a coach in the league who wants a three in this situation.   If you've watched Kyrie much, you know that this is an *easy* opportunity for him to get to the rim. He scores here at better than his 3-pt rate even against good help defenders who are in position to collapse, but that's not the case here."
"All scrappy team: Luka, Joe Harris , Gordon Hayward, Sabonis, Jokic  Wow after making this list i have now realized that an all white lineup would be very good"
"Last year the nets did allow a lot of offensive rebounds 6th most in the league.  Watching this year I mostly see Prince and KD playing the 4, those guys aren't great rebounders. If Allen or Jordan has to help on D the glass is open. Joe Harris can at least box out but most of the other guys I see playing aren't great at boxing out with strength or getting to the ball first with quickness and good hands."
Doesn't look like Jamal Murray would be given up for Harden either though. joe harris is a volume 43% 3 point shooter. last season lavert was giving 19 points  and 4 assists. and dinwidie was giving 21 points and 7 assists. both with ok field gal %. And shamet is an active 3 point shooter with ok ball handling and passing. Its not like they suck.
"he also nearly cost the Wiz the game by not getting back on defense multiple times.     Went for a patented low efficiency post-up, bricked badly &amp; complained about not getting a call instead of running back, directly resulting in a wide open Joe Harris 3.   Chooses to shoot a 26 foot 3 from the top and poses with his arm up to watch it go in, it bricks and his man (TLC) gets a lay-up.     When they actually needed a bucket it was Beal, not Russ that made it happen.  The Wiz were lucky to win that game (Nets missed 2 good looks).   They won in spite of Russ, not because of him."
this is the 2nd time Russ got beat down the court late in this game.  A couple possessions ago he was bitching about a no-call &amp; it lead to a Joe Harris corner 3
Joe Harris
Joe Harris said “y’all can eat this transition three” 🤫
"that's a really elementary understanding of the situation but it's also not easy to just turn around the worst team in the league into an 8th seed in 2 years.   -Traded for D'Lo with limited assets  -Drafted Levert by trading Thad Young for a 1st rounder  -Drafted Allen by trading Bojan to Washington and getting a 1st rounder  -Found hidden gems in Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris. Signed them both to team friendly deals after developing them(both of them were out of the league)  -Manuevered our way into creating two max slots while also being a playoff team.  we weren't getting KD or Kyrie if we didn't have our core of pieces that made it intriguing."
"1. They have bad defensive personel 2. Brooks doesn't want to play the rare decent defenders he has, Bonga is DNP, Avdija often doesnt close, heck Jerome Robinson had a great defensive stretch tonight and was never seen again in the half 3. They are small, playing a lot of 2 point guard line ups 4. They have no scheme, unless the scheme is really ""hey you see Joe Harris, well leave him alone open to do nothing inside the arc, do not help, but just leave him"""
"I hate you joe harris, you ruined my post!!!"
who do yall like between Joe Harris and Bertans?
joe harris G R A V I T Y posts incoming
Yo Joe Harris is yatted now  I bet he brews craft beer at home too
Came for a Joe Harris dunk and left disappointed
JH would be a cool team  Jrue Holiday James Harden Jeff Hornacek John Havlicek Juwan Howard Josh Howard Joe Harris
Thought you meant joe harris
I was expecting JOE HARRIS. I will find you OP.
"he's better at playmaking for sure, but he can't catch the ball moving at weird angles and still gun it like JJ. he has to be set in order to shoot the ball. he's obviously a deadly shooter but he can't get as many attempts off as guys like JJ, Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris. those type of shooters open up a whole new set of offense that you can run and we've always missed that since JJ left"
Don't know why I was expecting Joe Harris but that dunk was nasty.
Expected Joe Harris for some reason but this is cool too
Imagine if Trae was a good defender. That would be scary. Dude was struggling guarding a catch and shoot player in Joe Harris
"1. John Collins is going to get paid. He is fearless, has an eye for the ball, highly energetic. He had so many cuts to the basket and when it wasn’t there he would take a solid mid range jumper. He’s high energy without being out of control.   2. KD and Joe Harris seem to be meshing more on court than him with Kyrie. Kyrie still seems to play like he doesn’t have any other scorers around him and their were many possessions where he got tunnel vision. If he’s on point then let it fly but the shot wasn’t dropping."
"Yeah everyone always talks about how 'who can beat a lineup of Curry, Harden, LeBron, KD, AD, Draymond, Klay, Dame, etc etc etc etc. But since when do all those players actually choose to opt in?   The last us Olympic team was Kyrie/Lowry, Klay/Jimmy/DeMar, KD/PG/Melo, Harrison Barnes/Draymond, Boogie/DAJ. Which obviously still won gold and most years would also still win gold, but I wouldn't exactly call currently Melo, Harrison Barnes, DeAndre Jordan or Kyle and DeMar the top of the top talent. Great players, especially at the time, but not exactly the best of the best.   It gets even worse when you look at the last world cup roster  Kemba/Smart/Derrick White  Mitchell/Joe Harris  Middleton/Jaylen  Tatum/Barnes  BroLo/Turner/Plumlee  I know American players tend to care more about the Olympics than the world cup, but like................"
1) well [would you look at that](https://go.nba.com/l5wz). Stat sheet doesn’t lie Trae Young rejects Kevin Durant at the rim. Facts are the facts. Tries to go [at Traes direction again for a dunk and stripped again](https://go.nba.com/v3c6). Sad!   2) This is what capela couldn’t [do in the past](https://go.nba.com/bh0e) next step is seeing if he can get to the point of making basic reads as a passer(which ehhh) but he just took it to Allen physically both games offensively   3) Not a great [Trae young game](https://go.nba.com/jh5n) and the hawks still put up 113 that’s the best sign for hawks fans last night   4) Harris and Durant [work very well as a pairing](https://go.nba.com/r81f) Durant already always knows where Joe is   5) This guy [is always finding ways to cut to the basket](https://go.nba.com/gb4z) KD called him the best at slipping screens in the nba. 71% of his shots last year came off zero dribbles but know your role be very good at it and you’ll make a lot of $$(note I still wouldn’t want to max him unless he learns how to pass better but regardless)  5) This kind of [night for BK](https://go.nba.com/squt) there’s been an emphasis to keep the ball moving so far but it was one of those things last night you had poss like this where things were off while also having those early KD Kyrie pull up poss. Couldn’t thread that middle ground properly.   6) I’ve said in the past I think hunters defensive reputation is kind of overstated but that [he’s more capable offensively than given credit for](https://go.nba.com/r80v) this is [it for him](https://go.nba.com/92yf) 23 on [9/10](https://go.nba.com/18te) keep it super simple spread pick and rolls early where he doesn’t have to think just go down hill
Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the NBA and how did you just leave out Kyrie?
Yeah the nets aren't; we all overhuped them. Lol KD has no support he has to rely on Joe Harris (who?) And Jarret Allen (whose like 23) and Jeff green who is very unreliable
They had to hold back Joe Harris to keep it fair
Joe Harris extends his franchise record for consecutive games with at least one 3-pt make
Joe Harris legit looks like a statue of a greek god
Allen and Joe Harris
"&gt;Joe Harris is a bad defender but Nets fans seem to think he's solid for some reason.  Could the reason Nets fans think Joe Harris is a good defender be that, I don't know, he is a good defender? Zach Lowe just wrote about his defense as a plus in his weekly column, this isn't some random narrative."
Jarrett Allen is a very good defensive player.  Biggest reason why the Nets ranked 15th in defense 2 seasons ago and 8th (pre-bubble) last season.  Compare this season's roster with the ones that ranked 15th and 8th. It's not like the Nets lost a ton of great defensive players. It's largely the same roster except with KD and Kyrie added.  &gt; Joe Harris is a bad defender but Nets fans seem to think he's solid for some reason  You mean the people who actually watch him play all the time lol? What makes you think he's bad? He *is* a solid defender...
This sub doesn't watch the Nets lol. They don't know how Kyrie and KD look great on that end and they think Joe Harris is a JJ Redick clone. The Nets are more talented than the 2019 Raptors.
"Kyrie has been really solid on defense so far, at least as good as someone his size can be  Joe Harris is absolutely not a terrible defender. He's not even a negative on that end. I'd say he's perfectly average, with a good IQ  KD has been fantastic on defense so far this season. He wasn't as impressive against the Hawks, but he's been pretty stellar otherwise  DJ is terrible, can't argue with that one  Allen is a fantastic defender whose only real weakness is playing against elite bigs with a lot of size. Otherwise he's an incredible interior presence, especially against driving guards and wings. His help defense is great, and he isn't half bad on the perimeter.   I don't understand why you're talking about things you clearly aren't informed about, it honestly sounds like you haven't watched a single minute of the nets. My guess is you're just an ignorant hater for some reason"
Joe Harris is a good defender wtf. Does anyone on this sub watch basketball or is this just a drama and memes subreddit?
Kyrie Irving: Bad defender  Joe Harris : terrible defender   KD: used to be okay. Slow as fuck these days  DeAndre: terrible against guards  Allen: overrated as hell   From top to bottom you guys are filled with horrible defenders. I can't name a single plus defender. Maybe Jeff Green? And he's like 40
"Lol that Sixers team would probably beat the Nets too. Nets defense is fucking garbage. The things Kawhi would do to Joe Harris, it would be a massacre"
Delusional. Raps would torch that defense. Kawhi might go for 40 every game being guarded by Joe Harris
"Morey already said Ben and Joe are staying put, and ownership has stated they are untouchable for the past 3 years. The only way I see Ben being moved is if he pulls a Vince Carter. Other than his jump shot Ben brings so much to your team, why in the world would you trade him? Harris is doing much better in Rivers offense."
Joe Harris is nice af
"They manage to keep Joe fucking Harris. An offense of Kyrie, Harden, Joe, and KD will score at a fucking ridiculous rate. It'll likely be one of the best offenses ever, to be honest. Defense is another story, but having a fluid offense will make it easier."
And trade Joe Harris for Dennis Smith Jr and sign J.Cole off the waivers
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
"Joe Harris finally gets some help, smh it was about time"
"Well for one, I wouldn't say most people are butthurt about this. Most people don't care. There isn't a right or wrong way to be a fan, unless you like the Celtics.  But I think a large part of the appeal of sports is the sense of community you get with a fanbase and with people in the fanbase. You go through highs and lows with those people, and the lows make the highs more fun and exciting. When you follow an individual player, you're essentially following contending teams (lets be real, no one outside his family is following Joe Harris) and IMO, you lose that sense of community which is a big appeal to fandom.  But at the end of the day, watch basketball the way you want to. It's not that deep."
They’ll stagger the 3 Stars mins... and joe Harris and green can score
You know Joe Harris is a top 10 3 point shooter of all time if you go by % right
Joe Harris too
They still have Joe Harris
That’s a weird description of James harden and they have shamet and joe Harris along with Jeff green who all can be very valuable in the nba
"Ppl seriously complaining about the bench. They have fucking James Harden, Kevin Durant AND Kyrie Irving AND Joe Harris, Shamet is servicable as well, what do they want that bench to do?"
"Also have Joe Harris, a top 10 shooter in the entire league"
I think we're starting Kyrie (if he ever comes back) Harden KD Green and DJ.  Our bench would be Bruce Brown - Shamet - Joe Harris - TLC - Claxton which isn't terrible. It's gonna be the Joe Harris show.
"Yes, LeBron/AD for Kyrie and Joe “Joe Harris” Harris"
"The # of players on their roster times two, I would guess. Subtract one though obviously since we all know Joe Harris is rocking a half sack"
"They currently have Harden, Durant, Joe Harris, and a bunch of bums unless Kyrie comes back  I have 0 idea why everybody thinks they're a guarantee to win the East"
"They didn't have to trade Dinwiddie &amp; Joe Harris, DeAndre, while retaining Kyrie. They 100% won the trade are you serious? You're dumb bro"
Joe Harris 1v5
"KD, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, DeAndre Jordan, Landry Shamet, TLC, Reggie Perry, Chris Chiozza"
Least thin-skinned: Joe Harris.
"I don't think they will have the stacked expectations that the Clippers had last year.  If they do then the analysts are all fucked in the head.  The Nets are basically just Durant, Harden, Kyrie*, and Joe Harris lol."
"Yeah Deandre is probably a net negative with big minutes.  We better outscore everyone to really compete.  But we might, lineup of Kyrie-Harden-Joe Harris-Kevin Durant-Deandre is a deadly offense."
"The Nets have 3 stars though. Harrell has yet to prove he’s playable in the playoffs. Gasol can be ran off the court. Kuzma can score but he’s inconsistent. KCP and Matthews has little worth if they can’t hit shots.  The Nets still have Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and although Jordan is a bit washed, he can still control the paint as the starting center. Jeff Green is pretty solid too."
"Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet and some dudes they are about to sign with the $15.7 million they have left"
Joe Harris is gonna look like Klay this year hes gonna  be so wide open
Nets would abuse the ultra big lakers lineups. Lakers I think would have to play AD at the 5. I think montrez and gasol would be borderline unplayable for long stretches against the nets   Lakers have better chemistry but the nets do have some solid role guys still there in joe Harris Landry shamet and Bruce brown. I think they also still have Jeff green who can do some stuff
"I know almost nothing about NBA salary caps and how they work, but how can they afford to pay these 3 players? Are they not all max-contract guys? I know they just paid Joe Harris a big contract as well"
They definitely need another Center at the very least. Playing KD or Jeff Green there extensively will not work in the postseason and they don’t have anyone deserving of any minutes outside DeAndre Jordan there.  Maybe they can flip Joe Harris for more of a defensive player? Not sure if they could trade Dinwiddie still if he’s on the DPE.
Ok who is the center gonna guard? Kyrie? Harden? Joe Harris? TLC? Shamet?
damn the Nets didn't have to give up Joe  Harris :O
Having 3 guys scoring 30 a night makes it so much easier for other guys to get open looks though. Joe Harris just got so many open looks from this deal lol.
"I mean you can't just play Kyrie, Harden, KD, and Joe Harris 48 mins per game. You're right that rotations get tighter, but the Nets are only 4 players deep. Yeah 3 of them are top 15 players in the league, but who tf is gonna be able to come in and give these guys any rest without blowing leads??"
"Build a wall with Kyrie and Harden and Joe Harris, ez"
"I’ve been saying the Nets would win the finals because they had Lavert, Allen, Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and some other nice pieces around Kyrie and KD.  Now it’s because they have the best Big 3 in the NBA."
They have no cap space or tradable assets outside maybe Joe Harris and Dinwiddie. Really interested to see how they try to build around these 3 now.
"The nets defense is going to be terrible, they desperately need to make another trade or signing. I mean look at this roster they will be playing now:  Kyrie Irving / Landry Shamet / Bruce Brown  James Harden / Tyler Johnson  Joe Harris / Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot  Kevin Durant / Jeff Green  Deandre Jordan / Reggie Perry  The offensive firepower is insane but who would stop Giannis and Lopez down low?"
"Joe Harris guaranteed 72 mil? I disagree with you there, pal"
Joe Harris is on one of the team friendliest contracts in the league
Shit meant to type Joe Harris
"Man, who would they trade? Joe Harris? Dinwidde? They’ll have even less of a bench than they do now"
They should trade Joe Harris for a defender
"Ehh, they had the deepest team in the league.  They’ll be fine with TLC and Jeff Green and um, Bruce Brown.  Pretty solid bench guards/wings.  Joe Harris at the 3.  Backup Center and frankly starting center is the real problem.  Against most teams it doesn’t matter but against Milwaukee, Philly and the Lakers they need a better big man then Deandre Jordan."
How far do you think they're going now? They already had a lack of depth and now they definitely have nobody really. Joe Harris and Spencer but he's hurt. Also how will the 3 of them work each take turns iso?
"my thoughts are a huge plus is they can always alternate atleast 1-2 stars on the floor at all times, crunch time buckets just 3 dudes who can make shots but negatives are they have no bench besides joe harris, no rim protection, and no defense"
GAVE UP LEVERT AND ALLEN?? At least we still got ELITE MARKSMAN Joe Harris
I imagine they will have joe Harris playing off these guys who can shoot and deandre Jordan   What’s the nets bench situation look like right now
"You have one player on each of them, one player on Joe Harris, and cheat like hell off the other guy.   Actually, my guess is you try to nudge them into giving it to Durant in a position where you can double him, because he's the least likely to pass it out. In key moments in the 2016 series against the Warriors, the Warriors found that KD tended to lose his peripheral vision in big moments, and you could effectively double him.  Whereas I know you can't double Harden the same way, and I'm not sure about Kyrie."
Smart is guarding Kyrie. Kemba is on Joe Harris
kemba is over there guarding Joe harris
"What’s the depth chart even looking like anymore?   On the wings and SG you got TLC, Joe Harris and Bruce Brown, and Jeff Green   Centre: DJ and Claxton?   This is looking really thin but I guess at all times one of the Big 3 will be on the floor and they’ll probably sign a few vet min guys"
Joe Harris
KD sets a screen for Harden  Kyrie gets a screen off ball and cuts to the rim  Joe Harris shoots a 3   BANG
"Definitely, KD and Harden have developed, and there's no way Nash with MDA as an assistant will be  worse than Scott Brooks  Edit: also they kept Joe Harris for more outside threats (something OKC never had with Andre Roberson as the starter)."
Joe Harris is Ray Allen? Poor man's version?
joe harris is our ray allen :’)
Damn I really don’t want to lose caris joe Harris or Jarrett Allen or Spencer I really enjoyed watching these dudes grow and get better each year even when nobody else was watching cuz they were 15-67.
"How many years until they start to really show the signs of aging?  Kd is 32 and coming off a horrible injury.  Kyrie is about a 50/50 shot to be healthy for the playoffs based on the past few years and players tend to become more injury prone as they age.  Harden is 31 and, to succeed, would need to play a different style than he has been playing for the past five years on both sides of the floor (Jarrett Allen, DAJ, Shamet, Joe Harris and Kyrie aren't great in a switching defense).  Not to mention what trading for Harden would cost them or the diminishing returns of having three guys who can carry an offense.  If healthy they'd be a favorite to make the finals for the next 2-3 years and then Harden and KD will be KG/Pierce on the nets age.  If I had to guess i'd say they probably won't win a ring, even if they get Harden on a good deal."
"Maybe, we have Joe Harris and KD who are utterly amazing 3-pt shooters which made the difference.  The 3-ball is a game changer if you can get hot there."
Nets fans we'll gladly take Joe Harris off your hands if your team implodes
"Nets starters today: Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green, Jarrett Allen   Nash either starts Bruce or doesnt play him at all, no in between lmfao"
Yea Oubre has been so trash this year I really wasn’t expecting that. I think I dropped him for either Dillion Brooks or Joe Harris. But Sabonis and Jaylen Brown have been keeping my team legit still.
"Because stars win championships and Kyrie is a star... You have to take those risks of acquiring star players to win. Durant can't lead LeVert and Joe Harris to a championship by himself.  They hired Nash to try to reign him in. Just being a bad leader is one thing, but they couldn't have predicted the events in society that led to this and how he'd react."
"Missing the exclusion of Joe Harris and Jared Allen when listing teammates he wanted to play with, and passively asking the GM to trade for them for better players"
How do you think Joe Harris or Levert feel about this “leader” doing this? Man Kyrie sucks as a teammate
"Lmao you're really stuck on this hill thinking your team is more depleted than the Sixers aren't you?  Ben Simmons, all-NBA player and a starter, was out.  Tobias Harris, a starter, was out.  Seth Curry, a starter and the league leader in 3P%, was out.   Shake Milton, our sixth man, was out. So far, this is 4 of our top 6 guys.   Korkmaz was out.  Matisse Thybulle was out.   As far as I can see, your full starting 5 played meaningful minutes and we played every player available, including Mathias, Reed, Isaiah Joe, and Tony Bradley, all of whom will spend most of the season in the G League."
And Joe Harris.
"After seeing Joe Harris running around in the throwback jersey, the milkman theory is all but confirmed for me"
The Nets still had Scrappy GOAT Joe Harris at least.
Joe Harris is a phenomenal complimentary player. We know Caris can do it well too but all the things you stated are a big reason he’s not a reliable option always
"Well consistent injury issues and being inconsistent coming off injuries means he’s still not good enough to be a 1st or 2nd option for a good team.    Once that’s true as other guy says, a volume scorer just isn’t that useful and add on caris has never been a great floor spacer for a whole season. Someone like joe Harris is clearly more useful for me as a complimentary guy to 2-3 stars."
"Hey man not to burst your bubble, but no magic is happening under Biden. Kamala Harris has been more damaging to POC and low income families than any other active politician , except for maybe Joe Biden.   Edit for clarity; I am NOT a trump supporter, but the amount of people who overlook Harris and Biden’s track records solely because they are not Trump is mind- boggling and why this country will never change"
"I thought he was overpaid this offseason, but true 3 and d players are hard to come by. Most of the time the term gets thrown around to say an elite defender has a passable 3 point shot, or vice versa. Fred's both. Considering how well guys like joe harris got paid, the contract looks completely fine"
Whoever traded Joe Harris away haha
"Joe Harris has made threes in 69 straight games, wonder if that finally ends here 😔"
Fr. Sabonis is on what Joe Harris got lol
Need more Joe Harris minutes
Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen
"IMO that's not a ""role player"", and the names already tossed out here are looking better than role players.    Role players are guys who very rarely (if ever) have a major impact on a team, but do have a well-defined role in the rotation.  Guys like Marcus Smart and Joe Harris are very big parts of their teams.  They can regularly go out there and score 20+, or in Smart's case literally control games with his defense/hustle.  Danny Green is a great example of an elite role player."
"Dragic, Smart, Joe Harris, Jae Crowder"
"When people say he should play like Curry, they don't mean ""play *exactly* like Curry."" They mean ""play *more* like Curry."" Nuanced, I know, but it's important to clarify that.  Many players have made careers by being mostly off-ball and fewer touches due to their shooting ability. Personally, I think Trae has the skill to shoot 38-42% from three. Playing more like Curry, or Joe Harris, or Korver, or Redick, will make the Atlanta offense a little better, at the least."
"You’re telling me 1,000,000,000 people weren’t watching Lowry and Siakam take on LeVert and Joe Harris last year?"
Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen are two of the most likeable players in the league
Tell me reasons you don’t. Tell me reasons you strongly believe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have better morals then Trump.
"A whole lot MJs game was predicated on off ball movement, coming off screens and being able to catch and shoot. He was an elite tier shooter, an elite tier athlete, and an elite tier open court player.  Most teams don't get the choice of having a Michael Jordan. They have to decide between a Joe Harris or Josh Jackson"
I’d rather have Michael Jordan than Joe Harris
Being able to hit set shots from the perimiter. You don't need Joe Harris to be able to dunk and finish strong in the paint. You need him to run off screens and cash 3s.

Joe Harris is so good
Joe Harris is just a chad Baker Mayfield
Idk the Sixers didn’t even touch Joe Harris tonight he should be fine
What tradeable asset do you have that the Nets need *more* than Joe Harris?
They got Joe Harris it's all good
"2014 - The Cleveland Cavaliers draft Joe Harris 33rd overall.  2016 - Cavs trade Joe Harris to Orlando Magic for a 2020 2nd round pick. Magic waive Harris immediately. Nets sign Harris.  2018/2019 - Harris wins 3 point contest and finished regular season leading league in 3PT%  2020 - Joe gets extension in BKN. Gets a Starting role alongside Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  I know there is no way they could have possibly known what was to eventually come from Joe Harris, but Cavs and Magic gotta be at least a little bummed that they had this dude and let him go."
"joe harris is a franchise cornerstone, gtfo with kuzma"
That’s Joe “best G/F on the Nets” Harris to you!
"I'll admit that I didn't watch that much Joe Harris before this year, so I assumed he was just another sharpshooting white guy. I was wrong. He's big. He can put in on the floor a bit. He's just a solid, well-rounded player."
That and we played really well. Joe Harris lit up and Caris was solid. Fro was locking the paint down again tonight too.
"No one is ""supposed"" to lose but it happens. I had a feeling that we would lose but it's okay. And Nets did play very good, especially Joe Harris. Jarrett Allen also improved so much"
Joe Harris is a beast
Joe Harris ain’t coming off no bench
Who cares? There have been multiple games where Joe Harris has been the best player on the Nets this year. It doesn’t matter.
Don’t sleep on joe harris off the bench
"Lebron is great, but KD is also great. AD is great, but then harden is great AS WELL. It basically boils down to Caruso vs Joe Harris, and id have to lean toward Joe Harris."
"Rotation is at least 8 deep. Starters + Joe Harris, Bruce Brown and TLC"
It’s insane they also have joe Harris. Is there anything better than having a dynamite offense than a cold blooded shooter waiting for the corner 3 at all times?
Why? Harden and Durant is just as good as Durant and curry.. if not better. Joe Harris is an excellent shooter and Kyrie is one of the best offensive talents in the league. What part is he exaggerating
Joe Harris and Deandre Jordan. Picture how good the Nets could be with that duo
&gt; ~~Kyrie~~ KD and Joe Harris can act as spacers  Kyrie needs to pat the ball. You can't make the guy with the best handles in the NBA Klay Thompson.
I thought the Joe Harris travel was the worst one they missed
I mean Joe Harris and Dinwiddie are quite good
"Duncan Robinson, PJ Tucker, Ben McLemore, Joe Harris, Seth Curry, JJ Redick, and basically any 3 and D player. It’s a literal role lmao.  As for stars, Harden in 2019 and 2020 literally shot more 3s than 2s. Another example is Steph, Dame, etc.  Not only that, but the league as a whole is trending towards more 3s and fewer 2s every single season.  There is no good argument for the usage of FG%. Not only is it terrible at measuring actual scoring efficiency, it’s also really redundant.  If you love the FG stat so much, you can just add up 2P and 3P attempts. It requires kindergarten math."
He is going to be throwing passes to two of the games best scorers and the best three point shooter in joe harris so 10 assist as he is the best playmaker in the team. And seeing they don't have any good center i doubt getting ten rebounds is our of the question
4.5 Joe Harris is still there lmao
Give them time to get it together and then see where they're at. It was the first game with Kyrie and first role change for Joe Harris (shifting to bench). Harden got DeAndre Jordan to be effective on the roll and their best 3 players played well without much synergy.
"I was talking to my friends about it a bunch during the game. i feel like our best bet would be something like  kyrie / D Green  harden /tobias  joe harris / seth?  durant / simmons  center / embiid  where we try to force drives and pray that harris doesnt get hot from range on seth. but kyrie is way faster than DG and harden is way faster than tobias. Embiid would need to protect the paint like a fucking madman  I mean, would it be crazy to roll out a 2-3 against them in spurts? They just have so much perimeter firepower, we’d have to funnel it into the paint somehow and just try to disrupt as many 3s as possible"
"Lakers big 2 can match the scoring of any duo in the playoffs and has the best defense of any duo, by far. In addition to that the Lakers bench is crazy deep with shooters and playmakers and  good defenders. I don't think the Nets big 3 would have fun playing 45 mpg in a 7 game series against the Lakers. We legitimately have 11-12 players who will see playoff time - AD, Bron, KCP, Schroder, Gasol, Caruso, THT, Matthews, Kuzma, Markieff, Harrell.  Nets have Harden, Durant, Kyrie, Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Shamet, Green.   I have no why idea why they went after Harden when they had Kyrie. Harden is just better in almost every way, now they have more iso and lost Jarrett Allen, who's hella good. This was literally a game where the bit 3 went off and they still lost lol."
Uh huh: https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/23/politics/joe-biden-running-mate-kamala-harris-second-term-president/index.html
"I liked how the Nets were using Harden as the primary ballhander and running screens at him with KD and Kyrie.  Harden did have a few times where he would over dribble and force Joe Harris or Jeff Green into a terrible shot with 2-3 seconds left on the clock.  This offense does look like it could be unstoppable if Harden can speed up some.  Kyrie was gassed in second OT, every shot was hitting the front of the rim.  Sexton looked like the only one with something left in the tank, I think this is the second time I've ever seen him play and that double OT was pretty impressive.  Also, Richard Jefferson is a Cwebb level commentator.  I never really watched Nets games on YES! network much before this  season, but he commentates like a homer who pretends he isn't a homer."
Then just take out Joe Harris put Brown on Sexton and let Kyrie guard Taurean Prince or Osman
Joe Harris is a hell of a role player
This Cavs team is letting Joe Harris out rebound them.
It's just not fair that KD/Kyrie/Harden driving leaves one of the other two wide open for a 3 or Joe fucking Harris.
Joe “Game Awareness” Harris.
Joe Harris is a baller
that behind the back pass while falling by Joe Harris wow
JOE Goat Harris
They have no defense and no depth. They can stagger their  stars but who’s going to step up off the bench besides Joe Harris when one of their stars is double
Nets should be setting pin downs for Joe Harris like last game
Joe Harris as a bench guy saddens me
lol no one scored on Nets' bench except for Joe Harris with 3 pts only
a pair of unlikely blocks by Joe Harris and sexton lol
Joe Harris makes dj look so much worse
hardens really good iso too tho. its not gonna be so easy to double him with joe harris on the floor.
"Joe Harris, Jeff Green are good  TLC, Shamet, DJ are *serviceable*"
joe harris is good
Joe “Joe Harris” Harris
Joe Harris was so fucking open
Joe Harris being there is almost like if the warriors also had JJ Redick...
"Lol 8/8 and joe Harris, a 50% three point shooter is checking in.. the fuck is this offence"
yo i forgot we had joe harris he hasnt even been in the game!
And Joe Harris is a given. How do you keep pace with this team
they had Joe Harris 🐐
But didnt joe harris lead the league in 3 point shooting in 2018? He shot 47%
The next story will be that Nets locker room chemistry will be destroyed by Joe Harris and his antics about the earth being triangular.  Wait and see.
"Yeah there is only so much dribbling needed, but kyrie has succeed in an off ball role and I see no reason harden couldn't as well. Could you imagine trying to defend when lebron can drive and kick to Kyrie, Harden, or Joe Harris? I honestly would have the nets as clear title favorites over the Lakers if you swapped KD and Lebron, but not as it is now."
"Joe Harris, no question"
nets will absolutely give us and the clippers a run for our money in terms of being the top 3 point shooting team. joe harris is a fucking sniper.
Joe Harris
Joe harris is better than the third best player on the Lakers... Dennis? I'm taking Harris over Dennis every day.
"Duncan Robinson, great shooter, great name. But its UVAs Joe Harris"
"I've been saying for years now that Harris is the prototypical role player for a team with multiple superstars. Like his skillset is PERFECT when he is the 3rd or 4th focus of a defense. Some players are better when they are the first or second option, but very few are at their best when they are the third or fourth.   There is a reason the Nets made resigning him to a major payday this offseason a priority and I can guarantee you that part of it was the fact that if they did want to trade for Harden, the Rockets wouldn't be able to ask for Joe."
Joe Harris is more scrappy
"Davis Bertans wasn't used properly (let him shoot everything), when he was on the Spurs   On the Wizards, he lets it fly  I'm saying that Duncan Robinson would only do what he is doing on a select few teams.   I'm not saying what Joe Harris would do in a Duncan R. role.   If you need a special situation for the best of you, i downgrade you.  Like Westbrook with Houston w/o a true center. That spacing doesn't exist on an average team, so i downgraded westbrook's season"
Joe Harris he is pretty good all around and at best is passable on defense on the other hand Duncan Robinson is probably one of the best shooters I've seen in a long time but aside from that he can't really do anything else not even take a couple dribbles and try to get to the rim if his shot is off he is kind of useless.
"We have seen Joe Harris without Durant/Harden/Irving.   He had every chance to be the man last year when Kyrie missed practically the entire season, and they chose to mainly feature an offense designed for Dinwiddie and LeVert. Who are good players, don't get me wrong, just not on Butler or Dragic's class. The Heat featured Duncan super heavily in their offense, despite having other excellent backcourt options."
"It doesn't include hand-offs. I have posted elsewhere those stats and it's night and day.  &gt;And hell, for all we know Harris is better at hand-offs too, but like I said, it's not really much of ""a thing"" so nobody knows.  It is a thing, and if you weren't ignorant/lazy, and had done your own research instead of relying on random reddit comments, we wouldn't be having this discussion.  &gt;it seems like the crux of your entire argument is that Robinson takes hand-off 3's better than Harris and that somehow makes him a better player.  When you have a play that you can spam and score 1.38 ppp with, yes, that makes you a better player.  No one gameplans for Joe Harris. Everyone and their mother does for Duncan Robinson"
"Hold the L on this one, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson are practically at the same level in terms of as players   Joe Harris isn't featured as much as Robinson.  if they traded places, Duncan Robinson would have a significant drop off, because Nets won't use him like Miami."
"In just my opinion, when playing this Lakers team I think its less about ""who's gonna guard X"" and more ""who absolutely cannot guard X.""   Its through this lens I'm worried about the Nets. Harden is looked at as an awful defender, but is great in the post and won't be easily iso-ed by AD/Lebron (it's a losing matchup but not a disaster). KDs likely not what he was as a 1v1 defender, but is still an elite switch/help defender. The problems start with DJ who doesn't block shots or move his feet anymore, and Kyrie/Joe Harris. I don't think Kyrie/Harris are objective liabilities, but against Lebron/AD that's kind of a bloodbath.   The counter is, well, who on the Lakers can guard the Nets top 3. The special factor of this Lakers team is they can play lineups without any defensive minuses and not take a hit on offense. I wouldn't call any one player a real stopper besides AD, but for example a Caruso-Wes-KCP-Lebron-AD lineup has no one you can  pick on and can still easily score. Kyrie/Harden/KD are obviously a different level, but we still don't know how it's all going to add up.   In total, It's not that the Nets lack defensive star power, it's that they need to play 3 guys with no defensive matchup to keep pace. The Lakers don't have that weakness."
One of my biggest knocks on David Griffin was his inability to bring in or keep any youthful talent to the Cavs during our 14-18 window. Joe Harris is a prime example
"Joe Harris has to be on the list. Dude is one of the best 3 point shooters in the league while also being one of the best finishers, can play off ball, is passable on defense, hustles on every play, and everyone who plays with him loves him.  The year he led the league in 3p% he wasn't even going to be in the Three Point contest until Jared Dudely literally called the commissioner and campaigned to have him included. He ended up winning it against a prime Steph AND Klay"
"I agree that Joe has a better all-around game (though I think they're closer defensively than people are claiming).  It's still not enough for me to consider him a better player. Even if Duncan only does one thing, he does that so well that you *have to* gameplan against him or he'll end you - that hand-off with Bam is something that you can base an offense around at spurts. Joe Harris got shut down in the playoffs by JJ fucking Redick two years ago."
"Joe Harris is a very complete player.  He's a terrific 3-point shooter, but he's not a 3-point specialist like many think of him.  He can get to the hoop, he can rebound, he can pass, he can defend.  Literally a guy you can plug into any starting lineup in the league and he'll easily fit.  Duncan Robinson is a pretty straightforward 3-point shooter.  He's elite at it, but that's what he is."
"Maxi Kleber, Draymond Green, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson come to mind"
"But if Duncan's shot isn't falling he's useless on the court and is a terrible defender. Harris could very well be a worse shooter but he can defend,rebound and actually do something else other than shooting 3's (Spo even forbade Duncan during the playoffs last year to do anything other than shoot 3's  because it was that bad).   Also Duncan has a stacked team that allows him to not be the focus of the defence while Joe has always played on low seeded playoff teams until this year and this year he's shooting 50% from 3 as I am writing this comment."
"Cavalier legend, Joe Harris"
Joe Harris. Great question though
"Joe Harris has a better all-around game I think.  He can dribble, he can shoot from mid-range, he can get to the rim and finish pretty well, he's a pretty solid defender."
What about Joe Harris? They definitely had spunk. Loved watching Dudley jaw it with Simmons and Embiid lolll You know Dudley the neighborhood middle-aged dude playing pickup with some high schoolers and still getting way into it.
I absolutely love James Harden and he absolutely wouldn’t be a better spot up shooter than Joe Harris lol
Counter question to this : Who is guarding Harden? And if you devote your best defenders to Harden who is guarding KD and Kyrie what about Joe Harris ?  When was the last time Harden played on a team where opponents cant double him?
"Joe Harris can't do what those 3 do, and none of those 3 could do what Harris does either. He's on pace to be one of the best spot-up shooters ever (8th all-time in career 3P%)."
Joe mother fucking Harris
The reason Joe gets those looks is because of James and KD lol  In a vacuum if you ONLY look at numbers then sure harris shooting wide ass open 3s is gonna be high. But shot difficulty &amp; shot creation along with facing opposing teams best guard defender and everything else factored in.. its Harden and it ain't close
so you really think harden would be a better spot up shooter than Joe Harris. And you also have no reason for it? It’s just an interesting take with no reasoning is all
Who stops Joe Harris?
"Imagine thinking Kyrie Irving is the worst shooter. Embarrassing.   Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris, James Harden"
"It depends on what kind of shooting you want. Catch and shoot? Joe Harris. Midrange shooter? KD. Step back shooting? Harden.  I’d probably go Harden for best shooter overall in all categories, but I’m bias."
"I think the idea of 1 vs 1 matchups is pretty flawed. We saw it at the end of Monday night's game. Joe Harris down the stretch was setting screens for harden to force a switch from Jrue to Donte. If they don't switch then Harden has a clear lane to the basket or Harris can pop for a good look from 3, and switching allows a more favorable matchup for the offense"
"Some notable late picks in the last decade for teams-- most were picked after the 20th spot and quite a few past 25/in the second round   * 76ers: Thybulle, Shake * Blazers: Trent, Barton,  * Bucks: Brogdon,  * Bulls: Butler, Portis * Cavs: Joe Harris,  * Celtics: Semi, Payton, Powell * Clippers: Bullock,  * Grizzlies: Clarke, Tilman, Bane * Hawks: Mike Scott, Spellman * Heat: Richardson,  * Hornets: Devonte, * Jazz: Gobert,  * Kings: Thomas, Hassaan * Knicks: Robinson, Hardaway  * Lakers: Kuzma, Hart, Bryant, Clarkson  * Mavericks: Crowder, Brunson * Nets: Lavert, Bogdanovic * Nuggets: Jokic, Fournier, Faried * Pacers: Aaron Holiday, Stephenson * Pistons: Middleton, Dinwiddie  * Pelicans:  * Raptors: OG, Pascal * Spurs: White, Murray, Anderson, Bertans * Suns: Bogdonovic * Timberwolves: Tyus, Bjelica * Thunder * Warriors: Paschall, Draymond, Looney * Wizards:    Out of those teams, I think the over half (more if you include undrafted players) of the teams get better talent than the lakers in the later picks."
Kd harden kyrie&gt; kd steph klay offensively. Plus an elite shooter in joe harris. That warriors group didnt have any elite offensive role players. I think this team has more offensive firepower without a doubt
And then there's Joe Harris in a small ball lineup. It'll likely end up a game of trading buckets over defense.
"Not really. Most teams do not switch as their primary defensive scheme. Only the Rockets really. The Warriors didn’t even do it as their primary defense. Lots of teams will switch situationally and that’s a totally different thing. Most teams can’t manage to switch because if you switch, you’re gonna switch Kyrie onto LeBron? You’re gonna switch Joe Harris onto AD? No. Teams only do it when it works for them and it isn’t going to work for the Nets. They might do it if the Lakers can force them to, and the Nets will try their best to avoid it."
"Yeah it was literally Harden’s 2nd game... Kyrie didn’t play... and it was only KD’s 10th game with this team, it’s not like he has some perfect flow with Joe Harris, DJ, etc."
"Not sure if it's really sustainable for them to carry the offensive load. Even last night, they needed guys like Joe Harris to step up to even keep the score close. We also have to see how those shots are shared when Kyrie gets integrated."
I almost feel sorry for Joe Harris in May....
"also, no offense to him and his ""family/personal stuff"" but does he think Joe Harris, or TLC, or any other player in the league doesn't have family problems that they wish they could attend to during the season. It's unacceptable to just leave the team like that (unless it was something life or death)."
"What did Joe Harris get in free agency?  What about FVV?  What about Kemba Walker?  What about Hayward?  What about Jerami Grant?  He’s getting a big contract nephew.  Celtics should try to get vucevic, but they won’t do it."
"Unpopular opinion : when the harden trade happened i said that the title is 50/50 against the Lakers , now i say the nets are title lock unless injuries happens , I can't see how a passive AF LeBron can beat prime harden KD and Irving and 50% 3pt shooter Joe Harris"
I hope they keep using Harden as the pg and use Kyrie more as a 2.  Hardens easily the best passer/playmaker on the team and has got KD so many easy baskets along with just feeding him the ball while also being able to get his own shots and set up guys like Joe Harris for good shots.  the only on court question i have about this team is the Harden-Kyrie fit.
Nets building block was Joe Harris after all
"It’s more of a product of the “heliocentric” nature of the league today. Let’s say I have KD, Joe Harris, and Caris LeVert. Based on pure talent LeVert starts, but I’d rather start the shooter to maximize KD *and* let LeVert cook off the bench with Shamet, Prince, and the other guys. Pascall is different, he’s on the bench bc he’s the same position as Draymond, who you want next to Steph as much as possible."
I will when Joe harris drops 60 pts on 11 dribbles
just go watch joe harris then lol
Joe Harris is straight up not as good in the playoffs. He’s a much better regular season dude.
"What are our predictions for the distribution of shots among KD, Harden, and Kyrie in their first game together? I see Harden taking about 20, KD taking about 20, and Kyrie taking about 15. I think Joe Harris would be the only other player to even have a shot at approaching 10 shots in a game, any game where the big 3 play."
"The Nets have been the home for outcast misfits for years now... it's kinda our thing.   DeAngelo Russell was viewed as a rat, Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris were basically out of the league, Caris LeVert was injury plagued, hell even Jarrett Allen dropped in the draft because people thought he didnt care enough about basketball.   In a weird way, KD Harden and Kyrie are the perfect superstars for the Nets"
Joe Harris is very underrated.
I didn't know Harden got there because of Joe Harris
"Yeah, but the Lakers starting five ain't that great. Gasol is way past his prime and Schroder and KCP are just guys. Starter level, sure, but kind of low end starters. But every GM in the league would take Joe Harris over any of those three.  Add in that we have a wild card in Nic Claxton. Nobody out of Nets fans probably know who he is because this is only his second year and he couldn't take minutes from DJ or Allen last season. But oh boy are Nets fans and his teammates high on him."
Mediocre defensive player according to r/NBA Joe Harris is 39th in the league in DRPM
"Spencer Dinwiddie has a player option next year and he's likely to go back to Brooklyn for an MLE.   No one will want him.   If the Nets want a big they will either have to give up 2nds for a bum like JaVale or they'll have to give up someone with real worth.   I'd swap Theis or Thompson for Joe Harris, but I can't see the Nets parting with him."
Joe Harris is more valuable to a championship team than Kevin Love and JaVale McGee. The Brooklyn Nets don’t need to trade for a center.
"They wont be able to stop Simmons either, He will have Joe Harris or Harden on him and he will score 30 in the paint while Embiid gets 40. Nets will have to score a lot of points."
"Joe Harris, Dinwiddie for pennies. Caris LeVert for Thad Young. Jarrett Allen for Bojan Bogdanovic.  He built a solid core with no lottery picks. Only lottery pick was D'Lo thru the Mozgov dump which worked out great.   So just saying the Nets did nothing and got 3 superstars is a pretty weak take."
Larry nance for joe Harris   Maybe both teams say no but I would do it if BK
Not with Drummond's mammoth 29M contract. You'd have to include Dinwiddie and Joe Harris just to match salaries.
Spencer Dinwiddie was on JB not Joe Harris what the hell are you talking about lol
1 game start of season was blow out great example and that game Joe Harris was on Brown and KD on Tatum. Statistically Celtics bottom 3 when Tatum is not on the court. His gravity definitely comparable with Curry.
Man i remember Joe Harris back on the Cavs bench few years back. I was legit wondering why is this dude even there because he never got to play. Didnt even know anything about his game. Im so glad he found himself and jump started his career with Nets and now he is legit top class shooter. Who knows how many rotting potential stars are currently wasting their breaths breathing  in their masks  all game long on someones bench.
"Not really? Joe Harris is elite and Jeff green is solid, Deandre jordan is a backup at best but I gurantee they find help before the playoffs."
"Your edit is untrue still. If Harden iso's for 23 seconds and passes to KD for three, KD has 100% usage for that play, and Harden has the same usage rate as Joe Harris who never touched the ball. Usage rate does not involve assists, period."
"How lol? You said the Nets third best player on that night where KD didn't play (Joe Harris) was worse than one of Iguodala, Olynyk, Nunn, or Precious. That's not accurate at all."
"If you'd watch the games instead of the box-score you'd see that his possessions demotivate our team when he shoots early into the shotclock on a pull up 3 or heavy contested 2 and bricks. When we passed to him on the wing on the first game back he was iso-ing the whole possession even when we had KD and Harden on the court. He didn't pass or move off-ball until this game. When we put KD out which is the bridge between Harden and Kyrie because one only shot up to that point and one still only passed, the games got ugly. Joe Harris wasn't getting looks because he's a ball movement 3PT shooter which Kyrie stopped, which Nash agreed to.  With that said, Kyrie played great tonight"
"Our 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th best players right now are Kendrick Nunn, Precious, Iguodala, and Kelly.  Joe Harris is better than all of those guys lol."
They don't have a single positive defender out there. Joe Harris maybe?
"The Big Three   Kevin Durant , Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris"
crazy to see Patrick Beverly has more 3PTs made in his career then joe harris
I'm so glad I picked up Joe Harris.
Jeff Green and Joe Harris are the Splash brothers lol
Joe Harris the cuter Kyle Korver
next guy to leave Joe Harris open gets traded to Minnesota
"Joe ""Kyle Korver"" Harris"
"KD, Harden P&amp;R, and Joe Harris spacing."
**THREE POINTS MADE**  Heat: 7  Joe Harris: 6
"You don’t want 12 alpha ball dominant players on team USA. You need shooters who don’t need the ball. Guys like Joe Harris, who played really well during the last run.    Sadly the perfect fit for every team USA is klay but he’s obviously out this year."
"Joe Harris. Their other guy is non-existent right now, unless you want Jeff Green."
Joe Harris : Batman   KD: Robin   Harden : Alfred   Kyrie : Penguin   DJ : some down on his luck hobo from Gotham that Bruce Wayne decided to help out
You think a team with a shooter as lethal as Duncan Robinson would know not to leave Joe Harris wide open on every single possession.
An opposing defense in the playoffs is gonna flagrant joe harris on purpose with the level of hell he’s gonna put them in
Joe Harris is probably gonna finish Top 5 All Time in 3PT made isn’t he ?
well it seems like joe harris was the true first option afterall
"Whatever they're paying Joe Harris, it's not enough"
Must be exhausting for Joe Harris to carry these bums
"not only do you have 3 unguardable players, Joe Harris will bang all the open 3s in sight"
Joe Harris is the batman
"TLC is lucky Joe Harris scored that, otherwise KD would banish him to the shadow realm lol"
Joe Harris been eating since the season started lol
"Joe Harris field goals:  5   KD, Kyrie, Harden combined field goals:  5"
Joe Harris would get 70 billion dollars after this game
Is Joe Harris the best player on the Nets
joe harris makes me miss klay thompson
"If the Nets play the Bucks in the playoffs, Joe Harris is gonna torch them."
Is Joe Harris the real #1 option on the Nets?
Joe Harris goin for a 40 ball tn it seem like
joe harris gotta put that headband back on
Dj left Joe harris on an island to get leveled
Seems Joe Harris is taking the Robinson matchup serious
"nets got kyrie, jeff green, kd and joe harris"
"Nah fuck it I want to see a lineup with KD, Hitler, Wokahontas, Joe Harris and Bjelica out there just bombing threes and getting torched on defense"
"If Kyrie played less aggressive they lose this last game by 30. Kyrie isn't the issue right now. This isn't to say that it won't be an issue in the future if efficiency declines, but for now, he's doing what needs to be done.   If Harden is being passive, and Kyrie is deferring to teammates, who is scoring? Joe Harris shot terribly, KD was out - and even if he played can't put up 40 shots a night."
Nets are the big 3 and joe Harris and all bums. The 1st Cavs lost was the most exciting game all year tbh but KD and the nets got shot out he gym by Sexton in double OT.
Joe Harris is a good player
"Respect for Joe Harris for contesting than not.  Also, the Cavs' colour commentator sucks."
"Now run that same defense where the people he’s switching with are Kyrie, Joe Harris and DeAndre and tell me how awesome it is lmao."
What if they trade for Joe Harris to add scoring and maybe a center to put less pressure on giannis. Jarrett Allen?
What the hell was Joe Harris thinking lmao
Lonzo with Joe Harris shooting.

"they might be, if he were willing to be Manu, he could get the same minutes and they'd be able to have Jeff Green and Joe Harris as solid defenders to balance it out; but he wasn't ready to be LeBrons Robin, much less Alfred off the bench lol he's starting and getting his minutes either way. they might be better but it's never gonna happen so it doesn't matter. they'll just be going back and forth between green and harris all season and hoping for the best, unless they decide to put green at the 5 over DJ."
Tfw Joe Harris grabbed a team-high 7 rebounds
Joe Harris somewhere else on the bench thinking “I can’t trust any of these guys with the last shot.”
That dunk on Joe Harris... I feel like maybe he was taking something out on him there. Still owes him for takeout or something.
Trade Joe Harris for a big. He’s their only positive asset left after gutting their depth for harden
Ya I really don't understand how this is even a debate. Kyrie/Harden/AD with guys like KCP/Schroeder/Harrell/Kuzma off the bench is far superior to LeBron/KD/Joe Harris and guys like Jeff Green/ TLC/ and Landry Shamet..
Joe Harris was 29.
Joe Harris for Muscle Chestbrook. Deal?
"Yea, can't believe people want him gone after he just came back for 2 games shooting 29-52 (56% FG%). While his efficiency is probably unsustainable and will drop after his hot streak, having KD and Harden should allow him to play way more aggressively (and make more shots). That being said, they REALLY do need a big man for paint defender and a decent wing defender. Maybe trade Joe Harris? I know the Nets fan LOVE this man but with Kyrie KD and Harden putting up majority of the shots, I don't  see the need for Joe anymore. Joe's contract is also pretty hefty and they can definitely get a nice big man out of it."
"Who cares? Lebron, KD, and Joe Harris is literally the equivalent of a Big 3 because of how good those two are"
"And this is probably our biggest improvement over last season.   Brown used to need other guys on the floor to at least create some space. Tatum was our only guy who could carry the bench. Otherwise, he'd get trapped and turn the ball over.  Now he's scoring +25 a night while sharing the court with Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and two centers on the floor.  I didn't really agree with Boston focusing purely on shooters in the draft, but watching what the Jays are doing without any spacing makes it clear.   These two with a Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Buddy Hield, JJ Redick, etc would be absolutely unreal."
Joe Harris. The white chocolate mamba.
"*Jarrett Allen looks at Joe Harris*  ""Y'all smell that? Smells like bbq chicken"""
They should trade Joe Harris for a defensive wing. Maybe someone like Kelly Oubre?
The smile of a man who is gonna text that gif to Joe Harris later.
Nets gotta move Joe Harris for a defender right?
really good hustle by Drummond to run back on defense and prevent the Joe Harris 3
Marks need to trade Joe harris for a quality big. Only dude on the roster that has any more value
The only assets brooklyn got are shamet and Joe harris. I would try and trade them for a big.
"Is this a joke. He literally said they deserve it because of one reason and that is they pay higher taxes. Not that it could encourage people to take the vaccine which is still a terrible reason. One it's that there is no evidence that the anti-vaccine group would listen to NBA players and take the vaccine. Two, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris who are the President and Vice-President of the US respectively which is a more important position than a NBA player have  have already taken it live on TV. Third, is that the anti-vaccine group already think that President didn't really take it and those who do belive they did take will think that the players are just getting in front of everybody else. Especially those who are the most vulnerable. Plus there is a massive vaccine shortage."
"Pretty sure Harden w/ Embiid &amp; their shooters would be top contenders in the league.  People harp on Joe Harris being good, Seth is even better IMO."
Joe Harris is the only Net that actually attempts to rebound
Richard Jefferson: “I know Joe Harris wanted to make that 3 so bad”   Lmaoo
"Joe Harris after getting dunked on: “I would do it, I’m not going to lie”"
"A DJ, Kyrie and Joe Harris lineup is the wet dream of all the offenses in the NBA."
Wouldn’t be surprised if Joe Harris gets traded for a defensive big.
"And then he called Joe Harris, Joe Johnson"
Joe Harris is better than all of those players lol.
Joe Harris
"The bench is not AS depleted as many say, but holy hell is the big man depth trash. Obviously, not having Caris as the #1 guy off the bench is crap because the big 3 has to stagger minutes more, but not a terribly huge hit.   Other guys like TLC, Joe Harris, Shamat weren't hitting shots and the big 3 were still doing big 3 things. Also, nobody can guard a chair. Not to take anything away from Sexton because he was red hot, but the easiest way to destroy the Nets' defense is just to set a screen. Watch everyone scramble afterwards."
"Joe Harris hit 5/7 against the Bucks in their previous loss, Joe must be on godmode too"
"That probably means Joe Harris gets the start, which is key.   Honestly we should just start small with Harris anyway. Starting lineup should be Harden-Kyrie-Harris-KD-DJ. Then sub out Kyrie and maybe DJ about halfway through the first quarter."
"Harden isn't actually an horrible match up guarding Lebron, he was in 2012, but now he's became so so so strong of course Lebron can just call a screen and he'll never get over it but KD sucks too at getting trought screens.  I guess we'll see a ton of Jeff Green on AD (bad thing) and Lebron (maybe not that bad).  On the other end KCP has always been good on the Kyrie type guards, and both him and Caruso are mostly good on Harden. That leaves KD, and it will be AD and Lebron, I guess more AD to free up Lebron a bit.  But overall expect a lot of small small pick and roll to target the Joe Harris, Shamet from the Lakers, and on the other end Harden will probably try to attack Schroder with small small PNR"
I can see the argument for joe Harris being a more complete player but it’d be real hard to tell me joe Harris is more valuable because what they both really bring to the table(shooting) Duncan is better at
"The issue is if KD goes down.  Do you really think Harden, Kyrie, and spare parts are somehow going to be superior to any of Harden's rockets teams?  If anything the Nets will be worse - Joe Harris is the only other guy on that roster you want playing over 30 minutes a night.  At least the Rockets teams had solid role players."
If joe Harris and Bertans got 20 mil I think Duncan gets 20-22 mil. Way way more the 55 mil for 4 years. Probably like a 4 year 90 mil contract
"That’s not true. Harden isn’t better than the depth they gave away. Look at the last game. Big 3 combined for 96 points, Harden triple double, still lost. And the big 3 played all around *50* minutes.   They will undoubtedly win some games but does the big 3 wanna average 42+ mins per game against the other contenders? Nah. They got beaten by the new Cavs and demonstrated the glaring holes in this roster. No defense, no decent big (DeAndre Jordan is not the answer lmao) and outside of those 3, Joe Harris, Shamet and I guess Jordan, that’s their team. Their only hope is to outscore their opponents and hope they miss, and for the occasional KD block."
Isn't he just a worse version of Joe Harris at this point?
Joe Harris is really really good and they shouldn't trade him.
"Well Joe harris provides enourmous floor spacing. What they don't need is prob bruce brown, and other bench pieces for a serviceable big."
"Surely, a team involving Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden don't *need* Joe Harris to win. If that's the case, then they're not winning it."
"Joe Harris has an argument for the best 3 point shooter in the league this year especially at the volume he's doing it. Top 3 minimum. So yes, everyone in the league needs the best 3 point shooter in the league."
You shouldn’t of said do they need joe harris. Nets fans would do anything to keep him they wouldn’t trade him for Gobert
"They can have one slightly used Tristan Thompson for Joe Harris, if that's what they want."
&gt; Do they need Joe Harris?   Yes
"He's putting up more shots than any time in the last 5 years. He is not ""sharing the ball"" anymore than he used to.  The fact of the matter is that if they are putting up the same stats, Curry is better. It is objectively easier to score with James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Joe Harris spacing the floor than anyone on the Warriors roster."
"&gt;  bunch of minimum wage players.  thats overdramatic. We got MLEs. Some guys still get 15 to 20M/year (Oubre, Joe Harris)"
Worst inbounds play I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen Joe Harris in late games.
The only SF in that list is Danny Green because Seth starts at SG. Also Harden too with Joe Harris starting at SG.
Joe Harris is like a goat tier catch and shoot 3 guy but he shoots FTS like shaq
trade Joe Harris.
If anything the 3pt contest is more lit now. We want to see Steph or Joe Harris or someone go a perfect 25/25 just one time
Joe Harris? Best 3 ball shooter in the league
"B for the Nets, but also A for Joe Harris"
The problem is that other teams with two stars have a supporting cast and a rotation. Nets have neither (if you exclude joe Harris) which means they need all three of their stars
wasn't aware jeff green+joe harris are averaging 25-30 together
"Joe Harris: ""I can't win with these cats."""
"Joe Harris is probably the most tradeable asset they have, btwn possibly trading him and the buyout market, they'll probably still be fine come playoff time."
"without Durant, who's their best defender? TLC? Joe Harris? its not good that's for sure."
You think Joe Harris is the difference between them being the 4th seed vs the 7th seed?
"i thought he said 'yes, they would be doing as well without Joe Harris'"
Joe Harris for Drummond fuck it
Saying Curry is one of the best finishers is like saying Joe Harris is the best 3 point shooter in the league
"**Americans (11)**: Danny Green, Tyrese Maxey, Dwight Howard, Tobias Harris, Shake Milton, Isaiah Joe, Tony Bradley, Mike Scott, Terrance Ferguson, Paul Reed, Rayjon Tucker.  **Australians (2):** Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle.   **Cameroonians (1):** Joel Embiid.   **Turks (1):** Furkan Korkmaz.   **Frenchman (1):** Vincent Poirier."
&gt;What do you guys think about James Harden Jeff Green and Joe Harris and their attitudes towards the situation  It's hard to sympathize for any of the Nets big 3 when all of them have been caught not wearing masks in public
Why'd you point out Joe Harris like he was the sole reason Bertans missed it? Lmao Joey fully deserved to be there and ended up winning...  Bertans should've maybe made it over Kemba but not Joey Buckets
"i doubt there will be a huge bidding war honestly.  not because Lowry's not good but because the teams that want him won't be super flexible in what they can give up. like Clippers would definitely want him, but the contracts they need to send out are multi-year and hefty (Morris, Beverley) and they don't have firsts or intriguing young players to trade. Dallas can do it with THJ and James Johnson but if they don't want to give up THJ then it gets murky - Powell is on a long term deal, they need Kleber etc - Nets can't do it without one of DAJ or Joe Harris that's not happening.  imo the teams with a viable path to trade for Lowry are Sixers, Nuggets and Heat. Nuggets can do Gary Harris+Millsap (unless Raptors say absolutely no multi-year deals), Heat can do two of Dragic/Iggy/Olynyk/Leonard, Sixers can do Green/Scott/Ferguson.   it's possible i'm forgetting or not considering some other team but those seem to be the likely candidates."
Joe harris awkwardly looks around the room
"Kyrie has also been playing with KD and/or Harden this year, as well as an elite shooter and floor spacer in Joe Harris.  He's been fantastic no doubt about it but saying he's been on Curry's isn't true imo"
joe harris is a negative asset on defense
"Joe Harris would be an accountant if he didn't play with kd, kyrie, harden"
“Nah I was banking on Joe Harris creating most of the offense”
"I mean its hardly a big win when we get a worse player in return. Harris is a good defender and an elite role player, Nance may be a better fit in your opinion, but Joe is a rare talent in the NBA"
Is he talking about joe harris cuz i don’t think he will even make all star tbh
"Yeah, that seems like a big W for BRK with minimal upside for CLE.   Nance is kind of exactly the type of four you want to put next to Sexton and Garland and Joe Harris would just take minutes away from Okoro.   Love the fit of Nance in Brooklyn though"
"Hear me out, why don’t the nets trade joe Harris for WORSE defensive pieces?"
Joe Harris for Larry Nance   I bet both fan bases would say no which is part of why the idea intrigues me
Because there are very few players like joe Harris out there
"Joe harris is an incredible shooter. Like one of the best in the league. He's not a great defender, but at the very least he does give solid effort and he's actually a much better finisher around the rim than he's given credit for. And with his contract, it's questionable whether we'd actually get acceptable value for him in a trade.  Also for sentimental purposes, he's the last active person on the roster (since Dinwiddie is hurt) who's still around from the OG kenny atkinson teams 3-4 years ago. Not that that actually matters but I think most fans would be really fucking sad to see him go, on top of already losing Allen/Levert."
"Because it's significantly easier to acquire depth and defense than it is to find an elite role player like Joe Harris.   The same reason you don't trade a legit superstar like Kyrie for depth, like people were suggesting."
"nah. this is probably unpopular opinion but i disagree with restricting 3 points resulted in better product. the reason why nba players chucking threes and jump shooting because it's the easiest way to score. eliminating 3 point line will not change anything but the amount of scores on every shot. a player like joe harris isn't gonna drives more into the lane because three point line gone. they will shot at the places that formerly known as outside of three point line because it's where he's most comfortable for scoring and luka doncic definitely will pass to open shooter if the defense is collapsing, regardless the existence of three point line  if they really want to fix the products, fix the officiating. stop calling fouls on obvious foul baiting and get better at identifying flops and let the game flow more and be more stream friendly. nba international rating is soaring right now because league pass is at reasonable price and quality therefore the game is more accessible than ever and more people will watch meanwhile nba still clinging to cable and blackouts which limit the amount games americans can watch."
Joe Harris
And Jeff green and Joe Harris and Tyler Johnson. They were all so damn good
"I mean tbf, he's now got guys he can trust to create their own shot, and make the shots he creates for them.  &amp;#x200B;  Harden took more shots because it's what was needed.  He was an offense onto himself, but and the Rockets tried to maximize it, but it never got to the point where the players around him were so good within the system that that the system no longer called for Harden scoring 30+.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure Harden wished Ariza/Tucker/Garcia/Clark shots 50%+ from deep on high volume the way Joe Harris does."
It's time to seriously discuss if curry is a poor man's joe harris
i cant wait until joe Harris finishes his career without these 3 guys giving him open looks and people view him as a kyle korver. below Reddick and mike miller.
"He’s got KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris all shooting well from 3. Pretty impressive"
Joe “Bruce Bowen” Harris
"Yeah people talk about KD and Kyrie, but most of Harden's assists are to Joe Harris and Jeff Green."
"Yea a small part of me really misses them and would have loved to see what they could have done if they stayed on the nets, but at the same time I'll most likely never witness a Nets team with this much star talent ever again and in a weird way they feel right at home in brooklyn. Especially Kyrie, over the past 5 years the Nets have sort of become the home for NBA outcasts to get a second chance. Players like Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAngelo Russel, and DeMarre Carroll were all either on their way out of the league or were viewed in a negative light before their resurgence on the Nets. Then you have players like Jeremy Lin, Mozgov, Okafor, and Shabazz Napier who were giving the chance for redemption. Hell even Levert and Allen dropped in drafts for various reasons. Kyrie was the perfect first superstar for this franchise and the fact that he came here in part because it was his childhood team and he viewed it as coming home makes it that much better."
Joe Harris is like Bruce Bowen. Also Russ FT fell off a cliff too.  Wtf is going on
Joe Harris is better than Kyrie.
Tbf Joe Harris and Jeff green are doing their parts. Green has been the perfect pnr partner hitting 40% 3s and being able to finish at the rim with huge dunks. Harris has been absolute gunner
In Houston he was always doubled. Sometimes when he crosses half court. They couldn’t do it as much with cp3 but teams realized they could with Westbrook.   Now what are you gonna do? Leave Joe Harris open? KD open? Kyrie open?   Lol.
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles. Here are a couple recent ones:  DeMar DeRozan: [https://basketballbeacon.com/demar-derozan-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/demar-derozan-player-profile-stats/)  Joe Harris: [https://basketballbeacon.com/joe-harris-player-profile-stats/](https://basketballbeacon.com/joe-harris-player-profile-stats/)  If you like them, feel free to get on my mailing list - [https://basketballbeacon.ck.page](https://basketballbeacon.ck.page/)  Thanks!"
"Nah not joe harris kyrie.  It's not like they getting rudy Gobert, no interior guy they can get trading harris will make up for terrible perimeter D."
"The whole variance thing isn't usually predicated on having KD, Kyrie, and Harden on the same team. The chances of all of them swinging low *four times* in a 7 game series is just not going to happeb. And if it does, Joe Harris will be wide open. KD isn't really a high variance scorer either, and Harden is only taking efficient shots now."
"He's not really doing anything differently than he did in Houston, the team around him offensively is just lightyears better. He never had an offensive player like KD, never had an elite shooter like Joe Harris, hell even Kyrie right now is probably better offensively than the CP3 he got to play with who wasn't at his peak anymore."
If any team can do it it’s them lol although I feel like they’ll be better off come playoff time if they can send Joe Harris out for a defensive big man
"Yeah, exactly. In other words, it's reasonable that a 50% shooter (e.g, Dwight Howard) or an 84% shooter (e.g, Donovan Mitchell) could start off 17/25. On the other hand, the odds of Dwight Howard (or even Donovan Mitchell) starting off 95/105 is so incredibly small that we know Harden's FT% must be above that.   As Joe Harris takes more free throws this range will narrow, but it wouldn't be surprising for him have a FT% of 80% at the end of the season.  Note: We're making the (solid) assumption that a player has a ""true"" free throw percentage that doesn't change throughout the season. In that case, each shot gets us closer to revealing what that FT% is. The only case this assumption should fail is a significant midseason injury."
70-80 million range i would imagine. He will want at least similar to joe Harris.
Klay wished he would be as efficient as Joe Harris
Joe Harris has games like this all the time especially if he’s left open as much as the lakers have left him open last night. The fact is if Kyrie shot better. That beating would have been worse than it was
And Joe Harris who shoots like over 50% on open 3's. They're insane.   The only reason they're so slept on is because we haven't seen enough of their Big 3 together just yet. It'll be nuclear when all of them are fully engaged
"Also Herro, Duncan Robinson, Vucevic, Joe Harris, Connaughton, Redick, Grayson Allen, Bertans and Ingles."
"Yeah but if Joe Harris wasn’t extremely hot and the lakers weren’t extremely cold, the lakers blow them out as well."
"Kyrie is putting up Steph numbers, Harden and KD will be themselves and Joe Harris is God. I think even uncle Jeff has been balling out lately"
Joe Harris is a luxury on this Net’s team. If they’re able to trade him for a serious rim protector and defensive anchor they’d be much more balanced come playoff team. KD/Harden/Kyrie are more than enough for an elite offence.
"I understand what you're saying, and again I like Joe Harris a lot. I'm referring more to the weak point (if you'd even call it that) on their team."
Forget Steph Joe Harris is the goat shooter
"I'd pick serious rim protector and rebounder that's more reliable than DeAndre Jordan. (ahem... Andre Drummond)  Joe Harris is great, and is thriving over in Brooklyn with those guys. But all three of them can shoot. Joe Harris is just another shooter. They need some interior defense."
Holy shit so many Joe Harris posts
"Probably happened a year or so ago, but Joe Harris has dethroned JJ Redick as the best spot up 3 shooter in the game."
"The Nets secret weapon.  If I had to pick a non-star to flank KD, Harden and Kyrie it might be Joe Harris."
The dumbest decision David Griffin ever made was to trade Joe Harris away for nothing
"I think  1. Lakers were really hurt offensively without Schroder and AD. Offense was pretty bad without LeBron. Probably the only one who can create his own shot consistently is Kuzma 2. The lack of a good defensive center in AD's absence really hurts them. I think I'm going to echo my earlier sentiments where I thought they should have kept Dwight. Dwight is able to give you the same things as Montrezl on offense and is a way better defender despite getting called for all the ticky-tack fouls  3. Nets are a really good offensive team. I think it's no surprise to anyone that even without KD, Kyrie/Harden is still a force to reckon with. Of course, Joe Harris only makes them more dangerous.   Honestly, most of these can be seen earlier in the season. Game was a little lacklustre but had a few moments. As chemistry gets better within each team, and the stars come back, it'll be more interesting to see how it plays out"
I was just about to make a post about Joe Harris' shooting haha. Good thing I looked up r/nba first. Harris is really having a brilliant season. After last night's game his 3pt% is up to 50.7%. One of the most valuable role players in the league right now.
"To all the ppl who think they won’t make it to finals cuz of defense. Ur team has to pray that 2/3 of their big 3 has multiple off nights, then u have to double them which leaves joe Harris open. DJ brown TLC Jeff green are role players who do their job. They prob aren’t done making moves and they have 3-4 solid defenders who can get timely stops in the playoffs. Feel like a lot of ppl are underestimating the impact of having 3 generational scorers on one team, and at the same time 1 of them is one of the best playmakers in the league. They gonna win the East and give the lakers an even finals(or whoever comes from west)"
"POV Youre the lakers:  Kevin durant is out. Phew. Kyrie’s not getting it done, nice. Alright now let’s just lock down harden and it’s a done deal, easy. Wait, what’s this? They still got Joe “Joey Buckets” Harris wide fuckin open."
"The great stoics: Zeno of Citium, Marcus Aurelius, and Joe Harris"
"Ahh, the perks of teams not being able to double team you anymore whilst being elite shooters + getting wide open looks.  Joe Harris efficiency is bonkers though. He might be the GOAT 4th option."
"Joe Harris &amp; Matthew Dellavedova together, a weapon to surpass Klay &amp; Steph."
more like Joe Harris is who Eric Gordon thinks he is
"Klay Thompson is basically a poor man’s Joe Harris  There, I fixed it."
How is it disrespectful? Doesn‘t Joe Harris have the best 3pt stats in the NBA right now?
"Not to shit on Joe Harris; he's an excellent shooter. Having said that, any competent three point threat would have roided up numbers if they were starting on the Nets.  Harris is good, but lets be real. He's putting up those numbers because he's got so much freedom to shoot the ball because the Nets have Kyrie, Harden, and Durant. If Joe Harris is putting 40 on you, your defensive game is pretty god damn good.  Harris is a good shooter, it just bugs me when people attribute  his numbers to his growth or him being in a ""system that allows him to finally shine"". Its none of that. He is just a good three point shooter on a team with James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant."
Joe Harris is one of the great stoics.  His brand doesn't need social media.
Lakers haven't been able to score even against bad defenses. It was our own defense winning games but with Dennis being out on top of no AD this L wasn't a surprise.   Nets have amazing offense with 2 of the leagues top offensive players of the season so far NOT counting KD and Joe Harris is literally God but evaluating their defense using this game aint it. Lakers are a bad benchmark right now
Yeah man we will see if our two MVPs and total of three all NBA players can manage to let joe Harris scrape us past the first round
Sometimes I have this dream where I'm an NBA player and everything I shoot goes in. Then I watch Joe Harris and feel like this motherfucker is living my dream
Joe Harris is great but this is disrespectful to Klay
"To quantify the sample size impact: For 17/25 shooting, the reasonable range of ""true FT percent"" for Joe Harris is about 50-84%.   Nerd background: The FT% can be described by the beta distribution, specifically beta(makes, misses). You can think of this as ""what true free throw percentages could result in making 17 out of 25 free throws"". For Joe this is beta(17, 8). You can type this in on Wolfram Alpha and see the resulting range (I took the central 95% to get FT range=50-84%). For comparison, James Harden (95/105) has a much more constrained range (84-95%), and Thanasis Antetokoumpo's (4/7) has a much less constrained range (22-88%)."
"Joe Harris with Kyring and Durant to space and take off offensive pressure, and Harden to pass him the ball is a cheat code.  Perfect 4th man for them.    &amp;#x200B;  Then again, I've been high on him for a while, cause he comes out of UVA.  UVA finds good-great shooters (Brogdon is another UVA guy for example)."
Joe Harris fucks boi
We'll see if Joe Harris and the boys get your asses out of the first rd this time
Joe Harris is ultra instinct Seth Curry
Joe “Joe Harris” Harris
Joe Harris underrated af  As a nets hater he's the one player I wanted them to lose in a trade
Joe Harris is mvp
I love Joe Harris but it is very funny seeing you list him with those other five players.
joe “i just work here” harris
Did Reggie tell Joe Harris to “keep strokin it” after the post game interview?
"This was the biggest thing from the Harden trade imo. He's going to get other guys involved so much better than KD and Kyrie will, and Jeff Green or Joe Harris randomly showing up and dropping 20 makes Brooklyn a lot more dangerous"
"as a Nuggets fan, the Bucks. no way in hell do I want to go up against Kyrie, Durant, Harden and Joe Harris in the finals"
Joe Harris is who Seth Curry thinks he is
"&gt; Joe Harris now leads the league in 3P%, TS%, and eFG% with shooting splits of 53.4/50.7/68.0 lol  ""Nets gotta score 130 every night cuz they're going to give up 120 every night"""
Is Joe Harris God?
"Joe Harris is a member of the Nets Big Four, idc what anyone says"
Joe Harris is klay 2.0
Seriously just keep leaving Joe Harris open smh
"Joe Harris now leads the league in 3P%, TS%, and eFG% with shooting splits of 53.4/50.7/68.0 lol"
"Yeah there's never been such an offense hesvy team like this before so it'll be interesting to see how it works out as the season goes on.  I imagine defenses against us will be tiring out quicker as well as trying to defend joe harris + the big 3, letting these guys be open would be suicide"
Joe Harris is underrated
Joe Harris is the perfect player for this team
What the fuck is Joe harris
"Joe Harris has to cool down some time this season, right?  Right...?"
Joe Harris v LeBron James MVP race heating up.
Joe Harris is like always open
Joe Harris looks like Ben Affleck’s character in Argo
Joe Harris is klay 2.0
Does Joe Harris ever miss?
Joe Harris is cooking!
Omg Joe Harris
And they got a 3-pt shooting champ in Joe Harris who can knockdown open 3s. Mega scary team. Even without the lockdown defense.
There's no excitement in this game at all lol. I can only watch Joe Harris shooting practice for so long.
#FUCK IT PUT ME IN ILL GUARD JOE HARRIS MYSELF
Joe Harris needs a nerf
joe harris is a monster man
"Redemption song Joe Harris is in the same sentence as KD and Harden now. This is a moment, thank you."
Joe harris filling the gap thankfully
imagine if the lakers closed out on Joe Harris as hard as they close out on Jeff Green
omg that ball movement to the Joe Harris 3 made me nut
"Let’s keep the toxicity down guys. 3 compliments to the Nets:  - KD, Kyrie, and Harden on one team. What I mess around with on 2k has come to life. Nasty scoring. 🔥  - Joe Harris and Shamet are providing solid roles as straight shooters. Even Deandre Jordan shows up from time to time when it matters 🔥  - Off ball movement that Nash and co have implemented leaves one player given a good look. 🔥  Good team at 2nd in the East, and I don’t think we’ve seen the best version of this team yet. Any more moves and trades can only make this team a real threat 🙏"
That Joe Harris bank 3 was the perfect moment to capture the half lol. But banking on a team full of shooters like yours to go cold is asking to lose
I think thats the biggest thing. Theres zero chance all 3 have an off night. Then you throw in a shooter like Joe Harris and stopping them becomes even more difficult
"""Like this guy and joe harris"" Haha no way Shaquille is saying Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot"
i dont see any team outscoring them 4 out of 7 games. 3 all time great efficient scorers and an all time catch and shoot guy is too hard to overcome. cant gameplan against 3 great iso scorers. not a team in the league that has 3 elite perimeter defenders that can limit them. when harden was cold in houston nobody could pick up the slack of efficient scoring now he has 2 who are arguably mroe efficient. When kd was in okc he could not have a cold night as there was no other high effeciency back up. now they have 3 elite scorers that can create for themselves. that has never been seen. give them too much attention and joe harris is open who shoots 49% from 3. its just too much man
Lakers made a little push at the end. Let's see how they respond in the 2nd half. Seems like LeBron has to carry the team tonight.  Joe Harris is a sniper.
Blocking foul on Lebron to end the half was the same call on Joe Harris earlier in the game.
If someone like joe Harris (very solid player) made it over dame you can say it’s a race issue. However Luka is very popular because he is amazing at playing ball not because he is white. Also as a Dallas resident no one is the area’s care about anything other then the cowboys
Joe motherfucking Harris is a beast. He's the dude who drains the three every time Kyrie or Harden is doubled.  Frankly the Nets have a big 4
James Harden wishes he could have played with ANY role player of Joe Harris’ caliber in Houston. For all the threes they chucked they didn’t have anyone that reliable. Harden would get them the best looks imaginable and they’d still hit it like 30%.
"I listened to his pod with arnowitz some time ago... similar... if we go by stats only, guessing based on feeling, sga, derozan should be all stars... so would joe harris in the east... come on, all star is not about 1-2% here or there, there are some unwritten rules...  Book is the best player on 20-10 team with 50/38 shooting splits... and watching every suns game, cp3 is great but book is better and it is his team... conley over book is damn disrespectful...  (I never get into these kind of discussions, but just have to do it this time for book)"
Stopped reading when you called THJ “good to great” my man isn’t even better than Joe Harris
look bro everyone knows the real reason why Kyrie KD and Harden went to brooklyn was for a chance to play with the all time great Joe Harris
&gt;Did Houston get enough or should they have asked for more?  Short of also getting Joe Harris there really wasn't much more to ask for.
"Harden and KD are the Nets two best players, and the only decent players they’d have left are Kyrie and Joe Harris which would be a dreadful team. The Nets already have a depth issue as is, without KD and Harden that team falls apart.   Clippers might be able to look respectfully mediocre, but they wouldn’t have a chance at making the playoffs.  If you have two top 7 players no shit you’re going to be reliant on your stars. Honestly it’s impressive how many solid role players the Lakers have around them in Gasol, Schroeder, Trez, KCP, Kuz, etc..."
"DLo, Joe Harris, Levert, Rondae, Jarrett Allen.  6th man Dinwiddie"
It is very well because of it.  Their big rotation is basically a mix off Jeff Green DAJ Bruce Brown KD and Harden.  None of those is a true PF and only one true big man in Jordan.  Joe Harris and Harden have to guard bigs loads of time and get switched onto bigs.  If youre arguing its by design he guards bigs sure but the only reason is because their big men rotation is awful not because hes an insane defender down low or anything.
More like Joe Harris decided he didn’t wanna win
Nah man the mvp is clearly Joe Harris. He’s played ALL of his 32 games so far. Can’t you believe it?        /s
Wish I could go back to the “is lebron an elite 3 pointer” thread from then. Someone tried to tell me he’s a better shooter than joe Harris because he takes tougher shots
You just named two teams that broke up because of cheap owners. Suns and Thunder could've easily resigned Harden and Joe Johnson they were just cheap. I'm not the biggest Josh harris fan on personal level but I respect him because he's not cheap.
Kyle Lowry  Joe Harris  OG Anunoby  Jerami Grant  Rudy Gobert
i see joe harris set a lot of screens and smaller guys do need to get their shoulders into guys to try and set the screen so i can understand what was happening but yeah its pat beverley
"I have to lean Philly. The Nets have nobody to stop Embiid from scoring, and Embiid in the paint and Simmons on the perimeter is about as good as it gets for slowing down the Nets offense. Other guys like Danny Green, Harris, and Curry can help keep up with the Nets offense, too. The Bucks, on the other hand, have great defenders in Holiday, Middleton, Giannis, and Lopez, but their defensive scheme often allows for too many open threes. Giving a team with KD, Harden, Kyrie, and Joe Harris open threes is not good. The Nets don't have anyone to stop Giannis, of course, but three is more than two and that has often been the issue for the Bucks."
Joe Harris is the Hunter X Hunter of our big 3 anime.
"Joe Harris is a better player. All I see Robinson do is shoot, He obviously is a good one, But Harris has a lot more moves in his bag. Joe Harris is better."
"He came for Joe Harris, not KD or Kyrie."
Kevin Durant James Harden Kyrie Irving DeAndre Jordan Joe Harris  Good luck scoring 90 without your starting 5
What are you smoking? My man Joe Harris played every game
"The Nets big three average 81 pts, then you got snipers like Joe Harris, Uncle Jeff, Shamet, etc. And you can expect about ~10-15 pts from DJ &amp; Brown from P&amp;R. All in all, that’s nothing but a pipe dream.Holding any team in today’s league to 90 pts is already hard as it is, let alone the best offensive team."
God I love Joe Harris.
"They aren’t gonna play hero ball for 48 minutes. When it comes down to closing time in a tight playoff game or when the nets offense has gone cold, they have arguably three of the top iso players in the league to get the team a bucket and keep them in it. And plus they clearly showed they’re able to play defense tonight as it wasn’t a shootout and both teams ended the game around 110 points. Their defensive rotations are pretty suspect now but in the Phoenix and Clippers game tonight, they’ve shown flashes of defensive effort and that’s all they need as their all time great offence will win them a lot of games, reg season or playoffs.   And who is a “total ball stopper”? All three have shown the ability to share the ball, get others involved such as TLC, Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, Shamet... etc. This isn’t the OKC KD and Russ show. Harden and KD are willing to defer to Kyrie if he’s hot, Harden will undoubtedly play like a pure PG come playoff time and depending who’s hot that night will get the ball in closing time."
And Joe Harris
At 25M he is unpaid.  Compare him to deals signed this offseason like Joe Harris or Rudy Gobert.  I think the last time I looked his deal scales down allowing for more flexibility (in terms of the cap) going fwd.
"Bruce brown, Jeff green, Joe Harris are good players then the rest of our bench is shooters"
"Harden beat you guys with floaters and 3's though, did the last play make you black out the other 47:30 of the game... Also Harden has usually gotten double teamed in the playoffs, cant see that happening much if he's flanked by Kyrie, KD, Joe Harris, Jeff Green."
So many storylines   Lebron KD  Lebron Kyrie  Lebron and Cavs legends Jeff Green Joe Harris  Basically Lebron with everyone and then AD and Harden are there too I guess
"It's a game winning flop from your star player that's averaging a 20 pt triple double on 50-40-90 shooting. How can you not appreciate a player like that as a basketball fan. If some random Nets role player like Bruce Brown or Joe Harris made that play, people would be begrudgingly respecting it, but since it's Harden its full on hate. If Pat Bev did this for you guys, Clippers fans would be pumped as hell, same as Celtics and Smart, Raptors and Lowry, Lakers Caruso... etc. I could go down the entire 30 NBA teams and list at least 1 player who falls a little too easy on contact trying to bait calls, and usually that guy is a fan favorite of that team, while fans of other teams fucking hate him, but accept they'd like him on their own team."
Where you guys when Joe Harris didn't get a call a couple of mins earlier?
Joe Harris should have gotten a foul call a couple of mins earlier. It was consistently inconsistent refereeing. Happens.
"How do the other 29 NBA teams not scout a dude on a historic pace last season? Seems a bit off, but in regards the actual question, yes Joe Harris is a more complete and better basketball player."
I know Joe Harris isn’t a superstar but Joe Harris makes guarding the top 3 guys impossible. A Joe Harris open 3 is Brooklyn’s highest value shot aside from an open layup.
"~~KD~~, ~~James Harden~~, ~~Kyrie Irving~~, ~~Joe Harris~~, **DeAndre Jordan** will hit the big shots for the Nets!"
i feel a joe harris 3 coming
Good cut by Joe Harris
You’re just saying things just to say things   Heat fans are low on DRob now and obviously Joe Harris is better
I mean they already have 3 superstars who almost always play well.   Joe Harris has been a consistent player for multiple years now. Idk about the rest of their players but it's easy to play consistently well when u have 3 superstars
"i think it finally hit me - this team is basically the houston rockets except better in literally *every single way*.  Especially where the old team was flawed especially in this small ball lineup.  Better shooters, spacers, ball handlers, one-on-one defending,  bigs (still shit but better),  role players, like damn.  No wonder Mike said hell yeah ill come over and be assistant coach.  Harden plays the PJ role but is multitudes better on offense.   KD shouldn´t even be compared to anyone on the Rockets but you could say he plays the Jeff Green role in this offense (and they also have actual Jeff Green).   Kyrie is a better fit than either Chris Paul / Russell Westbrook.   DJ is a better Capela and then you top that off with a 3 point shooter on a level that Houston never had in Joe Harris? JEsus christ"
Joe Harris snuck into my sister's DMs so I guess
joe harris isn't a traffic cone on defense and can do things other than shoot 3s on offense so yeah
"Joe Harris is insane as a 4th or 5th option, *embarrassment* of riches indeed"
“Finally Harden is gonna take a break”  *Joe Harris enters the chat*  *Immediately drains a three*  LMAO
Joe Harris&gt;Curry
Yup nobody can stop Joe Harris. You can’t even hope to contain him
who is fucking with the nets...they have Joe Harris who's the best spot up in the lg...ggz
Joe Harris has been terrific on the defensive end
&gt; FOURTY FIVE PERCENT 3 point shooter open in joe harris??  51%* :D
"i just cant see anyone outscoring brooklyn enough to beat them come playoff time.   i dont care (and i say this as a lakers fan) who you have on defense, I genuinely don't know from a mathematical game theory perspective how you can find enough offense to beat them 4/7 games.  AD is  arguably one of the best defenders in the game and LBJ is LBJ but jesus christ any scheme to defend this nets team will have to result in allowing someone else to beat you but they have Kyrie, Harden, and Durant.  So you go balls out and lock down those three but now you're going to let a FOURTY FIVE PERCENT 3 point shooter open in joe harris??  Or you're just going to let DJ catch lobs all day?"
Joe Harris is open for 3 but you can’t go help because you’ll leave Kyrie open lol
because we still have Kyrie and Harden lol (and Joe Harris)
Paul George can’t help onto joe Harris because Kyrie Irving is also in the corner lol
James Harden could not understand why Joe Harris threw the inbound pass to Bruce Brown lmao
Lmao Harden giving the shrug to Joe Harris when he inbounded it to Irving instead of him.
Net role players also play zero defense. And outside of joe Harris no they don’t hit open shots consistently. If harden/kyrie shoot 1/8 from three I’m gonna be critical of them as well as shamet. The idea that lebron didn’t play poorly last night is crazy you guys come up with any excuse for lebron. He’s an all time great but he had a bad game
"Assuming you mark out Giannis on KD, Dort on Harden and Simmons on Kyrie,   how is Bam keeping up with Joe Harris running around the floor?   and Gobert is getting dragged out of the paint by Jeff Green when Brooklyn goes small and we know how Harden can pick him apart when he's out of the paint."
"Does ESPN's trade machine take any of this into account? It let me set up a trade between NO and Brooklyn where I traded Adams for Dinwiddie, Jordan, and Shamet.  Edit: yeah ESPN takes restrictions into account.  For example Joe Harris or Jeff Green can't be traded until March 1. Since Adams doesn't have anything I'd say he's free to be traded anytime."
Joe Harris apparently as well
Imo Joe Harris needs more recognition considering he’s shooting a measly 50%😯 from the field and from 3
Joe Harris. That's it.
"I’m taking a core of KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe harris, and Jeff Green any day over Mitchell, Gobert, Clarkson, Conley, and Bog. Playoffs come in and their a different beast, as you’ve seen with harden against you guys"
The team whose second superstar has a lingering bum leg and a roster that when LeBron or AD get doubled teamed they shoot sub 30 percent  vs.  A roster with two 2-way superstar wings surrounded by 40+% letting those superstars play in single coverage along with elite defenders  and   A roster that has 3 top 15 players with a 50% sharpshooter who can’t be helped off in Joe Harris   Hmm...
"No, it’s Joe Harris"
Joe Harris is shooting 50 fucking percent?!?!?!
"Joe Harris is just a way better pure shooter, helps harden out a ton. Parsons was good too"
if Joe Harris was traded to the lakers his percentage would drop by 20%.
Joe Harris is loving that inbound pass from Iggy
I mean Joe Harris was also more of a spot up shooter then and nothing else hence the lower attempts. He actually shoots more deeper/off the dribble/step backs now
Lebron putting all the white guys in PnR. Did it with Joe Harris too
Joe Harris doesn't do insane amount of off-ball movement. He's hitting 3.4 threes a night at 51%. It's not inconceivable that he can make more if the big 3 give him even more opportunities.
"Joe Harris is making 3.4 threes a night at 51% rate as the 4th option.  I think the current Nets team puts him in the perfect situation (Nobody is going to double him, he may even get left open, Harden is really good at finding him) to break the record if the team decided to help him achieve that."
Great I’ll take one Joe Harris.
Joe Harris shot 47% on 5.1 attempts in 2018-2019.  Whilst that's very impressive it's not on par with this season's 50.7% on 6.6 attempts.  This increase in shooting percentage on higher attempts is a result of increased spacing and open looks having 3 of the Top  10-15 offensive players in the league.  I'm not sure why you decided to take my comment negatively and respond with aggressive sarcasm? It was meant as a compliment.
"I’ll admit the nets as constructed probably won’t beat the lakers, they still need another defensive piece. Hur you’re kidding yourself if you think anyone from the East is going to keep up with a harden, kyrie, kd, and joe Harris offense"
Joe Harris is mf sniper
MF Joe Harris wtf is that 3P%
"&gt;Joe Harris might be the best role player harden has played with  I dunno man, that KD guy is pretty good."
Joe Harris is also becoming ray allen lmao
Joe Harris is the answer to all those questions
Kyle on Joe Harris  Fred on Kyrie  OG on Harden  Pascal on KD  We might be able to hold them to 125.
"Our plan is basically to leave 34%-35% open not 40% ones.   But in all actuality the corner shooter is almost always the guy left wide open, No matter if he's a below average or an elite shooter and teams usually put their best shooter (like a Joe Harris) in the corner) thee so they still make us pay."
But we have Joe Harris tho.. how can you hate on him?
Give me Harden and Kyrie over Wade and Bosh any day of the week. And then Joe Harris? Forget about it lol.
"Speaking of Joe Harris, he doesn't get enough credit."
"Counter argument: they’re the team to root for because of the power of friendships: KD and Jeff Green go way back to Sonics days, Harden KD Jeff Green OKC days, Blake Deandre Lob City, Nash Amare MDA Suns coaching staff, KD Kyrie Deandre the 3 musketeers that signed with the Nets to make it all happen. And the rewarding underdog/ feels good stories for guys like Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, come back story for Blake"
Joe Harris knows damn well what he did
Clutch fucking steal from Joe Harris.
It would be Joe Harris
Joe Harris
Joe Harris is a great player
Joe Harris was slaying too many MILFs. He’ll be back to normal soon enough.
Joe Harris looks like someone you’d see at a rock climbing gym
Why wouldnt Joe Harris start when he is such a good player?
PG: Jrue Holiday/Kyle Lowry   SG: FVV/Duncan Robinson/Derrick White   SF: Joe Harris/Kyle Kuzma   PF:  Kevin Love/Blake Griffin   C: DeAndre Jordan/Andre Drummond/JaVale McGree  Is this the worst possible team you could assemble out of that finalists?     Edit. I am not sure about Point Guards
"That hurt your feelings man? Lmao. But for real, you’re delusional if you think OG is going to have an easy time and that Harden+Kyrie aint enough to beat the raptors. Dont even get me started with an open Joe Harris when you box and one the guards.  This is from a brooklyn nets hater btw lmaoo"
the Joe Harris disrespect is out of this world.. Joe Harris is definitely starting over Blake Griffin.
&gt; Nobody was ever doubling Joe Harris..   WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULD
Nobody was ever doubling Joe Harris.. but they are leaving Joe Harris open now to double Harden/Kyrie and Durant when he was on the court. That's why his 3-pt FG% is sky high..
"Maybe for raw PPG because everyone is getting looks, but in terms of scoring efficiency, being surrounded by All-Stars means you take on less double teams.  Joe Harris' 3-pt FG% this season (&gt;50%) is proof of that."
"Obviously Blake is the bigger name base on his history (and I guess DeAndre too), but each of Joe Harris and Bruce Brown &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each of Blake and DeAndre."
Joe harris and crowder
"It’s Possible. But with the third star getting their shots, joe Harris gets some up, and Blake will now want some shots it’s going to be hard"
What about the best 3 point shooter % wise in the game? Joe Harris??? Come on now. Beal is on a shit team he shouldn’t be that high up
Kyrie harden kd joe Harris DJ and Blake too
"Would have to face the Cavs in the East still.  Kyrie, Joe Harris, Lebron, Jae Crowder, Tristan Thompson  Bench: Garland, Sexton, Wiggins, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Tyra Jones  Would probably beat y’all out"
Oh shoot my bad haha. But Harden is still way better then Durant also Joe Harris is white
"Take away the 2nd best player. hence why harden isn’t there. It goes Joe Harris, then Harden then KD"
"The fouling out thing was a hyperbole, but my point stands. If you’re going to wall up Giannis, you need to do it with the right personnel. You need 2 good-elite perimeter defenders (Raptors: DG, Kawhi, Pascal. Heat: Crowder, Iguodala, Butler), and an elite rim protector (Raptors: Gasol and Ibaka, Heat: Bam). You can’t wall up with Joe Harris, KD, Kyrie, and DJ, he’ll slide through them like butter"
there is no way on God's green earth that we would trade Joe Harris for Aldridge
"Just checked that table, Joe Harris has 126 made threes (ranks #4 in the league atm) on .506% rofl are you kidding me."
We need a guy like Joe Harris and I doubt we’re going to find one. Better off waiting.
"Joe Harris  is #4 shooting 50,6% from 3"
"Alright I'm not here to argue semantics, bottom line is Joe Harris is really fucking consistent"
Not Joe Harris.
Joe Harris is shooting 53% from 3?!
"If Joe Harris or Luke Kenard get 80 or 64M, Lonzo about to get the bag because he can shoot, way better passer, and way better defender."
I mean he's the 4th option offensively and 2/3 of his shots are 3pointers. This year in particular he's been less aggressive because of the big 3.  Here's the usg rate of each player mentioned above in the corresponding season. Most of them are low:  |Player|Season|3pt%|USG%| :--|:--|--:|--:| |Joe Harris|2020-21|50.6%|16.0%| |Tim Legler|1995-96|52.2%|14.4%| |Steve Kerr|1995-96|51.5%|12.9%| |Jason Kapono|2006-07|51.4%|17.9%| |Detlef Schrempf|1994-95|51.4%|21.0%| |Steve Kerr|1994-95|52.4%|14.0%| |Steve Kerr|1989-90|50.7%|14.0%| |Kyle Korver|2009-10|53.6%|15.3%| |Jon Sundvold|1988-89|52.2%|23.9%|
Joe Harris has the 4th best career 3pt FG% in NBA history. That's not going to happen lol
Joe Harris isnt one dimensional
"&gt;Beverley is swapped for Kyrie. Ariza is swapped for Joe Harris. Ryno is swapped for KD  Yeah just make these 3 easy swaps and its basically the same team just a bit better, thats all"
It’s a souped up version of the 2017 Rockets. Beverley is swapped for Kyrie. Ariza is swapped for Joe Harris. Ryno is swapped for KD.
Joe Harris is basically Korver on a super team and he can play defense. This Nets team is one of the craziest offenses we have ever seen and it's really fun.
"I shared this in the Nets' sub:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tOjr9OJxQI)   &gt;   &gt;Saw this stat at the 1:04 mark.   &gt;   &gt;Min 500 attempts.   &gt;   &gt;46.2% Duncan Robinson 19/20   &gt;   &gt;44.4% Klay 17/18   &gt;   &gt;43.7% Klay 14/15   &gt;   &gt;43.7% Steph Curry 18/19   &gt;   &gt;43.6% Klay 15/16   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;[Link](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3_PCT&amp;dir=1)   &gt;   &gt;Now this is a short season so Joe prob won't get to 500 attempts.   &gt;   &gt;Joe Harris has made 109 of 196 attempts for 55.1%  &amp;#x200B;  That was 8 days ago, so with the All Star break, sure not much has changed.  That's an absurd difference."
"I know you're joking, but Kyle Korver's 3 point volume in 2009-10 was closer to Bol's in 1994-95 than what Joe Harris has shot just halfway through this season."
But they have joe Harris for that.
"Is he better than Joe Harris? They have the same role, and Harris is a decent defender from what I can see"
He'd be in a completely different role. That's important. Try imagining Joe Harris running an offense in playoffs vs just knocking down corner 3s.
"Anyone who's played NBA Mobile knew that a 2-pointer can cost you a match haha. Jokes aside, basketball ""meta"" will always strive towards fancier, more intricate moves, and higher offensive output, hence why jacking up 3s will forever be valuable. Take Joe Harris for example. Without his 3-point elite shooting, he wouldn't be near anything to what his contract is right now."
"That Golden State would still have been one of the most stacked team in history.  If KD would've 3-peated with just Kyrie, Fro Allen, Caris Levert, DeAndre, Joe Harris, Dinwiddie (no Beard or Blake), they he'd definitely vault right up there."
"Fall and winter of 2020: Kyrie is a cancer, KD isn't gonna play as well off an injury, DJ is washed, no bench, Joe Harris is overpaid, Harden's fatass is gonna drive the team apart, not enough shots for everybody  2021: waaaaaaah! super team! waaaaah!"
"Only alternative is Joe Harris which I wouldn't do, he's been really good for them.   If a trade like this happened, I would think Kyrie/KD would understand that it would improve their team."
"Duncan is probably Joe Harris, Tyler is still so young, maybe Book or something like that."
"One team also has Kyrie Irving, James Harden and Joe  Harris, the rockets Have Christian Wood."
"Before Harden they'd definitely be better but with Harden Kyrie's a way better fit next to Harden. The off ball weapons KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris act as are ridiculous. Harden's ball dominance is a great fit next to them since he's their point guard.   Defensively I can see it CP3 isn't saving them and Kyrie's been really good on offense."
Any plans on having Joe Harris as a guest?
It’s funny that you think Joe Harris the star of the Nets. We all know it’s Bruce Brown
Wonder what Joe Harris said to convince Blake
Who would you bet on to win a 3 point contest: Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris?
I think there’s a lot of great shooters like Duncan Robinson or maybe Joe Harris in this position.
"We might be one of the most deserving fanbases after what this organization went through after the big trade.  It was pretty bad that we mortaged our future until 2019 for players who left after 1-2 years of the big trade. Even worse was the constant harassment by Celtic fans in every Nets game thread or Nets related move. Since Marks took over, in 5 years, with no picks or superstars, he made this organization a place where players want to play, displayed a team whose culture was about the players, and prioritized winning over tanking. Our development is showcased with so many players. DLo, Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Levert, Allen and to smaller degrees guys like TLC, Claxton, and Brown. We've shown we kind find talent at bargain barrell prices, in order to surround our studs.   So KD , Kyrie and Harden didn't just fall into our laps, its been in works for 5 years. IDK if anyone remembers the words of the prophet Luis Scola, but he called it. He said once this teams starts to win, they will get anyone they want. Thats a testament to Sean Marks and how he's build this organization."
70% TS for Joe Harris on *that* team is so deadly.
Harden is actually a *pathetic* 64% TS so I edited. Kyrie is averaging 27 on 62% TS and Joe Harris is at 15 on 70% TS.   That is almost 100 ppg for the Nets from 4 guys averaging 65% TS.  The points per game will likely go down a little bit for Kyrie and Harden with KD back but they have just an absurd offense.
"He gets his respect as a player, but I get your point, his shooting aspect isn’t highlighted as much as other players. I honestly think that’s just because he’s a bit more well rounded than guys like Duncan Robinson and Korver. A (very) extreme example of this is Kevin Durant, he truly is one of the best shooters in the league, but his name just isn’t brought up when talking about the best shooters as often, since that’s just one facet of his game. Obviously Joe Harris’s game is not remotely as well rounded as KD’s, but I just used that extreme example to display my point a bit more, Harris can go off the dribble, finish, and defend just a bit better than those other shooters you mentioned."
"Clarkson, Joe Harris, Schroeder, Mikal Bridges, DiVinchenzo have all been solid this year."
"If you're switching everything, it's going to leave you open to mismatches. E.g. Schroder picks up Harden, DeAndre sets a screen, Marc Gasol is on Harden and Schroder is on DeAndre now. Either Harden takes Gasol one on one, or lobs it in for an easy basket. If Harden drives and AD helps, that's an easy pass to KD for a wide open basket. If LeBron rotates to KD, that leaves Joe Harris open."
"Nets don’t really have “scraps” though. They basically gave a six man and their starting big and a tonne of picks. Before the harden trade they were arguably the deepest team in the league. Outside of the big 3 they still have one of the best shooters in the nba (Joe Harris), a decent veteran forward (Jeff Green), Bruce Brown who’s been a really good two way do it all player, a very promising young big who can switch onto guards in Claxton and the washed up corpse of Deandre and Landry Shamet who kinda sucks now.   And this is all with the extremely untimely injury of Dinwiddie.   The only thing they lack is a big body inside for AD and Embiid every other team they can smoke pretty easily."
"Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris and role players = stacked? We’ve been largely without KD for the last month"
Make Kyrie mad. Guard Joe Harris and KD well.
My strategie is  the Nets team dont use a lot of off ball movement especialy when all three on the floor.it mostly extra pass to joe harris wide open three or pnr with DJ. everything else it iso situation which they excel at. so you have to play tough perimtere defence settel for contensted 2. when kyrie or kd go to bench your job is to make harden life difficult he is the team motor and it worked before.if you have guys like simmons or holiday or shorder double team him if you can . when harden go to bench pick your poison let kyrie punish you instead of kd or wide open harris.  it a matter of picking your poison . and how good you are on offense. you need to sink 3 and punish them on pnr and attack the basket
I think the issue with trying to force them to take bad shots is   1. They hit those bad shots at a crazy high rate especially against 1 on 1 isolation defense because they're crazy talented scorers  2. If you double the ball handler Joe Harris is probably lurking around somewhere at the 3 point line
"I would be surprised if all four of Harden, Kyrie, KD and Blake share the court much. A washed Griffin doesn’t really offer much that Joe Harris doesn’t do much better expect size and even then it’s not like he moves at all well anymore"
"Lmao if Blake is the 5th option from 3, Joe Harris is #4 shooting (*jesus*) 50.6% from 3  Mr. Silver please move the line back a few feet"
"Well, not really KD.  Even passing to a guy like Joe Harris instead of Eric Gordon is a massive upgrade"
"Lmao.  Developing Joe Harris and Dinwiddie from the G league and drafting Allen and LeVert in the late first is not ""actually rebuilding?"""
"Harden's numbers isnt winning basketball? We are 18-3 with him with Joe Harris being his 2nd best player sometimes. His teams have always been in the top of the standings for the past 6-7 years, largely due to him."
"#DEFINITIVE LIST TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEAUTY#  Ibaka, Love, Rubio, Mitchell, Horford, Joe Harris, Oubre, Valancuinas, Ellington"
&gt;replaced CP3 with Joe Harris
"offensively: 1. Nets 2. Nuggets 3. Suns  defensively: 1. Bucks 2. Sixers 3. Suns  The rest don't have a big 3. Ibaka, schroder, conley...lol  Nuggets on the other hand, have the only legit big 4 in the league. Although Nets are pretty close with Joe Harris."
"Hes 3rd in the league in ts% among guys who shoot more than 10 shots a game.   Efficiency should be rewarded, its not hes like joe harris (1st in league) whos offense is going to be based around the big 3."
"&gt; All it takes is one star having an off night or an injury and your lack of depth absolutely kills you.  Not really. They have 4 elite scorers. They can realistically afford for 3 of those guys to have an off night and still be fine because that 1 is enough. Maybe not if Joe Harris is that guy but Kyrie, Harden and KD could all will a team over the line on their own, and realistically they're not all going to have off nights at once just because it's so rare for any of them to have an off night in the first place"
"You didn't mention Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, Shumpert, and Joe Harris  for the Nets. You didn't mention Haslem or Chris Andersen for the Heat. Anyways, I'll"" go with Miami."
"The Nets shozld trade for Curry. He’s in his prime i’n sure he want’s to win now.  Joe Harris is almos as good of a shooter. Claxton is an exciting young player, and they could also include DeAndre or Blake to give them a former all star. And of course multiple second round picks.  Who says no?"
"If you gave Shaq average handles, passing ability, off ball movement, court vision and outside shooting he would basically still be Shaq. Actually if he was average that would have elevated his game. If you gave Kyle Korver and Joe Harris average passing, handles, court vision and off ball movement they would be basically the same. That’s the kind of players they are. And if they weren’t tall and big bodied they wouldn’t even be in the league.  For whatever reason people seem to think Steph’s offensive presence is just his shooting, or at least mostly his shooting. His brother Seth is about the same size as Steph and even early on had respectable handles, passing and off ball movement along with incredibly elite shooting. But he wasn’t even good enough to be a bench player. And even though Seth is now great at all of those things he’s only a rotation piece. That’s what would have happened to Steph if all he had was his shot and was even just good at everything else."
"Man I miss when this sub wasn't overrun with casuals, Klay is the furthest from the 2nd best shooter ever, to put it into context, even Joe Harris is better than him. In terms of pure shooting Klay wouldn't even crack the top 10."
Joe Harris is likable and Blake Griffin is half likable
"I’m saying there are many components to Curry’s game that make him an all-time offensive threat. If he were missing those other components he would not be much of a threat. Even with his quick release he would be easy to guard if he wasn’t a threat to drive, and didn’t have his great off ball movement, passing and court vision. He would struggle to get open, and his shots would get blocked all day long along with tons of turnovers. It would also be super difficult to fit him into offensive schemes.  His own brother Seth early in his career was a similarly elite shooter but just okay at everything else. In fact his shooting numbers were and are better than Steph. But he wasn’t even a bench player. He was in the G-league. It wasn’t until he improved all of his other skills significantly that Seth became a solid bench player and now a starter averaging 13/3/2.  I’m not downplaying Curry’s abilities. If anything I think he’s underrated. He’s the best shooter ever but plenty of other guys are nearly as good him in terms of pure shooting but not even close to his level overall. Guys like Joe Harris, Kyle Korver and a few others have close to Steph’s pure shooting ability and have the advantage of being way taller and bigger, but bring nowhere near Steph’s total offensive pressure.  Also not the best metric but Steph has been to the 3-point contest 7 times and has only won twice. And he’s also never led the league in 3-point percentage and is currently 39th this year. Again, he’s the best ever because of his overall volume and range, but other guys have been on his level if you’re just looking at shooting. It’s all of the other components of his game that make him an all-time great."
"&gt; It's very clearly a flaw in the system that allows the rich to get richer at no cost.      I mean, technically by your logic the rich aren't getting richer because they are signing for the vet minimum.      You can create a new system all you want, teams will find out a way to get around it. In these instances, the teams are not being forced to keep the player for the remainder of the season, it makes them look better because players will see that the team takes their situations into consideration. And it's not like it's Nikola Vucevic forcing the Magic to buy him out and then him trotting over to LA or Brooklyn. These are over the hill vets who want a shot at the championship. Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are the 4th or 5th option **at best** respectively as a scoring option on the floor with Durant/Harden/Irving. Then you need to take into account, arguably, the best 3 pt shooter in the league in Joe Harris, if he's on the floor, those guys are below him IMO.      Just admit you're upset because it's not *your* team like the memes above."
"Nothing will ever again be a KD Warriors situation. He joined literally the greatest regular season team of all time, who had already won the championship just the year before, and were up 3-1 in the Finals that year. The Nets haven't accomplished anything.  KD, Harden, and Kyrie on the same team is outrageous, yes. Especially with Joe Harris as a top-tier scoring thread always lurking on the outside. But these new acquisitions don't scare me much. The Sixers have proved that they can win without Embiid, who IMO would be the frontrunner in the MVP race if he was healthy."
"I think Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie come across as likeable. Honestly I like Durant and Harden too but can understand why people might not.  Remember too we don't actually know these guys so ""likeability"" is just whatever arbitrary reasoning we apply to it from our limited glimpses at their personalities in the media."
"I think it’s pretty clear the 2 max slots were for the star players. Caris Levert, Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Jarrett Allen are very enticing surrounding pieces for 2 stars though. But go on trying to exaggerate things and delude yourself more"
Yep that's what I meant by in the midst of their run.  Durant can just sit til the playoffs. The Nets are stacked with Joe Harris playing like mini-Klay.
One obvious mistake in that chain.  Joe Harris over Kyrie
"LMA and Joe Harris definitely above him, so no"
A better comparison is would you take Irving and Joe Harris over Klay and Dray.   The Nets have a dope big 3 but the warriors had a big 4
"bro harden has played like 5 games without kyrie and durant. You acting like he's playing with scrubs when he's got kai motherfucking irving almost every game dropping 28 points and 6 dimes with his typical dominance in the clutch. and he's got the best sniper in the league joe harris and some defenders like brown and claxton. And some other decent players. They should be a two seed, especially considering there are literally 3 legit playoff teams in the east.   &amp;#x200B;  Jokic is in one of the most stacked conferences of all time working with no other all stars and a bunch of scrubs. He has murray and porter and then scrubs."
Joe harris in 30 years
All that good defense won’t hold back their big 3   Plus Joe Harris is a better shooter than everyone on our roster combined
All I know is people often put out starting lineups that don’t feature Joe Harris. That man absolutely has to start even when KD comes back.
"Odds are he won’t even be that #4 guy with Joe Harris getting looks from their big 3’s gravity, more likely that Blake (Aldridge too) gets free points as a screen setter with the occasional spot up while being the last offensive option"
I knew this before the trade even went down. Many were in denial. You gonna have to play these guys 1v1 and these are three of the best ISO scorers in the game. Then you’ve got sharpshooter Joe Harris behind them lmao.
Joe Harris imo. I trust him more than anyone to knock down the open catch and shoot 3.
Are we forgetting Joe Harris?
"1. Russ has never been anywhere near as efficient as Kyrie, Harden or KD  2. Harden was a 6 man and while he was good, he was nowhere near the player he is today. He wasn’t even an isolation player back then. He played off ball a ton. You’re substituting a roleplayer with a superstar.   3. A team making the finals and losing nearly a decade ago with different players, different opponents, different coaches and a different play style doesn’t mean the Nets offence isn’t going to translate. That would be like me saying “what happened to LeBron in 2011? See? He’s going to choke again”.   4. KD averaged 30 ppg in the finals against the Heat  5. That OKC team didn’t have anyone close to the shooter Joe Harris is to spread the floor if the stars get doubled  Nothing about your comparison makes sense"
"yes.  it cannot be anyone other than the nets.  this year was easy decisions.  i admit that but marks deserves it for the years leading up to today.  he made trades for 1st round picks...late picks at that, and nailed them.  levert and Allen. he then found Joe Harris who was cut elsewhere.  and dinwiddie from the gleague.  that all made getting kyrie and KD possible.  and nailing levert and Allen made a trade for harden possible.    look past the kyrie/kd/harden and marks deserves it"
"Joe Harris 19m/year Will Barton 13m/year, JRich 12/year,"
"The Nets have a lot of flaws as a team, they’re a good team yeah because Harden rarely misses game. As seen with the Rockets he’s capable of carrying a team to the playoffs, but past that? Not so much  What made them a super team other then having a big 3? Does Joe Harris make them a super team cause he’s not Klay, does DJ make them a super team cause he’s not Draymond"
Because Joe Harris would be the 3rd most valuable player on the Lakers
"Nets don't need LMA and Blake's skillsets, they just need them to contribute when Joe Harris/KD or Green/DJ are on the bench. Lakers actually need Drummond to rebound."
"You have Harden, KD, Kyrie, and Joe Harris all locked in until at least 2023, literally nobody thought that was a risky trade, any team in the league would do that in the blink of an eye."
"Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton are some of our best talent and they are homegrown/Marks picked them up years ago cause he's a good GM  we traded for Bruce Brown because Marks is good at finding talent. We have had other players like TLC and Chiozza for years.   Our other homegrown talent we traded for James Harden because well, no shit. Marks deserves credit, calling this team artificial isn't accurate when the GM is just really good"
"we traded our homegrown assets for James Harden. We still have Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, Nic Claxton as some of our best players, we forgetting how good Sean Marks is to get these talented players who have either been drafted or on the team for years?  We traded for Bruce Brown. Again Sean Marks being a genius. We made good signings to build roster and have other players like TLC, Chiozza, etc left over from previous years.   Blake and LMA are literally playing like 15 minutes a game max lol"
Because he didn’t play with James harden setting him up? Also Detroit’s spacing sucked. His dunk this year Joe Harris and shamet spaced the floor for him and we were 5 out
Joe Harris is polarizing ?
I mean have you seen the Nets when all superstar play + Joe Harris?
"If Joe Harris counts as an all star here so does fucking Danny Green and idk Lopez? Don’t get me wrong, Harris is a super valuable piece, but he’s not a perennial all star."
Its dumb aswell because both came in raw shooting wise from 3 and both are forced to play like they are joe harris which just takes away all their skills they have already. Beal is a pretty good offball player aswell so its not like they have to play like this for their star
"Im confused, did you just tell someone they don't watch basketball and then said you had some of the best role players in the league?  Um you kinda traded them away, in case you aren't aware. Allen, Prince, LeVert, Kurucs.  You only have like.. Jeff Green, Dinwiddie and Joe Harris who is like an icyhot with no defence..  lmao.."
"No 2 of our best players signed with. Kyrie and KD. Harden was traded, Bruce was traded, joe Harris was traded and Claxton was drafted. Blake is arguably equivalent to claxton"
"Harden.   He’s been the best facilitator, scorer, and leader so far and I think that’ll carry over.   Also it’s hilarious to see people put washed Blake, DJ, and LMA above or at the same level as Joe Harris. The disrespect.   When the playoffs come around, you’ll see why Joe Harris is easily the 4th best player on this team."
You definitely can leave off joe Harris lmfao
Joe Harris
Corey Kispert is 6’7” and is the third guy since ‘97 to shoot 50/40/90 in college (55/46/90 this year). His game is basically perfect for translating to the NBA. Could end up being somewhere between Joe Harris and Klay Thompson
"I loved ""The Jet"" and I think he could've made it in the east but likely as an injury replacement. Game back then was a bit balanced in terms of offense.   I also think he was more of an off-ball shooter but he could also score when needed but wouldn't compare him to someone like CJ like someone said below.   He honestly played a bit similarly to guys like Klay, Joe Harris, and maybe a poor mans version of Middleton. Also Josh Howard was arguably one of their second scoring options on those Mavs teams. That guy made the all star team over Terry back in like 2007."
"What the fuck are you talking about, Trae Young is head and shoulders above Joe Harris."
"Trae is not better than Joe Harris lol, any more than he's better than Klay Thompson"
"Trae Young is better than Joe Harris for many other reasons, the all star nom is just evidence"
I wonder if Aldridge is gonna be able to buy Joe Harris out of #12
One-year all-star noms don't count as making you an all-star for good. Is Trae Young better than Joe Harris since he made an all-star team over him last year?
"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's a totally valid opinion.  I would have thought the same a month ago but right now the Nets just look so offensively dominant.  Joe Harris could legitimately be a third option for any contender that has decent ball-handlers.  Deandre Jordan isn't great, but he also isn't trying too much. I would expect a marginal uptick from him in the playoffs. Jeff Green, Griffin and LMA aren't amazing but they all provide depth and versatility to the 4/5 spot.  Then you've got two guys who are top 10 scorers in the league: Kyrie and Harden.  I think they could win the East without KD, and I don't see any team beating them when they're at full strength."
"&gt;Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team.  That's not what you said. You said that we have 0 homegrown talent on the team, not players carrying the team. Stop shifting the goalposts.  &gt;You’re being downvoted because you’re acting like he created some amazing feat.  Going from being the worst team in the league, to title favourites in the space of 5 years is an incredible feat. I sense jealousy  &gt;You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. That’s it.  There's 30 teams in the NBA. It's not just the Knicks and Nets.   Brooklyn had no draft picks or young talent when Marks took over. He regained draft picks by taking on salary dumps (Zeller, Mozgov, etc.) attached with picks, and drafted very well, landing guys like LeVert, Allen and Claxton. He found some absolute hidden gems in the g-league in Harris and Dinwiddie, and took a chance on guys with high potential like DLo. He hired Atkinson as coach, who was terrific in developing these young guys, and making them play incredibly hard, fun basketball. Marks targeted 2019 offseason to make a splash in free agency, as he made enough space for 2 max players. Our change in culture, combined with our very promising young core, and respected coaching staff/front office made KD and Kyrie want to come here.  I can't tell if you're being intentionally ignorant or you're just salty. Why don't you educate yourself on everything Sean Marks has done as GM since he got the job in 2016. It's absolutely nothing to do with being ""straight lucky"". He's a guy that Popovich constantly talks about being one of the most intelligent individuals he's ever coached/worked with."
"Yes the Brooklyn nets are being carried by joe Harris, Spencer dinwiddie, and Nicolas Claxton. Definitely not the other players on your team. You’re being downvoted because you’re acting like he created some amazing feat. No. You were the only place that kd and Kyrie could come together that was better than the knicks. That’s it. Now you have a bunch of ring chasers chasing the ring this year that’ll inevitably come after harden forced his way out of Houston onto the nets. You had almost no rebuild. It was straight lucky"
"So Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie and Nicolas Claxton don't exist then?  Why the fuck have I been downvoted into oblivion for stating that our GM has done a terrific job rebuilding this franchise from absolutely nothing, to the best in the league? You people are so fucking delusional."
"People said “wait and see” last year and then the Lakers walked to a free ring with zero resistance lol. You’re telling me the Lakers with Bron, AD, Drummond, and whoever else they get and a team with fucking KD, Kyrie, Harden, Griffin, Joe Harris, and Aldridge aren’t gonna make the finals?"
"I just read a lot of Lakers fan wet dreams. Denis over Kyrie, cause Denis has such a positive history in the finals, while Kyrie doesn’t?? Thinks Griffin is the Nets 6th man? Ignores every other bench player on Nets. Thinks Lebron is covering Joe Harris?   I think this will be a great series, but this is the worst breakdown I think I’ve ever seen."
It is 3 but joe Harris and probably even old lma can give you 20 any random night
"If i had to take this kyrie or klay I'd take Kyrie, harden or steph i'd take harden. So to me at the top end talent this team is EVEN better than the bets team ever.  Then the suppporting cast, the GSW had Draw/Iggy/Mcgee/Bell/Livingstone/Young/West/Looney/Zaza/Mccaw The nets have Harris/Green/Jordan/Blake/LMA/Green/Claxton/TLC/Brown/Shamet/Roberson/Johsnon and an injured Dinwiddie.  I persoanlly don't think you can say the GSW roster is better, let alone MUCH better. They have THREE players who could legitimately have a shot at winning MVP this year if they had their own teams then you have joe harris shooting 50% from 3 and lemarcus aldridge at center....that starting lineup is straight up bonkers."
"&gt;If the two guys that joined the Nets apparently ruined the league aren’t even better than Joe Harris, surely it was a complete overreaction.  Joe Harris is one of the best shooters  in the game this year.  He is #3 in 3p%  and #6 in made 3s.   Shooting ~490 from three is bonkers, and he is doing it on high volume."
"Joe Harris, Claxton, and Green are easily better than kuzma, kcp, and the washed gasol"
"If the two guys that joined the Nets apparently ruined the league aren’t even better than Joe Harris, surely it was a complete overreaction."
Considering Joe Harris is a great player that isn't really saying much
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Blake  6. TLC 7. LMA 8. Deandre  9. Bruce Brown  10. Claxton   The bottom 4 is completely interchangeable though.
You can tell that people havnt watched  more than a few nets games when they leave Joe Harris out of conversations like this.   The dude is averaging 49% from 3 on 6.7 attempts a game while also being solid at everything else (including being great at finishing around the rim).   He’s like a top 3 three point shooter in the league and he’s the 4th option on offense.
1. KD 2. Harden 3. Kyrie 4. Joe Harris 5. Nicolas Claxton 6. Jeff Green 7. Bruce Brown 8. DeAndre Jordan 9. Blake Griffin 10. LMA
"He would be rooting for the Nets, not against them 😂  But it would be like, “Jaylen Brown is so bad, the Celtics should trade him to the Nets for Joe Harris so they can get over .500”"
I’d have joe Harris above Denis and Montrez tbh
Joe Harris should be number five if you’re ranking based on who helps you win basketball games the most
Is it wrong for me to say Joe Harris &gt; Schroeder
Joe Harris is shooting like 50% from deep on 7 attempts per game lmao
Joe Harris is a huge piece as well
Joe Harris is better than Blake and Aldridge at this point in their careers lol
God it’s like everyone fucking forgets Joe Harris
"I think the supporting cast is looking solid tho, Blake and Aldridge help a lot and Claxton is already one of the better defending centers in the league and then they have arguably a top 3 shooter in the league with Joe Harris. Defense will obviously be the big issue against both Philly and Milwaukee but both would be competitive series."
"Nah dude. Nets have 3 superstars, plus Joe Harris who I would take over anyone on the lakers besides Lebron and AD.  That team is ridiculously stacked"
All this to beat joe harris?
"Everyone hear thinking that LMA is going to get dominated at center are mistaken   He isn’t going to start at all and he will share minutes from DJ who would get dominated also by the same players.  Giannis and Joel  But who on those teams are going to stop Durant, Kyrie, Harden and to an extent Joe Harris and Griffin?  We have to stop them from dominating by one or two players.  They have to stop a whole team from dominating them.  7 players deep.     We can score 130 a game when healthy and our defense is only letting up 115.  The last 20 games.     The only legit teams that can square up are the 76ers and Jazz.  Those are the most consistent and most talented.   Everyone thinks the Nets can skate through and I’m thinking that the 76ers are going to make moves.     When Durant comes back you are getting the most efficient scorer in the league back.   So if he plays 20 minutes you know what you are getting and it’s snot stealing from a player.  Where as a Middleton or a Simmons has to match that production which is a huge increase in their normal efficiency.    You get put up Melo numbers and expect to be the Nets.  30-40 shots a game with a 30-40 split.     LMA is depth.  Reliable experienced Robert Horry depth that can score on the breathers"
Blake Griffin is literally a bench player and LaMarcus Aldridge has absolutely nothing to offer other than being a massive defensive liability and a guy who would steal touches from the superstars. Joe Harris is clearly the Nets 4th best player. It's a neat collection of names but the last two aren't needle movers in any way and that's why they were both available for literally nothing.
He turned down an extension of roughly 4-years/54 mil from the Blazers IIRC. He’s more than just a spot up guy even though that’s his main strength. The deal would be an investment with belief that he can become more of a shot creator as he’s shown good pull-up potential from deep and mid-range. He’s also no slouch on defense. With the Raps player development he could definitely become much more than your Joe Harris/JJ Reddick specialist type.
"So Nets deserve no credit for developing Joe Harris, Dinwiddie, Allen, LeVert, and Claxton from the late first, early second, and G League while still meaning flexibility to add two max contract guys?"
Plus Joe Harris and Dinwiddie
Because Blake and LMA took vet mins and people are completely overrating how good these guys still are because they have huge names? The ones that should worry you are Joe Harris and Claxton
"No idea, and Joe Harris couldnt do it.  Wilt’s career best season per100 sits at approximately 38 points.  After 5 minutes of research:  Kobe has surpassed it 4 times  Jordan has done it 11 times.  Harden has done it 4 times.  Iverson has done it 2 times.  T-Mac has done it 1 time.  KD has done it 4 times.  Gervin did it 2 times.  Shaq did it 6 times.  Isaiah Thomas did it 1 time.  Beal did it 2 times.  Westbrook did it 2 times.  So that’s 39 examples that I kinda randomly picked as examples. I might be wrong about 100 examples, but it can definitely go over 50."
Kyrie has played as many games for the nets as harden tho. And he’s putting up 28/5/6 on 52/40/89 with a net rating of +8.5 on 1110 mins - Joe Harris is at +7 on 1400 mins while harden is at +4.9 on 1200 minutes....
"yeah that is so wrong. The current nets have like five people who have been all stars before. A few who should be. Then you have guys like Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Nick Claxton who are great role guys. The heat or cavs never have that."
How much help does Joe Harris need
Damn... using all star appearance to justify Nets isnt that OP as it seems. Nets is probably the most stacked team in history.  Besides the 3 superstars they still have Joe Harris Blake Griffin and Aldridge lmao
Joe Harris exists
"I think it comes from their size and athleticism. They made teams throughout their lives due to their sharpshooting ability but often times the 3 point specialists are smaller and less athletic. Thinking of people like Seth Curry, JJ, Joe Harris for this one."
it's like people are blind to what Harden is doing for guys like Joe Harris and Claxton and even Blake now
Zion/BI are one of the highest scoring duos in the league rn. I think we just need to put more shooters around them. Just need to clone Joe Harris a couple of times and get cooking.
This is so disrespectful to Golden state lol and it seems like you’re unaware Joe harris was there before KD or kyrie? And I can’t tell if you’ve never watched Collins or LMA or both. Same with the other two
"nah i mean they have KD Kyrie Harden, a washed Griffin who can't defend, a washed LMA who can't defend,  and Joe Harris.  &amp;#x200B;  Good team, but not ""sweep everyone"" good"
"Because joe harris is their 4th best player, not blake, LMA or DAJ."
The nets shot pretty bad from 3 but Joe Harris I believe has also consistently shot below his average in most games against the sixers over his career.
Then that leaves Joe Harris wide open. Not to mention KD’s gonna get 25 regardless.
Which 2? You couldn’t stop Kyrie tonight and Green and DJ were still scoring. You did effectively shut down Joe Harris. But if you’re not stopping Kyrie you’re definitely not stopping KD. Not to mention Harden scoring/ play making.
"Agreed, this game was not very good for evaluating. The 5 players the Nets came back with will not be on the floor in the 4th quarter in the playoffs. I do know that we were able to abuse their defense when they had Kyrie, DJ, and Joe Harris on the floor, however I'm of no delusion we're going to be able to stop their big 3"
Simmons and thybulle could not even slow down kyrie.   No one is stopping KD. And even that would be enough to win. But then you get harden and a Joe Harris who will get open looks. And likely a double on embid leaving Simmons open.   I can’t see anyway that this goes well for the sixers.
"Is Prince actually consistent this year on whatever team is on now? I liked him when he played well and thought he was a solid defender, but he would keep missing 3s in cold streaks and wasn't a good enough decoy shooter for Joe Harris. Garrett temple was pretty much an all around better version of prince last year."
"Not sure man, Joe Harris is kinda nice with it"
Thybull contested a bunch &amp; Joe Harris might not have shot the ball. I like the sixers chances to get it done if the Nets think they’re just going to show up for the playoffs
Yeah you aren’t doing it for defense the foul problem stuff is definitely true though   Real question is whom do you put as your 5th guy if BKN with those 3 and Joe Harris. Pretend to still care about defense with like Bruce brown or just say fuck this and put in Landry Shamet and go all in on offense and spacing. Think at that point I would probably do the latter. Dont give Joel Embiid a natural matchup defensively
Get Joe Harris more shots pls
"Kyrie putting up 23/7 with like half the team sitting out against the 2nd best defense in the league...dude's playing out of his mind right now.  Would be nice if somebody would put a body on Tobias Harris. Joe Harris is getting bullied today. These physical teams are a bad matchup for him, he can't handle a talented scorer like Harris 1-1 and the Sixers are not letting him get those open looks off screens. And obviously really exacerbated by not having KD/Harden. He's gotta step up in the 2nd half"
Nets fans - Does Joe Harris not really work with Kyrie? I have him for fantasy and the difference in stats between him playing with Kyrie and him playing with either of Durant or Harden always seems significant.
The Nets should think of putting someone bigger on Harris. He's just targeting Shamet and Joe with impunity.
Joe Harris is food on defense
"Tough night for the ""Joe Harris is actually a good defender and if you dont agree it means you dont watch the games"" crowd."
Damn I thought redick was turnstile but joe Harris makes him look like a DPOY
sixers picking on Joe Harris
SETH CURRY  vs.  JOE HARRIS
My obvious bias (and hopeful thinking) aside I think the Nets are actually getting into dangerous territory here in terms of the lack of games a majority of their team will have together even if they get fully healthy. Has anyone on the roster besides Joe Harris played more than 50-60 games with the Nets over the past two seasons?
Joe Harris is their most reliable player
&gt; the best player in his team at creating for others on ball.  this is how I know you are quite misinformed. There is a reason draymond spends 90% of his minutes with Curry; he is diminished otherwise.  Draymond gets to play 4 on 3 because of steph and you think dray is the better playmaker? or that it make sense to contrast him vs other primary playmakers? Its nonsensical. Its like saying Joe Harris is a better 3pt shooter than dame because of %.
"Kyrie and Joe Harris vs Embiid and Simmons. Fuck it, I'll take it and hope it's a good game."
This screams of Joe Harris raining 3's all night.
"Y'all keep putting steph but who's he guarding? I guess you could put him on Joe Harris but I feel like that's against the point of the question. If the question is 3 guys who guard their Big 3, I think Kawhi Lebron AD is the answer"
Rest Joe Harris please. I’m worried about him.
You can’t double harden on this nets team. It worked against the rockets because Westbrook can’t shoot   If you double harden good luck stopping kyrie kd and joe Harris with 4th guy in a 4 on 3 situation
"people are already answering but I think Thybulle likely earns a lot of minutes in that matchup, he’s really good at keeping up with quick guards who can’t overpower him like Kyrie/Kemba/Fox/Lavine.  His offense is really rough, so he can’t match Kyrie’s minutes. I think we’ll see Danny Green on Kyrie at times too out of necessity, but he’ll probably be better on Joe Harris.  Just remembering we have George Hill, he’ll probably guard Kyrie for stretches, maybe Harden at times too."
"tbh last time we played the nets, everyone was out for Brooklyn. Levert and Joe Harris mopped us up."
Yea thats a good swap. Was thinking along the lines of pairing a knock down shooter with Harden and Jokic. Like a discount   Joe Harris for the nets
"Joe Harris is an outlier where the mental aspect probably plays a big role. just from looking at at Wilt’s form and his free throw shooting, there are zero indications that he would ever be a good three point shooter."
Joe Harris might be the only starter active tomorrow lmao. But have fun flexing on Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot
Hell no.   Wouldn't trade 3rd or 4th best either tbh. Joe Harris def brings a more valuable skill set when we have a better playmaker than Simmons in Harden.
"KD is So efficient and so effortless.   It has always impressed me how Durant, as incredible of a shooter he is, doesn't get a lot of shots from 3 like the rest of all time great shooters; but still end up so efficient in these kinds of games. In comparison, KD is shooting 5 3pa this season, while guys like Joe Harris are shooting 6,5 3pa. KD has shot around 5 3pa throughout virtually his whole career, but hasn't really tried to go full 3 point revolution. Don't get me wrong, KD is still one of the most broken cheat codes in terms of shooting, but you gotta give him props for staying dominant without having to alter his game like most are doing now. He breathes basketball. It's so natural for him. Sometimes, the talent is so jaw dropping, and that's what KD is."
"Mike James, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris are capable playmakers."
Uhhh joe harris? Jeff green? Shamet was pretty good?
"I swear, the Nets' fourth star is either Joe Harris or Jeff Green depending on the weather"
"Joe Harris, defensive juggernaut"
"Sean Marks did the following:  * Signed Joe Harris, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Magic and had gone 7 months without being picked up by another team * Signed Spencer Dinwiddie, a second round draft pick that was previously waived by the Bulls and was playing in the D league * Traded for Bruce Brown and Laundry Shamet by giving up a 2020 mid first round pick, a 2020 late second round pick, a player picked late second in 2019, and a player picked super late first round in 2018. The 2020 mid first round pick is the only player currently on an NBA team, Brown and Shamet are staples in the Nets rotation and will see significant playoff time while possibly even starting in a few games. * Signed Tyler Johnson, a player previously waived by the Suns that had gone 4 months without being picked up by another team"
"*To be fair*, MPJr in this stretch has had way more volume than Joe Harris or Ingles (again, 21PPG on 69%TS the past 35 games, 25PPG past 10 games), and SGA doesn't have Curry's volume OR efficiency..  If you put it that way, Curry vs Ingles, then my post looks dumb af haha"
"Like being a spot up shooter is a skill, but it’s like comparing curry vs Joe Harris or Joe ingles lol obviously the guy scoring efficiently off the dribble is much more impressive than the guy sniping off of assist"
"First team: OG, Smart, Jingles, Joe Harris, Mikal Bridges.  Second team: Capela, Crowder, Kleber, Covington, Fa$tPP - (no bias I swear)"
"No order: Joe Harris, Clint Capela, Joe Ingles, PJ Tucker  Number five I'm not sure of yet."
Joe Harris  Joe Ingles  Royce O'Neale  Robert Covington  Bobby Portis
"Raptor is a hybrid metric including both box score complexes and APM, which, yes, is based on box plus-minus. I never said it wasn't adjusted or altered, of course it is.  Context matters for RAPTOR. What 538 is interested in as a project is probabilities; with sports, their top priority is predicting game outcomes. So what RAPTOR really is at its core is the condition in a conditional probability matrix. What this means is that they are calculating PrA|C where A is Lakers beat the Magic and C is their relative RAPTOR ratings. All that is important here is its predictive ability - teams that win should have higher raptor totals, how they achieve those totals is irrelevant. AD could have his RAPTOR swapped with Kuzma and it wouldn't make a difference to the system's efficacy as a predictive tool.  This is the root of its problem as a rating for individuals. The success of a team must be distributed amongst the individual players; this is why all Jazz players rank strangely high. Important factors get lost in this: the strength of a coach is not evaluated, so their impact gets absorbed into the players. The increase in probablity that the Jazz wins by having Snyder as coach is distributed into Ingles, Clarkson, etc. Secondly, it does not evaluate the fit of the team together. A team may lose due to lacking complementary skillsets despite the genuine skill of its players. Thirdly, the raptors of worse teams must be deflated, so bad coaching/bad fit get absorbed by players. To predict the magic losing, you either had to siphon raptor from AG/Fournier or you had to cap Vucevic, or both. A cursoory glance at the player rankings shows the absurdity of using it for evaluating the skill of players/using it as a top player ranking. Joe Harris isn't better than Zion - the Nets are better than the Pelicans.  As someone who has had to study the foundations of probability systems too much, take my word: more complex formulas don't remove absurd results, they just make the absurdities more complex."
"agree, but joe harris &gt; clarkson"
"Joe Harris, Jae Crowder, Joe Ingles, Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green"
Joe Harris  Robert Covington
did joe harris die?
"What’s your definition of a role player? If it’s just a non-All Star without high usage (so not like a CJ McCollum), players like Mikal Bridges as you mentioned, and others like Joe Ingles, Serge Ibaka, Joe Harris, and Brook Lopez (who’s just a role player now) are all solid. Basically these guys would help any team but don’t require super high usage."
"let me clarify u/puffx0r and u/makaveli80  I watched every game Harden has played in Houston. I didn't have a team and started following them after.  I didn't say his teamates were bad. I said overall the team had below average OFFENSIVE players. Or the players were extremely one dimensional  A great example is PJ Tucker. With the spacing of D'Antoni and Harden's scoring gravity and creation he got some of the easist possible three pointers, wide open corner 3's. That is literally the only thing he is capable of doing, he is well below league average above the break, his jumper isn't fast. He has an incredibly rudimentary handle, can't pass and bc he is groundbound and slow he has to shoot a tough low percentage floater instead of a layup  How did PJ look offensively without Harden and D'antoni? 4.4 pts on 36.6% from the field and 31.6% from three. All numbers are a career low.  We saw the limitations of the role players against the best defense in the league with the Lakers. When they doubled Harden the team was in trouble. They were comfortable shooting contested threes, attacking the closeouts, passing, cutting or finishing. Same issues against the zone looks.  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  To be clear there have been some good offensive role players like Ryan Anderson, but they were still limited. He went defense first on his minimum salary guys  How many role players were clearly above average at multiple thing offensively in the las few years? Eric Gordon, Jeff Green and maybe Danuel House. Let me know if I'm forgetting someone  It's not just Joe Harris. Shamet, Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are all very good, and versatile role players on offense"
"The most impressive part about all of this has been how little the Harden, KD, and Kyrie actually have played together. Shout out to Joe Harris for being the glue"
"its funny...if any other player hits even 1 of the shots these 2 routinely make, you would call it luck.  if jj Redick or Joe Harris hit a shot like Luka's game winner, you'd maybe say its 25% skill and 75% luck but steph and Luka, you'd be surprised they dont hit it again"
"Homer here but because I watch all of the raptors games, it’s Lowry.  The shit he does, the timing of his aggression, his defensive willingness to win, it’s all the intangibles and when you see the team with him on vs off the court it’s so clear that the guy is a winner.   Also - demars assist game is developing so well. Impressive.   KAT is so fucking good. His 3pt shooting alone is elite. But everyone shits on the guy constantly. If he was a laker he’d be sucked off by half this sub  Joe Harris is obvs having a career year thanks to all the spacing he’s getting, but for that team to be able to chuck the ball around a little bit and dump it out to Harris is ludicrous.   He’s always hurt but Gordon Hayward is such an integral part of winning. Boston misses his playmaking and outside shooting clearly. And he’s helped Charlotte become a winning team.   Clint capela - without him Atlanta is in the play in. His rebounding, offensive in particular, keeps them alive."
"&gt; Zaza played 18 MPG. Why even include him in this data set?  I suppose for the same reason you include Looney, who played even fewer minutes.  &gt; Dude defensive stats aren’t some end all be all Jesus Christ lol they mean close to nothing, but being on a good defensive team will have your stats rise. He didn’t deserve all defense in 17, everyone who made it over him were better defenders. I’m not wrong, kd is not an elite defender and if he was this Brooklyn team would be better at D but they aren’t. You’re wrong. Bye.  I included defensive stats for you, because I’m assuming you watched fewer Warriors games than I did (you did).  KD can be (or at least was) an elite defender when he chooses to be, I’ve seen it.  If you haven’t, you haven’t been watching or don’t know what to look for.  But you seriously think one good defender at SF is going to turn Brooklyn into a decent defense?  They have Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin’s exoskeleton and the corpse of DeAndre Jordan on defense with Joe Harris coming off the bench for heavy minutes.  Even if KD were putting in an effort (he isn’t) there is no player in NBA history that turns that into a decent defense.  Come playoffs the Sixers (or whoever) are going to run over them."
"That's just wrong. We have had really bad players some years, yes, but we have also had players like Clint Capela, Chris Paul, Westbrook, Eric Gordon (when he was playing well). They are not below average roleplayers. Also PJ tucker was absolutely deadly with the corner 3. Maybe not as good as Joe Harris but he was still above league average."
"Yea that's why I'm super excited about the playoffs. Like yes, the Nets defensive rating is pretty poor, and defense wins championships, but the Nets offense have made every top 10 defense look as bad or worse than the Net's haha. We've had a couple of stinkers, but throughout the season if the Nets have at least 2 stars active the whole game, it's gonna be a high scoring affair no matter the defense you play.  Also, if Harden just had a Joe Harris caliber shooter his entire Rockets career, a 45-50% dead eye sniper who can stay healthy and nails every open 3, I think the Rockets play style could've been quite different."
I cant believe Nurse sent a double at him at around 2 minutes left... It led to OG having to choose between guarding Joe Harris or Kevin Durant wide open on the 3 pt line haha
"Joe ""Just a Shooter"" Harris with 6 assists and really good defense  Nets with 7 out of 8 players scoring double digits, none of which were Kyrie Irving lol  I love Jeff Green so much, if we win a ring he will damn sure have earned his"
I wouldn’t wish having to choose between closing out on KD and Joe Harris on my worst enemy.
You legit have Kawhi for B and Joe Harris for A 💀
"Thank you Joe Harris, very cool"
"i get what you’re saying and it’s completely valid. but it doesn’t apply to every scenario. would you rather have joe harris (~15 ppg on great efficiency) or CJ mccollum (~22 ppg on good efficiency)? if you want to bring up defense, the same question could be asked with lu dort vs MPJ, for example.  there is no clear definitive answer. it depends on the team. however, harden’s team needed him much more than giannis’. if MVP always went to the most valuable player, it should’ve been harden. i know it typically goes to the best player on the best team, which was giannis, so i didn’t think the 2019 “snub” was as bad as 2017 for example. I’m more mad that harden couldn’t hit the game winner in the final game of the season against okc (he had an open look). that would’ve made them top 2 seed and if harden didn’t get it after that i would’ve been raging."
"Actually surprised, joe harris is at ~400 attempts, curry is at ~650"
" &gt;Blake Griffin flanked by two mobile, switchable 7-footers (Durant and Claxton) will defend Embiid as well as any other contender.    &gt;...  &gt;When Blake’s tired, they’ll throw DeAndre flanked by Durant and Green.   This is exactly what I'm saying though. The Nets can't play six guys at once, so if they're playing Blake and Claxton or DeAndre and Green, that means there are only three other spots on the court for their three stars plus Joe Harris (not to mention those lineups with two bigs won't have ideal spacing).  In a competitive playoff series, you want your stars getting 40+ minutes. If they're relying on two other bigs at a time to contend with Embiid, it squeezes their rotation in a way that doesn't allow them the spacing they'd otherwise like to have. They can't play three stars plus Harris plus two bigs all at once. They can stagger, but ideally their stars wouldn't be on the bench that long anyway."
Replace Joe Harris with Bron and we'll talk
"I would say team B because of star power but I don't know how you guard A's offense when Jokic has the ball and you got Steph, Klay and Joe Harris running around, especially with Harden, Kawhi and KD who I don't think can chase players around screens like Ben Simmons can (different levels between the three, obviously. I'm not putting them on the same plane)."
Joe Harris
"Team A easily, Joe Harris better shooter than Kawhi"
B bruh how did Joe Harris get in 😂
"MPJ is more Klay or Joe Harris than he is KD lol. Even pre-injury he was stiffer than KD, and that didn’t help.  But yeah, the Nuggets could be legit if they keep this trio together."
"If you take into account volume, curry sits right at 3 SDs above the mean in terms of ""fantasy impact on 3pt%"" I guess you would call it.  Joe Harris is the league leader at 4.34 SDs above the mean and Joe Ingles second at 3.50 SDs above the mean. Curry sits third.  Harris and Ingles shoot nearly 50% from 3, curry sits at 42.7% on twice the volume however."
Joe Harris isn't on the Timberwolves
"Minutes Played for these teams  Curry (1808), Doncic (1898), Kawhi (1581), Giannis (1713), Jokic (2115)  *Fun fact: these guys are 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th (Luka) on 538's RAPTOR*  Harden (1558), Lillard (1978), LeBron (1388), Zion (1814), Embiid (1316)  *Fun fact: Multiple commenters saying maybe Harden shouldn't make it because he's missed too many games ignoring that he's still 200 minutes ahead of currently-out LeBron and Embiid and only barely behind Kawhi in minutes played. Different position granted, but that's a double standard. Why should some players be able to play significantly less and make the all-NBA team? Yes, LeBron and Embiid are beasts when they play, but Harden's still an amazing player, even if he doesn't need to score as much anymore.*  Kyrie (1585), CP3 (1872), PG13 (1548), Randle (2251!), Gobert (1833)  *Randle currently leads the league in minutes, which Jokic just behind.

we're trying that Korver Joe harris role with windler but he's being injury prone.
Joe Harris-Joey buckets? Joe headband? Lumber Joe?
Joe Harris is Joey Buckets - what is this Beef Jerky Joe crap lmao
Laundry Shamet. He is going to go nuclear one playoff game and hit like 7 or 8 threes.  The obvious answer is Joe Harris but I consider him slightly more than just a role player at this point.
can’t believe Silver let the nets get shamet *and* joe harris
Joe Harris
1. I could make the same point and say those teams can’t guard Kyrie Harden KD and the gravity of Joe Harris at the same time. Embiid and Giannis would have to average damn near 50 to outscore the big 3  2. There is a 99% chance the Bucks and Philly are not gonna face the Nets in the first round
inb4 Joe Harris/Griffin vs Schroder/KCP duo match up for 7 games.
Lmao exactly ... especially when you got Joe Harris in the corner waiting to let it fly
"Yeah, and I’m more scared of Joe Harris than Kyrie on catch and shoot 3s. Are you dense or something?"
"The same thing is happening with the Nets though.   People are talking about “overpowered role players” like... Jeff Green, Claxton, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin."
When Harden and KD are dribbling the air out of the ball there is no difference between Kyrie and Joe Harris.
"Because people like rooting for underdogs most of the time. Our team is full of guys that other teams gave up on or just play with a chip on their shoulder. If the Nets win it all, it's not going to be some feel good story. It's just a team that managed to put three superstars together and tried to beat other teams just on offensive firepower. Even the first iteration of the Warriors superteam was more fun because those guys were all drafted by the team. The Nets just kinda feel like other guys playing in Nets jerseys. Is Joe Harris the only guy left from those underdog Nets teams?"
Dude I was watching Joe Harris today and even he somehow was playing really solid defense. Impressive what Nash and the crew has done on that end given their history and the roster
"His team isn’t BAD at all, but it isn’t playing next to Harden/KD. Joe Harris and Claxton are very good players too.  It’s not a “what if” I don’t think it’s coincidence Kyrie is having a career year playing next to two of the top 5 offensive players of this decade."
"Nor should you. Imagine how different Steve Novak’s life would have been had he been born 10-15 years later. 6’10” tall knockdown shooter, he’d been making Joe Harris money easily! Teams would be lining up to sign him."
Nobody can guard Kyrie KD and Harden. Teams can barely guard Jeff Green and Joe Harris. I doubt Embiid can keep up with the nets scoring
This offense is unstoppable. Try doubling any of Harden/KD/Kyrie in the playoffs and you'll just give up a Joe harris three or an open dunk.
And Joe Harris
"I didn't watch Joe Harris play much before this season. I realized all the analysts who were critical of the size of his extension ""because all he does is shoot threes"" must have seen as little of him as I had. He's been a much better basketball player than what he was portrayed as when that new contract was talked about in the media."
"Kyrie, Kd and Harden it's ok. but Joe Harris too, it's just unfair."
"No team is stopping Kd, Kyrie, Harden and Joe Harris defensively"
oh i forgot. they have joe harris too.. wtf man
"They have to leave joe Harris open in the corner, a 50% 3 point shooter lol"
BOARD MAN BUT ITS JOE HARRIS BABYYYY
they’ve got Joe Harris on the floor yet no ones trying to get him a good shot
Pretty sure all of them are mixed except for Joe Harris lol
Joe Harris putting up his hand to say “my bad” reminds me of something JJ Redick used to say on his podcast about that “yeah no shit everybody saw you get blown by putting your hand up isn’t doing anything” lol
I always wonder how Steph would shoot if he only took the shots that like Joe Harris or Joe Ingles take. 60%???
Everyone needs a Joe Harris OG Anuboby
"Whoever gets the best look is going to take the shot. And someone will get an easy look if KD, Kyrie and Harden are on the floor especially with Joe Harris spacing the floor.  Overcomplicate small issues to gas up potential “problems” all you want, I’ll trust having two (arguably 3) All-NBA players on the court doing their thing.  The better narrative to bemoan about is our defense. Stick with that."
"and Joe Harris but yeah, both of those are ++ elite shooters too and (Joe Harris especially) get way more quality looks"
Joe Harris
Joe Harris has 393 attempts and is shooting .483...
"i mean at the time you had an overweight dude from Serbia who had come off of a good year playing in Serbia and who had averaged 3.5 assists. So basically he was closer to a normal center with good passing fundamentals.   Even in his first year in the league you had a guy that was doing 2.4 assists, and while he was very good, was there indicators of him becoming the kind of player he is today (I didn't watch Denver back then). Like even the per 36 numbers his rookie year didn't show that court vision potential off.   For every Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic you end up with a Darko Milicic or Dragan Bender, it's a total crap shoot dealing with the draft and to call these guys idiots when they still had the idea to draft and pick him up still shows that someone viewed him as a prospect with potential.   You can't predict how a player will develop over time, it's pretty idiotic of you to say that these guys are idiots considering they literally have to evaluate 100+ potential players every year that may be worth picking up. 2014 was a draft of underrated gems, Joe Harris and Jerami Grant were both second rounders, Dwight Powell who just put on a show last night with Luka went after Jokic. Potential 6MOTY Jordan Clarkson went at 46. Clint Capela at 25, there were so many great prospects that were drafted all across the board not to mention guys like LaVine and Julius Randle going later in the first round. Everyone is going to remember 2014 for being the a low key bust for the biggest prospects from Wiggins and Parker when in reality it's going to go down as a sleeper draft where some truly elite players went very late in, likely a very difficult draft to call."
"I know ESPN RPM is kinda a fucked stat, but I cant get over Joe Harris as the best defensive SF in the league and a negative on offense. Like what?"
"To be top 6, he’d have to be better than guys like Derozan, Norm Powell, MPJ, Deandre Hunter, Grant, Bogdonovic, Barnes, Joe Harris and Hayward."
Blake over 45% 3 pt sharpshooter Joe Harris?
Joe Harris is the guy at Ace Hardware who doesn't even know what aisle the screwdrivers are in
Joe Harris is a pretty good finisher and a good mid range shooter.
Duncan Robinson is a bum    Joe Harris is a Walmart Klay Thompson
Joe Harris🤝Marc Gasol  I just work here
"On offense I think it's really important, to learn what player fit the best with each other, to see what coach would fit with the personel etc.  Defensively besides MAYBE for centers, analytics are pretty bad, there isn't one advanced stat on defense that I trust one bit : Joe Harris is 4th in defense RPM, Randle, Harrell, Vucevic and Jokic are top 20 in defensive win shares for example"
Nope. Joe Harris is the MVP
Joe Harris is also excellent at this. Hands up but a literal turnstile that doesn’t stop anyone

"it would get very ugly very quickly for the clippers unless they adjust their offensive approach   Clippers are a jump shot team and theres no world in which you out shoot a team with KD, Kyrie, Harden and even Joe Harris"
"LMAO at that top 5 list, lemme fix it for you pal  Joe Harris, Joe Ingles, Joe L Embiid, Jo Bamba, and Poku"
Curry Klay Dame Joe Harris Jokic
"I mean you can handwave it all away because of KD, Kyrie and Harden but the Nets absolutely made some great moves in the past few seasons. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen just off the top of my head are/were awesome players for them and helped get them to where they are today."
Joe Harris (butthurt)
Joe Harris (Painful posterior)
"No need to talk so fancy, just say ""Joe Harris (butt cheek hurts)"""
"&gt; The Nets have the most pressure and it isn't close.  I agree with that but they also have almost no control over anything this offseason.  It's two years with Kyrie, Harden, and KD.  If it doesn't work they may all walk away.    But if they fail hard this year, they're still pretty stuck.  Breaking up the Big 3 or trading Joe Harris would be dumb.  They're not getting anything great back for Jordan.  An S&amp;T for Dinwiddie is about the best move they can make, but that's not gonna return much at all coming off the ACL tear so he may just opt in anyways.  Basically it's a very different kind of pressure, because they're running this same team back next year either way.  Less offseason pressure, more in-season pressure for next year.  Sixers are kind of the complete opposite.  They can do almost anything this offseason and the only sacred cow is Embiid.  They can of course just choose to run it back either way, but they can't waste a lot of seasons with Embiid while he's (relatively) healthy."
"Joe Harris is absolutely better now than 37/38 year old Ray Allen, and Battier was also old (34/35) and was maybe negligibly better than Green was.  And you mention Kyrie being redundant but don’t talk about Wade being redundant with Lebron? Lol silly. Bosh routinely disappeared in big games too. The Nets roster is absolutely better than the Heatles."
"Nets will probably win. Too much firepower.   They don't have enough people to bother all three of KD, Kyrie, and Harden. And if they get the ball out of their hands it'll just end in a wide-open Joe Harris 3. Really tough to ask them to win."
"Joe Harris doesn't qualify for the knicks lead because he doesn't play for the knicks....Frank does though, and he was the most efficient 3pt shooter on the team by a decent margin."
"DeMar leaves, Kispert comes in, and I think all of our young guys look way better with an elite shooter around them. even if his peak potential is Joe Harris, these guys would be unreal with Joe Harris. the team needs ONE real knockdown guy who moves off ball behind the line. Lonnie can get hot but when he's cold, he's ice cold.  DJ would get SO many more assists if he wasn't playing next to Jakob, DeMar, and Keldon lol I really hope we keep Dieng, too. he's honestly so perfect for our guys, and I like his vibe. he's much better than you'd expect."
He doesn’t qualify for example. Joe Harris led the nba in 3 point percentage even though his was worst than Frank. And Frank ts is atrocious
What would Currys 3% be if he played a Joe Harris role? 55%?
"If you look at the 3 ball roleplayers around the league, they all do this. It seems like every time I watch a Nets game Joe Harris is spotting up from 28 feet."
Bertans a 100 percent isn’t worth that contract. Joe Harris who signed a similar deal is worth that much.
"You need both. A popular/current example is Kyrie and Harden's shooting seasons. Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season, the gold standard for shooting, yet Harden still had the higher TS%, cuz of their shot distributions.   Another example is 3pt shooting, where a 3 and D player who only shoots catch and shoot 3s will have a higher percentage than someone who takes pull up 3s but no sane person is saying Joe Harris is a better 3pt shooter than Steph"
"Oh yeah, I was just saying I don’t think last year was a flash in the pan for Bertans, I could see him getting back to it (especially if they fire Brooks and hire someone who can develop an offense). I would absolutely not worry about paying Robinson in the neighborhood of Bertans or Joe Harris (4yr/$72m - kinda underpaid, at least compared to Bertans). I think people underestimate how important spacing coupled with offball movement is, and overestimate how much $18-20 million/year is in the modern NBA - there’s like 80 guys making that money this year. You’d expect a contending team to have 3-4 guys making at least that much. For a team like Miami that’s worth it."
Joe Harris going 0-for-11 from 3 incoming...
"I'll defend it.  Joe Harris got a contract almost as big. Spacing is pretty important, high gravity shooters open up everything else.  Bertans maybe is not living up to the contract but I don't remember a whole lot of people bitching about it at the time."
"Joe Harris is also a great cutter, and he can playmake too. Hell he can get to the rim and finish on his own if he's got a good opportunity."
Joe Harris gotta be in there
"As a Nets fan I give every series opponent at least 1 game. I have to given the defense concerns. Like yes we have incredible offense and unlikely that all KD, Harden and Kyrie all have a bad shooting night with Joe Harris in the wings but it is possible and given we play only good defense inconsistently I think every playoff opponent can win at least 1."
"Hmm I don't think so, I'm pretty sure Joe Harris plays for the Magic but nice try"
He's much more comparable to Joe Harris.
Yea they have joe harris
"That's not an insult. They were contenders and hope to continue to be contenders in the future. The Heat are a smart team, signing Robinson to big money isn't a shrewd move.  Robinson in 2020 on a rookie deal is not the same as Robinson in 2022 making 17-22 million.    And Joe Harris is a separate conversation. Putting aside who is the better player, the Nets are on another tier compared to the Heat. The Nets had 2 top 15 players (added a 3rd after) and didn't have the roster flexibility to add anyone else since they were capped out. The options were keep Harris or nothing. Even if the value isn't perfect, having an elite role player on a clear title favorite with 3 bonafide superstars makes a lot of sense. It's a roster you want to lock in.    As for the Heat, they have some roster flexibility this off-season. As much as I like Bam and Butler, the current team isn't good enough to lock into. You mention adding a max player, but the only options are Lowry and DeRozan this year. Herro will need to be paid soon. I just don't see it as a good long term move for them."
There’s nowhere to hide against the nets. They’ll put him on joe Harris but then he just sets screens for harden and that either ends up in harden getting a switch or open shots for Harris
Joe Harris does a lot more than just shoot
That's assuming that during the first game he's not going to punch Joe Harris in the nuts and get suspended for the series
The flip side is you can look at Joe Harris and not sweat paying a 40% high volume 3 point shooter
I remember a good chunk of people on here arguing that this was a better contract than Joe Harris.
"YOU BETTER NOT LET JOE HARRIS INBOUND THE BALL, YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN"
"Scott is on an expiring contract so it was 8 of Embiid, Harris, Simmons, Hill, Curry, Milton, Thybulle, Clark, Maxey and Joe. Pretty sure Embiid, Harris, Simmons, Hill, Curry, Milton, Thybulle and Maxey are the top 8."
Same thing with Joe Harris. They see white guys that can shoot and assume that’s all they do lol
Joe Harris would be another Larry Bird at all star weekend if he wanted to defend his crown as the three point god but he’s already checked that box off of his bucket list. Now he’s going for Steve Kerr’s all time 3PT%.  (He’s currently 4th all time in 3pt%)
Does Bruce know Joe Harris better than he knows himself? It sure seems so
"Fun fact... Joe Harris is good friends and still hangs out with a lot of his college friends, who are mostly semi nerdy / semi douchy NYC finance people.     I love imagining Joe going from practicing and hanging out with Kevin Durant, Kyire, Harden straight to a bar with a bunch of people no different than any of my own friends and doing the same shit we did in the city"
Behind Blake and Joe Harris
Then why joe harris doesnt attempt 100 3pa per game? He will make 47.5 3pt = 142.5 points per game making him the GOAT.   He can practice 3pt hard everyday as well.
"I assume most teams could do a long chain backwards connecting players. i.e., Joe Harris to Brook Lopez to Vince Carter to Jason Kidd to Kerry Kittles to Yinka Dare to Kenny Anderson and so on and so forth."
"True, but one game it took a monumental choke job, capped off by Joe Harris turning it over in the coffin corner leading to the Russ 3.  We have since stopped using Joe for inbounds passes lol.  And don't think we were complete yet.  Also, the days of us giving up 130-150 nightly are gladly behind us as DJ is riding the bench more."
"The Cavs drafted (and let go of) Joe Harris and Danny Green, who both turned out to be some of the better 2nd round picks ever honestly. If only they were as good at 1st round picks. *cough* Dion Waiters *cough*"
"Joe Harris is a better pure shooter even though Harden is obviously a better ISO scorer, better scorer overall, better passer, etc."
"Its not shooting. If you take lets say the top 30 % wise shooters in the league and put them all in a 3pt shooting contest with these 5 guys for say 500 shots whoever can hit the most. I bet more than likely one of the other top 30 guys comes out on top. (Just due to the field size)   The difference is in other things. Speed of release, tricks to get free the stamina to literally RUN around the court around multiple off-ball screens and shoot in the .5s of free air space you got, handle, craftiness, nerves of steel. Reggie and Curry both have insane release times and literally run around the court, Steph's a decent threat to drive with a soft touch also and his handle is good. Bird might be the craftiest player who ever played the game. Also the team dynamic for these guys (well other than bird) was set up in a way to give them multiple off-ball screens and ways to get free, Klay and Steph being on the same team is kinda ridiculous given that 1 off ball double screen and a swing or two will always have one guy free.   Its not that like a Joe Harris etc. isn't as good a ""Reps"" shooter...its that Joe Harris aint getting free to shoot 12 3's a game cuz his other skills, his quickness, his 1st step, his craftiness etc aren't nearly on the same level"
Joe Harris has the highest 3pt % over the last 3 years min 100 attempts around 44%

but the quality of those looks is so vastly different. Like it’s much easier for me to believe that Harden could replicate Joe Harris’s stats if he was playing in Joe Harris-like role than vise versa
"Sooooo....Joe Harris eclipsed him in 3P%, 3PA, and 3PM (not to mention games played and minutes played). Why does Ingles age make it a more impressive feat? Shooting mechanics aren't really affected by age."
Joe Harris won the 3-point shooting title this year with a .475% and congrats to him. I dont mean to take anything away from Joe Harris as he is an incredible shooter and deserves all the praise he receives. Joe Ingles had quite the season in comparison.   **Joe Ingles -**  33 years old  Minutes played = 1867  3 Point % = .451  3’s attempted = 406  3’s made = 183 total (2.3 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  **Joe Harris -**  29 years old  Minutes played = 2141  3 Point % = .475  3’s Attempted = 444  3’s Made = 211 total (3.1 per game)  &amp;#x200B;  Not bad for an undrafted player who was waived by the Clippers in 2014. The Utah Jazz gave him a chance and the rest is history.  I also found this interesting..  &amp;#x200B;  **Utah Jazz All-Time 3-Pointers Made Leaders:**  &amp;#x200B;  1- Joe Ingles – 993 (7 Seasons)  2- John Stockton – 845 (19 Seasons)  3- Donovan Mitchell – 726 (4 Seasons)
"NOLA needs spacing more than anything, followed closely by defense. Once they move Adams/Bledsoe's money to Zion's extension, they need a 3&amp;D SG and a 3&amp;D C. Lonzo is their 3&amp;D PG. They'd be going backwards by letting him go.   Something like Lonzo/Joe Harris/Ingram/Zion/Myles Turner would be filthy, and plays perfectly to Zion and Ingram's strengths. If the Nets blow it up in a few years, it might even happen"
&gt; **The Deadshot Award (presented by Ray Allen/Reggie Miller)** &gt;  &gt; best qualifying 3 point percentage (Basketball-Reference): &gt; &gt; 1.    Joe Harris (47.5%) &gt; 2.

Shot difficulty is a factor and leads to lower percentages. It's why you didn't put Joe Harris in your post either.
i mean when you have 2 mvps and an all star and joe fucking harris. you will be WIDE OPEN af
Joe Harris threes??
Joe Harris is the best shooter out of all 5 of them
"Joe Harris is the best shooter on the team by far. It's like the Iguodala meme except for real, I'd rather have him shooting the last shot than anyone else."
Joe Harris definitely has an argument
"He’s been their rock this year with Harden, KD and Kyrie all missed time.. Joe Harris is the main constant..  I love that his game evolves more than just a catch and shoot guy. He’s a better defender than the likes of JJ Redick, Kyle Korver and Duncan Robinson  He can put the ball on the floor and dribble into a mid range shot or drive, can play make a little bit of catch and shoot scenario"
"As great a shooter as Harden is, I still think Joe Harris is better  he lead the league twice in percentage while shooting 5+ threes a game  Obv Harden is a better shooter than Green though"
"Everyone knows how good kyrie, harden, and kd are. And the fact that you can go and try to guard these guys which means joe Harris could be open is wild. They’re unguardable when fully healthy"
Yeah but it's not like Joe Harris wasn't doing this before.  He did this 2 years ago
"As someone who's only seen Joe Harris be trash in the 3pt contest, how good is he really?"
"Her too, but mostly Joe Harris - 47.5% vs 45.1%, 444 attemps vs 406 attempts, 6.4 shots per game vs 6.1 shots per game"
"The rough thing is that if you make life tough for Harden he is a top 5 passer in the league and can dish it to KD, Kyrie, or Joe Harris"
It's sad what ESPN did to RPM last year after the guy who created the stat left the company.  Aren't they embarrassed to publish an impact metric that has Jordan Poole in the top 10 in ORPM ahead of Jokic? Or that has Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson as top 10 in DRPM
"That stuff is just talk by the heads on TV. They all know that James Harden orchestrating an offense that includes KD and Kyrie (not to mention Joe Harris and a collection of solid NBA players) is going to crush teams. But the heads on TV can't just all be saying that. Richard Jefferson just tells it like it is though. If the big three is healthy, nobody is beating the Nets in 7 and there might be a good number of sweeps along the way."
"I’m just saying, that guy was referring to Joe Harris as a 50% 3-pt shooter as if he doesn’t have other major flaws that will be front wide and center come playoff time."
"People always say this but I doubt it. It’s Stephs volume and efficiency that makes him so impressive. Players have the efficiency like Joe Harris or the volume like Harden, but never both. Look at Trae, I doubt he’ll ever be a 40%~ 3pt shooter."
"I mean, he has the 2nd most 3 pointers made in a season ever. If it wasn't for a guy named Steph, he would have the 1st and 2nd most made in a season. The difficulty was insane those years too.   But lets look at a top 10...  1. Steph  2. Dame  It gets debatable after that in no particular order  3. KD 4. CJ 5. Duncan 6. Redick 7. Joe Harris 8. Seth Curry 9. Paul George 10. Kyrie  Not sure I put Harden in top 10 of simply ""shooter"" either. I guess ahead of PG or CJ?   Guys who could be top 10 if you swapped any of those out... Harden, MPJ, Ingles?"
Joe Harris
Joe Harris 😤
"Nah, Joe Harris is lights out from three."
"They made the playoffs before getting Kyrie and KD.   Traded for D'lo, the rights to Lavert, signed Dinwiddie when he might've been out of the league, signed Harris when he might've been out of the league and drafted Jarett Allen.   They did a GREAT job at turning it around after one of the worst trades ever, what the fuck are you talking about? They put out a sufficient product to get KD and Kyrie to sign, we don't know if they sign there if the Nets are a 15th place team and have no one to put around them. Before the Harden trade people talked about the Nets not only having KD and Kyrie but having a deep roster.  Signing guys who were barely making NBA teams and developing them was huge, Joe Harris is one of the best 3-pt shooters in the league now after getting waived by the Magic. Dinwiddie while injured currently, is a great backup PG and is good enough to start on some times.   Having LaVert and Allen allowed for them to trade for Harden. They didn't just luck into the position they're currently in."
"Obviously there was a lot of luck involved getting their stars, but let's not forget the 18-19 season where they were 6th in the East with All-Star D'Angelo Russell and supplemented by dudes they drafted late like Jarrett Allen and Caris Levert, or traded for like Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Yes the FO massively fucked up the Celtics trade, but it's not like they've been totally sitting on their ass since"
Makes sense since they have a week off afterwards (plus yesterday was a 1 pm tip and today is a 7 pm tip both at home).   I wonder of Joe Harris is playing. I'd like to see the full strength rotation at least once before the playoffs. We still haven't seen it.
"Joe Harris' non-free throw shooting this season (.505 overall, .475 on 3's) has been really good as well.  Kyrie's season has been tremendous - one of the very under-the-radar seasons that will probably get looked at more favorably over time."
Nets do not have Joe Harris but your point still stands I suppose
Joe Harris’ little brother
He only threw that thang back on the first one really... maybe 1-2 more. The others... especially the Joe Harris one were defenders running his ass over
The 2nd one in the video against Joe Harris is a clear defensive foul. A lot of the other ones are clearly bullshit though.
Danny Green - Cavs  Joe Harris - Cavs
"They're an offensive cheat code  Joe Harris is clearly, a member of the big 4"
"We made a playoff team with no 1sts to get KD/Kyrie, then found value in players no one wanted like Joe Harris and other random draft picks.  Even when we got harden people said ""ThEy TrAdEd AlL tHeIr TaLeNt"""
Fucking joe Harris built a super team
Joe harris over 12.5 pts is literally free money.
Having Joe Harris on top of the Big-3 just makes it absurd. Nobody is stopping them. This is beyond unfair.
Knicks desperately need a Joe Harris lol
The only likeable guy on this team is joe Harris
"You can check my comment history and see that I’m definitely not a Kemba cheerleader, but you’re wild if you think Joe Harris is better than him."
"I honestly think we could, but also we can't score so it wouldn't matter.  Fred or Lowry on Kyrie, OG on Harden, Siakam on Durant. I'm sure someone like Joe Harris would end up cooking us though."
Plus Joe Harris is 6-6 with a high release point and relatively unbothered by contests. How is 6-2 Bryn Forbes supposed to really bother him?
"Khris will clamp Joe Harris like he’s been clamping Duncan Robinson. Have him play that same role on D guarding the elite spot up guy. Pat has the foot speed to try to keep up with kyrie, jrue can maybe guard harden. Giannis and pj alternating on kd."
"Have khris stick to Joe Harris like he’s been clamping Duncan Robinson. Play Giannis, pj, jrue, pat and khash in the clutch and go for offensive boards to offset their efficiency."
Def much needed not just for kyrie but also for joe Harris if they get switched. I feel this really complicates things for them but I still have the bucks over the nets.
"I think problem is more if Forbes and Pat are on the floor too much during the starter minutes, Harden will hunt for them on mismatches.   If the mismatch happens then that puts the whole defense in a stress test and that’s how you start getting into real trouble and start conceding open 3s to Joe Harris"
Joe harris was on pace for 12 3s last game
I'm more comfortable with Middleton on joe Harris or KD if that give you an indication of his defensive strengths and weaknesses
"Pat will start, he's been really good this year. He'll be guarding Joe Harris. Then it's going to be Jrue on Kyrie, Khris on James, Giannis on Kevin and Brook on whoever is playing center."
Forbes will primarily chase Joe Harris around screens I’ll bet. This does likely move Middleton onto Harden or KD which could be interesting.
Joe Harris
&gt;	the Nets big 2  Joe Harris’ substantial balls
"Two former MVPs, 4 all-star caliber players outside that, Joe 'Sky Sloppy-Seconds' Harris. The thought is they will be exposed on their defense, but I am seeing a fully armed and operational battle station."
"Dame, maybe Joe Harris"
Joe Harris
Well if they could keep jimmy bam and harden he shoulda done it. BKN didnt give up KD or Kyrie or even joe harris
A duo of KD and Kawhi would be a nightmare for any team. Kyrie and Joe Harris would just make them even more unfair.
For real and you have the best spot up shooter joe Harris in the corner too. I just don’t see how you can beat that team.
"he can only guard 1 at a time, plus you got Joe Harris and Blake to worry about, leave any one of those 5 open and its about as sure a bucket as any."
I will not abide the disrespect to Joe Harris in here.
"The question is who is stopping KD &amp; Kyrie &amp; Harden when Joe ""Klay Thompson"" Harris is wide open in the corner?   Nets might have to win every game 140-130, but a win is a win."
Elite spot up shooters   No joe Harris...
3 superstars. you can't double anyone especially if joe harris is on the court as well
Who guards Joe Harris?  PJ Tucker?
It’s 100% true. I’m sure you can tell a guy like Caruso will rarely get those host bump calls that lebron or Davis get. Similarly joe Harris for us will drive and almost never get a foul
"Well, they're both pretty scary IMO.   It's scary to see KD get going and realize Joe Harris is open if you try to help on him because Harden and Kyrie are also on the floor.   You guys should not fuck around and sweep the first two series because whoever you meet in the ECF It'll be a major battle and you want Joel well rested."
Joe Harris/Schroeder?
Joe Harris duh
Tatum is battling and he’s getting a ton of attention as the main and really only lethal option out there. Nets are doing a great job in making anyone else beat them   The other side has 2 top 5 players. Those players get calls. Especially when the other side has to pick their poison on who to defend and then there’s Kyrie and Joe Harris waiting
"80% of an elite player's production is an average player, like 80% of joe harris 3p% is pretty much league average  80% of nerlens noel might not start in europe"
"Nope, Joe Harris is too classy"
"Yes they’ll lock down Joe Harris for sure. The others, however might be a problem"
Will the Lakers be able to shut down Joe Harris like they did with Duncan Robinson last year?
Do u really think Joe Harris the one on that team keeping Frank Vogel up at night?
No chance. Joe Harris is not only way better but they could shut down Duncan because the Heat didn't have that much offensive firepower!
Fyi - The guy you’re responding to said that Joe Harris is more valuable than steph bc he’s 80% of steph for 50% of the money. Don’t expect any rationality from that clown
There's not a lot of players in this league that teams wouldnt trade for Klay even if he had average defence. A healthy Klay for Duncan Robinson or Joe Harris. They are on first flight to San Francisco.
He’s arguably their second most important role player behind Joe Harris. He’s been great this year
"Cuz Joe Harris receives not even close to the amount of attention Klay does, he hasn't done jack shit in the playoffs, is not nearly as good contested or on the move, hasnt been doing it for as long, and just doesn't have the ""it"" factor Klay has. To put it into perspective, Klaus shooting ability almost alone made him a perennial All star in his prime, something Harris has and never will touch."
The disrespect to Joe Harris smh
"Nothing makes mine better. Set it at 10 3PA and 40% and tell me who even shows up. It's Steph thrice and Dame once. Set it at 5 3PA at 45% and see who shows up. Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris. No Steph. So tell me, are Kyle Korver, JJ Reddick and Joe Harris better than Steph. Or are you sure Dame is the 2nd best shooter of all time? You 2 criteria have no overlap, so we can't make meaningful observations from them. Lowering it to 5 3PA at 40 gives us all the guys and then you can draw conclusions from that. Also, why are we doing individual seasons and not career. Discard everyone's worst 2 or 3 years if you want but do career. Hypothetically, if a guy shot 50% from 3 on 10PA for 2 years and then went back to mediocrity shooting below 40. where would you rate him?"
"Thanks for the thoughtful response.      &gt;First of all, like others have said before, you are inconsistent with the metrics that you use. You look at best season for 3's, count the number of good seasons for FT%, and look at career avg for mid range.  I included best season for mid range shooting as well. The stats aren't that inconsistent if you're simply comparing their peak seasons. For me, it's similar to a Magic vs Stockton or to a lesser extent, Jordan vs Lebron situation. Stockton was an elite passer for a much longer time than Magic was in the NBA, but few would argue that Magic was a worse playmaker, because when he peaked, he peaked really high. Many still consider Jordan the GOAT, because they think he peaked higher, but if you're comparing career value, it isn't close anymore, Lebron has 15 MVP-level seasons, Jordan has 10-11.   Similarly, when you're comparing the peak 3 point shooting seasons of elite shooters, Klay's doesn't stand out, especially when you consider the various factors involved. He doesn't have the best efficiency, nor the greatest volume, nor the best combination of both. I readily accept that he's done it more times than any non-Curry player, but that would and should only support the assertion that he's the 2nd best 3 point shooter of all-time, assuming you think longevity is more important.      &gt;Second, you say that Klay doesn't get hotter than anyone in NBA history because for each one of his great performances, there is a comparable performance from someone else.... but no one else (other than Steph) has the amount of crazy shooting nights as Klay.  I could have phrased that better but what I meant was single-game records shouldn't be used to determine things like these. I personally believe he gets hotter than anyone in NBA history, I just don't think it matters in discussions like these.      &gt;Finally, if you're going to say that someone isn't the second best shooter ever, you should probably say who you think is, and list all of the players that you think are better shooters than Klay.  I think Nash is clearly better if you consider mid-range shots, free throws, role, shot difficulty, efficiency, and longevity. His most accurate season was also the season he attempted the most 3s; I think he's one of the players most likely to maintain or even improve his elite efficiency while increasing his attempts, especially if he plays in the modern era or off-ball. (Which would be a complete waste considering he's an on-ball savant). If we're not talking about careers, I think Dame has already peaked higher as well and will stay on this level.      &gt;I understand that Dame shoots more unassisted three's, but Dame has shot 40% from three once in his career, Klay has done it every year of his career. And it's not like Dame shoots a much higher volume. Dame makes 3.0 per game for his career, Klay makes 2.9. I understand that Dame takes many more unassisted attempts, but the disparity in accuracy on similar volume between the two is just too great.  You're comparing career averages, which I don't think is representative of Dame's ability to shoot at this point in his career. If you're comparing their respective best seasons, I think Dame's is clearly more impressive. 10 times more unassisted 3s, even deeper range, slightly worse efficiency.     &gt;As for the other guys you named, they all play a very similar catch-and-shoot role to Klay. Korver shoots 1% better for his career from three but Klay makes nearly 50% more threes per game (2.9 vs 2.0). This same argument can be used for Joe Harris. JJ and Ray make far fewer threes per game and shoot a lower percentage than Klay. And Duncan Robinson just hasn't been in the league long enough for me to consider him.  A lot of this is just career vs peak, which I have addressed.     &gt;As for including mid-range and FT%, this is where things get tricky. I'll give you that when including these things you can easily make an argument that KD or Nash are the second best shooter ever. But all being said, Klay Thompson is absolutely the 2nd greatest 3-point shooter of all time.  I wouldn't have written this post if that's all I heard."
Joe harris is mixed
"You're right, need to throw in Joe Harris to make it equal"
"What if we set it to 5 3PA attempts at 40%. How many times does Klay make it and how many times everyone else? Let me check Klay makes it 7 times. At 10 3PA and 40% you get 3 seasons of Steph and one season of Dame. That one season was when Klay was MIA. If we set it at 45%3 at 5 3PA. JJ reddick makes it twice. Kyle Korver makes it thrice. Joe Harris twice. and Steph once. I will make it even easier. Based on your data is Dame the 2nd best 3 Point shooter in the league? Or is it Reddick, Joe Harris, or Kyle Korver 2nd. Actually, based on your 2nd criteria is Kyle Korver a better 3 pt shooter than steph because he had 3 seasons of 45% at 5+3PA compared to 1 for Steph. Don't just vomit words. Give us names"
"Yes. You're soooo close to getting it.  &gt;If Joe Harris took a couple extra 3PA per game and made 40% of those extra shots, ***he'd be a better shooter***."
"If Joe Harris took a couple extra 3PA per game and made 40% of those shots. He would be taking them right now. He is taking the maximum number of 3PA he can with current efficiency. Nets would be stupid not to give him more attempts if he could maintain the efficiency. But I don't think he can. Also, all his attempts are wide open. Klay on the other hand would shoot over anyone and their mother."
Klay is the best catch and shoot 3pt shooter in the league IMO. He hasn’t played in 2 years though so it’s hard to compare him to people who have been the best recently like Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson.
"Similarly, if Klay took less shots and shot more efficiently, that’s Joe Harris"
"If Joe Harris took a couple extra 3PA per game and made 40% of those extra shots, he'd be a better shooter.  That's Klay Thompson."
Not so surprising when you realize he thinks Joe Harris has the same offensive impact as Klay lmao
"Imo, it's extremely hard to measure the goat shooter due to the various types of shots that guys have to shoot. E.g., joe harris (amazing shooter) gets mostly open looks while klay's are usually with a hard close out. It's so tough to judge.   I think we've all recognized that steph's the goat. But why? You could probably find many metrics that rebut that proposition. However, the degree of difficulty and his accuracy in this degree have us all amazed and ready to bow to him.   So, I'm not convinced that klay is better than harris or harris is better than klay. Conversely insert any other 2 names in there. Reggie and redick or bird and klay. I just don't know.    I can say this with some confidence:  there aren't many on the lists that you provided that could do what klay did in g6 in OKC, down 10. That was nuts. Mad props to him. And I'd rather us all enjoy klay's brilliance than argue over where he belongs in some list. That goes for lebron v. Mj or anyone else.   Except for those who think dramont is a top 10 player. I'll argue with anyone til eternity on that. ;)"
"At the same time, you can argue that Joe Harris’s percentage the last few years is not comparable. He had two seasons leading the league at 47.4 and 47.5% where Klay had never finished higher than 5th at 44%. That 3.5% difference is huuuuuge. It’s what separates a 40% shooter and a 36.5% shooter  As for volume, during Joe’s peak season (this year) he averaged 3.1 3 point makes a game whereas Klay’s peak averaged 3.5. Thats a .4 difference in volume of 3 point shots in. Yes, Klay has had a higher volume, but Harris still has had better efficiency even factoring his first 3 seasons."
"Klay Thompson is the best 3 and D ever.  On my opinion, but arguable, 2nd best shooter in the league tied with Joe Harris.  Klay is the only player besides Steph and Dame, that I would believe can break Kobe's record"
"&gt; Joe Harris also shot 40 from 3 in 4 consecutive seasons on high volume  Harris was 20th in the league in 3PA this year, which is the first year he's been in the top 20.  Klay was top 5 in the league for 5 consecutive years and top 12 two other years.  The volume is not at all comparable."
"I’m baffled people think this is good content, OP’s argument is full of holes. When people praise Klay’s shooting, it is almost always in the context of 3PT shooting (like Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson). No one’s under the impression that he’s a midrange assassin or something.   He also compares single season peak instead of career averages for 3PT volume and efficiency, which is the main reason people think Klay’s the 2nd best shooter in the league. Dame, Lavine, or Duncan Robinson haven’t had the consistency that Klay has over the years, and there’s no reason people should value peak over longevity.   He also arbitrary decides that players should be penalized for having higher assist %, even though this is a post about shooting and not creating your own shot."
Klay has shot 40% from 3 in 7 consecutive seasons. The lowest of which is 4.1 attempts in his rookie season in only 24 mpg. He has shot above 40% from 3 in 6 consecutive seasons at minimum 6 3pa. Highest Joe Harris got was this year at 6.4.
"Joe Harris also shot 40 from 3 in 4 consecutive seasons on high volume, and led the league twice in 3 point percentage, which Klay has never done. Harris also has a higher career 3 point shooting percentage."
"I don't understand why this post is getting so much love.  First of all, like others have said before, you are inconsistent with the metrics that you use. You look at best season for 3's, count the number of good seasons for FT%, and look at career avg for mid range. The only reason that someone would really do this is to cherry-pick stats to fit their argument.  Second, you say that Klay doesn't get hotter than anyone in NBA history because for each one of his great performances, there is a comparable performance from someone else. The thing that you forgot to say is that Klay's name is the only one that keeps showing up when you list the crazy shooting games. No one other than Curry comes close to having as many insane shooting performances as Klay. Like you said, he scored 37 in a quarter on 13/13 shooting, 60 in 29 mins, most threes in a playoff game (11), and you forgot he also holds the record for threes in a regular season game (14). All of T-Mac, Reggie, Kobe, Gilbert, and more have performances that can compare to one or two of these, but no one else (other than Steph) has the amount of crazy shooting nights as Klay.  Finally, if you're going to say that someone isn't the second best shooter ever, you should probably say who you think is, and list all of the players that you think are better shooters than Klay.  In each of your 8 main points, you say who would be better than Klay if that argument is the only thing you consider, while throwing around a bunch of different names. It seems like the main people you're considering are Dame, Korver, Ray Allen, JJ Redick, Duncan Robinson, and Joe Harris.  I understand that Dame shoots more unassisted three's, but Dame has shot 40% from three once in his career, Klay has done it every year of his career. And it's not like Dame shoots a much higher volume. Dame makes 3.0 per game for his career, Klay makes 2.9. I understand that Dame takes many more unassisted attempts, but the disparity in accuracy on similar volume between the two is just too great.  As for the other guys you named, they all play a very similar catch-and-shoot role to Klay. Korver shoots 1% better for his career from three but Klay makes nearly 50% more threes per game (2.9 vs 2.0). This same argument can be used for Joe Harris. JJ and Ray make far fewer threes per game and shoot a lower percentage than Klay. And Duncan Robinson just hasn't been in the league long enough for me to consider him.  As for including mid-range and FT%, this is where things get tricky. I'll give you that when including these things you can easily make an argument that KD or Nash are the second best shooter ever. But all being said, Klay Thompson is absolutely the 2nd greatest 3-point shooter of all time."
"I also wonder why op wouldn’t take about the rise in maximizing 3 point shooting since Klay has been out and how that has impacted shooters like dame and joe harris (also harris now teamed w three guys that almost surely will draw consistent doubles allowing him to shoot wide open 3’s). Seeing Curry’s increase in 3’s and MVP esque season, its possible Klay shoots better than he ever would have this year."
Ok lol I guess Joe Harris is a second option then. Sorry you’re right
What a steal. One thing I like about Joe Harris is that he can drive the ball well on top of being a great 3 point shooter
"Joe Harris is more than a shooter, he is an elite finisher, and can drive/pass as well. Not to mention he led the league in 3 pt % in 2018 before he played with stars. You're underselling him"
"This is maybe the best content I have seen on this sub in years and people are posting shit comments because they don't like the point your making.  Thank you for doing this, the biggest question tho is how much the assisted% matters when it comes to defining how good a shooter is. This made me realize that we need to break out ""shooter"" into two categories with distinct criteria. The first is how good a shooter is at doing exactly and only that, shooting the ball into the hoop, regardless of shot difficulty. The second needs to revolve around a players ability to shoot from as many different situations as possible.   Joe Harris is probably a better ""pure"" shooter than Dame, but Dam is a million times better at shooting while in difficult situations."
"bUt It'S tHe CeLtIcS  The Nets have a huge game and now all of a sudden they are playing a bottom 3 team so it's not at all impressive.   It's still the playoffs and Stevens is still a top 5 coach. The Nets looked like they were playing pickup against a college team, they were able to do anything they wanted on offense, including getting Joe Harris, the league leading 3p%, get multiple completely wide open looks from 3.   26 made field goals on 19 assists with 3 turnovers."
"If he wanted to go to the Lakers, they would find a way. It ain't that hard - it would be hard to fill out the roster after that, but Lakers have enough good salary to do a sign and trade for Kawhi, even without draft capital.  They would likely be what the Nets are right now, just better if LeBron stays LeBron. Caruso could be the Joe Harris of the West, just... better WHITE MAMBA 4EVA!"
"Tbh I never really questioned Klay being the second best shooter in the league, but you’re right. Klay gets some of his aura from the Warriors and Curry. People still think of Golden State when they think of 3’s even though Houston far surpassed them in attempts during the Harden years because the Warriors represented a shift in the way the game was played and they dominated doing it. Klay was a key part of that history so it’s just perpetuated as common  knowledge that he’s second best in the league.   Tho I’d say his game 6 against the Thunder, 37 point quarter, and 43 point game with like 4 dribbles are also a huge reason he’s seen that way; though he plays similarly to Joe Harris or Duncan Robinson, he’s hit way higher peaks during single games than them even if their season or career peaks are similar. For example, Klay’s career high in points is 60, whereas Joe Harris’ is 30. So to me it’s unquestioned that he’s the best at his play style, but when it comes to comparing different play styles, he is surpassed by other players like Dame."
saving this and i strongly agree. I really dont know how someone can think klay is better than Dame and Kyrie  considering free throws and assisted percentage. And Joe Harris is also a better shooter but people wouldnt be ready for that
I think Joe Harris is a way better shooter than Dame. You don’t get bonus points for missing hard shots.
Simmons on KD; Thybulle on Kyrie; Embiid in the paint for the win??  edit whos got joe harris?
"Yea with a good scouting department and being able to identify talent and hidden gems like Joe Harris, who knows what could happen. Obviously nets would have liked Tatum and Brown but through taking on salary dumps for late firsts and trading away any players that had value to contending teams they got Jarrett Allen, Caris levert, and D'lo and built a winning culture that players wanted to join in free agency."
Joe Harris is basically Klay Thompson lite
"Joe Harris isn’t comparable to Duncan Robinson. Both are elite shooters but Joe Harris is also a good defender, rebounder, can finish at the rim, etc."
"Only reason I didn't mention that series is Boston is playing with injuries, had they been healthy this might not have been a sweep. Let's be real that nets team is beyond broken. You want to double Harden? Cool you got Kyrie or KD open, and if you some how manage to get and defend them you need to hope blake griffen doesn't posterize you in the paint or get torched by former 3 point champ joe harris."
"Nah, if you’re literally only good at one thing, even if you’re elite at that thing, you don’t deserve $20 million. It may be okay on a team with a bunch of stars that can mask the player’s weaknesses, like Joe Harris on the Nets, but it’ll bite most teams in the ass if they waste cap space like that."
"Joe Harris, for one"
But joe Harris is fucking fire rn
Joe Harris or Robinson&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kennard. Harris is also soooo much more than just shooting catch and shoot corner 3s lol
That’s a weird way to spell Joe Harris
"Joe Harris scores more than bertans, but I understand your point."
Joe Harris is better than Bertans at literally every aspect of basketball
"Are you kidding me?  This Nets team is basically the 2017 Cavs (which had the best offense of all time, even better than the 2017 Warriors) but replace Love with fucking James Harden and 40 year old Korver with fucking Joe Harris, the BEST THREE POINT SHOOTER IN THE LEAGUE AS THEIR FOURTH OPTION.  I would say Kyrie is a much better player overall now as well, but I don't truly know if that's accurate.  KD seems to be completely fine.  Their offense is completely absurd.  Their defense may not be 2017 Warrior levels, but the Warriors fell off defensively after 17 too."
That's not going to save them from Joe Harris
The point is the league shot 38% on open 3s. Mavs are shooting 70%. Even Steph curry doesn’t shoot 70% on open 3s. Joe Harris the leagues best spot up shooter only shoots a bit over 50% on open 3s
"If you really want count the 4th star then put Joe harris there, idt blake is any better than 7th man of that team (once spencer is back)"
"Last second shot, fate of the world on the line. I want JOE HARRIS"
What if Joe Harris snakes (sorry KD) it away
What role players? Their other two starters are fucking Joe Harris and Blake Griffin. Does anyone look out of rhythm when you watch them play? They get both those guys consistent buckets. James Harden is a near-Klay level shooter and is just significantly better at everything else on offense. Just having them in the same conversation is insulting to Harden.
"I honestly think 5% is pretty accurate. Beating KD, Harden, Kyrie and Joe Harris in a best of seven just seems impossible, I’d probably take them over the 73-9 warriors tbh"
This isn’t even a discussion lol. OPs points boil down to “Joe Harris and Jeff Green at better 3 point shooters than Andre and Draymond so the nets offense is better”
Don't talk down to me about Joe Harris and Dinwiddie like I'm some casual.  Those trades don't happen unless you already have KD and Kyrie and you know that. It's ok. Most teams would do the same thing too if they had the opportunity.  My point is your boy I replied to needs to take a chill pill  Take care.
"Caris and Jarrett Allen were used as TRADE pieces for James Harden, that's not bought. Again, a TRADE. That's where players are traded to another team for another player. They aren't bought from another team.  Also, Joe Harris, you may know him from last night's game, was picked up out of the garbage bin. Spencer Dinwiddie is injured, but he was as well."
"So? Do you know what a Superteam is? So KD/Kyrie and.... Joe harris is on the level of the Heatles, KDWarriors, Celtics? Just admit it without Harden Nets are not a Superteam, a really good team but not a Superteam"
"""We should let the most lethal 7 foot jump shooter of all time get buckets and keep not defending the 3. They only have Joe Harris. What could go wrong?"" Bud"
Yea we still gave a ton of open looks to Miami. We’re daring Joe Harris and KD to shoot wide open jumpers like what do we expect?
Joe Harris has the lowest 3 point % for the nets this game
"Not to mention, what happened to thei defense? They weren’t a great 3pt defense to begin with, but they’re really just giving up open 3s to Joe Harris now."
"Yea, the Bucks are really shitty on offense right now, but their defensive rotations are just as shitty.   And not just in a ""KD and Kyrie are unguardable"" way. In a ""holy fuck 3 dudes all closed out on one person so now Joe Harris is open in the corner"" way."
lol they have KD and Kyrie Joe Harris who won the three point contest and Blake Griffin. Joe Harris starts on multiple teams theyre stacked.
Joe Harris is everywhere holy shit
"Joe Harris is sneaky good off the dribble.  As a contrast, a guy like Klay is someone you basically never want putting the ball on the floor because his decision making is average at best as are his ballhandling skills.  Harris can catch the ball behind the arc and dribble two or three times and make a good play."
"It's an honest question from my part, I don't understand why Bud have him guard Joe Harris"
KD Kyrie and Joe Harris would beat any team in the league + harden is the best team ever
"KD, Kyrie and Joe Harris is the greatest team of all time? Lmfao"
Joe Harris really causes so much chaos off the ball
Lumpinee Champion Joe Harris with the Elbow
Leave Joe Harris wide open... oh fuck wait...
"Is it just me, or does Joe Harris looks like Daniel Radcliffe? (Harry Potter) lol"
Lopez is getting abused. The Bucks should just blitz with his length and force other guys to beat them as long as it isnt Joe Harris. He's not doing anything in drop coverage. Not taking away the roller or the shot.
"We see the Nets offense run a simple Horns set to get Joe Harris the ball, who attacks the paint forcing the defense to collapse and then give it to Kyrie who decoys kicking out back to Harris for a easy 3"
Joe Harris is such a Snipe Show
Joe Harris is amazing
Lmfao Joe Harris the middle linebacker apparently
joe harris has the strongest butt in the east
Joe Harris is a badass lol
"Nash is underrated. His coaching is easily shadowed by the Big 3s, but people usually forgot they had rarely played together this season.   What really surprised me is how Nash leveraged his role players, especially the white shooters like M James, Joe Harris, Shamet. You rarely see so many white players on the court simultaneously."
joe harris an absolute tank moving tucker like that
And with his 2nd shot of the quarter Joe Harris has tied 2 time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo's 1st half point total
is it even a superteam if they're down Harden?  If anything it just makes Kyrie and KD look that much better.  Joe harris too
Joe Harris catch and shoot is unreal
Joe Harris is an incredible third option let alone fourth when Harden is playing.
Why is Blake even bothering crashing the offensive glass on a wide open Joe Harris 3
"Kyrie, KD, and Joe Harris seriously all have such beautiful shooting form. I’m always more surprised at their misses than makes"
I can't believe they gave KD/Kyrie/Harden a Joe Harris
They keep leaving Joe Fucking Harris open lol
"I'd rather have Giannis than almost anyone in the NBA, however it's funny to me that Joe Harris is outshining in this very specific game."
hes a more expensive joe harris.... that doesnt shoot as well.
lol k.  I mean maybe this game but you'd rather have joe harris than Jrue?
Nets lucky to have Joe Harris
Joe Harris wide open is green every time.
joe harris  &gt; giannis 😤
I genuinely think I would prefer having Joe Harris on my team than anyone on the bucks.
Joe Harris hasn't gone off yet (7 pts)
"The Nets are like the Mavs, if KP was replaced with Kyrie and THJ was replaced by Harden. Maxi Kleber with Joe Harris. And then literally every other player was upgraded  Clippers can't beat them"
"If the Nets win a ring this year, will that be the title won with the least overall amount of time on a team's roster ever?  The only main contributor to the team who joined prior to 2 years ago will have been Joe Harris. He's a nice player, but he's never been any better than the 3rd leading scorer for the Nets. At least the Heatles had Wade and the Raptors had Lowry.  Can we start calling them the Brooklyn Mercenaries yet?"
"People talk about the Nets like they have an abysmal defense, it's just not true. Yeah, Bam is a much better defender than Blake, but the Nets as a whole play solid team defense and when they get out running it is really hard to keep up with them, which in turn makes their defense even stronger.   Kyrie is a negative defender, and Harden is at times at well, but KD is excellent on D, as are Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, and Nic Claxton. The Nets are ***NOT*** the ""Twice the offense, half the defense"" team that a lot of the media and casual fans have built them up to be."
Nets would be worse with Harden playing. Joe Harris and Bruce Brown are much better fits.
you could probably give the bucks joe harris for free and the nets would still crush them  by a million points
Zoning a team with KD Kyrie and Joe Harris is certainly a decision
Middleton getting out played by joe Harris and Mike James
"our gm is very very good. Obviously the stars joining us helps but his ability to find diamonds in the rough is crazy. Levert,allen were late rounders. Joe harris signed of the PS. Mike james getting signed from europe. Bruce brown.   Yep. We good"
i wouldn’t be surprised at this point. I don’t even know how they’re able to pay 3 max contracts AND Joe Harris as it is
you forgot Joe Harris
They have joe Harris guarding brook and he wants to just sit at the 3pt line
the next 5 years belong to Joe Harris
They are guarding Brook Lopez with Joe Harris.  Maybe put more spacing around him so he can go to work.
"Haven't watched a lot of Nets game in reg season, but it seems that Joe Harris is not just some 3 &amp; D guy huh?"
"Leaving both Kyrie and Joe Harris wide open on the perimeter so they can put 3 bodies in the paint to stop ""?""  It's unreal how unprepared he is."
JOE HARRIS SLICING AND DICING
Genuinely wtf do you even do against this team? We were all hoping they’d have some trash ass defence but even that’s not looking like a weakness Rn... and when you have Joe Harris as your FOURTH option when everyone’s fit... wtf
Why is Giannis covering Joe Harris? Isn’t he the DPOY? Why is Jrue Holliday covering KD? Dude I hate the bucks rn lol
Joe Harris as the 4th man is unfair lol
i love having to double durant just to leave joe harris free in the corner
crowd started cheering before Joe Harris even shot it
Still leaving Joe Harris open.
Someone wanna explain to me how Joe Harris is boxing out two Bucks players?
"KD is the best player in the world rn and Kyrie is top 15 with gody handles. Blake is washed, but solid and guys like Joe Harris are pretty good too. Harden is just overkill"
HAHA WIDE OPEN JOE HARRIS... the last thing you see before you die.
This defense is allowing Joe Harris to attack lmao
Joe Harris is more effective at driving to the basket than Porzingis
Joe Harris the acrobat
"Maybe the real Big 3 was Bruce Brown, Joe Harris and Blake"
Nets just playing so much harder with so much more want and intensity. Joe Harris boxed our giannis and Middleton on that put back and box out I mean stand there
This game will go down as the Joe Harris game. Nets by 6
I hope Playoff Bud shows up again tonight with great scheme decisions like rotating off of Joe Harris to prevent Blake Griffin threes
Because you generally have to be more than a role player to earn a max. Nobody is gonna max Joe Harris for example.
Uhh okay? I was talking about Joe Harris
Joe Harris isn’t
Joe Harris just that good!
"You would be surprised. I ran the numbers for the 4 best spot up shooters I could think of Seth Curry, Joe Harris, Marcus Morris and Bryn Forbes and none of them shoot better than 2.37 percent better at home than away."
"You’re absolutely right. Still, you would think that after the third or fourth 3 Marcus knocked down they would have a body on him off the ball and not bring his man for doubles/traps kind of like how teams do for Joe Harris."
Joe Harris.
Every 15 minutes someone new discovers how good Joe Harris is.
"what adjustment can you make on kevin durant, they were triple teaming him at points and he still scored  middleton needs to play 500% better defense, he gets lost so easily.  jrue can't guard 4 guys on the perimeter at the same time because KD is collapsing your defense inside  guys have to do a better job fighting through screens because joe harris scorched them off a single high screen over and over, or they simply lost him trying to keep track of KD and kyrie"
I think it was either KD or Joe Harris if my astrology is right.
I think Joe Harris is the perfect hiding spot for one Trae Young. Not like we'd really want him on Irving either. We may have to shake things up if we beat Philly.
"Ah true, although I don't love the idea of putting Collins on Joe Harris either"
"&gt;Luka is 100% surrounded by shooters man.  No, he's not. Inconsistent players who make 60% of their attempts one day and 25% another aren't shooters. Bogdan, Bojan, Ingles, Gallo, Joe Harris, Bertans. Seth- these guys are shooters.  &gt;They were 3rd in percentage and 5th in attempts for the playoffs coming into tonight  Horrible sample size. They were 18th in percentage in the 72 game regular season."
"Also to answer your question though, you guys need to stop doubling on Durant. He's too good of a playmaker and we have too many lethal shooters on our team. Shammet can get hot.. Joe Harris is the best catching shoot three-point shooter in the league, KD and Kyrie also shoot over 40 percent from 3. Also I think Uncle Jeff shot around 40% from 3 and he's due back game three. Blake Griffin has even been knocking them down."
"Harris is shooting 52% from 3 in the playoffs, leaving him open is not a good plan. If I was our opponents I’d rather have Kyrie or KD taking open threes than Joe Harris taking open threes."
"Hardest to predict 😂 If harden plays Nets in 5  If harden doesn’t play Nets in 6  Clippers have a bad track record of handling individual brilliance from ball handlers/scorers  (Luka, Murray)  Luka is cold but he should NOT have been able to take them to 7   And kawhi and pg have apparently lost all their defensive ability or desire so there goes the idea that they’d make KD work. Kyrie and KD would go off and Joe Harris would kill them from 3. And what do you know Blake Griffin can actually play. Smh Hate this team so much, but yea Nets in 6 if no Harden"
"You’d have to really dilute the term to do so. Joe Harris is an absolute boss, but he’s not the third guy in a superteam."
"Those weren't open shots you guys were missing so that's not really helpful.  And vice versa - The Nets didn't have some 3 pointer explosion. They shot as they normally do and if anything, to have Joe Harris shoot *only* 4/9 when he was WIDE OPEN for practically all of them is the abnormal part."
Joe fucking Harris is my fav gay porn
Lebron would’ve probably settled for Joe fucking Harris a few nights ago
"only comparable one I can think of is Nets Kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, KD, Jeff Green lineup"
Klay is basically a better Joe Harris.
Wish we had some more dudes to hit shots. What do we need to do to get Joe Harris mid playoffs.
Im expecting Joe Harris level player
"Hes gonna be a liability on defense, this guy was always running around the court switching. Im expecting a slight better version of Joe Harris (Still pretty good)"
Dinwiddie had a major injury. Jordan is not a positive asset. Joe Harris was ineligible to trade. Rockets got the best offer possible from the Nets (barring a Kyrie trade). The moves they made after (Allen + Oladipo trades) were bad though.
"&gt;Your argument is like saying Joe Harris is a top 10 player because he has nice stats lol  If you don't understand the point of absurd comparisons, I agree, I'm not sure there's much point in you responding.  I guess they don't have English class in New York or something.  It's sad... you can't even have a basic conversation without getting confused."
"It's been a while since I've seen such a carry job like what KD is doing right now.  He's even setting back screens to Joe ""Can't hit the wide side of a barn"" Harris so he can get a free layup. Just the whole package."
Do you see how Joe Harris and James Harden is playing? Im guessing you aren’t watching this game
Joe Harris
"Unlike Joe Harris, Bruce Brown isn't scared of the big stage."
Finally took Joe Harris out thank god
Joe Harris owes the mafia some money
"KD CARRYING the fuck outta the Nets + Jeff Green. Everyone else been two packs of ass, especially Joe Harris."
"Bruh, if Joe Harris hit two more threes we would be up😭😭😭"
Who the hell is saying Joe Harris is a star/big 4??
Joe Harris went from Klay Thompson to Grayson Allen real quick when he was asked to be the 3rd option
after that shot by shamet i don't want to see another joe harris minute
Joe Harris has only made 1 more 3 than me tonight.
If it comes down to last possession needing one shot to win. I hope Joe Harris shoots it lmao
Series would be over if joe Harris didn’t suck ass
Joe Harris needs some tips from Joe Fatone because he's not iN Sync...  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I will leave now.
"I'm not willing to EVER hear how Joe Harris is the Nets 4th star, they being Big-4, etc.  He looks good for one reason, and one reason alone - zero pressure and shooting wide wide open threes. He's not bad, he's a role player, and that's the kind of games / series role players have.   Just like you can get a Danny Green amazing series then 2 series of shit, this is no different."
Joe harris having the worst strech of his career tho
Kind of but hes been passive too. Hes got 14 shots. Joe Harris has 11. Giannis and Middleton both have taken more shots than KD.
"This just shows you that Joe Harris is no Curry, Thompson, or Ray Allen.   Playoffs 3PT shooting vs Regular season"
Joe Harris has been so fucking bad this series
Sub Nash in for Joe Harris
KD gonna make a name for himself if he can win with Joe Harris and a one legged Harden.
"Joe Harris and Jeff Green are a combined 6-13 from three. The Nets will take that any day, so I don't see why everyone is so down on Joe."
Joe Harris isn't he used to the spotlight. He's choking when it matters the most
joe harris shot 47.5% from 3 in the regular season lmao
Hasn’t Giannis made more threes than Joe Harris rn? Lmao dude is horrible
Joe harris is useless and Harden can’t even run. So the bucks are in danger of losing a 3.5 v 5.
What happend to Joe Harris? I don't understand this.
Joe Harris last 3 fg %   2-11 (today)   3-8   1-11
Joe Harris sucks.
Joe Harris been dooo dooo lately
Joe Harris grade A garbage
Joe Harris smh get your head out of your arse!
Joe Harris legitimately worse than Harden tonight
What in the fucking fuck is wrong with Joe Harris? He's a non NBA talent out there right now.
Never forget Joe Harris once won the 3 point shootout
Joe Harris is broke as fuck tonight. KD playing with Jeff green as his second option and nets would be up rn if Harris could shoot lmao
Joe harris is prob the weakest mental toughness in league. Dude is shook
You can tell Joe Harris is playing scared. first time he is in the spotlight
Joe Harris gonna get traded to the Italian league mid game
Joe Harris got his stuff packed for Cancun
joe harris is actually throwing
Damn joe harris is dookie water
Joe Harris is a bonafide scrub
"Joe Harris is in his head. Dude, you shot 47%, YOUR THINKING TO MUCH."
send joe harris to teh fuckin gulag
What's up with Joe Harris lately? He went from a straight bucket to straight ass.
Joe harris 😭😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
I think Joe Harris needs a hair cut dude can’t see
Joe Harris is a worse player than Kyle kuzma.  I’m completely fucking serious.
"C'mon Joe Harris, if KD wanted to play with Randy Foye, he would've just stayed in OKC"
Joe Harris needs to be benched yesterday.
An airball is not the shot you wanna end the quarter with in a tight game. Joe Harris is in his own head now lol
Tf happened to Joe Harris
"I dont care if the Bucks win this series, Coach Bud needs to get fired. Dude has harden on 1 leg and Joe Harris being a 6'6 kyle kuzma and you're only up single digits"
Really hope joe Harris isn’t on the Olympic team
Joe Harris is ASS
JOE HARRIS IS A FUCKING BUM
Joe Harris you aint Middleton lmao.
Did the Monstars visit Joe Harris and steal his ability?
Joe Harris plz
Joe Harris sleeper agent confirmed
What the actual fuck happened to Joe Harris
"why are you smiling joe harris, you got nothing to be happy about"
Bruh what happened to Joe Harris lol
Joe Harris is so bad right now
Still can’t believe KD compared Joe Harris to Klay Thompson.
Lmao  Joe “best shooter in the league” Harris
"Joe Harris: ""I USUALLY MAKE THOSE! WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME TODAY!?"""
Joe Harris is so bad.
Joe Harris and missed 3s this series. Memorable.
joe harris wtf
Joe Harris smiling at himself
Duncan Robinson &gt; Joe Harris
"Joe Harris gotta retire on the stool, man lmao"
THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN JOE HARRIS
Joe Harris can redeem himself in this next 12 minutes...
Joe Harris went from looking like an all time shooter to a fucking scrub 😭😭😭
Joe Harris wants to go to Cancun huh?
Joe Harris looks lost
Joe Harris. That’s the comment.
How much did the Nets pay for Joe Harris?
Joe Harris playing like he has money on the Bucks
Joe harris sucks
Wow joe harris has been a whole ass
joe harris is DOGSHIT
Joe Harris is arguably the best bucks player
Joe harris seeing three rims today lmao
Joe harris hahahahahah
Joe Harris GOATED
the collapse of Joe Harris has been interesting
Joe Harris wants to lose its official.
Joe Harris is playing that bad they aren’t even attempting to block his shots.
Joe Harris has been god awful
Do you guys remember when joe Harris used to be good?
Wtf happened to Joe Harris?
Is Joe Harris…overpaid?
Joe Harris has been GARBAGE
BRO JOE HARRIS YOU CANT BE FUCKING SERIOUS
Lmao Joe Harris what happened to you
You could’ve been joe Harris
And Joe Harris was a bum shooting this whole series. Kd was gonna get his points but chances were Harris would miss
"All I see here is Joe Harris was the best 3 point shooter in the league this year, but Giannis&gt;Joe Harris so Giannis is the best 3 point shooter in the league this year. That’s math r/NBA, enough of the Giannis slander."
Joe Harris better
I would unironically want Joe Harris on the Bucks lol
"He never gives up. When you’re shooting cold you can go the way of Joe Harris or the way of Khris Middleton and have faith. Idk if Khris missed 10 shots in a row, he should keep shooting. Also Khris in elimination games is usually incredible. Khris slander should be banned"
"He put on a great show and did all he could. Most points ever scored in a game 7. Hit a clutch shot that sent it to OT. Just couldn’t bring it home with Harden at 50% and Kyrie sidelined. Not to mention Joe Harris turning invisible. If you want to hate on him for that, go ahead. Don’t drag us into it, though."
"If joe harris is a star, i am kobe"
"“Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are the best shooters I’ve played with,” Durant said. “Joe Harris is definitely right up there, getting there.”"
"Yeah. Joe Harris is exactly the kind of player who you expect to look better in the context of a flowing offense full of players who all understand each other's games.   And the ball tends to stick with Durant. And, I mean, of course it does, given how good he is, so you don't even mind. But compared to how the team looked with Kyrie and/or Harden, it wasn't the sort of thing where a player like Harris is going to be able to get into a flow.   Does that impact his layups? I don't know. But it definitely could put him out of sorts."
"He choked but I don’t even want to pile on him. The annoying/sad thing is he ruined KD’s best chance at joining Top 10. If Nets win back to back or even get 3, I think KD moves arguably to Top 10 or 12 all-time. For every Ray Allen/Ron Artest to build you up, there’s a Joe Harris to brick you down."
The Joe Harris whisperer
"This is why you never overpay strictly 3pt shooters that can do nothing else, Joe Harris and Bertans are prime examples.  Dont OVERPAY Robinson MIAMI"
"You know both can be correct right? Bud absolutely deserved to be clowned for his minutes management for Giannis. Last year Giannis was averaging like 34 minutes in the playoffs and still busted his ankle and they lost in the 2nd round, so what did minutes management do then? The Bucks were lucky to have Harden and Kyrie get injured during their series and barely won the series, and a major part of them winning the series was Bud not limiting Giannis to 34 minutes a game again. They got destroyed the first 2 games with Giannis playing 35/31 minutes and then proceeded to play him 43/38/42/41 and 50 minutes in this final game. Had Bud been stubborn again and limited Giannis, the Bucks would have lost and probably not even been in this game 7.  Just because it they squeaked out a victory, literally a single shot away from losing, doesn't mean all the past decisions were correct all of a sudden lol. On the other hand, Nash had no issues playing KD minutes, and we saw that they almost beat a healthy Bucks team with a 1 legged Harden and KD. Had Joe Harris made literally any shot in this series, especially that wide open one towards the end, you wouldn't be saying these things lmao."
At least Duncan usually has one flamethrower game in a series to go with a lot of cold games. Joe Harris was just average the 1st 2 home games then became complete awful the next 5
Joe Harris
"It's cherry picked yes but it gets the point across. Joe Harris was garbage that series and couldn't perform the only skill he has. If Joe Harris couldn't shoot 3s, he wouldn't be an NBA player.....he would probably be an auditor or selling used cars"
"Besides Kyrie getting injured, Joe Harris is pretty much the reason the Nets lost this series"
Lebron would create open looks after open looks after open looks for everybody. Joe Harris would need to forget what is a basketball for him not to have 20 points in this game. Lebron is not the type of player which you can counter by protecting the paint or just one thing he does. If he cant drive he will shoot fadeaways. KD is nowhere near as scary as Lebron.
"Why is nobody talking about the fact that Blake Griffen is suddenly an elite shooter in this series? Seriously, he is what I thought Joe Harris would've been  EDIT: he shot 14-34. Felt like he shot waaay better than that... Probably due to 3 games where he slot like 50% from the 3 and made 10 3 pointers."
Seth Curry became a free agent at the wrong time.  Curry signed a 4 year $32 million contract in 2019.  Joe Harris 4 year $75 million in 2020  Davis Bertain 5 years $80 million in 2020  Imagine what Curry could have gotten if he became a free agent in 2020 or 2021.
"Imagine if that happened. Like Giannis and KD and everyone are busy shaking hands, and on the other side of the court someone inbounds it to Joe Harris who hits a wide open 3 to win it lmao"
"Klay can hit an open 3 in the playoffs too, unlike Joe Harris in the last 5 games"
Only a braindead nephew thinks KD is passing any torch. When the Nets are healthy next year and have traded Joe Harris they’ll be near unstoppable I bet.
"Hey you'll get no argument from me. I'm just pointing out what could have been.  Put all 3 players on the court and someone find Joe Harris two decent wrists and it's a sweep, or 5 games at worst.   Bucks won. Giannis was a beast.  I like how all these lame bums forget the fact that Middleton and Holiday almost cost them the game for 3/4 of the game. But Bucks fans gloss over that.  Well, the front runners do. Real Bucks fans will point out that fact."
Joe “Davis Bertans” Harris
"If you think Joe Harris this series was comparable to Middleton at all, I don’t think you watched."
"Obviously, but the officiating double standards are making them less and less viable. The league is making conscious, targeted efforts to discourage the playstyles that favor big guys.   Offensive/defensive 3-second violations, the restricted area, freedom of movement, traveling/carrying never called anymore; these are all rules or philosophies that are designed to promote perimeter-oriented play at the expense of inside players.  Like, look at Embiid or Jokic trying to establish post position; they're blatantly held, pushed and shoved every single time.  But if Joe fucking Harris wants to curl around an off-ball screen and you do any of the above, then it's an auto-call when the refs see it."
"Your roster wasn't paper thin though? Blake Griffin was great for you guys, Jeff Green was solid and had that huge game, Bruce Brown was solid, you guys would've had Dinwiddie if he hadn't gotten a season-ending injury at the start of the year, Aldridge retired midseason, Joe Harris randomly forgot how to shoot, Landry Shamet's a quality bench player.  You guys just got unlucky, I really don't think the answer was keeping additional bench players instead of Harden."
If you had even swapped joe Harris and Bruce brown’s minutes throughout the course of the series it would have been beneficial to the nets.  Do I really have to break it down to that level to appease you people? It’s not that hard to decipher what I’m trying to say.   Brown played 4 minutes in game 6 ffs
Joe Harris really shit himself. Dude lost himself a lot of money this series
"When you build a team around 3 max players you're going to have trouble when only 1 of those is truly healthy. Harden couldn't even drive. Realistically it's a strong positive that they even got to game 7.   You can blame Joe Harris, Bruce Brown, whatever but in my eyes they're getting forced into roles they were never meant for. Not in terms of what they're actually doing, but the pressure on them. You can sustain a Joe Harris off night, even off series when he's your fourth most important offensive player. But nobody is saying Joe Harris is built to be your second best player in a playoff series."
"Nah, just 5 games.   Joe Harris from three against the MIL Bucks 2021:  G1 5/9 G2 3/7  =&gt; 8/16 =&gt; 50%  G3 1/7 G4 2/6 G5 1/7 G6 1/4 G7 3/9  =&gt; 8/33 =&gt; ≈ 24.2%  Total: =&gt; 16/49 =&gt; ≈ 32.7%"
"Joe ""same level in shooting with Curry and Klay"" Harris"
joe harris is not a super star
"So tired of this. Harris was bad all series and Harden is on one leg, literally no surprise. Khris hasn't been bad all series and Jrue has been better too, their early game shooting was surprising. They pulled it together when it mattered anyways so it is what it is. No one gives a shit about Joe Harris, some role players shine in the regular season and don't rise to the moment in the playoffs, it happens. I'm a Bucks fan, I've seen it a lot."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-joe-harris-is-right-up-there-with-stephen-curry-klay-thompson-as-a-shooter/amp/
Joe Harris sold the game
If by superteam you mean kd vs the bucks then sure.   Truth is if even Joe Harris showed up bucks would have been done a game or two ago.
Holiday has a game winner in one of the games and he came clutch the 4th quarter. Had much more positive impact than mf Joe Harris
Joe harris..
Well the star 3 point shooter Joe Harris went a nice 3-10  Harden was setting up Blake and Brown but you cant expect them to carry the Nets in crunchtime
So a Joe Harris 3 is a bad play now? What the fuck is this timeline?
We will gladly take a Joe Harris kind sir.
"I can’t imagine watching that game, where literally one made shot by anybody would have been the difference, and blaming joe Harris for the whole thing. But I see you changed flairs to the Knicks so that explains why you have such fucking idiotic opinions"
"Fuck I was the biggest joe Harris fan this year. Turns out without the spacing of 3 stars, hes Fuking asss"
Erm if you wanna be technical:  - Joe Harris because he missed wide open shots the whole series and missed a wide open 3 in an overtime where the total score was 4-2. Also missed a wide open middy in game 3 to put us ahead.   - Harden for getting re-injured.   - Giannis for undercutting Kyrie (Ik it wasn’t intentional).
1. injuries   2. joe harris  3. steve nash
Yea if joe Harris makes even just that wide open 3 at the end the games ending a lot different
Joe Harris sold SO BADLY  One fucking open shot thats all he needed to do in OT...
Who should get those shots instead? Injured Jeff Green? Joe Harris?   Or do you want KD hoisting up 40 shots a game despite being gassed with the amount he was already putting up?
Joe Harris looks so steady and good in the big games. Atleast that was a great sign
I blame you!  But fr its Joe Harris. Harden was hurt and Bruce Brown was great   Nash can't do anything with this hospital team
That still doesn’t change the fact that he’s an ideal role player on paper. No one thinks Joe Harris can create his own shot.
"Only reason Bucks won the series was due to Nets being the Big 1.5 instead of the Big 2/3 for the last 3 games   Other then that, Joe Harris completely shit the bed, he was missing WIDE open 3s and he was suppose to be their 3pt specialist"
Joe Harris is gone. They cannot pay him. I know he didn’t come up big in the Bucks series but he was huge all year. Big loss there
"But even then, he was hitting some crucial late gamers, including that spinning winner in game 3.  In a bajillion million years I wouldn’t trust Bledsoe in those spots. He would’ve made Joe Harris look like prime Reggie."
"He didnt need stars beside him,if he only had guys like joe harris shooting 3point like he did whole seasson this game wouldnt be close"
I’m not hating on Harden the whole reason I was on the nets bandwagon was because I wanted him to win a chip. But he was obviously injured and couldn’t find his shot the whole game at that point he should have realized he shouldn’t have been shooting so much. Joe Harris is just a flat out bum though.
"And how did we get KD in the first place? Signing a trash D’Lo and turned him into gold to trade for KD.   And you think Kyrie would come here if we didn’t have that good ass culture built by the solid team with DLo leading, RHJ, etc… even Joe Harris and Dinwiddie were nobodies before our excellent front office.  We also gave up a SHIT ton of fairly acquired assets like Levert and JA for Harden.  We gave up a lot. Y’all say we bought this shit but we didn’t. We sold our future for a chance to bring a chip.  Y’all need to look at transaction histories before blowing up lame Reddit-based narratives.  If the same strokes of luck came to your team? You wouldn’t be acting like this.   Anyway, I know I wouldn’t change anyone’s minds here. Y’all keep hating.  - Nets fan since 2001"
Joe Harris probably feels like shit rn
Bogdan and Joe Harris 3% went down the toilet this post season.
WTH JOE HARRIS. MIA in this series.
"The Nets lost a game when healthy to the Celtics. The Suns are much better than the Celtics. The Nets can’t guard Jokic at all especially with all of his healthy pieces around him. The Clippers started playing like a different team. Healthy Lebron and AD always make noise. Again the Nets have all the talent to be one of the greatest offensive teams of all time, but they play a lot of ugly isolation ball that can be subject to going hot or cold and they aren’t a great defensive team. Joe Harris started missing wide open 3s."
"if you are a fan of kd i think you should be glad that they lost.  Considering that Harden has a grade 2 strain he will struggle all the way til the end of the playoffs without proper rest. He may even worsen his injury and struggle to return to form next season. And Irving is likely to be missing for the remainder of the playoffs. So kd will have to play 48 mins match-in-match-out in the next series. It is extremely risky considering that he had a serious achilles injury.  As it is unlikely that they would survive til the end of the playoffs and win a chip, they'd better preserve their body, recharge, and come back healthily next season. It is still very likely that they will win a chip next season, as long as they stay healthy and do some proper trades, like trading Joe Harris away.  And now, even the haters of the Warriors dynasty appreciate what KD has done in this series."
Unfortunately Joe Harris
"Bruce brown, Harden &amp; Joe Harris all played a few too many minutes."
Harden played through a grade 2 hamstring strain since game 5. Joe Harris can go take a long walk on a short pier.
Joe Harris should get honorable mention at the trophy presentation if Bucks win the Ring this year.
"Me after Game 3: Bucks can't rely on Joe Harris going 1-11, 1-7 from 3.  Me now: Anyone need a clown for a birthday party?"
It actually was 8/33.   Joe Harris from three against the MIL Bucks 2021:  G1 5/9 G2 3/7  =&gt; 8/16 =&gt; 50%  G3 1/7 G4 2/6 G5 1/7 G6 1/4 G7 3/9  =&gt; 8/33 =&gt; ≈ 24.2%  Total: =&gt; 16/49 =&gt; ≈ 32.7%
":( I feel bad for you, Joe Harris really disappointed since Game 3. So frustrating to think that KD could've won the game in regulation if his foot wasn't on the line."
Joe Harris is the only guy I can point to and say (injuries aside) that if he played better his team would still be in the playoffs.
Joe “Danny Green” Harris
"You said ""all of his minutes"" - how would he have taken all of Joe Harris' minutes when he played 50+ minutes last night? Joe Harris played 47 minutes, overlapping nearly all with Brown's 52.  You're not making any sense."
"To bad KD had zero help, no gas left in Ot and no gas left for Giannis by 4th quarter, didn’t even look like rest of nets even worked up a sweat bricking everything.. joe Harris …"
"What inability to shoot is this lol? His FG percentage last night was better than KD's, his 3PT percentage was equal to that of Joe Harris (better than flop Harden) and his FT percentage was better than PG Luka Doncic in Game 5 against the Clippers."
"Ryan Andersen, Eric gordon, joe Harris, landry shamet. There's a reason its called the big balls dance and those 4 never done it."
"I had to read so many ""Joe Harris is a better 3pt shooter  than Curry, just look at the %"" takes this season my God."
Harden and Joe harris sold so hard yikes
"He’s the type of guy you pay and keep when you’re a contender. Plays defense, rebounds and doesn’t need the ball. You don’t pay one-dimensional shooters like Joe Harris."
Joe Harris has been straight poop. I remember the series he played against us 2 years ago where he played in a similar awful way. Dude isnt built for the playoffs
They kind of hunted him by putting him in actions I thought. But they attacked Joe Harris who might be worse than Harden on one leg.
"Joe Harris was STRAIGHT UP TRASH this series.  This loss is on him.  If that dude made ONE a shot down the stretch in game 7, Nets win the game.  Just down right scared and shook in the moment"
"Amazing game but not impressed with Joe Harris. Couldn't hit the broad side of a barn on multiple wide open shots and provided mediocre defense. He at least has good decision making when the ball is in his hands, knows what he can and can't do.  Definitely looked like one of those regular-season-only snipers."
joe harris
Joe Harris numbers wow
Joe Harris has entered the chat
"Primarily spot-up shooters are typically streaky. Joe Harris' offensive game might not exactly be limited to just C&amp;S opportunities, but that's certainly his bread and butter. And it just so happens he hit a rough stretch, and had nothing else to fall back on, so his rhythm suffered even more."
Joe Harris doing his best Lakers player impression. Build up good 3 pt percentagr in season and shit the bed when it matters
So youre saying Joe Harris shot 33% on open shots?
The best part is the guy saying not to trade joe Harris is probably a proper fan compared to the guy yelling trade everyone except the stars is a bandwagon
with one legged harden and joe harris? hell nah. Joe harris couldn't hit shit. JR smith is better.
"I think while they didn't always execute perfectly offensively, their defensive IQ allowed them to win. They made 3-Point Champion Joe Harris look like a scrub out there. Contained Kyrie fairly well while he played. Made KD work the hardest he's had to work in years."
no way did bud get outcoached with joe harris playing 40 useless minutes  nash sabotaged himself with his game 7 rotations  shamet was better all series outside of game 1
"Lmao found the teenage superteam bandwagon fan   If Harden's injury was bad he wouldn't have been cleared to play. He just choked like the bitch he is, same as Joe Harris"
"Joe Harris and Ben Simmons are not exactly what you would call ""valuable property."""
"Everyone was gassed , the only player that aren't heavily gassed .. cough.. Joe Harris ... Cough... Is trash"
KD Joe Harris and very favorable refing also Harden still put up 20 even if most of it was from bullshit phantom foul free throws
"Lmao now joe Harris trash right? Didn’t Giannis play with an equally inconsistent squad. Y’all acting like Middleton showed up every game. They both had a supporting cast that showed up sometimes and sometimes they didn’t. I saw it as a fair competition and kd as usual, by himself can’t win against another team with an equal roster."
No Joe Harris to save the Bucks now.
"Worst part about joe Harris being a sleeper agent is now we have to hear all over again about how everything is solely bud’s incompetence, and not just a pretty lame team altogether"
I thought Joe Harris played for the Nets LOL. That was WIDE open.
Didn’t know joe harris was playing today
OH NOOOOOOO airballed the open 3? Who does he think he is... Joe Harris?
And here I thought Joe Harris was eliminated last round.
People forget the bucks nearly lost to KD with some g leaguers (and ice cold joe Harris)
Jesus and to think joe Harris could hit 2-3 more shots and we wouldn’t have to watch bud continue to suck
Joe Harris
"Not sure about Cade, who hasn't played an NBA game yet, or Hayes, who was injured for most of his rookie year.   However, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart have already established their roles and skillsets.   Bey was one of the best sharpshooters in that class, shooting 38% on 6 attempts per game. In fact, he made more 3s his rookie year than anyone else in his class period. With improvements on the defensive end, he will be a 3 and D wing ala Klay Thompson or Joe Harris. Even without D, Kyle Korver managed to have a fruitful 17 season career and was even an All Star.   Stewart was the best center in the class, full stop. He was easily the best rim protector in the entire class and he had a clean scoring touch around the rim and even the ability to pop the 3 every now and again. There is a reason Pistons fans are trying to get him to meet with Ben Wallace because he's Ben Wallace but with the ability to score."
Joe Harris was pretty good in the World Cup! He's just not even close to one of the best guys the team had to offer.
"No I wouldn't, and you're not getting my point. Nobody outside of GSW thought that KD going to the Warriors as a free agent was good for the league.  Imagine if Harden went to Brooklyn without Brooklyn having to give up most of their playoff core, and without them having to mortgage their future. Would you see a team with KD, Kyrie, Harden + Joe Harris, Levert, Jarrett Allen, Dinwiddie, and Taurean Prince as fair, especially if they had their first rounders every subsequent year?"
Joe Harris?
"Lots of redundancy with this team. My roster would be: Guards: Dame, Jrue, Joe Harris, Booker, Mitchell Forwards: Durant, Tatum, Middleton, Adebayo, Bridges Centers: Wood, Towns"
"lol its really impossible to win with Joe Harris, what a loser"
"That team was flawed and just not very deep. That team also had Derrick White, Joe Harris and Mason Plumlee on it. If you would've taken two of those guys off and replaced them with Durant and Dame that probably changes things significantly. That team didn't have *The Guy*"
"we shouldn't be seeing that, but injuries and joe harris.."
"He should prob just delete this whole dumb ass post lol. This is basically the same thing as that fake Bruce Bowen quote from the other day. Just straight up falsely attributing shit to people that were never even involved in a conversation to begin with.  Hilarious how outraged this sub gets at people on TV doing some playful ribbing, yet 90% of ppl on here can’t be bothered to get very simple basic facts right and have no problem letting other people’s names get dragged thru the mud and let completely fabricated shit get thousands of upvotes  If Stephen a Smith did some careless shit like this and called Joe Harris “JJ Reddick” or some shit, OP would probably have a post calling for him to get fired over it lmao"
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it’s not the league’s fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here’s a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there’s a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
Example: Joe Harris running his ass off on defense and not being able to shoot because of it
You’re assuming he would receive the same defensive treatment he does today as the team’s third option. This is the same logic used by people who try and argue Joe Harris is a better catch-and-shoot guard than Steph or Klay.

"simmons is not a good rim protector so having him as a small ball 5 is not great. Guarding 5s is literally the weakest part of his defensive game. Also the nets playoff defense was pretty good, they don't really NEED to improve their defense. They p much only need some buy out/cheap big man to play during the regular season and for certain matchups.  giving the 76ers kyrie makes a direct competitor better, directly making it harder for the nets to make the finals. And also KD may opt out if they trade kyrie which is ggs for the nets team  Kyrie is also already a secondary ball handler.  Anyways the nets went 7 games +OT with a legit contender while missing kyrie for 3.5 games, harden for 4 games (and basically missing for the last 3), KD playing his first season back from an achilles injury, and Joe Harris going through the biggest slump of his career. The bucks literally had the 2nd best odds at a title in the preseason and the 5th best before playoffs in the league. If they just resign dinwiddie, maybe pick up someone like mcgee or dwight, and run it back they will be favs next season."
Luke is what everyone thought joe Harris was in the playoffs lol
"To me, I need to see the perimeter defense for the Bucks against the Hawks. I haven't been a fan of their perimeter defense (I felt Joe Harris sucked and not because of the Bucks defense). Suns would take advantage of it."

Ben Simmons and Joe Harris
Sign-and-trade but they'd have to give Dinwiddie phat stax of cash. But agreed w/ the other person who responded about throwing in Joe Harris- he's a perfect complement to Simmons too.  I know it sounds crazy based on his previous trade value but I almost wonder if the Sixers would need to throw in a protected first at that point though.
"Blake, shamet, Joe Harris, harden and Kyrie. Do I need to say more? Lol im done with this. Clearly a bron hater troll."
"I mostly agree, and I honestly believe Tucker was the better defensive assignee for Durant.  At the same time, it wasn't a good look for Giannis to guard the cornerman (usually the oft-cold-handed Joe Harris) rather than doubling Durant, especially during the latter's historical Game 5.  Logical or not, he was panned for passing up that match-up after that Game 5 letdown, and it would not have been swept under the rug if he lost this series.  It was just a silly argument regurgitated by the more myopic fans who care more about attractive narratives than they do about logical basketball decisions."
"This is interesting ideas, undermined by saying that high 30s% for 3PT% is below average. For whom? Steph Curry? Joe Harris had the highest 3 point percentage of qualified players and he shot 47.5%.  According to Basketball Reference, among all players in the NBA, league median is halfway between Dylan Windler (33.8%) and Terrance Ross (33.7%). Embiid is 70th percentile and Harris is 78th percentile. Among ""qualified"" players, it's a little different, but they're still above the median for qualified players.  It's an interesting idea to sell high, especially since they have 5 years of team control on Simmons. I don't think it's interesting enough to entertain offers other than KD &amp; Harden or LeBron &amp; AD for Embiid because they haven't exhausted all of their options with Embiid yet. They can load-manage him super hard like Raptors Kawhi, eat the fines, still make the playoffs since they've shown they can still get the 1 seed missing Embiid for a lot of the time anyway, and give it a go that way.  As for the idea of selling high, now that Tobias Harris's contract looks a lot less bad, maybe they should sell on him to try to get a couple of players, especially decent bigs that can eat up minutes while Embiid rests. Idk how possible that is."
"Ft% correlates with good shooting touch and is certainly a part of it, but I would push back on it being the most important shooting stat or necessarily ""very indicative"". It's influenced heavily by mentality and the frequency with which you get to the line. As an example, most would consider Joe Harris to be an ""elite shooter"" (at least before the egg he laid in the most recent season) yet he's a career 78% free throw shooter."
"Ok, well Middleton didn't get three 3 point fouls because he only had 1 instance of getting the 3 attempts at the line once for the game. And that was also on a ISO on Joe Harris."
"No, Kevin Durant was carrying his team. Played ridiculous minutes, Harden playing through a grade 2 hamstring strain and not even close to the level he is usually at, Kyrie out, Joe Harris shooting terrible when he the best 3pt shooter in regular season. Nothing but props to Durant"
"What game were you watching? Middleton got his 4 point plays from ISOs. The first one, Joe Harris just runs right into him trying to contest and the 2nd one, Harden clips his legs trying to contest.  https://youtu.be/u_oSk8wTUpk  https://youtu.be/uJTstoAvIgo"
"Kd still had kyrie for most of the playoffs and harden came back and offered what he could. Nets had great role players like Blake and green.   The lakers had no spacing. The nets have way better shooting. Fucking Jeff green had like 7 threes in game 5, nobody is capable of doing that on the lakers. Joe Harris is always here attention even if he sucked  Kd has never carried a team as bad as the lakers. He wouldn’t do shit on the team without AD"
"I dunno, a lot of poor man's Klay types like Redick, Joe Harris and Korver can't raise their game in the postseason, all seeing at least a 2% TS and a 2 ppg dropoff from the regular season to the playoffs while being targeted on defense at times.  Klay's already far superior numbers barely budge and Klay clearly stepped it up on the other end come playoff time.  I think his athleticism gave him the ability to raise his game in big moments and guard the best opposing wing scorer, saving Steph the energy and fouls. Even if Klay didn't jump very high he ran fast and a lot, changing directions sharply and often.  IMO his athleticism was the difference between being a clear top ten guy at his peak and one of the relatively replaceable players I mentioned earlier."
"I think Scottie is wrong. The Nets needed KD to score. They had nobody else to create shots. If Joe Harris hits an open  3 pointer then the Nets would have probably won the game. The narrative would have been ""KD wills the Nets to victory."""
I’d give the  edge to the sixers support just off of Seth playing amazing. Tobi was alright. Tbf to the nets tho Blake griffin was playing pretty nice and Jeff green was big in game 6. If joe Harris looked like his normal self I feel like it’d be pretty even since the sixers supporting cast outside of Tobi and Seth didn’t do much and Danny was out
Joe Harris blew his shot
"At first I thought he was trying to say LeBron gets his teammates more involved, but look at the 2018 Run that mfer just said Ill do it cause none of yall can shoot for shit.  Same for KD this series.. Whose he going to pass to? 1 legged Harden oh oh even better Joe 4.7% FG Playoffs Harris?  Weird slant from Scottie lol"
"Joe Harris isn't getting paid $170 million and nobody criticized his play style, miss or make Joe Harris was taking those shots, Ben refused to even look at the rim."
"Its 109m this year probably 112m or 115m next year but yeah, Nets are way over the cap and into the luxury tax (132m).  Harden at 43.8m, Durant at 40.9m, Kyrie at 34.9m, Joe Harris at 17.7m, DJ at 9.8m. It’s brutal."
"The big 3 all still have 1 year left on their  contract, Joe Harris has 3 more years, and Blake would have to sign for a minimum which.. since Detroit bought out 2 years of his contract, he probably doesn't care about what he signs for since this next year is paid for by the Pistons already and he wants a ring"
"Joe Harris isn’t a great defender by any means, but it’s not like Middleton had a great series.  He shot well in two games and ok in one other.  They were hunting griffin on switches"
"I would assume he's talking about KD, PG and Kyrie rather than the Joe Harris types. Or else he's smoking bad weed."
"Hey, this is just pure speculation but do you think a line up of James Harden, Kyrie Irving, KD, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin would work in today’s nba? Offensively they’d be a monster but I feel like opposing teams would constantly score 120+ points on them every game."
I had a similar sentiment towards Joe Harris.
&gt; well-rounded supporting cast  Yeah gonna have to disagree here. Joe Harris was a walking brick all series. Bruce Brown single handedly choked game 3. Blake Griffin was alright. Jeff Green was playing on 1 leg and only played like 4/7 games. Everyone else on the team was a nobody + Harden is not built for the playoffs.
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
"Even on one leg he shouldve been better than 2/11 from three. Hell, all they needed was Joe harris to make those 2 wide open threes and they would've won."
"2011-2021   PG - Ben Simmons   SG - Tony Allen   SF - Thabo Sefolosha   PF - Kristaps Porzingis   C - Rudy Gobert    Bench - DeRozan, Dwight Howard, Joe Harris"
He absolutely showed up offensively in the playoffs. Look at Joe “Klay” Harris
"Y’all such prisoners of the moment 😂 Joe Harris had a bad series too so I guess just throw him off a bridge next year since he’s not one of the best shooters in the league…playoff duds happen. Kobe tanked a game 7 by not shooting on purpose, I’m sure he was junk after that too."
"To be fair, Joe Harris couldn't get Joe Harris a basket"
"Bucks go cold and brainless at times but they just have so many weapons. Giannis does his thing, khris can drop 40, jrue can hit timely shots and defends great. Brook Lopez hits his threes and gets blocks. Hell even Pat connaughton had timely shots in the first half last game. Meanwhile nets couldn't get a joe Harris basket."
Playoff Joe Harris
Joe Harris would be publicly executed
"I’d like to see a super team of Simmons, Joe Harris, Kyle kuzma, and porzingas"
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxf2jTbYgNQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxf2jTbYgNQ)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioTMmK34ibc  compare the contests on joe harris vs the contest on clippers players game 6. You can't be genuinely this igorant.
"Just compare how they defended joe harris vs how jazz defended terrance man. Cmon man you can't be this slow. Joe harris got open threes from defensive breakdown, the bucks didn't scheme to leave him open."
"Harden without KD and Kyrie would have zero chance against the Bucks, did you see Joe Harris laying a brick foundation that Series?"
Joe Harris literally the day before
Not Joe Harris lol
"Doing this next to KD, harden, and Joe Harris though… a lot more space. Kyrie was the 1st option doing this maybe 10% of the time"
"&gt;How about Giannis stepping under Kyrie?  You mean Kyrie stepping on Giannis toe? Unintentional.   &gt;KDs big ass toe being on the line?  If he was a little further back he might have missed it, since you want to play that game.   &gt;Joe Harris going ice cold on open 3s.  Played great defense on him.   &gt;I don’t think you can find a Bucks fan that honestly thinks they deserved to win that series.  Thank you Toronto fan for speaking for every Bucks fan but we 100% earned winning that series. Bucks played their asses off and our second star didn't even play well all series.   &gt;Giannis doesn’t even need to be guarded outside of the paint lol.  Coming from someone that was probably campaigning hoping that Giannis would come play for your team last year.   STFU, be grateful for the lucky ring you got with a Kawhi rental. If the Bucks get a ring this year, they deserve it 100%, have worked hard for it the last 3 years, and every player on the team has worked extremely hard to get there. It won't be just because we rented a Kawhi for a half of season."
Toronto got lucky? Lmao  How about Giannis stepping under Kyrie? KDs big ass toe being on the line? Joe Harris going ice cold on open 3s. I don’t think you can find a Bucks fan that honestly thinks they deserved to win that series. Except you cuz you’re delusional. Siakam is probably slightly overrated sure - Giannis doesn’t even need to be guarded outside of the paint lol.
"Harrison Barnes missed open shots. It was a choke, but that happens all the time. Joe Harris this season, for example.  Simmons was too scared to throw down a wide open dunk. We gotta emphasize how unprecedented that is lol"
Are you trying to tell me that Joe Harris doesn't count as a third star
call me joe harris cause i’m shooting 20% from 3 😤
"To be clear, I don't think any of us are legitimately referring to the FO when we're talking about ""The Heat"" - we're talking about the fans here on r/NBA. I don't recall the Heat FO ever coming out and saying much of anything about the potential of a Harden trade, let alone saying they wouldn't pull the trigger because of Herro. It was your fans that were saying that stupid shit.  The Nets lost because of injuries, let's be real. Dinwiddie season-ending injury 3 games in already fucked their guard depth, LaMarcus Aldridge retired, Kyrie out for the series, Harden grade 2 hamstring that clearly killed his on-court performance when he tried to return early, Joe Harris straight up forgetting how to shoot - that team absolutely fucking ***collapsed*** and that's not an indictment on any one player and certainly doesn't support the argument that Herro, Simmons, or whoever is more valuable than Harden."
"Nah, joe Harris was great in games 1-2 vs the bucks. In games 3-7 bucks made him guard Middleton. He’s just not good under pressure and when you Make  him guard on the perimeter it takes his legs away. Same thing happened vs the sixers last playoffs. Many Nets fans didn’t even want him to start in the playoffs. Nets likely trade him"
"Kennard balled out last series, you mean Joe Harris"
"Putting up monstrous numbers in the first half and then disappearing in overtime is what you mean. TBF Joe Harris *also* scored 0 in OT, but no one is trying to claim he is the best player in the league"
"Lmao. Worst take I've seen. If Joe Harris wasn't a trash can, they would have won. Empty stats is a fallacy. Putting up monstrous points on great efficiency is not empty stats."
"Agreed, any one that puts all of their hopes onto Joe Harris and expecting him to be a difference maker is an idiot. He had a lot of good looks, they just didn't fall, it's bad luck and just how the game goes. There was a whole team alongside him that also crumbled multiple times. At the end of the day the injuries killed the nets, they're pretty much nothing without at least 2 of the big 3 playing in full health."
Go ahead and add Kevin Porter Jr to the Cavs’ list  Can’t believe we traded him and Joe Harris for nothing
First year watching Joe Harris in the playoffs?
Joe Harris shot 19% from three in the playoff two years ago..
the role players aren't a problem IMO.  Joe Harris was HORRENDOUS this series but he would be picked up by every team in the league.  dinwiddie was hurt and unfortunately probably will sign elsewhere.  shamet has been a starter around the league.  TLC has been good.  Jeff Green and Griffin are solid.    I think nash needed to switch up from harris in games 6 and 7.  TLC absolutely should have been given some run.
It doesn’t matter. Joe Harris has consistently under performed in the playoffs for years. He just could not hit open shots.
"Glad the Celtics aren't afraid to make moves.   What gets me is r/nba will talk about trading Ben Simmons, firing Doc, trading Joe Harris, getting rid of Schroder, but when the Celtics do moves to actually make their team better it's. OMG they'll never get any top free agents, or omg no loyalty"
"With all due respect, that’s why most people didn’t really care when Joe Harris won the 3p contest"
"They also aren't really calculating the toll asking  Joe Harris to guard Khris Middleton is going to take.  Harris isn't exactly a great defender normally, but you're asking him to expend all sorts of energy on one end of the floor and then be good on the other one.  Wasn't going to end well.  You don't need to move on from him, but you need to bring in some better wing defenders so you have options."
"there's many reasons why teams lose players.  I almost don't fault teams when they lose stars but if they cannot grow or improve role players, that's on them.  like Detroit cut dinwiddie and let wood go for nothing.  Cleveland cut Joe Harris.  I think magic did too but I could be wrong.  nets took those 2 and made them key contributors.  same with TLC"
They were literally a decent Joe Harris away from winning the series lmao
I mostly disagree.  Maybe they can make some marginal changes in their depth or sign one or two more people but the surrounding cast is fine.  The issue is both Harden and Kyrie being injured to the point where they basically can't (or in Harden's case ideally shouldn't) play.    The roster around those 3 is enough to win a championship.  The health of the big 3 was the problem.  Brooklyn could have weathered Joe Harris' garbage ass shooting if healthy Harden or Kyrie played.
Having spencer is nice but kinda pointless with Kyrie/Harden. Joe harris is good but having a defender in Simmons would be important for Brooklyn
"Yes, he is a great pick for a mid 20s selection, one bad series for a streaky shooter doesn’t change that. It shouldn’t for Joe Harris, it shouldn’t for covington, it shouldn’t for korkmaz"
"He scares the shit out of me when he plays like he did. It's tough because if Joe Harris doesn't play awful and Kyrie and Harden don't get hurt, then you probably win the ship. Kyrie can't stay healthy which could be a problem for future championship aspirations."
"Would have to trade Joe Harris. He went from being basically one of the main options to the 4th or 5th option and he still signed an extension. Granted he thought he would win a ring, but he could have signed elsewhere and been a bit more of a focal point. Was awful in the Bucks series, but I don't see him repeating that poor performance next year."
"i can see something brewing, Myles is a texas guy and we know how much KD loves them. Harris is still the league leader in 3pt%. Nets will need to add this years pick and  claxton. I would try and grab tj warren if Marks can work some magic.  A joe harris, claxton, DJ and pick for Myles and TJ works, salary wise."
joe harris/ dj / claxton for turner and warren
Wherever joe harris goes
"LeBron went up against elite defences that were all purpose-built to specifically defend him. Boston and Toronto were top 5 defenses who's entire identity centered on stopping LeBron.  Which came about because he'd spent a decade dominating the East. Teams would gameplan their offseasons around him.   Durant, being new in the East, hasn't experienced that. KD went up against Milwaukee, who have a defence that emphasizes letting guys shoot.  LeBron was beating rock with scissors, KD was beating rock with paper.  &gt;Their role players had wide open shots and were bricking them  The Cavs were one of the worst shooting teams of all time those playoffs. LeBron still had them scoring against elite defenses. Joe Harris actually shot better than Kevin Love."
"Joe Harris, or Spencer Dinwiddie in a S+T"
As a nets fan it has got to so super frustrating watching players just not shoot   Joe Harris did the same. For 3 qtr in game 7 he looked to pass everytime he got the ball. They do way more harm than good
Right. A bad series is what joe Harris had for the nets when he couldn’t hit a three to save his life. Ben Simmons passed up an open dunk because he’s afraid of shooting. That’s another level.
"Simmons plays like a bench role player picked in the second round, funny to watch. Need a team with Simmons, Joe Harris, Porzingis, CJ McCollum, Rudy Gobert call it the all-exposed team"
This is such a dumb take because all else aside KD was a centimeter away in regulation and a missed wide open joe harris three away in OT from being well on his way to the finals anyways
"I wouldn’t say Kawhi was meh in the beginning... He won finals MVP in year 3 and in doing so made Lebron James scared. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Ia2InBHDY&amp;t=60s  Think about that. Here is a third year player who is making the guy who is the face of the league look over his shoulder and start cursing.  Huerter is a good player, but he’s not exactly putting the fear of god into the likes of Lebron, Durant etc. when he comes in.    I see him ultimately being like Joe Harris, a role player who will shoot some 3s... a poor man’s Klay. If you look at Joe Harris and him they have very similar numbers.  Klay has never shot below .400 for 3pt in his season average ever... not 1 season.  Heurter best 3pt is .385 his rookie year.  He’s a good player but this is probably all you will see out of him, who knows he might be able to improve his game, but more than likely this is what his role is and it’s not going to expand much."
Some poor personel decisions in the playoff series against an opposing coach who was renowned for incompetence.      Why waa he playing Joe Harris so much? Jeff Green so little. Overall really poor given their talent.
this is entirely Joe Harris' fault.
"Common man. The Cavs looked dominant in the regular season, but they still had flaws. Apart from Lebron and Delonte West, nobody on the team could create their own shot to save their lives.   Mo Williams was at most a 5th option on a legit contender and the Cavs were depending on him to be the second star on offense. Regular season basketball is very different from the playoffs.   We see how role players efficiency usually go down the drain in tight and physical playoff games.   We just saw it happen with Joe Harris. Ben Wallace was out of his prime, Big Z was slow as hell, they both got dominated by Dwight Howard. The refs actually did everything to help the Cavs by calling soft fouls on Howard lol. This way when he was out of the game, it helped Lebron get to the basket easier and Wallace could rest his old bones.   Verajao is just an energy guy. There to set picks and rebound, he is a liability everywhere else. The Magic were a match-up nightmare. Turkoglu was roided up and playing like Magic Johnson.   Completely controlling the games and carving the Cavs defense up. Pietrus, Reddick, Rashad Lewis were all more talented than the role players for the Cavs and better shooters too."
It just took two of the three best Nets players being injured and Joe Harris being absolute dogshit. The Bucks still almost lost in the second round and would have if KD feet wasn't too big.
Marcus Morris sr is better than Joe Harris
"Stop. ""Reporters"" have literally made their career based on bashing LeBron for not beating far superior teams in the Finals. People were hating on KD this year for not carrying the Ghost of James Harden and...Joe Harris?...to the ECF and Finals. Giannis is a 2x MVP in his prime. Actually, he's so young still he may still be entering his prime. Yeah, at that point, nothing matters but postseason success. Nothing. Last postseason, his #1 seed team lost in five in the second round...and the only game they won was when he was out."
2018 Brooklyn is pretty radically different - I believe just Joe Harris is left.
"I think if you replaced Kyrie with a healthy steph, harden with a healthy klay, Blake with draymond, Joe Harris with iggy but like from 4 years ago, and Steve Nash with Steve Kerr (but Steve Nash could stay on as like a shooting consultant)  you might have a pretty good team."
"The Bucks did NOT beat a superteam. If anything, that series shouldn't have gone to 7 with joe harris turning into andre roberson shooting 3's and harden playing on one leg. Healthy Nets g sweep that series in 5."
"Joe Harris, Harden, Mike James, Tyler Johnson. All these guys can hit open 3’s.   And it would only be 2 minutes a half. KD had enough energy for 48 minutes. If they rested him 2 minutes a half he still would have something left in OT. With your reasoning Lebron would never come out of the game or Luka."
Haren being a lame duck and Joe Harris forgetting how to catch and shoot didn’t help either.  I just think people blame coaches wayyyyy too much.  Players decide who wins and who looses.  Bucks were the better team in that series.
"Let’s put it into perspective… Davis Bertans and Joe Harris is worth around $20m/year… the rookie max is around $25m/year.   Ask this simple question… would you rather have said player than Davis Bertans/Joe Harris? If the answer is yes, they will be maxed"
"Zizek is a fine example here. Though hardly the only example, the “debate” there is pretty illustrative of the word salad charge. Peterson spends the entire time trying to blame all that he feels has befallen society on “post-modern Marxism” (aka college kids) - in the exact way he does to rubes like Joe Rogan and his audience who buy into it wholesale - to an academic who spent his life studying Marxism. The result is ugly.   Peterson even admits in the debate that his only exposure to Marxism is from having read the Communist Manifesto when he was a kid. This would be like someone trying to debate the history of Ancient Rome having only read the Bible. You’re going in there with very limited information and history, and from only one particular point of view.   It’s even worse than that in this case, because Peterson’s “argument” doesn’t even relate to the Manifesto. He name drops it because it’s the one popular leftist text he can even name. He doesn’t even begin to know what someone like a Hegelian believes, and he’s completely ignorant of the literature as a whole. Again, fine when he’s dunking on college kids in those “DESTROYS sjws” youtube videos; not so much when faced with someone who actually knows what they’re talking about.   The result is predictable - Peterson continuously rants about how “postmodern Marxist society” is destroying our values and Zizek, in so many words, asks him what the fuck he’s talking about and if he can name even one person who falls under this label. Peterson cannot.   And Zizek respects him? He had this to say about Peterson:  &gt; During an event at the Cambridge Union in November 2018, Žižek had called Peterson's work ""pseudo-scientific"", labeled him as his ""enemy"" and criticized Peterson's work on the idea of a cultural Marxism, stating that ""[h]is crazy conspiracy theory about LGBT+ rights and #MeToo as the final offshoots of the Marxist project to destroy the West is, of course, ridiculous.""  Sound familiar?  They are somewhat sympatico on the subject of political correctness, but that’s really about it.   Beyond Zizek there’s also Peterson’s infamous debate with Sam Harris, a person whom I don’t even like at all, but who is far more intelligible. And where once again, Harris tries to cut through the endless word salad and fails to, so they end up having an inane hours-long discussion about the meaning of word “truth” that offers absolutely no insight. Just like how Zizek kept trying to get Peterson to precisely define “post-modern Marxist” and out kept coming gobbledygook (because it is), and round and round we go.   No one listening even ends up learning anything because one side of the debate is just completely unintelligible and has nothing useful to say."
"$1 Million is very little relative to the injury risks for a lot of players   Look at a team like this years Nets. They struggled with health issues all season. Ignoring their superstars, Joe Harris is being paid $72 Million on this contract. The million dollar bonus isn’t enough to risk an injury in a random event"
If he nails those 3s. Joe Harris showed what happens if anyone keeps feeding the ball to a cold shooter.
"Nah not ever but still great. The Nets recently just had a starting lineup of Harden, KD, Kyrie, Blake and Joe Harris"
"Uhhh hell no. Dinwiddie didn't even play and Joe Harris was doing nothing but being a brickhouse with his shots even when he was wide open. Nothing like Klay Thompson as some people were saying. If Kyrie wasn't injured, the series would have ended differently lol."
"Uhhh hell no. Dinwiddie didn't even play and Joe Harris was doing nothing but being a brickhouse with his shots even when he was wide open. Nothing like Klay Thompson as some people were saying. If Kyrie wasn't injured, the series would have ended differently lol."
"That's how the playoffs have to go. Superstars can be superstars, but without the other role players stepping up, teams become lost causes. Looking at the Nets with Joe Harris, or the Heat with Tyler Herro."
Saric doing his best Joe Harris rn
"hes 5th fiddle behind joe harris, harden, and dinwiddie"
Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. Schroeder can run an offense and plays very good defense... For 4M less than Barnes. It's a bad contract. They could probably move him for something decent after next season.
"Yeah, HB is considerably better than Joe Harris and Schroeder. LeVert is streaky but I'd take HB by a margin. I don't blame you for not watching the Kings, but HB is great."
You realize 16M buys you Dennis Schroeder/LeVert/Joe Harris?
If you really wanted to make a more balanced team you’d try to trade Joe Harris for a legitimate rim protector. KD/Kyrie/Harden is more than enough scoring. Y’all need some defence to be more balanced. Maybe a sign and trade with Nerlens Noel.
"Man I watched every Bucks game this playoffs I'm just shitposting the ""Why is Giannis in the corner guarding Joe Harris instead of Kevin Durant"" meme"
Joe Harris choke as well
"The difference in quality between Durant and the rest of the team was massive. When an injured Harden who cant even run is clearly your 2nd best player, you know you’re in deep shit.  Bruce Brown and Joe Harris are decent role players, but you cant expect them to win you a playoff series. Joe Harris especially, was completely shut down because he’s such a one dimensional player (ala JJ Redick) that he will always struggle to make shots in the playoffs.  And Im pretty sure Jeff Green was injured too."
"At the end of the day, you have to put points on the board. The “spacing” provided by the abysmal shooting of people like KLove or Iman Shumpert is comfortably offset by the fact that they shot terribly. You and I both know that there’s a larger context that proves LeBron simply was the better player in this comparison, and a box score isn’t what’s necessary to make the point. There’s a lot of complexity to what determines success in an NBA game. There are things that the OKC team around Durant were much better at than the Cavs around LeBron were. Spacing is just one piece of the puzzle. I don’t think anyone was rushing to argue how Joe Harris was making KD’s life so much easier with all that spacing."
"Last 3 regular seasons: 1st, 2nd, 9th in defensive rating in the NBA   Last 3 postseasons: 1st, 5th, 1st in defensive rating in the NBA   jOe HaRRiS hEhE"
"You think he’s getting 36 mpg and over 10 3PA on the Lakers? That’s cute, he would not even start over KCP.  Also great job telling me who he’s better than on defense (nobody)  Joe Harris is also on a bad contract and Duncan Robinson is a much more rounded player than Buddy. You getting worked up and ignoring my points to cry about what I “can’t and can’t say” on a sports subreddit is adorable bud, just take this L and crawl back to our sub.   Buddy was the second worst defender on a historically bad defense and barely averages 16 ppg on 35 mpg. Cry about it."
"Jesus Christ you’re delusional. The only people that come close to his 3 point shooting are superstars. He shoots the same % and attempts per game as Dame. Shooting is the most valuable NBA skill. There’s a reason why Duncan Robinson is asking for $20m and why Joe Harris got $19m.  &gt;he had to be hid  Just say you don’t watch our games. Buddy stays with guys and gives them issues on ball. His issues are fouling 3 point shooters and getting lost off ball. Like Jesus Christ even if what you were saying *was* true stfu, you shouldn’t be convincing other teams fans that they don’t want buddy Hield."
Here is the truth . In game 7  an injured harden had equal offensive production and efficiency to Middleton. Giannis and KD did Gianni's and KD things and jrue had 14 on catastrophic efficiency that got surpassed by griffin. The game hinged pg tucker somehow being a more efficient player than Joe harris

"Harden in BKN isn't much of a flopper, more of a distributor than a scorer. Averages half the FTA's that Trae does. Now, our drive-to-the-basket guys are Kyrie (who avoids contact) and Joe Harris (who sucks at FT's) so we're really not going to be on the Principal's list often."
"I just don’t get the average defense. I hear Suns fans say it a lot but I can’t see how he’s around the 50th percentile by my eye test or the stats.  For the regular season, epm put him in the 28th percentile of the league with -1.1 making him 360th of 511 in the league. Other 28th percentile guys included Vernon Carey Jr., Jeff Green, Sato. and Okoro. He was 511th in defensive Lebron out of 539 with a -1.58 this past regular season. He didn’t play enough to qualify for their overall playoffs metric (combined multiple postseasons for a better sample size).  His best ever defensive bpm was -1.1 this years playoffs and his best for the regular season was -1.3 in 19-20. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify, he was 77th tied with Rondo His -1.5 in the regular season put him 155th at worst 159th (bballref sorts by the rounded numbers not the ones that go past the hundredth place) tied with CJ, Fox, Joe Harris, and Shamet.  His best stat is d-Raptor which is -0.5 for the full season (regular and playoffs since they recommend at least 1000 minutes for stable results) putting him at 153rd of 250 players. He did very very well in the playoffs with a plus 2 putting him at 27th of 100 qualifying players. That really brought his numbers up because he was at -1.5 for the regular season tied with Garland and Hield for 195th out of 249th."
"Embarrassing comment. Billups averaged 11 ppg in minny. Brandon had 2 solid years before injuries ended his career/Minnesota stint. Sprewell was there for 2 years and fell off a cliff in his second season (retired after). Cassell and KG go to the finals if Cassell doesn't get hurt in the playoffs. Wally was a full blown role player, essentially a rich man's version of Joe Harris.   The one season KG had an actual team around him he took them to the WCF. Foh with that ridiculous take."
"6'3.     I'm making a few assumptions which are necessary to actually evaluate the question.   1) All teams in the NBA have to follow this rule.  Realistically, no team could build around  height limitation and win without everyone else having to.     2) The league has a fantasy draft, the first player you take indicates your height limit.     Here's why.  Most teams are probably going to go big, as not having anyone above 6'4 to defend against opposing big men is a glaring weakness.  That means the players at those heights are going to be split more between those teams.        There are some tall players that can play like guards, but at best teams will have one of those guys (Most tall teams won't have any.)  Realistically, at least one team would choose each inch height between 6'1 and 6'11, no one would choose higher or lower.  Most teams would choose somewhere between 6'5 and 6'10.  It only makes sense to choose a height in the low 6 feet range if you are one of the first teams to pick that height.     So while one team at 6'6 could have Zion, Lavine, Klay, Brown, and Derozan    \- if there are 4 teams at that height, it looks more like   Zion, Derozan, Lonzo, Joe Harris, and Terrance Ross as your starting 5.  With a few okay role players off the bench.  (That being the best of the 6'6 teams)     If there's only one 6'3 team, you could have:   Curry, Beal, Jrue, Fox, Westbrook, Norm, Smart, CJ, Gordon, etc.  If there's two, you could have half of those guys and your worst player as JJ Reddick.     You won't be able to defend against bigs, but most teams will not be able to defend against you at all.  The best 6'3 team probably might not win the title, but it probably goes over .500"
"Yes, he is better than Bryn Forbes by a pretty good margin at this point in their careers , that isnt worth energy. Joe Harris is a good comp, Buddy is marginally better (Buddy is asked to do more than he should be doing and is taking 4 more 3PA a game than Joe), and he is marginally payed more than Joe is. A lot of these guys take hometown discounts to win a title. A guy like Joe Ingles could get paid 3-4 more a year if he wanted to play on a less loaded team. JJ Reddick made 23 million in 2017 for putting up Hield like numbers. When that immediately fell off he regressed to a lower tiered mean (to be fair he was nearing the end of his prime that season alone)."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  First off, I'm not directly comparing Wiggins and Hield, only pointing out that they're similar in that they have value but they are overpaid.  Second, are you saying that Hield is some unicorn as one of ""only about 5 or 6"" players of his caliber from 3 (and I guess midrange)?  How is he different than Joe Harris besides being a bit smaller and a bit worse of a shooter?  [https://stathead.com/tiny/CRa3Q](https://stathead.com/tiny/CRa3Q).  Is he much better than Bryn Forbes (also a shoot only SG)?  Anthony ""48 is my % from 3 and minutes on the bench in the playoffs"" Morrow?  I think you're way overrating Hield because he hasn't been relentlessly exposed in the playoffs on defense, in large part because he's eating up $20m/year and playing bad D."
"He’s a great player no doubt, but shooting like regular season Joe Harris for half the season and shooting like Colin Sexton for rest leaves some level of debate to the ceiling. Obviously, if he shoots like the Joe Harris stretch consistently, he could legitimately be the best player in the league one day.  While still very good at a respectable Colin Sexton level, it lowers the ceiling a bit."
Joe Harris is black?
"Joe Harris, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan when KD was out"
I'll trade u Joe Harris for JV straight up
"(Flashback to Bruce Brown driving to the paint and ignoring Kyrie, KD, and Joe Harris in Game 6)"
"Brooklyn's biggest weakness is their lack of size, which is why they leaned heavily into their biggest strength in the playoffs, which was spreading the floor with shooters and letting their big dogs cook. Milwaukee was able to beat them because of their huge size advantage... and injuries.... Anyways, their size and versatility paid dividends against a small Brooklyn team. None of Blake Griffin, Jeff Green or KD shouldn't be playing center in the playoffs against either Brook Lopez or Giannis.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't know the exact FA pool, but I'm sure a decent center would be willing to take the MLE from Brooklyn in order to compete.  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah I agree Joe Harris sucked in game 7 especially, but he's still a great shooter, and I think he'll step it up next year. If not, the talent of KD Harden and Kyrie is still more than capable of winning it for them."
How does a minimum salary center add any depth though? Joe Harris is barely a role player and if the best they can do is a minimum center then it’ll be a repeat run of this year. Second/Third round exit
"Doesn’t mean you can get him for 15-18 million if he doesn’t have a reliable 3? That’s Joe Harris money. He’s already proven he can get you buckets efficiently with his other tools for nearly a decade at this point? And to your point about the age, Demar doesn’t really rely on his athleticism like most players do. His game lends itself well to aging gracefully due to his elite footwork."
"Agree completely. I've been a broken record but the Olympics in general is young mans game. I'm surprised KD is even out there Tbh.  The best bet is to get like coach spo or monty, and do an 8 year commitment coach k style.   Trae/Don/Ja/Tatum/Zion/Bam/JJJ/Joe Harris/Jarret Allen/Timelord/a Ball brother perhaps. Maybe Ant or someone from these next few drafts. Bring in a dog or 2 like a Brooks. I'm sure I missed a bunch but you get it. Young hungry and eager. Determined to correct the mistake of the last team couldn't hurt either."
There's a list of players that arent ball dominant that would fit next to almost anyone.  Klay  Pg Khris Middleton  Jae Crowder Joe Harris Evan Fournier Desmond Bayne Robert Covington  Tobias Harris  Luka needs a dominant big and some c&amp;s threats.
Joe Harris is making just as mich and Bucks could've had Bogdan if they didn't screw up
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
"Right, I’m sure a roster with Derrick white, joe Harris, Marcus smart, Harrison Barnes and mason plumlee was the very best they could send. If the best players cared they would be there"
"Because we have too much overlap at the guard position and have had that problem for a few years. He is a good starting shooting guard.  Buddy has been a top 3 point shooter for like 4 years. The only players better than him are Steph and Klay. Players you could argue are Trae, Lillard and Joe Harris."
KD would have TLC included in a Joe Harris trade for another star before having to face him in the locker room
"that comment is so misleading lmao. Fiba world cups are so different compared to the oympics where US can bring its best roster. That tournament you mentioned where they finished 7th, had some guys like brook lopez, derrick white, joe harris, harrison barnes clearly not the best roster lmao. Your insane if you don’t believe this roster rn has the potential with better coaching and chemistry to dominate this tournament. I see i international fans always say look at this obscure tournament or exhibition and say see the US isn’t good when there roster is horrible. This was the first olympic loss since 2004, the oympics are the only tournament US actually cares about lmaoo. Compared to past oympics other international teams should still be considered pushovers, they have played teams way better then this france or nigerian teams for example. There are plenty of problems with this roster and USA basketball but actual quality of players isn’t it, ppl love to shit on the US but in reality they could very realistically win gold lmao"
They may be stars but they aint no Joe Harris
Curry is better than Harden though and Klay and Draymond made for a better team than Kyrie and Joe Harris
"Depends on the scenario but some of these have just been insane.  Give up Wiseman and two lottery picks to upgrade Wiggins to...Pascal Siakam?  I get that they kinda have to trade the picks before the draft but I'd really like to see the team play a bit before doing anything if I'm them.  Maybe Wiseman will make the Sophomore leap, maybe Klay is basically Joe Harris now.  Just hate how basketball is feeling more and more like baseball with teams being all-in or going full rebuild."
"COVID had a factor in why Tatum’s % were affected. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, Harden and KD are better than Kyrie who take most of the attention and they also had snipers in Joe Harris. It made the job easier for Kyrie to thrive as a 3rd option."
"The Bucks were really good the final 1.5 series they played. Giannis looked like his playmaking went up a level. But I do not agree at all about what you say about them vs the Nets, mostly because the gap between those teams looked like a canyon.  The Nets lost 2 points out of their 3 headed spear and Joe Harris had the worst set of shooting games of his life and they still almost won. The Bucks looked like the worst team despite coming out from that series and facing the most bare skeleton the Nets could present."
3 games of healthy kyrie. 3 games of harden on one leg. Blake Griffin Is washed up lmfao. Joe Harris was ass. Why are you trying to argue this?
"My wife and I went to the first of the two end of the regular season bucks v nets games at Fiserve, and walked in behind a crowd of people all wearing Joe Harris jerseys. Not quite sure what the connection was, and they were too far in front of us to ask, but seemed weird. There were plenty of Durant/Harden/Irving jerseys scattered around, but the crowd of Joe Harris ones really stuck out."
"5 time Allstar Blake Griffin and NBA 3P% leader Joe Harris are suddenly nobodies. Never mind Kyrie played 4 and Harden 3 in the series.  If you take away the 0-2 headstart Milwaukee give all their opponents, it was a gentleman sweep."
"Joe Harris, the best 3 point shooter in the nba by %.  Blake Griffin &amp; Deandre Jordan, former all-nba players.  Jeff Green &amp; Landry Shamet, starters for other contenders. Bench players for the Nets."
"This is a hard one honestly. We do need to see what the rosters look like.  But if Joe Harris gets the jitters out, I think I favor the Nets, because Harris has led the league in 3pt percentage on volume a few times iirc. So that's just 4 deadly scorers. Meanwhile GSW has Draymond. I assume Wiggins goes in a trade but I don't think it matters even if he doesn't, he's not really a factor."
"People keep up bringing up health, but realistically they could still win as long as they have KD and one of Kyrie/Harden throughout the playoffs.  I mean to be a literal inch away from beating the bucks (and let's be honest they would've breezed through the hawks/suns). And that was with Joe Harris playing like complete ass.   Assuming they play another 4 years together. I'd be really surprised if they don't win 2/4."
"OP surely doesnt watch basketball - longer than 5 years.   5 years ago, you had the World team, just from NBA players:   Manu, Pau, Mills, Bogut, Calderon, Rubio, Rodriguez, Ibaka, Dirk, Gallinari, Dragic, Horford, Tony Parker, Batum, Fournier, Gobert, and younger Simmons, Embiid, Porzingis, Jokic, Antetekoumpo, and so on ..   Add Navarro, De Colo, Lull, Scola ...   Need I remind you that USA team, even though not at full strength, realistically 3rd or fourth best team, finished 7th at world cup 2019 ? Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Middleton, Mitchell, Plumlee, Smart, Tatum, Turner, Kemba, and White  You are underestimating world teams, and Euroleague."
"Add star point guard, Ben Simmons, and add best shooter in the league in Joe Harris. This team achieves the 11 peat."
Joe Harris is ass lmao
Quality shooter followed by Joe Harris or Davis Bertans should never be muttered
The nets were an inch away from knocking them out with a depleted roster and with Joe Harris playing like Joe dirt.
"I feel like the Suns could've taken the hobbled Nets. Mikal, Crowder, Craig, all give KD different looks defensively. Booker would cook one-leg Harden, Mike Brown would get stomped, and Joe Harris would've vanished, and 6'4"" Bruce Brown is not getting boards over them   Claxton's still a little skinny to be guarding Ayton"
Replace Joe Harris with Klay and KD would have had his 3rd FMVP
"Man he took them to OT of game 7 with Joe Harris shooting terrible, washed Blake Griffin, a guy named ""Uncle Jeff"", and Harden on 1 leg. His supporting cast in that series was a bottom 5 team in the league and he still almost won it. Giannis's supporting cast beat the Hawks twice in the ECF."
Not to mention they somehow squeaked out a win in game 3 while playing awful and probably would’ve gotten swept if Joe Harris made a single open shot.
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
He would have been your team's leading scorer this year and him and Lowry have basically the same passing numbers despite demar not having anyone very good to pass to. I wouldn't give him 30 million but basically any team in the league that could afford it would at least give him Joe Harris money
And for a significant stretch of time was the 3rd most accurate 3 point shooter behind Joe ingles and Joe Harris. He also had a really bad slump early in the season and if you adjust that it was probably more around 42%
Umm. No they didn’t. They had joe harris and Bruce brown and a washed up Blake Griffin. Aka 6 guys. You need more than 6 guys to win a ring dude.
Is it regular season or playoffs Joe Harris
Joe Harris forgot how to shoot
"Beal is a bad defender, ik.   But so does harden. He pick the time when he want play any type of defence . Joe Harris is also bad.  Kyrie isn't that much far.  Blake isn't close to being a good defender.   Only KD is somewhat a great weak side help defence defender"
Nets were a KD toe away from winning with 1.5/3 superstars and Joe Harris playing like Anthony Bennett for a series.
…My point is no star players currently play on teams where their second best player is Joe Harris and still take the champions to 7 while having multiple 40 point games …  That is NOT normal in the same way playing Curry Klay spacing is not normal
The same Joe Harris that everybody was gassing up during the regular season? Yeah I saw him shit the bed.
"&gt; healthy harden  That invalidates your entire argument. The dude was playing on one leg for 3 games.  Basically, out of the 14 possible healthy games he could have got from harden/Irving combined, he got 3. And were suppose to applaud giannis for winning? He was guarded by BLAKE FUCKING GRIFFIN. Jrue and PJ Tucker took turns swarming KD and nobody could help him. Did you see what joe Harris did?"
"Danny green, Tristan, Joe Harris, Jae Crowder as well. Cavs in 4"
"James harden was playing on one leg and couldn’t drive or shoot. Irving was injured. Joe Harris was invisible. What good role players? The bucks barely beat KD with no help, that’s not something you brag about"
"It’s tougher than what people realistically think. What’s their whole team going to even look like? Three max guys and Joe Harris is set, but…  Brown, Griffin, Dinwiddie, Jeff Green, and Tyler Johnson are all free agents. Not sure any of those guys resign. The bench is probably going to be razor thin or filled with older vets."
Said Durant and Joe Harris pushed bucks to the brink like Harris wasn’t a bucks player in a nets jersey that series
Lol seeing people call giannis better than kd is jokes too. Kd and joe harris pushed bucks to the brink. They should be embarrassed
"Joe Harris was missing every shot he took, it’s debatable as to whether Blake Griffin is a starting caliber player most of the time, and Harden was injured and absolutely should not have been playing. Your descriptions of them are incredibly disingenuous."
Joe Harris man.... I've never seen someone go so cold when they were touted as one of the best 3 pt shooters. All he needed to do was make maybe 1-2 of his wide open shots and the Bucks were out of the playoffs
"I seem to recall that the NBA leader in 3P% was made redundant by the Bucks stifling defense. Or you think Joe Harris just decided to shoot Nets out of  the series by himself?   Re: Divincenzo, go check defensive rating for the last 2 seasons. Donte was in top 10 amongst ALL players before his injury.   Bucks are 6-4 against Nets this season. Harden played 4 of those games,  Kyrie played 6, KD played all.   Seems like Nets need all their 3 superstars at the same time to beat Giannis. What a shame."
"The role players weren’t even that bad, Blake had a great series and Bruce Brown was up and down but a lot more good than bad. Jeff Green had the game of his life to help them win game 5. Joe Harris was absolutely atrocious after game 2 but just about everybody else was as good or better than you could expect them to be."
Injuries and Joe Harris forgetting how to play basketball.
Put Joe Harris in the dungeon
Or joe Harris and  deandre Jordan xD
"Two players being injured in one series doesn’t put a funk on the whole playoffs. KD was out there, it was players like Joe Harris who shit the bed on that one. He plays even on par with his regular season and they probably win.     Joining a team and steamrolling the league no matter what isn’t the same as the basketball gods throwing fortune your way."
"The only thing fraudish about the Nets is Joe Harris. Everyone else stepped up when they needed to, even defensively. If Kyrie didn't go down, they would have been in the Finals."
What lol Giannis was getting criticized for his defense just hiding on Joe Harris and getting crossed by KD when on him
Kyrie played three games and went down in the fourth so Nets went 2-1 in games that Kyrie fully played in. Harden was clearly on one leg so it's leaving out context to say he played the other three. Reality is that Nets win that series of it was KD and a Joe Harris who could actually hit open shots
"Lmao yup, people have the memory of a goldfish. KD with Harden that couldn't even run and Joe Harris playing like absolute shit still took the Bucks to G7 OT which they barely didn't win because KD has big feet.   Nets are going to be smart and load-manage these guys throughout the year, they'll be good for the playoffs. Hell, all they need is only one of Kyrie or Harden and I'd be confident calling them the favourites in the East."
That's not adding context that's playing whataboutisms. Let's say Kyrie and Harden don't get hurt and they simply play like shit the excuse would be that KD had two teammates who choked. Joe Harris is a 40 percent three point shooter. He choked at shooting threes. That's an anomaly that probably won't happen over a 7 game series again in his career. But guess what? It happened. We can't take credit away from Giannis by playing a whataboutism game.
"Bro kd had peg leg Harden, Blake Griffin and Joe ""what the fuck is a 3"" Harris.."
"The Nets 3th best player is Joe Harris, who's the Bucks 4th best player? Pat Connoughton, Brook Lopez? And then you callt the Nets top heavy. And the funnier part is the Bucks ""big 3"" isn't even a legitimate big 3"
They don’t even need all 3 to show up. Kevin Durant himself could do it if Joe Harris hadn’t shit the bed so bad.          I feel bad saying this but Bucks aren’t going to be the favorite coming out of the East next year with the Nets superteam still in place.
Because it was literally just Durant. They would have won if joe Harris didn’t shit the bed.
"Nope, I never said superteams are more likely to have injuries. Nor am I suggesting that they're less likely to win the title than other squads.  What I am saying is that injuries are a major factor in whether superteams win the title. The comment you wrote — the one I was responding to — implicitly creates an asterisk for Giannis' title run, as though it was unthinkable that Brooklyn or LA could be derailed by injuries.   That's simply not the case; it turns out having Joe Harris and Kyle Kuzma as your fourth best players puts a lot of pressure on the superstars to be healthy. When you made your prediction seven months ago — and, lest we forget, you confidently stated that ""Giannis gives up a chance to ever win a ring"" by signing the supermax — it probably would've been wise to take into account AD or Kyrie's history of injuries.   You didn't, and you don't get to sneakily draw up an asterisk to save face for a smug and terrible take."
Joe Harris was surprisingly bad. Game 3-7 against Milwaukee he was a net-negative on the court.   His shooting fell off a cliff
Joe Harris will have the chance to improve his stature about as much as anyone on the list. He's going to play in a ton more big games.
Pat Connaughton really outplayed Joe Harris in the playoffs huh
I was so hyped for “the reason why Kyrie chose Brooklyn” Joe Harris to get all these open looks and turn into east coast Klay…he did not turn into east coast klay.
"Harden was on PJ. KD guarded Brook and Middleton, and played every second of the game. Giannis was the one playing help defense because he was guarding Joe Harris."
"in a technical and pedantic sense, yeah. there were literally other players on the team besides KD.   but in the figurative sense (which is all anyone is using), yeah he basically did it alone. putting up massive scoring performances while Kyrie is out, Harden is gigantic and injured, and Joe Harris completely, completely vanishes and KD is literally one toe from winning anyway? yeah that's basically him nearly beating the bucks by himself"
"Oh, but it's fine to give it do Giannis for playing Blake, DJ, Jeff green and Joe Harris?"
"Keep ignoring context buddy. No hate on the Bucks btw. They did their job. But even Giannis said KD is the best. Man was serving 50 pieces to the Bucks with the ghost of Joe Harris, missing Kyrie half the series, the corpse of Blake Griffin, and wheelchair Harden  Oh and after coming back from an Achilles tear on top of that"
"You're a stats guy I get it, but anyone who actually watched the game will tell you differently. Also KD is 32 coming off a torn Achilles the WORST injury in sports, between that and miss a star+multiple key players, and Joe Harris having a mental meltdown in multiple winnable games, everyone knows KD better. I mean Giannis himself said it."
The Nets barely lost with two of their best players injured and a Joe Harris and Harden being a brick factory.
"There’s an unbelievable amount of talk about “KD nearly beat the Bucks with no help” for a guy that didn’t actually win any games without help.   Game one he still had Kyrie, who was good, and Joe Harris’ one fantastic game of the series before he disappeared into the abyss. Game two was a great all-round performance from the Nets while the Bucks (including Giannis) disappeared and it’s the one real stain on Giannis’ performance this series. Game three nobody on the Nets was any good, including KD, and a couple of ok performances from Giannis and Middleton won an ugly game. That was his best chance to actually win without help, even with Kyrie there, and he had a fairly poor game.  Game four he was straight up not good and they lost again, not helped by Kyrie’s injury of course. Game five Jeff Green and Blake Griffin caught absolute fire, it was probably the best game of KD’s career and he deserves all the plaudits he gets for it but if a combined 44 points on 26 shots from those two isn’t help I don’t know what is. Game 6 they got eaten alive on the glass (not KD’s fault) and Middleton was spectacular so they dropped the game.  Then you get to game 7. A toe away from a famous win. He got a little bit of help but not anything especially noteworthy. Brown was good, Blake was good, but they weren’t exactly playing like stars. Thing is, Giannis got exactly the same. Lopez showed up, Connaughton and Tucker hit some threes, but Jrue and Middleton were **bad**. Combined 14/49 from the field bad. They both hit some clutch shots late so it didn’t seem so bad but they were absolute garbage for the majority of the game. There was not a lot of difference between their support casts, which is why it went to OT in the first place despite Giannis being phenomenal.  Seems like people are still judging this series on paper  and ignoring the realities of the series. It wasn’t KD, lone hero against an All Star big three. It was KD and Kyrie for half the series and then for the other half of the series they occasionally had role players stepping up to one degree or another, while two of the Bucks All Star big three struggled to hit a layup for most of the series and the role players were similarly inconsistent and mostly just ok."
"Joe Harris always looked like he had a ""about to be sitting his pants"" look to him."
"that was the moment I started to give bud credit, he somehow manipulated the game and the series into coming down to a joe harris 3 pointer in overtime  after starting off down 0-2, pretty impressive"
Joe Harris
lol I said in the game thread right when we were going to OT that this game was destined to come down to a joe harris 3 pointer  we all knew it.. it was inevitable
"KD played the whole game and was tired af, while Joe Harris had yips"
Imagine if Joe Harris could hit a wide open shot
"You can’t control things like that, I doubt they are feeling salty. If Joe Harris played better hey would have won in spite of all the injuries that’s probably the only real sore spot."
"he'd be totally within his rights if he did so. It wasn't one game, Joe Harris shit the bed 5 games in a row. Absurd"
Also KD: and fk u joe Harris you had 1 job
"I talk for two paragraphs about Klay, write one sentence about Joe Harris, you respond without specifying which and you think I went off about Klay because I'm a homer?  Nice save I guess?  Joe Harris is still better off ball.  So be as upset about it as you want but if you watch a Nets game you'll probably cut your losses with this argument."
"I was responding to the Joe Harris part, we see who is the homer where"
"I don't think so, Kyrie is still a much better scorer than Russ and the Lakers don't have a joe harris"
That has Joe Harris normally shoots in the playoffs
And that was with shitty joe Harris. If joe Harris shoots like himself you just shake there hand and say good game
"You don't lose speed so much with an achilles tear.  Did KD lose speed?  You lose a little bit of lateral movement and you used to lose a lot of explosiveness in your jumping.  The surgery for it that they use now is a lot better and it's less of a penalty on someone's athleticism.  Klay will still be running track meets, and even if he'd lost significant speed he'd still be miles ahead of any other shooting guard.  And Joe Harris is probably better off ball than Beal."
I’m imagining Steph walking down the street dropping dollar bills every second thinking to himself “still making more than Joe Harris”
How are they more complete than the nets ? Joe Harris and Blake griffin are by far the best 4th and 5th guys of any team in the league.
Nets 4th/5th best players are a lot better than the Lakers comparable 4th and 5th. I’d rather have joe Harris and Blake than whoever the Lakers consider their 4th and 5th
"Lmao, just play   Kyrie Harden LeBron KD AD with Russ as a 6th man for 40+ minutes, Joe Harris Blake and Dwight sparingly off the bench"
"50% harden was better than our other options how does that change anything? And if you're gonna say ""if Jeff green didn't go 7/8"" how about we say ""if Joe Harris didn't brick wide open shots end of game 3 and game 7"""
?? Acting like you don’t have Giannis *and* a healthy supporting cast against....  ...Joe Harris?
Joe Harris going to be thrown out the facility like DJ Jazzy Jeff
Do you think you guys will try to get off of Joe Harris now? He was rough in the playoffs and you could probably get decent value for him.
"Yes, maybe him being able to make threes in playoffs will be contagious to Joe Harris"
You mean like Joe Harris in the 2nd round? Lmao.
"No shit they can only afford to get free agents for cheap  now or buyout guys.    I’m talking about the assets they got before kd joined, and the culture they built which made Kd and kyrie join them over the knicks.   The nets developed Dlo, joe Harris, levert and dinwiddie  They drafted jarret Allen and Claxton.   They’ve been way better at finding and developing talent for a while now. Nobody expected them to even make the playoffs in 2019 after what billy king left them with."
Joe Harris needs to shoot like 38% in the playoffs. He was missing wide open shots against the Bucks.
Just look at Joe Harris shooting 47.5% from three on this team lol
Joe Harris isn't all that in the playoffs don't worry
"it's better to have a good 3pt % in the reg season than not, but we've seen guys like joe harris shrink come playoff time due to the fact they just dont get the same shots they get in reg season so these %s do not predict their playoff ability.  it's better to find guys who can take difficult 3s or contribute otherwise."
joe harris wasn’t very useful this year
"Not bad for the minimum. Should get some decent playing time at Center behind Embiid, Bassey, Simmons, Harris, Thybulle, Korkmaz, Maxey, Curry, Tucker, Milton, Joe, Reed, Springer"
no team can survive 2 out of their best 3 players getting hurt. the fact that the nets literally almost beat the champs with that shows they actually did have good depth. blake/green/bruce were all pretty good. like u say if joe harris stepped up even a little that series is over.
"If Joe Harris hits an open 3 in overtime we're not having this conversation. Nets have decent depth, they just didn't show up."
Funny how everybody mentiones how bad joe harris was but forget to mention james harden was shooting even worse in that series
"He’s getting paid 20 a year, it’s not even close to the max so I don’t consider it spending big.   If you have Joe Harris earning 4/75, Robinson on 5/90, Bertans 5/80 and Kennard on 4/64 who are all older than Allen and only do 1 thing good then I am more than happy with 5/100 lol."
"Davis Bertans, Joe Harris... If you can shoot you're getting paid.  This ain't a charity."
"If the Lakers signed Joe Harris, he would shoot like he did against the Bucks for the entire season..."
"People have forgotten just how bad Robinson's stat-line was for the final three games of the Bucks series.  Robinson was 7-13 from 3 for 24 points in Game 1 but went 3-14 (21.4%) from 3 in the last 3 games of the series, including 1-8 in games 3 and 4.   Joe Harris was 5-9 from 3 in Game 1 for 19 points against the Bucks but then went 11-40 (27.5%) from 3 over the rest of the series.   Obviously Robinson's game 1 was more impressive and his cold streak was a few games shorter, but their overall playoff performances against the Bucks were actually remarkably similar. I think it's fair to say they both choked."
"He’s a good offball guy, like Joe Harris who knows WHEN to shoot inside which is a very underrated skill."
Y’all already have the better team lol  Joe Harris is way better than anyone the lakers can get
"He had a great 2020 finals. Bertie and Joe Harris all got about the same, Bertie a little less and Harris a little more. That's just the going rate"
18mil a year for the best shooter not in gs is not an overpay lmao. less than joe harris
Joe Harris is much better then him though.
this is the going rate now see joe harris - not something they wanna do but they need the space
Joe Harris and Bertans make way more. Totally fair contract
Those are Joe Harris numbers
I hope he doesn’t pull a Joe Harris in the big stage
That’s not Joe Harris money
Bertans been shooting bricks. Joe Harris absolutely choked in the playoffs.  Better hope Duncan doesn't follow suit lol
You said best by far. I don't agree with that. He was very very good. Best by far is a stretch.   Joe Harris shot over 50% pre All Star break...
"If they get dimwiddie back I’m not sure they can be beat.  This dude almost took the nets to playoffs a few years back when it was just him, Jarrett Allen, levert, and joe Harris.  I can’t imaging him coming off the bench!"
"Each off season the teams go into a competitive process to sign talent based on:  1. What they need talent-wise  2. What talent is available via trading and free agency  3. How much cap space they have, to see whether they can afford the player(s)  It is a supply/demand scenario.  If this season Miami needs a quality shooting guard, and there are 3 free agent quality shooting guards available, then we're in a situation where supply of shooting guards might be greater than the demand. This will result in Miami being able to be more picky and drive a hard bargain to get a low price for their needs. In this scenario those players are arguably ""underpaid"".  Conversely, if there are 3 teams competing for a single quality SG, then those teams are bidding against each other and it's going to raise the value of the contract.  Knowing that there was a ""better"" SG that signed the previous year for a lower contract, that doesn't affect the equation this year. That comes down to who is available NOW and who is competing for that contract.  If I recall, there weren't many top SGs available when Joe Harris signed, so he probably got overpaid. It might be the same for Duncan this year.  If Oladipo didn't reinjure himself, and he's available this year then Duncan probably gets a lower contract as there is now more supply for the demand of SG's   Last year's contracts are not in play if those players aren't getting traded."
"Yeah, but did he do it with Joe Harris?"
What did Joe Harris do to be that bad in your opinion
You could make the same argument with Giannis's run then surely. After all the toughest matchup they had was in the second round and they unequivocally would have lost if not for those injuries and Joe Harris forgetting how to shoot. At the end of the day you beat whoever is put in front of you.
"Seth Curry is not on a 20M contract, 7.2M so not sure why you would include him, no shit he lived up to that.   Joe Harris shot what, 30% against the Bucks? Didn't exactly help the Nets win.   Plenty of people think Hield is overpaid. Hield is going to get moved because he isn't good enough for that price tag to win, he has never played in a high leverage NBA game in his life so we don't know how he'll look in the playoffs. Maybe he can win on a team with 2 other superstars making that much money but that's about it.   Bertans, another overpaid shooter that disappears when you need him."
He shot .396 on over 7 attempts. He may not be “elite” if you wanna designate that for the very few sharpshooters like Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson. But he’s much better than “good.”
"if hield can’t hit his shots in the playoffs like Joe Harris, what use does he have? if westbrook can score he can still assist like crazy"
"Considering they will be paying Durant, Harden, and Irving ~$120M alone next season, no shit you are tied to the luxury tax.   That alone puts them over the cap.   Throw in Joe Harris and they are over the tax line for 4 players."
"Yep. If guys like Duncan and Joe Harris are getting 18 a year, I don’t think it’s actually that outlandish for Fournier to ask Boston for 20 a year. And the more I think about it, I think they should pay him. He’s a good player, it’s unlikely he becomes a negative asset in one season, they can always trade him if they need salary cap space"
Can’t believe Joe Harris and Bertans makes more than OG  He should fire his agent
"I mean, he's a great ball handler, shooter and defender. You are acting like that isn't valuable in the league today.  Also, people like Joe Harris being exclusively shooters are getting $18M"
"Duncan is a great finisher and a much better defender than Bertans, his comparison is much more Joe Harris tham Bertans, and that's a good deal"
"Consider what Bertans and Joe Harris got, 18 m isn't that crazy"
"The Nets actually can do a S&amp;T, provided they lower their payroll and end the transaction below the apron.   Let’s say Kawhi is signed to a $38m AAV contract.   Joe Harris + Dinwiddie (signed anywhere beneath $20m AAV) + DeAndre Jordan meets this criteria.  So theoretically, yes this is possible."
"No, not at all since Dinwiddie would be traded alongside Joe Harris.   If we say Kawhi is signed to a $38m AAV contract, Brooklyn would only need to send ~$31m back.   Joe Harris makes $17m, so signing Dinwiddie to 3/42m gets the job done.   Only problem would be that Brooklyn is at the Apron, preventing them from making this happen. However if the agreement was made the Nets would move heaven and earth to clear cap."
Dudes only 23 and has shown plenty of flashes that he can be a productive nba player and even shot 40% from 3 this season in limited run. Sounds like what he really needs is an organization with good stability and leadership to steer him on a path that won’t let his drug problems ruin his career. 4 years 52 million isn’t that crazy considering what we saw Joe Harris get and he’s just a spot up shooter
"He's not a shooter in the same sense that Joe Harris is, again your point is insane."
"Joe Harris and Lonzo Ball are not defended the same, this comparison is insane."
"Honestly I feel like they would be a more well rounded team rather than a team that has a sole superstar. But I do see a lot of offensive star potential in Poole, Moody (with some tweaking to his shot selection). I see Kuminga and Wiseman as players who will thrive as defensive players kind of like draymond. Poole and wiseman have some good pick an roll potential. Not to mention our sharpshooter in Jessup who can probably be like a joe harris with better defense. and with nico and eric paschall coming off the bench we would be a pretty well rounded team that can win a championship. Plus we can add more to our needs through free agency."
So is Joe Harris… not a shooter?
Watching Joe Harris in the Bucks series made me sad
"That's not how expected value works. On average, a Joe Harris 3-point attempt produced 47.5% x 3 = 1.425 points, while 3 Joe Harris free throw attempts produced 77.8% x 3 = 2.334 points. You're discarding the possibilities where Joe Harris makes 2 or 1 of the 3 free throws."
Attempts matter. He attempted more than most of his era while facing double teams and being the only offensive threat. That's why I think most people here would take Steph Curry on a must make 3 over Joe Harris. Who shot 5 percent better on half the attempts this season.
"what protests outside the hotel? who thought they would be detained? source?  Joe Harris was the only one to say anything   &gt; “I know a lot of the stuff has been blown out of proportion, but I don’t think guys felt uncomfortable or unsafe,” Harris said. “We were there playing preseason games. Joe had a lot of stuff planned. We had great dinners. The team bonding. There was a lot of good opportunities to hang out. We weren’t caught up with a lot of the stuff going on.”"
Kyrie and Harden had legit excuses.  Joe Harris on the other hand..
"Why, let him play the perimeter on offence and stick him on the corner shooter on defence. He’s never going to be good on defence but he can bother whatever Joe Harris/Even Fournier/Jae Crowder guy better than he can defend against 6’10+ guys."
you probably right. Giannis never had to guard KD during that series so his rating would of course be higher. KD guarded everyone. giannis out by the 3 pt line guarding joe harris
Not after that postseason.  Bucks only won the title because joe Harris shot like Antoine walker.
Buddy has been the second option for the kings for the past few seasons and has been putting up good numbers. Joe Harris folded as the second option for Nets this post season
Joe Harris
Charmander: Tyler Herro  Charmeleon: Joe Harris  Charizard: Klay Thompson
Klay  Duncan Robinson  Joe Harris
- Joe Harris  - Buddy Hield  - Klay Thompson
Bradley Beal  Joe Harris  Bryn Forbes
He’s looking like Joe Harris out there
I mean I would rather have ray Allen than Joe Harris lol wtf is this take
"Probably not, with the gravity of kd and kyrie. He’s probably gonna get 10 assists a game off joe Harris and whichever center is in the game with him"
"A white player who wasn’t cancelled? Tf? Zubac, Jokic, Caruso, Joe Harris, Gallo, Theis, and almost every other"
Joe Harris &gt; Wilt and anyone saying otherwise has a stick up their ass
"That’s the price you pay when you build your team around 3 mvps/all star caliber players. When one goes down the role players are forced to do things they normally wouldn’t. Joe Harris missed several open 3s including one in OT of game 7 that could have ended up winning y’all the game.   I don’t really care and neither do any bucks fans on what Nets fans have to say, we won and we know would have lost if y’all were healthy, healthy superteams are meant to beat everyone. That’s why they exist."
They wouldn't play like ass if Kyrie was there and even less so if Harden was there. They were asked to do more than they are capable of. Joe Harris is the perfect example. He was game planned for since he was the only other offensive threat besides Durant. If he had healthy Harden and/or Kyrie then it's harder to pay attention to him when you have way more imminent threats.  But I'm sure this will not resonate well with Bucks fans because it goes against the narrative and it's coming from a fan of the very team you would've lost to.
"Why would that be a brilliant move? That's fucking idiotic. There is no reason not to double when Kyrie is out, Harden is hobbled, and Joe Harris is bricking shots."
"you can go right ahead but I don't think anyone will find them as interesting or remarkable. the nets were missing 2 of their stars, that series shouldn't have gone to 7 at all. Brooklyn should've been failing, so their moments of weakness don't really surprise anyone or seem worth talking about. oh, Joe Harris disappeared? gasp."
"The bucks had a historically bad 3 point shooting % drop from regular season to playoffs, but you wanna focus on joe harris chucking up bricks as an excuse for the nets?"
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
Joe Harris had a WIDE open 3 to put the nets up three with a few seconds left and clanked it lol. That guy is never gonna be a playoff performer. He was bad in the playoffs even when he had a lesser role on the Cavs.
Who is the best white American currently? I feel like Love had that mantle for a long time but it's clearly not him anymore.  Hayward? Joe Harris? Duncan Robinson?  Not a lot of depth.
"If you choose to close out on someone you’re not supposed to then yes it’s gonna break down. Doubling can lead to scrambling but you don’t need to close out on every single guy open on the perimeter. You recognize the 3pt threats and stay on them.   Also In case you weren’t watching, Joe Harris found himself open plenty of times without any doubling and bricked the majority of them  But yeah don’t double the guy giving you 40 a night because you don’t want Blake griffin or Jeff green taking open 3’s lmao. They LITERALLY almost lost the series because they didn’t double. If they doubled kd wouldn’t have been able to turn and fade like that"
You're delusional if you think Joe Harris won't get more open looks if KD is being double teamed.  Double-teams create breakdowns all over the court and they're quite easy to exploit.
Joe Harris is not arguably the 3rd best shooter behind curry/Klay. Especially not after that choke job in the semis.
"If Joe Harris gets into a shooting rhythm because he's wide open off of KD doubles, Nets win the series. Blake Griffin could also feast off of the additional openings. He's still very good when healthy, and he was perfectly healthy. And KD wouldn't have been significantly slowed down by a double, he'd still get his. You're flat out wrong."
"Blake is the bigger name so they probably name him as the starter  Who closes games will matter more though, I guess depending on the matchup given the Nets can choose who closes alongside their big 3 + Joe Harris"
"&gt;They have Joe Harris who’s arguably the 3rd best shooter behind Klay and Curry     Bruh"
"they opened up a shitload of cap in 2019 and got Kyrie and KD (and deandre jordan who hitched a ride onto his talented friends). they had bird rights on Joe Harris and Brown. blake wants a free ring and signed for minimum wage. patty wants a free ring and signed for the MLE which every single team gets. they traded levert, allen, taurean prince, and 3 first rounders with 4 swaps for harden. their tax bill will be 200+ million soon but the owner can afford it"
Joe Harris
Bird rights joe harris and the rest are mid level/minimum
"So you're just gonna ignore these lucky coincidence as well:  &gt; KD foot 1 inch over the line   &gt;   &gt;Joe Harris shooting 25% from 3s in that last 3 games  Also, Steve Kerr had no problem wrapping up Lebron and scrubs in 2 games (by 8+ differential in each game) in 2015 finals after it was 2-2 and despite Lebron going insane in the last 2 games.  And no, 2015 Warriors was not peak Warriors that we know of in 2016."
"&gt;The argument that he only won due to injury luck is ridiculous because no coach would have beaten the Nets had they been healthy.   It's more on the fact that with 3 games remaining in that series and KD was the only star left in Nets, it took him the whole 3 games and KD foot 1 inch over the line to win the series.  Not to mention the luck of Joe Harris shooting 25% from 3s in that last 3 games"
"They're not any more 'top heavy' than you guys are.   They actually have an equal/better supporting cast based on how well they were playing until 2 of their 3 stars went down (and even after). Blake, Jeff Green, Bruce Brown, Joe Harris &amp; company &gt;&gt; old Lopez, Portis.  The Nets bench was up 50 pts on yall in Game 2 as Blake was outplayin Giannis, lmaoo. They just lost on a game winner as they were put in a historically impossible positions.  If the Bucks top-heavy roster had their stars get injured, they would get swept, so your point is moot."
KD probably lowkey wanna kill Joe Harris after seeing that mf shoot 32% from 3 vs the Bucks &amp; 46% TS
They also got incredibly lucky Joe Harris choked a bunch of wide open 3s
I still remember the Joe Harris wide open three in OT. They were up 2 and there was like 2 minutes left. Even though he had played like dogshit all series my heart still skipped a beat.   Then he clanked it
"Didn’t the nets start Kyrie, Joe Harris and Harden this year?"
"Whatever the fuck Joe Harris did against the Bucks. People talk about KD’s foot over the line, but Joe Harris had a disgustingly ice cold series with WIDE OPEN bricks in big moments."
Playoff Joe Harris
He had a long career as a role player. From his time on the Lakers to many good teams in beteeen. You’ll see there aren’t many stars who shoot from the corners so it makes sense that it would be a good role player that had a long career. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a guy like joe Harris or Duncan Robinson eventually take over the spot.
Round 2 Joe harris
JJ is better than Joe Harris.
"He might be waiting 2-3 months to see if anyone gets injured on a contender. If Joe Harris or Patty Mills have any injury issues, Brooklyn may be willing to sign JJ just for some depth at that point"
"Joe Harris very possibly cost us a ring this year.  I can excuse one horrible playoff series, but he did the same thing in 2019. Two garbage series with multiple performances that were among his worst all season.  Sorry to say, but he is a bonafide choke artist."
"With Joe Harris having an all time choke job when it mattered, JJ wouldn’t hurt   But Patty is there now a oo"
"And they already have joe harris, they don't need reddick at all"
"ok this makes more sense to me. chuck hayes, reggie evans, ok. but joe harris and kelly oubre? also alonzo gee did enough of anything to get a highly ranked stat! i get that it was a bad stat, but still."
Bagley playing as well as Luka or Trae Young  Fox elevating to that next tier of superstar  Haliburton improving to a legit full time starter (not that hes not close already)   This would give you elite roleplayers in Hali/Holmes/Hield/Barnes.  This would pretty closely mimic Blake/Claxton/Bruce Brown/Joe Harris.    Bagley/Fox would give you your Harden/Durant type stack.
This is the one. Joe Harris was the best player for the Nets. Joe Harris. Then he had to leave the bubble for personal reasons and the team got EVEN WORSE.  Whole series was a waste of time.
"Who are the 2 starters under 30? Joe Harris turns 30 September something and Kyrie will be 30 in March, and he’s already injury prone so counting him as one of the young guys doesn’t bode well. KD, Harden, Blake, DJ and Patty Mills are all over 30. I guess maybe you’re thinking they start Claxton?"
Joe Harris is not better than Kyrie.  They needed Joe Harris to be something he wasn’t all season….
"Percent of 2P FGAs blocked (since 2000, min. 1000 2P FGA):  1. Reggie Evans, 17.7% 2. Omer Asik, 17.1% 3. Joe Harris, 14.4% 4. Joel Pryzbilla, 14.3% 5. Alonzo Gee, 13.9% 6. Kelly Oubre, 13.4% 7. Chuck Hayes, 13.4% 8. Bojan Bogdanovich, 13.3% 9. Bismack Biyombo, 13.3% 10. Elfrid Payton, 13.2%"
More like they needed Joe Harris not to suck.
"You're forgetting Durant averaged 35/10/5/1/1 with his 2nd best player being either Jeff green, pirate harden or a Joe Harris that just forgot how to shoot against the eventual champs. Kawhi is excellent and a top 10 current player but Durant is probably top 25 all time which Kawhi can't touch"
"According to the box score, Joe Harris shot 3/10 that game which honestly shocked me because watching that game it looked like he missed every single shot despite being wide open on damn near every one of them."
"Yeah basically. It's EXTREMELY impressive that he took them as far as he did with basically no help. Harden on one leg, Joe Harris being a no show. Yet my whole twitter timeline was people making fun of KD and calling him a choker for airballing the final shot. Ridiculous."
Nah - the pure shot making KD pulled off in those 2 games was ridiculous and I haven't seen anything like it with those stakes. Lebron doesn't suddenly turn Joe Harris into a capable shooter.
"I mean run the offense through KD and Harden, Joe Harris your knockdown shooter to space the floor, get a top tier 3/D wing and stretch five in there and you're golden, right? Kyrie can get you at least that no?"
Joe Harris forgot how to shoot and Harden was on one leg. They can also play much better
"Nets are so far over the cap that Kyrie, Joe Harris, Patty Mills and Bruce Brown could all be vaporized by a Martian space laser tomorrow and they still wouldn't have any room to sign anybody above the minimum."
"That depends on if something is different this year, but if it goes like last series, just having a healthy harden would mean they beat the Bucks easily   Just remember that KD was an inch from winning it himself. That’s with Harden not being able to bend his legs and Joe Harris having one of the biggest meltdowns of the last few years"
"I'm sure he'll be fine when he's coaching KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Blake, Paul Millsap and Joe Harris"
Nets go up 3-0 in the Finals and force feed Joe Harris in game 4
"Not really met so much as walked by them. Me and a few buddies went to a nets @ pelicans game a year or so ago. After the game we decided to go have a little fun at Harrahs Casino when we drunkenly stumbled upon DeAndre Jordan, Joe Harris, and one more player that I can’t recall.  There wasn’t much of an entourage around them so they were pretty low key.  The only reason we realized who they were is because it’s pretty hard to miss DeAndre walking around in a duster."
"""Are you not entertained?""  - James Johnson, Patty Mills and Joe Harris, probably."
I probably would not notice he’s Joe Harris w/o his headband.
Brooklyn has great shooters no doubt but they aren't littered with them as people might think.  Kyrie helps make them a disgusting shooting team.  Without him they have 4 shooters you trust and one of them is Joe Harris who bricked everything in the Bucks series and the other is James Harden who doesn't take spot up jump shots.
10 assists a night to KD and Joe Harris lol
man what?  KD's foot on the line with a one legged Harden and Joe Harris not being able to hit the side the broad side of a barn was almost enough to beat the bucks
WHO THE HECK PASSES TO KD WHEN YOU HAVE JOE HARRIS ON THE TEAM?
"It's makes sense since the rest can all space with 3s. I think Ben's stock is at an all time low and would never want him on my team, however he would be a fit with the nets.  Starting five:  PG - Ben Simmons SG - Harden SF - Joe Harris PF - KD C - Blake/Aldridge"
Teams would just dare Ben Simmons to beat them because Brooklyn doesn’t have a reliable enough stretch five with Jeff Green gone.  It’s either Ben Simmons beat us or Blake/LMA/Paul Millsap beat us with jumpers.  With Kyrie you don’t have that luxury especially if Joe Harris plays like he did in the Milwaukee.
"Eh. I don’t think anyone is going to bombard someone like Joe Harris or Terry Rozier. Most players can probably still do everyday things without too many people noticing. Probably a couple pictures and autographs here and there. But no crowds. Crowds and chaos happens when you get the stars like Lebron, Steph, KD, and those guys."
Man Joe Harris is lucky. Pretty sure he'll never deal with this problem
Sources tell me Joe Harris will be the most important voice in the meeting.
Weren't you guys one inch away from losing to a Nets team with a hobbling Harden and a Joe Harris that shot worse than Simmons?
trade Blake back to the Clippers for Ibaka and Joe Harris to ESPN for Kendrick Perkins
"Duncan Robinson as mentioned, picture perfect. Buddy Hield, Furkan, Joe Harris"
"3 team trade sending Simmons to Brooklyn, Kyrie and picks to OKC (he would retire), Joe Harris to Philly."
"KD+Harden is easily the best duo in the league (Can make an argument for top 5 for both of them).   Then on top of that, even an out-of-prime Blake Griffin, Aldridge, Milsap helps round out the PF (or small ball C) C position.  None of these guys can give you 40 minute of elite ball but each of them can give you about 10-15 minutes of solid ball at this stage.  Then at the guard spot you still have Patty Mills+Joe Harris who are both great shooters and both could probably start on a lot of teams.  Then at the C position you have Claxton who isn't ideal but he's still been really good and starter-caliber. He isn't really a weakness since they will play a lot of small ball and they don't really need him to do much other than set screens, get rebounds, and play average-level defense.  Then ass an insurance policy they have Bruce Bowen who looked really legit last year. They also have Cam Thomas who I think has potential to have a Jamal Crawford or Lou Williams-type career as a pure scorer (but his opportunity might not be in Brooklyn due to being back on depth chart).  James Johnson is also an x-factor. He has been ass on bad teams but on good teams, when he doesn't need to do much, he has a tendency to do a lot of important things that don't show up on the stat sheet or at the very least be an enforcer on the team to give it grit&amp;grind.  Bembry is also a great player to have on the team even if he will barely play due to the culture, effort, and intangibles he brings to the team at practices, warmups and so on (Go watch Open gym and other videos on him - Raptors staff loved him because of how smart he was and how he was able to be used to practice schemes against opponents and give the younger guys some run).  This team is elite without Kyrie. Without Kyrie, I think a healthy Nets team is still the best in the East. With Kyrie, a healthy Nets team is a guaranteed chip. Health + Kyrie will be the x-factor for this team."
"LMA and Blake are two huge names, they will definitely drive some amount of ticket sales given the transitory nature of NY's population. A **ton** of people in NY have previously lived in LA/Detroit/Portland/San Antonio and were fans of them in the past.  Obviously they aren't driving the same amount of sales as they used to, but they are going to drive some. Certainly more than someone like Joe Harris who is a better player than either of them. I really don't understand why they left the comment. To me, it just seems like they want to argue about something."
"I just don’t love how those guys fit with talents like KD or Harden. I would surround those two with pure defense, heart, and spacing. I think millsap is a good fit, I like Joe Harris, but none of those other guys impress me too much as sidekicks to KD and Harden. Claxton can be great alongside them but I think he’s a year or two away from being reliable in the playoffs."
"Don’t have many??? Joe Harris, Brown, Mills, Clax, Blake griffin, Aldridge, millsap that’s just off the top of my head"
"Durant, Harden, Patty Mills, Joe Harris, Aldridge, Millsap, Griffin, plus a few other bench guys? I'd pick them in a heartbeat"
Jordan Nwora. Looks like Milwaukee's Joe Harris. Sharpshooting with bleh defense
"I don't think there is any chance of that trade happening (or Kyrie being traded as all). But totally agree that Simmons would fit fine. He could also set picks and role to the rim for lobs and could play PF with LMA at Center because of LMA's shooting. He would improve the Nets defense and with KD, Harden, Patty Mills, Joe Harris, and LMA on the team, the offense is still going to get 120 a game."

joe harris making preseason shots. his best time of year.
Jordan Poole is what Joe Harris is getting paid to be.
"To be fair Harden had to face KD, Steph, Draymond, and Klay  Giannis had to face KD, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, and Bruce Brown"
"Shades of that awesome Larry Nance dunk from a while back. Respect to Joe Harris for the contest though, not someone you'd expect to go up and protect the rim lol"
Where was this Joe Harris in the playoffs ?
I think they're referring to Joe Harris' disappearing act in the playoffs
&gt; He must retire and Nets should be able to use that Salary on someone else.  That’s not how the cap works. If he retires they can only replace him with minimum level deals or by trading a guy like Joe Harris for one.
"How is a ring playing with Durant, Harden and Joe Harris difficult?"
If you fuse them together they become Joe Harris?
But there already are 50 percent shooters like joe harris and until recently Kyle korver
"KD, Harden, Griffin, Aldridge, Millsap, Patty Mills, Joe Harris. I'm really praying for them to get through these tough times."
"you could use that same argument for Joe Harris, shooters will always have bad series but that’s why the stars are there, to keep everything flowing"
"Idk why people keep asking this question, you all know well by now. He almost single handedly beat the eventual champions, that is the answer. They were a three pointer away, whether it’s KDs foot or Joe Harris showing up."
if Joe Harris shoots half as well in the post-season as season they go to the Finals. He had 5 bad shooting nights in 12 games. He has a couple less I don't see MIL beating them.
"Joe Ingles Jalen Brunson CJ McCollum Poetl   Brogdon is a really good player, but he’s more a Tobias Harris than anything: Really good player who isn’t near elite"
Joe Harris of the Heat
Yeah this was my biggest fear after watching Bertans and then Joe Harris playoffs performance   Miami should’ve offered a lower and shorter contract and if another team offered a bigger contract then they should’ve just let him walk
"Out of the shooters getting paid, Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson is shitting their bed this season while VanVleet is consistently high scoring"
"I'll take Prime Magic. You can still \*somewhat\* replicate what Steph does by surrounding Magic with 3-4 other shooters (Seth Curry, Joe Harris, JJ Reddick types; obviously none are as good as Steph). You cannot however, replicate Magic's playmaking and bb IQ."
Is JJ one of those guys who says Joe Harris is more efficient than Curry?
"Definitely not.   Steph, Klay, Dame, KD, Harden, Hield, Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, KAT, PG are all easily better than him."
"Like I said, you're pointing out a correlation.   Okay we can look at the more average joe. Shane Larkin had a wingspan of 5'10, mediocre if not bad shooter.   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.   Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.   Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.   Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.   Wilt despite having Gobert level wingspan and shooting terribly from free throws, had actual reputation for being an elite perimeter player at the time. KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan.   I'm not really seeing a pattern here."
Could be worse. Could be Joe Harris in the playoffs
Joe Harris sucked in tough playoff series before. He has yet to prove he can actually play in a high pressure situation.
And bribe Joe Harris before the series lol
"Lol. Allen maybe. Everyone else is a career backup. Joe Harris can shoot but plays some of the worst defense in the league. Ed Davis? I mean, then I can easily list 15-20 better T-Wolves in KAT’s career than Ed Davis. That is a team of backups and role players (minus Allen, but he was also really young at this time).   Ant and KAT are better than all those guys except for maybe Allen, so why this team can’t sniff winning 50% of their games is crazy. Like, they aren’t even close and there are at least 8-10 teams that have worse talent than them."
&gt;D-Lo lead the Nets to an eastern conference playoff bud a few years ago with nothing else around him  Go look at that team again bud.   Levert. Dinwiddie. Allen. Joe Harris. Carroll. Ed Davis. Those were or are all legit players on that team.   Now compare those guys to what Towns has had outside the Butler year.
"how would you feel about something like Joe Harris, Claxton and Cam Thomas?"
"no need to be salty, but I said you're saying no to *everyone* and *everything*, not just your ""MT &gt; 3 joe harris"" take.  adding nothing, stick to your own sub if that's your only take. later"
So would you like a detailed analysis of why I don't want Joe Harris for Myles Turner? Lmao. All I'm saying.
"Could make a pretty great team from the inactive list for this game  MIL: Donte DiVincenzo, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Sandro Mamukelashvili  PHI: Grant Riller, Isaiah Joe, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons"
Nah I don’t think you are but when I’ve mentioned “Turner for Joe Harris + stuff” to Nets fans online and irl they all seem to collectively vomit at the thought lol
Would y’all do Joe Harris for Turner straight up? I could see either side of the argument but I’d definitely personally lean toward yes
"Plus we’re missing Embiid, Harris, Simmons, Thybulle, Isaiah Joe, and now Seth has a foot injury that kept him out tonight. It’s a weird time right now."
Not 3rd option   Joe Harris or LMA aren't better than Jrue as overall players
"Joe ""Joe Harris"" Harris is good at basketball"
Joe Harris needs to commit to the headband lifestyle and never take it off.
"Sixers starters played horribly, turnovers led to 35 Nets points, and Joe Harris shot lights out. There’s that game summed up.  We never play well on back to backs"
Jarrett Allen is making that leap and Joe Harris is dangerous
Lol did Joe Harris just say vroom as he was driving the lane?
Joe Harris you beautiful man
Just want to say I love Joe Harris. Hope he's a Net4Life.
"They're idiots.  Tony Bennet is one of best scouting coaches in CBB in terms of id'ing talent others overlook and he said Hunter had not even scratched the surface of his potential when he was drafted.  Reminder he recruited Klay Thompson, Joe Harris and Malcolm Brogdon."
Joe Harris with the casual 25 pts off the bench
Joe Harris really doesn't want to lose this game. Big performance tonight.
Joe “OvErPaY” Harris!!!
Its because theyre playing against this awful nets lineup.   Without joe harris 10-0 run in first half they would be -20 in 15 min
Joe Harris looks like he uses LSD regularly. Guy would fit right into that weird Scandinavian cult in Midsommar.
That's why Joe Harris got paid the big Bucks.
Joe Harris a couple more 3s until a n word pass
Joe Harris   #nice
"I’ve seen enough, give Joe Harris the MVP"
Whoa do you think Tobias Harris and Joe Harris are related?
Joe Harris needs to shorten those shorts brother
"Chris Webber definitely wanted to say ""don't let him fool you cause he's white"" when he was trying to compliment Joe Harris lmao"
Every LA Fitness has a guy that looks and plays exactly like Joe Harris
"Joe Harris, one man wrecking crew"
"Ian Eagle just said Joe Harris has 69 straight games with a 3...so sad Richard Jefferson had to inexplicably cancel commentating tonight.  We lost out on a ""*nice*""."
Joe Harris MVP SZN????
These jerseys really accentuate Joe Harris’ grit and gym work ethic
Is Joe Harris doing some guerilla marketing for a Tropic Thunder sequel? If so I'm all in
I see Doc has countered with our own rec league white guy to try and go against Joe Harris.
Did Joe Harris just outrebound Dwight Howard
Joe Harris lookin like one of the milkmen MJ used to play against
“joe Harris looks like a member of average joes”  Ian eagle with no chill lmaooo
Joe Harris somehow looks more and more like a try hard rec league dude every time I watch a Nets game.
"that ""all-defense"" team is pretty fuckin elite on offense  and Joe Harris? deadass? at least put Ray Allen in"
"Offense. Wallace's defense won't matter as much as Jokic doesn't need to score to have a great impact.   Also why the fuck is Joe Harris on the all-Offense team lmao. ""Here's 4 of the best defenders ever plus a current player who is one of the best defenders in the league. And then for offense, here's elite offensive players plus Joe Harris"""
"All these all time greats, and then there is Joe Harris"
Bojan Bogdanovic  OG Anunoby   DeMar DeRozan  Kyle Kuzma   Mikal Bridges   Caris LeVert  Joe Harris
Joe Harris is unironically a better player for the nets than Kyrie
obviously joe harris
Fuck KD and Fuck The Nets. Not you Joe Harris you are cool
"Jeff green did, joe Harris had an above average night. You’re talking like it was an aberration from a bench guy"
"Joe Harris is much better than people think, he’s an elite shooter"
"KD does not love to dribble, not sure where this narrative came from. He might take a dribble or two then pull up, but in no way is KD the kind of player that is going to dribble for 14 seconds before trying to make a play. Also Harden may dribble a lot but he's also an incredible passer. Only unknown is Kyrie.   Last point, Joe Harris plays just like Klay other than being less talented defensively. If Harris isn't as good of a 3 point shooter as Klay is then he's definitely close and Harris definitely can definitely play off ball.  Harris is shooting 51% from 3 on 6 attempts a game and most of that is without Harden who happens to be one of the best in the NBA at attracting help defenders and finding the open man."
joe harris gotten so much better at slashing and finishing around the bucket. People who only sees him as a 3 guy is disrespectful.
What concerns me is that when Kyrie is their the Bucks don't have 3 guys to guard the Nets best dudes and still be able to execute their defensive schemes  Say you have Jrue on Kyrie or Harden and Middleton on Harden or KD.  That means Giannis has to guard one of LD or Harden which isn't his best defensive skill set.  He's an all time great help defender but only average on ball.  Plus you don't want him getting tired from defending those guys with his play style.  So does he guard Joe Harris and chase him around screens?  Milwaukee needs to address that issue first and foremost because Giannis on KD or Harden is a bad idea.  It's why Brooklyn should make the finals.
"Miami will get better as the season goes, they're just hungover fro the finals. Joe harris will probably get guarded by Duncan... and then you just pray for tyler hero guarding kyrie."
"Bucks:  PG: Jrue / Augustin  SG: DiVincenzo / Forbes  SF: Middleton / Connaughton   PF: Giannis / Torrey Craig  C: Lopez / Portis   Nets:  PG: Kyrie / Bruce Brown  SG: Harden / Shamet  SF: Joe Harris / TLC  PF: KD / Jeff Green  C: DAJ / Claxton   Am I the only one who doesn't think that their benches are that terrible? I think both teams are in desperate need of a proper backup center, but if you wanted to reduce each team down to an 8-man rotation you could do that with ease.   I will admit though that I am kinda worried about the Bucks bench guys on the defense end; Augustin is a solid backup floor general but is undersized. Forbes and Portis have been known to be black holes on defense.  I get what you're saying about the weaknesses in both of their rotations but I'm decently high on the guys. Obviously the talent is top heavy but they aren't scrubs by any means."
"Yeah I’m just messing around lol. We have 3 elite 3-level scorers, who also happen to be 3 of the best ISO players in the entire league. Then add in Joe Harris who’s just one of the best shooters in the league. We’ll see how it works, but potentially it’s the deadliest offense ever."
"Listen man. If you can't learn how to shoot with Joe Harris, KD, and Steve Nash in practice and available to you lol"
"You could see he was actually a bit shaken up on those Harden\Harris pick and rolls where they fucking doubled Harden and didn't rotate to him. Harden passed RIGHT AWAY, but Joe was still shook that they've actually left him all alone for a straight on 3."
Yes his name is Joe Harris
Joe Harris: 67% TS  The NBA is finally catching on to the fact that he’s not just a three point shooter. Very good finisher and has added a mid-range shot as well.
Both solid points honestly. Jeff green and Joe Harris did shoot out of there minds though.
Nobody is able to create their shots except Harden or KD. If you are actually good though like Jeff Green or Joe Harris people will actively look for you to hold the rock because they trust you to improvise. The other players need to stick to roles or else offense will be a mess.
"Indeed, Klay Thompson is a glorified Joe Harris."
"&gt; He scores about the same but Harden racks up assists and rebounds plus really works to get the team involved.  i know kyrie's a mess, but he's a good player and i think you're overthinking this.   think of it like steph-dray-klay, and the nets have kd-harden-kyrie. it doesn't apply on the defensive end obviously, but offensively, harden is playing a draymond who can score from anywhere, and who has a klay and a steph to pass to. and now both perimeter shooters in kd and kyrie have a viable option to pass back to at the top of the key who can reliably shoot a 3 OR drive for a layup or a pass back out to the perimeter - where you might also have joe harris.  i honestly think this is fine (for you) and shit (for everyone else)"
Joe Harris - 70% TS
Chris Webber said Joe Harris plays like Steph Curry???
He gets to be guarded by whoever guarded Joe Harris today.   And Harris got an easy 20 today.
surely you give harden a look at two and a potential and one rather than letting joe fucking harris shoot uncontested threes?
Joe Harris who lead the league in 3pt % last year and won the 3pt contest.
because james harden is the guy who then gets a one on one with a weaker defender. They did start switching it in the second half and harden went to the rim for easy buckets. I agree tho its the better strategy you cant just let joe harris bomb threes he will hit those at 50% if hes wide open.
"Lebron, Luka, Giannis, Joe Harris.  Four all-time great players showing us how hard free throws really are."
And Joe Harris
Lol joe Harris or James harden is gonna be the second worst shooter in that starting lineup when Kyrie is back
"Can only speak for the Nets because I don't know the bucks roster that well, but the have kd, kyrie, Harden, Joe Harris, DJ, Jeff Green, TLC (luwawu cabbarot, no idea how to spell it lol), Bruce brown and Landry shamet as solid rotation pieces. However u slice it, they have 3 solid players coming off the bench imo. They're real weakness is bigs for defense and rebounding, which they desperately need. With how well they shot this game, it should not have come down to the last possession."
"Joe Harris has a well rounded offensive game. He can finish near the basket too, and is a solid cutter.  I think the main problem is they don't have enough bigs without Jarrett Allen. In the first 7 mins of the 3rd quarter, DeAndre literally didn't make it back on offense to inside the 3 point line 5 times by my count. He was basically power walking and then just stopping if the play looked like an iso. Hopefully he's coasting and can turn it on a little more in the playoffs but that seems unlikely."
Joe Harris is gonna think he has super bad breath with the amount of space he’s gonna have to shoot 😂
Yes Joe Harris is indeed a star
"He’s an offensive system by himself.   Helps that MDA is there, Nets are running similar actions.   Of course, passing the ball to Kevin Durant and Joe Harris helps too.   But Harden is an savant in all aspects of offense."
JOE HARRIS
"Yes, Joe Harris  and the other 2!"
JOE HARRIS
"&lt;30% 3PT shooting and game almost won? Against the Nets? With Harden and KD?  I don't hate this score. Disappointed it's not a win but players on the Nets who aren't James Harden/KD got way, way undersold on their performances. Joe Harris and Jeff Green combined for 9-12 from 3. Don't expect that to happen every time."
"The bench is actually good. Bruce Brown is excellent, Joe Harris is averging 15 a game in incredible efficacy, and guys like TLC and Shamet can get hot any game."
"The Joe Harris-Harden pick and roll, with the guys doubling Harden and leaving Harris wide open was laughably bad defense and we ran that play like 3 times in a row."
"Joe Harris is a sniper too. And they have Spencer back next season as well. Nets are much better than /r/nba is giving them credit. Even this year, I think they have an okay bench with Jeff Green, Shamet, and TLC."
Joe Harris
Joe Harris who on this team has the easiest shots of his life
"KD is 32 and coming off a torn achilles. Harden is 31, fat and spent the last 6 months in titty bars. They’re playing with Joe Harris and a G-league squad. I know this has been beaten to death, but what the fuck Presti,  the Thunder would have won like four titles."
Having James Harden setting a pin down for KD is stupid.   Edit - while also having Joe Harris and Shamet one the floor with Kyrie ball handling. How the fuck do you defend that?
Joe Harris is dad fucking baller
Nobody is going to be able to stop this nets offense. You're going to outscore them. Joe Harris is the 4th best offensive player on this team and he's about to lead the the NBA in wide open 3's taken and he's gonna make 45% of them
Prime Joe Harris too.  Unfair.
Not likely that Jeff Green and Joe Harris go 9-12 from 3 often
Joe Harris becoming the Klay on this team lol
"Joe Harris is like the Nets fourth best player, they can’t trade him"
Joe Harris is gonna be this generation’s JJ. Dude is gonna play a looooong time
Joe fucking harris. holy shit this game is so intense i cant take it.
what a jab step by Joe Harris lol
Joe “Roger Federer” Harris
Joe Harris shooots like 125% from 3 but 78% from the ft line???
Joe Harris is unwashed Reddick
Joe Harris uses back cuts really well
yo joe harris is wide open every time
Kyrie needs to be careful &amp; comeback soon or Joe Harris will take that 3rd spot tbh
Joe Harris has the easiest shots ever on this team lol
Joe Harris looks like he need a cigarette
I love Joe Harris so much
Can’t leave Joe Harris even an inch of space
Joe Harris gets frequent haircuts
Joe Harris will hit the buzzer beater against the lakers to win the chip.
Will Joe Harris and Jeff Green continue to go 100% from three? Probably.
Jeff Green and Joe Harris combined 6/6 from 3 in the half. Lets see if they stay hot.
"I feel like Joe Harris can easily be a star player on a different team, like the guy is so much more than a 3 point shooter, and hes like literally the most lethal 3 point shooter right now"
I didn't check but I'm sure Joe Harris is shooting with 110% fg.
"Joe Harris is such a deadly weapon, *especially* on a team with players who have gravity and can penetrate and kick out. I hope he has a career year."
Joe Harris is what Harden wanted from Gordon
Joe Harris?
The Nets being able to keep Joe Harris is so huge.
Joe Harris is the Nets version of Klay Thompson
Joe Harris 30 bomb tonight
Joe Harris is so much more than just a 3pt shooter
Joe Harris and Jeff Green are ballers
You make a good point. I'm more surprised they didn't get Joe Harris as well.
god I love Joe Harris
Big 4 including Joe Harris
Joe Harris is legitimately the secret sauce
is Joe Harris' mouth bleeding?
Joe Harris got rid of the “Globo Gym” haircut??
Take a shot each time:  - Harden turns the ball over  - Giannis misses a FT  - KD scratches his head  - Joe Harris misses a defensive rotation  - Deandre Jordan misses an alley oop or layup
"Easily rather have joe harris, are you seriously hyping up luke kennard this much lmao"
"I think Kahwi guards Harden, and PG takes the KD assignment. I wouldn’t trust Pat Bev to handle either of Harden or Kyrie though, and that leaves a question mark on who takes on Joe Harris (Kennard?).  Either way the Nets will force switches until they have a KD v Kennard type of look."
"cmon, they're not THAT bad.  They still have Joe Harris who is a VERY respectable 3 pt shooter.  Jeff Green, who can give quality minutes here and there (not for long of course)  Shamet and Tyler Johnson who are good role players.  TLC is also a plus defender from what I've seen."
Joe Harris and Thoughts and Prayers? It will be defense by committee.
"I think our post defense is rightly criticized as terrible but I think the bench thing isn't completely accurate and honestly sounds a lot like how people criticized the Lakers bench last year.  Our starting line-up fully healthy (physically and mentally) against the Lakers will probably be Kyrie-Harden-KD-Jeff Green-DJ (assuming no more additions to the team). The bench consists of Bruce Brown, Shamet, Joe Harris, TLC, Reggie Perry. Joe Harris is obviously a very good role player, and players like Brown, TLC, and Shamet are actually solid (Shamet started the year terribly, but since some random Nets fan called him bad on Twitter a week ago he's been shooting like 45% from 3). Reggie Perry looks aight in the 2 games so far, but he's a rookie who knows. Also, Harden and KD are some of the best floor raisers in the league. Surround those 2 with just mediocre players, and they draw so much attention it makes those average players look extremely competent."
Lol that's my bad. I meant *Joe* Harris.
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
Yeah except instead of Kawhi it’s KD. Instead of PG it’s Harden. And then they have Kyrie fuckin’ Irving. Oh and then there’s Joe Harris who is one of the best shooters in the league. Any gaps they have will be easily filled in the buyout market. They don’t need much.  I swear people are just ignoring that this is an unbelievably stacked team. And nobody wants to admit it because we were all stoked about parity after KD wrecked the league for a couple years by joining the Warriors. And yet here we are.
"That's Joe Harris too, I think it just comes down to preference of contract but I'd rather have Joe imo. He also is a bit better on defense"
"Thank you for spending the time to write this up and I couldn't agree more. The Nets don't need to sign some amazing bench players, they just need solid players that can give them 5-15 minutes a game in non-crucial situations.  I also like how you gave Joe Harris his respect. He is currently shooting .494 on 6.1 3PA a game. He isn't just a great 3 point shooter, he's arguably a top 3/5 3 point shooter in the game while providing a lot more than just being a 3 point specialist."
"I think they’re close, and obviously Joe Harris has a better injury history, but Luke just provides so much more on offense than just elite shooting"
"With Kyrie, Harden, KD and Joe Harris they have more than enough shooting, they should focus on defense now."
Rather have Joe Harris
Its lowkey a good contract. Team option year 4 and youre on crack if you’d rather have Joe Harris over him at 4/72
"Teams with depth don’t beat teams with superstars in the playoffs in the NBA. It’s not football where the 53rd man muffing a punt or unable to be a good long snapper can lose the game.   Even if we play your game and pretend the 6th man matters as much as Tatum vs KD, you’re severely underrating the Nets depth. No team has a fourth option as good as Joe Harris and Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet are productive solid NBA options as well. TLC and Chiozza are no different from DiVincenzo/Nunn. You just started with the conclusion the Nets suck, and are grasping at straws to figure out why."
"If they didn't get rid of Jarrett Allen for Harden I'd say come to the nets but it's still a solid choice. KD, Harden, one of the best 3pt shooters in the league with Joe Harris. DeAndre Jordan can be a force on the interior. Itd be nice if Kyrie played a game once in a while but oh well. Or jump on the bandwagon with the Lakers. They're goings to the finals again."
Back to back stupid joe Harris posts lmao
Joe Harris has 4 threes   The entire lakers team has 3 threes
Wow joe harris
National viewers: this is why Joe Harris got PAID this summer.
"They really let Harden, KD and Kyrie team up with Joe Harris. SMH"
JOE HARRIS YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN
Joe Harris looks like he's the Gasol's half brother.
Jesus Christ can we stop helping off Joe Harris
"Joe Harris, good fantasy pickup"
Joe Harris *
joe fucking harris
Joe Harris is killing it

joe harris has one of the purest jumpshots i’ve seen...damn
Joe Harris is having a great season
Joe Harris is literally so fucking good
Joe Harris got a nice jumper like klay
JOE HARRIS GOD MODE
Joe fucking Harris
"Joe harris, so pure"
THE BANK IS OPEN FOR JOE HARRIS
Joe harris shog is pure
Joe Harris called bank boi
"joe harris 33333 lakers gotta step it up! nba's ""premier defense"""
joe harris literally taking 4 steps and a hop during his screen
TJ had ZERO interest in passing to a wide open joe Harris
Better than THT leaving Joe Harris wide open and throwing up terrible bricks
Joe harris has a scrape on his forehead what are u saying lmfao
"Joe ""Bruce Bowen"" Harris"
"Joe Harris will be the X-factor of these Nets in playoffs. If he lights it up, this team offense is almost unstoppable."
"The lost American Gasol brother, Joe Harris"
"Hilarious how LeBron gets more flack for teaming with AD  While KD, Harden, and Joe Harris are in the same team"
I’ll never understand how Joe Harris gets cut so often
Joe Harris is so bad at free throws
Joe harris being a bad FT shooter boggles my mind
"Brown was just called joe harris, we're off to a good start"
"Well you're obviously a Harden stan, but oh well:  https://pickinsplinters.com/2020/05/14/breaking-down-james-hardens-postseason-inefficiency/  The main issue here is, just as he has forced his scoring average up by manipulating bad officiating rules, Harden has forced himself into being a mediocre shooter with poor mechanics and exceptional range, and you portray him as a great shooter. Bullshit. Stephen Curry is a great shooter, Joe Harris is a great shooter, Duncan Robinson, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, are great shooters. Harden is the China of basketball, just a manufactured knock off version of the real deal born out of a dynamic of competitive necessity following the dominance of Curry. He's boring to watch, and he won't win a ring on his own merits. Your favorite player is kind of....shit."
"Harden has also been 50/40/90 on the nets, KD is like 50/40/85, I'm sure Joe Harris is in that ballpark as well"
&gt;Across the board Kyrie hs been more efficient and effective than Beal.   You do understand that comes with him playing with KD and Harden and Joe Harris and Beal's best teammate being Westbrook who is playing the worst ball of his career.
"I suspect he will easily exceed those deals.  Joe Harris is 29, FVV is 27. Trent is 22.  Somebody will sign him to a max offer sheet, hoping that he can still get better."
Even then they might just out gun them. Giannis would feast for sure but I have no doubt Harden could match his scoring on the other end. Then it just becomes a matter of Kyrie outplaying Middleton and Joe Harris catching fire. They wouldn’t be favoured but they could upset.
Probably something like FVV money or somewhere around joe harris money
"The general thought was that if he performed like he did last year, his price tag would only go up as the season went on.  As it stood, they locked in a 24-year-old coming off a 17/5/4 per 36 minutes on 44/40/89 shooting through age 28 for ""only"" $16 million per.  On paper, that looks like a good deal, especially when you see Bertans get $16 mil and Joe Harris getting 18.5.  Arguably, Kennard could have played his way closer to $18-20 a year in an otherwise weak free agency class.  I didn't like the deal because of his knees and the potentially awkward fit with PG and Kawhi.  But I understand the Clips' thinking."
Who would u replace joe Harris with?
"man with Trent playing like this what are you guys expecting to pay him? I'd guess at least Joe Harris money since there's room for him to grow as a defender, driver, and playmaker. they'll gladly pay it over what they'd pay a lot of guys but still."
Buddy Hield and Joe Harris? That wing defence is absolute trash.
He mentioned Joe Harris.
No love for Joe Harris or Bruce Brown??
Larry Nance  Zion  Joe Ingles   Gary Harris  Kyle Lowry   This also might be bordering on cheating too much with too many good players but off the top of my head what I came up with. Playmaking from multiple spots in general is something I think would help any Zion offense
"Beyond the Nets big 3 there’s nobody on the roster except Joe Harris and I’ve got no faith in Kyrie at all. Durant and Harden is pretty crazy though. Best duo in the league, right now?"
Not Joe harris
🎯Joe🎯Harris🎯🎯plays🎯basketball🎯😳🎯
I would definitely ask Joe Harris about that.
Harris. We picked him up off the scrap heap and built him into a machine. [Joe Jesus](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ucrVzWj-lYMcrWagfP3BnY9JVLMz6X93jAdMc_C_d9gT7P6bVOsMgw3S8vQreSbWMM0pVqI3PSKHhBS_m2H9mlZ2NwHQvevn4Kh1toqlntlQ_VQbcqmazIlVia_H5L6iMJOUxy49IzIfMCc) was great and was the one starter who always led our bench mob but his best days were in Atlanta.
So in that case would Kyrie Irving not be considered better than both Dame &amp; Harden at shooting? Is Joe Harris not a better shooter than Harden because of the ast %s?   Either way I think Dame &amp; Harden are toss ups. Different play styles. The ratio was just wild to me. -9 downvotes to +11 upvotes. Making it seem like we were comparing Ray Allen to Stephen Jackson
Joe Harris
"&gt;Joe has taken close to twice as many 3s as Marcus Morris has and 3 times or more as many threes as the other two players above him in addition to Bobby Portis Jr.  I don't consider that a significant factor.  I realize that many people do, but shooting more shots does not necessarily make them harder.  There is the not-insignificant consideration that shooting more enables a shooter to be in better rhythm, and more comfortable.  For exactly the same reason that coaches rarely call a play for a cold player fresh off the bench, shooting more shots during a game is not necessarily harder.  In addition, it is easier to shoot with a permanent green light.  Joe Harris will never be removed from a game for shooting a three, from anywhere, in any situation.  A guy like Morris or Portis might -- so he has to consider that, before and while shooting.  That's very much more difficult than shooting with zero conscience."
"Kinda the trade-off that comes with us getting rid of Atkinson tbh. He was probably not the guy to manage a contender and take them to the promised land but the dude developed talent like very few can. Ever since we acquired the stars and moved on from Kenny there just has not been the same organic development of young prospects, which obviously I'm not complaining about (Especially if we make a real run in the post-season) but we probably are not gonna see young guys on the Nets develop the way Joe Harris has for a while."
Watching a lot of nets game this season from the eye test alone Joe Harris is a much much better and more consistent than Klay ever was on the warriors.
"Makes sense. Obviously I also wanna see Steph there, but I'd love to see guys like Seth Curry, Fred VanVleet, Joe Harris, Duncan Robinson, etc."
"There are 4 teams right now who are ahead of mavs record breaking offense last year. And its actually not looking like a fluke at this point. Teams are just scoring at ridiculous rate. For example every one of brooklyns main 5 players, Jeff green Joe Harris kyrie kd and harden are all shooting 50% and 40% from three. Nets have 7 players with above a 61% true shooting, their team average for true shooting is 62%. And the clippers and bucks have similar numbers just citing the nets because I know it off hand. There has been an offensive explosion at the top end"
Steph  I want to see these guys against shooting role players tbh. Add in Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson
"&gt; Joe Harris would put up record numbers  Out of curiosity, what record number is he posting?  Not saying he isn't playing well."
"Get Steph, Joe Harris, Seth, Trae. Fuck it get Klay in here with his moon boot and he'll still go 37 pts in a quarter if its stand still shots."
"No I won't lmao there are plently teams where he wouldn't be the best shooter..I'll go through the teams off of the top of my head lmao  Warriors - steph and klay obviously loool Portland - Lillard and cj Utah - Joe Ingles and Bodanvic(sp?) Nuggets - Kat would be the best here. Porter is close Suns - booker  Clippers - kwahi and pg  Lakers - Kat would be the best  Mavs - Hardaway  Rockets - Kat would be the best, Gordon possibly  Spurs - don't watch enough of them but Kat probably  Kings - budy hield  Wolves - Kat New Orleans - jj  Memphis - Kat Okc - Kat   Heat - Robinson herro  Pacers - Malcom  Hawks - trea and bogdonvic(sp?) Wizards - beal Nets - harden kyrie kd and Joe Harris lol 76sers - Seth curry and Harris  Raptors - van fleet  Knicks- kat Celtics - brown possibly Tatum Magic - Kat but possibly vucevic or Ross Charlotte - Kat  Cavs - sexton  Bucks - middleton  Bulls - lavine  Pistons - Wayne Ellington   These are litterally without thinking too hard or looking at rosters lol. This is shooting in general that I would take over Kat. Some are arguable but idk Kat isn't the best shooter on most teams in my opinion"
Oh lol  It definitely sounded like u were implying joe Harris would clamp up rip Hamilton
"Right: Joe Harris would put up record numbers and prove to be a perfect role player next to stars / worth every penny  Wrong: The Warriors. I really thought Steph was going to struggle with this team, I was so so so so wrong."
"It's probably a mix of both but I'm inclined to think it's a lot of Joe Harris being Joe Harris. This is his 4th straight season of 40%+ 3 PT shooting. Like he's been a knock down shooter on sub par Nets teams as well. During the Bubble when our only NBA players were LeVert, Allen, and Joe, he was still shooting lights out."
"Joe Harris because the memory of Iso Joe is unfortunately tied with D-Will, who did have a bunch of really great years in the beginning, but would rarely show any heart or emotion when games started to actually matter."
"True ... they're just comparing star power tho, which is pretty close.  I'd still go with the GS big three but you have to exclude guys like Draymond, Joe Harris, etc."
Joe Harris is such a baller man. Such a consistent and complete player. Improves every year too.
"No shit idiot. My comment was clearly OT. Y’all streak got broken by Harden, Joe Harris, Jeff green and some bums who didn’t care in the first half 🤣🤣🤣"
"BKN fans, who do you guys love more: ISO Joe (Johnson) or Stroking Joe (Harris)?"
I mean we have Joe Harris as the spot shooter. KD.Harden/Kyrie all are good spot shooters but Harris is like 50% on 7 attempts a game.
The Nets would be better off in the playoffs trading Joe Harris for a defensive big man.
Joe Harris?  U think joe Harris would d up rip Hamilton
" I mean if you add antawn Jamison to kyrie, KD, harden, Joe Harris, Jeff Green, and Deandre Jordan then yeah it’s a super team"
Ignoring joe Harris and clax? Ignoring Kyrie and Harden?
"You’re acting like a team led by Kyrie and Harden isn’t a lock for conference finals, and finals when you include Joe Harris, Deandre, Blake, and Lamarcus.   Pick out any 2 players from the current Nets team’s top 5 players, and as long as only one of them is KD/Kyrie/Harden, then this is a finals team."
For the past few weeks hes been a moneymaker on 1st FG tho. I wish Brooklyn would stop adding players and KD/Kyrie/Harden would stay out forever. Fucking Joe Harris and DJ have been locks for like 2 or 3 straight weeks now
"KD has Harden, Kyrie and Joe Harris(best spot up shooter in the league). Come on now, it’s not the same impact."
How much help does joe harris need
Y'all worried about Blake Griffin and LMA when Joe Harris is the one who's gonna have his Ray Allen moment and be the lasting image of this team
"4th option is Joe Harris, a top 5 shooter in the league.   5th is LMA (maybe?), a borderline hall of famer who, while a shell of his former self, still puts up 10pts/5rebs in his sleep who can get a quality shot off of anybody in the league. 6th option is Blake, another borderline hall of famer who is still a very good passer, decent finisher at the rim, and has developed a very respectable 3 pt shot.  This doesn’t include guys like Deandre Jordan, Jeff Green, or Bruce Brown, who are literally 7/8/9 off the bench. I don’t think I’m overrating the talent on the Nets whatsoever."
"Joe Harris.   But I disagree with ""unquestionably"". I'm sure there's better ones -  for the raptors OG is our 4th option. I might be a homer but I think most teams would rate OG &gt; Joe Harris."
"I mean Joe Harris is shooting 49% from 3 on 7 attempts per game lol, dude is pretty good. 14ppg on 67% TS is an elite 4th option."
"yeah for sure. this dudes are top tier role players and this increases the Nets depth A LOT. and these guys also have something to play for so we might see more effort than previous seasons. Personally, my problem is with people treating them like all star talents. Like, Joe Harris is still their 4th best player, and Nic Claxton is still the best defender on the team. But depth? Sheeesh."
"Joe Harris,  Nic Claxton and Jeff green"
Joe Harris is washed?
harden is the guy handling the ball. he doesnt need to be good off ball. This offense might rival the warriors because theyre deeper offensively with joe harris and other role players. warriors had much better overall role players in green and iggy who were all defensive team caliber.
Joe Harris is better offensively than Draymond green. He’s scored over 20 points multiple times this year
"Fuck it give all the positions to Joe Harris, he’s been carrying those bums in Brooklyn"
"Bro stfu lmao so many teams had cap space to sign KD&amp;Kyrie, but none of them are in NY (minus the Knicks but do they really count) you only got Harden bc the Rockets had a personal vendetta against the Sixers who had a much better offer on the table. Your list of home grown players is like Joe Harris and nobody else lmfao embrace the villain role or fuck off"
Joe Harris Jeff Green even Claxton might all be better than Griffin and Aldridge. Thats their core imo.
those gsw teams were basically harden and KD (steph and KD) except kyrie was replaced with a DPOY defender and joe harris was replaced with an even better all-time shooter who could play defense and iggy was one of the best defenders in the league.  that balance of offense and defense is why they were basically unfair.  and KD wasn't even injured back then.
Yeah it’s all easy for Marks now but most GMs wouldn’t have dragged the Nets out of the cellar with the hand he was dealt. Joe Harris and Dinwiddie were literally thrown away by bad teams who needed talent badly but he turned them into great pieces. Even Claxton right now is making it easy to not miss Jarrett Allen and he got him in the second round.
"Nah, DJ would be decent.  On the other hand, who’s guarding KD, Harden, Kyrie, Joe Harris, Blake, and Aldridge?"
"Not even. Joe Harris, Nic Claxton, and Jeff Green are all clearly ahead of him."
"He drafted really well and made strong moves to get the Nets to be a playoff team before Kyrie and KD came. Both say they wouldn’t have come to the Nets if the Nets hadn’t already been showing good signs of turning it around before. Lifting the worst roster in the league with no lottery picks for the foreseeable future into a low-end playoff team is not that easy.   LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Claxton considering where they were taken was great, getting DLo to make him a contributor to a playoff squad and getting scraps thrown away by other teams and turning them into legit players like Dinwiddie and Joe Harris.   Yeah you can say his job is easy right now (and it is) but that’s disregarding all the great work he put in to get this franchise to this point."
damn this is some serious historical revision. the Nets....a destination? we weren't until KD and Kyrie signed. no one was lining up to play in Brooklyn for the nearly 10 years before that. literally our biggest FA signing before them in BKN was...i dont even know. Joe Harris? Andrei Kirilenko?
And imagine telling them that Joe harris would be better than blake and lamarcus
"Dwight was risky to sign since he had a bad image on his name from the rockets and lakers. Also he wasn’t in his prime at all.   Rondo wasn’t doing good in the regular season and didn’t come until the 2nd round. Dwight didn’t play a game in the 2nd round.   Plus they didn’t have the offense power off all of those players mentioned. Lakers don’t even have a player like joe Harris whose shooting 50% from three. How are you going to possibly defend all of those guys. Also nic claxton is better than Blake and lma defensively, who is also getting underlooked as well."
Its not even the same team at all lol. I think Joe Harris is the only dude still there from the old team.
"100 times, at what volume? Sure Joe Harris could do it too. How many of them lead the league in scoring that season?"
"Nah if that were the case these guys would be on the Knicks. We had great player development for a couple years which led to a good culture. DLo, LeVert, and Allen all became valuable assets that led to our team, and Joe Harris and Dinwiddie were also developed and a big part of the team."
truly Joe Harris is the most sinister of all
"Harden, Kyrie Irving, kevin durant, Blake griffin, deandre Jordan, Lamarcus Aldridge, Jeff Green, Claxston, shamet, Bruce brown, Joe Harris, spencer dinwiddie. They have enough talent to create 2 playoff caliber starting lineups. Seems fair /s"
"Bruh you gotta at least have some form of knowledge before you try to say things like that lmao. Kyrie, KD, and Harden are all on contract with the Nets through 2023... literally the exact same year that Lebron’s extension ends. Hell even Joe Harris’ contract runs through 2024."
How much help does Joe Harris need?
"Yea, sure, I’m the casual for thinking that prime kyrie and harden, along with joe Harris, Blake griffin, and lamarcus Aldridge have a 0% chance of winning a title. Yup, very dumb of me to think that the team running through the league right now has any chance win the title.   You’re a fool, harden and kyrie make the nets simply unstoppable on the offensive end. They can beat any team on any given night because of that. I’m not even saying they’re favorites, but the way they’re playing right now shows they would have a good shot without KD."
"Doesn't matter when he is on the floor with Harden, KD , Kyrie and Joe harris. His inside game is gonna flourish"
Built around Joe Harris
"You have 3 guys who can drop 50 tho. How often do Kyrie, KD, and Harden all have an off night at the same time? Then you gotta count on Joe Harris who has one of the highest 3PT percentage in the league over the past few seasons having an off night at the same time and also hope that all of these buyout guys are also cold. That’s a lot to ask."
Lol wtf. It wouldnt be close. Lakers win bad. Lakers also have good role players who mesh with stars. Nets only have joe harris. Lakers top 3 better as well plus davis is the best defender lol
"Are you comparing Westbrook and Beal to KD, Harden, Kyrie, Blake, LMA, and Joe Harris?"
"This Nets team is beyond ridiculous, if they don't win the title this year, it would easily be the biggest embarrassment in league history imo.  The other ones that come to mind are 2011 Heat, 2015 Clips, 2016 Thunder, 2016 Warriors, 2020 Clippers, etc.   But this is just insanely ridiculous. Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc   I cannot even envision this team losing the title this year, so I would be shocked."
"That’s not the point though  James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris WILL play when it matters and then when one of them comes off you got extremely experienced vets to come on and maintain leads   They’re going to be insanely hard to beat 4 times out of 7 games, they have 5 or 6 players that could score 25 points in a game pretty easily"
Such bullshit. Only reason I’ll be happy is Joe Harris went to hs close to my Hometown and is a super good guy but other than that fuck the nets
"When Blake griffin, joe Harris, and LMA get played off the floor in the playoffs we’ll revisit"
"Don’t include LMA and Griffin if you’re not including Joe Harris. Joe Harris &gt;&gt; LMA , Blake"
I don’t think it even compares to the 2017 Warriors. You’d need the 4th best player on the Nets to measure up to flamethrower Klay or DPoY Draymond. Joe Harris is a monster but he ain’t quite there.
Joe Harris has all the infinity stones
"When you’re the 7th option on a team with Durant, Harden, Kyrie, Blake Griffin, and even Joe Harris you’re gonna be in a much easier place than the first option on a rebuilding roster lol"
"Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green, Joe Harris, TLC, Shamet, Tyler Johnson, Claxton, etc  This is a finals lock, it would be an absolute embarrassment if they do not win the title this year."
Injury them. ;) JK But umm try to force an open 3 that isn’t from the big 3 and joe harris if u can I guess idk just pray
"Yea but Kyrie is super efficient and Harden will completely defer if u try to trap him. This isn't Houston Harden anymore and from alot of the replies I've seen here, they just act like the Nets are just the big 3 and G leaguers completely ignoring that the Nets have set up snipers like Joe Harris and Shamet around them to discourage trapping"
"Not easy. I would probably actually focus on taking away any rim action from DJ, stick on Joe Harris, and try to play the best defense you can on Harden and Kyrie and KD without sending too much help. You have to hope Harden goes cold and dominates the ball, and play better offense"
Thing is the we had Kyrie as the second option. Nets have Kyrie as the third option behind Kevin Durant and James Harden. Then you have Joe Harris and his ridiculous 3 point shooting. The Nets offensive talent is beyond ridiculous when compared to the rest of the league.
I mean Joe Harris had a mediocre game for his standards but I appreciate that you include him.   /s just in case
"the nets have three of the most prolific offensive players of last decade plus one of the most consistently accurate 3 point shooters in joe harris, the jazz do not have comparable shooting personnel, plus are missing their best offensive player. Not to say they aren't still heavily favored, but that's the reasoning i think people are using."
I’m just waiting for the big three to get 40 and like joe Harris with 10 points.
Joe Harris best player  Kevin Durant the biggest snakey bitch in sports  Irving the fake woke Qanon conspiracist   Harden the biggest flopping bitch ever  The Nets buying a championship
I don’t know what games people are watching when they call Harden a plus defender. There have been moments on the Nets where he’s looked as bad as ever. In last years playoffs game 1-4 were sold of the worst defense you’ll see. This is basically just a reputation thing. After he was so bad for a time we heard about all the improvements he made and being good against bigs. But he’s not actually a plus defender as a whole. I would comfortably say Joe Harris is a better defender assuming the other plus is KD or Claxton. I’d even say Kyrie is better than Harden on that end and has taken on tougher assignments.
And what will Embiid do? Score 40? Cool. Then thats 30 for KD 30 for Harden 30 for Kyrie and another 20 for Joe Harris/Shamet. I don't think Simmons or Middleton can produce anything more than 20 lmao
"Small market teams had the same opportunity to pick Joe Harris or Spencer Dinwiddie off waivers, or draft LeVert, J. Allen in the late 1st round, or Nic Claxton in the 2nd round.  This is not just about big vs. small market."
"They did a good job finding Allen, LeVert, Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and DLo using limited resources before KD and Kyrie. Their front office is pretty good."
"No they won’t.  Joe Harris and DeAndre Jordan are the only players left with contracts of substantial amounts (for salary matching purposes), only young trade assets are Shamet and Claxton?  No picks to trade...  buy outs and vet mins are their only way to add talent for a while."
"yeah it looks like they were going to KD a lot (rightfully so), but Joe Harris only have 1 3 point attempt in the first half is not a good game plan"
Or to an open Joe FUCKING Harris
Felt bad for Joe Harris. Had a lot of open looks and wasn’t getting the ball. We need to get the whole team involved.
Joe Harris
This is essentially the Joe Harris fan club.
Joe Harris looks like someone I would see at any Brooklyn bar. Dude is a great shooter tho
"It made no sense... And after he got the ball back from Joe Harris, he should have taken a floater or a mid-range shot instead of kicking out. He had tons of space."
Joe Harris has to literally die for a ref to call it a foul wtf
They have bird rights for Harden and Joe Harris
"My turn, your turn, Kyrie’s turn. Joe Harris shoot an open 3. Blake Griffin open dunk. Uncle Jeff poster off Harden splitting the defenders. Rinse and repeat. Lol"
"I wanna see a guy like Embiid or Jokic with a super-shooting team, just for kicks. Not even for like an official game, just an exhibition match for the spectacle. Like, a line-up of Steph Curry/Joe Harris/Duncan Robinson/Joe Ingles/Embiid or Jokic. Steph isn't allowed to do Steph things, purely just a dominant post-up threat down low and the four best catch-and-shoot shooters* in the league surrounding him.  Like the Finals-run Dwight Howard Magic on steroids.  *I don't know who statistically the four best catch-and-shooters are this year, but I think that's a pretty solid guess at the actual top four, right?"
Joe Harris. My man.
"Oh wait, they have joe harris I forgot."
Joe Harris and the refs are better than any of the other players on the nets combined
The nets playing exactly how a team of the three best iso players ever would play. Iso. Iso. Iso. Action for joe Harris. Iso. Iso. Iso.
Joe Harris has been the best Net tonight tbh.
It had to be joe Harris didn’t it
Of course it’s Joe Harris that makes the first Brooklyn three
"Steph is insane and all, but god *damn,* I knew Joe Harris was having a great shooting season percentage-wise but I didn't realize he was doing it on *six attempts a game*"
We stan Joe Harris
They have too much talent for him to do that. There's no point in playing Joe Harris if KD is going to throw up ten shots in a quarter.
Give me joe harris or give me death
Na let them iso. I would hate to see Joe Harris splash 3s
Joe Harris is just a 6’7” lil dicky. Prove me wrong.
"lol dude. they also had LMA who unfortunately had to suddenly retire due to health, and they have joe harris, who has the best 3pt percentage in the whole league."
WAIT JOE HARRIS IS WHITE !?!?!?
Joe Harris lol
"yeah, I mean Joe Harris can't win with these cats"
Joe Harris +4
Just replace Joe Harris with Deandre and you can still do it
This looks like one of those 2K lineups where young Joe Harris has created himself in the game and traded for all his favourite stars to play with haha
"Joe Harris and 4 no names. Good luck, Joe"
Joe Harris can't win with these cats.
Joe Harris the only star.
"Nets starting lineup: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin  💀"
It's not fair that they have Joe Harris as well
"As a Nets fan that scares me.  I'll hope he forces his way to Brooklyn somehow lol.  DJ, re-signed Dinwiddie, and Joe Harris to match contracts"
"Doncic only shoot 35% from 3s but everytime I watch him play, he's shooting like Joe Harris"
"Shut up nerd.  This guy wants Joe Harris taking the last shot, not MJ."
"Calling crabbe good, joe Harris “only a shooter”...  Bait post"
1.	KD   2.	Kyrie  	 3.	Harden  	 4.	Nic Claxton  	 5.	Joe Harris
"Generally speaking Redditors love certain categories of players.  1. Volume shooter with good TS - Curry, Dame, Beal, Lavine   2. 3 point specialist with high consistency - Ingles, Joe Harris, Clarkson, Seth Curry   3. Lots of blocks and steal - Myles Turner, Thybulle   4. 3 &amp; D specialists - Covington, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges  Sometimes they go out of fashion but based on what I have seen here, it is generally true.  Players with 'clutch' reputation also have a lot of goodwill.   On the other hand, Triple double gang has polarized reputation."
"That's not how basketball works. The defense can ALWAYS dictate your touches by doubling and tripling you. It's just that most of the times they can't afford to do that, because getting an NBA player a wide open look is usually the worst thing you can do.   You can double Harden all day and let him get no touches at all if you want Joe Harris to torch you. You can do the same for Lebron, and Kuzma would drop 30 points on you and destroy your team.    That, for the 2021 Warriors, wasn't the case. I think this was one of the first times in NBA history that the opposing teams would rather have any other player shoot a wide open shot than have Curry shoot a contested one, which made double teams practical in every single situation. In the final play in regulation the Grizzlies basically left Draymond absolutely wide open in a get-a-stop-or-lose situation. You just can't have that."
14 needs to be Kispert  We need that Joe Harris type shooter so badly
He's poor man's Joe Harris.
"Kinda impossible to be ‘random’ and have that type of impact in the playoffs but I get what you mean…  **Seth Curry**- can’t be understated enough how much of a non-scorer Simmons is. All it takes is a smart coach and the right defender and he’s practically Draymond green. So, Curry will be that 3rd scorer and I can see him having a 20-25 point timely game   **Joe Harris**- Jump shots will stop falling for 2 of the big 3, and Harris will get open looks and have a 20 point game. Media will jump all over it  for the unsung hero angle   **Mikal Bridges**- he’s not even really random but since it’s vs LA the masses and media will be shocked at anyone other than the big names playing big. Bridges will have at least 1 game where he’s hitting open 3s all game   **Enes Kanter** - Kanter always gets buckets, he’s gonna have that 1 game where he gets enough minutes and shots to score around 20. Denver may be a perfect matchup for him since they will almost always have a traditional 5 in so Kanter can stay on the court"
joe harris is gonna shoot 100% from the floor on &gt;12 shots every game 7
"We have a lot   Joe Harris - 33rd pick   Spencer Dinwiddie 38th pick   Bruce Brown - 42nd pick   Nic Claxton - 31st pick    (if we're talking about only players we drafted specifically, then Claxton is the only answer)"
Thats why I didn’t bring up scoring or offensive rating. I’m just looking at the individual players. And it simply is easier to exploit Draymond/Iggy than Joe Harris and Jeff Green. If we are looking just at the Big 3 then the Warriors get the edge.
To be fair Joe Harris shoots almost 44% from 3 over his career. He’s actually on pace to be one of the best 3 point shooters of all time.
Joe Harris gets his revenge tour on LeGM for getting traded off the Cavs
You think Duncan Robinson look up to Joe harris
Did you even watch the games? Draymond shot 39% from 3FG in the 73 win season. But once KD came he was a crap 3 point shooter and midrange shooter. Teams could leave him WIDE OPEN and that destroyed the Warriors spacing. The Nets don’t have that type of weak shooter in their closing line up. With Jeff Green and Joe Harris the Nets have zero weaknesses on offense.
"When he wins FMVP the narrative will be ""how much help does Joe Harris need?"""
"Next summer I’m going to one of my best friends wedding, his fiancé is cousins with Joe Harris….hoping he shows up so I can drunkenly tell him how underrated he is lol"
Dread it. Run from it. A loss to Joe Harris comes all the same.
"Shooting off the dribble, finishing, off ball movement. Essentially most things except spot up shooting, where i'd say they are pretty equal  Also, even if joe harris has better numbers, he gets way easier shots because he is the 4th option behind 3 of the best offensive players in the league, instead of 2nd option behind only 1"
"While I can totally see the argument that Luka is top 5, why does 2 playoff games now cement that?   It would be like me saying that Joe Harris being one of the best 3 point shooters of all time is now set in stone after his last two games."
What makes Klay a better catch n shoot player than Joe Harris? Significantly worse efficiency on 2 less attempts per game? That's also the difference between Damian and Klay. Is Damian a better catch n shoot player?
His shot profile is way closer to Joe Harris than it is to KD/Curry/Harden/Kyrie.
"Name a player that averages more attempts than Joe Harris while being more accurate from 3. Offensively, he's Klay with lower highs and higher lows. He's an all-time great three point shooter."
U pretty much have to double team these three and if you do there’s still joe Harris
"I’m not sure why you’re being down voted like you pulled that out of your ass lol. The only player with more catch &amp; shoot 3s than Joe Harris is Duncan Robinson.    That being said, as a Nets fan, I’m taking my boy Joe"
I think it would be Joe Harris and Shaun Livingston
And Draymond is the only reason game 7 2016 was even close lmao. Plus Draymond is a better playmaker than anyone on the nets aside from harden. And a DPOY. Joe Harris is a good shooter. But that's it.
"Exactly. You have to be someone who really rarely even checks boxscore, watches highlights or let alone watches any games to not know who Joe Harris is and what his game is."
"I mean, they also are super efficient because they play with one another.. and are unselfish.   But like Joe Harris on Minnesota idk if he’s 48%"
Yes Joe Harris and Blake are the key to overcoming the best team every assembled lmao
Why is everyone so hung up on Joe Harris? Lmao
Nets defense is above average and I can’t believe they have Joe Harris
"Yeah, too bad he was on such a shitty team with Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris Lavert, Joe Harris, and Jarrett Allen. That team already had a good shot of winning the title but Durant can't help but always take the easiest way possible."
"Yeah, but who on that Warriors team compares to Joe Harris?"
"Yup  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ljgmob/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_1612_defeat/gnchlpb/  All the people clamoring about their defense as if it was gonna be the worst the playoffs have ever seen are idiots.  That comment was back in February and they only played a couple more games together after that. So ridiculous that people throwing out all these judgements about a team who didn't give a fuck about defense, had two injured stars taking time, and a flat-earther who kept taking personal leave  No team with 3 bona fide superstars + Blake Griffin and Joe Harris is going to be anything but frightening as fuck in the playoffs, when the veteran stars turn on the intensity and are actually playing together.  The Nets are surprisingly deep. The Blake Griffin acquisition is wild with how he looked in Detroit (people saying he has to retire) compared to now. You got players like Shamet, Jeff Green, Claxton all contributing off the bench at a level you'd think would make them a starter on a ""3 superstars + trash"" type team that people were expecting. Even players like Tyler Johnson, Mike James, and Cabarrot looked good at times last year, and they're fighting to just see the court at all with how deep the Nets are."
The difference between Joe harris and every 4th option on that Warriors team is the biggest difference
"Because he was one of the top players on that Pistons team and was guarded pretty well. So driving takes more effort.  In a team with KD, Harden, Kyrie and Joe Harris are you really guarding Blake?  Take a look at this highlight itself, he casually jogs to the rim and slams it down. A lot of his ""monstrous"" dunks are like that because he is unguarded.  One of his first dunks involved him running from the 3 point to dunk, the entire lane was open and no one guarded him.  &amp;#x200B;  Also he is on reduced minutes. He rarely plays more than 25 minutes,  I don't think he has crossed 30 minutes even once. He was playing over 35 minutes for Pistons. This game he played for just 20 minutes, same in Game 1.  Also he was a facilitator in Pistons, over here obviously he isn't.  &amp;#x200B;  With such a limited role and more free space he is able to dunk more."
"Joe Harris, Wade, Bosh, Ray Allen, Mike Miller, Battier, Kyrie, Love, JR, Rose, Crowder, George Hill, Clarkson, Nance, Korver, AD, Schroder, Marc Gasol, Drummond, Trezz"
"What about offensive role players? Harden’s playmaking is better than Curry and Klay combined. He makes Joe Harris, Green and Blake far more deadly. Meanwhile you got Draymond bricking open 3’s all day."
We literally have one player on our roster who we drafted. Comes with not having draft picks.   Joe Harris was a gleague player before he got into the Atkinson system here. And Kyrie grew up here in New Jersey as a huge Nets fan. They’re home grown.
No fucking way should Middleton guard Kyrie lmao he'd get cooked. Middleton getting joe Harris.
"Well, that's a bit different because they signed FAs. If they blew everything they had on KD and Kyrie they would be shit as well because they wouldn't have Harden and roleplayers like Joe Harris (had 25 tonight)"
"I feel if they eventually win it all, the Rockets gifted them.  I expected the Rockets to demand for a King's ransom.  Delay the trade till when Joe Harris was trade eligible . Rockets got no value for the James trade , they ended up with Olynyk"
Couldn’t be more perfect. Open Joe Harris 3 or open Jeff Green dunk. Pick your poison.
Nets have way more versatility and playmaking. Plus adding Joe Harris and Blake
Nobody is better than Season Reward Ruby Joe Harris.
there’s been an addition. We now have a big 4. Fear joe Harris. Dread him. Run from him.
That's correct. The only logical thing to do is to cut Joe Harris.....because racism.
Suns guarding Lebron like the Celtics guarded Joe Harris
"Easily the funniest timeline. Imagine the Lakers making a run all the way to the finals and shutting down KD, Harden and Kyrie, just to lose to Joe Harris dropping 45 a game"
"What about DeAndre Jordan, Blake Griffin and Joe Harris?"
The East runs through Joe Harris
Yeah it's obviously not perfect... After all joe harris is certainly not 10% better than Steph when wide open
Joe Harris been on the team longer than the big 3 lol
"I stopped watching when I realized the Nets were just gonna bend them over tonight, but Joe Harris was playing so well. I've known he's a good shooter, but the man really has game."
"Individually yes. But as a 3rd option behind two MVPs, Klay is probably the best choice in the league. Can put up 20+ a night without ever having to be a focus on offense. Guys the2nd best shooter ever probably and doesn't ever need the ball like Kyrie does to be effective.   KD, Steph, and Harden need the ball more and are all more valuable with the ball in their hands than Kyrie is. So yeah Kyrie is better.. But Klay is better for the situation on either team.   And joe Harris isn't what's tipping the scales lmao. It's KD and Harden"
"Tonight's gonna be Drummonds Bryn Forbes, Joe Harris type game"
"Aaaand thats me as a new/casual NBA viewer. I was looking at the stat sheet and like ""who the hell is Joe Harris?"". KD, Harden and Kyrie is BS enough already and they still have other good shooter? Just hand them the trophy already"
Brooklyn KD &gt; GS KD  Harden = Curry  Irving &gt; Green  Joe Harris &gt; Klay  Griffin &gt; McGee
"When you add Joe Harris to the mix, the chance of winning drastic go down (is that how it goes its been so long)"
"The willingness of this nets team to share the ball is also underrated, Joe Harris shot 14 times tonight while Harden, Kyrie and KD only shot 12 times each. Because he had the hot hand so they fed him."
And the big 3 have all urged Joe Harris to get his shots this season after passing up many open looks.
