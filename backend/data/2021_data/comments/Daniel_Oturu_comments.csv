Daniel Oturu :)
DO is obviously LA clippers 33rd pick rookie Daniel Oturu. It’s like y’all don’t follow the NBA
"Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges are mature young guys, same with Jevon Carter.    I think Anthony Edwards has all the potential in the world, and KAT is an Elite talent.   They are worth keeping.     But everyone else is not good for the Timberwolves, including Malik Beasley.    It doesn't matter how many points you put up, if you character isn't gonna help the team. It would be smart to trade him.    Trade Rubio to the Clippers for Lou Will, T Mann, and Daniel Oturu"
"On the other hand, the Clippers have a better win % than the 76ers with Embiid in the games that Daniel Oturu actually plays.  They're screwed."
"&gt; he can shoot better than Rubio and plays decent defense  What's the argument then for why the Clippers suddenly get ""insanely dangerous"" if they downgrade at shooting and defense with Rubio instead of Beverley? Also, keep in mind that because of the hard cap a straight swap of Rubio for Beverley doesn't work, the Clippers would also have to add either Lou Williams to the trade, or both of Patrick Patterson and Daniel Oturu (while being unable to spend any money to replace those two empty roster spots because of the hard cap)."
"We'll give you Daniel Oturu and a Kawhi autograph, final offer."
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
"Yeah we barely have anyone who only gets minutes when the game is completely over. Closest would probably be Daniel Oturu but definitely not because he's bad, he's just a raw rookie."
Clippers about to start Daniel oturu
The Daniel oturu game
Daniel Oturu has been absolutely HUGE for the clippers today. Such an underrated player
Daniel Oturu was a god tier tank commander in that OKC game
"All I know is that if it wasn’t for Clippers tanking, Daniel Oturu might never have a double double career night in the league ever. So thanks Ty Lue  https://youtu.be/WP5CpaBtzl4"
Nah bro it had to have been Daniel Oturu
This has Daniel oturu all over it.
I understand supporting your teams players but that would be like me saying Daniel Oturu is going to be better than AD in his prime
"Moses was good but most of those blocks were on Daniel Oturu, who took 21 shots."
time to watch the famed Daniel oturu iso offense only seen one other time this season
Daniel Oturu has playoff points.
Anyone could tell you this. They tried so hard to lose against OKC that Daniel Oturu took 21 shots and only 2 guys in the rotation right now got real minutes.
"There's a ton of untapped potential in Africa, I mean look this past years draft had 8 players of Nigerian descent:  Onyeka Okongwu (Hawks) Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers ) Precious Achiuwa (Heat) Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) Desmond Bane (Celtics) Udoka Azubuike (Jazz) Jordan Nwora (Bucks) Daniel Oturu (Timberwolves)  And that's just players of Nigerian descent, African is a big ass continent with a shitload of different people. Wise investment here for the NBA. It also makes me wonder whether they'll be investing in India as well, another place with a huge population and the potential to produce NBA players and grow the NBA's international audience"
Put Daniel oturu in the game yo
"If we had drafted Xavier Tillman instead of Daniel Oturu, we'd be the 3-seed and the Warriors would be in the playoffs"
"\[Lue\] ""I don't give a damn what anybody else thinks on the outside. We decided to go health over anything else. We finally got our team healthy, and that is what we focused on.""  Daniel Oturu a shaman. He needed 4 frog pelvic bones and 21 field goal attempts for a perfect team health the rest of the postseason.      https://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/31468672/la-clippers-coach-ty-lue-says-strategy-end-regular-season-was-health-anything-else"
because OKC had very good rep and you hate to see Daniel Oturu iso to ice their tank pnr.  ya dont need to be a basketball purist to absolutely abhor that game
"We knew they would end up at 6 or 7. A Clippers loss would ensure they don’t see them until the WCF. Which increases the odds of them having their most successful season in history. I don’t hate it.   The health and only health argument went out the window the moment your 15th man took 21 shots. The intention was clear at that point. I have my own speculation as to what the reason was for that and you can disagree or make your own, or continue to argue that a team running their offense through Daniel oturu in crunch time wasn’t trying to lose a game"

"Nahhh, rather then getting more picks, they were trying to tank and convert their pick this year into a high lottery pick (potentially top 3). However, Tank Commander Daniel Oturu had other ideas :("
"They called at least 55 plays for Daniel Oturu midrange post up shot. It was fucking hilarious, I don't think I remember seeing a team trying to lose so blatantly"
Tank of the year is 100% the clippers playing Daniel Oturu 37 minutes and letting him take ISO shots.
"To trade for Wall the Clippers would have to send Kennard, Beverley, Rondo and Yogi Ferrell just to make the salaries match. And with Reggie Jackson likely to leave in free agency that would leave Wall as the only point guard on the Clippers roster. With Kawhi and Ibaka both likely to miss all of next season and with Batum also likely to leave in free agency, that also would mean that the only players the Clippers would have for next year would be PG, Wall, Morris, Mann and Zubac, with Daniel Oturu being the only guy off the bench. They'd still be over the cap, so no way to sign any free agents (other than with the taxpayer MLE of $5 million and vet minimums). They do own their own pick this year (25th), but that's the only pick they have in the draft.   TL;DR - I think it's highly unlikely they trade for John Wall."
"The 2020 NBA Draft had Onyeka Okongwu, Isaac Okoro, Precious Achiuwa, Udoka Azubuike, Zeke Nnaji, Daniel Oturu, Jordan Nwora and Desmond Bane who were either from Nigeria themselves or had a parent from Nigeria.  So not only is the top end talent promising, but they would be able to field a deep team"
I’d like to trade Dame for Daniel Oturu please
"Just FYI, Kennard and Beverley wouldn't be enough to match salaries, the Clippers would also have to include either Rondo, Zubac or both Yogi Ferrell and Daniel Oturu to make the trade work under the cap. Considering Reggie Jackson might leave in free agency in addition to this, I don't see the Clippers wanting to send their remaining three point guards out for Kemba."
"Just FYI, Kennard and Beverley wouldn't be enough to match salaries, the Clippers would also have to include either Rondo, Zubac or both Yogi Ferrell and Daniel Oturu to make the trade work under the cap.   But that aside, I do think they would be averse to taking on Kennard's contract. Even if it's ""just"" three years at $14 million per year, that's still extremely unappealing for a team looking to tank and rebuild, unless they're planning to still be fully tanking three years from now (and I'm guessing that's not the plan). Cap space is pretty key for such a team. Rondo, Beverley and Ibaka all being expiring is probably much more appealing (plus easier to move). OKC might take Kennard, but it would probably take both the 25th pick and their 2028 pick to do it."
"They can send him here via trade, We will send Daniel oturu and Jay scrubb. These aint made up names btw."
I WILL BE SMOKING A DANIEL OTURU PACK TONIGHT
FUCK DANIEL OTURU LETS GO
"Daniel Oturu, Jay Scrubb, and Patrick Patterson took that personally."
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner.

"I actually think that tanking, ironically enough, is worse for playoff teams right now than lottery teams.   This obviously sounds wacky, but the final few days or so of the season is always a clown show of teams vying for particular seeds (see, Daniel Oturu taking as many shots in the final game as he had in the previous 20 combined). Sure, it’s much more contained than tanking for a bottom 3 record (which often starts in earnest mid season), but it’s also more jarring — a 28-win team playing like an 18-win team isn’t exactly THAT noticeable, whereas a 55 win team playing like a 15 win team is comical. Too, at least the team’s tanking for picks are trying to find valuable young players with a bright future. The playoff teams intentionally putting out their 10th-15th players usually have zero interest in seeing what the young players can actually do because they’re likely just roster filler."

"Hey you wanna make this a white guy thing, he also reminds me of Caleb Swanigan and Daniel Oturu but slower and worse at blocking shots.  Thants who Luka Garza is more likely to compare to in the NBA in terms of being basically just a guy."
I hate Daniel Oturu so much.  Ruined the Thunders tank
"I was at Carbone, which is this pretty nice Italian restaurant. And next to me at the table, the table next to me was: Rajon Rondo, Patrick Beverley, and Daniel Oturu. And while I’m sitting at the table (a little bit more intoxicated than I should have been admittedly), the news that all three of these guys had been traded to Memphis drops. And seeing Patrick Beverley jump on top of the table, at a five star Italian restaurant, screaming at the top of his lungs “I JUST WON THE F-ING PLAY IN GAME!” Over and over and over again was enough to make me sick."
"Yeah, but by trading away JV, they got Adams plus:  * Move up from 17th to 10th * Move up from 51st to 40th * 2022 first round pick * Patrick Beverley * Rajon Rondo * Daniel Oturu (prospect)  Which helps fill out their depth a bit and starts getting them up above the cap so they can eventually trade for larger salary contracts to pair with their young stars (if they want to go that route)."
"\[Wojnarowski\] The Los Angeles Clippers are trading Patrick Beverley, the next 3 years, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu to the Memphis Grizzlies for guard Eric Bledsoe, sources tell ESPN."
Do you think clips beat the mavs and jazz without him? Is Daniel oturu a wcf clipper and kawhi isn’t?
"A hypothetical sign and trade could work out - but the question is do the Spurs (or any team?) actually want the contracts that the Clippers are sending out. Assuming Reggie Jackson resigns for $11m (the max he can with the Clippers) and Kawhi signs a 1+1 ($39m) they'd be at $162m\~ in payroll.      The tax apron would require them to get under $144m most likely.      So a hypothetical deal of Rondo + Yogi Ferrell (not fully guaranteed) + Daniel Oturu would amount to 10m (If derozen would even accept 10m). Then trade off the expiring contract of Pat Beverly + 2nd round pick into a team that can absorb the cap. It would put them close to below the tax apron.      But of course, none of this actually makes sense for the Spurs to take on Rondo, ferrell, oturu ha."

"I'm puzzled Turner says that DeRozan is putting the brakes on going to the Lakers cause he doesn't want to take that big of a pay cut, but then in the same article says DeRozan is thinking about going to the Clippers when they can't offer him any more money than the Lakers can.   And look, I know people are gonna be like ""the Clippers can just sign and trade for him"" but no, they really can't. So before you go thinking the Clippers are any better equipped to stay under the hard cap than the Lakers are, [you should really have a look at how huge the Clippers payroll is going to be this year.](https://i.imgur.com/xukgBa5.png) Allow me to do the math on that: that's $134 million just for those 8 players. The hard cap is going to be $143 million.   Now I want you to also consider that this $134 million total doesn't include a few things. For one, it sure seems likely that Kawhi will not opt in for that final year, which means he'll probably opt out and sign a 1+1 for an extra $3 million (exactly the same amount as Paul George this year). This total also does not include the combined $6 million for Terrance Mann, Daniel Oturu, and their new 1st round pick, Keon Johnson. And finally it does not include the salaries of either Nic Batum or Reggie Jackson.   The Clippers total salary this year figures to probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of $160+ million, which is very far above the $143 million hard cap. So no, I don't think DeRozan is likely to join the Clippers, for the same reason he's unlikely to join the Lakers: $5.9 million is probably too little for him."

This is also a lie. The running joke from Godfrey was Igbos would go to KKK University to get an education because an education is that serious to us. We have a history of being global travelers and missionaries dating back to BC. I am obviously right. Don't tell me I am wrong when I am not.   Correct me only when I am wrong. The bottom line is don't be claiming superiority when all of your best are half Black American or Igbo or White British like AJ.   How many full Yorubas are currently in the NBA right now? Daniel Oturu? Who else?
Lies. Just about all of the Nigerian NBA players are currently Igbo or half Igbo in the NBA right now outside of Daniel Oturu and Bam Adebayo  Name one non Igbo Nigerian in the NBA currently that I missed?
"Clippers vs OKC last game of the season was the most obvious example  GM and coaches know how to lose - Lue ran like 10 Daniel Oturu isos in the 4th quarter  Players, no matter how bad/young/raw won't lose on purpose hence why OKC won because Poku scored like 29 points or smth"
"You guys already sent out Pat Beverley, Rajon Rondo and Daniel Oturu for Eric Bledsoe, so that was $23 million in outgoing salary right there. All you'd have had to do was include Kennard and you'd have had the salaries to match on Westbrook instead of Bledsoe. Kennard gets DNP-CDs fairly regularly (even in the playoffs) so it's not like he's worth keeping over having someone like Westbrook. Personally I think Westbrook is better than Bledsoe and Kennard, but maybe you disagree."
Suns could use a Terry Taylor / Daniel Oturu
"Yeah, the pipeline has been insane in the last 10 years or so for high level college guys with a lot of draft picks thrown in.  You’ve had Tyus, Tre, and Gary Trent out of Apple valley, Rashad Vaughn, Daniel Oturu, Matthew Hurt (super highly rated prospect but left duke early and is stuck in the G league), Zeke Nnaji, Holmgren and Suggs out of v, JP Macura who was a stud at Xavier, Freddie Gillespie and Kendall Brown out of east ridge, Tyrell Terry, Royce White (who flamed out), McKinley Wright, Jericho Sims. Minnesota has had a 5 star I think every year for the last 10 years.    Lot of good woman players as well most notably Page Beuckers who’s at UConn now"
