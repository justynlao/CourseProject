Let me introduce you to Bruno Fernando
I'd so much rather have Dedmon than Bruno Fernando
Hawks young guys made too many mistakes and Bruno Fernando had no business being out there in the 4th.  I know Okongwu is hurt but fuck that was frustrating last night lol
Inversely it was painfully obvious who the lowest +/- on Hawks was....  Bruno Fernando is very not good as a backup 5
"Injuries have killed us, damn Bruno Fernando shouldn't even be in the league let alone getting 12 minutes against the Lakers."
Bruno Fernando shouldn't have an NBA contract
Cam played great defense on Lebron but some bad plays and poor coaching choices screwed us. Bruno Fernando playing 12 minutes against the Lakers should not happen. If Hunter wasn't injured I could see this game having been closer. We didn't do too bad.
Anyone want to trade for Bruno Fernando?  He's good I swear just avoid watching this game pls thx.
Hawks really lost because of Bruno Fernando
LMAO BRUNO FERNANDO
Everybody about to learn about Bruno Fernando 😤
Frank Vogel delighted at the sight of Bruno Fernando on the court instead of Clint Capela
"Im pretty sure at one point last year I had to watch a lineup of Jeff Teague, Vince carter, Deandre Bembry, Bruno Fernando, and Damian Jones"
"Guys, there are multiple rumors going around that the hawks are getting Anthony Davis for Bruno Fernando"
"That's because we now have an NBA center in Capela and (had) possibly the best backup 4 in the NBA in Gallo. Last year John was getting minutes over the corpse of Vince Carter, Damion Jones, Jabari Parker and Bruno Fernando. He absolutely should be getting less minutes now that we have a better roster to feed."
I dream of a day where we are not forced to play Bruno Fernando
"Not OP, but we didn't have  Bogdanovic - Starting SG  Rondo - Backup PG  Gallinari - 6th man with starter minutes  OO - Rookie big man at a very thin position for us  Dunn - 3rd String PG  If all our guys were healthy, Bruno Fernando, Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, and Brandon Goodwin would probably be g leaguers, or at the very least like 2 of them.  Not comparable to yall, but stop acting like we're not dealing with injuries of our own. Yall got hit harder, but it can't be you're one big excuse."
"why don't the sixers have a g league?  you got beat by g leaguers brandon goodwin, nathan knight, and bruno fernando lol  nathan knight had 3 blocks but maxey's one was good too congrats  https://twitter.com/ATLHawks/status/1348767881820065793"
"I'd argue it's worse right now. Solomon Hill is our 7th man right now, and he's filling in for center at times. 2nd year Cam Reddish is our 6th. Not sure who's up behind them. Brandon Goodwin? Bruno Fernando? one of our 2-ways?   Last season, we at least had Teague and Dedmon as 6th and 7th guys."
Bruno Fernando.  Bhahhaha.
I know its *only* the Knicks but this is a must-win for Hawks. Our roster isn't recovering from Thanos' snap any time soon and we just lost 2 games by 5 points or less and were pretty frustrated by it.  No excuse of traveling b2b like we had with Cavs - whats left of the team is fully rested. I expect to see Nathan Knight if Bruno Fernando has another bad game.
Not sure about Luka but I can see a good chance that the following superstars stay:  * Trae Young * De'Andre Hunter * Cam Reddish * Bruno Fernando * Brandon Knight * Kevin Heurter * John Collins
Schlenk has hit on every pick except Bruno Fernando. And even he could become a backup center
Ready? Buddy it’s already happening. All will know of hawks legends Nathan Knight and Bruno Fernando
"Some observations from the game.   * Reddish struggled from the field for most of the game but his willingness to drive that he's developed helped him contribute to our offense by getting to the free-throw line. This is something that he's improved on big time from last year.   * We're very deep at the PG position, Goodwin came in today despite being our 3rd/4th string PG and contributed well in his minutes on the floor.   * Capela is getting back to playing the way we saw him play for Houston, he was fantastic today.   * Hunter has improved MASSIVELY from his rookie season. His improvement has gone under the radar a bit but his offensive game is so much more polished this season, and maybe most importantly he's playing with much more confidence than he did last season. I know he was described as a high floor low ceiling guy before the draft but I don't see any reason he can't develop into a really special player.   * We are DEEP. The only weaknesses on our bench are Bruno Fernando and Solomon Hill, and once Gallinari and Okongwu are back their roles will be reduced.   * At the end of the day the jury is still out on if this team is going to be good this season, but we're definitely going to be a lot of fun to watch."
&gt;Hox Bigs  Yeah The ghost of Clint Capela and Bruno Fernando are really scary
soooo how do they get replacements in during game day? Going to be Trae and Bruno Fernando when they can't find anyone
"LAL Caruso was a summer league guy in 2016, Kostas picked by us and traded for Shake Milton ATL Bruno Fernando was originally picked by us and traded to ATL"
Watching Bruno Fernando hurts my eyes.
I will always be mad that the Hawks didn’t take the hometown kid instead of Bruno Fernando. Anyone who watched him in college knew his offense was a project but the defensive versatility was so there.
Bruno Fernando + Brandon Goodwin
Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando would shut em down
Bruno Fernando makes me want to tear my eyes out when he plays
Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando can’t even catch the ball😂
Bruno Fernando wouldn’t be able to get 15 shots up with any of them having better than a 20% of going in
"Narrative? Bro, rotations are definitely different seeing as Bruno fucking Fernando isn't playing any more(Thank God), and the offense is definitely different since they're not just running high pick and rolls every possession anymore. Team has been playing way different since the coaching change"
Bruno Fernando
Could prime Kendrick Perkins make the league right now? Are you serious? Bruno Fernando is an NBA player right now so yes prime kendrick perkins could surely make a roster.
"LP was giving minutes to Bruno Fernando, one of the worst players in the league, over our first round pick onyeka okongwu. In a near 20 point blowout tonight Bruno was -19. That’s how much of a dipshit LP was. He should never get a head coaching job again."
Vuc for Bruno Fernando straight up
Nathan Knight should be playing over Bruno Fernando in the rotation from here on out. He’s just looked too good
Imagine playing Bruno Fernando for like 20 minutes against the Lakers (and all season) and benching Nathan Knight the whole game.
"So glad to see Nathan Knight go off. The Hawks sub loves him 'cause we usually win when he plays, but it is great to see him get real minutes and show up.  Side note: How in the fuck is Bruno Fernando that bad at basketball? -19 in 7 minutes while the Hawks won by nearly 20 points? He looks this bad basically every time that he plays"
Bruno Fernando -19 in a blowout win. I doubt we see him again with everyone healthy.
Bruno Fernando -19 in a blowout win. I doubt we see him again with everyone healthy.
Bruno Fernando is on the court everyone fuckin stay calm
we’ll give you bruno fernando for MPJ. bruno’s potential is sky high
Bruno Fernando
"Some dude got caught on the phone by his wife talking to Kristen and made up the name Kris Dunn to avoid the heat.  It's gotten way out of control at this point, but even if he's fictional he still has a more justified roster spot than Bruno Fernando."
ATL Legend Bruno Fernando and Skylar Mays
Crazy what can happen when your coach allows you to play and doesn't give all your minutes to bruno fernando
Bruno Fernando is a lot worse and definitely the worst in the league
"We said that last year as well as earlier this year when Bogi, Gallo, Hunter, and Reddish were all injured. We were playing Bruno Fernando fucing 20 minutes a game bro."
What are the chances that Bruno Fernando gets minutes😂
"Don’t know if I’m wrong, but he doesn’t Seem bad to me. Might be because our center rotation last year was Alex Len Damian Jones and Bruno fernando"
"Yeah, injuries alone would probably prevent some guys from playing. And to have a blowout that big that even a Bruno Fernando or a Jared Harper get off the bench is highly unlikely. But to have even 15 guys make their debut would be wild."
Alright bois. You know it’s time to turn the tv off when Bruno Fernando comes in
Bruno Fernando had -19 in an 18 pt win against Cleveland
Bruno Fernando   I actually don't know what he does well.  He plays basketball like he just got cut from the JV football team. He watches the other team get OREBs for 4 minutes and then is sweaty as fuck.
Bruno Fernando
He’s right. How about Bruno Fernando and all of our second round picks for AD and Bron
Atlanta are going to dust the cobwebs off Bruno Fernando just so he can foul Simmons 6 times in the 4th quarter.
"Between Skylar Mays, Nathan Knight, Bruno Fernando, and Kris Dunn, the Hawks have 24 chances to hack Ben Simmons."
Bro how the fuck did Bruno Fernando ever get minutes. GM's should watch these games and immediately remove LP from any coaching considering.
It's Bruno Fernando time.
"Man management - LP is a terrible man manager. Everyone of his players hated him. He lobbied to other coaches that Trae shouldn't make the all-star game. Told Trae to wait his turn when it comes to representing the U.S after Pop chose Derrick White over him. Publicly complained about how Trae draws fouls. It come out after his firing that Cam Reddish felt that he was being bullied by LP. John Collins asked for a bigger role in the offense and LP called him selfish. Players said he was unapproachable and regularly lobbied for change through his assistants.    Terrible rotations - For some reason he had a hard on for giving Bruno Fernando minutes even though everyone could see Bruno Fernando is a bonafide scrub and we have a Okongwu our 1st round pick who is 10x the player he is just sitting on the bench. Regularly ran out trash lineups for far too long. We'd be up big with 4 minutes left in the 3rd and down double digits with 8 minutes left in the 4th.    No schemes - He literally doesn't have an offensive or defensive scheme. His scheme was hope Trae puts up 40pts and 15asts.    Also Bogi's injury came back ahead of schedule after LP was fired. Take that for what you will. LP is a terrible coach and I hope any eastern team takes him and gives us free wins next season. We had 11 blown 4th quarter leads with LP and became the best 4th quarter team in the league with McMillan. LP doesn't know when to call timeouts, doesn't ever hold himself accountable and I genuinely can't think of one positive thing when it comes to LP's coaching."
My god fuck  NBA Finals promo gonna be Royce O'Neale vs Bruno Fernando at this point
"&gt; Bruno Fernando and skyler Mays are #1 and #2 in terms of defensive rating this year for us. Are they our two best defenders?  I mean they barely played, they have a super small sample size. They probably did defend well in their limited minutes but who knows what it would look like if they played 30 minutes per game.   Defensive stats aren't perfect but they aren't so bad that they show great defenders as horrible ones and vice versa."
Bruno Fernando and skyler Mays are #1 and #2 in terms of defensive rating this year for us. Are they our two best defenders? you already said you haven’t watched him play this season and it shows if you think Solomon hill starting 3 games for us this series is better than reddish.
Pierce did some amazing things in the Atlanta community that I’ll always be thankful for but the dude was a terrible coach. From shit talking Trae to other coaches and playing Bruno Fernando heavy minutes he was awful in that aspect
"Yall werent saying that last year knocking on trae for missing playoffs with VC, Bruno Fernando, Evan Turner, Damion Jones getting huge minutes 🤔"
"I mean, Bruno Fernando was just sitting there, how could LP *not* play him??"
S/O dude with the Bruno Fernando jersey in the crowd
Unfortunately Bruno Fernando really is a hawks player
Haha you fools! You’ve activated our trap card: Bruno Fernando!! 😎
Bruno Fernando. Remember that name. He’s coming in to enforce.
Bruno fernando 🤮
I hope Jalen smith and Bruno Fernando turn out.
Rooting for the hawks now since they have huerter and the goat bruno Fernando
Will trade bruno Fernando for Joel Embiid. Will throw in Solomon Hill and a 2nd to be nice...

"Bruno ""human victory cigar"" Fernando time"
"I don't want to see Trae or any other starter being a knucklehead.  If Solomon Hill or Bruno Fernando want to throw hands though, I'll cheer them on."
"The Hawks have played 14 of 15 guys.  Everyone but our team mascot, Bruno Fernando.  Not a significant difference there."
Is it Bruno Fernando time yet?
Bruno “The Human Victory Cigar” Fernando incoming
Bruno Fernando the Human Victory Cigar is being taken out of the humidor as we speak.
Randle literally looks like Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando is disappointed in your lack of faith
Bruno Fernando would like to speak with you
Bruno Fernando is the best player in the series.
&gt;Bruno Fernando   Dreams cant be buy
Anyone here to give me insight on Bruno Fernando ?
"Now I'm just picturing the Hawks squad lined up on the baseline holding whistles and quivering, while Nate counts down from 10 in anticipation of the players all having to swallow said whistles.  Trae is crying, John Collins is getting more convinced that it's time to leave, Lou is coating his in hot sauce, and Bruno Fernando isn't sure what's going on."
"For the Hawks it’d likely be:  Protected:  * Trae, Capela, Collins, Hunter, Huerter, Bogi, Okongwu, Reddish  Draft Eligible:  * Gallo, Goodwin, Bruno Fernando, Mays and Knight  Lou and Snell are FAs this year. I went back and forth between Gallo and Cam for the last spot of protected because outside of his defense, Cam was bad this year. But his rookie contract and team control outweighed Gallo’s offensive production and current contract, given that its short term after this season (next season is guaranteed, then $5M guaranteed in the last year) and would free up cap space in the short-term."
"Closing out games: We had I think 10+ blown 4th quarter leads under LP  Better offensive scheme: McMillan started using Bogi as a ball handler and offensive playmaker more. LP had him mostly sitting in the corner as a spot up guy. Couple other adjustments as well like taking any kind of ball handling away from Gallo. Stopped giving Bruno Fernando minutes and gave them to Nathan Knight instead.  Belief in players: I didn't put a bunch of belief in this at the beginning of the season but it has become apparent that a lot of players, notably Trae and Collins, did not like LP as coach. They didn't like they way that he refused to give the players credit when they did something well. The change in coaching philosophy under McMillan lead to more even play by the team as the started gaining more confidence."
Bruno Fernando
"Remember the minutes Bruno Fernando got, omg"
Bruno Fernando
Trade Steph curry and klay Thompson to the hawks for Brandon Goodwin and Bruno Fernando
uhhh bruno fernando?? 🙄
Put Bruno Fernando in you coward
"OO has been great, especially during these playoffs. After being injured to start the year, playing behind clint capela, and having a coach for half the year who played him behind bruno Fernando for some reason, he's finally been giving a chance and has shown great promise."
"Is Bruno Fernando healthy and suited up? At this point you can't still be playing Okongwu, the man fumbles every time the ball gets to him and then gets bodied on the other end of the floor."
"It's nuts how deep the Suns roster is. They have great flexibility across positions and can withstand missing key contributors if needed. They had 9 players play major minutes this off-season so far: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Crowder, CP3, Payne, Cam Johnson, Craig, and Saric. And even beyond that, they have guys who could act as a solid stopgaps, with Nader returning halfway through the off-season, E'Twaun Moore, Kaminsky, and Jevon Carter (surprised he didn't get more time). The only real role they don't have redundancy is at center, where Saric (and maybe Crowder) could play small ball 5 but it's better if he doesn't do it for too long. Luckily, Ayton's been healthy and great in the playoffs. Payne has filled in for CP3 decently, Booker's scoring could be covered piecemeal (with drawbacks of course), and they have solid defenders across the board, especially at the wing.  I think this is a big difference between the Suns and Hawks roster construction with say, the Jazz or the Bucks. Bucks sacrificed their depth for Holiday and losing Donte (and now, Giannis) hurt them a disproportionate amount. Losing a role player (or even a star) in this injury-filled playoffs impacts a deep team a lot less, and teams with players on great contracts (both the Suns and Hawks have most of their important players on rookie contracts) can take more blows to their roster. For the Jazz, the top 8 played great but Niang and below couldn't be trusted and there wasn't lineup flexibility (no viable small ball 5, much less playmaking once Conley got hurt, worse scoring by quite a bit if Mitchell sits). Even the Clippers, who lost Ibaka before the playoffs started, Kawhi halfway through, and finally Zubac, played hard and stayed competitive up until they lost too many players because they had a really deep roster, too (and Mann stepped up).  Getting solid performers for cheap also helps a lot. The Suns got Torrey Craig for literally just cash and a TPE. Decent end of bench options are all on mins (or close to it): Payne, Nader, Moore, Galloway, Kaminsky, and Craig. Ayton's still on his rookie contract. Crowder at &lt;$10M/yr is a steal.   For the Hawks, Trae, Hunter, Reddish, Collins, Huerter, and Okongwu are all looking great and on rookie contracts, giving them plenty of cap to sign decent vets  like Gallo, Bogdan, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. (Also, that's 11 solid options most teams would be happy to have in a playoff rotation, hence why they could weather injuries to Trae, Hunter, Reddish, and Bogdanovic so far.)  For both these teams, they have very few wasted roster spots. The Suns' worst player at the moment is probably Jalen Smith, while the Hawks have Bruno Fernando and Brandon Goodwin. (Heck, Mays and Knight are solid.) Still, they take up very little cap. Goes to show how far prudent cap management can go.   TL;DR: James Jones and Travis Schlenk did a great job with these rosters."
Bruno Fernando was good his rookie year smh
"The Hawks have Bruno Fernando, checkmate."
LP was playing Bruno freaking Fernando over OO. If that doesnt tell you he's a terrible coach idk what will.
Bruno Fernando aka the human victory cigar
Bruno Fernando is playing tho
Better put some respect on Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando throws it down!
That's a weird way to say Bruno Fernando. Regional dialect?
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
I wanted a Giannis vs Kawhi finals not Bruno Fernando vs Abdel Nader
Put in Bruno Fernando now!!!
"I’ll give Bruno Fernando for him, maybe if they throw in a second"
The disrespect to Bruno Fernando smh
I WANT BRUNO FERNANDO MINUTES
Simmons for Bruno Fernando.
Give me Bruno Fernando on a rookie deal
Gotta throw my boy Bruno Fernando in there
Bruno Fernando unleashed in the CBA would be beautiful to witness
Bruno Fernando there
"Yes. Sadly I think the Hawks will have no choice but to cut Trae at this point, it is clear he is nothing but a liability. Bruno Fernando will be our starting PG from now on."
Dude imagine letting Bruno Fernando go +7. Huge L
"Lead was 40 when the starters came out, now its only 35. Clearly we need to start Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn next game, its the only way to win this series"
"""Please go easy on us Bruno Fernando!"""
Not sure how demoralized they'd be if you beat up on Bruno Fernando and Skylar Mays
Imagine paying hundreds of dollars for playoff tickets to see Jeff Teague going up against Bruno Fernando
BRUNO FERNANDO OFF THE BENCH FOR A REASON OTHER THAN A FIGHT
Bruno Fernando sounds like someone who should be playing in the midfield for Barcelona
HOX LEGEND BRUNO FERNANDO HAS RISEN
Bruno Fernando revenge game for his 1 game suspension.
I wore my Hawks Bruno Fernando jersey for game 1. Wearing my Giannis jersey today.   I’ll continue to alternate until game 7 and then sell my services to the highest bidder. I do it for the people.
"Luckily Travis Schlenk has shown that he is a draft genius. He has hit on almost every single first round pick in the last few years, except for Tyler Dorsey and Bruno Fernando. So we will most likely continue to get impactful players through the draft in future years."
Patrick McCaw &gt; Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando &gt; Tony Parker
"Of course we're losing, where the hell is Bruno Fernando"
"&gt; If Luka was in the East he would have been in the finals **last year**.  This is peak /r/NBA right here.  I'm betting you have absolutely no idea who was on the Hawks roster last year.  Luka would not have made the playoffs in the East with that roster.  &amp;nbsp;  The center rotations were Dedmon, Bruno Fernando, Alex Len, and Damian Jones.  None of those guys can even get minutes today.  We also started 2 rookies, Reddish and Hunter.  Hunter was bad last year, Reddish was bad to mediocre at times.  Heurter was our starting SG, good for about 12 ppg on terrible efficiency.  Our most seasoned player, 3rd year Collins, was suspended for 25 games.  &amp;nbsp;  Round off our rotation with Jabari Parker, Bembry, and Vince Carter chucking his way into retirement and you think that Luka instead of Trae is going to the finals lmfao this sub really never misses"
Yeah I dunno broski I think BRUNO FERNANDO is gonna give em a run for their money next season for MIP 😎
"His average over the last 3 years would probably be 1 assist higher if he wasn't passing to the all-NBA center rotation of Alex Len, Bruno Fernando, and Dewayne Dedmon"
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner.

I’ll take bazemore and Bruno Fernando over Nique Pettit and Trae any day
"Damn, imagine losing to the Hawks without Bruno Fernando"
And Atlanta did this withour Bruno Fernando.  Imagine if he wasnt suspended.
"Lmao I’m basically a Huerter spam account. Just wait for if Bruno ever gets minutes.   I got a Hawks Fernando jersey in my closet just waiting to be unleashed.   Stix in the WCF too, what a time."
And they did this without Bruno Fernando? Smh
Without Bruno Fernando I wasn't sure the Hawks would be able to take the game but I'm glad to see they rallied and got the win regardless
"Put in Bruno Fernando, McMillan!  It unlocks Huerters final form, they get the dynamic duo boost"
"DeAndre Hunter, Cam Reddish, and Brandon Goodwin are hurt. Bruno Fernando was Suspended. If Bruno was able to go, it would be a blowout."
I think it’s more impressive that we’re winning without my lord and savior Bruno Fernando
Hawks up 2 at the half even without Bruno Fernando...
How tf are we winning without star player Bruno Fernando!
I took Bruno Fernando getting playing time at +100000.
If we lose this just know it’s only because we are missing Bruno Fernando
Not sure what the hawks will do without Bruno Fernando aka the Angolan absentee bit it should be a good game. Back to you Cotton
Have a feeling Bruno Fernando is going off this game
can't wait to watch my favorite player Bruno Fernando
"I’ll do you one better, why is Bruno Fernando?"
To be fair I couldn't identify Bruno Fernando either.
"In all of the NBA 2K games I would always start an association and make sure Bruno Fernando was my franchise player. I would always put him as starting PF and change his number to #1 so he got a confidence boost for thinking he was the number one. Everyone else in the world takes him for granted and calls him overhyped, lazy, and fat, but I appreciate what he brings to my teams. I'd like to think the real Bruno Fernando sits in his hotel room at night, during his usual NBA travels from city to city, and looks out his window across the cityscape and into the dark night and bright moon and knows how I truly feel about him. He sheds a single tear and looks down and whispers ""Thanks brandon"". Every player has an entourage or group of friends and guys that follow them around but if you Google ""bruno fernando entourage"" you just get a bunch of pictures of him alone. Even one pic of him sitting in a hoodie holding a jar of mayonnaise like some sad joke. If you Google ""Bruno Fernando girlfriend"" you get a suggestion to search for Mike Conley instead, just because they kinda look the same. Even though he's mostly a bench and roleplayer, I still want to tweet to him ""good effort!"" after every game to build him up. My heart bleeds for Bruno Fernando."
"If Bruno Fernando isn’t playing game 7, is there really any point of watching? On a side note, who the hell is Bruno Fernando???"
Maryland legend Bruno Fernando
"The NBA suspended Bruno Fernando, who walked into the court from the bench and didn't escalate things.  The NBA did not suspend Harrell, who ran across the court to drive lay out Payne and escalated things.  Kinda brain-dead, but I guess one has a clear-cut rule and the other doesn't"
Who the hell is Bruno Fernando
Tf is a Bruno Fernando?
Bruno Fernando: Why you gotta pick on me?
"Yeah (also Bruno Fernando, but he's also kinda bench mode)"
The only person who for sure I can identify is Bruno Fernando so he can get suspended idc and maybe Hill or Knight as well. And both of them barely play as well so fuck it suspend them all. It’s game 7 and the starters should all be playing 40 minutes+ in it anyway
Bruno Fernando who is barely even on the team lmao
I dont think we will be saying we were robbed when Bruno Fernando doesn't get to play in game 7 so I think you'll be fine lol
Thought that was Bruno Fernando but I’m wrong I guess
"Indeed, Bruno Fernando."
oh no bruno fernando and khris dunn w.e shall they do
"Probably Bruno Fernando, but he wasn't seeing PT anyway"
The hawks will be missing Bruno Fernando and the 6 fouls he had available to use on Ben Simmons
"Yes! Impact player Bruno Fernando! Big loss for them, you guys have game 7 in the bag!"
"Our secret weapon, Bruno Fernando, might be. Sixers are lucky, he's a monster"
"Their worst player, Bruno Fernando will most likely get a game suspension"
Is this where Bruno Fernando being suspended and the 6 fouls of his they won't have is going to change the series?
without bruno fernando they may be doomed
BRUNO FERNANDO CUT THE LIGHTS OUT.
"Oh no, no Bruno Fernando? Anyway"
What would the Hawks do without Bruno Fernando for their next game??
They ejected bruno Fernando it's over
oh no not Bruno Fernando
nobody cares about bruno Fernando
"Welp, if the Hawks lose this game it’s over. No Bruno Fernando to bail them out in Game 7."
"Bruno Fernando, possibly getting suspended for game 7. Tragic, disastrous."
Oh no whatever will they do without Bruno Fernando.
OH NO NOT BRUNO FERNANDO!
Oh no the Hawks gonna lose Bruno Fernando for game 7 what are we gonna do
Who's Bruno Fernando? Lol
Ahh yes. Hawks legend bruno Fernando
Oh no they won't have Bruno Fernando next game
Bruno Fernando 😂
Bruno Fernando? He looked good for the Celtics summer league I think he’ll make the roster
bruno fernando... rip 😔
Bruno Fernando is an animal. Terp great too.
"Trae averaged 8.2 APG his rookie year with a big rotation of Dewayne Dedmond, Alex Len, 2nd year John Collins, and Omari Spellman. Averaged 9.3 APG his second year with a big rotation of Bruno Fernando, John Collins, Jabari Parker, Damien Jones, and Alex Len. He's a better passer than Luka. Luka is still a better overall player, but passing in particular Trae is better."
Hox  G: Jeremy Lin  G: Hanno Möttölä  F: Carmelo Anthony  F: Skal Labissiare  C: Bruno Fernando
Bruno Fernando.   Lost but not forgotten
ya sorry i'm sure Bruno Fernando is gonna do it for em
"Kornet is gone, Bruno Fernando is in. Dunn is probably going to be traded, hopefully Edwards too. It would be cool to see Madar stick stateside and may happen if shedding Dunn and Edwards. Boston needs a true 4 though, better than Williams and Parker."
That Bruno Fernando + Jaylen Smith front court for Maryland was pretty damn good. That was a fun pair...
TIL there is an active NBA player from Angola (Bruno Fernando with the Celtics). I wonder how he feels about Angola sometimes being the punchline of an NBA/Dream Team joke. Though I suppose he's too young to really care.
"Ok this is kinda wrong.   - Danny traded Kanter and the 30th pick for two future seconds. 30th was Bane.  - Danny signed TT. He under performs.  - Brad becomes GM - Brad traded TT in exchange for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a future 2nd. The Celtics DID NOT use a pick to dump TT, they actually got a pick for him.  - Brad signed Kanter for the veteran minimum.   Still pretty dumb, but not what OP said it was."
Hey Bruno Fernando is pretty good in 2k
Acquiring Bruno Fernando should be plenty to worry about in itself
I’ll never forgive Schlenk for trading Bruno Fernando 😭😭😭😭😭
"This is [the trade](https://i.imgur.com/DTigGSZ.png) that will reportedly land us Delon Wright in exchange for Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando and a 2023 SRP"
"Ok, once it's a done deal, we'll send you Bruno Fernando and Grant Williams."
I beg of you to look up Bruno Fernando tape from the last season or two. You'll be shocked at how he can be in the wrong place every single second he is on the court.
Bruno Fernando to the Celtics too
You may have Bruno Fernando
Now that Bruno Fernando got traded the runs over
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
who the fuck is bruno fernando and should i care
"&gt;How this will change the terms of the deal is unknown. Boston can fit the 2021-22 salaries of both Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando into the Kemba Walker TPE. That would create a $9.7M TPE for Tristan Thompson.  &gt;All three teams have engaged on expanding the deal too. Now, it's TBD!  [follow up](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1422046080510930944)"
"Bruno Fernando is complete trash, not just trash"
"Next are you going to tell me, Bruno Fernando is better?"
The Bruno Fernando era is upon us. Embrace it.
Fun fact: Kevin Durant has never scored over Boston center Bruno Fernando.
"Moses Brown and Bruno Fernando, apparently"
Yeah he probably posted Bruno Caboclo or something instead of Fernando guessing from the 2 years away jokes
BRUNO FERNANDO
Now they’re saying…it’s Bruno Fernando! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Al Horford/Robert Williams/Moses Brown/Bruno Fernando
Well have I got news for you regarding Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn lmao
That's Bruno caboclo Bruno Fernando is two years away from getting punted off the Maine red claws
“why does atlanta do this?”  guys Okongwu is out til like February lol. We have no center depth. Kris Dunn is bad Bruno Fernando is very bad  “TT is small can he really be ur center” idk Okongwu is like 6’9 bro!
Bruno Fernando. Crazy we gave up like 3 or 4 second rounders for him. Really thought he’d be a great bench big
With Bruno Caboclo? Surely he means Fernando?
Hawks should be all over this…need someone with legit size off the bench that’s not Bruno Fernando
"Yea people acting like Culver was going to be shit all along is funny. At the time the debate was between who out of him Hunter and Reddish you’d want to draft to be your wing player of the future in the 4-7 range and every mock was different with one being picked above the others and in different orders. I still think he can figure it out at some point, his 3 ball may never come but he could be a derozan type player with enough work. Culver for a second round pick and Bruno Fernando, who says no?"
zion for bruno fernando say yes now
That's debatable but yeah Bruno Fernando was a fringe All Star
"I’ll trade Bruno Fernando for Luka  Really though, I think this argument is dumb. The NBA is all of the best basketball players in the world. If there were more nba worthy white players the league wouldn’t be 75% black. If a player is incredible at basketball they’ll make the NBA, it’s just that there are more black people who are incredible at basketball than white people."
"Smart - Richardson - Brown - Tatum - Horford  Bench is Schroder, Rob Williams, Pritchard, and then after that it’s really going to depend on matchups. Some nights it could be Nesmith and Hernangomez, other nights could be Kanter and Langford. I assume Grant Williams, Jabari Parker and Bruno Fernando will be getting minutes if we have injuries or need to rest guys during the season.  I only say Rob Williams off the bench because of injury concerns and I assume he will be starting by the playoffs or at least seeing a significant increase in minutes as the year goes on, similar to last year."
"Clippers are better than the Knicks, sure.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Utah is better then the Heat  I ruled it as a tie, and I disagree. But, even if we roll with this, the result still doesn't change.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Mavs won both games against the Celtics last season, so no the east isn't better  The Mavericks won by 3 and 5 points respectively.  The Mavericks one key weakness was ballhandling to back up Luka. It's why they lost, Luka got gassed. They didn't fix it. They also replaced Carlisle with JASON KIDD. They did add Bullock and Sterling Brown and.... Moses Brown.  Celtics got versatile Al Horford who backs up the injury prone Williams, Bruno Fernando, Enes Kanter, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and most notably, Dennis Schroeder.  I'm takin the C's on this one. So, no, you're wrong."
"Sry for the homer but im gonna bet $1k on the Hawks over.    1. Hawks were one of the most injured teams last year - our only injuries this year will be Okongwu for half the year and Hunter for maybe a few games.   2. Coach change turned around almost every team stat 180 degrees   3. Young players will at least get slightly better   4. We lost Tony Snell, Bruno Fernando, Brandon Goodwin, Nathan Knight (one 9th man + g-leaguers) for Delon Wright, Dieng, and 2 solid rookies.    All this and we are only set to get roughly the same record as last year (last year we had 41 wins in a 72 game season)..? Easy money here."
"Trae was averaging 9,3 assists the year before with John Collins suspended for 25 games at the start of the season with Alex Len, Damian Jones and Bruno Fernando as his bigs.  Basically the type of bigs he has is irrelevant to how good of a passer he is"
Bruno Fernando slander will not be tolerated on this sub.
lol why include Bruno Fernando?
This man just said Bruno Fernando 😂
"You should have left Langford and Grant Williams off your list, they hurt your case more than help it. And Bruno Fernando is a Hawks castoff."
Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Robert Williams III  Payton Pritchard  Aaron Nesmith   Romeo Langford  Grant Williams   Uhh Carsen Edwards / Bruno Fernando   Certainly gives the Hawks a run for their money
Here's the list from last season.  DeMarcus Cousins  Andre Drummond  Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond  DeMarcus Cousins  Gorgui Dieng  Cristiano Felício    Gorgui Dieng  Andre Drummond   DeMarcus Cousins  Dewayne Dedmon   Nikola Jokić  Kelly Olynyk  Bam Adebayo   Steven Adams  Khem Birch    Kelly Olynyk                                   Jeff Green            Bruno Fernando  Jahlil Okafor
Yeah but we lost team mascot Bruno Fernando…
I still get nightmares from the Lloyd Pierce and Bruno Fernando days but those days are over. God is great
Legend has it that the absence of Bruno Fernando on the team has dissatisfied the fans
Hawks making it easy by not starting Huerter and trading Bruno Fernando.
Imagine Bruno Fernando and Grant Williams beating you out for a roster spot
"Damn, I loved watching him at the Olympics.   Wish the Celtics could find a way to move off Bruno Fernando and sign Exum or even Harry Giles to vet mins."
Delon is like 3 tiers better than Bruno and Kris Dunn because he is a very average rotation level player who doesn’t have multiple massive holes in his game. Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando don’t get rotation minutes on like 27 out of 30 teams
"we fleeced Delon for him and Bruno Fernando, how does Schlenk keep getting away with it man"
Feels like yesterday I was telling people Bruno Fernando would be the next Clint Capela. I stand by that take 🐢
Could be Bruno Fernando
"A bunch. Played against KAT a few times back in the day, him and his family were great. He played alongside Wade Baldwin, who actually got ejected when we played him and we thought was pretty overrated but we ended up reconnecting a few years later and laughed about the whole thing.  Worked at a hotel that hosted the NBA Rookie Symposium in 2016. Served Ben Simmons, he very much kept to himself and didn’t socialize like everyone else. Buddy Hield gave me a free speaker, shirt, bags, etc. because “man we got money we don’t need this” was super appreciative. Jamal Murray was my guy too, super nice. Did not like Taurean Prince because he was offended I didn’t know who he was and was kind of a dick (to be fair, I knew most of them, but like dude you’re Taurean Prince).  Went to college with Kevin Huerter, wasn’t super close but he used to hookup with my friend and we talked a few times, he’s pretty quiet and reserved but a good guy. Bruno Fernando was hilarious, we loved him."
"FINALLY, we've reached the Isaac Bonga/Bruno Fernando portion of the evening."
"Vince Carter, Evan Turner, Chandler Parsons, Treveon Graham, Tyrone Wallace, Allan Crabbe, Bruno Fernando, Damian Jones...do I have to go on?"
"In the Delon Wright trade to ATL.   Originally, ATL traded Bruno Fernando and Kris Dunn to the Celtics. ATL received Tristian Thompson. It became a three team trade which resulted in TT getting moved for Delon Wright."
"Marginal trades, but trading 3 2nd rounders for Bruno Fernando while also selling 2nd round picks that same year isn't great  Otherwise, in terms of trades Hawks have a pretty good 5 year track record."
I was actually talking about Bruno Fernando.
He got traded but it was Bruno Fernando
"Yeah you're right. Romeo Langford might become the GOAT. Bruno Fernando could become the next Kareem. You never know, right?"
I’ve always thought that Bruno Fernando has the “it” factor
Bruno Fernando😈
"he was traded there for kris dunn and bruno fernando, atlanta flipped him for delon wright"
"Lmao when we were running rotations of Bruno Fernando, Alex Len and Dewayne Dedmon Trae averaged 30-10. Trae can get lobs up to anyone even porzingis"
"Pacers get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Robert Williams  * Payton Pritchard  * Bruno Fernando (filler)   * 2021, 2023 Celtics 1sts  Celtics get:   * Malcolm Brogdon  * Domantas Sabonis  Celtics upgrade with great players in their prime. Brogdon/Smart/Tatum/Horford/Sabonis is really great and solves their ball movement issue.   Pacers retool to get younger and acquire a young star in Brown. Duarte/Brown/Levert/Turner/Williams is pretty great. Maybe move Turner for a PF that fits better. Could probably get KP and a couple picks from the Mavericks for him, for example."
"They aren’t the only ones, but more $ is more expectations. Boston fans don’t care as much if cheap guys like Schroeder, Bruno Fernando, Parker or Kanter suck rather than Tatum, Brown or Smart who’re getting the most suck."
"I watched a lot of BIG10 bc I like OSU, and when they had Bruno Fernando and Jaylen Smith they were scary AF. Too bad to see neither of them turn into a rotational player yet..."
"The closest he came to seeing the NBA this season is when Woj mistakenly tweeted that Bruno Caboclo was being signed by the Celtics, and then [corrected it to Bruno Fernando](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1421226542445760516?lang=en)."
In comes Bruno Fernando to hack Ben at the tip off
"Word after 2 years of watching us trot out Jabari Parker, Alex len, Damian Jones 43 year old VC, DeAndre Bemrby, Bruno Fernando and a bunch of rookies I don't want to hear shit about bad supporting casts lol."
"I replied to another person with this but;   Trae Young’s team mates by minutes played with  1.	⁠Hunter - Rookie 2.	⁠Huerter - 21 years old in year 2. Younger than Hunter 3.	⁠Reddish - Rookie 4.	⁠Collins - 22 years old, year 3 5.	⁠Jabari Parker - 24 years old, guy that doesn’t play defence and barley has a role in the league 6.	⁠Damion Jones - 24 years old - 3rd string Center caliber player 7.	⁠DeAndre Bembry - 25 years old, almost no offence. 10th man on most playoff teams 8.	⁠Alex Len - 26 years old. Was cut from the Raptors despite their biggest hole being the 5 9.	⁠Vince Carter - quite literally the oldest player in the history of the NBA this season 10.	⁠Bruno Fernando - Rookie  Trae had probably the worst supporting cast in the league last year."

The vets they did have were either guys fighting for roster spots that have been bouncing around teams, and 43 year old Vince Carter."
When Nate McMillan pulls out the secret weapon Bruno Fernando the hawks will become clear title favorites
