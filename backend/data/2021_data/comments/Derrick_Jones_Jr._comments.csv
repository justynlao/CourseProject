"&gt; NBA, MPJ, FVV, KD, THT, AD, AC, CP what's up with this?  Idk about you but those all instantly recognizable for me.  And typing out Derrick Jones Jr or Gary Trent jr takes forever"
"Who would win:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  vs.   Dame, GTJ, Hood(?), Covington, Kanter  With how CJ was playing, I honestly think that top team would win. Lol."
"Blazers hospital team:   CJ McCollum, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, Nassir Little  Luckily Roco is back from his concussion!"
There are so many complete and utter dogshit takes on this post. Holy shit. Some of you guys would rather have Derrick Jones Jr instead of Ayton.
"Ok first off, the portland trailblazers and Damian Lillard have a much better roster than the warriors right now. That's not a debate, the warriors have no depth.. Outside of their average starting five, they have one of the worst teams in the NBA.   So if we look at the team success so far, Steph Curry's warriors, who are a worse team than Lillard's blazers, are essentially tied in record (10-9,11-9). Don't underestimate that blazers team though. CJ McCollum is an all-star level player, he just hasn't had the appearances because the team he's on isn't usually high enough in the standings to warrant a #2 guy like McCollum to make it. Why are the blazers not usually higher in the standings then? It's not the coaching, Terry Stotts has built a great system. It's not the surrounding cast, the blazers have guys like Nurkic, Kanter, Trent Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Rodney Hood, and others in the past, etc... It's because Lillard is not good enough to push them to the next level. It's not always as easy as just putting up the numbers. It's the same reason why Harden, who puts up crazy numbers, hasn't had much team success. Both are not as efficient and don't affect the game in different enough ways to make up for that, unlike a guy like Lebron who does everything, or KD &amp; Curry who are extremely efficient."
Honestly I'd go Derrick Jones Jr. I love what he brings
"If we stayed healthy this year I think we could have swung for the fences.  CJ showing out, a staple of young talented guys(GTJ, Ant, Collins, Nassirl, Derrick Jones Jr).  But now I don't think it's realistic."

"Blazer fan here. We basically brought in Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr. to fill the vacated roles that Maurice Harkless and Al-Faruq Aminu filled during our WCF run a couple years ago. They are here to play good defense and if they can hit some shots on top of that great. Otherwise fine leave it to Dame, CJ, Gary and Melo. The more important and urgent matter other than Roco’s 3p% is the team health. Both Roco and DJJ are currently out with a concussion and a right quad contusion respectively. Hopefully we’ll get them both back in a week or two but we will still be missing Nurk and CJ for a while. To be clear Dame is literally our only healthy starter right now."
Gordon was unreal. Maybe had the best dunk in the contest. I personally argue that those are the two best individual dunk contest performances ever. They just happened to be the same year. Gordon did get robbed against Derrick Jones Jr. though. Fuck that one.
"Derrick Jones Jr. is shooting 44% overall and 25.7% from 3.  And the 3s he's taking are WIDE OPEN.  As uneven as RoCo has been, DJJ has been significantly worse.  Same for Rodney Hood as he works his way back into form coming off the achilles injury."
"I see you Derrick Jones Jr!   He is our Dame on defense, doesn’t get enough credit."
Derrick Jones Jr.. i think
Derrick Jones Jr lol
"We’ve looked very good in parts of games and very bad in parts of games.   Defence has been an issue, Covington’s shooting has been awful and our bench is among the worst in the NBA  CJ and Nurk being out for an extended period of time is worrying  Derrick Jones Jr is fun when we get the ball to him in positions he can dunk from and CJ took a big step before his injury"
&gt;Elevator Mode  Derrick Jones Jr. Aka Airplane Mode
"No I'm saying you need to watch the game. The hawks were rotating off non-shooters. Guys like Covington were 1-13. And yes. Only Derrick Jones Jr on the team cuts on that team. You can't evaluate a play based on how you imagine a team should play, you have to watch the tape to see the actual defensive schemes and the offensive unit on the court."

Is your perimeter defense really that bad? Didn't you guys add Covington and Derrick Jones Jr?
"unlikely because despite his struggles I still think Nurk is value+ for this Blazers team, also because Kanter is bad and Giles is still pretty unproven as a player that can absorb any kind of significant minutes.  I will be intrigued to see if this results with more small ball featuring Covington/Derrick Jones Jr. as a nominal 5 and then a bunch of wings &amp; guards around that.  They won't stop anyone, but they already weren't so might as well lean into the offense &amp; go full micro-ball."
"Lamelo Ball is listed at 6 foot 8. Chris Boucher is listed at 6 foot 9.  His last game against Portland. He had 3 blocks. One on Enes Kanter, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Jones Jr. none of whom are 5"" shorter.  The last block he had on anyone more than 5"" shorter than him was his last block in Golden State on Steph Curry."
"He’s not the most by any means, but Derrick Jones Jr. looks pretty damn versatile"
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
Derrick Jones Jr has an absurd finish once a week I swear
Derrick Jones Jr. is Crash Wallace 2.0
"Vanderbilt is probably the best we have and odds are he might crack the starting lineup soon.   It was a known issue this roster is missing a 4. We tried to get Millsap, JaMychal Green, Derrick Jones Jr, and Jae Crowder in free agency. Some we couldn't afford but others just chose other teams. We've also been rumored to be probing trades for PJ Tucker, Larry Nance Jr, and Aaron Gordon.  Our GM has been trying but not much has come our way."
"Rodney Hood, Jusuf Nurkic, Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Collins, all the draft picks for Harden.  Dame/CJ/Harden + RoCo and Kanter/Giles starting and backing up the 5."
he getting double figures  Derrick Jones Jr got $10m and he’s probably worse tbh (and older)
Just watched the tape he is a very good ball handler. Would have thought we was just a Derrick Jones Jr type off ball rim runner

Derrick Jones Junior has played great defense as well as Gary Trent Jr and ...well that’s about it but RoCo and Nurk should be better by February is my guess
"Never happening but the salaries necessary to match would probably be Derrick Jones Jr. and Collins. I don't think that's valuable enough for the Warriors so they'd have to include some combo of picks, Anfernee, and/or Gary Trent Jr. So yeah, they'd give up depth but they'd still have a solid top 8 in their rotation.   Regardless, this is never happening."
When they are eligible to be dealt Rodney hood and Derrick Jones Jr would get you fairly close salary matching wise probably just need one more minor salary to match depth would survive I think. Now whether GSW would have even the faintest interest in that package even if you attach a 2023 and 2025 first.....that’s a separate story
No but we’ll Derrick Jones Jr off your hands
Melo has a .580 TS% this season on only 20% usage this season. Trent has .590 TS% on 19% usage. Both are doing their roles fine and Melo is only getting 3 more min this season. Real question is why the fuck Derrick Jones JR is averaging 30+ mins a game on 32% shooting.
"Derrick Jones Jr. missed a lot of free throws. Those were crucial free throws, because Bulls were coming back in the game."
"Derrick Jones Jr., please don't ever get old"
Great clutch shots from Lavine and Lillard. Trail Blazers defence sucks even though they traded for Covington and Derrick Jones Jr.
my goodness derrick jones jr. ✈️✈️✈️
If he puts together any kind of offensive game he'd be a very good asset to any team. Extremely adept defender and has a decent handle for his size. Depending on the development of his shot he could fill a role similar to Jerami Grant or Derrick Jones Jr.
"No, I pointed out that your implication skipped over Kevin Durant being part of that team. Which is a pretty important thing to skip over basketball-wise. Insane to miss out even.  (And of course before Durant you had the time when Draymond wasn't an awful at 3pters, or when Barnes was shooting in the high 30%s from 3. If part of this hypothetical is that Derrick Jones Jr suddenly starts knocking down 3s at high efficiency then I'm all behind it)."
Stan has used Zion like hes Derrick Jones Jr (without shooting) on offense.

that was derrick jones jr
Why did Derrick Jones Jr look so sad there.
"Derrick Jones Jr. has been tremendous for Portland this year without much of a jumper. Al Farouq Aminu has been a very impactful player for both us and Portland in the playoffs (granted he has managed to shoot better in the playoffs though on low volume). Shaun Livingston was great for the Warriors too. High IQ players who are good at defense will still be impactful players in the playoffs, especially one who can get to the line."
I mean it was pretty good just a few years ago with Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon. And Derrick Jones jr. this year was just a weird one that not even kids would find entertaining I think. For all the old heads out there.. sorry nothing is going to top dunks like Jordan and VC. Cuz they did it first . But don’t cancel it the kids still like it and it’s still better than nothing
He had insider information from the former dunk contest champion of the world Derrick Jones JR
The dunk contest is dying. There isn’t really much you can do right now that hasn’t been done. Last year it got boring watching Derrick Jones Jr. do a between the legs dunk every time and win. Aaron Gordon truly got robbed. Maybe if he won he runs it back this year too. Going to take an extreme amount of creativity to keep it interesting year after year.
"But that's the point.  Wade took all the fun out of it because he ruined a great battle.  Other than that night I don't even really hear anybody shitting on Derrick Jones Jr.  I'm honestly not even sure most people remember who beat Gordon, they just remember D Wade giving him a 9."
"Aaron Gordon and Derrick Jones Jr were in a tie breaking round going back and forth at the end of the dunk contest.  The judging table was trying to extend it to go to another round, so they were going to give both guys the same score and just let the best dunk win.  Wade pulled a fast one on the table and gave Gordon a 9 so that Derrick Jones Jr could win because he played for the Heat (if you hear jokes about D Wade and the number 9, that's why).  He basically kinda just ruined everybody's fun by taking a tough competition and giving it to his guy (Derrick Jones Jr had great dunks too, but it was a sour ending).  Part of it was everybody wanted Gordon to win because he's one of the best to participate ever and hadn't won yet, but also just in general having the judging pan out like that got on people's nerves."
"No mention of the Blazers who have been playing without their 2nd and 3rd best players for most of the season? Plus another potential starter (Zach Collins) out for the season?  Blazers depth is the only reason they remain in the playoff hunt despite being the most injured team in the entire league. They will have a full 10 man rotation available again after the All Star break:  PG: Lillard, Anfernee Simons SG: CJ, Trent Jr. SF: Derrick Jones, Rodney Hood PF: Covington, Melo C: Nurkic, Kanter  And that's not including fast improving Nassir Little and out for the season Zach Collins. Little may be good enough to fight for the starting SF spot next season."
"Yeah he may not be Derrick Jones Jr. or anything but he's got ups for sure  My personal favorite dunk is the one he had against the mavs last year where he kinda half eurosteps from the FUCKING FREE THROW LINE and bodies maxi kleber  Even the mavs bench reacted a bit like ""holy shit where did THAT come from?"""
Derrick Jones Jr?
"They are total nobodies lol. And I thought Derrick Jones Jr, Hamidou Diallo, Glenn Robinson III, Pat Conaughton etc in recent years was bad..."
Duncan Robinson and Derrick Jones jr
Derrick Jones Jr. did it when he was on the Suns G-League team so why not
derrick jones jr in his rookie year.  The dunk contest is actually what allowed him to play.  He was moved up from the G League because of it.
"Derrick Jones jr - ""YALL CHEATING!!! YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT???"""
Yeah didn't they have a clip of Derrick Jones Jr too? Don't think it was meant to show only players playing in the all star game.
"Edwards, zion, bridges, toppin  i also wouldnt mind seeing if derrick jones jr could defend his title. I feel like you gotta let the defending champ defend his title."
"Suns starting lineup that game was Tyler Ulis, Book, Derrick Jones Jr (who I like a lot but he was very raw back then), Marquese Chriss (who I don't like a lot but was also incredibly raw) and Alex Len. 3 guys off the bench who got minutes were the corpses of Leandro Barbosa and Jared Dudley + Big Sauce (Alan Williams, my guy!)"
Derrick Jones Jr. and Gary Trent Jr.
Derrick Jones Jr is this way too but definitely not the player Lavine is obviously
"derrick jones jr, donovan mitchell?? jaren jackson jr??"
"It's more that he finished with his hand on the rim as opposed to the ""Griffin"" way of throwing it down without ever touching the rim, Derrick Jones Jr had one like that against the raps too iirc"
Neither top derrick jones jr against the raptors for me
Jae Crowder and Derrick Jones Jr. But that’s not the sole reason we suck this year
"His shooting was pretty poor early on in the season, but the past couple weeks he has been hitting 3s much more consistently. He has had a few decent nights of scoring, but nothing crazy. But we don’t really need him to score loads when we have Dame, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons and CJ when he is healthy.   I’m no expert, but in my opinion his defense has been massive for us. He has had some very very clutch steals and pokes, not many blocks. The combo of him and Derrick Jones Jr. has been a much needed boost all around defensively compared to last season. Those big wingspans get their hands on everything lol.   Overall I would say just about any Blazer fan you talk to would be very happy with the RoCo signing. We’ve always lacked defensive ability, but it’s been a lot better than last season imo."
I bet Derrick Jones Jr. is so good at hide-and-seek
"Not a 3&amp;D, but I always laugh whenever I see Derrick Jones Jr. play on this Blazers team. He's a ""Put Back &amp; D"" player. They just have him standing at the weakside corner on offense and his job is to just put back dunk all of Dame's missed 3s. The dude gets 30+ minutes a night just doing this and playing defense."
Nah he’s Derrick Jones Jr with a shoe deal
"The 1st in the East sixers lost to us without lillard, CJ, Nurk, Derrick Jones jr, Zach Collins, and nassir little"
I'm baffled that they continue to start Derrick Jones Jr.
We desperately need an athlete. I wish we had Derrick Jones Jr.

"“Fuck KP, all my homies hate KP”   -Derrick Jones Jr"
"Dame passes out of double teams just fine, typically the problems start whenever the dudes he's passing to try to do something with the ball.  It's hard for Dame &amp; CJ to make stuff happen when there's always an Evan Turner/Moe Harkless/Derrick Jones Jr. type out there that defenses don't have to respect."
"Ok, but this is all just a discussion of *scheme*. Rudy could be the most switchable defender in the NBA, but if he doesn't play on a team with a personnel that will facilitate him switching, then he won't switch. And when you look at the Jazz there are *maybe* two players in the rotation who could regularly switch onto Rudy's guy? The problem with Rudy in a switching defense isn't Rudy, it's the fact that *everyone else on his team is so much smaller than him* and can't replace the defensive presence he brings to the paint, where he's regularly asked to defend two or three guys at a time - and does so successfully. The Jazz have a lot of decent-to-great wing defenders (Bogdanovic, Ingles, O'Neale, Niang is a pretty solid rotation defensively), but *none* of those guys are equipped to protect the rim or seriously guard the five. And Conley and Mitchell shouldn't be guarding wing players at their size. Clarkson is a defensive liability.  Rudy *can* switch onto elite guards. He just *doesn't*, because if he switches onto elite guards, the Jazz don't have the defensive personnel to support him switching. Apart from Gobert, the Jazz are a pretty small team; their starting PF is only 6'4"". This is the reason why Gobert's defensive numbers in the clutch are [so fucking astronomical](https://www.ksl.com/article/46705809/rudy-gobert-has-been-the-leagues-best-clutch-player--another-reason-he-should-be-an-all-star); because those are the only time that coach Q says ""Hey Rudy, I'm putting you on their best guy"". Because when crunch time happens and everything is on the line, you'd rather lose to Derrick Jones Jr. or Daniel Theis than Dame or Tatum. [Just look at this play here](https://twitter.com/Chase_Observes/status/1210481904085950464?s=20): Dame has the ball with about 20 seconds left; Gobert is his primary defender, he runs Dame off the line, forces a pass out, and then the ball ends up in Melo's hands, which Gobert swats out of the air. The numbers back this up too - in the last two seasons, [Gobert has averaged 0.73 points per attempt on isolation attempts by guards](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208811329873530880) in switches, and that doesn't even capture the amount of times where a guard attempt an iso against Gobert and then thinks better of it and wisely ditches that idea instead.   But just to throw you a bone, here are a few clips of Rudy guarding players on the perimeter and generally doing a good job, in case the numbers aren't good enough for you.  [Rudy on Malcolm Brogdon](https://twitter.com/dsjenson/status/1219486493518913536?s=20)  [Rudy swatting Trae's iso attempt](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1208051219056300033?s=20).  [This play where he recovers from Austin Rivers' crossover and then fucking sends him to the shadow realm](https://twitter.com/griffdunk/status/1222233799729147904?s=20)  [Rudy Gobert stopping an iso attempt by Devonte Graham](https://twitter.com/Ben_Dowsett/status/1208810396787695616?s=20)  The problem isn't Rudy. The problem is that when Rudy leaves the paint, the entire defensive scheme collapses because Utah's scheme is built on two things: running guys off the 3pt line, and funneling them towards Rudy in the paint because he's basically the one of the greatest rim protectors that basketball has ever seen. And if he's not in the paint, there's nobody to rebound, there's nobody to box out, there's nobody to contest at the rim, which means that if a guy manages to get past his man (this will happen, sometimes Bogdanovic just gets cooked, or Mitchell has a defensive lapse), it's a free two points. And if Rudy leaves the paint, then the Jazz can't be as aggressive in closing out on 3's, because if they sell out too hard to contest, their guy will just drive to the rim and all of Utah will just have to pray that they blow a wide-open layup.  In essence, if the Jazz switch Rudy onto a perimeter guy, they're giving up a thousand free looks at the basket in order to shut down one guy from scoring. Sometimes, that's the right play to make. But for 99% of the game, it's way better to let Rudy camp in the paint and do the thing he's better at doing than basically anyone else in NBA history. Make people shit their pants when they get past their man, then put up an inefficient floater or fadeaway 2."
Derrick Jones Jr can still be charged with attempted murder right?

Does Derrick Jones Jr have a 3 ball?? I thought he was pretty much a non shooter
"&gt;: It's amazing how you can examplify what i was saying so effectively. On-off is more about who you play with then what you are contributing. As you explained so well.  It's amazing you can't understand the difference between on/off numbers between teammates and on/off numbers between #1 guys on different teams   &gt; ach Collins is poor often injured back-up center, the fact that you are counting him as a big ""missing piece"" kind of lets me know where you are at with this.   Bud I literally counted Dwight Powell.  And ""often-injured"" is hilarious when you're talking about Kristaps ""literally never finished a season healthy"" Porzingis.    &gt; Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Bottom line is that the blazers have been missing their 2nd AND 3rd best players for 12 out of the 23 games, have missed Zach Collins the whole season, and Derrick Jones Jr, Covington, Hood, Nassir, Anfernee have all missed more than one game.   &gt; to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Well that's just a flat lie because Tim Hardaway has literally played 24 games lmao.  They played maybe one game with no starters?  So same as us."
"I feel like there has to be somebody worse than Derrick Jones Jr at PF, not saying he's great at all"
"I think CJ is more consistent than Murray but they're in the same tier of player (you could argue that Murray's ceiling is higher).  Really what separates them for me are the other pieces, I think MPJ/Aaron Gordon/Barton/Morris are better than RoCo/Norm Powell/Nurkic/Kanter.     Also the Nuggets still have Millsap/Green/Dozier &amp; Facu, none of whom are amazing players but all of whom can at least give competent minutes on a regular basis (except maybe Dozier who is up &amp; down but I really like his energy &amp; potential).  Once you get past Nurkic &amp; Kanter for the Blazers there's Derrick Jones Jr. and then some really wild unknowns like Nasir Little &amp; Simons, you can't count on those guys when it matters in any kind of meaningful way."
Derrick Jones Jr dunks are pretty awesome
"Airplane Mode, Derrick Jones Jr."
"No.  There are some bench guys with athleticism and offensive creativity  who could make a splash in europe (Bledsoe, ennis, diallo, derrick Jones jr) but Muscala is the type of player you can find in Europe.    I saw a Madrid game live 4-5 years ago and the best players on the floor were rudy fernandez, sergio luell, roddy beaubois and sergio rodriguez.  Dudes like Muscala, kinda soft but pretty big and somewhat skilled, abounded."
Maybe Derrick Jones Jr? They’re both super athletic
Derrick Jones Jr next to patrick williams and vuc would be cool  Obviously all bulls fans want lonzo but maybe we can get lucky in the lottery and land suggs who knows.  DJJ has a player option and I don't think he starts anymore with powell being there so maybe he opts out. Now that we have vuc we need to surround zach and vuc with good defenders and a switchable aggressive forward like DJJ would be awesome. I'd much rather have him than lauri's weak ass getting embarrassed every game.
I think if he won it over Derrick Jones Jr. people wouldn't care.  In my eyes that was the worse robbery
Damn looks like Derrick Jones jr would beat Iverson in a 1 on 1 :(
"We need to figure out how to get Powell his corner 3's.  We're a really good 3 shooting team but pretty much all of ours come above the break(CJ, Dame, Roco all pretty much only shoot above the break 3's).  The only guy that gets corner 3's is Derrick Jones Jr, and he gets them for obvious reasons"
"Yes, it happens a ton and it has happened for years. The person you're taking the number from generally has to be a relatively unknown player where there aren't thousands and thousands of unsold jerseys of that player out there in the world.  Another example is Landry Shamet, it has happened to him twice. When Jimmy Butler came to Philly, Jimmy took Shamet's number 23 and Shamet switched to 5. When James Harden came to Brooklyn, Harden took Shamet's number 13 and switched to 20.  Edit: Derrick Jones Jr. just switched his number mid-season from #55 to #5. Rodney Hood had previously worn #5 but when he got traded away, Jones was allowed to switch to #5."
"Since 2011, the Jazz, Nuggets, and Blazers draft picks have combined for 13 all star appearances (Lillard 6, Jokic 3, Gobert 2, Mitchell 2). These 3 teams are considered by most to be in the range of ""fringe contenders"" to ""playoff lock but nothing more"". Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years (please let me know if I missed any notables. This was weirdly difficult to dig up.) :  * Evan Turner * Derrick Jones Jr. * Carmelo Anthony * Paul Millsap * Bojan Bogdanovic    Since 2011, the Lakers, Clippers, and Nets draft picks have combined for 3 all star appearances (D'Lo '19, Ingram '20, Randle '21), yet all 3 teams are championship contenders. Notable acquisitions via free agency in recent years:  * LeBron * Kawhi * KD * Kyrie * Blake Griffin * LaMarcus Aldridge * Serge Ibaka"
"And just to be clear on those teammates, he had:  - Tyler Ulis (2nd round rookie, now out of the NBA)  - Derrick Jones Jr. (undrafted rookie who had started 4 games to that point)  - Alex Len  - Marquese Chriss (rookie)  - Leandro Barbosa (last game of his career)  - Jared Dudley   - Alan Williams (undrafted second year player, now out of the NBA)"
"&gt; Everyone would (still) like to remind Aaron Gordon that they don't give a shit.  Seriously though, he probably did win the first one against Zach LaVine; it was close, but I suppose you *could* say he was robbed. But he most certainly was not robbed in the second one against Derrick Jones Jr."
"Kinda but not really. Melo legit seemed like he was out of the league in 2019, we can't forget that in his case.  For those who don't remember - he got his first minimum in houston after he got traded and bought out by atlanta (still his nyk max) after petty bad year in okc. That went terribly so he got dumped to Chicago and waived in February. An no one wanted him till November, when blazers had so many injuries that they took a non guaranteed flyer and it worked out.   But after that what can he get actually? Maybe taxpayer MLE (5.76 mil)? But that's mostly contenders who didn't want him before anyway. And portland spend theirs non taxpayer MLE (almost 10 mil) on derrick jones jr - and miami version of him is way better player than melo and way younger. So ye he's outperforming the minimum but it's not like he has much of a choice, he barely got back to the league once already and outside of wolves and blazers i fail to see team that could legit use his services."
Were Scottie pippen and Chadwick Boseman teammates with Derrick jones jr? Cause it wasn’t just Dwyane Wade who put up a nine
"The blazers big 4 consisting of Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones jr, CJ McCollum, and Robert Covington combined for 62!"
Derrick jones jr
"Chris ""Derrick Jones Jr"" Boucher"
"I don't understand how I'm seeing all these trade rumors for Portland talking about how they need to trade for a defensive player to help.  They added Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr in the off-season, two of the better wing/big hybrid defenders in the league.   They have also missed their defensive anchor (Nurkic) for most of the season.  Shouldn't they be focusing on what they do have versus what they don't?"
"They would need a roster on par with like the 2019 Raptors or current Jazz talent wise where 1-8 every dude is solid. Dame, Trent, CJ, Nurkic, Melo, and Covington are all solid. The Derrick Jones Jr role is the weak link, but he would be fine off the bench. Rodney Hood was also playing crunch time minutes for them and I just don't have much faith in him anymore. Even when Zach Collins is healthy he wouldn't be enough. They need defense. The dream replacement would be Draymond but that will never happen. The only hope would be to take a gamble on an Aaron Gordon type player or younger and hope you can turn them into Draymond lite. I don't see Dame and CJ breaking up either. It's not like CJ would fetch much. If you could replace CJ with like Gordon Hayward or Jaylen Brown that might help but again I would doubt that would happen. Maybe Myles Turner? But that may just create more problems."
"When you have to add a disclaimer about how they’ve been struggling without Davis, then it furthers the point that he’s not the MVP.   Dame has been without CJ and Nurk. He’s been carrying that team with the likes of Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons and Derrick Jones Jr (when he’s healthy).   I hate to even say it, but I’d put Harden ahead of LeBron as well given the fact that I think KD’s knee is a wee bit more problematic than the team is letting on."
"What about Derrick Jones Jr? Honestly he’s a dynamic player but how much value does he bring to our team that AG wouldn’t be able to offer? DJJ, and a pick?  I feel like we rarely make trades like this but I’m fully ok with losing Derrick for AG and a couple picks if necessary"
Roco and Derrick Jones Jr are both those tweener rim protector types who would be small forwards 20 years ago.
Derrick Jones Jr. I want bounce
"Blake, Zach Lavine, even LeBron have all been great in game dunkers post Vince.  Also Derrick Jones Jr. sometimes"
Are you under the impression that current Derrick Jones Jr is top 50 in the league?
Would've been nice if Stotts gave more minutes to Derrick Jones Jr instead of Rodney Hood
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
Derrick Jones Jr flies around on D
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
I GOT THAT SHIT. GET OUTTA HERE DERRICK JONES JR
i was deadass at my first NBA game and a pandemic came through and ended that   Devonte Graham and Derrick Jones Jr are dirty af tho. American Airlines arena is awesome too
"I think it's because stars dont go anymore. Before dunk contests were chock full of stars like MJ,  3pt contests had Craig hodges  Now the 3 point contest has steph, and dunk contest derrick jones jr"
Did they resign Meyers just to be an expiring contract able to clear cap room this summer? Because for 10 million dollars you could have retained Derrick Jones Jr.
"Both pat and thad are playing lauri's position right now. So he's not exactly needed when the dude that the new front office just drafted 4th overall has taken his spot. Also thad is our second best player lol.  Lauri also gets hurt every year, is inconsistent on offense, can't switch on the perimeter on defense, can't protect the rim either, and also doesn't box out well for rebounds. And just in general a 7ft power forward who can't switch and is a negative defender isn't going to be starting for a contending team so...  I used to like lauri but, we should definitely shop him. He shouldn't be in our long term plans. Especially not as a starter if we plan to be good anytime soon. Also I'll give it like a 1% chance anyone would give up a first round pick for lauri lmao. I don't think lauri's value is that much, even if it is a late first.   He's not worth the  20+ mil he wants. I'd rather have derrick jones jr or talen horton tucker for below 15 or 10 mil than lauri since they'll be much cheaper and can actually defend the perimeter. I doubt theres a lot of bulls fans that still view him as a core piece anymore."
**Airplane Mode**  (Derrick Jones Jr.)  Honorable mention to Isaiah “Beef Stew” Stewart.
being athletic isn’t all that matters ex derrick jones jr
"&gt;That doesn't matter. They don't need good vets to get better, they're trying to build organically. No good vets are coming anyway because it's Oklahoma City. Just like they don't come to Washington or Phoenix or Minnesota.  I mean they brought in CP3 and signed Jae Crowder who has been one of the biggest reasons for their dominance this year. Like no one wanted to sign with us last off-season because no one believed yet in the KAT/D'lo/Ant pairing. We whiffed on Derrick Jones Jr. and Paul Millsap btw.  So yeah until the Thunder proves they can win again they won't be considered a FA destination for vets."
the fact that Derrick Jones Jr isn’t out number one option on offense right now is proof why we need to hire Chauncey Billups instead of mega loser stotts
"Yeah, the person who watches every Timberwolves game is talking out of his ass with an unbiased opinion of Ant's bounce.  His vertical is very good. But ""elite"" is traditionally reserved for the top 5-10 dudes in the league. I don't think he's THAT good of a vertical leaper (it's hard to be when you're 230 at 6'4"").  When I think ""elite"" I think Derrick Jones Jr, Zach Lavine, Dennis Smith Jr., etc."
"Trade for Derrick Jones Jr, Cassius Stanley and Dennis Smith Jr. The team will still tank, but there's going to be lots of highlight dunks to keep the fans interested. Add Poku, Bol Bol and Tacko as well, and watch ticket sales sky rocket."
"i want so badly for dame to win a ring in portland but i dont think it can happen with terry stott's coaching strat of ""dame shoot ball"", any half competent team exposes our lack of any kind of defensive identity. not to mention the fact that the team still doesnt handle any kind of trap on dame with a semblance of a plan. if they can't do well with this roster in the post-season there has got to be some changes in coaching and front office personnel. injuries have been a plague through the year but this team has no excuse for being so poor on defense.  EDIT: why the hell is derrick jones jr. not playing more? i just can't wrap my head around it."
"I will take his 3% decrease in shooting traded for his increased assists and rebounding.  Duncan is having a great season.  Agree with you on Hero, but Kendrick Nunn is outplaying himself this year now so who knows.  Not saying DD is ""the key"" either but at least when bam goes out now, someone bigger comes in his place. Before he would leave and like,  Derrick Jones jr would come in."
"Lucking into Cade or Mobley would be 🔥. Outside of that I’m curious who we go after this summer. Rosas has a tendency to chase down old flings so maybe we’ll kick the tires on guys like Derrick Jones Jr, Nance, Millsap, maybe even Collins still? I’m sure other names will come up too."
"I pulled this up from Blazers edge: “Outside of dunk competitions, Jones’ physical tools yield serious results inside the restricted area. Last season, he connected on 74 percent of his 185 attempts at the rim. According to Cleaning the Glass, that placed Jones in the 94th percentile of at-the-rim finishers at his position.”  Article link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.blazersedge.com/platform/amp/2020/11/23/21590836/trail-blazers-derrick-jones-jr-free-agent-forward-analysis-offense-defense"
"Not true. Derrick Jones Jr was one of the best finishers in the NBA last season in Miami but in Portland the Stottsfense turned him into a spot up 3 point shooter (same thing happened with Mo Harkless earlier). Nassir Little is also an excellent finisher at the rim.   And to your point, Ant doesn’t need to finish through contact. Portland has outside threat which pulls defenses towards the perimeter. Since all eyes are on CJ and Dame, you can set plays initiating backdoor cuts with Simons on the baseline. Pick and pop with Nurk and Dame/CJ will pull the big further up. Have Nurk flip a pass to the cutter and viola, but Portland rarely runs that play at all."
But Derrick Jones Jr never played for the Wolves?
"Which is why maybe we shouldn't play those guys so many minutes and DNP our good defenders, as Stotts does. But hey, that's just me. Here's tonight, for example.  Derrick Jones Jr: 5 minutes  Rondae Hollis Jefferson: 5 minutes  Melo: 19 minutes  Simons: 13 minutes  Kanter: 14 minutes  That's the most even it gets too. Sometimes he plays Melo near 30 and doesn't play DJJ at all. Besides, it wouldn't matter who you gave this team. We'd suck with Gobert. Good defenders can't fix a broken scheme."
Airplane Mode - Derrick Jones Jr.
Derrick Jones Jr. and Kyle Anderson
"I would still take Derrick Jones Jr, but it's damn close. DJJ just jumps out of the building."
You're not exaggerating. I remember a game when he couldn't even back down Derrick Jones Jr.
Yeah and who is New Orleans biggest FA signing JJ Redick lol?????  What about Portland isnt it Derrick Jones Jr????
Porzingins for Roco and Derrick Jones Jr. could be win-win. Portland adds a star and Dallas gets some good wings
Derrick Jones Jr gonna be smiling somewhere if this happens
"Naw. I dont agree. We're a bad franchise so guys don't wanna sign here. Guys like Derrick Jones Jr pick Portland because they are a good franchise. We could have signed him this season for what he got. He talked about how he almost signed with us. But guess what? We got the stench of being a bad team. Of course we aren't signing lebron level guys no matter what. But the role players/better FA will come if we were a better franchise.  And again, the Twins and Vikings get good FA, more so the Vikings, regularly. The difference? They aren't poorly run organizations."
"There are still some guys who would be able to dunk with the rim that high. Bol Bol, Tacko, Lavine, Gordon, Derrick Jones Jr, Lebron etc"
I've already told you dude. Read the comments and ingest the information instead of just waiting for your chance to word vomit inaccurate negativity.  Kanter's minutes would've been replaced by Zach Collins. This is neither a Terry or Neil (roster construction) problem since he re-broke his ankle during preseason training camp. It was on Terry to play Kanter over Rondae Hollis Jefferson and Harry Giles at the 5.   Melo's minutes could've been replaced by Derrick Jones Jr and/or Nassir Little. DJJ was our max MLE free agent signing and Nassir Little was a promising 2nd year 1st round pick.  Dame sits for a whole 8-10 minutes a game. During that period we played Anfernee Simons at guard who's a deadly scorer (way more efficient than Carmelo fucking Anthony).  You're just speaking straight nonsense right now. Go away.
"Homie, the Suns suited up a total of 8 players for that game and the starting lineup consisted of Derrick Jones Jr, Alex Len, Marquese Chriss, and Tyler Ulis lol. I think Chriss was like 1/10 that game too. Nobody on the team could put the ball in the basket. Booker shot over 50% in that game. He was playing winning basketball, but the clowns around him couldn't do shit that game"
Athletic doesn't have a single definition. Derrick jones jr is pretty freaky.
"he did scheme a lot, he also coached multiple iterations of the Blazers that ran wildly different sets.   If you think Stotts is to blame for Derrick Jones Jr. not solving our lack of offense on the wing I don't know what to tell you. Taking the ball out of Dame's hands to give it to DJJ or Roco or Harkless or Aminu is not good coaching, full stop. Sure you can run a motion offense and do that but it will be worse"
"I love simmons....but its damian friccin lillard.  We'd have to give up all our young assets and multiple picks on top, not just simmons. It'd be maxey + thybulle + reed + joe (maxey and thybulle are the only two with real value there).  And we might have to still sweeten the deal with a trade of another player (maybe seth for derrick jones jr).  Without those young players and assets theres just no point for portland to do this trade otherwise.  Although to be fair, most trades i've seen seriously underrate lillard to my eye."
"Well, he thought adding Derrick Jones Jr and RoCo would solve the perimeter defense issue. Except DJJ isn't a starting quality player, so it didn't work out"
"this team had a coach who made kanter and melo (2 players that were either out of the league or were given away for free) major rotation players. 20+ minutes a night for each of em. That more than anything sank this team since they're so awful on defense and they had a coach who was committed to playing them, which created an accountability problem (if you were to watch nurk's post game session, this was obvious).  Keeping a core of Nurk/RoCo/Norman/Dame (and hopefully trading CJ + FRP's for a SF of some sort) is really nice. Zach Collins/Nassir Little/Derrick Jones Jr/Anfernee Simons are much better options to come off the bench than guys like Melo/Kanter, who just brick your entire team.  The org just needs to get this coaching hire correct, re-sign Norm and find a decent trade package for CJ (doesn't need to be a star, just need a better fit - like a Harrison Barnes type). And obviously move on from Kanter and Melo (who are FA's).   I just don't understand why it's so hard to picture fixing Portland."
Even derrick jones jr had some insane dunks
"I loved this video. Switching principals and having the whole team locked in on the same wavelength is so goddamn underrated. I know Portland has some poor defenders but we also have some players that are individually pretty good (Nurk/Zach Collins/RoCo/Derrick Jones Jr/Norman Powell). But my god, some of the switches we do (and non-switches) is just comical. No one knows what the other defender is thinking or expects, so it just either becomes never switch or switch every single time. Never any fucking nuance or strategy."
"I mean a team's struggles ultimately fall on all three of players, coaching, and management. It's the player's job to execute a scheme to win games, it's a coach's job to design and adjust a scheme so the players can execute, and it's management's responsibility to supply players who can execute as well as a coach who can get his players to execute.  In Stott's case - he had two clear objectives given by management: to win a playoff series and improve the defense. Management supplied the team with guys they thought Stotts needed to improve the defense, and therefore win a series, with players like Derrick Jones Jr and Robert Covington.  In Stott's case - the management did seemingly give him players that would improve the team.    Add Gary Trent Jr's comments this season about being asked to do way more within the Raptors' defense - and it's hard to say Stotts got too much blame. Maybe he wasn't actually given enough talent to work with - but management has every reason to believe he was and that he failed at his job."
"Derrick Jones Jr is terrible at basketball  Olshey has made more than some big mistakes  The 2016 off season, the 2017 draft, the off season after the WCF appearance are all franchise altering mistakes. All 3 would be grounds for firing  If Olshey had brought in an even semi-competent bench we beat the Nuggets"
"We agree that there needs to be a change at the top, but Stotts it not a good coach. He has been carried for nine years by Dame. I'll give you an example of both the coach and the front office completely failing at their jobs. Throwing our entire MLE at Derrick Jones Jr. The signing made no sense. Yes, he's supposed to be a good defender, but his offensive abilities are very limited. I think he can work in the right system, but every single blazer fan knew that Stotts wouldn't know how to use him. Terry's scheme for almost all wings is to stick them in the corner and wait for Dame or CJ to throw them the ball for a three. That's it. That's the extent of his ability to plan for wings. He hardly ever runs back cuts or lobs. Partially because Dame is awful at throwing lobs. So it's on the front office for signing a player that their coach wouldn't/couldn't get the most out of, and it's on the coach for being shit at maximizing a player's strengths. So rather than figure it out, Stotts just benched him. Our biggest free agent signing last summer sat the last 1/4 of the season and the entire playoffs."
"what about CJ McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr. &amp; Anfernee Simons to the Pelicans for Brandon Ingram &amp; Eric Bledsoe's terrible contract?  Maybe some draft compensation has to also go to the Pelicans in this scenario?"
"The starting lineup when he dropped 70 in Boston included Marquese Chriss, Alex Len, Derrick Jones Jr, and Tyler Ulis. They also only had 3 bench players available for that game as well.    This dude has been on some of the worst rosters ever. It was seriously a revolving door of g-league talent with coach firings every season.    I'm so happy he's getting the respect he deserves as a star in this league."
Wasn't Derrick Jones Jr a big part of the Blazers rotation in the regular season? What happened to him?
Does Derrick Jones Jr even get any playing time?
Derrick Jones Jr. He’s not an amazing defensive player but he’s long and super athletic. Just want to see if he could give MPJ some more resistance.
"Book won't sniff 70 again because he'll never be in that dire of a situation where he was the only person who could put the ball through the hoop in that fateful day in Boston where the Suns rolled out 8 total players and the starting lineup included Marquese Chriss, Derrick Jones Jr., Tyler Ulis, and Alex Len lol    Teammates are too good and Suns have multiple scoring options and competent players and coaches now"
"TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, Derrick Jones Jr., Alec Burks, Facundo Campazzo"
Derrick Jones Jr. has the length to defend MPJ. Maybe throw him out there and see what type of energy he brings to the table.
"I had a friend whose step sister went to duke with Kyrie and they went on a date together and the sister said he was super stuck up  Also I have a friend from LA who is trying to have a big social media presence so he knows a lot of people, one day I was in the same room as him and he got a phone call from this girl who also does social media. She was leaving a super expensive hotel in an elevator and said she just gave Derrick Jones Jr head. He was in CA for a kings game. It’s funny how little some of these guys think because that girl was rich as hell but also had just recently turned 18. She never told him how old she was lol he just assumed"
"the unfortunate part is that I am not sure what's out there for them that makes them better.  The only young pieces they have are Simons &amp; Zach Collins, neither of whom hold a lot of value.  In theory maybe you can package those guys with the Derrick Jones Jr. contract for another veteran wing player but it's really tough to find an available player that moves the needle for them.  I don't know what you are getting for CJ McCollum (you could think about someone like Khris Middleton but the Bucks probably aren't interested) that makes the team better and Nurkic is expiring and I don't know how much value he has either.  Powell is a free-agent, maybe the team brings him back or maybe they can S&amp;T him to his preferred destination for something good."
*derrick jones jr ducks*
"I think Covington is a great defender and a good 3 point shooter at this point... but if he can’t operate out of the dunker spot and makes fucking DUNKS... get him a blow and let’s see Derrick Jones Jr.   Or GET Anfernee in there, no one else was making anything OR stopping anyone. At least Simons will make shots...  Ugh bad loss"
What happened to Derrick jones jr?
"it's extremely close to the same team. Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter. He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically. I'm sorry the Heat's run to the finals was based on the elite play of Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk and Derrick Jones Jr.  I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them. The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that"
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"As someone who doesn't follow your team, why'd you let your wings walk? Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Jr. Hell, even Solomon Hill."
"Derrick Jones Jr on Blazers, Solomon Hill on Hawks, Jae Crowder on Suns"
"Simons, Kanter, Melo have been the 3 that have played most recently  RHJ has gotten some run during this series  Nas Little has shown some promise but doesn’t get much time  The rest are all varying levels of bad  Derrick Jones Jr, Harry Giles, CJ Elleby, TJ Leaf and Dames cousin Keljin Blevins"

LeBron had a historic scoring night -	LeBron punches a white board, breaks his hand. Cavs lose the Finals  Yeah, I’d say that was definitely a weird team to say the least"
"Not enough for it to be straight up  The could send RoCo, Derrick Jones Jr., and TJ Leaf for him lol"
"The Lakers are better this season, and Bam had nothing to do with that, he was injured most of the series. It was Jimmy having an all time series plus our shooters being hot at the right time. This team doesn't have good shooters, and wouldn't have as good defense. You're ignoring the Heat having Derrick Jones Jr, Jae Crowder, and Andre Iguodala, who were all great defenders. Thats where depth mattered in the playoffs. Jimmy and Bam cant play 48 minutes and in the minutes that one of them is sitting they'd have completely atrocious defense."
You talking Derrick Jones Jr? I guess but Milsap only played 12 mins too. Going small against Jokic i don’t think is the way to go. If it’s just when he’s off the court you might be able to get away with it but honestly I don’t think either is ideal.
we got covington but that's not enough  we also paid this guy called derrick jones jr excuse me while i go drink nail polish
What’s up with the DNPs for Derrick Jones Jr? Why did they go after him in the off-season if he can’t play a playoff game?
"Losing Jae Crowder and Derrick Jones Jr has been HUGE for our defense, and Jae was a sharpshooter last playoffs. Dragic aged and is very quickly approaching washed status, and Herro is slumping."
Derrick Jones Jr went from starting 43 games earlier in the season to being out of the rotation during the seeding run and now playoffs.
At least Bertrans had a decent Game One.  Luke Kennard and Derrick Jones Jr went from starting games earlier this year to being out of the rotation for the ending of the season and playoffs. Either of them are up for LIP.
"Derrick Jones Jr.  Got a 2yr/$18 million contract from the Blazers and went from starting 43 games earlier this season to now being completely out of the rotation in the playoffs.  Luke Kennard and Montrez Harrell also get consideration, but they weren’t expected to start."
"Yeah, everyone needs more 3+D guys with strength and length, and almost all the playoff teams can offer the deal he got (mid-level exception).  Maybe he doesn't get the years on the back end without the hot shooting, but I think he's better than Derrick Jones Jr. (who got 1+1 at the MLE), so honestly him getting 3 at the MLE isn't crazy to me at all."
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
Derrick Jones Jr has to play over Melo if he's not hot
"Reminds me of an unintentional pun a commentator made recently when Derrick Jones Jr. made 1 of 2 free throws after being struck in the testicles:  ""...and Jones Jr. Splits a pair"""
1. Melo posting up for 10-15 seconds and shooting a turnaround contested shot 2. Kanter guarding anyone but slow centers 3. Derrick Jones Jr standing in the corner
Jimmy regressed slightly.   Bam while he improved is still as passive and cowardly as ever offensively.  Robinson is better.  Dragic is worse.  Herro is worse.  Nunn is better.  Iguodala is so bad now saying that he's worse is an understatement.  Jae Crowder wasn't the only loss. We also got rid of Kelly who was pretty inconsistent but he could catch fire randomly and kept Lopez out of the paint. Dipo played like 4 games too. Derrick Jones Jr was a role player but he sparked the offense when he played.  Bucks definitely got better but don't blame the Giannis injury on them losing last year.
The entire media and this sub Reddit were going nuts this summer about how great they did in the summer I was so confused. I guess everyone thought Derrick Jones jr was good? Idk.
"Derrick Jones Jr., Solomon Hill, Meyers Leonard, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk. These were tough role players they are missing now. Oladipo’s addition would have been big this year"
My favorite bit of the box score is how Derrick Jones Jr. was +8 in five minutes in the first half and hasn't seen the floor since despite the rest of the bench being absolute trash
I would really like to see more Derrick Jones Jr. on the floor
Looks like they just swapped Crowder for Ariza. Who else did they lose on their wings? Derrick Jones Jr. and Soloman Hill didn't get much minutes (at least in the NBA Finals).
&gt; unless they have that superhuman bounce and length  i need to see kyle anderson isolating against derrick jones jr. for 48 minutes
Take out Nurkic and add Derrick Jones Jr. and I think the blazers would do it
"I think a Jae Crowder / Derrick Jones Jr type would’ve been better  A wing with some size  Trez had some great games in the regular season, but paying someone close to $10m that isn’t going to see playoff minutes seems like a bad use of it to me"
"We were starting Derrick Jones Jr and RoCo at wings, both lengthy and tall defenders most of the year, but still had bad defense. Problem is Nurkic was out most of the year again. Everytime over the years  when he’s healthy and anchors our Defense the rating goes up significantly (like how it has for past many games), he’s the key it seems."
Yes I also saw Derrick Jones Jr which is nonsense
Derrick Jones Jr the Giannis stopper 🤦‍♂️
Derrick Jones Jr. barely played in the bubble playoffs.
Heat aren’t winning. they lost Derrick Jones jr and jae crowder
Yeah you're right. It's like comparing Bron to Derrick Jones Jr. Not even close.
"Hamidou Diablo (spelling), Terrance Furgeson, Derrick Jones Jr. Don't have good footwork. It's not automatic at all. Kemp didn't have footwork like other great big men. Neither did Kenneth Faried.   Defending Harden when he is jealous and plays no defense tells us all how you feel and how much you can analyze the game."
"Offense:   Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Norman Powell, Carmelo Anthony, Jusuf Nurkic  Defense:   Norman Powell, Derrick Jones Jr, Robert Covington, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Jusuf Nurkic."
He’s probably not a starting SF on an actual contender but he’s better than anything we’ve had since. I’d much rather be paying him 10 million dollars per year than paying Derrick Jones Jr 9 million dollars per year
"You have Norman Powell and CJ McCollum in case you are well defended, speaking of defense you have Zach Collins Robert Covington AND Derrick Jones Jr defending. And a great Center in Nurkic and an excellent rebounder in Enes the Big Penis Kanter."
"willingness is one thing, but it doesn't exactly feel like they can even get ""deep"" into luxury tax in the upcoming season, exactly?  like, they're over the cap with 9 players (assuming norm and derrick jones jr opt in), $127M.  then they, i guess, re-sign zach collins and, i dunno, enes kanter for whatever they're worth, use the MLE and maybe the bi-annual and then vet mins for the rest, that still doesn't seem like a lot.  the cap hold for zach is $16M for spotrac, does that seem right?  kanter is like $6M, everyone else is small.  like maybe next year they could demonstrate that they're willing to spend on whoever is deserving, but not sure how much they've upgraded the roster by then or how dame will feel a year later, depending how they've done.  (unless they manage some S&amp;T with their FAs that gets them someone useful, i guess, but base year compensation still means that contract isn't too huge because it's not counted by the outgoing FAs new contract.)"
"Eh RoCo was not the problem with this team, he is one of the only good defenders on the squad (along with Nurkic and maaaaybe Derrick Jones Jr.). The problem is Neil Olshey stocked the roster with iso offensive players that can’t defend — Dame, CJ, Melo, Kanter, Simons. Like my god the bench rotation was a defensive sieve."
"There were numerous years where the defense was around 16th, which was part of the goal. Have an elite offense and an average to above average defense.   All Stotts ever needed with Dame was a defensive center and some 3 and D wings. He never really got that outside of Nurkic. He got Anthony Tolliver, Mario Hezonja, Enes Kanter Derrick Jones Jr who shoots 25% from 3 and Melo. Robert Covington was the only one and he's a bit overrated on defense.   Stotts failure was Olsheys to begin with."
Which was 95% on Olsheys ridiculous roster construction  Him forcing Anfernee Simons into a PG role  His contingency plan for Enes Kanter becoming unplayable was Rondae Hollis Jefferson  Him paying 9 million dollars per year to Derrick Jones Jr who is barely an NBA player  Every issue the Blazers have had over the last 6 years has been at its root because of Neil Olsheys incompetence
"For sure, we did the same thing with Derrick Jones Jr. who is essentially in that same mold. Interestingly enough, Jones Jr. is listed as a 6’4” SF so an even more undersized wing. I think he leverages more athleticism, but to your point, he closed out tons of games last year when we wanted an athletic, defensive mindset. Butler, him, Crowder and Bam. Can’t remember which other guard we would use, but I guess defensively it would have been Iggy.   Gosh, I already miss that team. It was sneaky versatile when you think that Dragic, Herro, Robinson and Kelly O. brought completely different skill sets than the guys listed previously. This year’s Heat team was a shadow of it, sadly."
"""Let me tell you a little story about the 2020 season. I was doing this deal with Houston for Robert Covington, never once touched the salary cap. I'd go to the trade machine, get some Enes Kanter, Derrick Jones Jr, Cup-A-Rodney Hood... baby, I got a stew going."""
"I think if Zion was about 30 lbs lighter, he'd be as athletic as young LeBron.   The crazy part about Zion is how athletic he is *for his bulk*. There are guys that can jump with him (some even better), but they're usually rail thin like a Derrick Jones Jr. Zion flies like a little guy but it's built like a fucking semi truck."
Don't forget as a judge he screwed Aaron Gordon out of a slam dunk contest win to pump up Heat player Derrick Jones Jr.
Sure but all I’m asking for is some competent role players and not paying the full MLE for Derrick Jones Jr
Derrick Jones Jr looks like he has moon boots on
I can’t believe I haven’t seen anyone say Derrick Jones Jr
derrick Jones jr has a similar one I think
Vince Carter and Derrick Jones Jr. Dunks look effortless and graceful but also with power.
we'll give you three Derrick Jones Jr.'s and a bridge of your choosing
I mean he went 21/40 from the floor and made 24/26 free throws I think that's pretty efficient. When Marquese Chriss is 1/10 shooting and the other guys on the court are Tyler Ulis and Derrick Jones Jr. you are gonna have to shoulder a pretty big scoring load
"Heat alone had tyler herro, kendrick nunn, derrick jones jr, and duncan robinson all make the finals in their first post season"
"Nah Harkless was an important part of a consistent playoff team. Derrick Jones Jr can’t get minutes over Rondae Hollis Jefferson  I irrationally love Moe Harkless though so I’m probably not being objective  Olshey 100000% sucks though, I think he’s the worst GM in the league and has been saved by having Damian Lillard"
Derrick Jones Jr.
Derrick jones jr
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
"Idk what exactly Toronto gets, but this is a 4 team trade idea I have to get 3 players in different situations.   Pascal Siakam -&gt; PHI, Ben Simmons -&gt; GSW, Draymond Green -&gt; POR  Why the Sixers do this: Siakam is a much cleaner fit next to Embiid offensively due to his superior shooting abilities, whilst at the same time, not blocking the development of guards like Tyrese Maxey and Shake Milton. Siakam takes over Simmons role as primary perimeter defender. More than anything, this trade makes Embiid *happy* as Siakam is one of his guys since they are both from Cameroon.   Why Golden State does this: This is a bet on Ben Simmons reviving his career in the most optimal situation for him. You are essentially hoping to turn Ben Simmons into the next Draymond Green with some slight differences, Simmons is not the rim protector that Draymond is, which makes Wiseman important, conversely Simmons is a much better perimeter defender and a point of attack defender is needed with Klay likely not being up to scratch in that kind of role anymore.   This is a talent acquisition bet for Golden State, their 5 they would be rolling with would be Simmons/Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Wiseman.   Why the Blazers do this: This is pretty simple, to make Dame happy. Dame and CJ have long wanted to play with Draymond after that 2019 WCF series where they were exposed to just how good he was, CJ went as far as photoshopping him in a Blazers jersey.   I'm not too sure what Toronto ends up with in this scenario, Covington for sure as part of salary matching and I suppose one of Nurkic or Derrick Jones Jr.?   Not sure who would need picks out of this to be properly compensated."
Cheap wings? Good luck. That's how you end up with Derrick Jones jr lol.  I'm still high on Nesmith.
I don't know why everyone assumes that the team would willingly trade Dame when it's more logical that all the other players would get traded instead. It's most likely that they re-sign Norm to be the starting SG and then trade CJ  for a wing that can be an upgrade on Derrick Jones Jr.
"[https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/1362980387245334534](https://twitter.com/NateDuncanNBA/status/1362980387245334534)  That was his tweet, look at the time and manner he posted it.   Furthermore in the replies, even other NBA media people were giving him a hard time about it.  Its perfectly legit to criticize a players performance, but to do it right after everyone is appreciating an amazing dunk.  That's like watching derrick jones jr or Miles bridges pull of an insane dunk in the game only to choose that moment to point out their underwhelming season  or game stats."
There will be a guy coming to you soon telling you how their entire defense issues would have been solved by  playing Rondae-Hollis Jefferson and Derrick Jones Jr. who gets bounced more than Kendall
"all it takes is 1 team.  I mean, consider that guys like Mason Plumlee make &gt;$8M/year, or Derrick Jones Jr. who makes $10M/year.  Cam Payne has to get significantly more than that.  It's risky, I think there's a solid range of outcomes where whoever signs him regrets the deal, but he's an ascendant player entering his prime years and he's getting buckets efficiently on the biggest of stages.  He's getting a bag this summer."
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
"Here is my three team trade idea.  Portland gets: Simmons and Myles Turner  PHI gets: CJ and Covington  Indiana gets: 1st rnd pick from Portland, 1st rnd pick from PHI, Derrick Jones Jr., Henry Giles III, George Hill (expiring deal that makes the money work).  I think that's pretty fair for everyone involved. Portland (assuming Powell stays) and PHI possibly improve (if the chemistry goes well for either) to more contender level, Indiana treads water and stockpiles picks and solid young rotation players i return for their 4th best player."
"CJ, Derrick Jones Jr, and a 1st for Ben Simmons and Seth Curry, who says no?"
"He’s not a bum, but they need to go get a guy that can cover up his weaknesses. They need a tallish dude that can rebound and make it out to the three point line. He doesn’t have to shoot or be a great rim protector, he just needs to do those two things.  Maybe they go after a guy like Derrick Jones Jr.? I know he’s limited but he’d be better against those small lineups."
"&gt;First off I did not say he is a feel good story.   This entire thread is about players who ""redeemed"" themselves, a group in which Carmelo is being erroneously included.   &gt;Your original point is that melo is the biggest problem with the team. This is complete wrong.  You're bending over backwards to find ways to argue that the worst player to get minutes, who does terribly in those minutes night in and night out, isn't the biggest reason the team loses.  Any no-name player who wasn't a 10x all-star or however many it was shows up and gives the low-effort, lazy, inefficient performances Carmelo does and they'd be universally reviled on this sub. But since guys grew up watching him and he used to be good the excuses never end for him.   &gt;You haven’t even mentioned any other points of mine of how the other players did horrible as well.  The only player to be nearly as bad as Carmelo in the playoffs was Kanter, but unlike Carmelo Kanter was actually productive in the regular seeason and a large part of the reason we were still in the playoff hunt with CJ and Nurkic out for half the year.  &gt;You cant use him as a scape goat for all the other issues.  The team having other things it needs to improve doesn't change the fact that he's the worst player to get minutes on the team and fucks up both our offense and our defense whenever he's on the court.   The #1 change the team needs to make going into next year is improving the bench (yes, even more than trading CJ or whatever other stuff people yell about). We had the worst second unit of any team in the playoffs (well, Western playoffs at least).   The #1 way to improve the bench is by replacing Carmelo with any other marginally productive forward who actually gives a modicum of effort on defense and doesn't jack up terrible shots whenever they get the ball.   Ergo, he's the biggest problem with the team and needs to go. If he's on the team next year taking double digit FGA again, we're a first-round bounce again (if we even make the playoffs), full stop.  &gt;Coaching problems with his mins  Yes, the problem with his minutes is that he has any.  No coach or system could make 2021 Carmelo productive. He's terrible.  &gt; roster construction,  ""Roster construction"" is not a singular problem. If you're going to bring up abstract concepts instead of something tangible, there's no point.  &gt;and CJ being a role player not a star.   Nonsensical complaint. You might as well say ""the biggest problem with the team is that Dame isn't the best player of all time"" or ""the biggest problem with the team is that Derrick Jones Jr. isn't Kawhi Leonard."" CJ is who he is -- a good player who contributes to the team winning basketball games more often than not, despite an underwhelming (not even ""horrible"" like you keep saying) playoff series this year. Sure, it'd be nice if he was a better player, but he isn't the main problem with the team. The guy playing losing basketball every time he touches the court is."
If we do that can we also have Seth back? We can offer you a slightly used Derrick Jones Jr
I've seen Porzingis fail to post up Derrick Jones Jr. successfully. I don't see Rudy succeeding against similar players.
"I don't know, man. Harry Giles days are numbered. Meyers Leonard would be out of the league soon even if he weren't a racist. Derrick Jones Jr isn't getting any max deals. Jonathon Simmons had like a three year run. There are plenty of tall, very athletic dudes that aren't nearly as good or accomplished as much."
"That's why casuals adore Derrick Jones Jr....not. It all shifted to the three point shot. If you can't shoot it, casuals see no place in the league for you."
"PG - Ben Simmons  SG - Andre Roberson   SF - Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  PF - Jonathan Isaac  C - Bam Adebayo  Bench - Kris Dunn, Matisse Thybulle, Derrick Jones Jr, Michael Kidd-Gilchrest,  Nerlens Noel.   I'm not sure how this team would ever score, but I think they could win one defensive slugfest against a bad team where they just hold them to like 80 and get a bunch of transition buckets"
"Derrick Jones Jr, Anfernee Simons, Greg Brown. Wow."
"Derrick Jones Jr, Anfernee Simons and now Greg Brown. We've got some DUNKERS on this squad. Sure would be nice to utilize them correctly."
Yes I would in fact trade Cody Zeller and Derrick Jones Jr. for these two
"Contenders that have $9+ million in bad salaries:  **Clippers**  Luke Kennard - $12,727,273	  **Nuggets**  Will Barton - $15,625,000	  **Nets**  DeAndre Jordan - $9,881,598  **Lakers**  Talen Horton Tucker - $9,500,000	  **Celtics**  Josh Richardson - $11,615,328	 Al Horford - $27,000,000	  **Blazers**  Derrick Jones Jr - $9,720,900	  **Hawks**  Gallinari - $20,475,000	  Bogdan Bogdanovic - $18,000,000	  **Pacers**  Myles Turner - $18,000,000	  TJ Warren - $12,940,000	  Jeremy Lamb - $12,940,000	  **Suns**  Jae Crowder - $9,720,900  **Bulls**  Lauri Markkanen - $9,026,952"
It's mostly the Reddit hive mind and a majority of this sub is too young to have watched prime DWade so they parrot the nonsense they read here.  Wade also pissed off a bunch of casuals when Derrick Jones Jr. won the dunk contest over Aaron Gordon.
Someone on the Blazers who's going absorb Dame's touches. Derrick Jones Jr. maybe?
We'll give you one slightly used Derrick Jones Jr...
Derrick Jones Jr.
"In terms of in-game dunkers, I'm always fond of guys who aren't afraid to push the boundaries, put on a show, and hurt the rim. There's a lot of athletic freaks out there who just don't seem motivated to do anything special (tough to fault from a game perspective) but among the dudes I think are doing it right at the moment:   [Ja Morant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeBRMSwc8VY&amp;ab_channel=MemphisGrizzlies): He could be a super athletic basic dunker if he wanted but his willingness to do things like [add a two-hand windmill to a mid-game lob toss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrSq-z8TRyk&amp;ab_channel=HouseofHighlights) is what makes him a special dunker to me.   [Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clPeyxb8SVs&amp;ab_channel=NBA): Would make Kenyon Martin Sr. proud, and probably a bit jealous.   [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-GUJ0hJ4&amp;ab_channel=NBArtv): Some of the best tomahawks in the league.   [Derrick Jones Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E72NkHc-gSU&amp;ab_channel=SPProductions): Lost track of him this year and I didn't watch the full highlight clip but based on what I saw from him in Miami, I imagine he's still mostly worthy (I know there was an injury or two in there that may have had an effect).   [John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_H3hnqd9_E&amp;ab_channel=RookieProductions): Might be my favorite big man dunker at the moment."
Derrick Jones Jr
Terry Stotts was/is a very good coach who got the most out of most of the shitty rosters he had to work with  Derrick Jones Jr is very bad at basketball and him being taken out of the rotation was the correct decision
Derrick Jones Jr is a matching salary btw
Would you be interested in one Derrick Jones Jr?  We are low on our all offense no defense power forwards now that Melo left.
&gt;Kelly Oubre the classic subtraction by addition every where he's gone really is the move to sell Dame on.  Have you met Derrick Jones Jr
Derrick Jones Jr
"He’s one of those guys who Spoelstra made look better than he was. A la Josh Richardson, Derrick Jones Jr"
"Unironically it would be an improvement.  We haven't had a starter-quality SF since... Batum.  After him it was Harkless, a few games of Rodney Hood before he got hurt, making Bazemore play the 3, old ass Ariza for a few games, I think we started Melo at the 3 in the bubble, Derrick Jones Jr., then Powell.  Powell is a good player, but he isn't a small forward.  Just an all-round clusterfuck."
"I’d remove the dunk contest. It feels like we’ve seen it all, and star players rarely participate.   The most memorable recent dunk contest was when Dwyane Wade “messed up” his score as a judge, leading to a controversial Derrick Jones Jr win over Aaron Gordon."
"Wait no, Gobert could not reach a higher point than say Gerald Green or Jaylen Green, Derrick Jones Jr, etc"
"Derrick Jones Jr and a 2nd. Alley oops for days with Zo, Lavine, and DJ"
"Greg Brown, Derrick Jones Jr and Nassir Little might be the most entertaining dunking trio in the NBA."
"Cj McCollum, Derrick Jones Jr + 2 future picks"
Portland would have to add draft picks and maybe someone like Derrick Jones Jr. when Lillard has missed games CJ has averages 28.1 ppg 5 rebounds and 6.2 assists. With someone like Embiid I’m the middle it could increase those stats.
junior swap:  POR receives Larry Nance Jr.  CLE receives Derrick Jones Jr.  jones is a little cheaper right now and will be off the books after this upcoming year to clear some space for cleveland. jones also is still pretty young at age 24 and may fit better with cleveland's timeline.
"Fuck that keep that 30m dollar waste of space, afraid to shoot, never improves his game, would rather play cod, bum away from this team. His regular seasons are completely irrelevant when he is essentially Derrick Jones Jr in the playoffs. He has shown absolutely no drive to improve and all the worries people had of him pre draft have come to fruition. He will never shoot a respectable jump shot. He is a complete offensive liability. You don’t pay someone 30m for that. Horrible horrible horrible trade"
Where's Lillard-Derrick Jones Jr.
I've heard talks of swapping him for Derrick Jones Jr - what a mediocre trade that would marginally benefit both parties
What would people think of Jrich for Derrick Jones Jr?
LeBron did what to Derrick Jones Jr?!
Derrick Jones Jr highlight reel will have the next generation thinking he was Vince
"I’d propose a three way trade with the Pelicans to bring in Brandon Ingram for Randle and a pick, send Lonzo and a couple picks to Portland, and Derrick Rose to NO. Then I’d try to sign a guy like Hassan Whiteside or Derrick Jones Jr in free agency."
"Look at the flair. We gonna throw everything at y'all, including that 2027 pick because y'all have what we want...  &amp;#x200B;  Derrick Jones Jr, you stingy bitches"
"So their closing lineup is going to be something like: Lonzo, Lavine, DeRozan, Derrick Jones Jr, and Vucevic? They'd better score a ton, because they're not stopping anyone like that."
"I think you're maybe taking Rotation Player the wrong way. Rotation Players are like solid guys that you want on your roster. And I'm just guessing that anything Prospect is probably constrained by years in the league. They probably aren't categorizing anyone going into their 4th year as a Prospect.  Don't want to put words in your mouth. I think rotational player is probably right for him. His ceiling is definitely higher than that, but I'm guessing this is looking at his most likely scenario.   Norm Powell is also a Rotational Player. Gordon Hayward is a Rotation Player. Aaron Gordon. But so are guys like Frank Ntilikina and Derrick Jones Jr. It's a big range."
"We lost a lot. People talk about us gaining Lowry and that’s great, but he is much older than he was even when he won a championship.   Beyond that, from our 2020 Finals run, we lost, Dragic, Crowder, Olynyk, Iguodala, Derrick Jones Jr., Nunn and Meyers Leonard.   We’ve added old Lowry, old PJ Tucker, Markief Morris and Dewayne Dedmon.   Really and truly, I don’t expect too much production out of Morris and Dedmon and even with them we lost 7 rotation guys and added 4. The ones we added are older and our bench is shorter. We went from being 11 deep to about 7 deep unless Okpala and Gabe Vincent to actually earn more minutes which they really haven’t as of yet.   It’s hard to win a championship without solid bench production and nobody on our bench really pops, scares a team, or does really anything so well as to be incredibly positive for us."
For the life of me I cannot understand why Derrick Jones Jr. is ranked ahead of some of those guys.
"Jusuf Nurkic is a solid interior scorer, despite the fact that he shoots EVERYTHING off-balance. It’s so weird.  Derrick Jones Jr. can only score by dunking."
"I feel like Miami is probably even better than Toronto-- Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn were both undrafted players. Bam Adebayo, way better than draft outlook. Herro better than draft outlook. Team frequently finds G league diamonds in the rough. A lot of your teams rotational players were at some point Heat development projects (Tyler Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr, Josh Richardson, etc etc.)"
"Lonzo 26 Zach Lavine 26 Demar Derozan 32 Patrick Williams 20 Nikola Vucivec 30  Bench  Alex Caruso 27 Coby white 21 Troy Brown Jr 22 Derrick Jones Jr 24  Tony Bradley 23  Ayo, marko simmonovic, devon dotson, javonte green"
"Lonzo,Derrick Jones Jr and the Blazers 1st rounder"
"Salary-wise, plenty.  * Boston: Al Horford  * Denver: Aaron Gordon + Monte Morris  * Portland: Covington + Derrick Jones Jr.  * LAC: Bledsoe + Kennard  * etc etc.  A lot of competitive teams have 1-2 bigger contracts they'd be fine parting with.   It's just those trades + picks aren't enough to compete with what Minnesota/Sacramento/Cleveland can offer up."
"We had the #2 ORTG in NBA history with Derrick Jones Jr in that spot , and that was without CJ or Powell.   You can make it work when you have a guy like Dame that draws 2 from 30 feet"
"For sure, I think the Clippers suffer from a few issues. First and foremost was Kawhi’s injury. If he stays healthy there, we could’ve possibly been talking about a Clippers championship right now.  I like the Mavs a lot, huge Doncic and also Cuban fan, but I think they need to replace Porzingis. Dude is too injury prone and Luka needs another solid star next to him. If they can do that, they’re a top team in the league. Luka is so young and so talented, there’s so much time there, especially now with him signing a max extension.  I think a second round exit for the Bulls would be huge. For one, it gives Lavine 2 playoff series’ of experience he otherwise wouldn’t have. Second, it probably makes him resign. They can address the needs in the off-season and make another run.  Side note: I think them adding Derrick Jones Jr as another defender off the bench just increased the deadliness of this team. They’ve now got a great mix of young athletic guys and solid veterans."
"I had to look up who TBrad is, apparently is Tony Bradley, some random C. DJJ is Derrick Jones Jr.   Why he would abbreviate on a non-bulls sub for average role players is beyond me though"
He wouldn’t be top 10 but Derrick Jones Jr would be an all time great
It’d end up where derrick Jones jr will win mvp
"Hey, its cool. Lauri is a solid backup big to pair with mobley and allen, on a potential overpay. But ya I was pumped to see Derrick Jones Jr, a 1st and a 2nd. Like woah. Though the Lauri market was dead."
"i'm just saying, in comparison to Lauri Markannen or Derrick Jones Jr, Nance is playing at an entirely different level right now. For Portland to somehow swing that out of nothing is big, especially with Dame one foot out the door. I could see Nance being a Jae Crowder type for them, which is maybe the glue they need.  And btw, I don't like the Blazers at all. Lillard and Portland can go fuck themselves after 2014 lmao"
Wow. Bulls are big winners. Derrick Jones Jr is a pretty dank player who is ready to take another step forward at 24.  Lavine and DJJ dunk szn
Derrick Jones Jr. and Anfernee Simons. Duh.
And Derrick Jones Jr. He was good in Miami with Jimmy.
Lmao whatever ya say bruh. I've watched every Bulls game since 2014. They lack athleticism and length off the bench.  And AND DERRICK JONES JR ISNT GONNA PLAY MUCH. Who the fuck cares what he has or the Bulls have.   He has different athleticism and wingspan than what they already have. Hes a 3rd string energy guy.  Fuck outta here.
"Bulls: Derrick Jones Jr., 2022 lottery-protected 1st round pick from Blazers, 2023 2nd round pick from Cavs(via Denver).  Blazers: Larry Nance Jr.  So basically, the Bulls won overall but Blazers are winners too for getting an upgrade for a pick that they'd probably not utilize since they aren't on rebuild or sth. I don't what are the Cavs smoking though."
Bulls got Derrick Jones Jr and blazers get Larry
The absolute disrespect to Derrick jones jr in this thread is astonishing
"Derrick Jones Jr, Gerald Green, Vince Carter"
"Gerald green, Derrick Jones jr and zach Lavigne for hops"
"The Giannis one was a great prediction. I loved watching Giannis when he first came into the league but I wasn't sure if he could actually contribute to top tier contention, to me it was more like ""man what crazy shit is he going to do tonight"" he's been a human highlight reel since Day 1. I was afraid he was just going to more of just a flashy athletic marvel like Derrick Jones Jr or Shannon Brown or something, instead of the freight train he's become today."
It’s wild how a bench warming squad has three of the best dunkers in the NBA right now. Wish the Blazers kept Derrick Jones Jr just to add one more insane dunker off the bench
"Almost nobody on the Chicago roster currently is a 2 way player, *including* the guys AKME has added. DeRozan, Vuc, Troy Brown Jr, Derrick Jones Jr, Bradley, Green, Johnson, plus LaVine, Williams and Coby are all predominantly one way players. Lonzo is a good 2 way guy, Caruso to an extent, but that's about it.  *Maybe* the FO wants to build that way long term, but right now I'd argue that high volume bench scoring is more valuable than yet another defender on that second unit."
"Derrick Jones Jr always stood out to me, he can really get up  It's probably Zion by a mile if you consider his weight though"
"&gt;Which player is the most athletic?   1. Zion Williamson, New Orleans – 27%   2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee – 20%   3. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota – 17%   4. Zach LaVine, Chicago – 13%   5. Ja Morant, Memphis – 10%   &gt; Also receiving votes: Hamidou Diallo, Detroit; LeBron James, L.A. Lakers; Derrick Jones Jr., Chicago; Ben Simmons, Philadelphia  https://www.nba.com/news/2021-22-gmsurvey  The Most Athletic poll is in the Misc section towards the bottom of the page."
Pure athleticism skills not included it's probably derrick Jones jr
"If we're talking pure hops, I'm going with Derrick Jones Jr. He's incredible"
Last year in a game against Portland he couldn't even post up Derrick Jones Jr.
No Derrick Jones Jr? Guess you don't have culture in your veins
Bet he’s gonna sneak Derrick Jones Jr onto the list.
"Obviously Caruso is amazing. Coby will be great when he's back as a spark plug scorer.  Beyond that it's shallow, but I'm pretty hyped about hte potential of: Green/Johnson/Derrick Jones Jr. as defensive rotation guys.  Javonte Green especially was playing out of his mind in the preseason.  I don't think all three will be particularly good, but I think one of them is going to pop and give us something consistently.   Ayo is fun but super raw so I think he'll have moments where he helps but won't look forward to any stretch where we rely on him. I think we'll do a fair bit of staggering DeMar and LaVine even though they can start/close together so we can paper over some lack of scoring."
"2011 playoffs, I substitute Luka for Nowitzki:  Kyle Lowry (Kidd)  Derrick Jones Jr. (DeShawn Stevenson)  Luka  Luguentz Dort (Shawn Marion)  Brook Lopez (Tyson Chandler)  Bench:  Jordan Clarkson (Jason Terry)  Brunson (Barea)  Carmelo Anthony (Peja)  Willie Cauley-Stein (Brendan Haywood)  Minimum contract veterans for the spots of Cardinal, Mahinmi and Brewer."
"Raja Bell was at most a decent role player for a team. This would be like saying the 2021 Bulls are a good team because of Derrick Jones Jr. They were good, but it's not because of them"
"I agree Charlotte is gonna be hella fun this year, however bridges is not the best dunker in the league lmao. I can name two guys on the Bulls who are both better (lavine and Derrick Jones Jr)."
"Lakers Records vs Teams who made the play-in and above with notable opponent players who were injured, DNP, or have yet to be acquired.   Without AD but with Lebron:  1. 109-98 L vs BKL (missing KD) 2. 96-94 L vs MIA (missing Dragic, Oladipo) 3. 127-124 L vs WAS 4. 114-89 L vs UTA 5. 102-93 W vs POR(missing McCollum, Nurkic) 6. 117-91 W vs GSW 7. 114-104 L vs PHX  8. 105-100 W vs IND 9. 128-97 W vs GSW 10. 116-105 W vs CHA  With AD but without Lebron:  1. 108-93 L vs DAL (missing Prozingis, Boban) 2. 116-107 L vs WAS 3. 93-89 W vs DEN (missing Murray, Milsap, Gordon) 4. 118-94 L vs LAC 5. 106-101 L vs POR (missing Derrick Jones Jr.) 6. 123-110 W vs PHX 7. 101-99 W vs NYK  Noteworthy: Andre Drummond was already acquired by April 24, when AD returned from injury.   Results:  Lebron 5-5. From here, 3 of Lebron’s losses came against #1 and #2 seeds. Also from the games played, the point differential was +31 in favor of the Lakers. This means that their losses were closer games than their wins, which were mostly blowouts.   AD 3-4. The Lakers may boast some better Ws in this collumn, but remember that this was with the addition of Andre Drummond, a key Centre that can take load from AD as they play the same position. The Lakers were also -33 in point differntial. This means that they barely squeaked out the 3 Ws but were blown out in the other 4, which is true.   In this small sample size, it’s clear that in a long term scenario, the Lakers with Lebron’s performance is undoubtedly way more fit to perform consistently throughout the season, winning games they’re supposed to win and staying close in games where they’re the underdogs. For the Lakers performance with AD, they may get some scrappy wins, but it’s not a reliable way to win throughout 70+ games.   The Lakers with Lebron &gt;&gt; The Lakers with AD"
This is like when Wade voted for Derrick Jones Jr in the slam dunk contest
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
Derrick Jones Jr
Derrick Jones Jr walks around on 2 Tigger (with a T) tails
Derrick Jones Jr.
Missing slam dunk champion Derrick Jones Jr too
"Lavine, DeRozan, Derrick Jones Jr., Caruso, Javonte Green, and Lonzo for lobs.  This team feels like it was BUILT to generate highlight dunks, and there's substance to the style too, since the Bulls proved last year that they can create a good defense out of bad-to-mediocre personnel."
"So am I wrong to say that this Bulls team is a highlight dunk factory?  Think about it: Lavine, DeRozan, Derrick Jones Jr., Caruso, Javonte Green, and Lonzo for lobs. This team is gonna lead the league in posters-per-minute."
"I love that your reasoning is Celtics &gt; Bulls because of scoring and efficiency, but LaVine is the best scorer and by far the most efficient player on either roster.   You say the Bulls will have a bad defense because they lost Thad Young. But the fact is that Chicago had the 7th best defense after the Vucevic trade, Donovan is a terrific defensive coach, and they replaced Thad with strong defensive players in Caruso, Lonzo, Stanley Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr., and Tony Bradley."
Derrick Jones Jr
"Caruso, coby white, Derrick Jones jr are all solid?"
"Like it would turn the most average players into lower level all stars.   Bobby Portis with Jokic court vision and ball handling? Monster  Derrick Jones Jr. with Luka’s court vision and Ball handling? Monster   Grayson Allen with Trae’s court vision and Ball handling? Monster   Etc, etc…"
Aaron Gordon made less aesthetically pleasing dunks than Derrick Jones Jr so dj Jr won
"Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozan, and Derrick Jones Jr are all on the same team. Doesnt quite fit your criteria, but it's a pretty good mix of players that have won/participated in the dunk contest."
"If you commit to it and leverage the advantages in other areas it can be a viable strategy. Chicago is doing something similar, playing 3 and 4 guard rotations and playing big minutes with guys like 6'4 Javonte Green and 6'5 Derrick Jones Jr at C. Even though true bigs can bully them inside it's difficult to crash the boards against them because you have 5 guys on the floor who can punish you in transition.  Obviously every strategy has counters so it's unlikely that it'll be a go-to strategy long-term, but when you're only playing each team 2-3 times a year there's less game planning than in a 7 game series, so you can get away with it for a time."
Would love to see the Bulls trade Pat Williams + Derrick Jones Jr for him but I’m not sure how either side feels about that deal  Lonzo-Lavine-Demar-Grant-Vucevic is scary to think about
AD getting clowned by KAT isn't the embarrassing thing. That can happen on any given night. The embarrassment is the Bulls game at Staples. Vucevic out for Chicago and you had Derrick Jones Jr putting in more effort on the boards than AD. Pathetic.
"One thing that I think people tend to overlook is that being able to effectively use your athleticism is very much a skill. Body control when driving, body control in the air, changing pace etc. are very much skillful things in my eyes. We’ve seen guys that are absolute genetic freaks that can’t really showcase it more than a few times a game if they’re lucky. I’m talking guys like Shannon Brown, Jamario Moon, Gerald Green, Derrick Jones Jr. that are all-world athletes but could never really use that athleticism to be a consistent force on the court."
"Yes lmao, i don't get what people want from coaches i swear, like sometimes people think that coaches will go on the floor  The perfect example of defense is Pop, look at the Spurs now after being a top defensive team for literally 20 years, they are ass, why is that? Well yes because the roster is bad defensively  You had some Blazers fanboys here that i had to tag saying that it was Stotts fault because he didn't play Derrick Jones Jr. more minutes otherwise their defense would be better lmao"
Javonte green Tony Bradley Ayo dosunmu Derrick jones jr Coby white   Checkmate
"I dunno, I'd watch Pop check in Elon Musk specifically to get posterized by Derrick Jones Jr."
"Tyler Ulis is a 5’8 guard who couldn’t shoot and never got picked up after being cut by the Suns. Dragan Bender, 5 years later, isn’t a top 3 player on his Israeli team. Marquesse Chriss would be a g-league candidate if he wasn’t already 23 years old.   I understand that, but what you’re completely missing is that the Phoenix Suns that year did not have a legitimate 8 NBA players either, shown by the fact that the only non-Booker player still playing in the league is Derrick Jones Jr, who was a 19 year old 2-way at the time. Literally over half of that Suns team was out of the league by the end of the next year. Meanwhile, that Kentucky team has had more players with staying power in the league than anyone other than Booker.   FRANK KAMINSKY WOULD UNIRONICALLY BE BY FAR THE 2ND BEST PLAYER ON THAT SUNS TEAM"
"I said that active team without Booker, and I honestly question your basketball knowledge if you don’t think it’s possible. That team was rookie Tyler Ulis, Rookie Marquesse Chriss, rookie Dragan bender, Alex Len, rookie 2-way Derrick Jones Jr, 34 year old last season Barbosa, Jared Dudley, and 2-way Alan Williams.   There are less legit NBA players on that team than 3-4 college teams the last few years, including the Kentucky team DBook was on just two years before. The second best player outside of Booker might’ve unironically been Jared Dudley. Half of them didn’t deserve an NBA spot, and have since clearly proven that.   College teams wouldn’t beat an NBA team, but that wasn’t an NBA team outside of Booker."
"We've been playing 6'5 Derrick Jones Jr and 6'3 javonte green at center and it's been working for the most part. They've been better than Tony Bradley on everyone who's not a bruiser, and then we have vooch when he comes back for that"
Derrick Jones Jr can fly
"Derrick jones jr always gets higher than you’d expect, he has crazy hops"
He has one where he gets under a player either on the trailblazers or suns pretty sure its the blazers and they end up hurt i think it was derrick jones jr maybe but he basically undercut him in the air and they ended up taking a tumble that one wasnt cool
"Agreed. They need a big that can play D outside the paint, but can still push guys around on the glass. Derrick Jones Jr being 120 lbs and defending the 4 is a problem."
"I’d trust Lonzo on most bigger wings than Williams,  Williams is more of a great defender in theory at this point and less of an actual great defender.  Javonte Green and Derrick Jones Jr are also better defenders right now"
Derrick Jones Jr and Troy Brown Jr gets you about 2 million short. They could add in another player on a minimum contract I suppose. That might be giving up too much for him though

"Derrick Jones Jr., from behind the dotted line, off of two feet, dunking with two hands, localized entirely within the Ball Arena?"
"Aaron Gordon letting Zach know he hasn’t forgotten about the dunk contest. Huge win to end the road trip, big ups to Derrick Jones Jr. for always being ready to contribute despite up &amp; down minutes early on so far this year. I know the Bulls’ bench isn’t elite or anything, but after the past few years just having some guys who are reliable &amp; have a/some strong skill sets is an enormous upgrade in general for our depth"
And our starting PF. We have so little depth we play 195 lb Derrick Jones Jr at  center.
And Derrick Jones Jr
Derrick Jones JR. as well. We've got dunkers for days.
Shit and also dunk champ Derrick Jones Jr.
"Derrick Jones Jr, Pat Williams, Coby White, and Tony Brown Jr for pascal? Lol"
Derrick Jones Jr has been a better backup center than Tony Bradley
I'm really puzzled as to why AD sits in the corner spotting for a three. When a 6'5 210 lbs Derrick Jones Jr. was guarding him...
DeBallZach popped off but also a great game from Derrick Jones Jr. aka the Slim Leaper
"lakers are so small with bron and ariza out, on the back line when a big goes out on a pnr, it’s a bunch of 6’3/6’4 guys, you really noticed it on those derrick jones jr rolls to the rim where 6’6 djj is just towering over rondo or bazemore who are helping   tht looks good"
"Refs actually helped him out, he was getting out played by 6'6"" Derrick Jones jr"
"Derrick Jones Jr is the most underrated signing for this team, especially with Vuc out"
I can’t see the Clips losing to a team with no rim protection and their only wing defender with a prayer of guarding PG in Derrick Jones Jr makes it easier for the Clips to double LaVine and DeRozan because of his lack of a 3 pointer   And before you bring up it’s a B2B for the Clippers they practically played a scrimmage and didn’t over exert themselves
Derrick Jones Jr has to be up there.
He looks really smooth out there which betrays how hard some of those things he does really are...  ...that being said Zach might not even be the most athletic guy on his own team with Derrick Jones Jr on the squad as well.   The NBA is so ridiculously athletic.
"If you believe this then you clearly don’t watch basketball. By your logic, Derrick Jones Jr. would be the GOAT if he simply “worked harder”. Wiggins has always had a questionable handle that has kept him from being a main option. Nothing to do with work ethic."
Yes. Go watch some lebron or MJ highlights or hell even derrick jones jr
Derrick Jones Jr.
Anyone got a tutorial? It's starting to annoy me that so many great moments aren't getting clipped that Derrick Jones Jr dunk was insane and I'm a Sixers fan that's how crazy it was.
"Facts. Tyler Johnson, James Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Whiteside, Mcgruder, Derrick Jones Jr.  We got all those dudes a nice pay above the league minimum because they actually deserved it"
I think Derrick Jones Jr and Troy Brown Jr are pretty expendable as far as the Bulls go. Neither one is all that special.
Those RFA rights turned into Larry Nance Jr. which turned into a first round pick+Derrick Jones Jr
"Bulls: 6-1. With solid wins against Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. Our only loss was a one point loss to the Knicks. And we even had the ball at the end to try to win that game.  I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."
"My boy Derrick Jones Jr with the game-high of +23 on the court, whew"
Lmao Derrick Jones Jr gets the +23
Wait they have Derrick jones jr too? Holy shit Chicago might be my new 2k team
shout out derrick jones jr for some amazing defense on tatum and brown in the 4th
"Based on the Utah game, those somebodies are Tony Bradley and Derrick Jones Jr.  Coby White still hasn’t played a game yet either."
Our next best Power Forward is either Derrick Jones Jr. or Javonte Green. How do you think they could handle defending Julius Randle?
Lillard/Trent/Derrick Jones Jr./RoCo/Kanter  That was Dames lineup for 20 games last season because both nurkic and CJ were out at the same time. His second best player in that lineup was Trent....who averaged less a game on worse TS% than Wiggins   We still had the #2 ORTG of all time during that stretch.
"Also Derrick Jones Jr and Kelly Olynyk who both played roles in that run. That’s besides the injuries, COVID, and a huge regression from Dragic."
