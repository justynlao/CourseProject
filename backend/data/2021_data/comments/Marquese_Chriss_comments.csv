"Warriors centers:  James Wiseman - Out with sprained wrist, at least 1 week  Kevon Looney - Out with sprained ankle, too soon to know how long  Marquese Chriss - Out with broken leg, rest of season  Alen Smailagiƒá - [Out with meniscus tear,](https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/alen-smailagic-surgery-20210104) possibly back soon  Eric Paschall - Is 6'6""  Draymond Green - Is 6'6"""
"1) Ralph Sampson exists lol. They clearly drafted Hakeem for talent   2) After reviewing the 2018 Suns roster, idk why Luka would be a bad fit. I mean the only other ball dominant player with a future they had was Booker. I can def imagine Luka and Booker playing alongside each other. Plus, they could‚Äôve swung a trade for Capela or actually let Marquese Chriss develop at center.  3) I cannot imagine why a team would pass over an exceptional talent to meet some arbitrary team fit requirement. If the Suns GM could predict the future, he‚Äôd definitely take Luka. Especially for a rebuilding team, you need to acquire as much talent as possible. Once you‚Äôve refined your roster, then you can start worrying about fit"
Reporter klay made a special appearance during the third quarter. We had injured marquese chriss on the other day too
Warriors recently had Marquese Chriss on their broadcast on Monday against T Wolves. It‚Äôs a cool gesture so that fans get insight on their current status and candid firsthand on the team‚Äôs practices. But they should limit it to just a quarter not the entire game lol.
"Yet Poeltl was drafted before Domas who went 11th behind Dragon Bender, Marquese Chriss , Jakob  Poeltl and Thon Maker among others. The Bucks could have teamed Domas with Giannis but instead took Maker."
all this time I thought marquee matchup meant a game that included Marquese Chriss
"But to be fair we have revitalized Javale McGee, Zaza Pachulia (I know I know sooOoO dirty), Nick Young, Marquese Chriss, and now Wiggins."
"We had dragan bender, tyler ulis and marquese chriss starting for us at one time. A few changes here and there you'll be back. KATs too good."
[Only when Marquese Chriss and Jared Dudly went after him after Chriss airballed a dunk](https://streamable.com/ffvlfx)
"Help us Marquese Chriss, you're our only hope"
"If healthy, Marquese Chriss instead of Wiseman, but keeping Wiseman in there is good for the long run."
"Who else on that team was going to shoot the ball? The only other 2 guys you would even consider shooting were Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, who were both injured.   So Tyler Ulis? Derrick Jones? Jared Dudley? Marquese Chriss went 1-10. I'm quite comfortable in saying no one else in that squad could score the ball"
"Not sure about food fights, but the only time I've been to Cleveland I saw Serge Ibaka fight Marquese Chriss.   Fun times overall"
I remember him hooking Marquese Chriss and KCP in back to back games last year.
"They nailed Paschall, picked up Damion Lee who is a nice player, revitalized Marquese Chriss who recently broke his leg. Not to mention it's not exactly easy to find talent out of nowhere."
"Agree 100%, many players that bounce around like Christian Wood in the league usually has the apparently ""attitude"" problems but most of them do not actually self improve even though they have the athletic gift. A good example off the top of my head is Marquese Chriss. Early in his career he thought he was the man because he was a lottery pick and his attitude problems often showed on the court. He's been on 6 teams now in 7 years and it look like he hasn't improved at all."

"I sold my land on Justise Winslow Court last year. My current investment portfolio of Fultz, Marquese Chriss, and Dennis Smith Jr. is a mixed bag right now."
"Marquese Chriss used to be a 21 y.o. Top 10 pick too.  This hasn‚Äôt nothing to do with his age. The skill set he got drafted with is not particularly valuable, and he‚Äôs going to have to significantly add to it to become useful to a good team at a contract number that he would find suitable.   There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúthis guy needs to get better and more consistent at things he already does well‚Äù  &amp; ‚ÄúThis guy needs to acquire new skills that he‚Äôs nver shown.‚Äù  Bagley is the 2nd sentence. Not impossible (olidipo &amp; Ingram did it.), but really freakin hard."
This is the game where I decided Marquese Chriss is nothing but an absolute piece of shit...we already knew that about Dudley before this happened.
I miss Marquese Chriss
"It would really depend on the individual. From what we've been hearing from Kerr/Steph/Warriors FO/etc., it seems like they're giving him as much patience as required (at least publicly). The fact that he's only expected to be a solid role player for the next two years, plus Klay's return* next year, means that he doesn't really have too much weight on his shoulders at the moment.  *Marquese Chriss is also expected to return next year and, although he's no where near the player that Klay is, having him back in the big man rotation takes even more pressure off of James to be an instant contributor."
"Jarrett Allen has this same mindset and I loved him for it. Had some amazing blocks (Lebron James, Blake Griffin, Giannis) and has been postered plenty of times (John Collins, Marquese Chriss)."
"Are you forgetting that Draymond went on live television during the bubble run and openly tampered with Devin Booker, saying ""Get my man OUTTA Phoenix?""  Or forgetting the times Draymond slandered the Suns organization to defend Marquese Chriss playing major minutes for a team that went 15-50?  Or how about the time Steve Kerr let the players coach in a blowout vs. the Suns?    And if you're talking success after a long drought and being cocky af, how about the 2015 Warriors winning a championship due to injuries to 2 of the 3 best players on the cavs and immediately talking shit?"
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"It's been 10 years since the playoffs and 8 since a decent team. And I've watched most of those shitty games putting hope in Dragan Bender, Tyler Ullis, Marquese Chriss, etc. It feels oh so good that the bubble wasn't a fluke"
"Yup. Totally the defense. The supporting cast of Isaiah Canaan, Mike James, Ryan Anderson, Jimmer Fredette, Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson, Brandon Knight, and Elie Okobo all did what they could. Earl Watson and Igor Kokoskov coached their tails off... but Book's defense was just too bad üòî"
Lol I‚Äôd love to see Luka on a team where Earl Watson is coaching and his running mates are Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss lmao
"No. The picks used helped to swallow the remaining salary of the Brendan Knight and Marquese Chriss contracts, as well as ship out Nick Stauskas in the deal that brought Shumpert's expiring contract to the team.  The Rockets could have used the same picks package (technically less) to get JaMychal Green and Garrett Temple from the Grizzlies, but were averse to the $3M in tax that deal would have incurred."
"I'm starting to think that any player drafted for athleticism is an almost sure early warning sign for a bust. DSJ, Marquese Chriss, Josh Jackson, Mudiay, MKG, even going back to Tyrus Thomas or Stromile Swift. It's the the basketball equivalent of brawn and no brain."
"idk how people expected Booker to carry the likes of Tyler Ulis, Isaiah Canaan, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Mike James, and the corpse of Jamal Crawford and Tyson Chandler, and a bunch of even more forgettable names to the playoffs. All of whom received extensive minutes"
"Wym he was playing with bonafide NBA superstars like Marquese Chriss, Alex Len and Jared Dudley. How much more help did Booker need"
"Suns starting lineup that game was Tyler Ulis, Book, Derrick Jones Jr (who I like a lot but he was very raw back then), Marquese Chriss (who I don't like a lot but was also incredibly raw) and Alex Len. 3 guys off the bench who got minutes were the corpses of Leandro Barbosa and Jared Dudley + Big Sauce (Alan Williams, my guy!)"
"&gt;Ben's contact is the reason Powell fell like he did  Yes, I'm not denying that, it should indeed be a foul. I wouldn't even be too mad if it was called a flagrant on Ben.    My point is that ""hard fall =&gt; uneccesary contact =&gt; flagrant foul"" isn't necessarily true, and isn't how flagrant fouls are defined or called.    &gt;any hard contact that fucks how a guy is landing should be considered reckless   this is what the comment I replied to asserted. This is simply not true, even aside from this particular play in question - there's tons of examples of blocks throwing dunkers off balance and messing with their landing, none of which would be considered flagrant:  - [Shannon Brown on Mario West, called a foul, but clearly not flagrant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCosVKXcmTE)  - [Kenneth Faried on Dion Waiters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNNtJsiZU4)  - [Blake Griffin on Deron Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t98hZOkoUIY)  - [Marquese Chriss on John Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YUOWbGwQA)  - [Gordon Hayward twice on the same play against the Celtics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHuflreCWs4)   Forget Simmons / Powell, these are all examples of hard blocks messing with a guys landing. Tell me which of these are flagrant?"
"just admit you don't watch the Suns. You want Booker to drag the starting lineup of Tyler Ulis, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender, and the corpse of Tyson Chandler to the playoffs lol"
"We somehow convinced ourselves that Josh Jackson, Marquese Chriss, and Dragan Bender are the future. Remember when Earl Watson said he wanted to run Bender at the point and we all got hyped for some reason..."
Marquese Chriss Paul George Karl Malone
You put no effort into it. Even something like ‚ÄúMarquese Chriss Paul George Hill‚Äù is better (but still sucks)
this aint no marquee matchup without marquese chriss
I thought Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss were going to put us in the playoffs by 2018.   I thought Josh Jackson‚Äôs floor was Andre Iguodala.   I thought Devin Booker was just going to be a spot up shooter.   All my Phoenix Suns tales have been awful.
"yeah those two guys were realllll bitches for that shit. one of the larger contributors of the disdain i have for marquese chriss. i didn‚Äôt know you guys didn‚Äôt like each other though, lol. the suns and the jazz are my favorite west teams"
"From my view a few years ago during Mitchell's rookie year some dude on Twitter asked if people would take Book or Mitchell. This was back when Book was very much seen as an empty stats guy so Suns fans already had a bit of irritation regarding the perception of Booker, plus seeing people pick a rookie (who I believe hadn't even played yet) very much irritated us. Things kinda picked up from there, you know how that shit goes, I don't think it helped on the Jazz side that Marquese Chriss had that cheapshot bullshit on Rubio a few years back also. I don't really mind the Jazz at all (Mitchell won my heart when he told that one fan ""you did this!""), but it's easy to see why the animosity is there and in both directions it can get testy for no real reason lol"
"I mean, yeah, I've said that repeatedly Wiggins is shittier Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't have said that Barnes was some essential part of the Warriors plans going forward in 2015.   What I've said is that Wiggins is there to serve as a dual purpose of being able to play Harrison Barnes role on the court, but the real purpose of him is salary filler in a trade for a star. The Warriors hoped that they'd be able to improve his trade value, and honestly, they've succeeded so far in that aspect given the way everybody talks about him.   &gt; You can't run the death lineup for 34 minutes a game. This is the reason why. Kerr has said this himself.  I know that, but honestly what's wrong with Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss as your centers? I'd rather have Melo and play those guys as my 5s/upgrade the 5 position via free agency than draft Wiseman was my point. You can always find centers. Hell, our starting center for the last 1.5 years has been a guy we found abroad playing in Germany and he's been awesome for us."
"Who says they needed to trade Wiggins? Start Kevon Looney or Marquese Chriss at center. Draymond is STILL their best center anyways, he just can only play there for 10 mins/game.   You have:  Steph/Melo/Wiggins/Dray/Looney w/ a bench of Wanamaker/Lee/Bazemore/Paschall/Chriss  Then when Klay comes back, you have:  Steph/Melo/Klay/Dray/Looney w/ Wanamaker/Lee/Wiggins/Paschall/Chriss   OR you bring Melo off the bench:  Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Looney w/ Melo/Lee/Bazemore/Paschall/Chriss   And ultimately, because Draymond is still best at the 5, they would close with:  Steph/Melo/Klay/Wiggins/Dray"
Shams keeps doing this.  - He tried to break the date of when Curry would be returning from his hand injury last season. He was wrong. The Warriors hadn't even decided at that point.  - He prematurely ruled Marquese Chriss out for the season with a broken leg. Warriors refuted that and said that he would be re-evaluated in March.  This is the kind of thing that I think the old-school guys like Mark Stein take exception with when it comes to Shams.
"Makes me so damn happy.  As a UW grad there's been so much hope for so many guys coming into the NBA, but either they don't pan out, or some bullshit happens like B-Roy's knees, or Isaiah having that insane season with the Celtics and then his body failing him too.  Nate Rob, Terrence Ross, Quincy Pondexter, Tony Wroten, Spencer Hawes, Marquese Chriss.  A lot of 1st round/top 10 picks that had decent careers, but just didn't really seem to work out.  Fultz injury this year fucking sucked, have been looking forward so much to his continued improvement. And I was worried about Dejounte the first year or so.  Now with Dejounte balling the fuck out and Matisse locking people down in Philly, it's looking pretty good finally. Hope Fultz can bounce back again too."
"They got 15 wins with Juan Toscano Anderson, Jordan Poole, Marquese Chriss, Mychal Mulder, and Omari Spellman..."
"&gt; They didn‚Äôt have Dray for the first 1/4 of the season and he was mediocre for the next half. Only in the last 5-7 games has he been approaching his normal play.  Still better than whatever G-league player took his minutes.   &gt;And he still can‚Äôt score.  He has never been a scorer. Not sure what your point is   &gt;Wiseman has been a massive net negative and has been injured for several games.   Better than Marquese Chriss, Omari Spellman, and WCS...  &gt;Looney hasn‚Äôt put in a ton of minutes, now he‚Äôs been out too.   Looney played 20 TOTAL games last season. He has already played 21 games this season...  &gt;Oubre has been a huge negative in the majority of games, playing well below replacement level  -0.3 is not well below replacement level.  &gt;Only Wiggins has regularly played and played well. And they had Wiggins last year (or DLo)  Wiggins played 12 games last season. D-lo was constantly injured and a terrible fit.  Overall...Draymond, Wiggins, Oubre, Looney, Wiseman, Paschall &gt;&gt;&gt; last year‚Äôs collection of G-league bums"
"I think it is mostly luck and basically a crapshoot. For example the Suns drafted Booker at the 13th pick but he was mocked around there and the Suns would have likely picked Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson instead if they fell. Similarly the draft class they got Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss was seen as an amazing draft class but ended up sucking. Kelly Olynyk was drafted by the Celtics who are seen as a great drafting team and I remember during the GM/front office survey he was seen as the biggest steal of the draft and not Giannis who was drafted two picks after him.  Also, another talking point people talk about is ""well, he was drafted by the right team and developed him is the reason he busted."" This may be the case were one team brings up the best of a player more than another to a certain extant but I think this is severely overrated as well for true busts. If this was case we would see a lot more busts who sucked on one team all of a sudden blossom on another that unlocks their potential. For example Josh Jackson was still only 22 years old when the Suns gave up on him and still was extremely young. If he had the super high potential that was hidden away and not developed because of the Suns he would have turned into the next Kawhi lite or w/e when he switched teams. The last time I can think of this sort of happening when one player is seen like a bust and then blossoms on other team is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't entirely fit the scenario."
"Yeah having Book, Ayton, Mikal, and Cam as a young core is light years better than anything we've seen during the decade of suck prior to this year. This isn't Marquese Chriss, Bender, Josh Jackson, etc. anymore. We have real guys to build around after CP3 is gone."
"And just to be clear on those teammates, he had:  - Tyler Ulis (2nd round rookie, now out of the NBA)  - Derrick Jones Jr. (undrafted rookie who had started 4 games to that point)  - Alex Len  - Marquese Chriss (rookie)  - Leandro Barbosa (last game of his career)  - Jared Dudley   - Alan Williams (undrafted second year player, now out of the NBA)"
"So long Marquese Chriss, spurs legend."
Spurs legend Marquese Chriss
"Spurs legend, Marquese Chriss"
Spurs legend Marquese Chriss
Why are Warriors fans so into Marquese Chriss? When did he become not terrible?
"This supporting cast is way better than that year's outside of Iguodala. Shaun Livingston, Bogut were totally washed, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook and Jordan Bell were not NBA level players. Marquese Chriss is better than whatever Boogie was that year. We'd basically be starting Oubre and Wiggins over McKinnie/Bell/Jerebko  Guys like Mannion, Wiseman, Poole probably wouldn't play much in a finals game when the rotations shorten. Steph would likely play closer to 40+ minutes instead of his usual 36. Raptors still win in 7 though"
"Without even lifting a finger this off-season we get: (potentially) a top 5 pick from Minny, (potentially) our own top 20 pick, Jessup (rookie who's been pretty solid in the NBL), (potentially) a healthy Marquese Chriss, a rusty Klay, and a 2nd year Wiseman.   On top of that, Warriors can likely resign Oubre, and draft some vets of Batum's caliber, who we mainly missed out on this past year because of Klay's injury. The point is, the FO has the potential to make tons of minor and semi-major moves during the off-season, so you can't treat this current roster as a finished product going into next season."
lol... i had to reread it to make sure he said Marquese Chriss..
He had a great first quarter. Then the Lakers relentlessly attacked him on switches for the rest of the game. It's games like this where I really miss Marquese Chriss
Suns could have drafted   * Jamal Murray  * Domantas Sabonis  * Donavan Mitchell  * Luka Doncic  Instead of :  * Dragan Bender  * Marquese Chriss  * Josh Jackson  * DeAndre Ayton  to pair with Booker since. This game can be played with pretty much every team in the lottery.
He‚Äôs the white Marquese Chriss
"He's basically an almost straight out of high school rookie, who hasn't had a normal offseason/preseason of practice (or any, since he got COVID). If he came into the league and immediately contributed to winning games, I'd be surprised.  That said, he has good night and bad nights, as well as good matchups and bad matchups.  Kerr was going to start him in the 2nd half of the season, but I guess b/c of that responsibility he wanted to send a message to him by benching him. I like the anger/ferocity he came out to play when he finally got in. I think it lit a fire under him.   He's having a rough year for a rookie in his situation. Marquese Chriss breaking his leg and being out for the season doesn't help, since it's just him and Looney as actual 5s."
"I bet on the Warriors winning. Eric Paschall, Kevon Looney and Marquese Chriss are at least real NBA players."
Marquese Chriss Paul George Hill
"Dragan Bender, Josh Jackson, and Marquese Chriss all lived up to their potential ehh?!"
"Tanking isn't a guarantee of turning the franchise around, the Magic know that from drafting Mario Hezonja 5th overall and Mo Bamba 6th overall. As a fan I'm content being mediocre then overpaying for a star FA when the team's cap and FA opportunity line up (like Charlotte did with Hayward).  Ask Sacramento (just for example) if it's a good idea for a small market to completely depend on the draft. For every top 10 pick that turns into De'Aaron Fox there's many more who turn into Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Caulie-Stein, etc."
"Wiseman missed half of this season, Marquese Chriss missed this whole season, Looney has missed half the season, Paschall missed 30 games.   I‚Äôm not saying the Celtics have been healthy, but you clearly only pay attention to them if you think they‚Äôve been the most injured team every year of the last 4 years."
"It's basically just all on Wiseman and hoping Klay comes back 80%+. Assuming the Minny pick is outside of the top 3, getting a good young contributor from that would be great too.  Aside from that there's not much that the org can really do to improve the team further. Hopefully we can re-sign Oubre, in which case the rotation would look like:  Steph / Poole  Klay / Bazemore / Lee  Wiggins / Oubre  Draymond / Toscano  Looney / Wiseman  That starting lineup is probably the best in the NBA, and the bench will be pretty good too, assuming Wiseman can improve to the level of positive contributor and Poole keeps improving too.  Mulder won't be on the team next season, nor will Smailagic. As much of a fan of Paschall I am, he's far better in an iso based system where he can just go to work in a face up on the low block, so I'd much rather trade him to a team where he can excel in return for Nerlens Noel or something(just as an example. someone of that caliber).  Also, Bazemore is good in general but I don't want him in the rotation unless he stops fouling so often. If we can get a respectable backup SG I'd be ecstatic. That would be a genuinely successful offseason to me lmao. If we can re-sign Marquese Chriss along with that I'd love Bob Myers forever."
Marquese chriss Paul George Karl malone
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
"It really is absurd.  Starting with the 2016 class, wroten, thybulle, Isaiah Stewart, jaden mcdaniels, jalen nowell, Markell fultz, marquese chriss..."
"I want to like you guys so much because I love watching Jokic. But you‚Äôre making it tough my guy. In November we thought our top 7 players would be Steph, Klay, Draymond, Wiggins, Marquese Chriss, Paschall, and our 2nd overall pick. 2 of the 7 played 2 or less games. Paschall and Wiseman have been off and on injured all season. That‚Äôs 4 of our expected top 7 either seriously injured or oft injured. Discrediting the losses because you didn‚Äôt have Murray is Asinine. Plus he played the entire game up until he got injured and we still beat you. We match up good against you guys because of our length on the wings. I don‚Äôt know what else to say other than enjoy Jokic getting MVP, he deserves it."
"Goran Dragic requesting a trade. Eric Bledsoe not wanting to be here. Kieff fighting Hornacek on the bench. Drafting Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, and Josh Jackson. Getting robbed by Trevor Ariza for $15 million. Watching Tyson Chandler rot away. Seeing Alex Len drop another pass. Yoga and layup lines with Earl Watson. Bringing 38 year old Jamal Crawford off the bench. Starting point guards Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Elfrid Payton, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Canaan, and rookies Elie Okobo and De'Anthony Melton.    And here we are."
"Like I said in the end, that‚Äôs nowhere near what the Warriors are doing with Wiseman. Capela was the 25th pick in the draft who had a 29-year old Dwight Howard averaging a double double as a solidified starting center ahead of him and the Rockets had other players like Montejunas who could at least fill in the center spot.   The Warriors started the season with 4 centers but went completely bankrupt in the center spot when Smailagic tore his meniscus and Marquese Chriss broke his leg in practice. The Warriors were already significantly capped out and Klay‚Äôs injury pretty much derailed any hope of possible contention so they really had no choice but to play Wiseman some significant minutes. The Warriors couldn‚Äôt afford to send Wiseman to the G-League because their center spot was so thin and they‚Äôre really only playing Green at center at times right now because that‚Äôs their only option."
It was this same system that made literally saved the careers of Javale McGee and Marquese Chriss. I don't think it was unreasonable to expect the #2 pick to not be the worst player in the league.
"Gentle reminder that the Warriors are missing: Klay Thompson, Marquese Chriss, James Wiseman, Eric Paschall, Kent Bazemore and Damion Lee."
"I think Draymond‚Äôs opinion of the suns was probably influenced by Marquese Chriss and Bender when they were in GS. The problem with the Suns these last couple of years has been their player development and poor draft choices. He just wasn‚Äôt expecting CP3 to get there, and saw no future for the Suns developing players"

"Can‚Äôt be an r/nba thread without at least one dumb comment. Didn‚Äôt know that we were expecting 20 year olds to drag lineups made up of Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyson Chandler‚Äôs corpse, washed Jamal Crawford, and Mike James to the playoffs. Crazy what happens when you finally put a team of NBA players around him."
Meyers Leonard? I don't think there are any Jewish people in Brooklyn.  Marquese Chriss could conceivable just run to the rim every time down. Lance Thomas is alive and was on Brooklyn's roster last year. Trash heap guys like Amir Johnson or Greg Monroe or Tyson Chandler.
If it is one of the hardest actions to guard then why don't they run it often? If you look at the stats   This season:  Curry has around 1.2 screen assists and generates 2.6 points... Juan is at 1.3 and 3.1  Marquese Chriss is at 1.5 and 3.5  Draymond couple of spots ahead with 2.9 and 7   In 18 - 19? .9 screen assists and 2.2 points   In 17 - 18? .7 screen assists and 1.7 points   So while he does set more screen compared to other guards it most definitely is not the hardest actions to guard by any means. His screens are way easier to fight over and it drains more energy out of him by doing that compared to other plays.  &gt; Also Curry could absolutely be a ball dominant pick and roll pg if the warriors insisted on playing that style. They broke the rockets in game 6 of 2019 eith one pnr action over and over.   This was when he was running it with Draymond who is one of the best decision makers in the league and the rockets were horrible in containing that but that's more so due to the fact that it was two of the best players running the PnR.
"Facts. I see great potential in Marquese Chriss if they can sign him in free agency but if trading, get someone like Bol Bol, maybe Wendell Carter Jr but a two way player would help a long way most definitely"
"Yeah and it only took him five years and a WCF berth to prove that maybe his talent was worth evaluating in a vacuum and not holding Ulis/Jordan Mickey/Canaan/Mike Jones/Dragan Bender/Jordan McCrae/Jimmer Fredette/Marquese Chriss/Jamal Crawford/Alan Williams/Alec Peters/Josh Jackson/Elie Okobo/Sonny Weems/Davon Reed/Jarel Eddie/Eric Moreland and dozens more of other's limitations against him.  Props for coming around, I guess."
"Homie, the Suns suited up a total of 8 players for that game and the starting lineup consisted of Derrick Jones Jr, Alex Len, Marquese Chriss, and Tyler Ulis lol. I think Chriss was like 1/10 that game too. Nobody on the team could put the ball in the basket. Booker shot over 50% in that game. He was playing winning basketball, but the clowns around him couldn't do shit that game"
"Yeah how dare Booker not win championships with Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson as three of his starters  What a bum"
"So if a player can't win championships with Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson as three of his starters he sucks?  I guess MJ isn't great either because he never won with a team that terrible"
Now that the Suns are good I can laugh about trading Bogdan for the rights to waste top 10 picks on Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss
"I disagree about the Ayton thing. You gotta know a lot of plays, how they break down, and also understand player tendencies in order to play the kind of post defense he does.    Our defense is pitiful when he's off the floor. And if he had poor basketball IQ, he would have never developed basketball-wise, much like Marquese Chriss."
"I mean there is a lot of superstars that have huge egos. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily that Steph talks to him, probably more so the way he talks to him. Steph is just genuinely like one of the nicest person around.  I think it was also Marquese Chriss that said something similar of he never expected Steph to treat him the same way as everybody else on the team. And he referenced playing with Houston/Harden not being the same."
"The starting lineup when he dropped 70 in Boston included Marquese Chriss, Alex Len, Derrick Jones Jr, and Tyler Ulis. They also only had 3 bench players available for that game as well.    This dude has been on some of the worst rosters ever. It was seriously a revolving door of g-league talent with coach firings every season.    I'm so happy he's getting the respect he deserves as a star in this league."
"nah he's supposed to carry a starting lineup with Tyler Ulis, Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender, and the corpse of Tyson Chandler to the playoffs"
"Book won't sniff 70 again because he'll never be in that dire of a situation where he was the only person who could put the ball through the hoop in that fateful day in Boston where the Suns rolled out 8 total players and the starting lineup included Marquese Chriss, Derrick Jones Jr., Tyler Ulis, and Alex Len lol    Teammates are too good and Suns have multiple scoring options and competent players and coaches now"
"Explain how a team starting tyler ulis, marquese chriss, dragan bender, and tj warren was supposed to make the playoffs LOL"
Marquese Chriss?
"If Marquese Chriss didn't go down, James Wiseman could have gone to the G league to get his reps and this team would have had another 5+ wins. Trying to develop that kid in the NBA was painful to watch. Our net rating was 11.4(!) points higher when he did not play this year."
"We‚Äôve had a string of unlucky injuries. Right from the get go Klay got a season ending injury, and a pretty serious one too. Then not that long after Marquese Chriss breaks his leg in practice and is out the whole season. So we only have 2 centres. Then Wiseman gets injured for the rest of the season and now we‚Äôre basically a small ball team with Looney as our only center. Oubre also had a season-ending injury basically since the Warriors aren‚Äôt in playoffs. Just an overall shit year with guys getting injured and not being able to consistently play together. Not to mention that we have a bench that lacks some depth. I know that‚Äôs no excuse for not getting into the playoffs but having a healthy squad for a whole season and being able to play together factors in a lot."
"If they hold onto him and he doesn't look any better next season, his trade value will Josh Jackson and Marquese Chriss level"
"Marquese Chriss was on the last year of his contract, traded to the Spurs and waived. He's injured so not a factor this year.   There is speculation that the Warriors still like him, and would be interested in signing him in July. I think it was stated he's still rehabbing in SF."
"We traded Marquese Chriss this season so our natural center depth is only Looney and Wiseman. So, unless there's a Center they are looking at Looney looks like a lock for another contract from the Warriors"
"If it makes you feel any better, the Suns drafted Dragan Bender (4), Marquese Chriss (8), Josh Jackson (4) in back-to-back drafts just 4-5 years ago."
"Being a fan of a tanking team lets you collect a lot of shit takes about your young talent due to cope.  I had way too much faith in Josh Jackson/Marquese Chriss/Tyler Ulis/Elie Okobo/Alec Fucking Peters.  I also believed that a lineup of Isiah Canaan/Booker/Ariza/Ryan Anderson/Rookie Ayton would be a semi competitive lineup that was more enjoyable than lineups from previous years.  I was wrong, I would rather watch Dragan Bender put up 5 points on 2-6 versus Isiah Canaan and Ryan Anderson trying to play basketball in 2018."
The Warriors subreddit routinely has tribute posts for Marquese Chriss and Omari Spellman that get highly upvoted. Most of the Warriors subreddit was against trading Dlo. Warriors subreddit also thinks Wiggins is better than Siakam. Most fans of teams are extremely delusional about their young players.
"what if we say that Klay is the second best player?  if Steph's new salary is $10M that knocks $74M off the payroll.  steph 10+wiggs 31.6+dray 24+wise 9.2+loon 5.2+poole 2.2+paschall 1.8+JTA 1.7 = $85.7M for 8 players (the others are non-gauranteed).  I'm not sure about the order of operations, but the 7th and 14th picks' contracts combine for i think maybe $8M, so $93.7M.  Cap limit is $112.4M, so they have $18.7M of room to sign a pretty good free agent?  and can also use the full amount of the NTMLE to sign another decent free agent.  and then a bunch of vet min-type salaries (but also a $2.25M TPE from brad wanamaker, and a $1.8M TPE for marquese chriss)."
George's second best player most nights is gonna be Marcus Morris not Marquese Chriss.
I‚Äôm gonna list a group of players and you let me know if you‚Äôd consider them at young core  20 year old Devon Booker  19 year old Marquese Chriss  23 year old Alex Len  19 year old Dragan Bender  21 year old Tyler Ulis
"That doesn‚Äôt really explain much, we hit on Fox and Haliburton and the Suns spent the 4th and 8th picks on Dargan Bender and Marquese Chriss in 2016, and then the 4th pick on Josh Jackson in 2017. The real difference is that since then, the Suns drafted Ayton and Bridges in 2018, then Cam Johnson in 2019, and then signed Cam Payne to a small deal and he is way exceeding his expectations. They took a risk on their young core, including the non-star level young guys, being enough to pair with CP3 and some role playing vets at the right time, and it‚Äôs paid off massively. They are deeper and have a mix of all stars, young role players and vet role players, all possible because of patience making sure not to muddy the contract situation so that they could trade for CP3.    The Kings have some steps toward that core, but we are stuck in the mud with our contract situation. We had to let Bogi walk because we have so much money wrapped up in Buddy and Barnes, so our previous gm put our current gm in a situation in which we need to unload guys before we can really take significant steps forward. Moving Buddy and a few other guys that don‚Äôt fit will be our next big steps, but it likely won‚Äôt feel successful either. We are some years behind where we need to be in order to have an opportunity like the Suns."
Dragan Bender AND Marquese Chriss are warmed up and ready to go!  Technically Tyson Chandler isn't retired either.
Chriss was very good in Golden State but you don‚Äôt take a center second overall and not expect him to quickly climb past Marquese Chriss and Kevon Looney for the starting spot. This was one of the biggest reasons he didn‚Äôt work out for the timberwolves: he didn‚Äôt want to be behind KAT.
I don't think Wiseman was supposed to be a starter this past season. We lost Marquese Chriss right before the season started and he looked great last year with us
Marquese Chriss
"For real though. That box score brings me back to darker days. A starting lineup of Booker, Tyler Ulis, Derrick Jones, Alex Len, and Marquese Chriss. Dudley, Barbosa, and Big Sauce off the bench. Ain't nobody else was gonna score.   70/8/6 with 3 steals is still pretty impressive for a 20yo. Luckily we've seen him have huge performances to win games in the postseason now."
If Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss were decent players we wouldn't have been shitty enough to draft Ayton =)
I mean he went 21/40 from the floor and made 24/26 free throws I think that's pretty efficient. When Marquese Chriss is 1/10 shooting and the other guys on the court are Tyler Ulis and Derrick Jones Jr. you are gonna have to shoulder a pretty big scoring load
"Congrats Suns fans. You had to suffer through a lot these last years. Marquese Chriss, Dragan Bender, etc. You deserve this. Take this damn thing home."
Clips are so fucking dirty. Wish we had Marquese Chriss just so he can let his fists fly
Marquese Chriss
"The Hawks hit gold in the 2017-2019 drafts.  * John Collins (2017, 19th pick) * Trae Young (2018, 5th pick) * Kevin Huerter (2018, 19th pick) * De'Andre Hunter (2019, 4th pick, moved up by trading up with New Orleans) * Cam Reddish (2019, 10th pick, obtained from Luka Traed) * Onyeka Okongwu (2020, 6th pick, TBD how valuable of a contributor he can be)  Getting Taurean Prince (12th pick) and De'Andre Bembry (21st pick) in 2016 could have gone worse, too. Real minefield in that draft, with Papagiannis (13th), Yabusele (16th), Baldwin (17th), Ellenson (18th), Malachi Richardson (22nd), Zizic (23rd), Brice Johnson (25th) lurking. That doesn't even include Dragan Bender (4th), Kris Dunn (5th), Marquese Chriss (8th), and Thon Maker (10th). Bruno Fernando has been a letdown, but he was the 34th pick, so expectations can't be too high.  And somehow, they have positive draft capital moving forward (i.e. didn't sacrifice their picks unnecessarily).  Having all these guys on rookie deals means they were able to sign or acquire a bunch of vets to fill in their roster holes: Gallinari, Bogdanovic, Capela, Lou Will, and Solo. Their cap also allowed them to act as cap relief for other teams. Schlenk has done wonders for this team since his 2017 arrival. He apparently also scouted Draymond when he was working for the Warriors."
"There was a weird case with the Warriors in the case of Lamelo Ball. Remember they thought they were going to have Klay Thompson for the seconds half of the season, so it makes sense to pass on a guard that would have to sit behind Steph, Klay for certain, likely Wiggins (since Lamelo is big enough to play SF), and if he didn't hit, even behind Poole or JTA. Especially when the best center on their team was a toss-up between Marquese Chriss and 6'8"" two-way player Omari Spellman. Let's not forget too that Wiseman is supposed to be able to play a bit on the perimeter."
"Sacramento has had 9 top-8 picks in the last 10 years. At some point it‚Äôs not the league‚Äôs fault, but the teams poor scouting and drafting.   Here‚Äôs a list of players the Kings missed drafting in the last 10 years:  2018:  Selected Marvin Bagley.  Missed: Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgeous Alexander  2016:  Selected Marquese Chriss.  Missed: Damontas Sabonis, Caris LeVert, Pascal Siakam, Dejounte Murray  2015:  Selected Willie Cauley-Stein.  Missed: Devon Booker, Myles Turner, Terry Rozier,  2014:  Selected Nick Stauskas  Missed: Elfrid Payton, TJ Warren, Clint Capella, Bogdon Bogdonovic, Joe Harris, Nikola Jokic  At some point, there‚Äôs a reason why the teams have sucked for 20 years. The Kings have had 15 years worth of lottery picks, with only one or two nice pieces to show for it"
"Nope. The lottery and the NBA for that matter is a lot like life.  It‚Äôs not fair.   When we start creating rules to allow for equal outcome rather than equal opportunity, we are opening up a can of worms that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to come back from.   You want to complain about the system? How about complain about the front offices of the Kings and Magic that can‚Äôt build a winning team after many years of top 10 picks.   It‚Äôs not the Cavs/Raptors fault that the Kings drafted Marvin Bagley, Marquese Chriss, Willie Cauley-Stein, Nik Stauskas, Ben McLemore and Thomas Robinson with top 10 picks in the recent years.  It‚Äôs also not their fault that the Magic selected Mo Bamba, Mario Hezonja and a bunch of good but not great players for them like Jonathon Issac, Aaron Gordon and Victor Oladipo all in the top 10."
"Sure, but that‚Äôs not what the other guy said.  He said that the Suns were a trash organization until CP3 got there.  The bubble run showed that Phoenix‚Äôs culture had changed. People look at Monty Williams and they see a dude who won‚Äôt cuss, not a guy who led this team and created a system and scheme for these players. They see the roster created by James Jones, and they forget that it was betting on Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson and Dragan Bender before he started reshaping it.  What I‚Äôm saying is that CP3 had a huge effect, but that he wasn‚Äôt the only person who made a difference, and that the big culture shift began before he got there."
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas ‚Äì New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama ‚Äì Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France ‚Äì New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington ‚Äì Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest ‚Äì L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
Kings First Pick past decade  2020 Pick 12 - Tyrese Haliburton  2019 Pick 40 - Justin James  2018 Pick 2 - Marvin Bagley  2017 Pick 5 - De'Aaron Fox  2016 Pick 8 - Marquese Chriss  2015 Pick 6 - Willie Cauley-Stein  2014 Pick 8 - Nik Stauskas  2013 Pick 7 - Ben McLemore  2012 Pick 5 - Thomas Robinson  2011 Pick 7 - Bismack Biyombo
Same Ibaka who choked tf out of Marquese Chriss for talking some trash wanted absolutely no part of MWP for almost taking his teammate‚Äôs head off.
Call Marquese Chriss to body slam some sense into him
The one about the guy in his house and he pump fakes then Marquese Chriss comes flying through his ceiling trying to block it
"He was great in college. 14th wasn't a reach at the time, but it's a cautionary tale about overvaluing production as a senior in college when the player is older and more experienced than the competition. It just didn't translate to the NBA.  Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Thon Maker, Taurean Prince, and Georgios Papagiannis all had similar or worse NBA careers than he has had and they were drafted ahead of him. It's just the nature of the draft that not every guy is suited for the NBA/not every team is good at developing prospects. Not the worst 14th pick ever imo"
Where is Marquese Chriss these days. Dude went from All Rookie to out of the league without a rookie extension.
Marquese Chriss Paul George Hill
I wouldn't be shocked to see Marquese Chriss come back. They really did seem to like him as a person and he just had a bad break with the injury last year. As the 3rd guy behind Looney and Wiseman he would be fine.
Steph plays 36 mpg at point guard. Just need 12 combined minutes of Jordan Poole or even Andre to run the 2nd unit. Meanwhile the only trustworthy center we have is Looney and he cant play more than 25 mpg (since we dont want to run Draymond into the ground by playing him heavy C minutes). We have no idea how effective Wiseman will be and if he isn't playable we need a contingency plan. Marquese Chriss would be a decent choice
Oh didn't see that one. Marquese Chriss is still my top choice for that last roster spot
"I don't trust Wiseman at this point and Looney can't play heavy minutes. There's a reason we were so much better with Wiseman off the floor. I guess Bjelica might steal a few minutes but that's a defensive nightmare. Draymond will always be our best center but like you said, that's only when it really matters. I just want a veteran center like Robin Lopez or Marquese Chriss who can grab a few boards and maybe block a shot here and there."
Wait Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss were lottery picks??
I'm told the Heat are eyeing Marquese Chriss with their next move
THAT BETTER BE MARQUESE CHRISS' MUSIC
"Marquese Chriss is obviously signing with the Warriors, so no need to put him here."
I think Javale would be solid. People are forgetting about Marquese Chriss. He was finally finding his role and doing it quite well until his injury last year. I would take Chriss over Javale actually.
Marquese Chriss Paul George Gervin
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
&gt; released Marquese Chriss  You mean traded chriss for cash because he had a broken leg?
This is the same dude that released Marquese Chriss and Jordan Bell for doing dumb shit then re-signed them both. Not to mention giving headcase Kelly Oubre 15M to throw a temper tantrum
"I'm convinced they were doing their best to piss Boogie off  They draft WCS in 2015, a rim-running center that doesn't shoot and was also already 22. If they were dead-set on an old rookie, and it had to be a big cos Kangz then Kaminsky was still available  The next year, they took Marquese Chriss with the 8th pick. For whatever fucking reason they then traded Chriss to Phoenix for Papagiannis (another big man) &amp; Labissi√®re (another fucking big man). The only reason this trade isn't as criticized as it should be is because they got back the draft rights of Bogdan Bogdanovic."
"I'm gonna assume we have Looney and try to get Marquese Chriss back, but there might be a rule issue or he might get a better offer. I think with that 1-4 we can pick up a cheap decent center to soak up minutes because we are closing with Draymond or Looney at the end anyways."
Marquese Chriss Paul George PapaGiannis Antetokounmpo
"They could really use a guy like, say, Marquese Chriss"
Somebody get Marquese Chriss on the phone
"Yeah, Greg Papa is pretty funny, tells it like it is though, which is most likely why Mark Davis made the unpopular decision to move on from Greg being the voice of the Raiders.   And as far as the Warriors other weapons that year, it was Eric Paschall, and on occasion, a sprinkling of Marquese Chriss"
" Marquese Chriss, Quinn Cook, Patrick Patterson, Dennis Smith Jr.  Not a bad group to pick the 15th guy off the bench."
"Cries in Phoenix Suns.  We took Dragan Bender 4th above Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield.  We took Marquese Chriss 8th above Domontas Sabonis, Paskal Siakam and Caris Lavert.  We took Tyler Ulis 34th above Malcolm Brogdon."
"really, superwashed DJ instead of Marquese Chriss???"
I don‚Äôt disagree with your point but saying this on a post about a Marquese Chriss signing got a laugh
We drafted Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss in the same year. I feel like that‚Äôs gotta have some sort of compound effect.
"Marquese Chriss looked like he was turning a corner and would have been our starting center last year had he not gotten injured. I hope a team gives him a chance, he is really good"
"My best pick for last few years would be 2016/17 Suns, when they had Chriss Marquese, Derrick Jones and Jared Dudley. Marquese was always looking to instigate something.   If those three can't make anything close to malice at the palace happened, nothing will."
"Drafting Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss in the same draft and saying to my friends something like ""at least one will hit and if they both hit, we have our frontcourt of the future.""  Also, arguing with people about Bledsoe and Knight being a top 5 backcourt in the league."
I remember when this veteran presence set the lovely example of shoving Ricky Rubio in the backcourt followed by Marquese Chriss taking a cheapshot at Rubio right after.  This dude is a lame corny grifter and has been for years.
An injured Marquese Chriss asks for 20 million
"I've got one. On draft day of the 2016 NBA draft:  Phoenix receives Sacramento's 2016 first round pick (#8)  Sacramento receives two 2016 firsts (#13 and #28), a 2020 2nd round pick, and the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic.  It's not lopsided by any means. I think it would have been a wash if Bogdanovic never came to the league. However, the picks ended up just being a whole lot of bleh.  That 8th pick was Marquese Chriss, who has flashed potential on the Warriors fairly recently, but got pretty badly injured and hasn't played in a while.  That 13th pick was Georgios Papagiannis. We know how that one ended up.  The 28th pick was Skal Labissiere, who was almost projected for the lottery, but kept falling, and apparently for good reason. He's not on a team anymore.  The 2020 second round pick was eventually traded to Memphis on draft day 2020, and became Xavier Tillman (traded for Robert Woodard and a 2022 second rounder). Tillman's a solid rotation player.  -------------  Out of anything, the pick of Georgios Papagiannis is the biggest headscratcher out of this whole trade. Obviously, this isn't at the magnitude of picking Bagley over Luka, and that 2016 draft was kind of crap in the late lottery and mid first round. Honestly this was just a lose-lose for everyone. Both teams had been gunning to find their next solid big man. In recent history, the Suns used major draft capital to select Alex Len (2013), Dragan Bender (2016), Marquese Chriss (2016), and finally Deandre Ayton (2018), while the Kings had picked Thomas Robinson (2012), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Papagiannis (2016), and most recently, Marvin Bagley (2019). House SunKings indeed."
Marquese Chriss would be a top 5 centre at some point in his career.
"if you listen to McDonough every good pick was McDonough's idea and every bust was Sarver's idea. He's quick to point out that he drafted Booker and Ayton but is pretty quiet about Alex Len, Tyler Ennis, Dragan Bender, trading up with Bogdan Bogdanovic for Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ulis, Josh Jackson, and Elie Okobo. McD was even sniping the Mikal Bridges pick saying he wanted to get Sahi instead when bridges had his shooting hitch but now is suddenly all in on Mikal now that hes proven to be one of the best 2 way wings in the league. You cant trust anything this guy says about the suns  His tenure oversaw the absolute worst period of history for a franchise that had never been a bottom dweller but if you listen to the guy on twitter youd think hes a genius. Its pretty damning that the team was turned into a finals contender two years after he was fired with 80% roster turnover."
Marquese Chriss maybe?
Why would they get rid of Marquese Chriss? He can mix it up in the post.
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
"I would love to keep Marquese Chriss because we need a 3rd big, and waive CJ Elleby"
Dawg how are you gonna say that when the suns literally drafted Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss with top 10 picks in the same draft üòÇüòÇ
I was also thinking of Marquese Chriss. He was almost out of the league before signing with GS and then looked like a solid rotational big man 2 seasons. Would've had a solid season last year if he hadn't gotten hurt
I was upset the Raps took Jakob Poeltl over him. I have never questioned or got emotional over draft picks since as I have no clue and that just proved it. I was also mad that Marquese Chriss went off the board just before as well.
"maybe to you. I am actually surprised bc the suns just became good overnight. To me, he and DA make the past 10 years worth it. The morris brothers felony assault, josh jackson, dragan bender and marquese chriss, the corpse of tyson chandler, etc."
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael ‚ÄúCurious Mike‚Äù Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
"I‚Äôm not here to say we aren‚Äôt the worst, but I would like to throw in consideration for the 2016 and 2017 drafts for the Phoenix Suns. With two top 10 picks in 2016, they drafted Dragan Bender at 4 (in front of Jamal Murray and Buddy Hield) and Marquese Chriss at 8 (in front of Sabonis). In 2017, with the 4th pick, they selected Josh Jackson in front of DeAaron Fox,  Bam Adebayo and many other players that have been more notable. Those Kings picks in 2011 and 2012 are still worse IMO because the talent in each drafted was better than 2016, though blowing two top 10 picks in one draft and then missing on Jackson in 2017 is a very rough go."
"DENVER: Marquese Chriss, Bam Adebayo, Troy Brown Jr., Leandro Bolmaro; other 1st rounders would be Guerschon Yabusele and Caris LeVert"
"Kris Dunn, Elfrid Payton, Marquese Chriss, Goga Bitadze."
Marquese Chriss Paul George Karl Marlone
You could maybe put Marquese Chriss in front of Chris Paul but it‚Äôs obviously spelled differently.
Watching the Pistons gives me the same feeling i got when I watched those Dragan Bender-Marquese Chriss led Suns teams
"If Tatum can take the likes of Tyler Ulis, Dragan Bender, marquese chriss, and the corpse of Tyson Chandler to the playoffs than he's probably better than prime LeBron. The guy you're replying to is a dumbass, but you're comparing apples and oranges when it comes to the level of talent of the squads that Tatum and Book had to play with"

"Duh, everyone knows the best way to develop young talent is to be one of the worst teams of all time with zero veteran leadership and poor coaching. That's why so many of the Sun's young players from 2015 to 2018 developed into All-stars.  You know, those household names Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyler Ullis, Josh Jackson, Alan Williams, and plenty of others that run the league to this day."
There‚Äôs a big difference between Marquese Chriss and LeBron.
"I watched us through our 19-20 season lol. And hence last season seemed like a major upgrade in all positions.  ## Fun Fact: Of the 20 players who got minutes for the Warriors that season, 11 of them are out of the league this season.     Our guards were:    * rookie Jordan Poole (who was really league worst)    * Ky Bowman * Alec Burks (who played well and got traded mid-season) * DLo (played only half the games that season)   * Damien Lee  Forwards:    * GRob3 * Paschall   * Dray    Bigs:    * Marquese Chriss   * Omari Spellman   * Willie Cauley-Stein (also traded away mid-season)"
"well considering that the Warriors have had pretty low draft picks in the Kerr era, they‚Äôve done alright with Jordan Poole, and given other teams‚Äô discarded players (Marquese Chriss, Gary Payton II) some decent looks bodes well. But i‚Äôll agree with you, before Jordan Poole‚Äôs recent rise, I was disappointed about our player development, until I realized late draft picks don‚Äôt usually pan out. They‚Äôve taken steps this year to shore up the development by hiring the coach that mentored Jokic and Kenny Atkinson as an asset coach. I have faith moving forward, they seem to have realized that they have incoming fresh young talent and it‚Äôs the cheapest way of adding good players to a maxed out roster."
"We've had to see Ayton show off a post move every 20 games and then previous to that the likes of Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss, Tyson Chandler, and Alex Len.  Kaminsky showing his post moves for us is like cavemen discovering fire."

"Ibaka, Ingram and Marquese Chriss will absolutely throw down."

"To add: He traded Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph for Harrison Barnes, then signed Harrison to a contract that Harrison has played up to for most of the time we‚Äôve had him.   Also he didn‚Äôt just trade for Bogdan, he traded Marquese Chriss for Bogdan and three attempts to draft good players (lol). Signed Bjelica before Bjelica could exit the country. I mean still not saying he was good overall, but he definitely did some things right"
"That face when Alex Len is 100x more valuable than the 4 other top-10 picks (Jalen Smith \[10\], Josh Jackson \[4\], Dragan Bender \[4\], Marquese Chriss \[7\]) in the past 15 years the Suns have had combined.  Apparently the Suns just need to draft in the low-teens from now on.  * Cam Johnson -- 11th pick 2019 * Devin Booker -- 13th pick 2015 * TJ Warren -- 14th pick 2014 * Kendall Marshall -- 13th pick 2012  (Fucking eww, never knew why we did this) * Markieff Morris -- 13th pick 2011 (Even with him being a dickhead, he's still a serviceable NBA player) * Earl Clark -- 14th pick 2009 (We held out hope for so long on him) * Robin Lopez -- 15th pick 2008 (We bitched about him so much until we lost him and had Len as a starter, who we bitched about until we lost him and had continuous garbage as starters until Ayton)"
"They also traded the rights to Bogdan, 13th, and 28th for the 8th pick in 2016... Then picked Marquese Chriss."
"I don't think so, no.  Even fucking Anthony Bennett, Marquese Chriss, and Georgios Papagiannis got their 3rd-year options."
