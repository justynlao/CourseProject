"Mahomes is Curry. Tannehill is Beal, since both weren't that good in their early years but now are getting recognized. Brady is lebron because rangz and GOAT tier. Rodgers is giannis, Wisconsin connection and both are loyal to their franchise. Lamar Jackson is luka, both got the physical tools but both can be better at throwing and shooting, respectively. Deshaun Watson is harden, both are/ were disgruntled. Kirk cousins us Demarcus cousins (lol) both were better in their earlier days and now are a shell of their former selves. Baker is kemba because both have good leadership qualities and sometimes get overlooked by other guys and yet they still ball out. Derek carr is LMA since they been playing for ages it seems like. Allen is jokic. Wilson is Durant. Herbert is tatum since they are both young franchise players for their teams. Matt Ryan is westbrook both guys get tunnell vision."
"&gt; This is most blatant in the NFL when #1 drafts consistently get dropped into the worst team in the league (it being the worst team for a reason), then cannot develop and then get railroaded out of the league.  I think that's more that those guys just suck. NFL #1 picks are more likely to become all-stars than NBA #1 picks.   NFL #1 pick all-stars since 2000:   - All-stars (15): Kyler Murray, Myles Garrett, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Jadaveon Clowney, Eric Fisher, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton, Matt Stafford, Jake Long, Mario Williams, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, Mike Vick  - Non-all-stars (6): Joe Burrow, Baker Mayfield, Sam Bradford, Jamarcus Russell, David Carr, Courtney Brown  NBA #1 overall picks since 2000:   - All-stars (12): Ben Simmons, Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose, Andrew Bogut, Dwight Howard, Lebron James, Yao Ming, Kenyon Martin  - Non-all-stars (9): Anthony Edwards, Zion Williamson, Deandre Ayton, Markelle Fultz, Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Andrea Bargnani, Kwame Brown  Zion seems like a pretty sure bet to become an all-star in the future, but I could say the same for Burrow.   &gt; That's why the best NFL quarterbacks nowadays are mid-round picks and late round picks  Only 2 of them: Wilson and Brady. 4 if you wanna include ""good not great"" QBs like Kirk Cousins and Dak Prescott.   Meanwhile the 1st round QBs include: Patrick Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, Deshaun Watson, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Phillip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan, Ryan Tannehill, Justin Herbert. That's already 10, not including any who were listed above as #1 overall picks.   Then you also have Drew Brees and Derek Carr as early 2nd rounders (ie, not midround picks)."
"this is the NBA equivalent of Matt Ryan yelling ""GET FUCKING SET!"""
"Yeah.. so why aren’t you telling people to call him Matthew Ryan and not Matt Ryan? After all, Matt Damon was famous first so he’s the only one that gets to shorten his name"
Except Matt Damonhas been acting way before Matt Ryan made the NFL
Matt is Matthew Damon. Stop it with this Matt Ryan nonsense  It’s his name dude
"Why settle with 1 good SF when you can roll through 20 Small Forwards?        Here is a list I made a while ago, highlighting starters  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Ryan Gomes** 2. **Caron Butler** 3. Bobby Simmons 4. **Matt Barnes** 5. Grant Hill 6. Lamar Odom 7. **Jared Dudley** 8. Danny Granger 9. Antawn Jamison 10. Stephen Jackson 11. Hedo Turkoglu 12. Reggie Bullock 13. Dahntay Jones 14. Jordan Hamilton 15. **Paul Pierce** 16. Lance Stephenson 17. **Jeff Green** 18. **Wesley Johnson** 19. Josh Smith 20. **Luc Mbah a Moute**"
Indeed. Dak is a fringe top 10 QB in the NFL. His ceiling is one Matt Ryan type MVP season as an outlier but only if the stars aligned perfectly for him and I really don't see that happening in Dallas.
"He’s far from my favorite but there are a lot worse. Have you seen that dude Ryan Hollins? He raises his voice anytime he talks and has the most punchable face. And this next one is controversial but imo Matt Barnes is terrible. He doesn’t know when to breath when he talks, so he spews everything out like a middle schooler rushing through their presentation"
What is how far Matt Ryan threw it in the second half of the Super Bowl?
I don't see how anyone would think KD would get worse without a good guard. It's not like football where Julio being out makes Matt Ryan terrible
He always does.  He also said “worst case senario” Mac Jones turns into Matt Ryan lmao
"First of all you are essentially giving a bunch of Ben Shapiro takes which is only the neocon portion of the republican party. Sonnie is an example of a republican that isn't a warhawk:  https://mobile.twitter.com/SonnieJohnson.  Second, I guess we see outrage differently. Wondering if there was a fair trial due to media coverage and public official comments doesn't sound like outrage to me. None of them declared he was innocent either although I suspect Ryan and Matt believe he was.  Most replies to these tweets are those that disagree too. And this is clearly anecdotal, but I know many conservatives and liberals and all thought he was guilty."
"Ryan Fournier saying the jury was tampered with: https://twitter.com/RyanAFournier/status/1384616786050658304  Ryan Fournier saying the trial was not fair: https://twitter.com/RyanAFournier/status/1384619108289978382  Matt Walsh saying the president pressured the jury into their verdict: https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1384600342306959360  Matt Walsh saying 'the mob' pressured the jury into their verdict: https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1384615587742113792  Michael Knowles saying the verdict is not just: https://twitter.com/michaeljknowles/status/1384701267088400393  Jenna Ellis saying the trial was not fair: https://twitter.com/JennaEllisEsq/status/1384708140839620609  Idk man just look around at conservative talking heads, if you don't see the outrage then I don't think you're really looking"
Naa fuck that. Im not upvoting that smut. Hurts more now that Julio left us and Arthur is going to let Matt Ryan keep doing whatever the fuck he's doing until he dies.
"&gt;. Steph would have more attempts than most teams in the 80s they’d have no idea what to do with him.  They would have beat the shit out of him, grabbed onto him, knocked him the F out after he went up in the air.  Then you get hurt/tired.  I reccomend you look up how teams defended Michael Jordan.    ""If Michael was at the point, we forced him left and doubled him. If he was on the left wing, we went immediately to a double team from the top. If he was on the right wing, we went to a slow double team. He could hurt you equally from either wing—hell, he could hurt you from the hot-dog stand—but we just wanted to vary the look. And if he was on the box, we doubled with a big guy. **The other rule was, any time he went by you, you had to nail him. If he was coming off a screen, nail him. We didn't want to be dirty—I know some people thought we were—but we had to make contact and be very physical.**""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Rules  It gave Jordan Trouble.  It'd give any NBA player in the league right now trouble.  It'd give any NBA player in history trouble.  Jordan is so great because he did what he did in THAT atmosphere.  Jordan's stats aren't leagues above other NBA players today... but he's considered better because offense was harder back then. Want to know why teams don't employ ""Jordan Rules"" anymore to defend superstars like Steph Curry?  Because you'd immediately foul of a game, and all your players would get ejected, and given flagrant 2's for hard fouls.  Do you FINALLY understand that NBA basketball back then was different?  And thus you have to view the stats through different lenses?  I mean, lets try this.  Do you agree that in the NFL we should view Dan Marino's stats through a different lens than a guy like Matt Ryan?  Is Matt Ryan MASSIVELY better than John Elway or Joe Montana, because his passing yards and passing TDs is way higher?  Of course not.  They played in different ages of football with completely different rules.  It's the same with Bird and Curry... do you now agree?"
You’d be amazed at how many casual Falcons fans blame Matt Ryan for that game.
"At least Julio and Matt Ryan weren't to blame for the chokes they suffered. Good grief, I think Joel will break his hand tonight from killing ben simmons lol"
"Young was incredible, Matt ryan should drop the matty ice nickname"
"Fair enough, I had a long day.  I think the GOAT case is much harder to make. IMO Brady got a lot of help from defenses &amp; coaching but it's hard to deny seven rings. But the question wasn't #1, it's #1-3. If you're going by stats, Rodgers is clearly in the convo. If you're going by SB wins, there's only four QBs with three or more - Brady, Montana, Aikman, and Bradshaw. I'm assuming you're not going to give the nod to Troy or Terry, so it can't just be about Super Bowls. (Or maybe you do think it's all about Super Bowls, in which case we're not going to get anywhere.)  There's a bunch of dudes with two SBs but only a few have a real argument for being better than Rodgers - Peyton (who was clearly carried to his last win by the defense) and... Starr if you're generous on era adjustments &amp; history of the game? Maybe Elway? Either way, clearly a conversation.  If ""enough in the playoffs"" means winning not just Super Bowls but winning playoff games, I mean, Rodgers is great in the playoffs despite some high-profile losses. He's #4 all time in playoff passer rating behind Starr, Kurt Warner, and Matt Ryan. Tons of memorable games (Dallas 2014 &amp; 2016 definitely come to mind, as does Philly 2010 and the two wins from the last two years), an absolute shelacking of the 1 seed in 2010 en route to his only Super Bowl, and even in the losses he frequently played great (I'm thinking of the two losses to AZ in '09 and '15, the latter of which he took to overtime despite his top 5 receivers being out). Definitely some clunkers too but everyone has those.  Tangentially, I honestly think there's a pretty good case for Marino as better than Rodgers and a top 3, but he only appeared in one SB and he got creamed so I'm assuming he's not on your list.  At minimum, it's clear to me that Rodgers is in the conversation. As a Packers fan who's watched 90% of games since about 2007, it's a frustrating one because if a ball had bounced a slightly different way like three times the whole narrative might be completely different. But if's and but's etc."
"yeah everyone craps on the falcons, not Matt Ryan"
"It's not about one player choking it's the collective team effort of Choking.   Like I find it hard to think that Matt Ryan choked in the Superbowl considering he threw the ball to only where Julio can make that catch. I think Matt actually finished that Superbowl with a 144.7 passing rating but it's the collective team effort of Choking i.e. Devonta Freeman missing chip block, Jake Matthews holding, and defense being completely worn out and Vic Beasley not not intercepting that pass in the end zone.   It's a a team effort."
"Campazzo, Morris, and Rivers weren't trash when they sent Lillard home. They aren't trash when they played the Suns.  It's not like the Nuggets went out there with the equivalent of Ryan Lindley or Matt Flynn* at QB. Morris is good. Facu is good.  It would have been more competitive but it's not as if we beat a bunch of bums. This team just beat a good Blazers team and got Will Barton back.  EDIT Matt Flynn, Matt Moore is good"
Nikola is gonna be with 2016 Matt Ryan in terms of MVPs who years from now you look at and say “there’s no way they won mvp” then you look at their seasons and go “yeah they deserved that”
For real they fucking did it was Haskins who had like 200 total rushing yards in College. Just watch some tapes you will see these guys are god damn statues in the pocket. Matt Ryan will scramble for more yards than them.
The Matt Ryan eta Falcons playoff mantra. Minus 2009 and 2012 when he lost to the runner up lol
"2 rings goes a long way for a QB. Not many have done that before.  Also, while I get your point, Big Ben's peak season, peak 3 seasons, and peak 5 seasons were all better than Rivers. These guys are in a different class when it comes to their career success.  I think a better comp for Rivers would be Matt Ryan, who had a higher peak, but no rings to go with a long career."
"Matt Ryan is from the Philadelphia area, looks like a win win"
Matt Ryan is in danger
Whats with Atlanta fans and talking shit out of nowhere when their team is good? Same shit happened when the Atlanta Falcons were good that one year Matt Ryan won MVP.  Shit talking everywhere from /r/nfl. Then they started to suck and the fans disappeared
That's what everyone says about Matt Ryan...
No way. He's a poor man's Matt Ryan. They're both good but Ryan has always been better.
I ain't using the phrase lifer no more unless it is Matt Ryan. I can't love anymore after how Julio is doing us.
Matt Ryan taking vigorous notes
Totally forgot about that! That was hype.reminded me of rookie year Matt Ryan game winning drive in 17 seconds
"&gt; I never said Matt was 100% problem I overtly said I actually like Matt. I'm arguing his era overall for most part to Falcons fans represent failure. This is about image. Whether or not he deserve the blame and honestly he doesn't he personally has been amazing for the Falcons, but with all lack of success people get tired and want to start a new chapter. And Since he is the top guy most of blame by fault is going to Ryan now.  So, what you are saying is, that Matt is a scapegoat for idiotic, fairweather fans? I can get behind that."
"Before anything else I'll ask.. Why is Michael Vick considered a better QB? It's not that black fans prefer him, they genuinely think he is worlds better than Matt Ryan and would have won at least one Superbowl(usually more) if he got the same supposed chances Ryan has. You are on a completely different train of thought than I am here, addressing Matt as a somewhat uninformed fan instead of going into it with an inherent bias.   And again, that's not legitimate criticism. Matt has done more than enough to win games in recent memory and if you think otherwise you either aren't watching or have an inherent bias against him. If we didn't have Matt Ryan this franchise would be in the literal dumpster, after Petrino ran out we were predicted to be a trash franchise for years to come, and yet we draft Matt and he immediately breathes life into the team and leads us toward a much brighter future.   It is beyond weird that you think Matt Ryan's time with the Falcons somehow represents failure when.. bro, do you even know our history? Bottom feeder franchise our entire existence with the occasional flash of talent(Grits Blitz, Primetime) or overperforming season('98 Superbowl fluke appearance), we get exciting for a few years with Vick, but still aren't actually good, and then Matt comes in and not long after we are a perennial contender. The Matt Ryan era is the most successful time our franchise has ever known, and the fact that you seem to genuinely think otherwise is embarrassing for me to read."
"I just said dude has only lead Falcons to the playoffs 2 times in last 8 year and first line you said ""What is the legit criticism?""  wtf..........   I never said Matt was 100% problem I overtly said I actually like Matt. I'm arguing his era overall for most part to Falcons fans represent failure. This is about image. Whether or not he deserve the blame and honestly he doesn't he personally has been amazing for the Falcons, but with all lack of success people get tired and want to start a new chapter. And Since he is the top guy most of blame by fault is going to Ryan now.   As far as Drew Brees he still has a better playoff appearance ratio then Matt. And the fact he actually won a super bowl means a lot. Again this about image.  Dude won Superbowl after Katrina that had mean a lot for N.O. If Matt won yes that might have change a lot of his perception to have that parade in Atlanta.   My point its not because he's white that idea of even thinking is stupid, It's because he's not married to Success. His highs have been amazing but of his years as the guy has been so and so to just bad."
"What is the legit criticism? Name one season where stats and tape back up what you're saying. You say I'm arguing with emotion and yet you insist Matt Ryan is somehow the problem? Football isn't basketball lmao, one player doesn't automatically win you games, I don't care who it is. You think Tom Brady wins 7 Superbowls with an average coach and roster? Drew Brees is considered a top 5 all time QB by many and only won a single Superbowl(and even that one has a bit of a red mark thanks to Bountygate), and missed the playoffs more times than he made it. Is he overrated trash as well?"
"And the fact that you think Matt Ryan is the issue proves my point. Ryan put up 28 points in that Superbowl, trusted his OC, and the team let him down. He put them in field goal position to seal the game and then his RB failed him, and then his LT failed him. Not to mention they actually almost went back to the NFC title game the next season if Julio would've just caught the ball, but apparently you didn't actually watch them play that season."
"Bruh it's literally just the truth why always make it a personal ""hee hee here's le racist dogwhistle"" thing. Matt Ryan gets paid millions of dollars to play fucking football, he can handle racism, he's not a victim. That doesn't mean that it isn't there.  I know they don't teach critical thinking anymore but I'd like to expect better of people at least sometimes, especially when something is do blatant and obvious."
It doesn't. Matt Ryan is a Mediocre QB.
Matt Ryan is a Mediocre QB.
"That's not the major reason why Matt Ryan is disliked in Atlanta, it's because of his skin color. A combination of being a white guy coming after Vick on top of the reasons why Vick had to go led to a huge number of black fans never ""forgiving"" him for existing. Being a traditional pocket passer just adds onto that and makes his haters feel a sense of legitimacy even though it's just racism."
Matt Ryan is a boring white guy. If he won two straight Super Bowls a bunch of our fans would probably still take a 40-year old Mike Vick over him.
facts. even though Matt Ryan won mvp and went to the SB he isn’t loved like Vick once was. Atlanta loves flashy players and I can’t blame em.
"I can understand how that comes off as a bit of a coarse analysis, but I still think it’s fair to think that somebody like Matt Ryan should be more successful when it truly matters. He’s capable of it surely. Also recognize that Matt Ryan is a far more mature athlete than either Luka or Trae and has had far more opportunities to help the Falcons succeed in important moments. Once Luka and Trae have reached that point in their career, if they have that problem too it will then be fair for me to criticize them for it too."
"I can agree with that part of it, I was just pushing back on Matt Ryan having a ""limited ceiling"" when his ceiling was literally being the most valuable player in the NFL.  I'm just arguing semantics at this point honestly, I just like to stick up for Matt."
"Well let‘s be honest, the only reason I’m comparing Luka to Trae is because we literally drafted Luka and traded him for Trae. Luka will be in that Brady/Mahomes tier and Trae could at some point be in a Matt Ryan sort of tier.  For me to criticize the Hawks for trading a Brady-tier player for a Ryan-tier player is completely reasonable."
"Matt Ryan is immensely talented, and is among the most high-volume quarterbacks in the league, but he makes lots of mistakes too. I don’t think it’s unfair to say someone of his talent-level could be more clutch. He deserved MVP when he got it but he has only really had one season of that caliber in his career (although 2018 was pretty close)."
"Matt Ryan haters are good because you know you can disregard any of their future opinions, saves time."
"No I agree. I respect Matt Ryan, but he has a limited ceiling, even if he’s been relatively consistent.  I don’t necessarily think it would have been better for the Hawks to keep Luka, because like I said, I think the team and the culture of the fans jives much better with Trae. I don’t think I’m out of pocket saying we probably should’ve kept him though, the kid is undeniably incredible."
I mean Matt Ryan is a better quarterback than Mike Vick but no one gives a shit about him.  Also can you imagine the Luka stans in the Hawks sub. 🤮
Yeah this argument gives me Matt Ryan vs. Mike Vick vibes.
Keep me out of that mess. YOU hate Matt Ryan because you're peanut brained. I'm ride or die with Matty Ice
We hate Matt Ryan because he is boring. Fanbase would take current Michael Vick over current Matt Ryan if we had the choice. 😂
"Holy shit, I never thought of Matt Ryan hate that way before but it makes perfect sense."
"Honestly, from what I've seen from Doncic, we would have come around on him too. Atlanta loves swagger more than it loves winning. That's why half our fanbase hates Matt Ryan lol."
RYAN AND MATT LIVE
Just go look at the way Matt Ryan is treated
"Watching Bucs playoffs games and hearing Antoine Winfield's name, at first I was like man, good for the ol vet still playing well, gotta be getting up there. Turns out it's his son and the og retired like 8 years ago lol. Also, when I first started watching football in '95, one of my fave players on the Lions was Brett Perriman, who had over 100 catches, about 1,500 yds and 9 tds that season. His son Breshad is now a WR for the Lions, and when I read that it aged me like Matt Damon at the end of *Saving Private Ryan.*"
Idk just spitballing but:  Luka Doncic  Dirk Nowitzki  Brian Scalabrine  Tyler Herro  Alex Caruso  Duncan Robinson  Larry Bird  John Stockton  Bob Cousy  Bob Pettit  Mark Eaton  John Havlicek  Mike Bibby  Maxi Kleber  Jordan Farmar  Zach Collins  Jusuf Nurkic  Nikola Jokic  Frank Kaminsky  Dario Saric  Joe Ingles  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Bojan Bogdanovic  Klay Thompson  Alen Smailagic  Svi Mykhailuk  David Lee  Arvydas Sabonis  Domantas Sabonis  Pau Gasol  Marc Gasol  Luke Kennard  Dragan Bender  Alex Len  Ricky Rubio  Cole Aldrich  Cedi Osman  Mike Dunleavy  Mike Miller  Bill Laimbeer  Tommy Heinsohn  Kelly Olynyk  Kevin Love  Ryan Anderson  Grayson Allen  Zydrunas Ilgauskas  Nikola Vucevic  Mario Hezonja  Boban Marjanovic  Davis Bertans  Gordon Hayward  Matt Thomas  Chase Budinger  Steve Kerr  Luc Longley  Jeff Hornacek  Brian Cardinal  Chris Kaman  Steve Blake  Tomas Satoransky  Jakob Poeltl  Manu Ginobili  Luke Babbitt  Kevin Huerter  JJ Barea  Dan Majerle  Tom Chambers  Tyler Zeller  Cody Zeller  Mason Plumlee  Tyler Hansbrough  Sam Merrill  Nico Mannion  Peja Stojakovic  Pete Maravich  Those are just my top 75 idk they all have something about them that makes them great
Hawks finna get Matt Ryan in there to pick up some Assists
When did Matt Ryan get arrested?
Matt Ryan is in prison?
I know. I explained that then deal being backloaded makes it that he’s making 43 and 48 million at 30 and 31. And the percentage of the cap is so high because average to above average QBS are being paid ridiculously high. Kirk Cousins will be paid 48 million next year. Jimmy Garropolo will be paid 24 million the next two years. Matt Ryan 26 million. Ben Roethlishburger 25 million. These guys are increasing the average market which is why dak got paid so much. Dak will probably be above average at 31 and will be used to get another above average QB paid big money. Never ending cycle.
"Ryan Hollins, Kendrick Perkins, Matt Barnes, Gilbert Arenas, Jalen Rose  All analyst team  If you dont know who Ryan Hollins is, please look up his analyst lowlights on youtube they are amazing, he is the biggest waste of 7 feet of all time"
Case in point. The city loved Kyle Korver more than anyone else on that 60 win team cause they were boring unfortunately.  Same thing with Vick and Matt Ryan.
"A lot of them use to play under him. Perkins, Matt Barnes, Paul Pierce, Ryan Hollins."
"It’s looking more like a Win/Win, Luka wouldn’t fit in in Atlanta just look at the hate an MVP matt Ryan gets, and Trae is loved cause he fits the culture. Mavs are known for being high on euro guys and Luka fits that well. Luke might be the better player, but no Hawks fan is upset with our teams position compared to the Mavs position right now."
He goes out of his way to shit on the Falcons and Matt Ryan all the time too.....yet he's from Atlanta and grew up a Hawks and Falcons fan
"I think Falcons have this next year to make one last run with this core, but we should be going into full rebuild mode after this season. I always try to stay optimistic with the Falcons, I have a ton of trust in Matt Ryan, and am very excited about Arthur Smith, but I think our ceiling is 9-8 or 8-9 this season.  We'll see though, I think the NFL is the best league for surprises, so maybe this squad can sneak into the playoffs."
That loss was 0% on matt ryan
Blaming Matt Ryan for that loss is like blaming Joel Embiid for the Sixers loss tonight.
I don't think you want Matt Ryan clutch in championship situations
funnily enough matt ryan is the only nfl mvp since 1999 to still be in super bowl contention at the end of the 4th quarter
You talking as if Luka is already at that level it even guaranteed to be the level of Lebron. And statistically there were plenty of seasons where Matt Ryan was a top 5 quarterback so my point is showing that just because a player is good and we all know he’s good it doesn’t mean he will be a sport icon to the level that someone who matches the city so well like Vick was/is and how it’s shaping up for Trae to be
When the fuck has Matt Ryan ever been the best player in the league but I get your point just don’t think if the Hawks had a white Lebron that Quavo would be like “Nah fuck that cracka” lol
No I’m saying it as someone who has lived their whole life in Atlanta and knows how my home would react. It’s the same way how Vick is still an icon despite Matt Ryan being a clearly better player. Just because a player is good doesn’t mean they’ll capture the culture of the city
"Just look at how folks treated Matt Ryan after Vick.  It’s sad but true that a lot of fans only see skin color (whether white or black), but also culture is a big part.   I couldn’t see Doncic on the sideline cutting it up with ATL rappers. Trae has the ATL vibe, simply put."
Uh... nah.  &amp;#x200B;  Trae is a better fit for ATL as a team and fanbase. There's a reason Quavo and other ATL celebs are at games and the city is lit.   &amp;#x200B;  I hate to bring race into it but ATL needed a POC superstar to get our lazy ass fans  on board with at least one team. Doncic would have been like Matt Ryan IMO... great but perennially underrated by our own fans.

Matt Ryan must really have not wanted the Falcons rebuild
"Matt Ryan really is the most common name across sports lmao, there’s one who plays at a high level in soccer (Australia’s starting goalkeeper, played for top level clubs like Brighton, Valencia too)"
Matt Ryan is legitimately pretty damn clutch actually. Not his fault that most of the time the defense is closing out the game.
"I still believe in Wentz but to answer your question, the NFL has short seasons, players can play at an MVP level without really being elite. Recent examples:  Lamar Jackson  Matt Ryan  Cam Newton  Debatable whether any of these guys were/are truly elite, but they all have MVPs."
"Matt Ryan is the Falcons' quarterback, and 6 points is how much you get for a touchdown (without the extra point), Julio Jones is one of the best receivers in the NFL and he was traded to the Titans this year from the Falcons"
Look at Matt Ryan showing up in the 4th quarter. What a pleasant surprise!
"We had d wade last year, this year its Matt Ryan."
"Theres a reason why everyone with Hawks flair is coming in and saying “no, Absolutely not”. The Falcons are a historically bad team, many would even say a historically cursed team. The last time they made the super bowl was 98, and they have no rings. You probably can’t name a single player on that 98 team besides the kicker.   2016 brought not just team success, but dazzling team success. Matt Ryan wins MVP. Their offense is historically great. They blow out Aaron Rodgers in the NFCCG to make the super bowl.   But every Falcons fan is still in here saying that there’s NO WAY that the season was worth it. The most successful season in franchise history by far, wasn’t worth it, and they would trade it all to have just missed the playoffs again."
"but mvp means that in every sport and competition. Matt Ryan won the MVP in 2015 ffs. That means he had the most valuable season out of every player. If it only meant best players then why even play, give it to Lebron 2007-2019"
"Brady does literally everything imaginable to stave off aging, shit is a little creepy looking to me at this point tbh.  For comparison, both Rodgers and Matt Ryan also reportedly follow pretty strict diets/training regimens, but they've both cosmetically aged like normal living human beings.  So Brady is obviously some sort of weird outlier, but comparing him to Blanda is looking for the absolute polar opposite.  Here's a nice quite from Blanda on his secret to defying father time:   ""After last year people came up to me and said, 'George, how do you do it? What's your secret?  Word got out that I had a special diet, that I didn't drink or smoke. One 'insider' said that I was taking hormones, and that was why I was able to play so many games at my ripe old age. Well, there is no secret. My special diet consists of the same things I've been eating ever since I grew up: steak and potatoes and green vegetables. I smoke and I drink. The worst five years of my 21 as a pro were the five when I didn't smoke at all. Now I've gone back to cigarettes, a pack or two a day, although I don't inhale them. As for alcohol, I enjoy bourbon -- it's part of my University of Kentucky background -- but I don't guzzle it down like water. I sip it, and I limit myself to two or three drinks. You may see old George Blanda acting stupid, but you won't see him acting drunk!"""
"Yo like if Trae or Luka or both win three rings they should just Max at every chance cause I really want to see what the maximum salary will get players moving forward.  Curry didn't get Max second contract, Klay didn't get Max second contract, Dray just doesn't get Max contracts. LeBron took pay cuts with the Heat, KD took pay cuts with the Warriors and Nets. I think kyrie took less than Max with Nets I guess Russ keeps getting Max. I don't know if Harden got max second contract, Giannis didn't get Max second contract.   Matt Ryan is the only pro player who I know who got the big contract in the league each time he was up for a contract. Big rookie contract, big second contract, and big third contract. Matt Stafford took a cheaper second contract since he was always injured. Sam Bradford was always injured. And then rookie wage scale kicked in."
"Being the best for one season doesn't make you a superstar, Rich Gannon won MVP and he wasn't a superstar. Russell Wilson has never won an MVP but he's still a superstar player. The term superstar isn't a sports term in origin, which is why it is not a fully merit-based term. A superstar is someone of wide fame who is also successful. They don't necessarily have to be the best, but sometimes they are. Mike Vick is a superstar because he was an entertaining and unique player, he was always amongst the highest paid jerseys, he put the Atlanta Falcons in the spotlight, he had many many young kids wanting to be like him, and even had his own shoe. Matt Ryan just isn't that type of guy, his personality type and playstyle just isn't someone that a city like Atlanta will embrace unlike Trae Young who is a superstar in Atlanta. There were many people who were wanting to draft Matt Ryan's replacement this year"
"Superstar doesn't mean best player. A superstar is more of marking ability than it is talent (its really a combination of the two but marketing ability matters a bit more). Matt Ryan is a more talented QB than Mike Vick, but he isn't going to be seen as a superstar like Mike Vick was. There's a reason Matt Ryan is constantly disrespected despite being a good QB."
Matt Ryan literally won MVP and nearly won a championship for Atlanta.
If the Falcons had beat New England in SB51 it changes the whole public perception of Matt Ryan. What could have been. Oh well. Back to drinking myself to death.
Ok but trae is much closer to the top stars than Matt Ryan. Matt ryan has no personality and there are probably 30 players I'd take with morevstar power in the nfl
"Matt Ryan is not someone I would consider a star. Casual fans aren't drawn to him the way they are to Rodgers, brady, mahomes or jackson"
&gt;Bout time that city had a true star in a sport  Matt Ryan won NFL MVP five years ago.
the matt ryan on IT's team is not the same matt ryan as the quarterback of the falcons right
Matt Ryan just wants to go 11-5 again. That’s all he ever really wanted.
"He really wasnt. He was top 5 in 2015. That's it.   Rodgers, Brady, brees were definitely better pretty much every single year. You would have to argue that he was better than Big Ben, Matt Ryan, Matthew Stafford, Phillip Rivers, and Russell Wilson in his prime years."
That’s bs first of all he shouldn’t have been throwing the ball once Julio caught that ball they should have ran the ball freeman was averaging 9 yards per carry then even if they don’t get the first down they get a field goal and win. But they were throwing and freeman missed his blocks. Matt Ryan had a great game Kyle Shanahan on the other hand did not.
"Yeah Matt Ryan basically kept gifting us sacks off random 10-15 yard dropbacks for no reason. He literally could have nust gotten sacked at the line of scrimmage and the Falcons probably win. But he was SHOOK, it was like he felt the power and drive all swinging against him and he panicked."
Off topic but you're saying that Matt Ryan deserves to be in the HoF? That seems wild to me haha.
It's a crazy world where Rajon Rondo is a borderline hall of famer but people still doubt whether Eli Manning or Matt Ryan deserve to make the NFL Hall of Fame. The bar is just so much lower in the nba.
NBA and NFL are going through the same offensive revolution. Everyone is breaking records now. Matt Ryan could finish top 5 all time in passing yards and TDs and isn't even like a top 20 QB of all time.
Matt Ryan
Matt Ryan rn: 🥲
People are quick to forget the Falcons and Saints were the laughing stock of the NFL before Matt Ryan &amp; Drew Brees showed up. Even Vick didn’t have 2 consecutive winning seasons with the Falcons. Both franchises didn’t start winning consistently until around a decade ago.
I'm also perplexed why we haven't grabbed Matt Ryan from the charge. Dude was absolutely on fire from 3 in summer league.
"Not necessarily disagreeing, just as I think and look up some stuff: Brady and Rodgers were pretty solidly 1 and 2 then. Matt Ryan won an MVP and had his moments in 2016 and 2018. Cam Newton won his MVP but that was kind of an anomaly season. I would probably count Wilson as top 5 in that time period. And drew Brees as well probably, so yeah, I guess Big Ben would probably be 5th in some of those years, but it’s close!"
"Nah, he was still good, his team was just losing. The 2016 niners were more like the Falcons of the past couple years, doesn't mean Matt Ryan is a bad quarterback."
"Matt Ryan should go to the Broncos. Elway can fulfill his tall, white QB fetish. But un-ironically, Matt Ryan would be great for them if they don't get Rodgers this upcoming season."
Damn Matt Ryan getting scapegoated by 2 franchises now
I said given the opportunity. The Lakers do not have that opportunity with Luol.  If your names a reference to Matt Ryan #RiseUp
"""Matt Ryan sends his regards"" *stab*"
"I lived in Houston for about a decade growing up. Honestly hated their broadcast. I felt like they went over the line when being homers. Matt wasn't too bad but Bill Worrel bothered me. Not sure about these new guys, just was surprised to hear them when I watched the highlight  Also wtf is Ryan Hollins doing there? I'd be pissed if he was on our Spurs broadcast lmao"
"Yes I’m sure Ackerman was the one that he was saying was good. The other was Matt Bullard who was decent but a bit of a homer, he just recently retired with the other broadcast we had Bill Worrell. Ryan Hollins is pretty good as well if you listen to enough games of him. He’s actually a much better commentator than TV analysts"
Would not wish to have to choose between Ryan Ruocco and Matt Devlin on my worst enemy.
