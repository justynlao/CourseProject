"Yeah sorry, I still don't buy it, not that John Hollinger is gospel but here are his comments on Dwight signing with the Sixers:  ""Philadelphia lured Dwight Howard from the Lakers on a one-year minimum deal that only counts $1.6 million against their cap, even though Howard will make $2.6 million. With Howard‚Äôs BORD$ value just over $3 million, this is good business for Philly, giving them a decent option in the middle when Joel Embiid takes a load management night off. The Lakers will need to find another minimum big man to take his place.""  This means that even after having a good showing in the playoffs, his value was just slightly over the minimum, which I would guess means that he was around minimum value when he signed with the Lakers.  The difference between Rondo and Howard is that Rondo's a guard, and guard backups are just much more valuable than backup centers in today's NBA. Also, on Rondo he says:  ""Rajon Rondo‚Äôs two-year, $15 million kinda sorta shores up a position that hurt the Hawks last season, but I thought there were better options out there for Atlanta. The second year on a deal for a 34-year-old is, shall we say, suboptimal. The Hawks had several options at this price point, so lasering in on Rondo at the expense of, say, D.J. Augustin, Shabazz Napier, Elfrid Payton or Trey Burke seemed unusual. Burke, in particular, would have fit right in to the Hawks‚Äô high pick-and-roll, rinse-and-repeat scheme and he got half as much money from Dallas.""  So it's very possible that Rondo just got overpaid."
Understood. I was prepared for a response like this.   How would you defend the fact that the following players deserved it more than Goran:   * Blake Griffin * D.J. Augustin * Isaiah Thomas * DeAndre Jordan * Lance Stephenson * Anthony Davis * Gerald Green   This isn't a post about Reggie. It is about the fucked up nature of the MIP award and specifically the 2013/14 season.
"This will sound laughable, but I swear there was this moment in time around 2015 and 2016 where Stan Van Gundy's system was kind of humming in Detroit. It was the ""Form a Wall"" era, and Brandon Jennings, D.J. Augustin, and Reggie Jackson all had their own moments where they looked like point gods.   In the 15 games prior to blowing out his Achilles, Brandon Jennings was averaging 20 and 7 (including a 24-point, 21-assist performance). Then D.J. Augustin slipped into the lineup and averaged 20 and 8 until he was dealt for Reggie Jackson. Then Jackson came out and played like a borderline all-star in 2016.   During that time, you'd catch a lot of moments where you could see what Drummond could be, when he was just dining on alley-oop setups from Jennings, Augustin, and Jackson (aka, the DeAndre Jordan approach). Then again, he was still making bonehead mistakes, still playing outside himself, and as a capper, he was shooting 35 percent from the line.  His Pistons career largely consisted of easing him along, getting him reps as a means of developing and broadening his game, then finally you had Drummond deciding he was going to be whatever he wanted to be (aka 3-point shooting, playmaking Andre). He's a DeAndre who wants to be more than DeAndre."
"Because your argument is so ridiculous that the only conclusion that can be thought of is that you think human's evolved into another species in 30 years.  Like the 9th player on a NBA roster being a ""big time player"" which I assume is a least a All Star?  Like you really think that old D.J. Augustin or Wes Matthews or whoever 9th man is gonna be a All Star in the 90s?  If the league really did improve at the level you're suggesting then Kareem, Karl Malone and a bunch of other players would've never played 20 years of basketball.  The ridiculous increase in talent plus the natural decline of the human body should've made those guys out of the league by their mid 30s."
"Yeah, he was super solid as a backup PG last year. I don't think their games are super similar, but he reminds me of D.J. Augustin. He's not going to ever be thrilling, but he's going to give  you mostly the exact same thing night in and night out."
"My original assessment of who we wouldn't be able to sign was actually more optimistic than reality.  Because instead of having both the larger non-taxpayer MLE (used to sign both Forbes and Augustine) and the Bi-annual Exception (used to sign Portis), we'd only have the smaller taxpayer MLE, and no bi-annual exception.  Meaning we'd likely only end up signing someone like Augustin, considering at that point we wouldn't really have a true PG on the roster, and no playmaker/ball-handler on the bench at all.  So you'd rather have Bogdan + Augustin, instead of Donte + Portis + Forbes + Augustine?  Rolling into the season with D.J. Wilson (or someone potentially even worse on a vet min) as our primary backup big to both Giannis and Brook?  (And with even less flexibility for the future than we have right now?)  Because that's the actual choice, not just Bogdan vs. Donte.  I'd say that would be pretty terrible."
"Eh, Donte's not as good as him now (and certainly might not ever be, though he's got potential and looks like he's improving year-to-year), but that was always looking like a questionable trade given the money Bogdan was going to command.  Main reason we were so pissed at it falling through was because we thought that could end up hurting our chances of getting Giannis to re-sign (especially with the media majorly exaggerating the closeness of the Bogdan-Giannis friendship).  Bogdan's contract wouldn't have had huge implications for our immediate roster, but it would mean we probably don't sign at least one if not two of Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, or D.J. Augustin (the choice of who not to sign there seems rather obvious now, but who knows what choice the Bucks would have made, since D.J. filled a hole on the roster while Bryn was more of a bonus depth piece.)  But it also would have pushed us way more over the luxury tax than we currently are, and with us not having so many draft picks in the immediate future, not really any easy paths to improving the team at all.  I mean, we're still *kind of* in that situation, but the Bogdan contract would have definitely made us even less flexible there."
"&gt;Those 2-3 lost wins you're lamenting came as a result of Jrue Holiday missing time due to the coronavirus  ... and having to play D.J. Augustin as their only PG because of it, instead of George Hill lol"
D.J. Augustin unless he's playing the Raptors in the first round
"C.J. McCollum   J.J. Redick   J.R. Smith  A.C. Green   P.J Brown   Bench: J.J. Barea, D.J. Augustin, B.J. Armstrong, C.J. Watson, O.J. Mayo   Coach: J.B. Bickerstaff"
My NBA2k12 was glitched and every time anyone in the game scored the P.A. announcer said it was D.J. Augustin
"PG- D.J Augustin  SG- Luke Kennard  SF- Rodney Hood  PF- Rodions Kurucs  C- Justin Patton  Bench: Matthew Dellevadova, Alex Caruso, Mike Scott, TJ Leaf, Goga Bitadze"
"D.J Augustin really never dunked??? That is surprising considering how long he's been in the league. the minutes he has played, and the fact he isn't a terrible athlete and 5'11. are you sure?"

... and here we were giving Horst a lot of credit when it was really Giannis all along!  *(sweeps the D.J. Augustin signing and Torrey Craig trade under the rug)*
"Before Jordan they weren‚Äôt really relevant. After we fell into irrelevance with some playoff appearances then we became contenders with Rose and Company then fell back into irrelevancy after 2017.  The problem with the Bulls is that Rose was our whole offense and really only scorer. When he was being guarded well, we didn‚Äôt have anybody to ease/ pick up the offensive load. Hence us losing.  We would always find a replacement for Rose (Nate Robinson, D.J. Augustin, etc.) but never found that second scorer which we needed."
D.J Augustin  Patty mills
D.j Augustin
"lmao you couldn't even enjoy the championship before a month before getting all sour lmfao.  there was zero chance you would have been able to trade for jrue if you weren't seen as contenders. he picked his spot just like everyone else did.  &gt; D.J. Augustin, forward D.J. Wilson, and the Bucks first round pick in 2023  WOW THE FUCKING HOUSE"
"This is irrelevant to your comment, but I looked Pj up to see his career tenure and all the teams he‚Äôs been on. For the trade to Milwaukee P.J. was traded for D.J. Augustin and D.J. Wilson.   PJ for DJ and DJ, heh‚Ä¶üòè"
&gt;D.J. Augustin  &gt;all Bucks players
"At the start of the 2nd and 4th quarters, when you're up by 16, Avery Bradley is perfect player to come in and guard Rajon Rondo, or Lou Williams or even D.J. Augustin for 8-12 quality minutes."
"DENVER NUGGETS  PG: D.J. Augustin   SG: Andre Iguodala   SF: Carmelo Anthony   PF: Danilo Gallinari   C: Mason Plumlee  BENCH: Paul Millsap, Gary Harris, JaVale McGee, Trey Lyles, Malik Beasley, Jerami Grant"
"He's definitely not DeAndre Jordan to a tee, but he still could have performed in a similar role in some regards. In fact, during the SVG era, he kind of did, and that's arguably when he was at his most effective. Reggie Jackson/Brandon Jennings/D.J. Augustin would utilize his screens then feed him scraps at the rim - he yielded his first all-star selection off of that.   But the extra stuff just became too tantalizing over the years."
