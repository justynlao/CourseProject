"Brad Stevens has a reputation for making role players look really, really good. Evan Turner, Terry Rozier, Marcus Morris, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, the list goes on and on. His squads also have everyone buy in to the team identity and play hard-nosed defense, while getting everyone involved on offense.  He's a defense-minded coach, which is why the defensive schemes are significantly more complicated than the offense. He's already coached plenty of good offenses so far, of course he has room to improve at that end."
"It's not the same without Smart, IT, Avery Bradley, David West, Klay and Mo Speights"
Avery Bradley 🤨
"&gt;""Don't ever say anything bad (no matter how true) about the Heat or you will face a lot of backlash""   &gt;   &gt; ""Still don't understand why Miami had massive expectations"" ""They massively overachieved last year. They'll still make the playoffs, but that roster is a first round exit.""   &gt;   &gt;""Massively overachieving in a bubble playoffs in your home state, making no improvements to the roster, and watching the rest of the top of the East improve is not a recipe for success""   &gt;   &gt;Butler has been a BAD 3pt shooter for years, but nobody is ever willing to say anything negative about him. Why is that changing now?   &gt;   &gt;Adding KD to Brooklyn wasn't a guaranteed improvement? Bucks obviously improved Anybody who understands basketball knew that Philly would be improved. Heat were always a distant 5th coming into the season. Probably 6th if Indy ever gets healthy.    &gt;   &gt;You did not just say that Avery Bradley is a wash for Jae Crowder in 2021 🤦‍♂️Along with a bunch of other nonsense 😂   &gt;   &gt;Jimmy Butler was a 24% 3pt shooter last year fyi   &gt;   &gt;He was Philly's third best player and had to hide on defense after Kawhi ruined him the first half of game 1.   &gt;   &gt;People really need to stop pretending that the bubble was a good indication of the future 🤦‍♂️And your last paragraph is hilarious how dumb it is 😂   &gt;   &gt;Your team got hot and never had an actual chance to win a championship. Better hope your front office wises up and tries to make moves instead of pretending guys like Robinson and Herro are future stars   &gt;   &gt;So when are you going to get an actual #1 star who can win a championship? And congrats on having the 3rd/4th best center in the East. That'll get you far.   &gt;   &gt;He shot 24% from 3 last year 😂  All from the last 4 hours btw 😂😂😂😂😂 I like how salty you are that Butler dipped to go to a team that will always be better than the sixers   can't wait to see what the next genius move the poverty sixers will make after drafting fultz first overall over Tatum and then maxing al horford 😭😭😭"
"&gt;You did not just say that Avery Bradley is a wash for Jae Crowder in 2021  You seemingly overrate Crowder by a large margin.  Last year in the playoffs, the Heat were a net negative of -2.4 pts/100 with Crowder on the floor, and were 11.8/100 better **without** him.  The Suns this year are also 5.5 pts/100 worse when Crowder plays, than without him.  So far this year, the Heat are 7 pts/100 better with Bradley, then they are without him.  Last year, Bradley was also a net positive on the champion Lakers during the regular season, to the tune of +2.8 pts/100 better with him.  So yeah, at best for Crowder, they are a wash.  If you want to get precise, the evidence indicates that Bradley is actually an upgrade."
You did not just say that Avery Bradley is a wash for Jae Crowder in 2021 🤦‍♂️  Along with a bunch of other nonsense 😂
"&gt;Adding KD to Brooklyn wasn't a guaranteed improvement?  Not at 32 years old, coming off a ruptured Achilles.  The list of 6'10"" guys who have played great at that age, post-Achilles, is very short.  &gt; Bucks obviously improved   You should tell their win-loss record that.  &gt; Anybody who understands basketball knew that Philly would be improved   I thought they'd be better... and yet, they apparently desired to blow it all up and trade for Harden.  &gt; Heat were always a distant 5th coming into the season.   Nonsense.  And, for the record, they picked up Avery Bradley who is basically a wash for Crowder, although at a different position.  And with Herro and Adebayo being just 21 and 23 respectively, and only Dragic and Igoudala north of 31, expecting Miami to be at-least as good as they were last year was not unreasonable."
Tyler Herro benched for Avery Bradley??
"it’s COVID but it’s also giannis related.  mind you we didn’t resign Jae Crowder or DJJ because we were clearing space up for Giannis; and when he didn’t sign here, we replaced them with Avery Bradley and Moe Harkless. arguably our defensive spark plug and one of our premier young talents replaced by a journeyman and (admittedly) a pretty good defender  i feel like we’ve instantly suffered as a result a lil. i miss DJJ."
"Goran and Avery Bradley, namely. Meyers &amp; Moe are out too, but they’re not nearly as rotational."
"Fuck yeah those games were rough too, I just remember Avery Bradley randomly becoming a god around that time lol"
"How about bigger, longer Avery Bradley?"
The TS% of the guy who takes the 3rd most shots on the team is extremely important.  Lying down on the court in the middle of play multiple times in the same game is ridiculous and indicative of a wider approach.  If the Lakers just wanted a guard to play defense we could have kept Avery Bradley.
r/nba geniuses and pretending scoring efficiency is not the most important thing for a guy who takes the third most shots on the team and was brought in to score efficiently.  If the Lakers just wanted a defensive guard they could have kept Avery Bradley.
"Other than Butler, the Heat were also missing Goran, Avery Bradley, and Iguodala tonight. It’s been a revolving door of who’s in and out the last few weeks, and tonight was no exception."
"Tomas Satoransky   (Healthy) Otto Porter   Avery Bradley   Steven Adams  Jae Crowder   Sato and Otto are generally productive, though they haven't consistently been part of winning teams. That could change this season though, depending on how the Bulls play throughout the season.  Bradley, Adams, and Crowder have each played as starters on good teams. Maybe not as productive this season, but definitely last season and previous ones too."
"Injury Report before anyone asks ""Why are the Heat 6-12?"" tomorrow:  \- Jimmy Butler, Goran Dragic, Avery Bradley, Andre Iguodala, Meyers Leonard, Maurice Harkless, Chris Silva all OUT"
It's safe to speculate Jimmy and Avery Bradley tested positive. They were the only ones who weren't cleared until Monday and Avery has already gone ahead and said he tested positive.
All Ik forsure is that 2019-2020 Lakers would have the best defense of all time   - PG- Prime Rondo - SG- Prime Danny Green - SF- Prime Bron - PF- AD - C- Prime Dwight   Sixth man- Prime Avery Bradley
"It was relevant because you made it with your bad information about no one being in protocol until 1/12 on the Wizards.  I was aware that's not true, so I said something.  As for what the other implication, it's proof that the day before your team played a team that had players with covid on it.  Jason Taytum absolutely tested positive.  Seth Curry also got covid after playing your team. You're a fan of contact tracing, you do the math.  Neither Avery Bradley or Seth Curry are known for going out and partying.  No one is blaming the Wizards, but you can't prove they didn't give it to the Heat."
"&gt;Buying him out means he leaves a lot of that money on the table  Not really. By the deadline, Cavs have covered half his salary in the end. It's not like he's paid the full amount as a lump sum at teh end of the year - it's spread out throughout the season, so halfway through he's only owed ~14m left.  The Nets have a 5.7M DPE. Drummond could give back 5.7m of the ~14m and then the Nets cover that with their exception meaning  Drummond isn't leaving money on the table AND the Cavs save 5.7m at the same time.  This is entirely reasonable. Avery Bradley didn't leave money on the table because the Lakers paid him with the MLE what he was losing from his buyout with the Grizzlies last year."
And Avery Bradley
And avery bradley
"The West has lost quite a few stars to the East, namely Harden, Westbrook, KD etc. The Lakers lost Dwight, Avery Bradley and such to the East as well. I think that the West has lost some appeal, making the competition less fierce. The Jazz seemed to have a slump but have recovered from it. Most teams though are just hanging there.  It's fair to say that the Clippers are one of the top teams. They seemed to be an underdog with the Lakers supposedly becoming even better than last season. Now the Lakers are looking more downbeat and the Clippers are shooting up the ladder."
"We have most of the guys back from H&amp;S protocols except for Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley, who are pretty important for our perimeter defense (and well, *Jimmy freaking Butler*).   Also Tyler Herro has missed the last few games with neck spasms, which has hurt as well"
I keep hearing jimmy and and Avery Bradley are coming back for the second game vs nets. That game will be fun.
Most sport personalities are. Never forget when Chris Broussard didn’t put Avery Bradley on his all defense team Bc “booker dropped 70 on him” but Bradley didn’t play that game.
"Bro, Avery Bradley and Jimmy are out with COVID, not for half/the whole season 💀"
In 2019: my Avery Bradley
"Precious has played 17 mpg this year, he’s not moving the needle for the heat in the playoffs. Avery bradley is a good defensive guard but crowder has more size. They also lost derrick jones, another good defender with crazy wingspan."
"They lose Jae and kept everybody else while adding Precious and Avery Bradley. How exactly did they get worse? If you're that high on Jae I guess but even then, not hard to make playoffs in the East at all."
"Miami has Bam for KD, Jimmy for James, and Avery Bradley for Kyrie."
"Not really he has made good picks such as al Jefferson, Tony Allen, Gerald green, rondo, Avery Bradley, Kelly olynky terry rozier, smart brown and Tatum. All of those players have contributed to either a championship team or multiple deep playoff runs. You’re not going to hit every draft pick and have them be a long tenure vet, but for the most part he has done a solid job at finding talent. Yes he has very questionable draft picks in the past but I would still trust him over almost any gm in league besides the raptors and maybe the warriors"
"The good: Bam and Herro are improved, now have Avery Bradley to defend guards, got a nice backup big man in Precious  The bad: injuries and COVID, turnovers, inconsistent power forward production, inconsistent defence, Nunn &amp; Leonard still struggling for the most part"
"RoCo is narrative player rn lol. just because he's that good 3 yrs ago, doesnt mean he's still that good. I also got baited for want him last offeseason. passing the torch from Avery Bradley"
"Depends on my role. If I was a key guy on a championship team, then I would prefer that.  I would, however, rather be an Mvp than have an Avery Bradley or even Jared dudley chip."
"We’re not getting Danny Green, KCP, Avery Bradley etc if we get Kawhi. Still better off with him but it’s not the exact same team"
Exactly.  This sub forgets how quickly they were saying guys like KCP were overpaid and Avery Bradley should be out of the league because he's been so bad
id probably throw Nunn and Avery Bradley on that list
"What's the difference between these two lists?  1. Russell Westbrook, Cory Joseph, Dorian Finney-Smith, Derrick White, Mikal Bridges, Gary Harris, Jrue Holiday, Terrance Ferguson, Royce O’Neale, Shabazz Napier. 2. Jrue Holiday, Cory Joseph, Aaron Gordon, Derrick White, Avery Bradley, Mikal Bridges, Kent Bazemore, Gary Harris, Josh Okogie, Trevor Ariza."
"&gt; you keep signing $5M players for $1-3M.   Who exactly are you referring to? I feel like you're really misremembering what the Lakers' circumstances were before last season if you think they just attracted a bunch of ring chasers for cheap. Keep in mind the Lakers had a max cap slot for Kawhi, and when he went to the Clippers the Lakers were left with all that cap space (~$32 million) to sign players. Danny Green didn't come to the Lakers for a discount, he came cause they gave him a 2 year $30 million deal. KCP re-signed with the Lakers because they gave him a 2 year $17 million deal. It even took offering Javale McGee a 2 year $8.2 million deal to get him to re-sign. Kuzma was on his rookie deal still and they signed Caruso coming off of his 2-way contract.   Other than that the Lakers signed Dwight and Rondo to minimum deals because that was the most *anyone* was willing to offer them. A lot of people thought they shouldn't even be in the league anymore. Dwight had been traded to the Grizzlies on a $5 million deal and they bought him out cause they didn't want him, and there weren't any reports of Rondo being offered *anything* that summer other than the minimum the Lakers gave him. The Lakers signed Avery Bradley to a 2 year $10 million after he too had been bought out by the Grizzlies and most people thought that was an overpay.   *This* year the Lakers probably got some ring chasers for cheap (Gasol, Trez and Matthews), but that wasn't the case last season. Next summer Brooklyn isn't going to have $30+ million in cap space, they'll just have the taxpayer MLE ($5 million) and vet mins to offer. And this season of course there aren't any vets available as they're all already signed. But next summer the Nets could sign a guy or two for cheap, but of course they'll be competing with the Lakers and everyone else for those guys."
"Javale McGee got 4M and was seen as a minimum contract player  Dwight got a minimum and was only signed late in the offseason because Boogie got hurt, he literally wouldn't have gotten signed if the Lakers didn't sign him  Rondo signed for the minimum because he was seen as a terrible ball hog  Avery bradley signed for 5M and was waived by the Grizzlies, no team had cap space left by the time the Lakers signed him so 5M was the most he was gonna get  KCP re-signed with the Lakers after being there 2 years prior  Caruso signed for 3M and hadn't played regular NBA rotation minutes yet  Danny Green got 15M  Nobody was going to offer any of those guys more than what we offered. Only this year with Wesley Matthews, Montrezl Harrell, and Marc Gasol have we gotten ring chasers, and none of those caliber players are going to hit the buyout market."
"Yeah, if the OP is talking about who Brooklyn could get this summer then that's one thing, but they aren't gonna find any ring chasing vets this season cause those guys are already all signed to teams. Also, for people thinking the Lakers just used the allure of LeBron and AD to sign a bunch of ring chasing vets for cheap, that's wrong too.   Once Kawhi turned the Lakers down they had over $30 million in cap space they'd earmarked for Kawhi that they then used to sign players with. Danny Green came to the Lakers cause they gave him $14 million, not cause he was ring chasing. KCP came back to the Lakers cause they gave him $9 million. They got a couple guys on the minimum (Rondo and Dwight) that nobody thought were worth anything, and who a lot of people thought maybe shouldn't even be in the league anymore. They were not guys who turned down larger offers elsewhere to sign with the Lakers. The Lakers used the BAE on Avery Bradley and most people thought that was an overpay.   Next summer Brooklyn is gonna have the taxpayer MLE (about $5 million) and vet minimums to offer. They might get some guys with those, but teams like the Lakers will have the same things to offer as well."
"The only good-value ring chaser Lakers had last season was Dwight on a minimum last season and Markieef Morris after his buyout.   Caruso was on the team for a while already so he doesn't count, Danny Green was definitely paid above market value, Avery Bradley was pretty washed up the prior season, Rondo looked horrid in the regular season, Cousins didn't even play a game.   The thing now is, who is available in the trade/buyout/free agent market suits the Nets' needs?"
"2011 Celtics with Shaq, KG, PP, Allen, Rondo + a second unit of Jermaine O'Neal, Troy Murphy, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley, and Nate Robinson. That is an absolutely stupid starting five with a crazy second unit."
Why don't you mention the Lakers missing Avery Bradley?
" &gt;Turner and a free agent for 11 mill does not have even half of the impact of Gobert, the Jazz’s best player.    11M gets you Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard or Derrick Favors or Serge Ibaka 🤷🏾‍♂️"
They would put Avery Bradley on Kyrie. That's probably as good as one on one defenders that you could put on those three. Miami's strength is their team defense tho so it would probably be the coaching and schemes that would give the Nets the most trouble. I still believe the Nets will cruise through the East tho.
"Avery Bradley, Seth Curry, Robert Covington, Jae Crowder, Shaq"
dude half of the Heat roster out. Not even like Avery Bradley is playing lmao. not a good look talking shit
"I think it’s partially true what you are saying, that being said context for an athlete type of Lebron James matters. If he opts out, he loses on fortunes of dollars, his reputation makes a huge hit, he gets a ton of hate and criticism, and he will be judged accordingly. Those factors would not be in play for you and me, even guys like Avery Bradley because those athletes simply are not as impactful and talked about as much"
If you don’t think Miami could win a title with that roster then you are just wasting your time with the current roster because the current roster is nowhere near the title threat that roster would be   The depth concerns are foolish Bam/Butler/Harden/Dragic/Avery bradley/Harkless/Iguodala and someone you can get from the buyout market which would be possible for Miami if they did this trade is plenty when your big 3 is bam Butler and harden. Again this is a 2 for 1 swap basically guys like kelly olynyk and Kendrick Nunn don’t move the needle at all vs the top competition. It’s not actually hurting playoff depth a whole lot and all the “spacing” concerns don’t matter nearly as much when you have generational talent like James harden that’s why you acquire generational talent in the first place. He himself demands double and even triple teams
Please no we’re so scarce on solid bigs already. I’m cool w one of kelly or precious going not both and maybe throw in Avery Bradley or Kendrick nunn
"The same Roster turnover always happens.   Look at the Celtics team with Brad Stevens.    Marcus Smart is the only player left that played in those first 2 Playoff Series under Brad Stevens. Jaylen Brown came in during the 3rd Year of the Celtics making the Playoffs and Tatum after that.   Celtics got rid of Isiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynik, Etc.   Even later on they lost Kyrie, Rozier, Morris, and Horford."
Why don't you mention the Lakers not having one of their starters (Avery Bradley) at all because of the bubble? Or how Ad got injured in the finals too? Or how dominant the Lakers were in the rest of the playoffs?
"&gt; That's just not a true statement whatsoever.  Celtics had literally nothing when they blew up the Big 3. They even dumped Rondo.  Avery Bradley and Jared Sullinger were their two shining young prospects at the time.  Houston already has more than that.  To be clear you think that one example from a decade ago disproves my statement that most teams like to go in with a sure thing? You ignore more recent and relevant trades like AD to LA? Or PG to LA? Those teams traded guys who should have equal or less value than harden, got young studs + fuck tons of picks.   &gt; Absurdly likely.  All 3 guys can opt out, but even if they don't... Kyrie already seems to have one foot out of the league, and in 2024 Durant is 36 and Harden 35.  Players peaks don't last as long as Lebron - he's an extreme exception.  The Nets have a good two year run if all goes well, but after that, it gets dicey quick.  If you think it’s absurdly likely that just tells me you haven’t paid attention to the nets over the last few years. You realize that the current gm took over the franchise with no players, no picks, and turned them into a playoff team within 2 years?"
"&gt; Ya most teams going into a full rebuild like to have a couple sure thing assets to serve as a foundation for the rebuild.   That's just not a true statement whatsoever.  Celtics had literally nothing when they blew up the Big 3. They even dumped Rondo.  Avery Bradley and Jared Sullinger were their two shining young prospects at the time.  Houston already has more than that.  &gt; 1) nets completely crater to the worst team in the league over 2024-2027.  Absurdly likely.  All 3 guys can opt out, but even if they don't... Kyrie already seems to have one foot out of the league, and in 2024 Durant is 36 and Harden 35.  Players peaks don't last as long as Lebron - he's an extreme exception.  The Nets have a good two year run if all goes well, but after that, it gets dicey quick.  &gt; 2) the rockets get lotto luck and end up with multiple top 3 picks over this time. &gt; 3) the rockets draft atleast 2 absolute studs with those top 3 picks. &gt; 4) the rockets develop those studs into stars.  With 4 extra 1sts plus all the swaps plus their own... Pretty damn good chance they end up with a couple of winners in the next few years, if not top 3.  With 12 firsts over 8 years, most of which should be no worse than low lottery... yeah, they're going to get some good players."
"So we're calling Avery Bradley a ""significant upgrade"" now? Same with Tristan Thompson?"
"Nah they voted him All-D second team, and that person never got to vote again. The dumbest one in recent memory was Broussard not voting Avery Bradley All-D because Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics in a game Bradley didn’t play. Or that one guy from New York who literally just voted based on rebounds and blocks (Whiteside, Drummond etc)."
"I saw Avery Bradley shoot 48% from 3 through a 15 game stretch last year with fans lol, I think the no fans is getting a bit overstated"
Lakers roster as a whole was underrated as hell. All the role players worked so well with each other and complimented the big 2 so well. Avery Bradley didn't even play In the playoffs.
"Kleber &amp; Avery Bradley too , &amp; more of course"
"So, I like to call it the Avery Bradley effect where great individual defense doesn't necessarily translate to great defensive impact. He can be playing really good man defense but there's still other areas which can be improved on a lot and those areas outweigh the individual defensive impact. I just wanted to focus primarily on his effort on the defensive end."
"Look at u. Avery Bradley was on a championship team about to get a ring and decided to not even go to the bubble and instead to be with his child. George Hill's been complaining about the league from the summer! Again, if he really doesnt wanna be there, that's all on him. He's not some poor Walmart employee. He does alot of yapping as if he doesnt have the ability to do it.  People like George Hill rather see every1 not play than they sitting out."
Avery Bradley was the best at pressing  a ball handler full court
"If it makes you feel better, when we play you tomorrow we are gonna be without Bam, Jimmy, Goran, Avery Bradley, Kendrick Nunn, KZ Okpala, Mo Harkless, and Haslem.  Battle of the decimated.  Our game on thursday with y’all is on TNT 😂😂😂😂"
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
Hey Duncan! Can I ask about your thoughts on Avery Bradley and how much of an impact he has had on your team so far? Always loved watching him play ever since he was in the Celts
I thought Miami was missing Avery Bradley and thats it. Tf?
Former Shaq teammates still in league.  Lebron James - Lakers Avery Bradley - Heat Rajon Rondo - Hawks Danny Green - 76ers Robin Lopez - Wizards
"Avery's reasoning behind sitting out of the NBA 2020 Bubble was because he was fearful of contracting the virus and spreading it to a compromised family member.  During the July 16 wildcat strike, however, Avery led a players coalition, saying ""we solve the real issues by using our platforms... We don't need to say more... Protesting during an anthem, wearing T-shirts is great, but we need to see real actions being put in to the works.""  It is WIDELY speculated that Bradley REALLY sat out of the 2020 Bubble and Lakers title run because he was upset about the players conceding, when he desired pressuring the league through a continued strike.  This is probably a confirmed reality given he had no problem playing outside of the bubble in 2021 and possible contraction of the virus.  Full circle with this guy."
"The Lakers' trade for AD was far more frontloaded than the Clippers' trade for PG. All the Lakers still owe for that trade is two 1st round picks and a pick swap that it doesn't look like will ever be used. The Clippers, on the other hand, [still owe most of this shit.](https://i.redd.it/gablumavxti51.jpg)  But in any event, the Lakers' bench last year was far from ""trash"" as they didn't make any meaningful trades to upgrade it, and instead just added Markieff Morris on the buyout market. Last year's Laker bench had KCP, Caruso, Rondo, Kuzma, and Dwight Howard on it to start the year. Eventually KCP moved into the starting lineup when Avery Bradley didn't go to the bubble, and the Lakers picked up Kieff."
"He’s intensity on the defensive end is amazing and offensively has been lights out from 3 this year so far while being able to create his own shot if needed and create for others. Whether he starts or comes off the bench he will play insane amounts of minutes  This might be a hot take but as a heat fan, I think at the end of the year I think we look back and prefer Avery Bradley to jae crowder despite jae crowder playing incredibly well for us"
And Avery Bradley. He isn't the replacement for Jae. But from what I understand they wouldn't have been able to pay him if they paid Jae
How has Avery Bradley been?
Surprising: Avery Bradley. He’s been absolutely fantastic  Disappointing: Duncan. I don’t know what the fucks going on but he’s been wildly inconsistent and I swear his defense somehow got even worse
Last two 1st rd point guards: Terry Rozier (16th) and Rondo (21st) and only other small guard being Avery Bradley (18th) who's an undersized SG...    If you mean Carsen Edwards and Waters...  they're in their 2nd season and second round picks w/ Waters 51st. Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird were 53rd and 56th picks. So yeah late 2nd round guards (or any position) very rarely translate--for any team. Meanwhile Ainge actually has a very good return on the two or three mid/late 1st rd 6'2 and under PG guards he's drafted.
Antione Carr Avery Bradley
"Damn, I didn’t realize Avery Bradley was 192 years old."
avery bradley is the only debatable thing on this list. but otherwise your list is perfect. great work!
Jimmy/Bam/Dragic/Herro/DRobb/Precious/idk pick one from Iggy/Avery Bradley/KZ/Kelly O
They used to be 7/11 until Avery Bradley left and Tatum went back to #0
They are fucking around but it's to protect Ad from injury and be smart. Only when they are forced to do they play their best lineup. Even in the Houston series they kept starting Javale.  Yes Avery Bradley. You're crying about Goran Dragic as if he would have made a difference lmao
"avery bradley? avery bradley? avery fucking bradley?  LaKeRs BeSt LiNeUp... AD dont wanna play no 5. you acting like the lakers are fucking around. no, ad just a bitch"
"By that logic the Lakers were undermanned without a starter in last year's playoffs (Avery Bradley).  Fact is, the Lakers only started their best lineup one time last year and it was Game 6 of the Finals with Ad at the 5 and Caruso in the starting lineup. 99% of the time the Lakers dick around and try to win with other lineups and are *still* the best in the league.  Kyrie and KD would choke like they always do."
CJ and Lou on offense.    Avery Bradley on Defense.
"There’s so many reliable guards ahead of him this year (Herro, Dragic and now Avery Bradley) that it’s not crazy to think he just has been pushed out of the rotation by virtue of being the 4th best option at his position."
"Too much guard depth, can't run heavy minutes for Robinson,Herro both kinda sieves and then have Avery bradley/Goran who are both plus players lose minutes to Nunn."
When did Avery Bradley become a point guard. Might as well say KCP is one as well.
"Avery Bradley in the regular season, when healthy.   Of course, AB doesn't do playmaking"
"Doubt it, avery bradley is the one who should be upset by it"
"I agree that the jury is still out for Wiggins and I would hope the warriors environment would help, but Sikkim and wood were also a large part of opportunity. Wiggins as a no one pick was afforded more minutes, touches, shots, etc where as woods and Sia once they got trust and rope from their team just kept taking off where Wiggins shows flashes, seems sincere, but can disappear easily too. In offense that can happen when playing with talent, but on defense if he had Kelly oubres energy,p he could make a killing. It’s like Avery Bradley. Was coming to ut as a top high school over so. Type of scorer. Didn’t succeed too much there but just used his athleticism talent and committed to defense, austin rivers was similar. Wiggins could or I wish he would at least do that consistent, got all the tools ans has averaged over 20. He’s got the talent."
last one gotta be Avery Bradley or Aaron Baynes
People used to call avery bradley AB and I didn’t know shit also MPJ didn’t know who that motherfucker was.
MS = ?  PP = Paul Piece  AN = ?  OA = OG Anunoby  AB = Avery Bradley
"Statistically you are wrong, you can compare the stats, statistically the Lakers was deeper and had more contribuitors than the 2016 Warriors, and you are forgetting Markieff Morris who is really solid, Avery Bradley was starting on any other theam he started avery game for the Clippers the year prior, Mcgee was starting in the Warriors one year prior to go the Lakers.  So i think your bias is running higher than logic and data."
"So Howard, Rondo, Mcgee, Danny Green, Kuzma, Avery Bradley, Jr Smith, Dion Waiters, Markief Morris are not better and deeper than Barnes, Draymong, Iggy, Shaun, Bogut, Clark, Barbosa, Ezeli, Varejao?"
Avery Bradley
"Avery Bradley hitting deep 2s off the dribble, the 3ball finally falling for the Heat while our shooters bricked wide open shots is what made it close.   Granted I'd like to see us improve against the full court press."
"He got benched for Avery Bradley in the 4th, so not great."
But how better is Avery Bradley Beal?
I mean does he mean avery bradley at his best and Beal specifically in tha 2018 season?
[2010-2011 Celtics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2011.html)  Rondo/Nate Robinson/Carlos Arroyo  Ray Allen/Avery Bradley/Delonte West  Paul Pierce/Jeff Green/Marquis Daniels  Kevin Garnett/Glen Davis/Nenad Krstic  Shaq/Jermaine O'Neal/Kendrick Perkins
Avery bradley
Where are Kendrick Nunn and Avery Bradley now? Hmmm. Where’s Jabari Bird?
"Detroit Pistons guard Avery Bradley reportedly reached a settlement with a woman who alleged he sexually assaulted her in May, according to TMZ Sports."
Damn I’m actually surprised because I remember bos/wsh playoff series I felt like so many players like Avery Bradley and Marcus smart cutting to the rim because Wall wouldn’t guard that to save his life
"Biased take... Rob Pelinka? Kinda obvious if you think about it.   Lost McGee, Dwight, Rondo, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green.   Gained Trez, Gasol, Schröder, Wesley Matthews  Drafted Talen Horton Tucker who has broken out for us   Recently signed Damian Jones who has been doing really well"
 1. spolestra talked about it last year but he clearly emphasized having at least 2 legit floor spacers at all times around Butler and bam with 2 of dragic herro and Robinson. Floor spacing for how they run their offense and motion was crucial. The plan tbh this year was fo have Avery Bradley at the  3 with Butler at the 4 to close some games tbh if everybody was healthy  2. Oladipo regardless of his %s isn’t a floor spacer nobody guards him and he is dependent on having the ball in his hands   3. The problem with Oladipo is you have to ask what does he do well right now? Needs the ball in his hands but he’s inefficient not a high level playmaker not great off ball and doesn’t play defense like he used so. He’s not good enough to play the way he wants to and he’s not good enough to justify playing through him over Butler or Bam   His 2018 season came off finishing at an outlier level at the rim which post injury in skeptical he can sustain again. His upside and fit isn’t worth it for Miami
"He meant he wasn't a top 10 in the current NBA, he gave a list but I cant remember who he had above Harden, I think it was something like DWade, Demar, Klay, Booker, Butler, Avery Bradley, then I think he put CJ, Beal, Gary Harris, and Andre Roberson but I'm not sure"
We are also missing Avery Bradley. Man I can’t wait for a healthy Heat team.
This isn't even our final form  Still missing Tyler Herro and Avery Bradley
"Nothing confusing, all you're seeing is this team slowly getting its roster back. We're now up to missing only 2 starter-caliber players (Herro and Avery Bradley) and two bench players (a 5 and a 3)."
Also still missing Avery Bradley which was looking pretty good in some games
"Avery Bradley means no Vincent, that’s a big factor"
All?  Still missing Herro and Avery Bradley has been out for over a month. We had 2 G-Leaguers on the floor tonight. This wasn't even our final form
"""healthy""  Tyler Herro, Avery Bradley, and Myers Leonard would like to object."
"We told everyone. No one listened.   We're _still_ not healthy. We're missing Herro, and Avery Bradley has been out for like 5 weeks.   But nah, the Heat were a fluke."
Or Avery Bradley.
Mitchell being comped as another Avery Bradley just goes to show how shoddy prospect scouting can be  He's like.. the exact opposite of an Avery Bradley. Except their both undersized guards
"Heat/Rockets trade idea:  Heat get: Victor Oladipo, PJ Tucker, Roddy Kurucs  Rockets get: Olynyk, Leonard, Precious, Avery Bradley  Heat have limited upside to improve their roster and I think one of the only ways they can make something happen is taking a gamble on Victor Oladipo (who has made it apparent that he wants to be in Miami).  So the Heat leverage that desire to get him for pennies on the dollar essentially - Olynyk is an expiring and Leonard has a team option for next season. On top of that, the Heat look to boost their depth at the 4 with PJ and taking another gamble on Roddy Kurucs.  Precious is the true asset that the Rockets get back. This trade may gut the center depth on the Heat too much and they may look to replace Precious with someone like Kendrick Nunn but I figured he has less value as a RFA. Thoughts?"
Ey story of our season. There will be more records broke on our 3 point defense if moves aren't made  Having Avery Bradley back would help though
Avery Bradley punching the air rn
"Your take is ridiculous when you look at his coaching history.   He coached a starting lineup of Rookie Smart, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller to 40 wins.   The next year was IT, AB Crowder, Sullinger and Amir. Three of those guys aren't even in the NBA anymore. That team won 48 games.   They won 53 and the ECF the next season by replacing Sullinger with Horford.   Then they went to the conference finals with Rookie Tatum, 2nd year Brown, Scary Terry, Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart. And they were minutes from the finals. They went through Giannis/Middleton and Embiid/Simmons."
Just wait until we are playing Herro or Avery Bradley rather than Gabe fuckin Vincent
Avery Bradley is just a construct of our collective imaginations
"I think I actually agree with this.   Brad peaked when he had that Horford, IT, Crowder, Evan Turner, Avery Bradley, Amir Johnson crew. True unselfishness and no real ""star"" besides IT and they could play his system of wings and bigs where everyone passes and is you keep moving the ball until you get a great shot.   But man, he doesn't know how to work a stars strength into the system he runs. it's either ""everyone better be able to pass"" or ""you, superstar, go iso and take the shot""  We have a roster where neither of those two things work because we don't have kyrie anymore and we don't have passing bigs or a true playamking point guard.   Obviously I think some of it is the roster but this team has more talent that what we're seeing and it's def Brad's fault.   What's pissing me off is the organization is pointing fingers at the players and everyone is defending brad and Ainge.   Honestly, I've watched too many Celtics games to blame the players this time around. Its just not working and blaming a 24 and 22 year old all star for ISOing when their teammates are Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson is fucking embrassing and it's going to run both of the Jays out of town.   Ainge has this off season to really get this roster fixed or we''re legit fucked lol"
"The consistent messaging that I get here is that players would prefer a coach that they can relate to. It's a pretty simply message that has value, and I'm glad KAT shared, but in no way is he calling the hiring process systematically racist. If anything it's a message to front offices around the league to better cater the hiring of coaches to the team's preferences.   Similarly, players like Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, and Kyrie Irving have expressed that they'd like to see more black people hired as coaches or front office execs. The thing is, they aren't saying that systematic racism is the problem here. They're just expressing their preferences. I can't find anyone/any article explicitly or even implicitly calling out the hiring process as systemically racist.   And to your final point, I don't disagree with the blanket statement of - ""since systemic racism plays a role in some hiring/admission processes, it's possible that it plays a similar role in the NBA coaching sphere"". But let's say hypothetically that the pool of coaching candidates is exclusively NBA retirees. What type of race-based advantage does a white NBA retiree have over their black colleague? The only thing I could point to would be the constant branding of white players as ""intellectual, good shooters, hard working, team players"". That might give them an advantage, but is that systemic racism? I have no clue, maybe it's warranted, maybe it isn't.   My issue is - when will people stop asking if the NBA coach hiring process is racist? What does the endgame look like? Is it when players feel comfortable enough with the diversity in the coaching role? Because that might create a negative racial bias against white players applying.   Bit of a rant, but I'll close with this. I think everyones goal for a hiring process is a merit based system where everyone comes from equal opportunity. My worry is that the NBA looks at what players like KAT are saying, and they overcorrect their hiring to match the player's preferences. NBA players feeling appropriately represented shouldn't be the only input in the coaches hiring process, and it certainly shouldn't be used as proof of an un-racist system. Probably could have said this more succinctly, but it is what is it. Happy to hear anyones thoughts on it though."
He once tried to trade an aging Ray Allen who was being outplayed by Avery Bradley?
"Tony Allen, Al Jefferson, PP, Avery Bradley, Gerald Green, Delonte West, Marcus Smart"
"I wrote a 3 page article for a sports journalism class in college in I believe 2017 about how the Celtics absolutely cannot afford to lose Avery Bradley... he went to Detroit and has bounced around a few disappointing stops since, while the Celtics made multiple ecf’s, and jaylen brown is objectively 10x better at that role in stevens system than Bradley ever could be."
Avery Bradley? Cmon bro no ones missing Avery Bradley. Nowhere near smart or holiday
"You were still winning games last season when AD was out right? You really missed DG, Dwight and Avery Bradley for regular season."
So basically Avery Bradley or Reggie Evans?
Avery Bradley on Kyrie Lu Dort on harden Shane battier on kd Bruce Bowen on Harris Giannis on Jeff green
As long as two of Herro Duncan Strus Olynyk Nunn Dragic are on the floor our defense will suffer  And if 3 of Bam Jimmy Iguodala Precious are on the floor the offense will suffer  It's hard to develop a proper rotation with that many liabilities   Our only guy who can shoot and defend is Avery Bradley and he's injured lololol Crowder was our other 3&amp;D but of course he's gone
"Avery Bradley is not a good three-point shooter, he has traditionally been a poor three-point shooter. He had a little bit of a hot streak before the postponement of the season, but otherwise he's not a shooter.   Beyond that, Bradley was not with the team during the bubble.  Green I'll give to you. They've missed him, but I think they've missed his size on defense more than his offense.  But yes, I do believe the team definitely has better shooters and spacing this year. The Lakers' spacing was awful anytime they played two bigs, especially if Rondo was also on the floor. Teams would cheat off of Rondo and McGee/Dwight."
"Probably not the best player, but give me Avery Bradley."
"Eh the Heat were missing Avery Bradley, goran dragic and Tyler herro (injured after 13 minutes)"
"Why do you think so? You basically upgraded from Rondo to Shruder. Kuz is better than last year, THT is better, the rest of the roster is literally the same except you have Gasol instead of Dwight (Javale and Avery Bradley didn't play in the playoffs)"
damn this thing is like the woman beater superbowl. in the past we have  legends like lance stephenson and demarcus cousins and now carrying their torch is  avery bradley and kendrick nunn
Lakers are racking up a nice little roster of people who like to abuse women huh. first avery bradley and lance stephenson and now boogies coming back! that Heat Culture mustve worn off on them
"lance stephenson avery bradley and boogie all have histories of ""allegedly"" abusing women"
Lakers are racking up a nice little roster of people who like to abuse women huh. first avery bradley and lance stephenson and now boogies coming back! that Heat Culture mustve worn off on them
"Yeah I would likely agree with you tbh, I don’t see what hole Lonzo fills but I could see Van Gundy getting Duncan open a few more times. What ever happened to Avery Bradley?"
"They’re both shooting near 39% and Lonzo is a near elite defender, is great in transition, and can push the pace which is exactly what the Heat need. Avery Bradley is almost always injured anyways. Please tell how Duncan Robinson is a net positive over Lonzo?"
Marcus Morris truly is greater Morris.  We used to call him that in Detroit when people thought Markief was the better twin.  We shouldn’t have traded him for Avery Bradley because that led to the Blake Griffin trade which was nothing good
"&gt; I wouldn't really consider that ""outplaying"" anyone when it's not like he went off during his minutes. He was good on defense though I guess ill give him that.  Right, because you're looking at mostly Romeo's scoring. We put him on [LeBron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVW2zzd_L4k) and [Harden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlLxf50L81Y)...   We had a rookie, who had barely any experience in the NBA due to missing time with injuries, guarding LeBron James and James Harden last season. On a team that already had Smart, Brown, Tatum and Hayward as defensive options.   That's promising.  &gt;Romeo was not promising. 2.5 ppg on 35 FG% and 18 3p% is absolutely atrocious.  And Terry Rozier averaged 1.8 on 22/29 splits and Avery Bradley averaged 1.7 on 34/0 splits.   Our team regularly relegates rookies to empty offensive roles. It doesn't mean they aren't showing promise.   You have to actually watch these guys play. You can't just camp the boxscores."
They need another big man. And they signed Avery Bradley to start the year.. go after a forward or center
"we were absolutely ravaged by covid at the beginning of the season but there’s absolutely no excuse for losing as many games as we have at this point in the season. yeah, Dragic and Avery Bradley are hurt right now but that’s still not an excuse. We don’t have a good PF and Jimmy and Bam are our only good defenders; combine that with the fact that our offense is inconsistent at best and unwatchable at worst"
"He's a solid role player who has his moments. In the playoffs last year he got more minutes (because Avery Bradley was injured) and he really stepped it up. Even started in the Finals.  He is a meme, but more because of his appearance than him not being a good player."
Yeah it was a big asking price but come playoff time who gives a fuck about depth.  Imagine the Heat running out a lineup of Dragic/Harden/Butler/Iggy/Bam with some vet min depth off the bench alongside Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk...
"We did, Avery Bradley was supposed to help a lot with our defense but he got injured."
"No Dragon, no Avery Bradley, somehow Kelly Olynyk is our starting 4 (he should never be a starter, off bench yes but starter no), and team learned how to deal with Robinson.  Team needs a 3 and D starting 4. And needs to wake up and learn how to hit 3's again because our 3 point shooting has gone way down hill."
2013/2014 Celtics.  Jeff Green [hit a buzzer beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jCq6HjIJGw&amp;ab_channel=huff99) against the heat and it is still one of my favorite memories. Jordan Crawford/Avery Bradley/ Gerald Wallace/ Jeff Green/ KellyOlynyk was a hell of a lineup
Damn Avery Bradley must’ve been working dudes in high school
Avery Bradley 4th 😂
To add some random Info Avery Bradley went to the same University as KD. Texas!
"Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, Robert Williams, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye, and Avery Bradley aren’t NBA players I guess"
"Looking back now it looked like an all time fleece tbh. Blake for Tobi and Bobi (traded to 76ers to grind up picks for PG13), Avery Bradley (then traded for JaMychal Green who was great) and 2018 1st (that they traded up for SGA (included in PG13 trade). Wow"
"We should’ve traded Blake last year and kept C wood but typical pistons office, I’m from the D and I’m tired of this team, we draft kcp over the Greek freak we draft Luke kennard over don Mitchell, we gave Reggie to much money we gave up T Harris Avery Bradley and boban for Blake and now we needa trade him, shit is a waste of time, not to mention we give up our franchise center who’s been leading league rebounding for years for fucking Brandon knight and I never even seen him this whole year, we draft killigan hates over obi toppin shit crazy, grant is pretty good but 60 mil cmon man that’s way to much, at this point idk what we should do we have nothing. We should’ve found a way to trade Reggie for Kemba but we dropped the ball so bad if we were gonna get rid of Drummond and Reggie we could’ve used them in a big trade package, our roster is shit and we really have no players that anyone want we just gotta pray pistons fans hopefully the new GM knows what he’s doing because he did a good job in OKC"
"He did. And to be fair to ainge trading the consensus number 1 pick and drafting brown a few spots earlier than everybody thought he should go were both incredible moves that were scrutinized at the time. However, they were still both top 3 picks at the end of the day which gm's can ill-afford to miss on. He's also had a bit of success late in the draft throughout his gm tenure. Rondo, avery bradley, etwaun moore, terry rozier, abdel nader, robert willams, and payton pritchard. However recently he's had many, many chances to draft players in the middle of the first round and in the second round and so far has missed on a lot of them. Most are completly out of the league and although it's still very early in guys like grant williams, aaron nesmith, carsen edwards, tremont waters, and romeo langford's careers it's not looking great so far."
"From the mentioned SMART, Avery Bradley and Rozier are similar or better. And We are not including recent picks which seem very promising"
"you do realize you're talking about the same coach that revitalized the careers of IT, avery bradley, jae crowder and evan turner. and flush away potential? the only season you can say that is the 2018-19 season. we overachieved in every single other season brad has coached us. he's overseen the developments of the jays and put them in a position to succeed. brad has his faults but player development is not even CLOSE to one of them"
The only important guys still out are Dragic and Avery Bradley
Don’t feel bad. Avery Bradley let book drop 70 on him
Lol took me a long ass time to realize AB was Avery Bradley. Maybe I do have alcohol poisoning...
Nope not new info. Add Avery Bradley too
"yeah anyone who criticized his time in Detroit kept getting ""it wasn't his fault it was the roster's"" ""it was because he was GM and coach"". everyone kept referring to his Orlando stint, which yeah was revolutionary at the time, but it's been 12 fucking years since then. the rest of the league has caught up with that Orlando offensive and defensive schemes.  dude was a straight trash coach in detroit whose primary offensive plays were ""Andre Drummond post up"" or ""dribble hand off long two for avery bradley or whatever SG is on the roster"".  he hasn't adapted to 2021 NBA and he was a bad hire. props on Orlando but the man is riding off a decades long reputation that isn't deserved anymore."
"&gt; hasn't been locked in a hotel for 80 days in Florida.  No one was locked in a hotel during the bubble. Players could leave the bubble at any time. Some of them declined to even enter the bubble in the first place, such as Avery Bradley. If any player valued 80 days with their wife and kids so much, they could've also declined like Bradley did.   KD was also injured. No player in the league would trade their Achilles for not being ""locked"" in a resort."
Avery Bradley when he was on the Celtics.
The answer is Avery Bradley.  Ugh lol
Steph always cooked Jrue and AD on the Pelicans. Detroit KCP and Celtics Avery Bradley used to do a much better job guarding him.
Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley was like 5/6 lol
"And they're still injured. They were missing Avery Bradley, Dragic and Herro tonight"
"Jimmy missed a month between injuries and Covid. They were complete shit without him, and are good, but not great with him. He's played at an MVP level since coming back at Covid, but they really miss Jae Crowder and the new additions (Avery Bradley primarily) suck. Dragic has been in and out of the lineup too, and Herro and Robinson didn't improve much from the bubble."
"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They’ll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn’t fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they’ve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won’t be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"I agree. Just like players like Avery Bradley decided to opt out of the bubble stars could just do the same for the all-star weekend.  It would not be the same if superstars like LeBron, KD or Giannis don't play, but at least we would have a game full of players who would get their 1st shot at an all-star game and would probably be more competitive.  Overall if the NBA needs the revenue they will do it, and I'm sure many players would like to play in the game no matter the circumstance, so if someone opts out, they can easily be replaced, it's not like the league doesn't have talent to do so."
Same people hating on Avery Bradley for not playing the bubble smh
im so high I thought it said Avery Bradley for a sec lmao
I haven't heard much but Avery Bradley or DJ off the Rockets? Veterans who don't fit the Rockets' immediate future. I read somewhere that they're keeping Olynyk though.  Hassan Whiteside will be gone but I can see the Kings waiting for the offseason first.
I mean...yea. Fucking Rockets.  Y'all could've had Ben Simmons except your trash organization was too petty to trade with the GM you chased away. Or at least kept LeVert.   Instead you got back...Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley on expiring deals. The four first round draft picks are all awful - Brooklyn and one from Milwaukee.
"have you considered that you acquiring Griffin from the Los Angeles Clippers for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic, a 2018 protected first-round pick, and a 2019. The 2018 ended up being Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.... what you got in return was 2 years of dead cap"
"Smart for a time machine, Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley, who says no?"
"I think last year's team would have suffered far worse with these injuries compared to this years team. Schroeder and THT cant replace LeBron's distribution and ball handling, but they're doing a lot better than Avery Bradley and regular season Rondo would have done"
additional potential exceptions would be Avery Bradley and Evan Turner.
"* COVID took out Butler for some time. He has missed 15 games in total so far. That's almost 30%. He's needed for everything to work with the way the HEAT plays. * Avery Bradley was basically injured and unplayable for his HEAT tenure. He was supposed to be a key player. * Dragic also had a string of injuries for much of the season. He's still clearly not 100%. * Nunn was still not a 100% for like the first half of the season. The dude seems to be experiencing long COVID issues. * Moe Harkless was the Jae Crowder filler - he didn't pan out. Leonard got injured early and was out for the rest of the season. That left us with a a PF-C rotation of BAM - Kelly - Achiuwa. It should then be obvious how F'ed up that was.  * Because of the injuries, Herro and Duncan had to play a more active role together with Bam for like the first half of the season. Herro was forced to be playmaker, of which he was still not. Duncan lacked primary offensive threats which are needed for him to be effective. Look at them now when the HEAT are healthy, back to their old trusty role player ways.  There was a stretch when the HEAT was basically relying on Bam, Kelly, Duncan, Herro, Vincent, Strus, Achiuwa, and Silva. Pre-trade, it was Bam, Kelly, and Duncan who were the only available and consistent players for much of the season.   At the end of the day, the HEAT are victims of the COVID and injuries. Remove those, and they should have at the very least a strong hold on the 4th seed with the 3rd on a spitting distance."
"1. John Wall  2. Tracy McGrady  3. Hakeem Olajuwon  4. Dwight Howard  5. Chauncey Billups  6. Derrick Rose  7. Rajon Rondo  8. Bradley Beal  9. Avery Bradley  10. Michael Jordan  To change it to people I grew up watching, I'd swap out Hakeem and MJ for Kobe and Paul Pierce"
"I mean you can classify it however. Avery Bradley just wasn't that good at that aspect of defense. He's good at hounding the ball handler and gave a lot of effort, but lacking in a lot of key defensive areas. In the end, that combination made him a solid defender, but not really the all defensive player that his reputation suggested."
"&gt; Avery Bradley  Tall about another Celtic that's virtually out of the league after some great seasons.... I really thought he was going to grow more, after leaving the Cs. Hated to see him go. But barely hear of him anymore."
Turns out Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart are pretty good at defense
"I think a part of this is how much turnover there was a in a span of a few years. In hindsight a lot of those guys should’ve been moved for assets, but at the time we were trying to compete around Kyrie and that wouldn’t have made any sense back then.  Now they’re in a position where they need to develop players again to either use as trade pieces to bring in veteran talents like the ones you mentioned who left better than they came or develop into rotational guys to keep for some time like we did with players like Terry Rozier or Avery Bradley.   That can’t happen right away, so we came into this season without much wiggle room because guys had to step up — some guys did, but mostly it’s been a mixed bag with improvements in some parts of guys’ games and regression in others. That hasn’t been helped by a ton of games lost to Covid and injuries which has made it harder for the team to find a consistent rhythm and pecking order. With the lack of wiggle room and the degree to which things went to shit after a hot start it’s not shocking the team is struggling."
Don’t really have one this year but it used to be Avery Bradley
"You gotta put the C’s in there I feel.   Developed Tatum, Jaylen (who came into the league not good), Timelord who’s clearly a top center in the league after looking lost for some times, Smart, Rozier who flourished here, Avery Bradley who went from really bad to very good, and more.  I think people leave them out because of their few draft misses but the development staff seems super strong."
"The good thing is ""that other guy who would get you stuck in the middle of the pack forever"" has a huge trade value, or at the very least higher than Victor Oladipo and Avery Bradley... and if you don't like a player you can always trade him to another team and get something in return.      The mental gymnastics some Rockets fans are going thru to not accept the fact that their franchise made one of the worst trades in recent history."
Smh forgetting the mega assets Olynyk and Avery Bradley they got in that absolute haul for James Harden
"I was expecting him to be decent from what I've seen before he came to LA but he's been a hound, constantly picking up full court and putting a ton of pressure on the ball handler. He's basically a better version of what Avery Bradley was last year on defense"
nah bro its superstars Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk lmao
"Point guard defense is even more useless in the playoffs unles you're a tall point guard that can switch, even elite smaller point guards will get abused in switches, for example people used to say Avery Bradley was elite but he was like 6'2 and people would just abuse him in the post   Versatility is important, on ball defense of point guard is practically useless"
Well y'all did get Avery Bradley and Kelly olynyk instead
Yeah you guys are way better with Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk who needs him
"&gt;The 3 pt% for Ingram doesn’t matter much on so few attempts.  Yes, it does.  A percentage is a percentage, and it is not easier to shoot less frequently.  In fact, it's way easier to shoot when you are the unquestioned number one option on a team, and cannot be benched -- both luxuries Ingram never had in Los Angeles.  &gt;Ft% is the best indicator of shooting and he jumped from high 60s in la to 85% in no.   Not if the player still misses from the field at the same rate.  The best indicator of shooting is the percentage the player shoots -- Ingram's effective FG% rose less between his 3rd and 4th seasons than between his 2nd and 3rd.  &gt;They be deeper but not better offensively. Ball and hart don’t add that much offensive value and are taking away minutes from others.   Ball ( 12/7 on 55% effective ) is an upgrade over Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, and Dion Waiters.  Hart ( 10/2 on 53% effective plus 7 rebounds ) is better than a couple of those guys, too.  &gt; New Orleans but he didn’t have great help most years outside jrue   Anderson/Evans/Gordon/Holiday should be enough for Davis to reliably make the playoffs.  It was not.  Most years, they weren't even close.  &gt;  If ad misses a buzzer beater it’s 3-2.   And if he shoots better than 11 for 23, a buzzer beater isn't necessary.  More to the point, there's no reason Ingram, Ball, Hart, or some other Laker could not have hit those shots.  It's not like Davis is a good three-point shooter -- he's worse than all those guys.  &gt;There is nothing to outbid for Miami, butler got a max contract with them.   There was still a trade that required matching or beating.  The point is, Butler would've been a Laker if Davis wasn't.  And no one was beating James + Butler + Ingram + the deepest team in the league.  They might've swept the playoffs.  And that team would be even more unbeatable this season, and for years to come, and would still have most of their draft picks.  &gt; traded is irrelevant, brogdon wanted to go there.   Apart from a few years of the Kobe Bryant era, no player has ever not wanted to be a Laker.  In the unlikely event that Brogdon did not, the Lakers still had tons of depth and assets to trade for a litany of other players."
WTF is Avery Bradley doing??
"Romeo looks like Avery Bradley did, but taller and longer. I’m really excited  Also having another guy in Fournier who can shoot, drive a close out and make a basic pass out of that is doing fucking wonders for us"
"How bout avery bradley, Eric gordon and a second round pick?"
Still much better than Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk tho lmao
"Starter: **Mark Blount**  *Honorable mention: Ricky Davis*  -  Regular bench rotation guy: **Phil Pressey** (hard to believe there was a season where undrafted rookie Phil Pressey played 15 mpg over 75 games and started 11 times)  *Honorable mentions: Semi Ojeleye, Jeff Teague, Orien Greene, Sebastian Telfair*  -  End-of-bench guy with only a few minutes here and there: **Tremont Waters**  *Honorable mentions: Carsen Edwards, Guershon Yabusele, rookie Terry Rozier, rookie Avery Bradley*"
Lmao he listed Avery Bradley as one of the players for the Lakers. Thats all the proof needed OP doesnt know shit
"These guys are obviously casuals lol. Let’s think of those IT teams... IT, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Amir Johnson, and Al Horford, with Smart, Jerebko, T. Zeller, 22yo Rozier, and 20yo JB off the bench.   Imagine saying “IT made Brad look way better than he is” with a roster like that haha. r/nba is filled with some of the dumbest people lol."
And they’d still have gotten effectively nothing franchise-changing for harden except for some middle schooler and half a year of Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk
"In a vacuum - how is Harden for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and picks in the late 20s equitable value?"
I think the screwed up that trade - they traded Harden for a bunch of late round picks and essentially Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley...
I would assume Avery Bradley was some sort of NBA god by his way of acting during the bubble times and the LA fans reaction to him not playing.
All he has to really be is bigger Avery Bradley with playmaking and the trade is worth it lol
"Levert to Oladipo to Kelly Olynk and Avery Bradley and now your telling me that the Rockets are going to sign Olynk?  Am I taking crazy pills or is that *maybe* not the best asset management?  Also, I'm not roasting your team, I just genuinely feel bad that you got a cheapskate owner. No need to take shots, but for what its worth we were above 500 and in the 4 spot in the east despite a 2-8 start, and then our team got hit with COVID and we had a 1-13 month. This is probably a blessing in disguise because we get to add a lotto, maybe even top 5 pick, have a ton of cap space, and get younger all in one stroke."
"And average bench players are necessary to win when you’re in the playoffs? They barely had 3 point shooting in the first place, 20 minutes of a reliable floor spacer + decent defender  is quite valuable. He definitely made an impact on their postseason, especially with Avery Bradley out"
Pickswap (between Nets and Mia IIRC) and Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley.
"I mean.. Brad took a team to the playoffs and his leading starters were:  * Avery Bradley * Tyler Zeller * Evan Turner * Jared Sullinger * Brandon Bass   Even the 2017-18 season, where people would say we had a lot of talent:  1. Were projected to win 37 games once Hayward went down 2. Were only the 5th NBA team in history to win 50+ games with an average age under 25 (tied 2nd best all time)"
They still need more help. KD should hit up Avery Bradley to request a buyout and join them.
"That 18 point lead didn’t last long, also Avery bradley is cheeks, no idea why he played so long😐"
avery bradley is the dude they traded levert for
"I'm pretty sure it was leaked at some point, Simmons Maxey Shake and 3 firsts. Houston instead got 4 firsts, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and 4 swaps most of which will likely be worthless."
"to my knowledge the picks you got are going to be trash. You're 99% not getting superstars with your #26 picks. Its not your fault just admit fertata and stone made an all time shitty trade.   &amp;#x200B;  even if you don't like simmons, you could have flipped him for some more picks or decent players.   &amp;#x200B;  you most definitely could have got simmons maxey 3-4 picks. instead you got avery bradley and what like 4 picks?"
my mans you got avery bradley instead of simmons. you basically traded simmons for avery bradley. And you could have got maxey too
You would have a much brighter future with Simmons &amp; Thybulle w/picks instead of Avery fucking Bradley and a coach who is considering jumping off a bridge on his very first year as a coach for the team. Stop lying to yourself lol
you would rather watch wall than simmons? His name is literally wall. Something thats made out of bricks. Watching wall at this point is like watching a movie thats so bad its funny. You could have gotten simmons and multiple picks and instead you got avery bradley and picks.   &amp;#x200B;  fertata chose bradley over simmons. one of the dumbest trades in sports history
hes better than fucking avery bradley. stone and fertata traded harden for fucking avery bradley.
"&gt;It’s interesting because he was drafted as a defensive prospect,  Yeah, I remember him being touted as an Avery Bradley in the draft."
So Kelly olynyk Avery Bradley and some pick swaps?
"Rondo *(technically)*, Terry Rozier, Avery Bradley"
"They're 'key' players in the same way Dwight, Javale, Avery Bradley, and Danny Green were. They can all be replaced relatively easily."
I kinda feel bad that we sent KO and Avery Bradley to said shit sandwich.
"Do you mean to tell me the best they would have gotten for LeVert is Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and a pick swap?"
"&gt; Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, a couple pick swaps and a few future firsts  That is a totally normal package, find a new Rainforest Cafe."
As opposed to superstar Avery Bradley and MVP Kelly Olynk?
"The 76ers reportedly offered Simmons, Thybulle and 2 firsts for Harden. Gotta think that package would’ve been better than... checks notes... Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, a couple worthless pick swaps and a few future firsts"
"Or at the very least, Chris Lavert. Rockets absolutely fucked up big time   It’s like if the Heat traded Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk straight up for harden"
Sure glad we we've got Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk.
"&gt; Stone on DJ Wilson: ""He (fits) in similarly to Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley as guys that can stabilize things and also help show our young guys how to play. He was definitely an important component.""  ""We feel he's really going to make an immediate impact in showing our borderline talent how to excel at receiving no minutes riding the deep bench."""
"he gave away a top 5 player with two years on his contract. It's not just that, he basically gave up levert for avery bradley. Idek what they got for jarret allen"
They chose Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk over Ben Simmons because their owner is man baby. Embarrassing for the NBA.
"Yeah but the perimeter guys are actually shooting worse this year.  Matthews was supposed to replace Danny green but he is shooting worse.  Avery Bradley actually shot ok last year but he's not here either.  Schroder might actually be a worse shooter than Rondo too.    They only guys who actually improved their percentage are LeBron and Kuzma, but LeBron is out obviously."
"Avery Bradley averaged 6.1 rebounds per game in his last season in Boston, but that went down to 2.4 when he arrived in Detroit"
[I'm sorry what](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2614395-report-blake-griffin-traded-to-pistons-for-avery-bradley-tobias-harris-more.amp.html)
If the nuggets have an open roster spot Avery Bradley might get bought out.
"Brandon Bass, Shane Battier, and Avery Bradley all had decent NBA careers, and PP is gonna be a Hall of Famer.  But I remember this game, it was not a good one."
Probably dreaming about a situation where Otto Porter Jr is possibly bought out. More realistic option would be getting Avery Bradley back or Moe Harkless.
Avery Bradley is smaller than me he isn’t a wing
Get Avery Bradley bring him back.
Avery Bradley buyout?
"We have Avery Bradley now, trade for Harden?"
"&gt;Drummond understands how much helping a team win a championship could skyrocket his value.  This is a myth.  Dwight got a 1 year, $2.3M contract. How did that ""skyrocket"" his value?  Javale took a $4.3M player option rather than test free agency (ie, he thought he'd get less than that on the open market).  Meanwhile, Avery Bradley didn't even play in the bubble, and got a bigger contract than either of them.  Marc Gasol helped a team win a title, and he only got the vet minimum. Trez stunk in the playoffs and got as much as Ibaka, who helped win a title - and Trez felt shorted by his contract.  Markieff got a tiny contract. Marcus, whose team flamed out in the playoffs, got way more money."
"The Rockets have Christian Wood, Avery Bradley, and DJ Augustin. And the Pistons have a bunch of future former Pistons. That's why I have those two as my true sleeper picks."
Don't forget Avery Bradley.
"Hey Brooklyn, Otto Porter, Avery Bradley, Hassan Whiteside, Jeff Teague are still waiting on ya."
You think Kelly O and Avery Bradley were traded for Harden?
Only cause he was forced to due to Avery Bradley and Pat Bev getting injured. His minutes didn’t skyrocket until Avery got traded away (blessed front office)
Definitely Contenders and that depth is amazing. That Lakers team is 3 MVPs/Top 25 players all time and A Dpoy.   That 2011 Celtics team . You have a Top 10 peak with a Top 20 peak and a couple of perennial all stars and very good role players.   Shaq  KG  Pierce   Allen   Jermaine O'neal  Rondo  Avery Bradley  Delonte West  Troy Murphy (deep cut)
"could’ve had a certified top 20ish player in Ben Simmons but instead Houston creates a super team in Brooklyn for Kelly Olynk, Avery Bradley, and a chance at a high pick in 6 years that might end up as someone as good as Ben Simmons. Or maybe they’ll get a Mario Hezonja"
"So, who were the ones that said Harden was fat and washed up. How many teams were willing to put an offer for Harden. It should've been more than 3-4 teams.   Who were the ones that said Blake was washed up?  And now LMA is the 3rd piece that moves the needle for the Nets? I get Harden was the needle that shifted for the Nets. But LMA and Blake still doesn't hide their defense. I thought Dieng and Avery Bradley were probably the two that they should've went for.  Shit, I thought they should've traded Dinwiddie for Plumlee and Ellington. Plumlee fits them so nicely."
Avery Bradley
"If you think there’s a better return for a superstar than Kelly Olynik, Avery Bradley and 7th graders then I want your dealers info"
Avery Bradley has played like ten games this year lol
"Until they could add guys like Avery Bradley, or Jeff Teague in FA sure"
Avery Bradley is joining the Nets.
Think it’s going to be Avery Bradley. KD trying to assemble the Brooklyn Longhorns! 🤘🏽
"&gt;He was a 19 yr old rookie lol.  And now he's a 20 year old second year player. And LeBron is 36. The title window is not gonna be open for that long.  &gt;KCP is shooting 40% from 3 on 4 attempts a game. Who are they finding on buyout better than that?  Avery Bradley (42% on 3.8 attempts), Wayne Ellington (43% on 6 attempts per game), Otto Porter (40% on 3.8 attempts). One of them will be bought out."
People viewed him as an undersized shooting guard and didn’t think he could be an NBA point guard. They also viewed him as a defensive prospect like Avery Bradley
"Realistic targets would be guys Avery Bradley, Wayne Ellington and Gorgui Dieng. Unrealistic would be guys like Drummond and Otto Porter jr, but still being targeted."
Rockets got Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk for Harden
yeah avery bradley and kelly olynyk are a deadly two-man combo and will be for years
Bradley news source: [Avery Bradley also not traveling.](https://twitter.com/anthony_chiang/status/1372040516938964994?s=21)
"Miami. They're actually the best defensive team since 2/18 (per a post on /r/heat) and the Lakers have dropped to #5. Overall, we're #5 due to an onslaught of injuries so our defense is much better than it record appears.  Also, we've been without Avery Bradley all season (easily our best guard defender) and Bam is currently out."
"As a fan who has watched every game this is honestly amazing because our defensive looks straight ass at times. We replaced really good defensive players like Danny Green, Avery Bradley and two mediocre bigs in Dwight/JaVale with worse or equal defenders. Dennis, Mathews, Gasol and Montrezl have not looked like an improvement to me as a fan. Maybe blowing 4th quarter leads when we didn't all last year adds to this feeling. Not sure, but appreciate the stat."
"Jimmy doesn’t have a case because of all the games he missed. Now if he was healthy and they had the best record in the east I would give him some MVP votes but last time I checked, Miami is about 6-7 games back from the 1st seed.   Bam needs to get healthy and so does Avery Bradley. Maybe add one additional piece and Miami could be a good team heading into the post season where no one wants to play them in the first round, especially the bucks."
"We've won 9 out of the last ten games. In that stretch, we have the number one rated defense in the league. We beat the Lakers and Utah. Goran was out for a while in that time and Bam has missed the last several games as well. Avery Bradley hasn't seen the floor since January."
Avery Bradley can’t guard James Harden tho. I think Davis might have been the best defender against him considering his ability to defend 1-5
Rockets more than likely. Give us Avery Bradley pre-covid shutdown and it's a tight series though imo.
"Lets actually look at this list....   **Good Picks**   Luke Harangody - played 70 games as a 52nd pick   Avery Bradley - Good starter in playoff runs for Boston   Etwaun Moore - long career, 594 games and counting, 191 starts as the 55th pick   Jared Sullinger - started 182 games for Boston as a pick in the 20s   Marcus Smart   Terry Rozier - 16th pick, mocked as 2nd round, started a ECFs run for Boston, playing great   Abdel Nader - currently playing in Phoenix, 184 games as the 58th pick   Jaylen Brown   Semi Ojeleye - rotation player drafted in the 2nd round   Jayson Tatum   Robert Williams   Payton Pritchard   **No Value Expected**   Kris Joseph   Marcus Thornton   Ben Bentil   Demetrius Jackson   Jabari Bird   Kadeem Allen   **Moderate Value**   Jordan Mickey - 64 games, 4 starts as a 2nd round pick   **Bad Picks**   Fab Melo   James Young   RJ Hunter - only 45 ganes as 28th pick, not that bad   Ante Zizic &amp; Guerschon Yabusele - not great picks but they needed to draft stashes   **Not Drafted by Boston**   Marshon Brooks   Lucas Nogueira   **To be decided**   Grant Williams - has already closed playoff games for Boston but has had minutes reduced this season   Romeo Langford - looked pretty good, but injured   Yam Madar    Aaron Nesmith"
"And before that, I wanna say it was probably Avery Bradley."
the Rockets traded Harden and ended up with Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk  Hennything is possible
"&gt;Hm Oladipo's right leg is falling apart this is second surgery on the same leg, I think you'd have to smoke some drugs to say Lavert is a concern like that.   Sure, if your goal is to stay mediocre for the next 5 years  &gt;You traded for Oladipo giving up Lavert and all you got was an expiring Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick in the 18-20 overall area. The Rockets did do a great job at staying mediocre you are right at that.  Both are expiring deals, picks can be traded, and the Rockets have a great young core including KPJ who is better than both Levert and Dipo.   Yeah, but I’m the one grasping for straws"
"Really grasping at straws to back your losing argument.  &gt; I'd say they're pretty equal  Hm Oladipo's right leg is falling apart this is second surgery on the same leg, I think you'd have to smoke some drugs to say Lavert is a concern like that.  &gt; Sure, if your goal is to stay mediocre for the next 5 years  You traded for Oladipo giving up Lavert and all you got was an expiring Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick in the 18-20 overall area. The Rockets did do a great job at staying mediocre you are right at that."
Victor Oladipo. We also got the shell of Avery Bradley in the deal.
"Olynyk wouldn't even be in the rotation. Anybody who says that the Heat are gonna miss him in the playoffs is a complete casual lol. Avery Bradley is easily the bigger loss. At least he provided something the Heat needed (point of attack guard defense). Now we just gotta hope Kendrick Nunn doesn't go on one of his cold streaks, because we're gonna need him."
"No, but they had the choice of taking those two players or Oladipo, and they chose Oladipo and then swapped him for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley, both on expiring contracts, so it kinda works out the same."
Avery Bradley then? I can't think of a 3&amp;D PG that is a roleplayer but has the size to makeup for AI.   FVV?
And KJ literally isnt even an option?  Wall-KPJ-EricGordon-Wood-Olynyk-Tate-Augustin-House-Avery Bradley  get the ball before KJ does
"The Celtics have plenty of options to improve the team, including multiple TPE’s and all of there future picks. People always vastly overstate how locked into a roster a team is. They also vastly overrated cap space.  Celtics draft record in the teens is quite good. Rozier and Avery Bradley were taken 16th and 19th.  I’m sure you will mention Yabusele without including the context that it was a draft and stash out of necessity to have cap space to sign Horford."
Bill Bradley Beal  Avery Bradley Beal
We never sat or rested players. We also never traded a superstar for Olynyk and Avery Bradley.
"Weve also had integral guys out for a while. Butler was out for a while because of covid. He, herro, and dragic have all missed ~20 games each this season. Avery Bradley barely played for us before we traded him because of covid and injury. Victor oladipo has barely played for us since the trade.  But yes, I do agree with your last sentence."
"Yes. Led the Celtics to a 1st seed while avging 29 ppg while having a worst cast around him than current celtics. IT had avery bradley, jae crowder, horford and smart lol"
Could’ve also has Jarett Allen and Caris Levert instead of kelly olynk and avery bradley lol
"&gt; in a normal season I would have thought they would have faced a tougher playoff road than the east by having to face the Clippers instead of exhausted Rockets and Nuggets teams.   The Clippers had injury problems all last season, so if anything they had some benefit to Paul George and Pat Beverley getting time off to recuperate from their regular season injuries, as well as Kawhi getting extra time to rest his quad (of course, Beverley got hurt again in the bubble anyway though, because that seems to be the pattern with him). The Clippers would have been ill suited to play the Nuggets either way though. The break didn't cause their roster to have no one to match up with Jokic, that was their roster construction all along. I think to simply assume the Clippers would have beaten Denver if not for the break is a massive assumption. Look at them this year: the Clippers *still* have no answer for Jokic.   On top of that, right before the league shut down the Lakers had commanding wins over both the Bucks and the Clippers. If any team was really rolling before the shutdown it was the Lakers. They were just able to regain that momentum once the bubble happened, but what we saw from them was just more of the same, rather than them getting some boost. Keep in mind that the bubble cost the Lakers their starting point guard in Avery Bradley."
2020 Lakers  AD  LeBron  Dwight  Danny Green  JaVale  Caruso  KCP  Avery Bradley
"prior to 19-20 wasn't he facilitating more from the wing/paint after a guard brought the ball up the court?  It wasn't until the lakers started with no clear primary ball handler (Lebron, Avery Bradley, Danny Green, AD, Javale) that Lebron was outright called the point guard."
Good game 76er bros. You guys got a fucking squad. Good luck in the playoffs.   Avery Bradley is so fucking washed. Anthony Lamb and Kenyon Martin Jr. had very nice games though.
Avery Bradley
"The voting process for the All Team selections is pretty garbage. Like l stated, it's a popularity contest. There's no reason a guard like Jrue Holiday only has 2 All Defensive team selections when players all over the league (Damian Lillard, KD, JJ Reddick, Andre Igudola, etc.) say he's the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  Same thing with Jonathan Issac, Tony Allen for some early years, Jimmy Butler, Avery Bradley, AK-47, Robert Covington, and plenty of other players who were shafted in place of bigger names.  An NBA game is 48 minutes star players typically play 75% of that at 36mpg which is also where most of a games production occurs. If he is playing 20+ mpg  during productive stretches on the best team in his conference, which is also a title contender, l don't see how he isn't in the conversation. He plays ~10 minutes less than Ben (DPOY candidate) and Joel (an MVP candidate). That's less than a game's quarter. He has a plus / minus that shows his impact and it's all on the defensive end.  Dejounte Murray played roughly the same amount when he was selected. Tony Allen and PatBev had similar minutes as well in their years.  Don't look at other NBA outlets and analyst, see what the people he guards say about his defense. I presented the stats now go listen to his peers."
Avery Bradley and KCP use to do really good on him. I’d imagine Jrue too but none of them come close to Delly game 2
"I posted this elsewhere here, but here are your lowest 20 per 36 Marvel Point accumulators (min 500 MP).   |Player|MHP per 36| :--|--:| |Wesley Matthews|8.5| |Rodney Hood|8.5| |Isaac Okoro|9.6| |Gary Clark|9.6| |Chasson Randle|9.7| |P.J.

"Boston lost its entire depth because its players left.   Boston (and any team for that matter) cant just replace guys with rookies and hope to compete.  You’re completely misunderstanding the situation.  Boston is struggling because Rozier, Kyrie, Hayward, Horford all left the team within a year, and it’s literally impossible to replace that kind of production with rookies.  As for Ainge’s supposed draft problems, here’s a friendly reminder that he drafted Perkins, Rondo, Avery Bradley, E’Twawn Moore (55th pick), Olynyk, Rozier, Smart, Brown, Tatum, Robert Williams. All of them being at the very worst servicable players, and at the very best all-stars/superstars."
"Agree, people just fail to comprehend its a different circumstance, its that simple. This is the same sub that called Avery Bradley a hypocrite because he decided to sit out the bubble but decided to play again this season."
The new owner is a man baby who chose Kelly Olynk and Avery Bradley over Ben Simmons out of spite and has destroyed the franchise within 2 years. Outside of the Knicks there probably aren’t many teams who wouldn’t lose tons of support over shit like that.
"That's the right play, too, but you'd be stunned at how many NBA guys don't make it. If someone on your team is doubled, roll to the basket. It opens up the whole floor.   When Avery Bradley was on the Celtics he did this like clockwork. As soon as somebody was doubled he just rolled to the rim and it usually opened up a great look."
"We were up by like 20 at halftime, and the Suns never really had a chance to win it, they just kept feeding Booker.   The only thing people are mad about is Broussard saying Avery Bradley was guarding Booker this game and that's why AB shouldn't make All-Defense. Even though Bradley didn't play."
&gt;There was then a second round of backlash because of dumbass Chris Broussard saying he left Avery Bradley off his all defense team because Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics.  But why get mad at Booker for something Broussard said?
"It was mostly praise by national media and headlines.  It was a lot of backlash from the vocal minority of nerds and salty Celtics fans (like me) on here.  There was then a second round of backlash because of dumbass Chris Broussard saying he left Avery Bradley off his all defense team because Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics.  Bradley did not play that game, which in theory should have bolstered his case.  &amp;#x200B;  I think the Broussard situation is why I wouldn't want stat-fixing to happen.  If you don't watch the game and aren't aware of the stat-fixing, you'll have to deal with too many nephews with too many bad takes."
&gt;though that was largely addition by subtraction due to losing Avery Bradley  I dont think people realize how hard it is [to have 2 starters on a 48 win team have a net rating this bad](https://go.nba.com/674m). I only spent like a minute scanning through this but [for this year the worst 2 man lineup combo I could find amongst starters on a winning team was Reddish/Collins -3.1](https://go.nba.com/xc1i) nearly 7 pts better than Bradley/Gortat lol
"Gallinari was the best player on that team, which is why we didn't lose a step--indeed, we got better--after the trade deadline (though that was largely addition by subtraction due to losing Avery Bradley).  That said, I do think Tobias is probably a bit better Siakam just because he's a much better shooter. But it's very close, and their skillsets are pretty different anyway so it's tough to compare them."
"&gt;It would be worse if I still had any faith in this team to win a winnable game  How about just be a fan of the team that's learning to rediscover itself, whilst asking Jaylen and Jayson to create offense which they never thought they'd do in their lives?  I assume you guys weren't around for Avery Bradley at the PG..."
"Ainge has had 3 top 10 draft picks. Two of them above 5. Both players taken at 3 are better than Russell and Ball. One is better than Ingram, and Jaylen is damn close to equal to Ingram.   Russell was an all star, he had that one good year, but he hasn't been anywhere near the expectations of a #2 pick outside of that year. You had the cap space for Randle, but decided you wanted to sign other free agents over keeping Randle. Again, that points to him not being a good draft pick by the Lakers. You've drafted decent role players, and the Celtics have too. Ainge drafted Rozier, Robert Williams, Tony Allen, Avery Bradley (he was good, but injuries added up). It's hilarious how you said Ainge has been trash, yet the Celtics have had a single lottery pick of their own in the last decade you've mentioned. Every other one has been another teams pick. Please explain how horrible it is for the team to have made the players every year but one. The Lakers could't manage that, even after multiple number 2 picks and getting LeBron. Must be that ""incredible"" drafting by the Lakers. You'd think if it was so incredible then four top 10 picks and the #1 or #2 best player of all time would at least get you in the playoffs."
"Trading James Harden to a team with Durant and Irving for a shit sandwich return of Olynyk, Avery Bradley and some swaps they don’t even have full control over has to be up there.   Oh. I forgot 20 games of sub 40% shooting from Dipo."
If he's healthy he can be fine as a 5th option. As a defender. As a cutter. He still works real hard. Hits catch and shoot 3s. Rework his game and imagine bigger Avery Bradley
"But bruh they got 20 games of shitty Oladipo, Olynyk and Avery Bradley.  Tell me that’s not an absolute haul for a guy like James Harden."
You get Kelly onlynk Avery Bradley Dante exum 4 1st and 4 pick swaps
"Yeah, I totally agree.   2015-16 we were totally stacked with Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Jae Crowder and Amir Johnson. What coach wouldn’t have made that lineup a top 10 offense and top 5 defense?  Add Horford to that mix everyone knew we were going to the Conference Finals.   And the year after that, I mean *I* could’ve coached rookie Tatum to game 7 of the conference finals against LeBron.   And after losing Kyrie two years later, it’s no wonder we went a round further than than the year before.   This is easy stuff. Brad hasn’t proved anything yet, and probably never will."
"Everyone conveniently forgets that the Lakers actually were shit in the bubble reg season at first as the Bubble was hurting them at first. They peaked right before the shutdown with guys like Avery Bradley shooting 50% from 3 for the past month who the Lakers lost the whole Bubble, and it took a while for them to improve in the Bubble.  It's not a miracle that they played better; they got a wake up call in Game 1 vs Portland and the role players stepped up accordingly. Of course they'll have to again, but we've already been shooting better in the past couple weeks compared to earlier this year (where we shot like &lt;25% for weeks).   As long as the role players' shooting is average, they'll have a good chance."
"Bro a Avery Bradley hit a GW 3 pointer in an Eastern Conference Finals game...that statement shouldn’t be reality, but we have a pandemic so fuck everything right"
I’ve seen teams trade their franchise player for Kelly Olynik and Avery bradley. Anything can happen.
Avery Bradley +23 and 50% from 3 lmao
"Man there were Laker fans tweeting out shit like ""fuck Avery Bradley"" and getting thousands of likes on them when he opted out of the bubble. That dude was a fringe rotation guys and caught hate.   So yes absolutely the fans would go apeshit if a star did it. People are just inherently selfish after all"
Cause they are. Avery Bradley was doing the same thing when he played for y'all
"Hes 24 already and has only scored above 13 points once in 120 career games and is averaging 3.8 points. He basically has no offensive game so he will likely be like Andre Roberson,Avery Bradley or Tony Allen"
"&gt;Houston didn’t have leverage but we’re still able to get a huge return  Houston definity didn't get a great return. What is it now, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and 12 8th Graders?"
"For the playoff, it would be more than manageable but, in the situation the Lakers were in, it would have been DS, KCP, and THT going out - three players who have stepped it up a lot recently. There weren't many other buyout players out there either (Otto Porter and Avery Bradley didn't get bought out). Maybe Lakers would have made the trade if LeBron/AD were healthy."
[Avery Bradley and John Wall pop out of the tank]
Avery Bradley was really nice for those last two seasons in Boston.
"I remember a game or two where avery bradley clamped him, but it's really rare and doesn't happen more than once in a series"
"I mean you don’t think Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and some 12 year-old out of Oakland right now is a good return for Harden?  Please."
"Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and a ton of first rounders in several years that will probably amount to nothing for a top 5 player 🚀📉"
Fuck Levert bring me Kelly Olynk and Avery Bradley 😂
"the year Isaiah had, he was gonna get paid if he stayed healthy. 29 points and 6 assists leading Boston to 50 wins and ECF as literally the only all star on a team where the second scoring option was Avery Bradley followed by a slumping Al Horford. That was literally a superstar calibre year."
Avery Bradley was a beast on that IT Celtics team. Pretty sure he led them in rebounds even though he’s only 6’2
"Acting like Avery Bradley and Olynyk are game changers is funny, they basically got Oladipo for free (don't know what's up with his injury) and George Hill is gonna play for the Sixers eventually"
Bro you traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. The Sixers package was infinitely better and basically every analyst worth his or her salt has acknowledged you by it yourselves a shit sandwich because of petty Fertitta.   I do like Porter and Wood and Silas for you guys though.  Good luck.
When the Rockets traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley instead of Ben Simmons because their owner was petty petty Tom Petty.
Avery Bradley did shit for the Heat and Olynyk and the Heat went as far as they could. Might as well take a chance on a potential floor raiser.
Imagine trading Kelly and Avery Bradley for an expiring contract that gets injured immediately.
I always love after a national game for those few days where people stop talking shit about Ben Simmons because they witness how undeniably effective he is at winning basketball games.   Like I won’t deny he’s infuriating in the stretches where he takes his foot off the pedal offensively.   But he’s absolutely elite at every other part of the game.   And Houston traded Harden for Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley instead of him lmfao
"Jimmy had covid, but Heat lost Meyers Leonard (good riddance) for season early on, and lost a bunch of games from Herro, Bam, and Dragic with injuries. Avery Bradley basically sat all year with injuries and then got traded for Victor Oladipo who is now also probably out for the season."
"Let’s put him up there with Patrick Beverly, Marcus Smart, Andre Roberson, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley and Andrew Bogut since were handing out flowers for SIXTH PLACE FOR DPOY."
"They'd beat the Knicks, the shitty Bucks/hobbled Nets, and hobbled Clips, Suns, Jazz. You can only play who's in front of you, and I can see them beating all those teams.  Regardless, you'll hear no argument from me there. Since Jordan retired, and outside of literally like 3 years, the East has been horrifically bad. It's an actual disgrace of a conference that is filled with incompetent management. My least favorite part is how heady Bron fans get about all his finals appearances. He managed to beat like 4, if that, threatening teams over a 9 year span, congrats? Those Avery Bradley-led Celtics really showed off the best of the league in the ECF."
Lakers were missing Avery Bradley last season
"Difference is Lakers didn't play injured teams to get to the finals. And before the Finals started Lakers were big favorites over the healthy Heat anyways.  Moreover, the Lakers were missing a starter the entire playoffs too in Avery Bradley."
I don’t follow him but he did say Avery a Bradley shouldn’t be all defensive because he let Booker score 70 points even though I don’t think Bradley played in that game.
Avery Bradley +23 and 50% from 3 lmao
"Everything you said.  Zion's style meshes best with a stretch 3&amp;D big in the mold of Ibaka, not only to space on defense snd but have the length to guard the paint on defense.  Lonzo is an up temp floor general which also suits a young Zion and BI.   Other than that, Pels need savvy veterans with a calming lockerroom presence. Maybe 3&amp;D vets like Danny Green, Otto Porter, Avery Bradley, Covington, Ariza, PJ."
"Tony Allen, Jrue Holiday, Pat Beverly, Avery Bradley,"
"&gt;I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not “cheap”  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn’t the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn’t he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren’t cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren’t exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don’t have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don’t have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don’t trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don’t know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I’ll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there’s a high chance of us bringing back. So you’re talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that’s 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you’re in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that’s fine.   Now I don’t even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we’re talking about the Lakers."
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
Lol his draft comp was Avery Bradley.
What about Avery Bradley when he was here? He can be had for cheap. Or Batum for cheap? And sign back Dwight or Noel for cheap.
"There are quite a few Seattle area guys in the league.  George Karl helped create the high level AAU scene in the early 90s, and the area has been creating NBA guys regularly ever since.  Murray, Zach Lavine, Avery Bradley, Kevin Porter, Matisse Thybulle, Jaden McDaniels."
"They didn't start winning until Shaq got his shit together, as soon as he did, three-peat. As soon as he stopped, Miami. The Miami title was terrible coaching by Avery Bradley."
"Ehh, KG had Tony Allen, Rajon Rondo, and Avery Bradley with him in Boston. Even a couple years of PJ Brown, James Posey, and Rasheed Wallace just to name a few."
Etwaun Moore Kelly Olynyk Avery Bradley  Rajon Rondo Al Jefferson Tony Allen
"Dude threw old ass Ariza, Rodney Hood, Danuel House and Zach fucking Collins in there 💀💀💀  By that logic we missed 21 games of Avery Bradley and 5 games of Playoff Rondo so it pretty much cancels out!"
Chris Broussard left Avery Bradley off his ballots for both All-Defense teams in 2017 cause Devin Booker dropped 70 on the Celtics... In a game Avery Bradley missed due to being sick in the hospital.
Avery Bradley not getting an All Defensive vote from 1 guy because Devin Booker scored 70 in a game he didn't play.
"Lmao   Celtics in the Steven’s era  have never blown a 2 game lead or not lost to the best team in the conference, or a series they have been expected to win. They’ve been swept except Lebrons first year back in CLE when best starter on the team was Avery Bradley"
"Discounting the Oladipo loss because “he was a pacer in the offseason” dismisses the fact that other players were traded *for* him. It’s not like we added him after a buyout. Olynyk as a stretch 4/5 would’ve been big against Milwaukee’s strategy of playing drop coverage and daring us to shoot. Avery Bradley would’ve been able to defend better than the guards we had out there, while still being a capable 3 point threat. Oladipo was supposed to be a piece of the cake, not just the icing on top."
"The ring doesn't count? There shouldn't have been playoffs? Well, that doesn't seem fair to the teams that busted their ass to get to the playoffs and win the title that year.   The bubble was equal conditions for all teams, and if any one of them lost despite having all of their players, sorry, but they weren't mentally tough enough to beat everyone on a more even playing field.  People say the Lakers had it easier with the bubble. If you really want to split hairs about the Lakers, they were coming off a hot start after All Star break, which got taken away from them when the pandemic hit. Then, all of a sudden they have to play in the bubble, without Avery Bradley, and without the homecourt advantage they busted their ass for. They still ended up beating almost every team in 5 games, except for the heat, who they very nearly beat in 5 before winning the next game... People aren't using their head if they don't think the Lakers wouldn't have won as convincingly, if not more so, under a typical season."
"The Lakers actually lost a starter in Avery Bradley, lost the momentum they were building from that weekend over the Bucks and Clippers, and lost homecourt advantage, and now you're saying they were the beneficiaries of the bubble??? Whut?"
"&gt; Luka Doncic is r/NBA’s golden boy. He can do no wrong. He takes 7 inefficient step-back threes a game, stat pads triple doubles, shoots tons of free throws and yells about foul calls. To r/NBA this makes him “a stud” and “built different.” They love him unconditionally. Meanwhile, James Harden plays this same style of basketball. Everything I just said to describe Luka’s play could be said about Harden equally. They must love him too, then… right? If you’re familiar with nbacirclejerk (which I assume you are if you’re reading this) then you might have an idea of what’s coming here. In my research I found a few recent (within the year) instances of r/NBA users claiming the Rockets could only beat teams using the refs. Going further back into the sub, there’s lots of people in game threads, post game threads, etc. calling Harden a “flopper” a “chucker” a “bitch” and a “choker.” I even found two comments that said “I hate [Harden] as a person.” (It’s odd to me how r/NBA seems to assume they know players on a personal level, but that’s a topic I’ve covered in previous posts.) Harden clearly gets different treatment from r/NBA than Doncic, despite the two of them playing eerily similar ways, and acting relatively the same in regards to foul calls. So what’s different between the two of them to cause this? Is it the team they play for? The Rockets don’t seem to be particularly well liked, but the Mavericks do recently. So that’s it, problem solved right? No. As one person in r/NBA puts it, “the Mavs didn’t have this many fans when Harrison Barnes was their best player.” r/NBA doesn’t have any deep spiritual connection with the Mavericks that causes them to love all their players. So why is Doncic so loved and Harden so hated? **Well, to be quite frank, Doncic is white**. It has to be said that r/NBA loves white players. The only example of a caucasian player being disliked in r/NBA that I could find in my research was Grayson Allen. People love players like Alex Caruso, and say he’s a top 20 shooting guard in the league, while his teammates who are also shooting guards are ignored or hated, like Avery Bradley and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope respectively. I would rank both of those players above Caruso in terms of talent and impact for the Lakers, but only one of those three players is given universal praise on r/NBA."
"Or that other Bradley, of the Avery kind, to add some D   In His last two Boston seasons form, that is, before he evolved into whatever he is now"
and Avery Bradley too
Remember the only way to make doc make lineup adjustments was to trade guys away? Cough Avery bradley
"Well obviously they’d rather have kept Harden, but they didn’t get complete dogshit like Victor Oladipo, who just turned into Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. It was an awful take, and I personally think it was slightly worse than the take OKC got."
Right I’m really gonna miss Avery Bradley.
That’s alot coming from a Rockets fan whose team is in deep shit and basically traded Harden for Olynyk and Avery Bradley
"I miss that 2016 team so much. IT, Smart, Jae, Avery Bradley, Olynyk, Horford, Jaylen Brown. That team had so much heart"
"Well instead they got Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, a bunch of middle schoolers and some shitty swaps they don’t even have full control over."
Avery Bradley
Pat Bev is the evil Avery Bradley
Honestly think team chemistry was the best with Avery Bradley and Isaiah Thomas squad. Then Irving's weird personality ruined their season and now Kemba Walker is no longer his old self after injury. Team is kinda heading in a wrong direction despite having two young stars Tatum and Brown. Smart and Timelord are also pretty good role players.
His 3rd year as coach they were a 5 seed at 48-34  His best players on that roster were:  \- Isiah Thomas (defensive sieve)  \- Avery Bradley  \- Jae Crowder  \- Evan Turner  \- Jared Sullinger  and Kelly Olynyk.  That would not be a playoff team with most coaches.
"&gt;Even with respect to in game management, I thought he got out-coached by Nick Nurse last year in the bubble against Toronto, but they just squeaked by in 7 games even though they were way more talented.  Toronto was:  * The higher seed * The healthier team  * The Vegas favourites to win * The ESPN favourites to win * On a hotter streak (they were entirely undefeated in the bubble outside of 1 regular season loss to Boston and 4 playoff losses to Boston)  Nurse losing a series he was supposed to win and then ending up in the lottery isn't him outcoaching Brad.    &gt;He has consistently had good talent to work with in Boston  He once made the playoffs with   * Brandon Bass * Jared Sullinger * Tyler Zeller * Evan Turner * Avery Bradley  As the 5 leading starters.   The Celtics team who took LeBron to 7 and became the 2nd most successful young team of all time...were predicted to win 37 games when Hayward initially got hurt.  ***  A lot of the criticisms towards Brad just come down to people forgetting his record or moving the goalposts retrospectively."
Can't tell if you're trolling/playing dumb. Players sat out because they wanted to minimize the risk of getting sick. One example: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29355391/lakers-avery-bradley-opts-nba-restart-cites-family-concerns%3fplatform=amp  Highly doubt they'd forfeit pay because they thought the games were illegitimate
Basing on you talking about Avery Bradley even though they won a championship with him at home
"&gt;Avery Bradley  Didnt even play in the bubble  &gt;McGee  Hardly got play time when it mattered  &gt;Dwight  Barely played when it mattered.   &gt;JR, Quinn or Dion  lmao"
"&gt;Dennis Schroeder is at worst a liability out there but at best a downgrade from Rondo and Avery.  Schröder is a huge upgrade from Rondo. Bradley didn’t play in the bubble.   &gt;They bloody gave up two certified trees of Dwight and McGee and now it’s Drummond and Gasol who aren’t all shabby but it’s still such a downgrade defensively.  McGee was closer to a traffic cone than a tree. Both played very sparingly in the playoffs.  &gt;Avery Bradley and Danny Green also gone?? All I’m seeing is THT who is a rookie?! Even JR, Quinn or Dion could have you given you quality playoff minutes.  You already mentioned Bradley. We signed Wes Matthews to replace Green."
" &gt;Dennis Schroeder is at worst a liability out there but at best a downgrade from Rondo and Avery.  Schröder has been inconsistent but has absolutely contributed more than Rondo or Bradley did combined.   &gt;Avery Bradley and Danny Green also gone?? All I’m seeing is THT who is a rookie?!  Wes Matthews who for the price is a great replacement.   &gt;Even JR, Quinn or Dion could have you given you quality playoff minutes.  ~~It's statements like this that make me wonder why we have this sub if people are simply going to post their r/NBA level posts here.~~ Well I'm glad you saw which sub this post belonged on.  Three guys that played a total of 23 combined NBA games this year would or should be getting minutes for the Lakers? That's laughable.  THT is a better players than those three currently are and he's not even that good."
"He’s not on Smart’s level defensively. Ben from ThinkingBasketball did a video on Smart and he has the highest impact on the defensive end of any guard.  I’d say Brooks is better offensively but Smart isn’t just a good individual defender, like Avery Bradley, he’s a great TEAM defender like Draymond, but I wouldn’t say as good"
"I mean, Ariza, RoCo, Wes Matthews, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Patrick Beverley, PJ Tucker... all guys who were pretty solid in both aspects in their primes (some of them still are), and I wouldn’t really call any of them “stars.” The only really “star” I think of when I hear the “3&amp;D” label is Klay Thompson.  Edit: I misunderstood what you were calling “overrated”; that’s my bad."
"Addition by subtraction. You have TOO many like-players. Even worse it’s a combo of young guys and vets. So the young guys will naturally defer to older guys, and/or the coach will lean on the reliable older guys, when really the young guys should get minutes and a chance to shine and make mistakes. So along those line…  Put the ball in Tyler Herro’s hands. In the modern game, yea, he can run point. Similar to Jamal Murray. And similar to Jamal Murray, remember just a few years ago when Gary Harris(and to a lesser extent Will Barton) were seen as interchangeable with Murray? Harris was more stable, older, but Murray had the upside. Denver finally took off when that was cleared up.   For the Heat they have like 2 or 3 ‘Gary Harris’ guys. Dragic, Nunn, even had Avery Bradley. They need to trim some good players and give Herro big minutes. He is their highest upside player. I refuse to believe it was just the bubble. I think it’s the glut of guards, him deferring a little, him playing off-ball, and the fame overwhelmed him   Lastly, trade Jimmy Butler. As someone else pointed out, he has value to a contender. This is your last chance to get value for him   In my best case scenario for Miami:  -Trade Jimmy Butler to Atlanta in sign and trade for John Collins    -Let Goran Dragic walk, or sign and trade to a desperate contender for a projected late 1st (Philly, LA, Bucks)  -Let Ariza walk  -Let Iggy walk   -Sign Nunn on a friendly deal but do NOT overpay. He’s not THAT good. Move him to 6th man   -Re-sign Oladipo. Prove it deal   2021-22 Lineup  Herro   Oladipo  Robinson   Collins    Bam  6th man- Nunn  -Pat Riley and thr city of miami will be enough to sign the remaining guys. Your lineup is thinner, but you have better hierarchy and pathways for 3 guys to become stars (herro, Collins, Bam)  That ‘5 guys who average 15 a game’ blueprint has never worked"
carried by lebron against the superteam of...avery bradley and jae crowder after IT couldn’t continue?? and kyrie dropped an average of 19 ppg? that series??
Only if Avery Bradley was still on the Lakers.
"Honestly besides Dedmon, our trade/moves just didn't work out. Oladipo obviously, but we signed Avery Bradley who played about as many games as Dipo did in a heat uniform. Harkless was horrible for us, and Ariza was decent not someone you want to be giving huge minutes to in the playoffs. Pair all that with Iggy and Dragic declining rapidly and we are just not a good team this year. I'm still willing to give Jimmy and Bam the benefit of the doubt, but its going to be a big off season for us this year."
Jae Crowder literally averaged 20 in the playoffs for the heat last season... and you mention Kelly O and Avery Bradley?
Did this nobody ever suit up? He was always heat adjacent. Avery Bradley gave it a legitimate shot and was actually trying to come back from injuries unlike this bum
"was stoked when avery bradley got traded -- 1 down, 1 to go. hopefully our FO doesn't resign him"
"Should have kept Olynyk, Harkless, &amp; Avery Bradley."
Avery Bradley
"Heat have a history of employing players with credible domestic violence accusations like Kendrick Nunn, Avery Bradley, and James Johnson, as well as notable dirty players like Olynyk and Dragic.  That is Heat Culture"
Avery Bradley +23 and 50% from 3 lmao
"And Boston fans. So now we’ve heard stories from Avery Bradley, Marcus Smart, and now Tristian Thompson. They keep saying “It’s not the sixties anymore!”. These are players that we watch TODAY that are saying that Celtics fans are being racist as fuck towards them. They need to own up to the racism and shittiness in their fanbase and change it"
The Heat could sure use Avery Bradley and Mo Harkless right now.
"All of their players from last year are playing worse, particularly Herro and Bam. The Heat traded Olynk and Avery Bradley for basically nothing (Oladipo). Ariza looked good towards the end of the season, but to me he's been washed for a couple years now. The fact that the Heat expected him and Iggy to play legimate minutes was misguided.   Then, the Bucks got way better. Eric Bledsoe is addition by subtraction. Having a guy like Jrue Holiday who's legitimately a top 10 point guard helps a lot. You can count on Forbes, Tucker, and Portis. Divencenzo and Connaughton are better. They don't even need to rely on Giannis to put up big numbers offensively. Finally, this Bucks defense is just crazy.    Still, talent-wise, this Heat team shouldn't be getting beat like this. Jimmy Butler and Bam are all-stars/All-NBA players. They can't get one game? If you watch them, they're playing with no grit or energy. No one on the court seems to give a fuck. Jimmy isn't yelling. Herro looks like he's straight out of college or something. There's something more to this somewhere. I bet we'll find out after they get swept."
"And like we traded Kelly and Avery Bradley for a star who won't be playing, and lost Jae Crowder the bossman. Why is no one calling the Lakers bubble frauds (they were playing equally garbage).  To make it clear I'm in no way making excuse for my team we playing dogshit basketball rn... But like frauds?"
People seem to forget Lakers also lost one of their best players in Avery Bradley and still rolled through every team.
"For reference: https://theundefeated.com/features/celtics-being-a-black-player-in-boston/  &gt; Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart was expecting a simple drive home after a game during the 2016-17 season when he encountered a vocal Celtics fan he will never forget. The woman was with a little boy in the middle of the crosswalk outside of TD Garden when the light turned green for oncoming traffic. Smart honked his horn to warn her. &gt;  &gt; “I yell out the window,” Smart recalled. “ ‘Excuse me, ma’am, you better get out of the street before you and your son get hit. Cars are coming. I don’t want you to get hit.’ &gt;  &gt; “As soon as I said that, she looked at me – as she is wearing a No. 4, green with the white outline Celtics jersey – and told me, ‘F— you, you f—ing n—–.’ People that actually heard her were stunned. They’re like, ‘That’s Marcus Smart. You just got done watching the game, ma’am … with an Isaiah Thomas jersey on.’ ”  ...  &gt; Avery Bradley, who played for the Celtics from 2010-2017, said one of his brothers had a racist incident at a Boston Bruins game. &gt;  &gt; “My family and friends experienced a lot of racism in Boston,” Bradley said. “If they weren’t with me, they experienced all types of stuff. At a hockey game, my brother almost got in a fight with some people because they were acting crazy. I never experienced it, but every other person I knew that was there experienced it.” &gt;  &gt; As Smart learned that night in his car outside of TD Garden, the difference can come down to street clothes versus game jersey. Former Celtics forward Glen Davis said Bostonians always gave him love and respect “because I wore the jersey of the Celtics,” but when he went out he occasionally heard racist words from fans. &gt;  &gt; “There were moments when you go out and a fan overdoes it,” Davis said. “For example … ‘Can you dunk, you big monkey?’ You would go out to the clubs, bars where some of the fans were drunk and would say things like that.”"

"Dame got hurt after the Blazers were down 0-3.  Westbrook wasn't injured and even if he was, people call him a negative player anyways.  Will Barton missed the entire playoffs. The Nuggets made the WCF without him.  You can argue the finals injuries sure. But the Lakers were heavy favorites before that series started and the injuries happened.   Moreover, a starter for the Lakers, Avery Bradley, didn't play at all in the bubble. Ad got injured during the finals. And the Lakers lost their homecourt advantage for the playoffs. The bubble hurt the Lakers more than any other team."
Reminds me of Avery Bradley. These guys have short peaks but are so fun to watch play D
"It was a pretty strong move to go against Lebron in the same arena imo, it made things super exciting, the whole dynamic duos narrative for the season and the game they played against the Clippers right before the shutdown last year was awesome(Avery Bradley hit 6 3s that game lol). I dont think he leaves, i think he gets his money and allows them to build around him."
This is one I’m surprised isn’t getting brought up more. Heat dropped two key playoff rotation pieces in Kelly Olynk and Avery Bradley and plugged the hole with..nothing (Injured Oladipo)
"robert williams is still with us and just had 9 blocks in a playoff game, and avery bradley was a top tier role player with us and fell off for a bit when he left"
IT and Avery Bradley won multiple series together
IT and Avery Bradley were pretty small
I would compare him more to Avery Bradley but I think you're not far off
"You're definitely going to miss having Danny, but your guard defense is still pretty solid. Caruso and KCP definitely stepped up to the plate when you lost Avery Bradley. I also think Booker can be gameplanned out of any significant impact. He's an amazingly talented scorer, but he's never had to go against a defense that had the time and motivation to study him and devise a plan to stop him. Regular season scoring doesn't guarantee playoff success.   Of course I could be very wrong about him and he'll shine regardless of what your D throws at him, but otherwise it's still a learning experience.   CP3 can't be stopped by anyone though. As long as he doesn't get injured, he'll get his and exert his dominance.  Regardless, I hope it's a great series. Usually the first round isn't that interesting because close matchups tend to be between teams I don't give two shits about instead of LeBron vs CP3"

"what would a team have to do to break this cycle?  Would they have to turn over literally the entire roster in free-agency in one off-season?

That takes you all the way back to 1949, before that the Celtics were in the BAA but we could keep going.  I don't think this is as uniques as you think it is..."
Bro the fact that im 2017 without Isaiah they even took a game (shoutout Avery Bradley) against the cavs is insane Brad Stevens is a good coach front office just needs to idk do something
Are you implying that having Avery Bradley as the best player on the opposing ECF team makes for an easy path to the finals? The disrespect
1) They are the only team in nba history who didn't get the benefit of homecourt advantage that they had earned.  2) They were the last team to find out who they would play in the 1st round because of the West play-in for the 8th seed. Even the teams fighting for the 8th seed knew they would play the Lakers if they won.  3) They lost a starter (Avery Bradley) specifically because of the bubble.  4) The 8th seed they faced was a fake 8 seed and actually a 4-6 seed that was allowed to get healthy at the end of the season because of the season's suspension.  5) They were never allowed to leave their hotel rooms. Most of them in living spaces they don't fit in which is basically like being on the road.
"Or is it just doing KCP vs Steph? KCP used to defend him pretty well on the Pistons. He still went off sometimes but KCP was super adept at slipping by screens back then, and held his own. He looked like prime Avery Bradley at times."
Definitely not. Avery Bradley lost out on All Defense because a journalist said Booker scored 70 on Bradley. Bradley didn’t play that game.
"They got fleeced in every trade they made. They effectively traded Harden for Avery Bradley, Olynyk, and shit picks. Rockets now have the worst ownership and FO in the league."
No lol it was low risk we gave up Olynyk who wasn’t playing that well with us and was a free agent and Avery Bradley who couldn’t stay healthy on the heat
Yeah.  Kelly O is playing out of his mind and would fit with a lot and I mean a lot of teams. He’s just a good player and has an incentive to play better because of his contract which could’ve been big for them in the playoffs.  I’m not trying to be like “I told you so” but just based on his play in Houston everyone should’ve known dude just isn’t that good if at all anymore. I wanted the pacers to trade him before the bubble even began.  Avery Bradley even though he barely played is still a legit rotation guy you can go to if someone else is hurt or out or not playing well.
"Hes very good at it. Absolutely hate guys just running into people in the lane, its horseshit and should be an offensive every time you lower your shoulder. The league thinks fans want to see 130-128 games so they made it so basically cant play defense. Thats why watching guys like avery bradley play man defense and stay in front of people is so fucking impressive"
"nah it’s been for like 3 years since the “Jrue is super underrated” era (especially after that Blazers series and his first all-defense team selection). Once Avery Bradley, Smart, Butler, Roberson, etc either got old, hurt, or took a step back on defense he rose to the top 2 of the discussion amongst fans. Jrue being an elite defender isn’t something fans realized this season."
"The real problem is his defense. If you're a point guard, you can get by with poor shooting with Lebron as long as you can contribute on the defensive end (see: Avery Bradley, Caruso, and Rondo). Once Schroeder stopped putting up buckets due to time away or yipps from carrying a Lakers team, he was useless next to Lebron."
"Every round the Lakers played was without starting point guard Avery Bradley, and they were also missing Rondo for the entire first round. How lucky for the Lakers."
"&gt;Dame hurt in R1  I appreciate that you note that none of these injuries really tilted things from against the Lakers to the series suddenly being in their favor. [The Dame injury](https://youtu.be/4DbQEeSmEL8) in particular was really irrelevant, as he got hurt in the second half of Game 4, when the Lakers were already up 2-1 in the series, and at the time of Dame's injury the Lakers were up 92-56 in the game. Lillard stayed in the game for two more minutes, and when he exited for good the score was 96-66, so I don't think if Dame stays healthy the Blazers win that game, meaning they'd have been down 3-1. The Blazers ended up losing that game by 20, after losing Game 2 by 23, so that wasn't a particularly close matchup even before the Lillard injury.   It's also important to note that Avery Bradley did not go to the bubble with the Lakers, Rondo missed the whole first round with a broken finger, and Danny Green played most of the playoffs with a hip injury, which really affected his offense, so it's not like the Lakers had no injuries or absences of their own to worry about."
Avery Bradley?
Avery Bradley
Holiday is a glorified Avery Bradley
"I thought the same thing about the Harden deal, then they trade him for a few picks + assets they flipped for Oladipo, who they flipped for... Avery Bradley &amp; Kelly Olynyk.  Portland would be thrilled to receive a young star such as Ingram given that they have 0 leverage here."
"And it was crazy because we really didn't have any other options.   Isaiah was the only player on our roster who could dribble **and** shoot at a decent level. Everyone else on the roster could only do one or the other.   Marcus could handle the ball but was having a historically bad shooting season, Avery could shoot but he's a 6'2 SG because he has zero handles, etc etc.  We had decent players, but there was no Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum or even a Lou Williams that Isaiah could share those late-game responsibilities with.  Plus he had a huge target on his back because of the KOT4 stuff.  So when the game slowed down in the clutch entire defenses would just zero in on Isaiah. Teams knew they only had to slow this one guy down for a short specific stretch.  He obliterated them game after game.   It was absurd how consistently he did it too, it was like clockwork. He would sub in with 8 minutes left and 12-15 points on the board, he'd finish the game with 30."
"Sometimes I don’t understand the defenses he put together. It was guys like Avery Bradley, Crowder, Smart, and a bunch of rotation guys just flying around the court."
"Lebrons playmaking cant be limited by kawhi as much as you think, hes a much more cerebral player than he was in 2014, edge lebron. Pascal is too small to contain AD, Gasol too slow AD would cook them in the midrange like he did all thru the 2020 playoffs. Lowry &amp; FVV id rather have playoff Rondo and Avery Bradley tbqh"
By far the most overhyped prospect of this year draft.. just because Warriors in win now every mock wants them to take this Avery Bradley 2.0 at 7
"If you want to include minor absences, then say that Avery Bradley missed the whole playoffs, Rondo missed the first round and AD got injured at the end of game 5 in the finals. And you’re reaching when you’re including House/Dame absences when those series were already over at that point. Also, even if everything you said was true it wouldn’t even come close to equating the benefits the Suns got this year, which was your original comparison that I responded to. Come on, stay focused and pay attention."
Shades of Chris Broussard not giving Avery Bradley the All-D nod because Booker scored 70 in a game he was out.
I don’t know because the Clippers were getting pretty hot before COVID and it was kinda obvious most of them didn’t want to play in the bubble. But yea it was between either LA team to make the finals because I just remembered the Lakers were missing Avery Bradley in the bubble.
I hate how random people can just have the right to vote for all nba or all star when they probably don't even watch the games. I remember when Chris Broussard left out Avery Bradley from all defense voting because he thought Booker dropped 70 on him that game.. but Bradley didn't even play.
"The Rockets trading James Harden for washed Victor Oladipo, who they ended trading for fucking Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk, is definitely up there. It’s unbelievable that Harden was part of two of the worst trades in NBA history less than ten years apart."
"The Rockets trading James Harden for washed Bictor Oladipo, who they ended trading for fucking Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynyk, is definitely up there. It’s unbelievable that Harden was part of two of the worst trades in NBA history less than ten years apart."
Avery Bradley for the 1st pick straight up final offer
"Last year's title winning team had more shooting than this year's iteration did.   KCP, Danny Green, and Avery Bradley are all players who have shot a high % from 3 and all have ""gravity,"" they're going to be guarded at the 3-point line. You could put those 3 around LeBron and AD and that would be a great offense.  2 of those guys are now gone. Schroder sucks as a 3-point shooter outside of one outlier season with OKC. Who are the above average 3-point shooters on this roster besides KCP who are not absolute turnstiles on defense (looking at you McLemore...)."
Man do I miss crowder. We literally let him walk for fucking Avery Bradley lmaoooo
"Okay so they now have defensive coaching, as I assumed against from the out of context stats. I thought Nate was the coach for the entire year, so my bad. Back to my original point. John Collins is a part of this defensive improvement right? Or is he slowing it down? Does he not have the potential to be a better perimeter defender with the better coaching staff over time? Or is that all just a highlight reel thing im doing and watching him block a shot or two with no real basis for that assumption?  I assume you’ve hooped too so you know that getting blown by sometimes isn’t bad defense? And all the other little nuances of good defensive games? Again, all under the impression you know better than I do, and i’ll go about this discussion with that assumption. How is my original statement not valid of him being a big that — CAN POSSIBLY defend the perimeter (better than most other big men) with EVEN LESS, BUT POSSIBLY MORE (again, he is not great at this, but has better potential and has shown more flashes of) playmaking ability with an EASILY IMPROVABLE (meaning something that is not perfect, but a part of his game enough that it is a threat) jumper that can tie into all this improvement within the next year. I got some stats wrong, but he is in fact improved as a defender over time has he not? And can he not further improve given his athletic ability and the fact he is only in his 3rd year?  Im a laker fan that lives in phoenix and spend a majority of my time watching those teams. His defense, like Kuzma’s, has improved over a few years. I watched this seasons hawks games after some of the injuries died down and saw a lot of young-player flashes of potential from Collins, and when i say that i mean all he lacks is consistency pure isolation d. And he fouled a lil bit too much here and there before but this season seems to be better. Pure athleticism is my argument for him being able to guard out and help defense, not one on one staying in front of the ball on an iso. There are HARDLY any great iso defenders with the likes of Kawhi, Mikal Bridges, Avery Bradley, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy and others like them. Those defenders are rare, and often are the best players in the league. I think my comment got mistaken given the definitive relativity of “average” in my own head.   I was wrong about the stats, but im basing a lot of what I said on the ABILITY he has rather than the CONSISTENCY he has done it with. And hes done some of these things more than once so its not crazy to think he’ll be a better defender and better shooter as time goes on. I think Nate can give him the ball and let him work more once next season rolls around and create deliberate passing actions off of that ability. Like i said, it doesn’t take much with a player of his standard to make good passes as defenses will have to collapse on him and trae, and especially with having trae, bogdan, hunter, and huerter on offense he’ll have a much easier time doing those things and it is worth keeping him for those reasons. He has a reasonable ceiling."
"Isaiah Thomas and Rondo for the Celtics. We also have love for guys like Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk."
I think he was drafted at the one and split his few seasons behind Isaiah and avery Bradley
"I noticed this when he got lit up by Derrick Rose on the Pistons two years ago, he just couldn't cope with his deceleration. We generally struggle with that guard profile more than most, I feel. From Jamal Murray to Spencer Dinwiddie. I'm not sure it's a new problem for him or it's always been the case. We used to have Avery Bradley then Rozier as the primary on those match ups, maybe it's always been the case."
"Don't forget about losing our important 3 and D player Avery Bradley the whole playoffs - I think that was the worst, I don't remember who else lost a player as important going in, tho"
"Yep, like a Patty Mills or Avery Bradley to back up Smart."
"76ers could have given just as many draft picks with better young players like Thybulle and Simmons. They could have flipped Simmons and Thybulle for more picks too. All-defense players have value even if they don't want to shoot the ball.   Even if they thought that Nets had a better deal, you can get more from Jarett Allen than just a single FRP. They also opted not to take Caris LeVert, opting to get Oladipo in the trade instead while sending a 2nd rounder to Pacers. And what did they get back for Oladipo? Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and a pick swap?   Just take a page from Sam Presti on how to get picks from teams."
I believe it was Chris Broussard who said the Avery Bradley wasn’t a good defender because Booker scored 70 on the Celtics. Foot note: Bradley was not playing that night.
Chris Broussard left Avery Bradley off the All-Defense team because of Booker’s crazy game  Avery Bradley didn’t play in that game
"Hey when such a bad defensive player like Avery Bradley is guarding you, anyone can go for 70."
"Yes i’m sure that trade completely kills their depth by losing Wiggins and a player they benched several times to win games along with 2 rookies, one being the last pick of the lottery. Curry is 33 and are in full win now mode, they would certainly take an all nba 30 PPG scorer and Avery Bradley over two completely unproven rookies with the 7th and 14th picks in the draft. If that trade were to happen the Warriors would still have 13 players on their roster and that’s assuming they wouldn’t make any other moves. That’s what you do when you need to add another star player to compete again."
"&gt; Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021 &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Yeah, no."
"oh shit i tripped   protip firefox has built in functionality that can get around some paywalls   espn.com Six big trades we want to see at this year's draft NBA Insiders 11-14 minutes  Could NBA stars, including Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook and Bradley Beal, be traded in the days before, or immediately after, the July 29th NBA draft? Which first-round picks could be on the table?  Some NBA teams are looking to locate one final player who could push them into prime contention. Some are looking to get younger with an eye toward long-term relevancy. And others still have financial considerations that necessitate alterations to the roster.  With that in mind, our NBA experts provided six trades that would work, including multiple All-Stars and upcoming first-round selections changing uniforms. Simmons out, Love in for Sixers  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Jonathan Givony: Simmons' trade value hit rock bottom after a dismal playoff campaign in which he was a complete nonfactor late in games due to his passivity and historic struggles at the free throw line. Moving to Cleveland would give him a fresh start outside of the spotlight where he could hopefully rediscover his offensive game and use his versatility as a passer and defender to put the Cavs back in the playoffs after a three-year drought. This trade would open some possibilities in the draft for Cleveland, allowing the Cavs to more seriously explore the candidacy of Jalen Suggs, who could be an interesting fit alongside promising 21-year old Darius Garland. Jalen Green would also be an intriguing option for the Cavs, if Houston decides to pass on him at No. 2.  Philadelphia would balance and modernize its roster with Sexton, a 22-year-old, 24-point per game scorer who has shot 39% from beyond the arc in his NBA career and has improved considerably in each of his three seasons thus far. The Sixers would also add Love, a former NBA champion who would bring the type of floor spacing, dynamic passing and experience they sorely lacked in the frontcourt while playing behind and occasionally alongside Joel Embiid. While injury prone, Love has just two years remaining on his contract and should be able to rebuild his standing in NBA circles with a productive showing at the Olympics, where he'll likely be asked to play a role as one of only two traditional big men on the roster alongside Bam Adebayo. Young to aide the Nets' title efforts  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Bobby Marks: The Nets enter the offseason with limited options on how to improve their roster beyond their own free agents. Signing and trading Dinwiddie (starting salary of $18 million) would help balance their roster. With the trade for James Harden, Dinwiddie is an expensive insurance policy off the Nets' bench. If Brooklyn signed him outright, its luxury tax bill increases from $40 million to $114 million, and the high cost is before factoring in restricted free agent Bruce Brown and using the $5.9 million tax midlevel exception.  The addition of Young gives Brooklyn much-needed depth at power forward and center, given that Jeff Green and Blake Griffin are both unrestricted free agents this offseason. Moving off of the Jordan contract (two years, $20 million) would offset the $14.9 million owed to Young. The Nets would also create a $9.9 million trade exception.  Point guard is a position of need for Chicago and because the Bulls do not have cap space, they will need to orchestrate a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Dinwiddie. The addition of Brooklyn's selection now has Oklahoma CIty with four first-round picks on July 29. The Thunder will acquire Jordan with the $10.1 million trade exception created in the trade of Danilo Gallinari to Atlanta last year.  Note: Because of salary-cap rules, this trade cannot be completed until Aug. 6. Gilgeous-Alexander goes home to Toronto  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Kevin Pelton: After a disappointing outcome in the draft lottery, could Oklahoma City decide to pivot toward a slower rebuild? As exciting a player as Gilgeous-Alexander is, he won't quite fit the timeline of whatever stars the Thunder add in the lottery over the next few years. By trading him for the Raptors' pick, Oklahoma City would sacrifice the certainty of Gilgeous-Alexander's future in exchange for more cap flexibility and the potential of a draft prospect they like.  From the Raptors' standpoint, Gilgeous-Alexander would be a terrific fit as a replacement for Kyle Lowry in the backcourt next to Fred VanVleet. At 23 in July, Gilgeous-Alexander matches up with the timeline of a team with VanVleet and Pascal Siakam (both 27) and OG Anunoby (24) as young building blocks. And it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring home a Toronto native as the Raptors prepare to return to Canada.  To make this trade legal before August, Toronto would need to guarantee $3.08 million of Baynes' non-guaranteed 2021-22 salary. That would surely be preferable for the Raptors than either waiting a month after signing the No. 4 pick to utilize his matching salary, and the Thunder might not easily get to the salary floor. Beal, Wiseman, Wiggins change addresses  Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins  Mike Schmitz: For the Warriors, landing one of the league's most prolific scorers in Beal to pair with 33-year-old Stephen Curry and 31-year-olds Klay Thompson and Draymond Green would be a dream scenario. Golden State would have over $140 million committed to that quartet next season, but Beal is the ideal star to catapult this Warriors group back into NBA Finals contention. While Wiseman did show impressive flashes during the early stages of his rookie season, at just 20 years old, he and whomever the Warriors would select at Nos. 7 and 14 are likely on a different timeline than the current Golden State core.  With Beal technically able to walk in free agency after the 2021-22 season, it's imperative that the Wizards add either young players with star potential or a high draft pick who could turn into a franchise cornerstone. The Wizards would get exactly that with the No. 2 overall pick, giving them the option to choose from Jalen Green, Evan Mobley or Jalen Suggs, assuming Cade Cunningham is indeed the first overall selection. Green would make a lot of sense for the Wizards, as he holds real star potential, regularly earning comparisons to some combination of Zach LaVine and Beal. The Wizards also hold the 15th overall pick, which could yield a starter-caliber player in what's considered a very deep draft.  For the Rockets, giving up the chance to draft Green, Mobley or Suggs would be tough to do, especially when you consider the fact that Houston traditionally hasn't coveted centers like Wiseman. Still, Wiseman showed enough promise as a rim-runner, lob-catcher and floor-spacer to carve out a long, successful career as a franchise center, and could fit in two-big lineups with stretch big Christian Wood in the interim. With Houston far from win-now mode, the change of scenery would give Wiseman a chance to develop at his own pace. Landing the seventh and 14th overall picks from Golden State would also give Houston four picks in the top 25, giving the Rockets quite a bit of flexibility and ammo. The Rockets could still land a point guard of the future such as Davion Mitchell at No. 7 and a potential starter with upside at 14. Pelicans find new core for Zion  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick"
"It's because it was out in the open, he took the heat for what he did, the trial was huge and he had to apologize and make changes because of it. As far as we've seen, maybe this has changed recently, Chauncey hasn't acknowledged this previously or apologized publicly or done stuff to make up for it. Then again, he wasn't guilty so there may be nothing to apologize for. Its just hard to compare the two situations. Avery Bradley would probably be a better comp."
"Trade 1:   Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons  Philadelphia 76ers receive: Collin Sexton, Kevin Love, top-10 protected 2022 first rounder  Trade 2:  Chicago Bulls receive: Spencer Dinwiddie (sign-and-trade deal)  Brooklyn Nets receive: Thaddeus Young and 2026 second from OKC (protected 31-55)  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: DeAndre Jordan and 2021 Brooklyn first (No. 27)  Trade 3:  Oklahoma City Thunder receive: No. 4 pick, Aron Baynes  Toronto Raptors receive: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Trade 4:   Golden State Warriors receive: Bradley Beal, Avery Bradley  Houston Rockets receive: James Wiseman, No. 7 pick in 2021, No. 14 pick in 2021  Washington Wizards receive: No. 2 pick in 2021, Andrew Wiggins   Trade 5:  New Orleans Pelicans receive: Myles Turner, Larry Nance Jr., Sexton, Love  Indiana Pacers receive: Steven Adams, No. 10 pick  Cleveland Cavaliers receive: Brandon Ingram, Eric Bledsoe"

Yeah last season should get an asterisk. We lost Avery Bradley due to the bubble and had to play with no HCA
"Avery Bradley was easily our best guard defender that season, he was a huge miss to our already insane defense."
Because the Lakers were the ones who lost homecourt advantage because of the bubble. They started the bubble without Avery Bradley who was a starter.  The Blazers were down 2-1 and down nearly 30 points in Game 4 about to go down 3-1 when Lillard got hurt. Plus the season suspension allowed them to get Nurkic back from a season ending injury for the playoffs.  &gt; Also the injuries and Draymond’s suspension to the 2016 Warriors  Just like Kevin Love's injury in that finals.
"How does the 2020 Lakers playing in a bubble count as lucky? If anything, that’s bad luck for the Lakers because they should’ve had homecourt throughout.   Plus, as others have pointed out, Avery Bradley was a key part of that team and didn’t play in the bubble, so I’d say that at least cancels out Will Barton.  Also, the fact that the Lakers won in 5 against the Blazers and Nuggets makes people less concerned about the injuries to Lillard and Barton (lol)."
[And Avery Bradley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m96EyVduAjQ)  I guess Celtics players like behind the backboard shots
"I remember a time when “Butler, Shumpert or Avery Bradley?” was at least a conversation lol"
"I was just wondering who could possibly be the last person Shaq played with that could keep the streak going after this season, strangely enough it is probably LeBron. But Avery Bradley was the youngest player he played with as far as I can see born in 1990.   The only possible people would be Rondo, Robin Lopez, Jeff Green and Dragic. Everyone else I think is out of the league. Only other person would be Wade if he unretired, but that ain't happening."
Also Avery Bradley didn't come to the bubble at all because his child has a respiratory disorder.
"Really?  KD with prime Wade and Bosh doesn't win 2 rings?  KD with prime AD cant beat the Heat without Dragic and a hobbled Bam?  Really?  KD with Kyrie and Love cant beat the IT less Celtics, whose leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder lol.  KD with just Love cant beat a Kyrie less Celtics team led by 20 year old Jaylen and 19 year old Tatum?  Prime KD with prime Wade and Bosh cant beat 22 year old Paul George and David West, Hibbert, Lance and George Hill?  Really?  Prime KD with prime Wade and Bosh cant beat 22 yo D Rose with Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah?   KD with an almost useless Harden who literally couldn't run and a bunch of role players was a half an inch away from single handedly beating a team with a 2x MVP plus 2 other all- stars.   2007 Detroit is the only time Lebron ever won a series when his team was even close to that under-talented (is this a word? i dk how to phrase it.  basically the gap between his talent and the other team).   And Milwaukee is better than that team (Chauncey, Rip, Tayshaun with no Ben Wallace and 32 year old Rasheed).  KD wouldn't win 2016, but he likely wins 2011 so those cancel out.  I think is is absurd that you don't think KD has any titles if he played Lebron's career out."
"TLDR: Basically the finals streak is when Lebron became Lebron and zoomed past other all timers to #2 on the all time list and some even think #1 (lol). This is when the ""he can drag anyone to the finals"" type arguments started.  But I wonder when this actually happened b/c in almost all of his series wins, he usually had a teammate or two who was better than the other teams best player.  So when you analyze his supporting casts compared to the teams he faced, I think you can make the case that there are a lot of other all timers who would've had a similar runs (10 finals, 4 titles) if they played Lebron's career out.   KD, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan, Bird, Magic etc.  They would likely make all of those finals except 2007 and win 4 (2011 Dallas swaps with 2016 GSW so still 4).  KD is early teens all-time on most lists.  But I think he would have 4 titles and 9 finals appearances if you swap him with Lebron.  So really the 2007 Detroit Series and the 2016 GSW series is the difference between Lebron being at the top/ in the discussion with those other guys 2-12 or whatever all time and just being automatically, unanimously put ahead of them at #2 without any thought at all.     A huge piece of Lebron's legacy is the finals streak.  You always hear ""Lebron dragged worse teams to the finals"" or ""lebron could drag any team to the finals"" etc etc.   But most of the finals runs, his team was way better than anyone he beat along the way.  It just worked out for him that when his team wasn't what you would expect to be talented enough to make the finals (2017 and 2018), they basically didn't face anyone.  Exception being 2007 when they beat 1 good team in Detroit.  Which is very impressive, but its also 1 series in 10 finals appearances.   IT got hurt in 2017 and Boston's leading scorers were Avery Bradley and Jae Crowder and Lebron had Kyrie and Love lmao.  Then Kyrie got hurt in 2018 and Boston's leading scorers were 20 year old Jaylen Brown (not close to what he is now) and rookie 19 year old Tatum.  And Kyrie was hurt, but Cleveland still had Love.  Forget teams, who are the best players Lebron had to go thru to get to the finals?  Everyone knows stars win playoff series.   Most of the stars he beat were either really young (D Rose 22, PG 22,23) or really old (Celtics Big 3 was 35).   Its just a bunch of borderline ""stars"" like Derozen, Lowrey, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, David West, Luol Deng. I'm sure I'm missing some, but its a pretty weak cast.  Basically, how many series has Lebron ever won where his supporting cast was actually worse than the other team's best players supporting cast?  2, maybe 3?  To compare, KD went nuts, but Brooklyn lost because he had to face a 2x MVP with 2 other all- stars.  Luka went nuts and they lost b/c he played a 2x champ and top 3 guy in the league in Kawhi plus prime PG and a good supporting cast (compared to 22 year old PG with David West, Hibbert, Lance etc but Lebron had Wade and Bosh).   Trae went nuts and beat Philly.  Embiid is way better than anyone Lebron ever beat in the East. and Philly is better than almost all the teams he ever beat.   Joker went nuts, but ran into a team who had 3 guys who are better than his 2nd best guy.  Dame went nuts, but he faced the league MVP.  This is all just this year.  The point is, a lot of stars have had great playoff series and lost, so nobody gives them credit or remembers them for ""dragging a less talented roster"" b/c they ran into great players/ teams.  Lebron just lucked out that when his team was sub-par, the competition was bad.  And when he won, his team was significantly more talented.  How many playoff series has Lebron ever won since he went to miami where his teammate wasn't the best player in the series (other than him)?  A lot of times he had the 2 best players.  Miami he had the 2 best guys in every series other than Chicago with Rose.  15 and 16 with Cleveland every series until the finals he had the 2 best guys in most of those series (prime love is better than Derozen, Horford etc).  Lakers nobody yet (AD best non bron player).   So 2007 Detroit is like the only series Lebron won en route to the finals where his teammate wasn't the best player other than him in the series.  And most of those he had the 2 best guys too."
"The Bucks didn’t even really bother to hunt mismatches during the first two games. Looked like they were just running their offense essentially. I think if the Hawks had to play team like a healthy Nets or Lakers team (maybe Phoenix too if the Hawks make the finals) we would see it exploited a lot more. Both because they have better iso players than the Bucks/Sixers/Knicks but they’re just in general smarter teams with guys who press the advantage and will continue to press it in CP3/Harden/Lebron. Hell I remember a reg season Lakers game vs the Bucks last year I believe where they did a curl play for Avery Bradley at the top of key, they legitimately ran that play must’ve been 6 straight times because the Bucks didn’t adjust and the Lakers wanted to take advantage. I haven’t seen anything close to that utilized vs the Hawks by any of the teams they’ve faced and the Bucks seem happy to just run their offense mostly as normal so I don’t expect that to change unless they make the finals."
"&gt; Tbf Saddiq Bey looks way better than your typical #19 pick  actually not as it turns out lmfao. 19 is the most loaded non lotto pick spot this decade somehow. Huerter, Collins, Tobias and Gary Harris, Malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley all 19th overall lmao.  Bey is a gem though, Detroit has a bright future."
Avery Bradley 1990
"Just looking at the C's 2010 roster, looks like Avery Bradley is the youngest guy still playing."
"Tbf it was Bey and he was literally a first team rookie. Hell half the last 19th picks in the last decade are prolly better picks than bagley. Huerter, Collins, Tobias Harris, Gary Harris, malik Beasley, and Avery Bradley."
"The Jalen Brunson - Luke Ridnour comparison is a random one but it seems very accurate to me.  The Donovan Mitchell pre-draft comparisons (Avery Bradley, Gary Harris, etc) look silly because we now know how good he is offensively as a ball handler and pull up shooter.  Generally most 3 and D prospects have pretty accurate comparisons. OG Anunoby, Mikal Bridges, etc. are pretty much who we thought they'd be in terms of play style."
"There was nothing wrong with what happened. Most players wanted to play and those who didn’t chose not to. Also Avery Bradley was a prominent guy who was advocating for the players sitting out, that’s why I mentioned him. Did you read the article ?"
"Avery Bradley sat out due to the health concerns of his son, not for the same as why Kyrie sat out. so that’s a bad example anyway.    And that would’ve robbed the teams and players who actually wanted to compete for a title and their full salaries the opportunity to do so.   I see no problem with letting the players who wanted to play, play — and giving everyone the option to sit out. No one was forced to play."
Players like Avery Bradley had the choice of opting out which he utilized.
What about Avery Bradley ? He wasn’t the only guy who didn’t want to play.
"Yeah he sucks compared to *checks notes*  Dante Exum, Rodions Kuruks, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk  4 first round picks and 5 pick swaps with contenders.   You suck Ben!"
"&gt;I said he can't get too much credit for getting a player right in the top 3  Why cant he? He absolutely nailed those picks in a way  no other team (besides Cleveland) with 2 top 3 picks has. How many teams have absolutely whiffed on top 3 picks? And neither of those picks were obvious choices either. Brown especially was considered a reach and Ainge was heavily criticized for that pick.   And the reason I brought those up was because he said that Massai wasnt Ainge when it came to draft picks. You can criticize Ainge for his drafting, but hes nailed the top of the draft in ways few people have.   If you want later picks we got:  Terry Rozier Timelord  Pritchard  Tony Allen Gerald Green Avery Bradley"
"I still think he deserves credit, I mean the sixers ended up with Fultz and The Man with No Jumper lmao. Not to mention Ainge also drafted Scary Terry, Avery Bradley, and Timelord"
"Yeah he’s a terrible GM. Selecting trash players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, etc.  What a stupid comment"
"It took Doc like 4 months to start SGA, he would start Avery Bradley and Bev over him."
"Yeah, Horford really hated it here. Also KG, IT, the Truth, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner... I could go on and on with the list of ex-Celtics who just *hate* Boston."
The SGA we all know and love only happened because the Clipper's front office traded away Avery Bradley and forced doc to play SGA.
He didn't - it took for Avery Bradley to get injured for him too.
"Nope, hurt the Lakers more than anyone else. Home crowd would've been insane and our offense was ramping up before the shut down. Losing Avery Bradley lost a bit of our offensive dynamic that wasn't replaced"
"I don't know, I still would've taken Simmons. We would've gotten some picks reportedly too. All those firsts could be late. Levert eventually became Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley. Kurucs became DJ Wilson and DJ Augustin. To me it feels like we might end up with a whole lot of nothing for Harden.  Simmons value also wouldn't have plunged so much with us. There wouldn't have been the opportunity for him to shrink in a big moment. We could've flipped him for more assets."
"Take Avery Bradley off your list. Check out [these](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2718131-damian-lillard-other-nba-stars-slam-avery-bradleys-defensive-team-snub) reactions from Dame, CJ, and others. Players know WAY more about good defenders than writers, and certainly any of us. Especially those two because he would have been guarding them and back then they were arguably the best guard duo in the league.  Also [this](https://twitter.com/CJMcCollum/status/716107313891778560) tweet from CJ, and Dame has been quoted as saying he told AB he was the ""best perimeter defender"" in the league.  And don't forget about this [clutch defense](https://streamable.com/bcy74) on Kyrie to seal a win, that's about as well as you can hope to defend Ky. He was in his bag.  Avery Bradley had the reputation because he earned it"
Kawhi post 2017  Beverley  Avery Bradley  Rondo  Russ  PG post shoulder injuries  Covington to an extent (some people still think he is good on ball)  Brogdon   Bledsoe  Ayton was underrated but now people act like he is a great defender because he was good on Jokic and AD : he is an elite post defender/one on one defender but still just ok as a help defender  Steven Adams
"We could have had Curry and all those guys. Curry (4yr/$32m) would have taken the place of Avery Bradley (2yr/$10m) and Quinn Cook (2yr/$6m), neither of whom contributed to our playoff run."
"Yep he got a ring, but isn’t recognized as an NBA champion. Only players who play in the playoffs and win the title are considered champions. See Avery Bradley, he was a huge part of that Lakers regular season run, but isn’t a champion since he declined to play in the bubble."
"I believe the NBA defines an NBA champion as someone who played in the playoffs and won a ring with the team. So you guys on both sides are right... he DOES have a ring, but he’s not considered a champion as he didn’t play in the playoffs. Another example would be Avery Bradley, he played in the regular season but declined to play in the bubble playoffs. He has a ring too but is also not considered a champion."
"As of this moment the Harden deal looks like this:  Houston gave away:  Harden  PJ Tucker  2021 2nd round pick  Houston got:  5 unprotected first round picks   4 unprotected pick swaps   1 protected pick swap   Kelly Olynyk  Avery Bradley  DJ Augustin  The maximum the Sixers could have offered in picks would have been 3 first round picks (2021, 2023, and 2027) and one pick swap pick (2022).  Would any team now trade 2 unprotected picks and 3 unprotected pick swaps (plus cap flexibility) for Simmons? Cause that's what the Rockets chose instead of Simmons (and Thybulle I guess)."
Celtics made it in 11-12 and then 16-17 but Avery Bradley was on both teams.
PBev can be likable like Avery Bradley if he didn't have his antics... .dude is a hound dog! Playing great so far and with the right attitude
"56 win team in 2011. 3rd in East.  40 wins before 20 losses.  Rondo, Ray Allen, Pierce, KG, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley.  Still a legit team.  2012 they weren’t as great but only 7 losses more than the Heat. They were playoff built. Still a contender in my view"
"bro how can you include Avery Bradley as an excuse when's he out of the league...  just hold the L and move on.  Injuries happen. The Mickey Mouse ring helped you last year plus all those injuries. The suns have had luck with injuries no doubt but at least its not a Disney ring and its still less injuries than y'all dealt with in the bubble. Hold the L, move on, and cope. Suns win in 6 regardless and you know it. Your role players were absolutely terrible. Keep crying tho. Go ahead and brag about 17 rings!!! done replying to a dude who clearly doesn't understand basketball and has to make excuses for everything. Lakers will never win a real ring with LeBron. But hey enjoy that bubble ring. Nobody respects it but enjoy it!!! byeeeeeee enjoy the block LITTLE bud"
"The thing is my logic applies to all those series' as well.  Blazers: I could be missing something but I'm pretty confident Nurkic did play that series. No Collins, Ariza and an injured Lillard obviously hurt the Blazers. However, we were missing Rondo and Avery Bradley. Both teams 100% we're winning that series easily.  Rockets: Russ was absolutely hurt and House was very horny. And again, we were missing Avery Bradley. Both teams 100% Lakers win again. Maybe not in 5, though. Let's be honest Russ isn't exactly known as being an elite playoff performer.   Nuggets: No Barton for them no Bradley for us. Don't think having both of them back really change that series. Lakers in 5 once more with both teams 100%.  Heat: Probably has the biggest argument, though I really do think both teams 100% Lakers still win in 6. We were favored for a reason.   I just don't think there were any injuries in last year's playoffs that if they had not happened, would have led to our opponent winning. On the flip side I absolutely think a healthy Lakers team beats the Suns. I also think a healthy Murray makes the WCSF a lot closer, though ultimately the Suns probably win."
"I'm not gonna lie, I made close to a grand betting the under on Points Scored by Avery Bradley basically every game that season. It made them pain of watching him hurt a lot less."
He's signing Isaiah Thomas..... just watch. Maybe Avery Bradley too
"I was always a Gallo over Tobi guy, so when the Clippers got even better after we got rid of Tobi, and he got worse, it was very awesome. Although, the main reason we got better if that we traded Avery Bradley, who was atrocious every minute he played."
"&gt; Compare him to his peers like Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram and Pascal Siakam to name a few who had weaknesses early in their career but improved to develop their offensive game.  Not peers, but Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler were also two guys you wanted the ball far away from while on offense, and look at them now. Avery Bradley is another..."
The picks are the meat of the trade. Avery Bradley and Kelly O have the decency of not winning too many games for the team. They were just there for salary marching.
Neither are Avery Bradley and Kelly O.
Nah. Tony Allen was big. This guy could be Avery Bradley
"Allen actually won a title in Boston and left when he was far past his prime to the point that Avery Bradley had already started to replace him; it wasn't even close to KD leaving OKC. Also, in what world was he not being shopped around? It went so far as Allen being told that he had been traded to Memphis for OJ Mayo at the deadline during his last season in Boston."
"also, Avery Bradley was heating up towards the end of the season and he was stealing some time from Ray Allen.  he wasn’t treated well on the way out."
Ray Allen was 37 and the Celtics FO were looking at moving past him as well with Avery Bradley emerging.
"Dunno if you're trolling but the link starts off saying ""rookie Avery Bradley"" and he was drafted in 2010."
"Smart has some incredible games. We were the only eastern team to steal a playoffs game from the 2017 Cavs thanks to a crazy 3rd game from Smart where he had 27/5/7 2 steals and a block on 81.1% ts with 7/10 from 3. The starting lineup was Avery Bradley/Smart/Crowder/Horford/Amir Johnson with Amir getting injured midgame.  He’s had at least one crazy game every playoffs he hasn’t been injured in not counting his rookie year. As a 2nd year player, he had 20/8/5 and 2 steals on 61% ts, the 3rd highest scorer on both teams after IT and Millsap with the 2nd highest ts% of anyone after Millsap. We won that game and he was +24. He also had 23 points in our win vs the Nets this year on 96.8% ts with 72.7/62.5/100 splits. And then a bunch of games in between those 2."
"I don't see Smart starting, actually. He's done so well running the bench mob, it might stay that way. Pritchard, Smart, Big Al, Nesmith, and Kanter, that's not a bad bench to have. Starters Dennis, Brown, Tatum, Time Lord. Ehm hmm, missing another elite wing there. Healthy Hayward please ;)   To be honest, I'm not sure who else is around ATM.   But some of those guys are pretty interchangeable, like Smart and Dennis might alternate starts. Al and Rob probably will as well. In some matchups Kanter might be good to start.  We could even see Dennis, Marcus, The J's and a center. Actually, that makes a lot of sense. I've always thought Smart is better at SG not PG.  We'll probably see some Big Al PG duty again, as well.  Where is Avery Bradley? He could be nice of the bench"
Avery Bradley these days are about as productive as Gary Payton II you have on your roster tbh
I think we could make something of Avery Bradley.
"You are missing guys in that list...Here's his career drafting history in the 11-30 range:    Decent Picks| Bad Picks | Unknowns ---|---|---- Kendrick Perkins| Marcus Banks| Romeo Langford Tony Allen |  Delonte West| Grant Williams Al Jefferson|Gerald Green  | Aaron Nesmith Rajon Rondo|J.R. Giddens  |   Avery Bradley|JaJuan Johnson |  Kelly Olynyk|Jared Sullinger|  Terry Rozier| Fab Melo   |  Robert Williams| James Young    |  Payton Pritchard| RJ Hunter|    |Ante Zizic |  |Guerschon Yabusele|  With 9 good picks and 11 bad ones, he's pretty much bang on 50% in that range.  Also worth mentioning, the last 2 'bad picks' (Zizic and Yabusele) were just guys we grabbed who were willing to be stashed for a year because we needed to clear roster spots for incoming stars Al Horford and Gordon Hayward."
"Probably because: 1) Analysts liked the Clippers back then with Lou Will, Kawhi, PG13, Pat Bev, Montrezl, etc. compared to the Lakers. While the Lakers were the betting favorites, the Clippers were sort of the favorites among analysts and media. 2) There were questions on the Lakers regarding age, fit, lack of shooting, etc. They were among the oldest teams in the league (now they're even older) and their best shooters were KCP, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, and Troy Daniels (before he was waived in the middle of the season). Not to mention potential fit issues with Dwight Howard in the mix. Plus, ""AD at the 5"" debates started when they insisted on starting McGee at the 5 at the start of the season. 3) How much did Lebron have left after a rough 2018-19 season when he had a non-contact injury when he pulled his groin and he performed rather mediocre for his standards after he came back. 4) Frank Vogel: How well can he coach guys like Lebron, AD, Dwight, etc.? Sure, he's well known for his defensive schemes. But was that enough to get them over the top.  Fortunately for them, things worked out in the end. Sure, the Bubble sort of added context on how the championship will be remembered, but every playoff team had to deal with it."
Damn it. These guys are all taller. Well then I guess Avery Bradley is the best option. Or Chris Paul defensively too
You right. Avery Bradley is more of a comparison. Even prime J Kidd was a pretty good defender.
he doesnt have the size to be tony allen.  he can be avery bradley with an offensive bag
What happened to Avery Bradley?
"Damn, that's not what you Lakers fans told me last year, or this year, or right after you got eliminated.... Avery Bradley, KCP, Caruso, Green, THT, Dwight, Kuzma, Javale, Markieff, Rondo, among others as supporting cast is quite strong."
"Please see Andre Iguodala as an example of why you're wrong.  Iggy did a lot of what Smart did, and he's been in the league for ever.  Pat Bev is 33. Avery Bradley is 30, Rondo is 35.  All these guys threw their bodies around and still do, and are still playing.   PJ Tucker is 36. I mean if i really wanted to im sure I could keep naming more, like Tony Allen played till 36."
"there are some guys like Jrue that look like they can just decide to get a steal. Like it's just something they can turn on. Smart is like this at times.   I've seen lots of vets do it to rookies, too. I saw Avery Bradley do it to Fox. Just walk on the court and take it away from him."
What big free agents did the Celtics have when they made the playoffs after trading KG and PP?  Here was the roster for most of the season:  Avery Bradley/Evan Turner/Tyler Zeller/Brandon Bass/Marcus Smart  So don’t give me that small market bullshit. Plenty of other small market teams haven’t had the draft luck that the cavs have had and still at least make the playoffs.  Cavs have two modes: Lebron or bottom 5 team. There’s no in between.
So do the Lakers get Avery Bradley in this match up?
Yeah.  I was thinking Avery Bradley too.  Why do you think the Kings selected another guard?
"It's not...  He's fairly undersized.  He's shorter and has a shorter wingspan than Avery Bradley.    I'd say that a rich man's Avery Bradley is prolly a perfect comp for him, unless he shows some sort of ridiculous improvement offensively.  And Avery Bradley, without injuries, and slightly better, is a helluva player.  That's not a knock.  The expectation in this post is fucking ridiculous."
"The on ball defense certainly gives Jrue, Avery Bradley (when he was good) vibes. The shooting in SL has been encouraging; I thought his senior year outside shooting numbers seemed a bit fluky."
 Avery Bradley  Isaiah Thomas  Reggie Lewis  Len Bias  Vitaly Potapenko
"&gt;He opted to not bring back Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Dwight Howard after the Lakers won in 2020.  The Lakers could not afford to bring that team back, as most of them got raises to leave.  McGee made as much as Gasol and Howard combined in 2021.  Green made more then Schroder, and provided far less.  Rondo got a 325% raise from the Clippers.  Pelinka is not a great GM, but bringing back the 2020 Champs was never an option."
"Shai GA. As much as I like Fox I’ve watched Shai clamp him and score on him so many times. I watched Pat Bev and Avery Bradley abuse Fox on both ends in the same game. He’s playing very well, but honestly he has a lot of work to do."
Avery Bradley like 7 years ago. Dude averaged like 16 a game just on cuts
So far from these SL it looks like I’m wrong on Davion.. I thought he’s gonna be Avery Bradley with better handles and shot making.. but some of the shit he’s doing is Donovan Mitchell lite
Avery Bradley has been an unexpectedly good Steph defender.
"Avery Bradley, Rondo during his prime, Bledsoe before his fall off,"
"Ur lucky there’s so many Lebron haters so ur shit isn’t getting downvoted like crazy. Ur take just doesn’t really make sense, best defense in the league and despite what ur saying they were right around a top 10 offense.  And ik u said to the other guy u can’t assume the lakers would beat the fully healthy heat, well that’s an easy assumption for me and I don’t see any situation other than injurys where they lose the finals. Ik this doesn’t determine too much but the lakers were killing the heat prior to those injuries.   On top of that the lakers had the disadvantages of no Avery Bradley which some called there 3rd best player in the regular season (especially after they beat the clips), no home court advantage.  Just cuz Lebron killed ur team for years doesn’t mean u just need to have awful takes about him (or his teams) with little to no substance fulled by hate"
"Makes no sense. Everyone had the same advantages of no travel, maximum rest, and no fans.   Actually, the Lakers were at a disadvantage because covid cost them Home Court Advantage at *Staples* and they didn’t have Avery Bradley, their best perimeter defender and 3rd option."
"That's just the story that Tillman didn't want to deal with Morey. There is 0 evidence of trhat happening. According to Kevin O’Connor, the 76ers never made it to the asking price that included 3 FRPs and Maxey + Thybulle. Tillman cares about money more than winning though and Oladipo / Olynyk / Avery Bradley / Dante Exum / DJ Wilson were all expiring contracts to ensure the Rockets wouldn't be forced into the luxury tax that Tillman never wanted to pay in more competitive seasons even to trade draft picks to get under the tax at the 2019 deadline."
"Um, Celtics second leading scorer was Avery Bradley that year.. at 16.3ppg. They were not better without IT. He was literally only one that could create his own shot."
TIL there's an Avery Bradley FA sweepstakes.
Now we can focus on the Avery Bradley FA sweepstakes
Glad one of us is…  Who’s even still available? Avery Bradley? Chriss?
The quick footwork is very similar to prime Avery Bradley on guards.
"Yeah Avery Bradley, Tremont Waters, etc."
"Josh Hart, JJ Redick, Wes Matthews, Paul Milsap, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Avery Bradley, Etuan moore, Langston Galloway, Frank Nitilinka, Stanley Johnson, etc.   There’s plenty of bodies still out there and they just need to eat up minutes in the regular season."
"I think some of them are in an odd position. They may not all be good enough to crack the rotation but they're too known to ride the bench. If you're an NBA team, do you sign an Avery Bradley just to give him 0 minutes every game? He's not Theo Pinson (I love you Theo, I'm sorry), he's a well known vet that had a legit career."
"There’s a video of Avery Bradley talking about exactly this. If you run by their side, apparently it’s less likely you’ll get called for a foul. You have to gauge which way they are going and then run across them"
"&gt;I'm a bit confused by how low the # of all defensive teams is for iggy  Dave Berri showed, I believe in ""The Wages of Wins,"" how a players votes for defensive awards went up as their scoring did. Basically, the best way to get more defensive awards votes was to score more.   It also hurts Iguodala's case that two things seem to drive the public perception of defense:  1) On-ball perimeter defense, delivered with attitude.   2) Emphatic blocks, even if they go out of bounds.   Iguodala's great at on-ball perimeter defense, but what makes him a head-and-shoulders better defender than Tony Allen, Avery Bradley, John Wall, or Mike Conley (the guys who landed all-defense spots above him) was this preternatural ability to break up an offensive set off ball. He had a near-unique ability to anticipate a key pass, and simply move ahead of the play in a way that the pass was never even attempted, and the offense had to reset.  The value of something like that was something you had to watch him to see, especially because until 2015 or so awards voters tended to scoff at analytics.   Also, Kobe deserved many of his defensive accolades, but his all-defensive picks in '11 and '12 were absurd - entirely based on reputation and not what he was actually doing on the floor. There were some great posts on Silver Screen and Roll - a Lakers fan blog - breaking down just how awful his defense was in that period).   In my opinion, Iguodala is one of the most criminally underrated players of the past 30 years. We have four examples (Iguodala leaving Philly, arriving in Denver, leaving Denver, arriving in Golden State) which suggest that Iguodala's presence was worth 10-15 spots in the team defensive rankings. That's unheard of for a perimeter player."
Everybody knew IT wasn’t being re-signed. The Avery Bradley trade hurt a lot worse honestly
Would rather have Avery Bradley if he isn't under contract yet
"It's certainly up there. Some common occurences will be teams that take an aging HoF big in their last year or so. One unmentioned one so far in this thread are the 1997 Bulls, who had Robert Parrish on the roster.  PG Ron Harper  SG Michael Jordan  SF Scottie Pippen  PF Dennis Rodman  C Robert Parrish  6^th Man Toni Kukoc  The 2011 Celtics would be interesting with two players that were unanimously the best player in the league at their peak.  PG Rondo  SG Allen  SF Pierce  PF Garnett  C Shaq  6^th Man Jermaine O'Neal  (Also on the roster arw Avery Bradley, Troy Murphy, Nenad Krstic, and Delonte West who never had HoF primes, but did have strong individual seasons with ~16-17ppg)"
Alex Caruso did get paid.  He's making almost $10M which is pretty good for someone who isn't a handling the ball and isn't taking very many threes.  Dennis Shroder would have gotten paid if he didn't play himself and act like a complete asshole last year.   But you're right on Chalmers. With Avery Bradley he's quite old and to be fair he skipped out on the playoffs.
Oh no.. not Avery Bradley
"Mozgov contact is such an anomaly now tbh.. I know that’s been the talking point for a few years now with bron gets people payed but hasn’t it really only been big men? Mozgov and TT both got big deals but I think if this Dennis stuff holds true and he doesn’t get much money it’ll look like guards playing with bron don’t get nearly the same payment. Chalmers in miami, caruso, Dennis, Avery bradley"
"I won't blame Lacob for not paying, what, $25 or $30 million (after taxes) for a guy who doesn't fill a need/move the needle. I'm not remotely convinced Shroeder is worth it for the Warriors, even assuming they could get him for the MLE - he's a bad fit.   Even Avery Bradley is really more of a shooter than a PG at this point.   If Lacob wasn't willing to use it for guys like Batum or Mills, that'd be one thing. But he was."
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they’ve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.   That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on “name” teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.   On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don’t match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo’s preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he’s really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn’t afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu’s contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don’t think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that’s only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.   We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.   At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.   Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans’ Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22’ 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D’Antoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it’s not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart’s rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.   By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.   You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.   Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he’s expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don’t do anything else, or they don’t have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they’ve received, even if this year’s team outperforms last year’s. "

"Sure if you pretend Nunn, Harrell, Avery Bradley don’t exists just from the past 2 FAs  That’s also not mention the dozen other FAs thst have signed with the Lakers for cheap over the last couple years"
Jimmy missed a ton of time. Dragic. Herro. Nunn missed time. Dipo only ended up playing 4 games for us. Even Bam missed time. Avery Bradley was hurt all year. The Heat were playing straight bum gleaguers Max Strus and Gabe Vincent significant time lol
"This is Tony Bradley, a center. When I first skimmed it it I thought Avery Bradley too. Thankfully the Bulls are now addressing the front court gaps."
When did Tony Snell and Avery Bradley have a baby?
Avery Bradley is still hanging around somewhere
Does Avery Bradley have a deal yet?
"After him, I think Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Josh Hart, and Wes Matthews. Probably holding off for better offers before having to settle."
How much money do they have?  My guess is anybody they sign is bench depth.  I'd be surprised if Avery Bradley doesn't end up there
"""Avery Bradley, u there?"""
That still counts. Avery Bradley deserved a ring and he didn’t play in that playoffs.
Lakers still have 3 more spots so i think they add a few more players. Might be Avery Bradley or wes matthews.
"They will still be adding a couple of defensive guys. I expect Matthews to be back and maybe Avery Bradley.  But as it is, this is definitely a much improved offensive team compared to what they had last season. None of the guys outside of LeBron and AD was contributing to anything offensively last season, so bringing in some help is key for them."
"As was Avery Bradley before he no-showed the bubble, yet someone else stepped up and replaced him.  Because he was a replacement level player."
"I think people sleep on the 2011 Celtics.   Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal  Nate Robinson, Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Jermaine O'Neal, Kendrick Perkins  Delonte West, Marquis Daniels and Glen ""Big Baby"" Davis for the meme bench players.  But for real, that starting 5 and top 10 players are pretty nutty. All time Jermaine O'Neal as an after thought is pretty crazy. Best all time team ever? Probably not. But it's certainly slept on"
Who guards point guards? You've lost all you decent to good guard defenders.  A pickup like Avery Bradley could be huge in cases where your guards are getting cooked.
this is why I would really love to see us hand a minimum to Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley is who I'm hoping they get
"definitely, first boogie and lance stephenson, now avery bradley and kendrick nunn. they’ve got a nice little roster of alleged women beaters going. there’s that mamba mentality for you"
I'll take Avery Bradley!
No he's pretty small and thin. More like Avery Bradley on defense
"while true, the way more important need we have is GUARDING point guards, Russ/Bron can play point on offense but we need someone who plays defense on 1s, which schroeder is great at and also why I would love to see Avery Bradley or someone like that come back (dont know if even possible). most pressing need without a doubt right now is guarding point guards cus Russ dont do that anymore."
Last piece to the puzzle is hopefully Danny Green or Avery Bradley
"I think you will sign Avery Bradley. His market isn’t really there, and he played well for the Lakers, so i can see him signing with you guys"
Avery Bradley?
Saw some guy on the lakers sub call him Avery Bradley with better offense. I guess this year did some serious work for his reputation.
"and i bet we get Avery Bradley, making Caruso, at that salary slot, even more redundant"

To the Lakers on minimums:  Avery Bradley Wes Matthews Marrief Morris Rudy Gay Tony Snell Carmelo
"&gt; best perimeter guard rotation  Defensive perimeter guard rotation. Though the year before that was arguably even better (Avery Bradley, with a bit of Quinn Cook) offering  different look.  Though Rondo was not great defensively, he made up for it in the bubble with his playmaking."
"I wrote this on the lakers sub but I'm gonna copy it here:  He got a 4 year deal and he's already 27. In two years lebron and Westbrook might be gone and we're gonna be trying to build around AD. Do you want to pay for caruso's age 30 and 31 seasons when lebron's gone? Do you want him on our cap sheet at the time when we're gonna need the most possible flexibility? I don't think he's gonna age well so the second half of that contract is gonna suck. Someone like avery bradley can give us 80% of what we lost for 20% of the cost. People in this sub are too emotional. Given the tax implications, makes no sense to pay 40 million for an 8-9th man that's gonna play 20 minutes. With Westbrook on the team, Caruso wasn't gonna play in crunch time either. Plus the roster hasn't even been completed yet. If a team with Lebron, AD, and Westbrook  can't win without Caruso, then a team with those 3 just isn't good enough to win."
They’re gonna sign Avery Bradley for the minimum who was a dog for them last season before he sat out the bubble and he will make the Lakers faithful give 0 fucks about Caruso.
"Well, the only reason I can guess is that his contract would have cost us ~$30-$40M total after luxury tax, and they think they can replace his production.  There’s rumors out there about Patty Mills potentially signing for the TPMLE, and Avery Bradley potentially for the veterans minimum, so that could be it. That said, it’s still dumb from an asset management perspective. It’s not like we couldn’t have flipped him mid-season for a pick or two if they wanted to save on the tax.."
"Avery Bradley replaces him and saves us like 35m and Rob likely learned last year that you can't have a full 15 guys who expect to play   Fas at the min likely want to see a clearer path to a payout like tucker, Payne, rose and others got"
One Danny Green and Avery Bradley please
Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley or Rudy Gay
Avery Bradley back soon too?
"Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, Wes Matthews, Jr Smith, Isaiah Thomas, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Rudy Gay and Darren Collison"
"Lakers need him for defense more than anything. The Lakers defense has been their identity the past couple years. But now they've lost/could lose: KCP, Kuzma, Danny Green, Avery Bradley, Schroder, Wes Matthews, and Caruso. Vogel is a good defensive coach, but at some point you need the personnel too. The only plus defenders we have under contract right now are Lebron and AD"
"They are likely getting wes back, possibly Avery Bradley. By all reports Caruso/tht will also be there still. Their guard rotation is fine. No one will be a lights out shooter but all these guys hit on open catch and shoot shots   I think schoder just walks for nothing at this point. Too many guards on the market moving around and I don’t think anyone wants to overplay for an unrestricted free agent"
"Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, Jae Crowder, Terry Rozier"
"Avery Bradley, crowder, Kelly, Amir"
"The year is 2034, Jayson Tatum has retired. Brad Stevens is rolling out a starting five of Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jae Crowder, and Al Horford"
"So they're now interested and rumored to be wanting to sign IT, Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and Jeff Green.  Brad is truly saying fuck it and resetting the clock to 2017."
"He’s really gonna bring back his Celtics from the good ol days isn’t he (IT, Horford, Kelly Olynk, Avery Bradley)"
It's more of a matter of cap flexibility - you got 3 guys on your roster now making over 30M a year.  There's a decent amount of bargain-bin guys I'd be interested in; take Dennis on a reduced deal if he comes back with a tail between his legs. Wouldn't mind either Avery Bradley or Cory Joseph on a min. Same with Austin Rivers.  I'd hate to see them pry away TJ McConnell or Patty Mills but there's a few more names.
This is not the Avery Bradley from two years ago.
"At the start of the 2nd and 4th quarters, when you're up by 16, Avery Bradley is perfect player to come in and guard Rajon Rondo, or Lou Williams or even D.J. Augustin for 8-12 quality minutes."
"No one would have ever heard of Terrance Mann if Doc was still the Clippers coach.  Heck, he didn't even want to play SGA until Pat Bev and Avery Bradley got hurt and he was forced to."
Avery Bradley had a year or two there where he was the only guy Kyrie couldn't shake. If we're talking purely on-ball he has to be up there.
That's a good point. I hope Avery Bradley isn't washed. I always loved his game
Avery Bradley will be coming off the bench instead Wanamaker last year.
It's for training camp  &gt;Avery Bradley fills up the last remaining camp spot for the Warriors. He will compete for the vacant 15th roster spot.  [Source](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1441467393058824194?s=20)
how is avery bradley not getting signed to a guaranteed contract by anybody this is ridiculous
“The Warriors are focusing on signing wings and frontcourt players”  *15 minutes later*  “[Shams] Warriors sign Avery Bradley”
I feel like I read this exact thing about Avery Bradley every single offseason.
Regular season coaching versus playoffs... Perimeter defense is terrible during the regular season but postseason perimeter defense is good. I call it the Avery Bradley rule where he makes regular season 3s since he can shoot wide open shoots. In the postseason he never gets those and shoots terribly.
Avery Bradley would be good fit due to his defensive awareness &amp; space the floor as well
Avery Bradley should have been signed by someone already. He definitely isn't on IT's prove-it-in-a-workout level.
"Wes Matthews had a pretty good streak going  I’d throw Dwight, Jeff Teague, and Avery Bradley in there too"
"The entire Lob city era was filled with drama and issues and only way Doc managed through it was because he was there during the Sterling drama.  Clippers had the Chris Paul/Blake stuff,  Doc telling everyone DeAndre Jordan hacking wasn’t a issue when it was, the nepotism with bringing in Austin Rivers, Doc when he was the GM signing players to deals and giving them different roles as a coach, media telling him to play SGA when he was obsessed with playing Avery Bradley, and his track record handling young player in general"
"Rockets took a worse offer to get 4 first round picks and a bunch of pick swaps, most of which are most likely going to be late late picks. The 3rd and 4th being a pick in 2026 and a pick swap in 2027. Everything else will be in the KD era of Brooklyn.   They also got Oladipo, who they traded away for Avery Bradley, Olynyk, and a shared pick swap with Brooklyn and Miami. Both of those players left in FA btw.  I genuinely believe in the ""screw Morey"" theory, where Tilman took the deal that was worse for his team, but didn't help Morey out. Who I'm assuming he actually hates after igniting the China stuff. He also didn't have to pay Ben AND Wall. Now it looks like he's back in because he wants to get rid of Wall's contract for a player on a lesser deal who could actually add efficiency to their team."
Avery Bradley once pet my dog.
"Avery Bradley (Calf), Heat Legend"
Damn what happened to Avery Bradley.
"He was good for us when he played. He just couldn't stay healthy, so it was easier to ship him out for Oladipo and, although Oladipo got injured too. Oladipo at full healthy is more impactful for us than Avery Bradley at full health. I'd personally wrlcome him back to Miami. I'd rather have him over Gabe Vincent."
"You started off this conversation about the Bubble and him not attending though, so don't bring in all this other stuff now lol If you'd just said, ""Well he's on the wrong side of 30, isn't very talented offensively, losing his athleticism"" in the first place, those are all valid points, but you specifically magnified the Bubble attendance, and then used the current situation as proof of your point about the Bubble, and not remotely that Avery Bradley as a professional basketball player is not worth a contract right now. You could even say right now ""That Bubble thing was stupid, but here's A, B, and C"" and you'd be right lol"
I feel like this is a workout for Avery Bradley and we're inviting the other guys to give him some roughly-NBA-quality competition
We need SF depth. Not 6’2 Avery Bradley. I’m sure he’s still a serviceable player elsewhere
"And you need to use your best asset and think through that a little more.   Avery Bradley going to the bubble was not going to expose his son to Covid, if anything, it was going to take out a potential vector.   This was obvious a year ago and it’s obvious now."
How did Avery Bradley go from a key missing piece for the Lakers in the Bubble to nearly out of the league?
How is Avery Bradley vs IT even a choice lol
"Sure let's call them relatively healthy then.  Although, that's like me saying that Lakers weren't at full strength because Avery Bradley didn't go to the bubble."
"yeah being an elite defensive player hasn’t helped his team get out of the second round. It’s overrated. NBA games are won by scoring points, not occasional  defense. Ben is a Defensive specialists like Tony Allen or Avery Bradley and shouldn’t be a max contract.   That’s how trash Ben Simmons is as an overall player. John wall looks like a better option."
"Probably mix of Lakers and Dubs fans cause we are who has had Cook recently   Id definitely take a stab at Bradley over him. Avery started for us and was solid, Cook got ran off the court anytime it wasn't garbage time"
Would he be a servicable PG though?  We're picking from.  Quinn Cook Isaiah Thomas Arcediacano Avery Bradley Darren Collison Gary Payton II Chris Chiozza  Cook has a Championship or two... always shot well.  Knows the system extremely well.  I think this is actually the one they pull trigger on gut feeling.
Even Avery Bradley would help
I think you’re right in the sense that he can be pretty decent when locked in. Keep in mind he was getting Avery Bradley comps in college before he had his big offensive breakthrough. But in college he didn’t have this offensive workload. Tbh I just don’t see him ever putting in the effort to really turn up his defensive motor (which isn’t a bad trade off all things considered)
Same thing happened with Avery Bradley.
"&gt; Gerald Green  Old and injured  &gt; Isaiah Thomas  Injury-prone, lost explosivity and is 5'9.  &gt;Avery Bradley  Was **really** bad last year with Houston  &gt; Tyler Zeller  Below-average big men are incredibly replaceable in the modern NBA  &gt; Dion Waiters  Not good at scoring efficiently or at all, not a great personality  &gt; DMC  This one is fair. He should probably have a spot somewhere.  The rest pretty much follow the same logic as those I stated. There's good reason why all those guys aren't playing anymore."
"few others that came to mind are Gerald Green, Dante Cunningham, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Tyler Zeller, Hollis Thompson, Ty Lawson (i understand this one but dude can BALL), Dion Waiters, John Henson, DeMarcus Cousins, Amir Johnson, Jarrett Jack, Jeremy Lin, Jeff Teague, Bismack Biyombo, Courtney Lee, Brandon Goodwin, Ersan Ilyasova, Brandan Wright, Mo Speights"
"I'm impressed by his growth as a defender, having heard people around here you'd swear its just entirely a part of the system he's in but even in a lot of isolation situations against one of the best scorers ever KD holds up well.      Also I hate that you can slowly see Bron's drive die as the series progresses and he realizes that his team's outmatched. Going into it most assumed the warriors would win, but not that they'd be as dominant against the Cavs as they were. It was two teams that were honestly bitching the rest of the leagues in the playoffs dead set on a collision course. The Warriors and Cavs had a combined record of 24-1 in the playoffs until they'd met, honestly it would have been 24-0 had Avery Bradley not channeled the spirit of Ray Allen during the Celtics/Cavs matchup."
"AFAIK it started with Ray wanting to trade Rondo and then Rondo ended up icing him out of games, which led to talks of Avery Bradley taking Ray's starting role."
"A lot actually.  Folks already mentioned Shaq, Rondo and Schroder (soon), but off the top of my head there’s McAdoo, B Shaw, Rick Fox￼, Glove, IT and Avery Bradley"
"My favorite Damper moment - yes, above membership in the two-headed center juggernaut with Adonal Foyle on the Dubs - was his part in the [Avery Bradley nut shot](https://youtu.be/gLV3a4CgYLE).  Cracks me up every time..."
Avery Bradley
I'm kinda surprised a team didn't give him a spot by now. Then again Avery Bradley and Mike Scott are still free agents out there
"&gt;	Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradley  These guys are guards. There’s no question about it. You might say it’s a three guard lineup with LeBron, but I think that’s a little silly when LeBron is guarding other forwards in that lineup."
"Positions are fluid, so he’s both. But Luka literally started at point guard this year, because Josh Richardson, Hardaway Jr, DFS are definitely not point guards. Early in his career when he started with Dennis Smith Jr., or games when Brunson starts, Luka is a point forward, not the point guard.  People bring up LeBron being a point guard but he’s started with other actual point guards for most of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). In the Lakers year where Danny Green &amp; Avery Bradley/KCP would start, then yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Either than that he’s largely been a point forward."
"As a Lakers fan, I’m not happy about the signing. But I would normally say ‘well LeBron knows what he’s doing.’ And then I remember them singing Drummond and for sure LeBron had to be keen on that in order to happen. And now Westbrook…I think LeBron has a certain strategy in mind but it’s risky. I would have just tried to find 3 and D guys, and athletic players.   There’s a reason Danny Green, Caruso, Avery Bradley, Dwight, worked in 2020.  This year we have instead Ariza, Ellington, Monk, Nunn, and now 2021’s Drummond - DeAndre Jordan."
"the KG point is laughably stupid so I won’t even address that. LeBron has started with other point guards for the majority of his career (Eric Snow, Mo Williams, Chalmers, Kyrie, etc.). So for the majority of his career he’s been a forward. The year he started with Danny Green and KCP or Avery Bradley, yes LeBron was the point guard that year. Because those other guys are flat out not point guards.  Again you’re just dodging my original question lol. Who started at point for the Mavs this year? Hardaway Jr? Josh Richardson?"
They should've gone for Avery Bradley IMO
"I think I spent a lot more time than I should for this question. I define trade as we either give an asset or receive an asset from another team. All the players we waived that signed with Lakers (i.e. Avery Bradley, Dion Waiters, etc.) are not trades. They were Free Agents.

"Avery Bradley will be on a roster and he will be good.    DMC will be picked up at some point in the season by a desperate team.   Wesley Matthews will be on a roster.   JJ Redick is mentally checked out, he might play in NY/Phila but I do not think any of those teams really want him. He's kind of done.   IT is done."
"Demarcus Cousins and JJ Reddick aren't done. They still have NBA skills even if they got glaring weaknesses in their games that grow bigger. Demarcus has the added benefit that stars respect him even if he can't play much.   IT is done. Avery Bradley and Wesley Matthews might be, honestly there's a lot of guys who try to make the league as 3 and D, basically everyone is 3 and D now if they're not a star or a starter."
"&gt;Demarcus Cousins, Avery Bradley, Wesley Matthews, JJ Redick, Isaiah Thomas  That'd be an interesting starting lineup in 2016, though admittedly rather on the small side of things. The passage of time can be a cruel mistress. And injuries. Ugh, injuries just suck."
"I don't think Avery Bradley is anywhere near done, just had a bad year with injuries. Wesley Matthews I think can still play 3 and D somewhere. Everyone else is done imo. Redick might sign somewhere but he won't get playoff minutes"
"2017 starters: IT, horford, jae crowder, avery bradley, amir johnson. no superstars.   2018: the celtics beat the sixers 4-1 in the 2018 second round to reach the ECF. were the sixers meh competition?  2020: everyone had the same environment?"
"At least whoever they get back for Simmons won’t be as bad as Harden for Kelly olynyk, Avery Bradley and picks"
"I was pretty concerned with Avery Bradley opting out of the bubble but overall they were able to burp out an 8-man rotation that worked fine. Definitely carried heavy by LeBron and AD though.  Starting lineup: Lebron, AD, KCP, Danny Green, Caruso  Bench: Kuzma, Rondo, Markieff Morris  Howard played like 10 minutes a game but was a horrible matchup against Bam"
"Go on name the other shooters. I’ll give you one for free, Avery Bradley who we didn’t need in the playoffs. Kieff was ok"
"I've met LeBron before. He's pretty douchey but puts on a great face for the cameras and the kids. This was when he went back to Cleveland. On the other hand Tristan Thompson was super friendly, which may come as a surprise to a lot of people.   Giannis on the other hand, is one of the nicest people I've ever met. The only nicer NBA player I've met is Cory Joseph.   On a random note, Joe Young who had a cup of coffee for the NBA players is a real douche, and Avery Bradley is pretty douchey as well."
"KG is a Top 5 Bitch in NBA history, so theres that.  Celtics tried trading Allen multiple times. Doc Rivers, the worst active coach at the moment by a comfortable margin, reduced his minutes and favored a baby Avery Bradley over him, even though Allen was shooting 40% from 3 and Celtics needed more scoring. Oh, and the front office tried to not pay him.  So what did he do? What any thinking man would have done. He wasn’t getting respect, play time, money, OR a chance to compete with the Celtics. So he decided to accept a clear-cut role on a contender. Why would have he stayed with the franchise that offered him nothing and continuously disrespect him?"
"I really don’t see the reason for such a visceral reaction towards buyouts when statistically speaking, they almost never pan out to do anything. Avery Bradley wasn’t even in the bubble with us. Dion was a meme more than a player, and Dwight had to agree to a non-guaranteed “you better behave” contract to even sign with us in 2019-20.  Plus, Drummond sucked. Blake was good for the Nets, I’ll admit."
Avery Bradley wasn’t even in his 30’s at the start of that season. Ariza is nowhere near
"Like Dwight hasn’t lived up to his namesake for 11…………11 just in case y’all forgot, 11 years.   Avery Bradley has been in the league for like a decade now. How old are you feeling now?    Rondo is now a role player. It makes me feel old too. But it is what is it.   And Dion???? C’mon now.  Tell me please what he can give me that I can’t get from a rookie or a journeyman."
"I feel like you could make a team out of the people we have bought out and then signed with the Lakers. Typing this, I can only think of Dwight Howard and Rondo, but I feel like there are more.  EDIT: Avery Bradley? I can’t remember how he left the team."
Didn't you know? Dion Waiters and Avery Bradley were the missing pieces for the Grizzlies to be a top 5 team in the west just like Chris Paul was for the Suns or Gallo/Bogi were for the Hawks
"Nunn is a bench player who wasn't getting minutes during the bubble run. He went into the season behind Dragic/Robinson/Herro/Bradley in the guard rotation. Using his per-game statistics in a season where he started due to injuries, and using those statistics to argue in his favor, implies you believe he was already good enough to get those minutes, even without the injuries.   If injuries aren't the reason he played, why was he cut out of the rotation during the bubble run? Why did he lose his minutes the following season to Avery Bradley? Why was he let go in favor of an injured Oladipo and an unproven Max Strus?"
"First of all, LeBron was not on the Lakers when KCP signed with them, and he most definitely didn't turn down that contract with Detroit specifically so he sign with the Lakers. He turned down their offer thinking they would up the offer (or get a bigger offer from someone else), but instead the Pistons traded for Avery Bradley, which used up the cap space they had with which to offer KCP anything. This left KCP kinda out in the cold as most teams had used their cap space already.   The only team that really had any space left was the Lakers, and that was because they had only been willing to offer players a 1 year deal because they were targeting the following summer and wanted to keep their cap space open. As a result they'd missed on previous targets (i.e. George Hill). KCP being desperate took a 1 year deal that paid him $18 million to play for the Lakers. Then he took a $12 million deal. Then an $8 million deal, then he signed that $39 million deal that he's currently on. So he turned down that $80 million contract but has since made (or is still owed) $75 million and he won a ring. I doubt he has any regrets.   As for Trez, it's absurd to say he took less money just cause Rich Paul wanted him on the Lakers, like Trez had no say in the matter. We don't know what the other offers for him were, but he probably felt they weren't that great so he decided to try to chase a ring for a year and hit free agency again. It's not that uncommon.  Why is it that people think that either LeBron or Rich Paul have this ability to make players sign where they don't want to for less money? When Dennis Schroder passed on his extension with the Lakers, I didn't see anyone blaming his agent, they all felt like that was his choice. Why is it just Rich Paul that gets judged like this?"
"In hindsight all those trades are godawful, I’m not denying that. But Harden with the Rockets was in his prime, fresh off of however many consecutive first team all-NBA appearances and top 3 MVP finishes, and they traded him for KPJ, Victor Oladipo (who they’d later flip for Avery Bradley and Kelly fucking Olynyk), and some future picks that will all be late first rounders most likely.   Kobe, Pippen, and so one were all rookies that hadn’t been drafted yet, so there was no guarantee how good they’d be. Everyone knew how good Harden is, and they still traded him for chump change, then somehow made their take even worse."
Not every front office is trading a superstar player  for a bag of chips and a small soda. The usual package will be AD level not Kelly olynk and Avery Bradley( or a washed oladipo lol) with meaningless picks lol
"I dont think picking up Avery was a bad decision. He can still play D and hit shots. I do think on a team thats already as old as the Lakers, signing another older player can be criticized. But in a vacuum signing Bradley isn't hurting the Lakers."
"I think Bron decided Westbrook vs. Hield. But Rob decided to grab every geriatric vet to round out this bench, which has no defense and no energy. There's no young guy nipping on their heals to motivate any of these guys. Bron ain't deciding every signing of the 15. DJ was traded with assets just to get rid of him, and Rob picked him up as soon as he could. Avery Bradley was so bad he was cut by the Warriors but Rob decided to pick him up to round out this roster. These are bad GM decisions."
"How about the Clippers screwing themselves with Luke Kennard on this deal:  Nets receive: G Landry Shamet and draft rights to F Reggie Perry (57th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Los Angeles; G Bruce Brown from Detroit  Clippers receive: G Luke Kennard, C Justin Patton and four second-round draft picks (Portland 2023, Detroit 2024, 2025 and 2026) from Detroit; draft rights to G/F Jay Scrubb (55th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft) from Brooklyn  Pistons receive: Draft rights to Saddiq Bey (19th overall pick in 2020 NBA draft), F Dzanan Musa, draft rights to G Jaylen Hands and Toronto's 2021 second-round draft pick from Brooklyn; G Rodney McGruder and cash considerations from Los Angeles  You get .. Kennard, who you proceed to extend for a crazy price of 14 mil a year,(Mavs fans even mock the clips over it  https://fansided.com/2021/06/04/mavs-fans-are-taunting-luke-kennard-contract/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Kennard%20inked%20a,63%20games%20played%20this%20season )  and you gave away what would have been Saddiq Bey.  Saddiq is already much better than Kennard, and has a cheap rookie contract.  Disaster for the clips, payback for dealing the Pistons Blake hah.  The blake griffin trade is worse, in retrospect.  Pistons gave up Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and future first- and second-round draft picks"
The anti avery bradley
*kicks tires on the corpse of Avery Bradley*
Patrick Williams doing his best Avery Bradley/Tony Snell impression again...
The Lakers gave rings to both Avery Bradley and Demarcus Cousins in 2020.   Bradley didn’t go to the bubble and we got Boogie mid-season (he was injured anyway)
"No. He has the power but that doesn't mean he is flexing it all the time. Why would he want that headache? Lebron didn't decide to let Caruso walk, trade Zubac to the Clippers, draft Reaves, draft THT, sign Rondo, Avery Bradley, and Dwight, let them all go, and then sign them all again.  You can tell what moves he was involved in (the Ad trade)."
Because every Laker bench player (except for two minutes of Avery Bradley) was a positive.
Avery Bradley before the bubble tbh
These Avery Bradley box scores are reminding me of my intramural basketball career.
I see it's time for Avery Bradley to get some cardio in
"It’s a bad sign when our best perimeter defender currently is Avery Bradley, and he’s kind of over the hill at this point. I know the owners didn’t want to pay into the tax so much on Caruso, but I really wish we would have kept him."
"Nunn and THT are going to take minutes from Kent Bazemore, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Malik Monk.  Nothing to see here."
The Avery Bradley snub is real
"Unironically, might even be a net negative due to the lack of fit.   Roster spots are scarce in the league and the team has had to say goodbye to some pretty interesting players (Chriss, Bell, Avery Bradley, Mulder, etc). A player not only has to be good to make the roster, but also must be a fit in terms of skill set and needs. Although Paschall was first team all-rookie, he was a niche player in reality."
I see what you're saying but Aldridge was a waiver player and was a key to the Nets comeback win last night. Just pointing out that it depends on player and situation and you shouldn't generalize so much.  The Lakers have played 2 games. That's not enough for you to say Avery Bradley was a terrible pickup. They're paying him the league min. It's way to soon to make these assumptions.
"Unpopular opinion: they were a great team and better than their 51-31 win regular season record but there stats are inflated by blowing through the worst East that we've arguably ever seen. In the ECF, Avery Bradley led the Celtics in scoring by over 5ppg with 19ppg on .481 TS. In the ECSF vs the Cavs, 21 ppg .511 TS derozan lead the raptors (lowry out 2 games). The only genuinely good player they faced was PG on the 42-win Pacers -28/8/8 on .550 TS and every single game was incredibly close despite the sweep (only +16 over the 4 games)"
"I might be in the wrong but I don’t see anything wrong here. He blocked Johnson who fell and would get an easy layup after the fast break. The defense wasn’t set and the lakers missed a wide open Avery Bradley. Not really lebrons fault, rondo should’ve been able to find someone with the defense scrambling."
We seriously signed Tony Snell this off season after Dame gave the front office an ultimatum to improve the roster. Looks like we should have made a run at picking up Avery Bradley off waivers.
"yeah, maybe they don't get nunn and monk without the starpower allure of lebron-ad-russ (???) but i think dwight and rondo (and avery bradley) would all happily re-sign, and melo would definitely sign with his banana boat buddy."
The worst part of this is Avery Bradley was wide open at the 3 point line for the entire play and no one hit him.
So Terrick Rosse = Avery Bradley
"Another reason why that weird story, about how Draymond and Curry and Andre pushing for Avery Bradley, if true goes to show why GMs make the moves and not the players alone."
"Seeing as how he’s getting rotation minutes so soon after being picked up, I guess Avery Bradley."
Is this the anti Avery Bradley?
Vintage Avery Bradley HBK should have played more
"The roster is a rusted out Honda Civic being pushed to the gas station by two bodybuilders, and they are trying to sell it as if it's a BMW 7 series that just needs some engine work.   All of their players who can defend can't shoots. All of their players who can shoot can't do it reliably and can't defend at all. Deeply flawed is a kind way to describe this roster.  * The Lakers are paying Westbrook 41m dollars to be one of the least capable off-ball guards in the entire league, kill their spacing on offense, force the action every time he has an opportunity due to lack of touches, and turn the ball over 4-5 times a night in a baffling manner. He is a terrible shooter, he is a decidedly below average to bad defender at the most dangerous position in the league, and his decision making remains questionable at best; and he's being sold as the 3rd member of a ""Big 3"" to mirror the Nets. Kyrie might be less detrimental to the Nets than Westbrook is to the Lakers offense right now.  * Carmelo was graded as one of the worst defenders in the league the past two years and has to be hidden or pulled. It's possible that he could flirt with 40/40/85 this year on limited minutes, but he may give up as many points as he generates, provides no playmaking, no screening, no off-ball movement as he's a statue, and very little contested rebounding if any.  * Malik Monk has essentially all of the same flaws but is a worse shooter. He has upside as a defender if he can figure it out considering his physical tools and super long arms, but the Monk defensive tape from last year is nightmarish. Last thing the Lakers need as a ""championship team"" is a young streaky player who is learning to play passable defense.  * Rondo is Rondo. You'll get a coinflip on if he can make a 3 and a layup a game, or he wills core 0 points. He's the only person on the bench who can facilitate in a positive manner, but has slowed down making that playmaking much less dynamic, and his defense has fallen off a cliff.  * Avery Bradley has played for 7 different teams in 5 seasons, including getting traded back or picked up off waivers by some of those teams later on. He provides almost no value as a player anymore which is why Miami and LA/LAC tossed him in prior years. Washed as a defender and was never a good shooter.  * Austin Reaves is a 23 year old rookie on a supposedly contending team full of vets, who LA is playing due to depseration via injury.  * THT may very well be a solid defender this year and much needed in that regard for the Lakers. However he cannot shoot for shit meaning if he's on the floor with the starters then the starters are running WB and THT at the same time and have thrown their offense/spacing into a tar pit and will watch it slowly slip away along with whatever lead they may have.  * I like Nunn. I legitimately think if he's healthy and improved he could be the Lakers 3rd best player this year.  * Ariza is washed. Box score stats will fool anyone trying to be optimistic. He is extremely slow and his man defense is atrocious.  He will struggle the entire year with his speed, more injuries, and to get to league average from 3.  * Wayne Ellington has generated no interest from contending teams in years. Miami threw him to Detroit in 19 for good reason. Below average to poor team defender, bad man defender, extremely streaky shooter, offers nothing else of value.  * Kent Bazemore is your 2nd best guard on the team. Not even injury riddled Golden State last year wanted to play him more than 20 minutes a night. He is an absurdly streaky shooter, most years of his career he's a flat out awful shooter, but will be one of the only players the Lakers can put out late in games because of his defense and plausible ability to make an open 3 32-37% of the time if needed.  * There is one of two Dwight Howards you are going to get for 15 minutes a night. You are either going to get a physical rebounder who comes in and tires out an opposing big man to the tune of 6 fouls per 36 minutes, or you're going to get WWE Superstar Dwight who decides to goon it up, put a team in the bonus, injury someone, or pick up a flagrant foul.  * The Nets paid to get DeAndre Jordan off of a team that had no other center on it.  So you take all of that and try to get a team of a bunch of players who have never played together to suddenly figure out a way to not only do that, but in a way that improves or hides all of their weaknesses.   Not only do they have to figure that out before the playoffs but they also have to somehow stay healthy with a roster that is the oldest in the league on average by a whopping two full years.   The roster is filled with older guys who are absolutely not going to make it a full season without getting injured. Ariza is already out after getting ankle surgery. Ellington is already out with a hamstring that is going to remain a constant issue. Bradley and Rondo are both real injury risks as the season goes on. Plus you have your best or second best player in Anthony Davis being notoriously injury prone and unable to make it through a full season and a LeBron who is clearly slowing down.  So not only do you have this roster that outside of LBJ/AD is pretty god awful when fully healthy, you're going to have to deal with guys getting injured and missing time all year and try to fill their spots with the even worse players behind them.   I assume the Lakers thought that for all the flaws on both ends of the ball that AD and LeBron could either make up for them or diminish them in some way, which maybe they can to some degree, but absolutely not to the point of making this roster good. It is a complete and total dumpster fire and they have absolutely nothing to offer in a trade scenario or cap room to bring on some miracle impact player who would want to head over to LA."
&gt; literally the next day lakers signed him.  He literally fits in with the Lakers age profile perfectly.  Still can't believe the Lakers are spending money on Avery Bradley &amp; DeAndre Jordan...
"Miss a few shots, 'cause a couple fouls. It cost the Lakers 32.2k for Avery Bradley to do that. For any of us to do it, we'd get payed 11.2k. Sign me up! Save some cap Pelinka!"
"I used to think Avery Bradley was so good, when he was on the Celtics I thought he was incredibly important.  It’s honestly pretty sad how his career has turned since he was there"
How tf does Avery Bradley have a 0/0/0 and game worst +/- -25 in 20 minutes
"Fuck, Avery Bradley back in Lakers again? I was hoping he'd be in Warriors"
"Time to retire the Snell one. He hit a game winner on us last season, he's reformed  on the other hand, 8 more minutes than Avery Bradley is a bit of an accomplishment"
Why did they ignore Avery Bradley when he was wide open at the top of the key? Lol.
Doris: great hustle effort tonight from Avery Bradley.
Avery Bradley got his daily cardio in.
[Avery Bradley with the rare 0/0/0/0/0/-25 in 20 minutes](https://twitter.com/joeylinn_/status/1451769607916703746?s=21)
avery bradley hmmm
Avery Bradley literally just doing cardio out there
Avery Bradley is also notable you jerks at ESPN!
"There was a time a couple seasons ago when the pistons started the season pretty strong with a lineup of Reggie, Avery Bradley, Tobias, Drummond I think and there was legit talk of Drummond as a high post passer lol.   The dude can drop a dime once in a while."
"Dirk also didn't shy away from backing that German ass up when working in the post. He always had the fadeaway to fall back on, but he could work inside too (especially after 2005-2006 or so when iirc Avery Johnson urged him to develop more post up game).  KP reminds me more of Shawn Bradley. Too easy to push him around, and he doesn't seem to have Dirk's athleticism or lower body strength."
you can have him if you give us Baze and Avery Bradley back
I think Avery Bradley was the better keep tbh but hope he works out for yall
Avery Bradley had 6 points in 8 minutes off the waiver wire with a non guaranteed contract. How much will he be missed?
This is what they got Avery Bradley for. Hopefully he'll be in there with Westbrook instead of Rondo.
Shhhh.  It's like when Avery Bradley let Book score 70.
"GP2 actually costs them a little more, i think.  GP2 has some gauranteed money, AB has no details like that noted about his contract, i guess, means he can be cut whenever and he just gets paid whatever the prorated portion of his contract is...?  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/avery-bradley-6901/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/gary-payton-ii-20272/"
"LeBron is just a player, that's why you have a GM, it's the Lakers fault if they give him too much power in the decisions.   Curry and Green wanted to go win now mode, front office said nah, they and Andre wanted Avery Bradley, FO said nah   Hell, Curry wanted Mark Jackson to stay, players don't always know what's best"
Avery Bradley was literally the lakers best perimeter defender during their championship season. His absence in the bubble was one of the main reasons people through the clippers would beat the lakers if they matched up in the WCF
Where?  Russ is an awful off-ball defender and at best he's serviceable on-ball.  Dwight has gotten into foul trouble for years now even as a backup because he gets caught out of position a lot when he's not at the rim protecting it (like a pnr)  Avery Bradley hasn't been healthy in years so I'm not sure how /u/InternationalClik78 is incorrect with anything.
It all Comes down to the proper system. Just look At avery Bradley
"Avery Bradley fits well, Tim Hardaway Jr. may fit better. My point is Klay fits the best."
How you gonna talk about not knowing basketball and then saying every PG sucks horribly at defense except two games and have Avery Bradley of Jrue fuckin Holiday
Hard to argue against the Lakers with that youth infusion they got with Avery Bradley.
"It’s how The Lakers lost imo.  As a Warriors fan, The Lakers will be good.  They will bully teams on certain nights.  But where they may struggle is defensively.  Hard to see the older guys chasing around a team that can spread you 5 out.  Which is exactly what happened last night with Bjelicia playing the 5.  Also, Lakers obviously need more spacing.  Relying on Bazemore, Carmelo, Avery Bradley, Rondo, even LeBron to be your 3 pt shooters is not going to get it done.  They got a lot of work to do.  But I’m assuming they’ll be okay.  If anything, a guy like KCP and even freaking Kuzma who can play big and spread the floor might have helped the spacing issue.  Warriors, on the other hand, may be better than expected once Klay comes back.  I can see both of these teams in the WCF, if all healthy"
"They look so thin lmao. When melo, Avery Bradley, and bazemore are getting as many minutes as they are, you know you’re in trouble lol"
i always forget how good steph is even with that dribble like avery bradley was not stealing that shit
I’m not sure what it means for GSW or the Lakers that Avery Bradley was in with the closing lineup for the Lakers. Did GSW mess up by releasing him or do the lakers just not trust any of their other players yet? I think it says something that at the end of the night a guy the lakers signed two days ago is playing meaningful minutes.
"Yeah for real. Especially because they got Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn.  Nunn was a great fit at PG when paired with a ball dominant wing in Jimmy Butler. Nunn helped give Butler a rest in running the offense which is what Lebron wanted. Didn't need to boil the ocean by selling the farm for Westbrook.  Monk is a solid secondary ball-handler, and then you have Rondo off the bench. Lakers then get to keep their shooting depth.  Instead they've got Sekou Doumbaya, a looks-to-be-washed Avery Bradley, and whatever that other dude is on the bench."
"There was a lot of ball movement but it wasn't mindless ball movement which happens a lot in Warriors offense.   First thing is Bjelica utilizing Steph's gravity by faking the handoff with 2 defenders out of position. Notice he makes an accurate pass to Lee without looking which sets up enough time for Lee. Wiggins deserve more credit here for the offensive rebound.   Avery Bradley is smart and recovers quickly. Bjelica again sees Steph trapped at edge and sets a screen right away to free him. Steph with his usual gravity pulls 3 guys and only Bradley is attentive enough to see where Bjelica is going but too late. Bjelica made the right move to cut here as it's perfect for Draymond's passing angle. Then makes ANOTHER no look pass after a fake to Wiggins, again buying time for another quality shot. If Wiggins missed this I would have been pissed but he redeemed himself this 4th quarter. Ball movement is useless unless you know how to draw 2 defenders and utilize the spacing available. Bjelica has that next level understanding."
"Ah yes, the Lakers big 3. Lebron, AD, and Avery Bradley."
Avery Bradley needs to have a guaranteed contract!!!
Bosh was 100x better than this version of Westbrook. Avery Bradley outplayed Westbrook despite only playing 5 minutes.
"Fucking Avery Bradley looking like the second coming of Klay Thompson tonight, unironically."
Avery Bradley revenge game
Avery Bradley and Kent Bazemore both former Warriors came to play.
I think they brought in Avery Bradley way too late. He gels well with Russ and Rondo. Plus he's a good defender for the second unit. This team is so guard heavy. They are gonna have to make some tough decisions to get the rotations cohesive. Russ always starts slow so I'll give him some time
Avery Bradley needs to start.    Him and Bradley is a nice defensive back court.   I typically don’t care about Westbrook’s terrible performance tonight. I’ll wait till all star break at least to see how he fits on the team.
Big 3 = Bron AD and Avery Bradley
"FUCK OFF AVERY BRADLEY.  I wish Lakers get the taste of what they were trying to do to Curry (tripping), Lee (punching), Poole (elbowing) in the coming games."
"Westbrook’s bad handles and touch around the rim is concerning. Also no more Rondo and Westbrook please   Play Monk and Avery Bradley more, excited to see what Nunn and THT contribute."
Poor Avery Bradley. Went from contenders to pretenders in a week.
Avery Bradley is the 3rd best player on this team.
"LMAO avery bradley with that ""fuck the warriors"" foul"
So KCPS corner 3s from the last few years are now Bazemore and Avery Bradley. Yikes
Avery Bradley has as many points as Westbrook.
Glad Avery Bradley got a chance to showcase his talent. He kept getting waived and I thought people had given up on him.
Avery Bradley revenge game
is avery bradley cut from warriors gonna be a storyline?
"Holy Avery Bradley, is a legend"
Avery Bradley&gt;Russ
I love Avery Bradley

Avery bradley expertly finding the gap
"Holy shit, Avery Bradley just got himself a rotation spot now. Might even start him next game lol"
Avery Bradley has given the Lakers a nice spark
Bro wait where have I been when the fuck did we get Avery Bradley and why the fuck hasn’t he been in til now?!
Revenge game for Avery Bradley
Damn they needed Avery Bradley lol
"Stepped away for a few minutes, did WB get benched for Avery Bradley?"
Avery Bradley setting the fucking tone on defense. Not bad from a washed up vet

"Avery Bradley, boiiiii!"
Avery Bradley is different in a Lakers uniform
Avery Bradley revenge game!
Damn this looks terrible. The only solution for this is to suspend DJ and Avery Bradley for the rest of the season imo. The league needs to step in here u/NBA
Deandre Jordan and Avery Bradley
"Waive Avery Bradley and DeAndre, Lakers. It's overdue."
ill take bum ass Avery Bradley over Chiozza bum ass.....
Reminder : Avery Bradley is effectively Caruso replacement on the Lakers this year.  While Caruso was Avery Bradley's substitute on the bubble lakers year
I remember when Avery Bradley was washed up like 4 years ago lol
I was never a fan of this Avery Bradley signing....its pretty clear bro is very limited in what he can actually produce
The secret of Avery Bradley is that he was always awful.
"When Avery Bradley transferred the crown onto Lebron James' head he lost all of his powers. The #WashedKing feeds on the souls of ring chasing veterans to sustain himself, draining them of all remaining NBA talent. Avery Bradley didn't have much left so undoubtedly the Lakers will need to sign someone at the trade deadline if Lebron has any hope for completing the season. God rest his soul"
"Alright let me spell this out for you...   1. Teams do not do comprehensive film sessions for every game in the regular season, it just doesn't make sense. Nor does every single player watch the film they have. A lot of the time the film is really mostly for the coaches. You can tell this is the case by the way players talk about watching film. Which leads to...  2. If they do watch film the film they do watch is very, very simplified. They have an entire staff doing this. What are the star player's tendencies, what are the general schemes to look out for, etc. Big picture stuff. The film that a player is going to watch across a regular season is not going to reveal anything about how Avery Bradley is doing in 2021 compared to 2016."
"Players tend to over-value veterans in general. A name like ""Avery Bradley"" calls to mind all his highlight plays in the past, but in reality he hasn't been capable of doing those things for a long time."
Didn't you hear? Kemba and Avery Bradley are the worst players to ever play the game
We all know [why LeGM chose Avery Bradley](https://youtu.be/HtfbV52MNLk).
"Avery Bradley was so good two seasons ago before the bubble. But he's one of the liabilities we literally cannot play any minutes. Him, Dwight, Jordan, Rondo. Not great!"
"Wouldn't say players can't judge talent, more like they can't predict the exact system fit for the player that the coach has in mind. Avery Bradley may well be a better all-round player than GP2, but Kerr wanted someone who could play energetic lockdown defense, work as a small ball center, get a few rebounds and steals etc. for 12-15 mins a night, and GP2 is perfect for that role."
"It's decent for the best players because they are capable of carrying a team, for role players you need something like BPM that accounts for the players they share the floor with.  Hilariously, Avery Bradley has *never* had a positive box plus-minus lmaooo"
"\+/- is a fake stat. what would be more telling is his +/- stats with lebron and AD on the floor alongside Avery Bradley. if the lakers bench is as awful as most ppl seem to think, it is rather predictable that his +/- would be negative. i will concede however that the value is large."
Avery Bradley does not know how to space the floor or provide motion for the play. Westbrook will swing to the corner and Avery Bradley will stand outside the arc 5 feet from Westbrook and ball watch silently while providing no sense of positioning for AD or Dwight or whoever. The dude does not know how to perform within a basketball play.

Avery Bradley is 2 years older than Gary Payton II
"TBF on that point, I generally agree with them.   But Avery Bradley was never a high IQ basketball player to begin with."
Kemba and Avery Bradley are setting records one game at a time
Avery Bradley is who Russell Westbrook thinks Patrick Beverly is
&gt;This is also just a complete misrepresentation of Bradley on the Celtics  The tradition of people overvaluing his defense because it looked cool how he moved his feet and how his teams never actually being better with him on the court was at its peak in Boston actually. [This is actually a good article on his issues](https://www.celticsblog.com/2016/12/19/13994518/state-of-the-boston-celtics-is-avery-bradley-an-elite-defender) never could get over screens well after shoulder surgery and functionally the things he was good at like isolation defense and moving his feet just arent particularly important in the grand scheme of NBA defense. Youre basically describing yourself as the exact type of person who fell for the con.
Avery Bradley - OUT (Sleepin With The Fishes)
"seems like their biggest problem right now is team defense, AD can give you stretches of DPOY caliber work but he struggles to put together complete games at that level especially when he's also carrying a large offensive burden  carmelo is carmelo he's never gonna be a good defender  westbrook is a very flawed defender, he can do some good stuff off ball but he can also kill you by losing his assignment and ballwatching  and lebron has honestly been dogging it on defense this year when he does play, he's earned the right to take it easy in the regular season but he's still a negative on that end  avery bradley is generally solid at least and can be trusted to take big minutes  dwight howard gives them by far the most consistent defensive effort night to night but I suppose it's unclear how many minutes he can play per game  deandre is deandre"
"""avery bradley can be a great piece for any contending squad"""
"Unfortunately, Griffin is having an atrocious season.  The people in the league who are having a season like his are Bazley, Killian Hayes, Avery Bradley, Jalen Suggs, Porter Jr., and Jalen Green.  I mean, Theis lost his job with the Rockets who don't seem to be trying to win much and he's probably been slightly better than Griffin.  Despite winning, the Nets might have even been better without Griffin's minutes."
Same with Avery Bradley. Waived by the Warriors. Starts for the Lakers.
he was replaced by avery bradley who isn't doing anything better
"Oh lord, hello lottery, you’re welcome Pels.  Avery Bradley is one of the best perimeter defenders on the team and that is a fucking painful sentence to write since he’s *SO* rough on offense."
I remember watching a video on Avery Bradley guarding Steph curry and he explains that you throw all the fundamentals you’re taught out the window. Example being when your off ball on defense you’re supposed to be in between your man in the basket but Bradley explained he’d stay behind curry(or on his right hip/shoulder) to get over the screens quicker. Jrue Holiday also said something similar about have to guard him so differently.
I'm glad the debate over whether we should have kept Avery Bradley is thoroughly settled
god im so glad we cut avery bradley
Payton is a perfect example of why a competent GM is essential and how player influence over lineups and personnel can end poorly. The players wanted Avery Bradley over Payton but Payton is clearly more impactful on the court. Bradley is a great on ball isolation defender but Payton has the edge in pretty much every other defensive aspect.
"This kind of logic is always garbage.  Team you don't like wins by a small margin ? ""oh look at these few cherry picked things that went well for them and they still barely won""  Team you like loses by a small margin ? ""oh look at these few cherry picked things that didn't go their way and they still barely lost""  Every fanbase does this after every playoff game and it's just dumb.  Avery Bradley, Melo and Monk combined for 1-17 shooting, how often is that going to happen ?"
"Avery Bradley is fucking garbage , I don't know why he's got big minutes, literally playing 4 v 5 on one side and he's not even that great of a defender"
You think Avery Bradley would move off ball a little bit more cause of him being close to being cut
Im just here to see Avery Bradley place an invisible crown on Lebrons head and then Lebron grab him by the waist in a sensual way while their lips get uncomfortably close
"Avery Bradley was #1 above John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins in high school. Looked almost never gonna make the league at Texas. But he still out here, making NBA paychecks.   Kevin Porter Jr for the Rockets comes to mind as well.   There's a lot of these actually"
"A few years ago Avery Bradley always played him well. Right now I’d say FVV, but right now he’s just about unguardable"
Which team is a better question. When teams play box and one against you no single defender can stop you. As far as individual defenders go Dillon Brooks does a good job and Chris Paul always turns it up against Curry. Seth Curry and Avery Bradley also do pretty well. Jrue is typically a good defender but Steph always lights him up.
"Steph said Avery Bradley was a tough guard. But honestly it’s not a single player, it’s a team defense  that slows him down. Raptors applied the Box and 1, that was the best way to slow him down. The problem is it takes players buying into the defensive scheme for it to work"
"You think drafting Curry wasn't a risk when our star was an undersized Guard? Monta literally said it was a bad fit and wouldn't work.   Warriors then traded Monta for Bogut (who couldn't stay on the floor) to the enragement of the whole fan base, and bet on not 1 but 2 injury prone players, later rehabbing Livingston and swaying Andre to join.   Even after all the right moves the team still wasn't good enough, and even tho Steph was the star of the team, and he WANTED Jackson to stay, the front office said fuck that and got Kerr and the rest is history.   Then after KD left they had the balls to trade for Wiggins (seen as the worst contract in the league and a bust), knew to withhold Steph from coming back and sitting Green to guarantee a lottery pick.   And after putting an atrocious roster together they were smart enough not to double down and got rid/let walk Oubre, Wanamaker, EP, Manion, Mulder, Smailagic, etc. As well as picking GP2 when their their stars wanted Avery Bradley, and rounding the roster with Bjelica, OPJ, and Andre, as well as taking the risk with their picks instead of going full win now mode.   Warriors have taken A LOT of risk through their run"
Their best perimeter defender is probably a washed up Avery Bradley. That's a roster problem not a fixable one.
"There have been 4 players in the rotation that might not play at all on 20 other teams, including 2 starting (DJ, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, Wayne Ellington) The NBA is a star centric league but it doesn't mean the other guys aren't important, especially on the defensive side. What makes matters worse is that the team in general just doesn't really fit together, the lack of complimentary pieces means no one is really in their ideal role. Even LeBron and AD have to play outside of themselves to make up for the teams deficiencies"
"Besides the obvious problems (DJ is complete ass, Russ is a terrible fit with this roster, Melo and Monk can't defend anyone in the league) they have other big-time issues.  Avery Bradley, Rondo, Kent Bazemore, and Wayne Ellington have played a ton of minutes and all of them look totally cooked.  LeBron looks older than he ever has. AD looks disinterested for stretches. THT looks overmatched in his role more often than not.   This is not a roster that's going to win 4 playoff series. And I have no idea how to fix it."
"Both are slightly below average.   They are just a top heavy, depth-poor team.  You get out of Russ, Brow, Melo, and LeBron and it quickly goes to shit. Avery Bradley and Bazemore have been awful. THT is not doing well this year. Rondo is washed up."
Somewhat but you don't have to follow them. Steph and Dray I heard wanted to keep Avery Bradley. Instead the FO decided on GP2 aka clamps aka dontdribbleinfrontofme.
"&gt;2 free-throw for a guy who drives all night long proves that.  Less than half of his shots were in the paint, he was taking lots of jumpers.   I looked through each of his shots and saw [one](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=857&amp;GameID=0022100291&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Fox%204%27%20Driving%20Layup&amp;sct=plot), maybe [two](https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?GameEventID=711&amp;GameID=0022100291&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;flag=1&amp;title=MISS%20Fox%203%27%20Driving%20Finger%20Roll%20Layup&amp;sct=plot) that could be called as fouls. That second one looked pretty weak though, I'd probably say just one extra foul, and even that one might have actually been a block by Avery Bradley."
"Imagine someone told you a team with Lebron, AD, Westbrook, Melo, Deandre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Rondo, Trevor Ariza and Avery Bradley lost to the Kings"
It’s why getting reeves+nunn back will be huge. Not because they’re stars but because Avery Bradley is that fucking bad
Vogel starting DJ and Avery Bradley when 95% of the team is healthy is why he's on the hot seat
"Mine is Avery Bradley, but I guess it's not his fault he's playing so many minutes."
"I think he’s defense is a bit overrated personally, similar to like Avery Bradley in some ways. People see a guy like bothering a good perimeter player and lose their minds about it. I do think he can do more offensively than he gets credit for and I really like his cutting for a player who is going to be almost exclusively off ball on a good team."
"Sorry but THT is untouchable. Lakers best offer is Westbrook, Avery Bradley and a bag of Lays potato chips."
You’ve gotta be crazy if you think either of those two are the worst.   Cory Joseph Darius Bazley Avery Bradley
"Avery Bradley, Kilian Hayes or Deandre Jordan"
"He's still one of the Lakers' best perimeter defenders. And yes, that says much more about the Lakers than it does Avery Bradley."
He never just took 3s. He takes a shit ton of pull up mids - always has. It's what drags down his efficiency because he sucks at getting to the line or the rim.    I don't really buy his defense being better either. He's the classic case of someone that looks great on defense but doesn't actually have an impact. Like Avery Bradley.   Hell your defense is drastically worse with him on the floor so clearly it doesnt mean much.
AVERY BRADLEY
I’d take Jalen Green over Avery Bradley
"Avery Bradley.  I saw on here a while back that he was objectively the worst NBA player by most metrics, and somehow he has started 14 games."
Bamba is not in the running? Maybe Avery Bradley Dwight Powell or Harkless excluding under 24 guys
"It's a wonder our defense is as good as it is with 5 of our 9 man rotation being 35, 34, 34, 32, and 32 years old (Gay, Conley, Ingles, Bojan, Whiteside).   That's almost as geriatric as the Lakers' rotation. Of the 13 players who have gotten 200-ish minutes this season, their have a 33, 37, 31, 32, 37, 34, 36, 33, and 35 year old (Westbrook, Melo, Avery Bradley, Bazemore, LeBron, Ellington, Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan, and Rondo). In their expected 8 man lineup for playoffs, assuming they make it, I'd expect at least Westbrook (33), Melo (37), LeBron (37), Dwight (36), Ellington (34), and maybe Bradley (31) or Rondo (35).  We're not quite *that* old, but getting there."
"Thanks for cutting Avery Bradley, btw. Lakers really appreciate it."
"Westbrook was the problem at the start but he's been pretty good in the last 10/12 games.  AD is slightly below expectations, Lebron has been hurt.  But also, should we be surprised that a team starting a guy who couldn't make the Warriors roster and a guy who was cut by the Nets is struggling ?  The roster is a bit problematic, and they have had a lot of injuries (even washed Ariza and Nunn would probably help), but Vogel has been pretty bad too, like it's 2021, Avery Bradley has had one good defensive season since 2017 and it was 2020 when he was playing in an ELITE defensive team that covered his weakness. I'm not even sure he's above average on defense. Jordan probably isn't even a better defensive player than Melo at this point."
"It always seems to me a strange genre of discussion forum comment to say that it’s not a good sign that a team won when such-and-such player played well. Imagine for example that LeBron played crappy and the lakers won on an amazing performance by DeAndre Jordan, or Avery Bradley, or anybody else. Then the response would be, “it's not a good sign that the Lakers won on a great game by DeAndre Jordan because he is obviously not going to keep that up.”  That's the nature of the game — players play better and worse on different nights. It's almost guaranteed  that, on any night, some of your players will play above their norm and other below it."
"This team can very clearly play good basketball with Westbrook. The biggest problem inflicting the Lakers is depth. We have about 4 players on the bench who are huge liabilities and can barely play any minutes, Avery Bradley isn't good defensively like he was two seasons ago, Malik Monk had a disastrous final minute and OT, Melo is Melo so that's not too bad but sometimes it can be. This bench needs improvement."
I just wish OP played the clip long enough for the Avery Bradley crowning!
Because shit talking Avery Bradley just doesn’t feel as good.
Avery Bradley whipping out the crown.   Y’all know what time it is.
Avery Bradley crowning LeBron    *chefs kiss*
Avery Bradley is tricking you
"Honestly Austin reaves. He’s better than Caruso was as a rookie. Shot blocker would obviously be Dwight. On ball defender for small guards Avery Bradley, but all around it has to be reaves"
"Avery Bradley, no competition"
Avery Bradley
DAJ - DeAndre Jordan. AD - Anthony Davis. AB - Avery Bradley. THT - Talen Horton-Tucker.  Why Lakers getting all the nicknitials...OP must be from ESPN.  /s
"DAJ? I didn't know if that was weird comment on the center position like Dwight Anthony and Jordan. He was known by just DJ in his clipper days but he can't be the whole reason the lakers defense is bad he doesn't play that many minutes.  We have so many minimum players, Carmelo never plays D, avery bradley was cut this year. I keep hoping Lebron with fix this but this is a bad team we may lose so much it doesn't matter. Last year i was hoping we could repeat cause we had the Suns lined up but injuries and age finished that and we got older. Vogel is trying, who do you want to coach Fizdale?"
it's hard to keep him on the floor when he can't knock down shots which he hasn't done on a consistent basis and the opposing defense continues to exploit him on defense (or offensively when Avery Bradley forced Kemba to turn the ball over at halfcourt multiple times when he brought up the ball). Also we signed him with the intention of him splitting minutes with D Rose and IQ for about 20-25 minutes each and more depending on who plays better at games.
"I’m not fan of the Lakers, but this team has too much talent to be this bad for the whole season. They are going to turn it around and will play better, but it’s hard to imagine they are going to be the favourites when the playoffs start.   Russ is starting to play better and smarter, AD with even all the critics is playing really good and it’s hard to imagine him playing that much better. LeBron is not playing even remotely good, but it’s the same story for years with him at the start of the season.   The problem with this team is their defence. I think they have enough shooters to surround LeBron, but their defence is awful and it’s hard to imagine that it will get good enough for consistent stops when the playoffs come.   You can trust AD, but LeBron at his current age can go from lockdown defence on one position to awful to the next if he’s getting fatigued. Westbrook at his best is an average defensive player. Melo if you have him on the floor is a bad defensive player with this lineup. And if you have Avery Bradley at the end of the game it means that A. He’s playing great B. You have no other options. The other option for finishing the game is THT over someone like Bradley or Melo, but then you have some size issues."
Avery Bradley and Deandre Jordan would like a word
Wrong night to comment this one bro. Doubt you’ll get upvoted after he and Avery Bradley were the only people getting it done for the Lakers tonight.
Everyone else except Avery Bradley in all honesty
Would you rather a stone cold Melo or stone cold Monk or stone cold AD or completely iced out THT shoot the three? How about Avery Bradley who was shivering in the 4th? Westbrook was legit one of our better shooters tonight.   Y’all reduce the whole game to one play to shit on Westbrook lol.
What in the actual fuck was that pass by Avery Bradley.......
Avery Bradley best Laker
As a token of appreciation of taking Bazemore and Avery Bradley (and not GP2)?
"Holy shit, the Lakers are looking atrocious. No offense at all, AD settling for long 2s, Avery Bradley and THT taking 30 footers. Then they double on Kemba and leave Randle completely open for a three.  Now they leave Fournier open to take a shot right before the buzzer. They're making the Knicks look like the Warriors right now lol."
they running Bron and Avery Bradley
I mean Lakers started Avery Bradley Kent Ad and Dj all at the same time next to russ. Kd Joe and Mills alone make up for those lineups
"No, not really.  Rebouding is defense. The Lakers had three players with at least 9-10 rebounds last night ---including DeAndre who grabbed 9 boards in his 12mins of action. Avery Bradley finished with a +19 for the game, and helped hold DET starting guards to a combined 27% shooting on the night/17% on 3pt shots."
Is Avery Bradley a player from the 1970's?
is that supposed to be Malik Beasley or Avery Bradley
"Adding Bjelica as a big man helped their 3pt shooting and spreading the floor. The dude can playmake as well. Iggy coming back has been a revival for the dude. He’s playing a lot better than when he was in Miami. He’s still hitting the occasional 3, he knows the system, and he’s still a decent defender. While GP2 has been phenomenal and definitely better than picking up Avery Bradley. Aside from the dunks, he’s been shooting 3s more consistently. His defense is some of the best in the league right now. Full court press on the ball handler, contesting every shot and helping with rotations, plus playing passing lanes and getting steals with his hops. OPJ is a bit injury prone but has worked well with the Warriors so far. Kuminga is looking like a good wing defender and driver. While he is average from the 3, he is still a rookie and developing. He comes off the bench with a lot of energy and can only get better.  And these are just the additions to the team. The home grown talent like Lee, Poole, and Looney have been showing his stuff as well. Looney has been stepping with his defensive skills and great footwork. Watch the Nets game where he defends Harden if you wanna see his defense. Lee has always been a great bench player than can hit 3s and drive to the rim. Not to mention his chemistry with the team. And Poole has become the second option for the team with his playmaking and shooting 3s. He’s also flourishing in the Kerr motion offense. Even if Klay comes back, Poole is going to be a great asset starting until Klay gets back into the line up or being the leader off the bench.   Then you have Wiggins and Green. Wiggins has been has been emerging in the Warriors system. It just creates so many opportunities for everyone to shoot and play make that it drives defenses crazy. Wiggins looks like a different guy on the Warriors, idk if the culture was bad in Minnesota or he didn’t like the team. But now? He’s a different dude.   And what’s there to say about Draymond Green? He is part of that system and knows when to set screens, pin downs, pick and rolls, when to roll to the basket, handoffs. It’s stuff that doesn’t stuff the stat sheet but is important to the Warriors offense. On defense he is the leader and no one disputes that. He can tell when the other team about to make a switch, where they will shoot, and when to drive. He’s always communicating with his team and he covers for them if they miss an assignment. His game against KD is a masterclass on why he’s one of the best defenders in the league.   But the whole reason they are doing a lot better is the players in the roster understand the Warriors system. They got rid of guys like Paschal and Oubre jr who didn’t really fit the Warriors scheme. You can see now the Warriors team are playing like how they used to in the Strength in Numbers days. Everyone is active on offense: setting screens, pin downs, handing off, freelance running and cutting to the rim. It’s a lot for any defense to cover and it’s why Curry can get open so often."
I got slightly worried when Avery Bradley nailed a couple of 3s
Avery Bradley is single-handedly killing us in the 4th. Wtf man...
Avery Bradley would reach a lot with the lakers too.  Has had this problem his entire career probably.
"Miami and Washington structured around Beal for Herro, Duncan, Andre, Avery Bradley, and Harkless, with a third team incentivized to take harkless and bradley's money. Miami gets beal, Washington gets two shooters that Russ may fit better with?"
"&gt; he traded them all away for Kyrie  Avery Bradley wasn't traded for Kyrie, he was traded to Detroit for Marcus Morris.   &gt; Remember how this sub treated the trade when it first broke out?  Are you trying to claim that with hindsight we should all feel like that was a good trade for the Celtics? Wouldn't you guys rather have Jae Crowder and Colin Sexton right now instead of having nobody? What did Kyrie do for Boston to make it seem like the consensus should be that that was a great trade for the Celtics? If anything I think hindsight shows that was a disaster."
"Yeah but that was the same for Jaylen. According to the advanced stats, we were better with rookie Jaylen (despite all his hiccups) than we were with Avery Bradley. As fans we spent the season calling for more minutes.   But what the team was doing, was benching him so his mistakes wouldn't overwhelm him. He makes a mistake, gets benched and thinks about that one mistake. If he makes a mistake and keeps playing, all those mistakes merge into one incoherent mess.   Now what we're seeing is that Jaylen (when healthy) is really precise. He's very quick to act and he's efficient with his dribble. He gets the ball and it's a snap decision, a snap movement, an efficient possession.  We also saw Brad Stevens do the same with Rob Williams. He's always been an amazing impact player but the team spent the 1st two years just pushing him to improve his fundamentals. He's still got work to do, but his improvement has been really good."
"I think that mostly has to do with the context in which the incidents came to light.  There was no 4k recorded livestream of avery bradley or kendrick nunn committing their crimes. The internet is a lot more entertained when they can visually see something.   It's not really a surprise that the Meyers Leonard thing garnered far more attention when it's a short digestible clip that can be shared on all social media platforms, in comparison to an article that happens far after the fact.  This is pretty much true for anything on the internet, it being a racial slur is not really relevant. Pretty sure it would've blown up even more if it were anything more reprimandable than the use of a slur."
"if you ask directly, yeah, but obviously the 2 situations mentioned never became a big deal, i never remember anyone talking about cancelling avery bradley or kendrick nunn. media usually doesn’t make it a big deal unless it fits their narrative. this is not a “you can’t say anything these days” comment at all as i don’t condone what leonard said and he deserves his criticism."
"Remember that post about the fucking Avery Bradley trade, the most standard trade on par with like, 80% of other trades, about how evil Ainge is for trading away poor Avery Bradley?"
No you replied to my question which was:  &gt;why  In response to another user that  said:  &gt;surprised he's on a team at all after the bubble last year tbh  Avery bradley wasnt even in the bubble.  And plenty of players opted out of the bubble and now play in the league.   I was curious why someone would think that.
His criminal charges were dropped because he paid a settlement and agreed to a public apology. He wouldn’t have agreed to a public apology (see Avery Bradley had he not believed to have been completely innocent/consensual.  This kind of victim shaming mentality is what’s causing less victims to come out with their story.
"It's because Nike and the NBA aren't pushing Bradley as an icon, so basically yes, it's because he was better at putting the ball through the hoop, and because a lot of money depends on people associating him with the Mamba Mentality and not sexual assault. Nowhere near as much money is riding on Avery Bradley's name and reputation."
"&gt;Detroit Pistons guard Avery Bradley reportedly reached a settlement with a woman who alleged he sexually assaulted her in May, according to TMZ Sports. **Bradley reportedly denied the accusations, but decided to pay the woman ""to prevent false information from being made public.""**  &gt; The woman, who is a reality television star, said Bradley sexually assaulted her while she was passed out due to being drunk.  &gt;Bradley's attorney, Brian Wolf, released the following statement regarding the matter:  &gt;""Mr. Bradley absolutely denies having engaged in wrongdoing whatsoever. The confidentiality agreement specifically refutes and denies the validity of all allegations of any wrongful conduct by Mr. Bradley. The sole purpose of the agreement was to protect the reputation and privacy of Mr. Bradley and his family.  Huh...he may have prevented the details from being leaked but the pertinent/damaging information is already out there. Seems like the smart thing to do would’ve been to try and clear his name."
Damn didn't know that about Avery Bradley.

"DeSean was still considered a deep threat with enough speed to take the top off of defenses. He still had a desired skill set.   My point is that expecting sport leagues to have consistency when it comes to this type of stuff is a bit idealistic, imo. Social justice and legal justice aren't what they care about -- it's all about public perception. Ray Rice and Colin Kaepernick and Avery Bradley should show that well enough, imo."

"Avery Bradley was a top 6 SG in 2016, Beal wasnt"
Is Avery Bradley toast now? I’m only a casual nba fan but last time I remember hearing much about him he was solid
"avery bradley beal\* lol  avery bradley's defense was really good in his prime, doesn't have kawhi's size or hands but he was really smart and annoying with it - he was just small"
Bruh   Comparing Beal and Avery Bradley at any point in there careers is blasphemous.
"nah, I think the Lakers have set their sights on bringing Avery Bradley back, and you just lost a forward in Kuzma. Shot 40% from 3 last season, 36% in his career, and he's tall AF which is exactly what Vogel wants. If, and it's a pretty big if, but if Schroder can be S&amp;T to Chicago for Lauri, that's probably the biggest W the Lakers could have hoped to get out of the situation. Bradley fits, knows how to play the way Vogel wants already, and is a pretty good defender to make up the loss of KCP."
I forgot Avery Bradley was even in the league still
Avery Bradley is only good defensively against a certain type of player. Guys that are around his size or smaller.  He's not going to offer much against other types.
"Lmao what?  Avery Bradley was one of the best guard defenders in the league, if not, the best"
Except he's actually a bad defender  He's like Avery Bradley - looks like he's a great defender but is actually below average because he sucks at literally everything but on ball guard defense and can't switch.  And on ball guard defense is about the least valuable skill out there since all it takes is a simple pick to make them useless
"Jeff Green, Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley?  Are Brandon Bass and Tyler Zeller available too??"
"So we traded for Al Horford, want to sign Jeff Green, Avery Bradley, and Kelly Olynyk?   Anyone know what Antoine Walker and Eddie House are up to?"
"I would rather have Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley &amp; Jeff Green."
Javale McGee  Lance Stephenson  Rondo  Dwight Howard  Marc Gasol  Dennis Schroder  Avery Bradley  Danny Green  Jared Dudley  Montrezl Harrel  Quinn Cook  JR Smith  Dion Waiters  Tyson Chandler  Andre Drummond  Russell Westbrook  Potentially Carmelo and Iguodala  It's like a kid playing 2K
Avery Bradley too
"Brad brought a starting line up of Smart, Avery Bradley, Evan Turner, Jared Sullinger, Tyler Zeller to the playoffs. How many other coaches can do that?"
"Can’t wait to play the Lakers’ summer league team of Melo, Derozan, Patty Mills, Dwight and Avery Bradley"
"Along with Patty Mills, Avery Bradley, Rudy Gay, DeMar DeRozan, Nic Batum, Jeff Green, Reggie Bullock  Did i miss anyone"
Avery Bradley has a revenge to take with the Lakers. He did not participate in the title win on the bubble. He has to come back to really take his championship ring.
Avery Bradley is in the mix too isn't he
"I think the Lakers *do* have strong interest in Avery Bradley, just so long as he's OK with signing for a minimum."
How many years with Avery Bradley in the off-season is this now?
The return of Lakers GOAT Avery Bradley
Rockets legend Avery Bradley?
Clippers fan favorite Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley is not better than Alex Caruso lol
JJ Reddick or JR Smith will probably get a call Derrick Rose is also a free agent Avery Bradley
Hell i'll be nice and include avery bradley.
"Avery Bradley pre-bubble, even JaVale was there to buy minutes for AD and Dwight at the 5.  Kieff also stepped up when called upon.    If there’s anything I’ve learned over the years it’s that when it comes to the Lakers, “it won’t work” from fans of opposing teams is code for “we shook”."
"&gt;Who also shot 45% from 3  Depends a lot on if you believe this is real at all. He shot 28.8% and 32.4% his two other years, and was a 65.7% FT shooter over his career. He also only 22% from 25 feet and beyond, which is where he'll shoot from in the NBA.   At worst, he's a backup PG that can only play defense on opposing 1s and undersized 2s.   Like, there's not even anyone to compare him to because guys like Avery Bradley and Patrick Beverley have significantly longer wingspans at 6'7. Beverley's also a legit 3-point shooter.   To me, Davion Mitchell's upside is being a Patrick Beverley-type player, with the bust potential of barely being an NBA player if his shot is as bad as it could be."
"Just off the top of my head, guys who are vets and would ring chase for vet min (regardless of how likely). Lots of guys out there, its just about finding the handful needed to play alongside 3 hall of famers.  danny green  james johnson  reddick  millsap  Tucker  derrick rose  jamychal green  avery bradley  mike scott  enes kanter  javale  dwight  stan johnson"
"I’d say Boogie, Wall, PG, Hayward in no particular order over Favors for sure, and Bledsoe and Whiteside likely being over him as well. Other than those guys, the only other decent players are Aminu, Larry Sanders, Avery Bradley, J Lin, Lance Stephenson, and Boban"
"Their new lineup (if it stays) actually reminds me of your old days with IT, Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley all playing heavy minutes. Don’t think 3 guards is the right way to go personally."
Avery Bradley might be an option. Played well for us here.
"Danny green, kcp, Avery bradley, kieff.  I mean yeah they shot like shit but we had em 😂😂"
Jalen Green gonna quit if he's benched for Avery Bradley lmao
"Barely. Lakers as a team shot 34.9% in the regular season, and 35.4% from the playoffs mostly thanks to AD and Rondo not missing much.  But those 3&amp;D wing players?  KCP: 37.8%, down from 38.5% in the regular season.   Green: 33.9% on 5.5 attempts from 41.6% in the regular season.  Mind you Avery Bradley didn't even play."
"As a Celtics fan, I was fairly confident he was going to re-sign with OKC, but thought that if he left for ANYWHERE it would be Boston.  Didn't think he'd break the NBA by going to GS, and none of his other suitors seemed primed to win-now and win for the forseeable future as the Celtics did.  KD, Horford, Crowder, Smart, IT (or maybe Kyrie), Avery Bradley, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum.  Wouldn't have automatically been title favorites but it would've been a great team that could have competed with Lebron's Cavs to go to the Finals."
I get that he can play 4. But saying he’s a “4”implies it’s his natural position. It’s not imo. Al Horford is a 4 who plays 5. That isn’t what Hunter is. I get Hunter isn’t a Brad Beal/Avery Bradley size score or defender but to me his best position would be as combo guard alongside Trae
"Because Kuz isn't going to cut it and I think the Lakers want to keep THT.  It's amazing how Kuz has like 99 lives when it comes to trades (mostly because no one wants him).  Like, I have this nightmare that five years from now, he's still going to be on the Lakers last man standing.  He's survived onger than D'lo, Randle, BI, Zo, Hart and now a very real possibility that he'll last past KCP, THT, Carushow, Avery Bradley, Rondo, Dwight, and DS.  Unreal."
The Rockets turned James Harden into Kelly Olynyk and Avery Bradley
So Avery Bradley and Kelly Olynk and some picks we’re screwed
For real.  Even out of us in the Oladipo trade Houston got an expiring contract in Avery Bradley and the ability to swap our 1st round pick with the Nets first round pick (which is HOU's) next year.  It's nothing crazy but it's something for HOU.  I get Masai might have been trying to preach principle or something but I don't know what they had to lose by letting him go...dude will definitely go back in his final year or sign a 1 day contract with them to officially retire a Raptor.
Houston really chose Avery bradley and Kelly Olynyk who can both walk this offseason over Caris Levert and Jarett Allen lmao dumbass front office
"Well obviously they were doing well enough with LeBron at point, but it would be preferable if he started at SF instead of KCP and have Dennis start in the backcourt instead of Avery Bradley, like they did in 2019-20."
"Idk this is kind of subjective. If we are talking most important draft picks, Ainge “reaching” for Jaylen Brown at 3, and then trading back to get Tatum, is significantly more important than missing on late first round picks. People really overrate the average value of picks outside of the top 5-10- Kelly Olynyk was a great pick, so was Rozier, Marcus Smart was a great pick (weak draft), Avery Bradley also a good find way back when.  All of that being said, no matter how you slice it, other teams overall have drafted better given circumstances. Toronto comes to mind off the top- all of those guys are home grown/ drafted. GSW has also done very well, Heat seem to find some diamonds in the rough, I’m sure others I’m forgetting."
"I think they gotta go with 3 and D players like a Avery Bradley, Trevor Ariza and maybe bring back Wes Matthews. They also have to keep PJ.  They should go for a backup point guard. Maybe a guy like TJ McConnell if they can somehow get him 94 Rose. Both not the most realistic but possible if they wanna chase a ring like Bobby did."
"Washington State:  PG: Dejounte Murray  SG: Avery Bradley  SF: Zach Lavine  PF: Michael Porter Jr  C: Jaden McDaniels  Reserves:  Jaden McDaniels, Kevin Porter, Malachi Flynn, CJ Elleby, Jaylen Nowell, Joe Harris, Isaiah Thomas, Corey Kispert, Robert Franks, Paolo Banchero (Need some size).   Notes:  Michael Porter Jr only played senior year in Seattle so not sure if he really counts.   Avery Bradley played his senior year in Vegas but was at a prep school so I don’t really count it."
"Simmons, Thybulle, and 3 first rounders is better than Olynyk, Avery Bradley, and 4 first rounders.  And yeah a lot of the league wasn't going after him hard because Houston's dumb owner decided he was just gonna hold onto him until after the regular season started for no reason lmao.  [The Houston Rockets feel no pressure to trade James Harden or Russell Westbrook, regardless of the superstars' strong desire for fresh starts with different franchises, and are ""willing to get uncomfortable"" as training camp opens and the season begins, sources told ESPN.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30338326/sources-houston-rockets-willing-get-uncomfortable-james-harden-russell-westbrook)  💀💀💀 incompetent ass front office"
Avery Bradley in Boston. He could get low and has an insane wingspan
"Shoulda traded for Seth Curry, kept Dwight, hell even kept Avery Bradley"
Marcus Smart/Avery Bradley
"He doesn’t do it so much anymore, but I can only see this as an Avery Bradley steal."
Rondo sent the invite to Avery Bradley instead.
"they went from ""they gonna miss Avery Bradley, who's guarding Dame &amp; Harden"" to ""of course they won it was a cakewalk superteam"""
"I'd probably swap out Evan Turner for Avery Bradley for this squad.  Edit:   Or Eric Bledsoe, to be fair."
"&gt;They played a beat up, heat squad who traded away too many players for oladipo who didn't even play in the series. Super easy win  They were way more beat up in the Finals last year. Goran Dragic is their third best player and he didn't even play. Bam was playing through injury. They only traded Kelly Olynk for Oladipo who was on the team last year. Avery Bradley, the other guy the traded, didn't even play in the bubble. They also got Ariza.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Even with this massive stroke of luck it still took a ref destroying Traes ankle for them to win this series  Giannis got injured half a game later and didn't even finish the series. They still won.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then they managed to avoid the Lakers, Jazz, Clippers and Mavericks in the final  Jazz and Mavericks would not have beaten them. C'mon.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Then they managed to get lucky and avoid the 76ers.  What? 76ers team were not better than the Hawks.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Third best in the east maybe  Who's the 2nd best then?"
"Nah. I'm even more sick of people making excuses for us losing in the first round because of injuries. CP3 missed 1 game and left another. Exactly the same with AD. The series was completely even. We lost fair and square plainly because in game 6 LeBron quit on the team.  We should've and were perfectly capable of beating the Suns without Anthony Davis.  In the past two years, the Lakers, just by having LeBron, have not lost a *single* game because of a talent disparity. Every game the Lakers lost from the Anthony Davis era and onward has been because of effort. Hell we willed ourselves to victory multiple times while LeBron was hurt this season.   Also I know it's not your comment but how the hell did we ""blow up"" our team? Dwight, Rondo, and JaVale were the only guys we lost that played any meaningful minutes. Danny Green counts too I guess but he was easily replaceable. The only other guy I can think of, Avery Bradley, didn't even come to the bubble. The core of the team-- Bron, AD, KCP, Morris, Kuz, Caruso, THT, were all still there."
James harden for Kelly Olynk and avery Bradley
"I think they have to sign Bobby back, retain Forbes and PJ too. They need to add a 3 and D player with their MLE, someone who can impact their team right away.   A player like Avery Bradley, Trevor Ariza, or bring back Wes Matthews would do them well I feel like."
"2020 Lakers were a super team. Two top 10 players, good role players in Dwight Howard, Danny Green, KCP, Rondo, Carushow, and Kuzma (I don’t care what anyone says, he did what he needed to last year off the bench) then you still got guys like Morris, McGee who had some great games, and Avery Bradley who unfortunately couldn’t play in the playoffs. That’s a super team unless you consider needing a 3rd star to make it one"
"Acting like Lillard wouldn’t have made a difference in the series is hilarious. It just goes to show you can’t even have an objective conversation.   And again, if you didn’t catch it the fist time. Comparing Damian Lillard being injured to rondo and Avery Bradley is just pathetic. The Lakers played one healthy team all playoffs, those are facts."
"When Lillard got hurt the Lakers were already up 2-1 in the series and were up 92-56 in Game 4. Lillard was not going to help them win that game if he'd stayed healthy, and so they would have been down 3-1 after that game. There's no way the Blazers were coming back from down 3-1, not after they'd just been absolutely blown out of games 2 &amp; 4. And again, the Lakers were missing both Avery Bradley and Rondo in that series. Pretty tough when your starting and backup point guards aren't available."
"Lmao why did you delete your comment?   Here’s my reply to what you deleted  They traded dlo cause they weren’t happy with him. They literally said this. They did not like him. Magic literally went and trashed the dude in the media. It was also a full year before Lebron signed, they didn’t even need to do it then.   Lopez would’ve been amazing next to bron. What are you talking about. Do you see him next to giannis? Lopez can catch lobs. He’d also give you solid defense and can shoot three.   And I agree randle would be a bad fit next to bron. But they just let him go for nothing. I can’t see any team doing that. The clippers got back Tobias harris, Avery Bradley, boban, and a pick which they used on shai. You picked the worst example to make your point. That’s exactly why I’m saying they should’ve re-signed randle lol. You could’ve got back something…anything.    Don’t forget shai is what helped them get PG.   Which clippers signing fell flat this year? Batum, rondo, ibaka were amazing pickups. They got rid of Lou Williams too when they got rondo. Kawhi asked them to get smarter and that’s what they did. Kennard was a 40% shooter too, so idk why you acting like he’s trash. His contract is just ass."
Avery Bradley?! That’s that dude who quit on his team
Was avery Bradley on the warriors like 2 weeks ago or am I high as fuck lmao
now Avery Bradley comes in LMAO
Shit Avery Bradley is going to want some revenge lol
"No Ariza, Ellington, Nunn, THT…Avery Bradley if you want to count him. I’ll pass judgement after a bigger sample size…maybe 10 games."
Every time they pan to the Lakers bench I see another role player I didn't even know they had lmfao when the fuck did they get avery bradley
Unleash Avery Bradley cowards
"Weird to see Avery Bradley in Lakers suit, when a few days ago, he's right there on the Warriors side."
Yeah you guys got Avery Bradley instead
"Frank Vogel says Avery Bradley will be available for tonight's game. He says it's ""unlikely"" he will play because he's only done a walkthrough, but he can play if necessary."
"&gt;Why the Sixers should trade Simmons for Avery Bradley  That's insane.  I mean, Bradley just signed. You have to wait to make a trade."
Both of these things can be true… what’s your point?  I haven’t seen an r/NBA post saying “Here’s how the Sixers can definitely get Dame”. At least not in months.   Meanwhile there’s a new “Why the Sixers should trade Simmons for Avery Bradley” post about every five minutes…
"*clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game*  *ball is inbounded to Avery Bradley who turns face to face against Gary Payton II*  ""You took my contract""  *moves to the left*  ""You took my friends""  *moves to the right*  ""You took a deal that was guaranteed for me""  *clock winds down to 2*  ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR STEPH AND DRAYMOND""  *goes up, fire coming out of his shoes*  ""BESTORGANIZATIONFROMTOPTOBOTTOM""  *Ball flies over Payton's head, goes straight into basket.

https://twitter.com/YossiGozlan/status/1450207102794825728?s=20  Avery Bradley is on a non-guaranteed deal so it's possible the Lakers waive him once THT/Ariza/Nunn/Monk etc get healthy. It would cost the Lakers $7M in combined payroll and luxury tax expenses if Bradley becomes guaranteed [eg 2x10 days or lasts through to Jan ]

"&gt;Players are occasionally waived and are good on other teams.   Avery Bradley is an example of that. The Grizzlies waived him in 2019 and [the Lakers signed him](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1148274909455380483?t=R4lKRPG1T0P4kPgJY6Mb-Q&amp;s=19) and he was their starting PG all year until the bubble (which he didn't go to, because of his son). The Lakers were great with him that year, going 49-14 with him before the stoppage (that's a 64 win pace)."
Waiting for Avery Bradley to say the Lakers is one of the best orgs he has played for.
Avery Bradley lowered the Lakers average age. Think about that.
Nah Avery Bradley just wasn't good.
"Lakers gave Avery Bradley a tribute in a preseason game, just for them to get him back before the start of the regular season lmfaoo"
Welcome back Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley: warriors organization is pretty shit imo
"Laughable argument. Avery Bradley propels them to the greatest roster in league history. That’s, at the very least, 7 rings in a row."
Players are occasionally waived and are good on other teams. I’m not saying Avery Bradley is the case but I’m also not writing him off based on that fact alone.
"Buddy, Avery Bradley is at least three more rings"
It wasn't just avery Bradley. Ainge tried to trade ray to Memphis in 09 after the chip.
"Much of the Ray drama stems from the fact that he didn't want to play behind Avery Bradley, right? If your team wants you to play behind a guy who wasn't there when you signed your contract, you do it. If you don't want to, don't be surprised when they try to move you."
"And most of the moves made to win that chip wasn’t even thanks to genius thinking on his part:  1. Kyrie. The obvious No. 1 pick in his draft. Dan may be terrible, but even he isn’t that stupid to not pick him. Or that was what we thought until he picked Anthony Bennet 2 years later.   2. Love. A Love-Pick no. 1 (Wiggins) deal wasn’t some genius move Gilbert pulled out. It was already being discussed as a popular trade option the moment the Cavs won the first pick. All Dan had to do was to make the move.   3. Lebron. Cleveland is lucky as hell that this man was willing to come back after the shitshow they put him through. Dan Gilbert had *nothing* to do with this man coming back.   4. Supporting cast. Yes JR and Shumpert were good pickups but nothing too extraordinary. Tristan Thompson developed into a good starting C playing alongside one of the greatest playmakers of all time. Matthew Dellavedova wasn’t signed with “back-up PG on a championship team” mindset, so you can’t praise Dan for that.   And when you compare this to what the Lakers were able to do in the 2019 season alone, Gilbert pales in comparison. Signing guys like Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, and an *upgrade* in the head coaching staff, and resigning others like Alex Caruso was better than anything Dan Gilbert has accomplished over his 2 Lebron stints *combined.*"
I doubt its like that tbh vets probably love Avery Bradley
Wait Avery Bradley is only 30 years old? i thought he was like 35 or something
Jordan Poole wanted Avery Bradley?
Only 3 years older than Avery Bradley
Its a joke.  The year Booker dropped 70. Avery Bradley played excellent defense. So when the all nba defensive voting came out. Chris Broussard said he didn't vote for Bradley despite everyone thinking he should have won because he let Booker drop 70. But he didn't even play.
Steph is actually a huge fan and has a poster of Avery Bradley hanging over him and Ayesha's bed
"""Looks like his dad"" is a positive in Gary Payton II's scouting report. But when you see that in Avery Bradley's scouting report, it's generally a negative. Nobody remembers Avery Bradley Sr."
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-avery-bradley-makes-bold-claim-about-ball-defense
If keeping Avery Bradley we’re to be the straw that breaks the camels back for Steph or Dray then the Warriors would have bigger problems at hand I feel.
Wait Avery Bradley is only 30 years old? i thought he was like 35 or something
"Their ownership/GM has said so much shit to piss of their stars it doesn't matter especially Avery Bradley  If you listen to the players they love those type of players pesky on ball defenders, volume scorers etc, Jamal Crawford would still be in the league if players were asked"
"I highly doubt they're ""pissed off"" over Avery Bradley."
Luol Deng and Joakim Noah  Rudy Gay - just wasn't a star  Avery Bradley  Nene
"And lost Avery Bradley, who was good with the Lakers and the 3rd best player."
"they're all just going to the gleague.  the only guys they were seriously considering for the 15th spot was avery bradley, gp2, mychal mulder."
"Lakers [signed AB in the offseaso](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2844716-lakers-news-avery-bradley-to-sign-2-year-97m-contract-after-clearing-waivers)n, but he was injured starting out and then came back slowly. He wound up with the starting/closing spot and was playing more minutes  than AC when the league was shut down"
"&gt; I do gotta laugh at how the guy was in closing lineups all year the Lakers won a chip, he starts in pivotal game 6 of the final  Frickin Avery Bradley deciding to sit out the bubble  Leaving AC as the point guard defense.   Good on AC to step up"
reminder that avery bradley is 30
"Uhhh a starter and a HOFer’s son with his namesake. If you don’t know Jordan Bell you simply just didn’t watch the Warriors Superteam in the regular season, if you don’t know Mychal Mulder I don’t blame you, but if you don’t know Avery Bradley or Gary Payton you just don’t know basketball."
"Man, what the hell happened to Avery Bradley?  He was decent on that Lakers run 19/20 but after he opt out, it feels like he’s only been going down."
Avery Bradley was waived for Axel Toupane. Time for China.
"avery bradley, gary payton's son, and 2 guys i don't know"
damn you at least gotta recognize Avery Bradley😂
Agree except for that GPII part.  Dude just had hernia surgery and Avery Bradley has a lot of playoff experience.  It’ll come down to the wire
Avery Bradley too
The Avery Bradley saga was horrible. Favoritism that he even benched Patrick Beverly to still play Bradley who was underperforming. Then made every excuse for Bradley for Bradley to get traded and tell Memphis media that LAC used him wrong😂😂
He only played Shai because Front office traded Avery bradley away. So yes Avery bradley was getting mins over Shai.
Gary Payton II deserves a spot that Avery Bradley looks like he’s going to win
"We’ve seen regular season Rondo, Danny Green try to dribble the ball, Avery Bradley initiate an offense, Javale McGee post ups, Kyle Kuzma, and Andre Drummond play 25 minutes a night. Russ’s turnovers are coming from him being too unselfish, so I’m not worried at all about the preseason."
"&gt;Avery Bradley   &gt;   &gt;Danny Green   &gt;   &gt;LeBron James   &gt;   &gt;Anthony Davis   &gt;   &gt;2011 Dwight  That defense is making me consider taking them, my god."
Avery Bradley  Danny Green  LeBron James  Anthony Davis  2011 Dwight  vs  Rajon Rondo  Ray Allen  Paul Pierce  Kevin Garnett  2001 Shaq
Jeff Green and Avery Bradley are still in the league
IT and Gelo &gt; Avery Bradley and the other guys
Avery Bradley hands down
He drafted horrible. Coaching he was ok but tried to make Drummond the focal point of the offense with dhos that usually lead to long 2 pointers from Avery Bradley.
I read the whole thing. Imagine your team winning the championship that year and you're thinking about Avery Bradley. You're still weird for being mad someone didn't leave his family during the height of a global pandemic.
Bellarmine Prep Legend Avery Bradley!
For real thought Avery Bradley had no offense
"Avery Bradley would’ve been unbeatable if he had Marcus Smart size. His awareness and on-ball defense were top tier, wasn’t a very good scorer but serviceable"
Except Avery Bradley got covid like 3-4 months later after he sat out
F Avery Bradley! Bum bailed on the Lakers in the bubble but still got a championship ring
"Yeah, that flair checks out lol  He honestly just looks like what Donovan was projected to actually be when he was drafted. Avery Bradley on steroids"
No offense to Avery Bradley but he was more of a hospital bed than an NBA player when he “played” here in Miami last year.
20 teams that passed Avery Bradley around like a bong said “no offense” but they don’t care
"Last year of his career Andre, Avery Bradley isn't the same player he used to be and hasn't been signed to a permanent deal, and Kuminga and Moody are rookies who likely won't play too much."
"He'd be perfect next to Draymond. I can't think of a better PF for him to pair with, especially on a team with the spacing we (will) have.   I would do this in a heartbeat to contend now:   Warriors get:   * Domantas Sabonis  Pacers get:   * James Wiseman  * Moses Moody  * Salary filler (Gary Payton II, Mychal Mulder)  * 2022 1st  A lineup of Steph/Klay/Wiggins/Dray/Sabonis with Poole/Otto/Iguodala/Juan Toscano-Anderson/Looney bench and depth of Avery Bradley/Lee/Kuminga/Bjelica makes me wet"
Booker only put up 70 because Avery Bradley sucks at guarding him smh
"I mean you used Avery Bradley as an example of a guy capable of hitting shots and playing defence when he opted not to even go to the bubble.   You’re also saying “shoot-outs” as if having a player like Monk will make the Lakers a bottom tiered defence. The fact is, Monk is a role player who has been on a shitty team. Most role players are able to excel when they get to play for teams that want them to focus on their strengths (like the Lakers will).   Realistically, they just need good enough spacing, and they have plenty of guys to plug and plop inbeside Lebron and AD to work out a lineup with good spacing and good defence. Saying that they will be in shoot outs ignores that the Lakers were playing multiple guys that were bad at individual defence (or known as poor defenders) and still had an elite D.  This team will also have a notably better offence than previous years teams"
"It's a rather poor return that they got for Harden, to be honest.  Rockets got Oladipo, Exum, Brooklyn's 2022, 2024, and 2026 1sts, and Milwaukee's 2022 1st (from Cleveland).  There's pick swaps in there (2021, 2023, 2025, 2027) but those are unlikely to convey any time soon (the 2021 did not).  They traded Oladipo on to Miami for Avery Bradley (left in free agency), Kelly Olynyk (left in free agency) and a 2022 pick swap.  Here's what Houston still has from the Harden trade:  * Brooklyn 2022, 2024, &amp; 2026 1sts (2022 and 2024 are likely to be late round picks.  2026 is too far out to say)    * Milwaukee's 2022 1st (likely to be a late round pick)    * Pick swap with Miami in 2022- unlikely to convey    * Pick swaps with Brooklyn in 2023 (unlikely to convey), 2025 (possibly conveys), and 2027 (possibly conveys)    * Dante Exum  That's a lot of nothing for Harden  Vs the rumored package of Simmons, Thybulle, picks and potentially Maxey.  Even if you think that Simmons isn't worth building around, you turn and flip him like they tried to with Dipo."
"Avery Bradley didn’t show up to the bubble and opted out. Green couldn’t space the floor either for most of the playoffs. He shot 33.9% in the playoffs from 3, shooting 29% in the finals. Hell even KCP shot 30% in the finals.   Sure their defence might take a slight hit, but their spacing will be better for sure. Good chance Monk is a better defender with AD as his anchor than he was with Zeller.    So it’s weird that you say they have the worst spacing in the league, and when I pointed out that they have better spacing than their championship teams roster (who weren’t the worst spacing in the league) you then flip it to they won’t be good defensively.  The 5 most played players in the finals in 2020 for the Lakers were;  Rondo, Caruso, KCP, Lebron, AD.   So the Lakers top 5 is definitely improved this season, I just think the competition is also better"
"Avery Bradley was not great, but that should get better with time. Chiozza was terrible."
Good point. I actually didn’t see the play before hand. If Avery Bradley is rushing to contest a 3 because someone else missed an assignment… well that’s different
Actually yeah on a closer look it seems like he didn’t plant the left leg and stepped on the lower wall of the left shoe.    My question is that putting someone in skates? On a close out?  Either you do commit or you give up an open shot to a streaky scorer   And I wouldn’t consider Avery Bradley elite defender anymore. Maybe advanced stats say different
Avery Bradley making an All Defensive 1st Team is one of the funniest results in NBA History. It just cracks me up whenever I see it.   Almost up there with Isaiah Thomas coming top 5 in MVP voting -- ahead of Steph Curry.   Mid 2010s Celtics propaganda was so fucking lit.
I recall seeing a yt video a few years ago about the most averahe nba player (including size and all) and the answer was: Avery Bradley.
Literally what I’m thinking right now. Even the Avery Bradley signing was new to me. All of a sudden on media day I see AB in a dubs uni.
"Nah, my money is on Avery Bradley. Gotta make sure he makes that 15th roster spot."
Are you talking about Avery Bradley or GPII?
Payton II is more similar to Avery Bradley than Smart. Bradley was also an insane athlete and had a solid all around game on offense while improving as a spot up shooter over his time in Boston.
Avery Bradley imo
Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley is the best on ball defender in the league during the 20 games a season he plays.
Who's avery Bradley?
Avery Bradley would like a word.
"""The young soliciate said at media day that he's still waiting for an apology from Avery Bradley for his brutal slur earlier."""
Honestly I’m really gonna miss Avery Bradley.
took me forever to figure out NB and AB are Nemanja Bjelica and Avery Bradley wtf
the disrespect to Lakers legend Avery Bradley
"Such a low-key ""demand"" from your star player to want Avery Bradley over fucking Russ LOL."
"So Westbrook becomes worse, Melo becomes more of a ball hog, AD is back to his most inefficient season, DeAndre is Deandre, Dwight and Rondo on the verge of being passed around the league like instagram thots, etc. The only thing you're getting out of that is LeBron (more athleticism, worse shooting and passing) and better Avery Bradley."
"Just about everyone in the oration was a great defender. Kuzma was solid, Danny green was good, Avery Bradley is above average, Wes Mathews was okay, plus all the people you mentioned. The only truly bad defender was Ben McLemore who barely played for that reason."
"He's a really streaky volume scorer that doesn't get to the line or the rim and plays selfishly. So he's prone to weeks where he pops off like this, but also weeks where he's just terrible and has bottom tier efficiency.   He's also an Avery Bradley type defender who can't switch onto larger players and primarily provides value from on ball guard defense, which is the least valuable type of defense. Aka, he passes the eye test, but doesn't actually provide the value you'd think on that.   He's a prime candidate to get overpaid."
I think part of the secret of the Warriors doing well is that the front office loves our stars but does not let them make personnel decisions.  e.g. no we are not keeping Avery Bradley.
"Stagger Lebron and Westbrook minutes so that all 48 minutes at least one is on the court. Don't ever give nongarbage time minutes DJ and Bazemore. Only play Avery Bradley if the opposing teams best player is a small guard. Don't give Melo minutes if he doesn't box out(opposing team) for rebounds. Make everyone on the team put effort to go for defensive rebounds. Russ don't shoot 3s unless no time on shotclock. AD never shoot 3s. Lebron chuck up more 3s in the minutes he's playing with Westbrook of his drive&amp;kicks. Never play Rondo in Westbrook minutes. Even with all this the team has terrible perimeter defense,  but with these adjustments I think they can do much better than now."
"Apparently Steph, Draymond and some of the other vets wanted Avery Bradley and the FO was like, “Lol, nah.”   This is why you leave the roster moves to your GM."
The warriors players fought for Avery Bradley but management went with GP2.  Funny how that works out
Unless you play us and Monk/Avery Bradley just shoot the lights out...
did we just quadruple team avery bradley in the paint to leave Anthony fucking Davis open!?
Forgot to mention the acquisition of Avery Bradley (though he was a Laker before the Warriors).
Avery Bradley didn't play that night
"Ahh I see. That’s fair I should have read your comment closer. Almost sounded like you think players are coming to Golden State so they can intern at Google in the off-season lol. Maybe it’s true that a guy like Bjelica, OPJ or even Avery Bradley who didn’t make the team were more interested in the warriors than other organizations because of the opportunity to play with Steph. I wouldn’t know but I guess I agree more with the commenter on the attractiveness to other NBA players point than the rise in value point. We’ll never know what the organization would be valued at right now without the 3 rings in 5 straight championship runs but it doesn’t sound insane to me to suggest that played a role too."
"Don't forget him flubbing the inbounds pass, then shaking his head at Avery Bradley like it wasn't his fault in the first place."
Paul George? Marcus Smart? Eric Gordon? Avery Bradley?
"I’d say that’s part of his game, but they clearly adjusted that in their title season. In the playoffs last year the Bucks used Jrue and Middleton as their primary initiators running iso/PnR. They got Giannis the ball in similar ways as AD gets it, post ups, lobs, pick and roll. Their go to actions were either Middleton PnR or dribble handoffs revolving around all three of their best players directly involved but the two perimeter players getting the ball to make a pass. Especially as these games went to the final shots, it was Middleton self created midrange jumpers, not Giannis up top.   The Bucks shifted to playing Giannis less like he did against the Raptors and more like a big man who has scoring skills of his own.   I disagree on our general idea of who is creating the advantage in certain pick and roll combinations. When you see Rondo having a great passing game hitting AD on lobs and rolls, it’s not exactly because Rondo is breaking down the defense, but because AD is creating opportunities that wouldn’t necessarily be there if it was another big.   The amount of true 1 vs 1 opportunities Davis gets isn’t that high. When you’re playing a fair amount of your minutes with Westbrook or another center, because the Lakers wings are injured, those chances aren’t going to be too frequent. What looks like 1 man coverage isn’t because you have guys helping off the Lakers lack of shooting. There was a play today which resulted in a Avery Bradley three which Carter mentioned was 1 on 1 and he wanted to see AD take Middleton. Well, it wasn’t single coverage and that’s why Bradley was open to begin with."
I see why GSW let Avery Bradley go.
A single play of him getting back cut from a screen that I'm not even sure Avery Bradley called out is worth more to you than anchoring a dominant defensive championship team?
"Avery Bradley has been washed for like 5 years. He had his best stretch in boston, maybe 1-2 more years after he left but all the years after he's been bad"
"Oh my god, THE Avery Bradley?"
&gt;of course ad is better at d  i thiiiink they meant to write ab for avery bradley.  but who knows.
Bob Myers helped create this too. Like waiving Avery Bradley even though Steph and Dray liked him to keep GPII. He made great moves.
"&gt; In impact entries that take on and off court splits in addition to box scores stats into account he was top 5 in the the postseason from 2015-19.  Can you share any non-cumulative ones of these so we can look over them to see if that's measuring how valuable Draymond is as a singular player, compared to his value compared to the player replacing him in the Warriors scheme?   &gt; ""aNd NevEr HaS bEeN"" it was literally the most valuable skill in the league for 30 years. You know one player won 11 rings off the back off of his defence.  Which 30 years were those? Because defense was, uh, not particularly existent in the 50s and 60s. Even when you're speaking of Bill Russell and those Celtics teams, they were constantly at the top of the league in PPG and played at the highest pace in the 60s. The only reason why they didn't have the #1 ORTG every season was because of that insane pace leading to, well, more questionable shots than usual. Even by those standards.  You could make the argument that it was their defense that allowed them to have such a high scoring offense I suppose but that's pretty cyclical. I mean look at the 63 East Finals against a lousy defensive team in the Royals.   Game 1: **Royals 135** Celtics 132  Game 2: **Celtics 125** Royals 102  Game 3:** Royals 121** Celtics 116 Game 4:** Celtics 128** Royals 110  Game 5: **Celtics 125** Royals 120  Game 6: **Royals 109** Celtics 99  Game 7: **Celtics 142** Royals: 131   Or what about the 66 Finals vs. the Lakers?   Game 1:** Lakers 133** Celtics 129  Game 2: **Celtics 129** Lakers 109  Game 3: **Celtics 120** Lakers 106  Game 4: **Celtics 122** Lakers 117  Game 5: **Lakers 121** Celtics 117  Game 6: **Lakers 123** Celtics 115  Game 7: **Celtics 95** Lakers 93  Russell, Havlicek, and Sam averaged 23 a piece, West and Baylor averaged 34 and 25 respectively. I implore you to go watch some tape from the 50s and 60s and try to come away with the opinion that defense was the premier skill and reason for winning back then. Hell I'd say stamina was more of a factor for winning then than defense, considering it was just a track meet up and down the court every game.  &gt; Draymond performed like a low level MVP candidate in his prime  He has only had votes casted for him one time in his entire career. That was the 15-16 record season setting where he came in 7th and his teammate, Steph Curry, was the unanimous MVP. Because Mike Fratello and John Denton had him aas their #2 MVP. Denton who had Avery Bradley as his #2 in DPOY voting, case the sole 6th man vote for...Allen Crabbe... Fratello who had LMA and Pau Gasol on his All-NBA 1st team. Cmon now. Even Draymond said in an interview he couldn't believe he got those two votes.  You are conflating the value that Draymond receives from being on some of the greatest teams of all time compared to his actual standalone value. No doubt he is a big part of those teams, but to suggest his standalone value as a player is anywhere near the quality of an MVP is past even the most fervent of fandom takes. I like Draymond as a player, a lot. He does truly unique things. If you put him on any other team besides the Warriors his value drops off a cliff. If you put any other ""MVP"" players on a different team, ever, their value does not change much.   You would have to suggest that Draymond is account for 20+ points negated on defense alone to have the same standalone impact as an MVP caliber player, which would be by far the most of all time by lightyears.  By every single defensive metric you're going to find, Rudy Gobert is a more impactful defender than Draymond Green. In fact Gobert has a number of the best defensive seasons of all time. Rudy had the highest DRAPTOR rating of all time last year at +8 going back to 77. The highest DRPM since 1996. #1 and #3 DEPM seasons since 04. DLEBRON says he has the #1 and #4 best defensive seasons of all time. He has the single season record for most team points allowed since 06-07.   This was all last season.  So by every ""impact"" and ""performance"" metric there is, the solid ones or as solid as you can be since defensive metrics are kinda meh, Gobert is a vastly superior defender than Draymond, and last season might have been the best defensive season of all time. Did you feel like he was an MVP candidate? Was he even a low-level candidate? Probably not something you had ever considered and you might not consider it right now either.   &gt; AD is no doubt a better scorer but most most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let's not undersell that first point.   Draymond's best scoring season was on the 73 win warriors where he scored 14 points a game on 49/39/68. Excluding this season he would never average over 45% from the floor again or over 30% from 3 again. Nor did he before that. No doubt Draymond is a better passer, that's part of his role in that offense because he cannot score at an NBA level. He averages 5 more assists a game than AD for his career.  AD is not used as a passer even if he is better than we think because he is an elite scorer. He is the guy people like Draymond pass the ball to. He is on a streak of 9 straight 20+ ppg seasons. 7 of which are over 24 points. 4 of which are over 26. 2 of which are over 28. Obviously on much better efficiency than Draymond from every shooting location that is tracked. He's not just a better scorer. Most years he double or triples Draymond's scoring.   Even considering Draymond's elite positional passing and being on historic offenses he only cracks the top 20 of OWS once. That 15-16 outlier season for him where he was 10th. AD is top 20 6 times, and top 5 4 times.   Draymond has never been top 20 in OBPM. Anthony Davis has not only been top 20 6 times but he is 14th overall in NBA history by that measure.  The levels of value on offense that AD is greater than Draymond, even when Draymond sits on these historic offensive teams that are the absolute perfect positions for him imaginable in all of NBA history, are staggering. They cannot even be mentioned in the same breath. Draymond is like if you fused a non-rebounding Dennis Rodman with a non-scoring Andre Miller. AD is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.   &gt; most of his championship equity outside of that single bubble run (because he was shooting like 40% on 3s and 60% on midrange Js) comes as a defender as he isn't effective as a scorer in isolation or a playmaker, (which isn't the case with Draymond as he is an excellent passer).  First of all let me make it clear. I don't care about championships in this discussion, nor do I think it's particularly relevant when assessing the individual talent of players. Especially in this case however, because there is no case that Draymond is a #1, 2, or 3 offensive option on his team--so there isn't a discussion to be had like Jokic vs. AD wherein you can suggest Jokic is that extra level better because he's a true all game #1 option that leads to winning.   As Gilbert Arenas said in regards to the 75th Anni List redo he did, ""Championships are the cherry on top of the sundae, stats, all-nbas, all-stars, individual achievements are the sundae. Championships are just this extra thing on top of that to be a tie breaker or a nudge over the edge.""   So while AD did go crazy in the bubble, and conspiratorial as it may be I think that he and the Lakers got some serious help from the refs, it's not like it was some outlier among outliers like Draymond 15-16 season. Certainly his bubble run (28/10/3.5/1/1.5 on 57/38[3 attempts]/73) was better than his other playoff seasons (31/11/2/1/3 on 54/00/89 and 31/13/2/2/2 on 52/27[2 attempts]/83) shows he is still an elite playoff performer. In fact when you account for the fact he was on wildly worse teams than that LA team in 15 and 18 where teams could double and swarm him all game, compared to a Lakers team with LeBron and shooters, and the fact that most shooters got hot in that bubble, it's even less of a staggering outlier.  As far as being effective as a scorer in isolation in 19-20 AD was in the 71st percentile for isolation scorers. Not elite but certainly not ineffective. That was better than players like Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, and around the same as Jason Tatum and CP3.   As you can imagine Draymond is in the no-percentile on that because they would never isolate Draymond. Additionally playmaking is more than assists, which Draymond is an elite passer especially for his position but he is not a good playmaker.   Playmaking is not passing, that's just one component of it. Playmaking comes from being a threat to get places on the court to score or pass.  The more of those places and the more ways you can do that, the better a playmaker you are. The play part of playmaking is there for a reason, and there are many more plays than a pass. Otherwise we'd call it a passmaker. Draymond isn't a threat to score, he isn't a threat for the defense to collapse in on, his passing comes from passing to people off screens or when the defense makes a mistake because his IQ is great. It also comes from his elite 2 man game with Curry, the best shooter of all time who is going to convert a lot of those assists. But a playmaker he is not.   &gt; Its the same with Giannis and Embiid as well. Their scoring is brilliant but their value in the postseason comes from their standout defence.  No. It comes from both. I don't even really understand how you can come to the conclusion that their value in the postseason comes from their standout defense more than their scoring, let alone the sole value.   Continued:"
"Nah man for Duncan's first ring with Robinson they had Sean Eliot, Avery Bradley, Vinny Del Negro, lots of solid perimeter players  It was his second ring in 03 that was the true carry job, as most of his old team was gone but Manu/TP hadn't ascended yet   Then in 05 and on through the end of his career he had good perimeter players again"
"In this scenario, couldn't you trade away KCP and sign Caruso in his place?   Then it would be $18M for 9 spots and leave the last spot open since you wouldn't need Avery Bradley with Caruso there. Most of your other spots have been spent on vet mins anyways and you have Austin Reaves who's cheaper than the vet min."
"Yeah the roster just isn't working with the current rotations. Avery Bradley and Kent bazemore just don't fit into any line-up well in my opinion. Deandre is lacklustre and we don't know if Dwight can do anything meaningful yet.  They would benefit greatly from a proper 6man and staggered rosters, I could easily see Westbrook come off the bench and take that role."
Well if situations were reversed Lakers would be running Demar at the point.  Since they would have been hard capped by time Rondo and Avery Bradley came available.  Reaves also wouldn’t be on the roster most likely.    Hard cap is $143 million.  Lakers at $156 without Westbrook they would be at $111 but they wouldn’t even be there because they would still be carrying the salary from whomever wasn’t included in the Demar deal and in the Westbrook deal.  Not even sure they could have resigned Schroeder and kept it under the hard cap even at the Boston number he took.
"What does this have to do with being a homer? I'm just saying that he deserves to be in the league and shouldn't be benched for worse players like Avery Bradley. I agree that building a roster where the only perimeter defenders are Kent Bazemore and 36-year old Trevor Ariza coming off ankle surgery is asinine. Having to do that because you traded for 33-year old Russell Westbrook and cheaped out on luxury tax as the Lakers is even more asinine.  I'm always ready to shit on Rob Pelinka who I've considered a bottom 5 GM basically since he was hired or the Lakers ownership who tried to make Caruso feel bad for wanting what he's worth.   What I have an issue with is people underrating players who have memeable lowlights. Baze is a solid rotation player and a good defender despite a high foul rate for a perimeter player.   As far as Buddy is concerned, I don't really think that would've been a panacea. He's a high volume average efficiency scorer who is awful defensively. Not sure he'd be able to close games in the conference finals. Trading Kuzma+Harrell+pick for him would've been solid and kept KCP and Caruso but I would've liked to target someone with more two-way ability."
"I've watched around 8 games mainly for the comedic entertainment. ""By far the worst"" is a pretty strong statement when Avery Bradley leads negative in net rating by such ridiculous margins (-16.5) on similar minutes played.   RAPTOR again portrays Bazemore as a plus defender at +1.8, one of the best on the roster. This stat again portrays Bradley and Westbrook as the worst players on the roster. Bazemore's main problem is on the offensive end, he's not really knocking down shots and is many percentages below his career average from 2s and 3s. But yeah ""worst player"" for a guy being paid a vet min to me is a bit comical. I guess he's the new scapegoat?"
Just look at Avery Bradley lmao.
"Facts. Our stars wanted Avery Bradley, but the front office said no and went with GP2 instead. I think it's working out well for us so far."
avery bradley a -28 lmfao
"Heat - Lebron James, Andre Iguodala, Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, Avery Bradley  Rockets are OP but I wanted to make one for Miami"
I for one think Dj should be waived and Avery Bradley should be signed to a guarantee contract
"&gt;who cares, only the denver nuggets should give a shit about something like this. or whatever team he plays for.  Who cares about Nuggets or Jokic outside of Denver wah wah wah.  This is an NBA sub.  Lets talk about NBA stuff like THT or Avery Bradley or the Lakers record or Russell Westbrook ...  ... oh but, just in case the Lakers get Jokic someday, it will also be ok to care about Jokic too lol."
Avery Bradley and Rajon Rondo scored 0 pts in 42 minutes of combined played.
"I think it's just hard to evaluate a player's defense when you don't watch him that much.  Ironically it's what happened to me when Avery Bradley ended up on the Pistons for example.  And yeah Bazemore LOOKS like a good defender, he clearly tries hard, he's pretty athletic, but he's really mistake prone"
"Steph wants the Warriors to give a guy a shot, that guy gets a shot. We tried out Avery Bradley, we picked up Damion Lee, I think a connection to Steph is how we came to try out Alfonso McKinnie.  Steph doesn't decide whether that guy gets *kept*. D.Lee stayed on because the FO saw some potential in him that he's now living up to. McKinnie played pretty well for most of that year.  I think that's the best way to approach it. Your star gets *input*."
Steph wanted to keep Avery Bradley instead of Gary Payton II and Bob Myers said no. There’s your answer to proper autonomy for a franchise player.
"Curry and Kerr wanted Avery Bradley and Myers said no and signed GP2. The GM decides everything and can ignore everyone, if he doesnt he's a bad GM."
"We took a title team with the shortest off season in post season history where continuity was going to matter more than any season prior and we dumped/didn't bring back:   Danny Green, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, Avery Bradley, Rondo   and instead of get what we needed - shooters - we brought in:  Harrell, Schroder, and Gasol cause it looked good on paper. Then we spent an entire season with no shooters and playing small cause of Harrell.   And now there's this last off season ... where we mortgaged every last asset we had for Russell Westbrook. FFS."
"Shoutout to Bob Myers and the rest of the Warriors FO  Didn't they waive Avery Bradley (one team's trash is now another team's trash), to sign Payton as their 15th man?  Yes, the LeBron's, Durant's, Steph's and Giannis's of the world don't grow in trees, but you don't win championships by merely lucking out in the draft with these generational players. You build 1 through 15.  This is why some teams can tank as hard as they want but still can't win, let alone get out of the second round."
Russ wasn't guarding D'Lo this game. It was Avery Bradley and Bazemore.
"*GPII is such a difference maker for the Warriors, insane he almost didnt make the roster for the corpse of Avery fucking Bradley*  IIRC GP2 was coming off an injury towards the beginning of preseason that's why they were trying to find another lockdown guard. But he probably got cleared and showed he can play in time."
"Curry came in to this game on a mission, phenomenal all around game from the Chef, (his defense in particular stood out today imo)  Kuminga's one on one D is impressive for a rookie, multiple Bulls players tried to take him off the dribble only to call for a screen to force a switch, showed off some nice handles and finishing ability too  Warriors started heavy trapping/Box and oneing Lavine in the 3rd quarter and the Bulls had no answer for it, led to the warriors clamping the Bulls in the 3rd and going on that massive run  GPII is such a difference maker for the Warriors, insane he almost didnt make the roster for the corpse of Avery fucking Bradley  Bulls need to do a better job getting good looks for Lavine, he's their best player he shouldnt have to work so hard for looks all the time, Warriors run specific sets and plays to get Curry open looks too get in rhythm, Bulls should look to do the same for Lavine.    Lavine also needs to work on his body language when shits not going right, if the best player on the team starts hanging his head and giving off negative body language it hurts the rest of the teams morals, which in turn hurts the teams ability to stabilize or come back  Lonzo might be the most hot and cold shooter ive ever seen, dudes either 6-9 or 1-9 from three, very little in between, he also lack other scoring options, so if he aint hitting hes pretty bad on offense  Bulls fought hard but were undermanned  Oh and for all those people talking about how the warriors havent played anyone/they just got lucky, good teams take care of business, Lakers dropped 2 too OKC, Utah dropped one to the Jazz, etc"
I keep hearing this. He has a good frame defensively. Taller than most pgs with a long wingspan. Guys like pat bev and avery Bradley are shorter and play solid D. If anything he is not as quick laterally.
Latest example would be cutting Avery Bradley.
"Your eyeballs have an anti-Westbrook filter on, #20 (Avery Bradley) is CLEARLY matched up on Herro to start and dies on the screen set by Dedmon.   Westbrook did nothing wrong except get outrebounded by a 7 footer with a running start"
That Avery Bradley defense was on point.
Avery Bradley is a good defender but this dude stays holding onto guys like crazy
warriors let us have avery bradley for free
And to think we almost cut him to keep a spot open for buyout season or almost chose Avery Bradley over him.
Avery Bradley 🔒
"Mark jackson needs to stop calling avery bradley an elite defender, he is still good defender but he aint no elite defender"
Yeah……I don’t think Avery Bradley is getting that
Avery Bradley gtfo 😒
Add Avery Bradley to the list of “people having A better season than Russ”
Heat Legend Avery Bradley having his revenge game
It's gonna be an Avery Bradley revenge game isn't it. Smh
Avery Bradley begging to get T’d up lol
"&gt;This one was literally an offensive foul by Avery Bradley lmfao.  Not literally.  &gt;Tech but the ref/Russ were jawing all night. The audio also says it was on Frank Vogel. Also it was a bullshit foul but obviously, you cut that out.  The bench (delay of game), Melo, and Westbrook all got technical fouls. Whether or not the initial foul was BS is pretty irrelevant when the opposing team is shooting free throws for the two techs your team has already picked up for arguing the call.  Yet Westbrook still insisted on picking up the third tech.  &gt;AD getting bullied by Rozier in the paint  Westbrook wasted the shot clock and then couldn't get a pass off."
"1) Bad decision to pass by Russ. Horrible cut by Bradley.  2) Great defense by Rozier.   3) Bad turnover, he loses it.  4) This one was literally an offensive foul by Avery Bradley lmfao.  5) Tech but the ref/Russ were jawing all night. The audio also says it was on Frank Vogel. Also it was a bullshit foul but obviously, you cut that out.  6) AD getting bullied by Rozier in the paint"
Avery Bradley has been on 7 teams in 3 years and is on a vet min. Lakers sold the farm to pay Westbrook 44 million a year.
"Avery Bradley was worse, -20. Just a lot of running around doing nothing for AB"
Also imagine if the corner guy was Wayne Ellingon or Monk instead of Avery Bradley.  Why was Avery in for an offensive  possession
I’m watching Lakers game rn and the commentators are like “lamelo ball is blowing past elite defender Avery bradley” I’m like he’s not elite anymore 😂
I miss the days of arguing Tony Allen vs Avery Bradley as best perimeter defender on operation sports
"Insane how close GP3 was to not even cracking the roster. Even I was surprised they kept him over Avery Bradley, but boy was I wrong."
"They actually should have kept Markief Morris also (who wanted to return on a min deal) and signed another wing for defense like James Ennis or Wes Matthews.  They had Austin Reaves on a 2 way contract so there was no actual need to use a roster spot to sign him to the team.   Front orifice messed up over the course of the year.   Imagine....  Lowry, Nunn, Caruso Hield, Bazemore, Monk Ariza, Ennis, Matthews (or Avery Bradley) LeBron, Morris, Anthony AD, Howard, DJ"
He wasn't that efficient from 2 and definitely couldn't shoot 3s. He also doesn't have the best vision and has issues making accurate passes. If he didn't have such problems on offense he definitely could have gotten minutes like a Avery Bradley or Patrick Beverley
prime avery bradley
"I would say the bubble every team didn't go through the same thing. Some players/teams didn't even want to be there. Lakers even lost Avery Bradley. Paul George correct me if I'm wrong mother is sick? And he in the bubble and can't see her. Some players literally could not deal with the bubble. Being stuck in one place for weeks. Guys sneaking women in, sneaking out to Magic City and so forth. Also the 4 months off helped teams like the Lakers given Lebron age and AD injuries.  Hell AD was hurt by the time the finals came around. He probably wouldn't of lasted if it wasn't for the 4 month break."
Remember when Chris Broussard didn't vote for Avery Bradley for his all defense team because he apparently allowed Booker to drop 70 on them in a game he didn't even play? How do the media members even get to vote? Most of them don't even watch the games.
"To be fair to the Lakers, Avery Bradley and DeAndre Jordan might very well be out of the rotation entirely when the Lakers get all their injured players back. Bradley was grabbed as a stop gap to tide the Lakers over until Talen Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn are healthy (Bradley's contract isn't guaranteed, so he can just be released if needed). And the Lakers have said they want to play AD more at center, but currently the only forward they had available tonight was Melo, so they kinda have to play Jordan and Dwight.   If you look at the guys the Lakers have who can play forward it's LeBron, AD, Melo, Ariza and THT, and tonight only Melo was available. If you look at who the Lakers have who can handle the ball it's LeBron, Westbrook, Nunn, THT and Rondo, and only Russ and Rondo were available. But they're pretty well set with  bench level shooting guards and centers, so there's that. The Lakers are absolutely decimated in really specific ways and are just scrambling to field even remotely workable lineups. They're gonna be bad until they get some of these players back healthy, there's really no way around that."
"If someone in the off-season had said ""let me put together a lineup made up exclusively of players on vet minimum contracts and Russell Westbrook"" how good would anyone have expected that team to be? Because other than the 7 minutes AD played tonight, that's exactly what the lineup was.   The Lakers have five players who are making more than the minimum this year, and four of them combined to play 7 minutes tonight. The other one was Russell Westbrook. Everyone else is hurt or had a stomach flu. The Lakers are absolutely decimated by injuries right now, but for whatever reason nobody seems to be aware of it or willing to acknowledge it.   Tonight both of the Lakers two-way players played. They also played their undrafted rookie, Austin Reaves (who only has $100k of his salary guaranteed) 25 minutes tonight. They started a guy on a non-guaranteed minimum contract (Avery Bradley), a guy they claimed off waivers the day before the season started, and he played 23 minutes. Their starting center was salary dumped and bought out this summer, as was their backup point guard (Jordan and Rondo).  They combined to play 33 minutes tonight. Everyone else who played was signed for the vet minimum this summer.   This is not even close to what the Lakers rotation will look like when they are fully healthy, but right now they are missing LeBron, AD, Talen Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn and Trevor Ariza. Ariza will probably only play about 15-20 mpg, but the other guys will probably play 25-40 mpg, and they were all out tonight. If people want to know what is going on with the Lakers, it's quite simple: it's injuries and illness."
"Honestly their depth is pretty garbage. Avery Bradley and bazemore got the boot from the dubs and now they play significant minutes. Melo can get hot but doesn’t play D, same with monk. Dwight is okay"
"Kuminga is under team control for so much longer than anyone else involved. He will be an RFA after this season plus 3 more. RoCo is an unrestricted free agent after this season.  It is lazy to just ignore future years when running a team. Bob Myers doesn't say to himself, ""I don't give a crap if we are the worst team in basketball once Curry stops dominating."" As for wasting primes, their team is looking pretty good right now...  Not every player is LeBron, putting pressure on the front office to sell the kitchen sink. Curry signed long term because he believes they are smart decision makers. And it often actually helps the team to not listen to player demands. The Warriors vets wanted Avery Bradley. The front office went with GPII instead, and the team is +32.4 per 100 in the 73 minutes he's played."
Levert was like the only actual player they got back and they turned him into Olynk and Avery Bradley lol.
"He just moped a lot and I’ve never seen a player not get back on defense so much before. He was a horrible team player too, shooting threes and over-committing to try and get steals. You play like that for years in the D and you’re getting booed when you come back, shit we booed Rick Mahorn when he came back and he won a championship with us. It’s Detroit vs Everybody out here.   It’s not all Drummond’s fault though. SVG is one of the worst coaches in the NBA from a locker room perspective and an X’s and O’s perspective.  I tried telling Pelicans fans this when they signed him but some were still optimistic. Look how it worked out. No accountability in the locker room at al and his game plan is straight out of 2005. How many plays did we run where the shot was literally an Avery Bradley long two at the top of the key? Fucking mind-boggling, having that as your coach no doubt hurt Drummond’s career. To what extent we can only speculate."
Avery bradley 👀
"Yep, compared him to Avery Bradley myself earlier today  You guys aren't getting the best version of himself on offense though. He was much more effective playing off ball more like he was for us. He can't create well for himself and loves bad mids"
Maybe steph and dray said they wanted a Avery Bradley more to gas up gp2 this year
"GTJ has been okay. People love the flashy defense but it's more Avery Bradley level. Good at point of attack D but not good for the overall team concept. On offense, you take Norm 10 out of 10 times."
Someone photoshop Avery Bradley on there
Someone photoshop Avery Bradley on there
"The fact that Avery Bradley is playing big minutes who just got cut from the warriors roster tells you all you need to know about the lakers defense. There’s nothing good about their defense. They can’t defend point of attack, can’t rotate to close out or help, confusion on switches, and horrid rebounding. They had the formula to win 2 seasons ago and abandoned it in favor of having big names on the roster."
"I just watched the replay, and I honestly can’t fault Westbrook. He was trying to make the best of a truly broken play.  It looks like they were trying to get Melo open at the top of the arc, and have Avery Bradley leak to the space Melo emptied on the wing so Melo has the option to shoot or make the extra pass to Bradley.  But Anthony Davis set a weak screen that didn’t free Melo up, and Austin Reaves did a terrible job clearing space for Melo. Reaves is barely over half court when Melo gets to his spot, basically taking himself out of the play entirely. His man doesn’t have to worry about guarding him, so basically camps out in the spot where they’re trying to get Melo. Consequently Melo is double covered at the top of the arc.  Bradley’s guy is playing off, but spying Russ, so a pass isn’t advisable. Same with Davis. Russ can either shoot (and hope for a rebound play if he misses), or drive. Being down 3 I think he made the right decision.  It didn’t work out, but he’s trying to make the best of a bad situation.  How could they have made this play better? If Reaves cuts towards the right baseline corner he’s either going to clear space out for Melo, or potentially be open himself.  And if Davis sets a better screen for Melo, and then sets a screen for Bradley going in the opposite direction then he’s hopefully springing either Melo at the top of the arc, or Bradley cutting to the left baseline corner. Then Russ has options (or if he gets it to Melo, then Melo has the option to shoot, or make the extra pass to Bradley or Reaves). But hindsight is always 20/20."

"&gt; Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard  Lmfao"
"My best guess is that he was trying to go over the top of the defender and then fling it to Avery Bradley in the corner, but he just lost it on the way up.  He was too far out and too well covered to think a floater/layup was even a realistic possibility. Don't think he was trying to draw a foul with that. Think he was just trying to bring it up high and fling it across his body to Bradley, but just didn't get his fingers around the ball and it just flew out."
"Short term issue is their lack of health. LeBron just got hurt and they’re still missing THT, Ariza and Nunn. Their rotation still isn’t solidified.   A bigger issue is their roster construction is kinda wonky. Avery Bradley is the only guard that can offer defense, and the rest of their lineup is either 3 or D. Not very versatile players"
I can’t believe he did that foolishness. Are they really going to have to play Avery Bradley or Rondo at point in closing minutes. Like just take Russ off ball he out here just giving the damn ball away.
"Avery Bradley was the only guy who was relatively open on the play. Reeves was at half court, his man was guarding the passing lane to Melo, Melo had a man on his already, and AD was in the opposite corner, but inside for 2 and guarded. You could argue what could've been done to develop a better shot at 3.9 seconds left though."
Avery Bradley never saw it coming
"We ran a lineup with Rajon Rondo, Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, Kent Bazemore, and Dwight Howard with like 6 minutes left in the 4th quarter."
"They do a great job using and converting bad contracts. Turning CJ Miles into Dwight Howard, saved them money, then buying D12 out saved them even more. Waiving Avery Bradley before his contract was guaranteed saved them 11 mill. Picking at number 30 vs 31 gives them essentially the same guy for an extra 2 years on a rookie deal.  Trading Grayson when he was up for a bag illustrates this shrewdness.  Im not that concerned with their money management and decisions. They would have to whiff on several to undo the goodwill so far."
"He beat out Avery Bradley, who is starting for the Lakers and has looked good this year."
"You should check other social media platforms. chock full of ""we should have kept avery bradley for the vet experience"" even though he wasn't good during training camp."
"Warriors had their last roster spot unfilled right up till the start of the season. Steph, Dray and other veterans on the team were pushing hard to get the front office to keep Avery Bradley, but they cut him and later signed GP2."
He’s 28 played 10 games and averaged 2 points bruh not saying you should have avery bradley but let’s not act like he’s a good man plauer
Avery Bradley who??  GPII coming in clutch
"GP2 is a 2x pac-12 dpoy, g league champ and g league dpoy. And some of ya’ll wanted Avery Bradley 😂"
"I legit just shuddered at the thought of us having Avery Bradley instead, clanking wide open 3s and getting blown by after full court pressing"
Where are the warriors fans that were crying when they let Avery Bradley go?
gp2&gt;&gt;avery bradley glad the fo made that decision
"welp, GP2 over avery bradley was certainly the right choice"
Avery Bradley catching strays from Mark Jackson lol
gary “i’m better than avery bradley” payton ii
Avery Bradley caught a stray from Mark Jackson lol
The Avery Bradley who game?
GP2 is hella better than Avery Bradley.  Fite me.
"First of all that Finals wasn’t close at all. 6 games doesn’t mean it’s close.  Secondly the Lakers weren’t fully healthy. AD had a foot injury that bothered him all Finals and they were missing Avery Bradley for the entire playoffs.  Finally, we saw Miami with Bam and Dragic against the Lakers, it still wasn’t close.  Also yes, it was a toenail. If KD is a tiny bit further back the Bucks are out in round 2."
To be fair Avery Bradley put the clamps on Jalen. Man was running around screens like they weren't even there.
Literally the only player playing defense is Avery Bradley lol
Sengun got a handful of Avery Bradley glute.
"I was thinking about this recently when watching Avery Bradley defend. I swear he handchecks like a mother, and I’m like, i thought we couldn’t do that anymore?"
"Homie… I don’t know if you’re trolling or just a little out of the loop but Ariza was signed to start at PF with AD at the 5.  Even with THT I suspect we’d be able to start him at the 3, Bron the 4 and AD at the 5. (We have no wing depth, so we were forced to play the bigs more minutes)   And I was expecting Bron or Russ to run point all 48 minutes with Nunn chipping in. Rondo was signed to be a coach and playoff insurance policy, not a rotation player during the regular season.   If we were fully healthy DJ, Rondo, Reaves would not be playing and Avery Bradley would have never been signed."
"I don’t think Smart can be the leading voice in the locker room. Conspiracy theory time, but I think the second Smart got paid (summer of 2018) is when he started trying to jump the hierarchy as the longest tenured Celtic and it started this dysfunction we’ve been hearing about. It’s really hard to be a leader in a sport when you’re not the best player, or even the second best player on your team. I’m not a Smart hater but I think it’s ironic he called them out when he’s prone to taking dumb shots himself. Like I said, conspiracy theory.  However, I think there’s some truth to what he said here. Tatum/Brown not being able to play off of each other because they can’t run PnR action where they switch similar size defenders onto each other leaves them prone to standing around watching the other guy work. Their volume of shots combined just doesn’t leave enough for the rest of the team where if one of them has a bad game but takes 18-20 shots, the whole team suffers. The whole offense stutters and it throws off the whole rhythm and pace of the game, and with our team specifically, the effort.  Tatum and Brown are combining for nearly 45 shots a game (44.8) this season but combining for only 6.2 APG. In 2016-17 when they wildly overachieved, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley and Al Horford took a combined 45.3 shots per game and combined for 13.1 APG. It is undeniable they played more team basketball than they are now."
"Not really, spacing isn't the issue. Monk is a good shooter yet Avery Bradley plays over him. They are prioritizing defense. Melo is the exception."
Putting up a zero is more Avery Bradley-like
For all of the meme-ing around Avery Bradley I still loved his fit on the Lakers in the 2019-2020 season
I have two and they have a very similar theme  One is this Jeff Green buzzer beater over LeBron (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jCq6HjIJGw)  The second is the Avery Bradley buzzer beater in the ECF vs the CAVS
"Understandably.  Guy had to wait til the last minute for a training camp invite from the Warriors and then got cut.  Lakers picked him up 1 day before the first day of the season.  A Lakers blog had an article with the title  [Avery Bradley is not going to last on the Los Angeles Lakers for long](https://lakeshowlife.com/2021/10/19/avery-bradley-los-angeles-lakers-long/).  But if he's healthy, he's a proven productive player who is still only 30 years old."
I heard before the game AD was trying to convince Avery Bradley to play center.
Man Avery Bradley went from losing out on being the Warriors 15th man to Gary Payton II to starting on the Lakers real fast.
Avery Bradley is starting when he wasn’t even top 15 on the dubs
Avery Bradley playing center is a 2k cheat code. Let’s go
Avery Bradley starting while on a non-guaranteed contract and I love it. He just fits the team so well
Avery Bradley and Kent Bazemore as starters in 2021-22… oooffff
My thought all along is he's mainly been doing this because so much of the rotation is injured that he almost has to play DAJ and Dwight as much as he has just because he's short on players all over the roster. Maybe he's feeling more confidence in Avery Bradley now that he's had some time with the team so he feels comfortable doing this.
Avery Bradley gives them a much needed injection of youth into the starting lineup.
Avery Bradley at center? Interesting move Frank. Interesting move. /s
I am guessing this is why Avery Bradley was cut.
Avery Bradley
Avery Bradley with a +30 lmao
Avery Bradley with +30 somehow
Sexton the new Avery Bradley. LeBron got him last year too
Avery Bradley with +30 though. Sheesh.
*Avery Bradley helped
Avery Bradley showing some signs of 2020 Avery Bradley again. He fits Vogel's system and schemes. Vogel even took Monk out entirely today for Bradley.
"Also playing Avery Bradley a lot of minutes, who isn't a terrible defender, helped on the other side."
" After an ugly and shameful, turnover-filled first quarter, LAL completely turned this game around, and never looked back. LeBron and Carmelo were our two best players, solid contributions from Russell Westbrook, Avery Bradley, and Anthony Davis. Dwight Howard and DJ were so important in gaining those second chances buckets to help us keep the lead.  **Positives**: focus and effort for the last 3 quarters, very strong defensively in the fourth. Carmelo Anthony and LeBron. Dwight Howard hit a three.  **Negatives**: We still need to defend the pick and roll better. We need to start the game sharper, and relax on our turnovers."
Avery Bradley + Austin Reaves backcourt is the Lakers answer
Avery Bradley +30
Did Avery Bradley just amass a +30 in a 12-point win? Jesus
Avery Bradley and Reaves really did work defensively.
The Warriors really gave Avery Bradley to the Lakers for basically free.
Avery Bradley typical night: 2pts 1reb 1assist +37
Avery Bradley went from sneak dissing the Lakers 2 weeks ago to hitting clutch 3s now. What a development.
Avery Bradley picking off where he left off lol. Not washed on the Lakers apparently.
Avery Bradley and Dwight Howard are different when they wear Laker jerseys.
Man Warriors fucked up waiving Avery Bradley.
Avery Bradley?! Oh my goodness. I wasn't expecting the hanging body to be Bradley lol.
AVERY BRADLEY?!
"3 all stars... the veterans are way passed their prime and the 3 new players that were suppose to be in the rotation are injured. Also their youngest player is also injured. Only reason you seeing Austin Reaves, Avery Bradley, and Melo is because of injuries"
"Also, the main nuance people are missing in all this piling on with the Lakers is that a huge portion of their lineup is out injured, and has been all year. Maybe that's just people willingly ignoring that fact because it's fun to pile on the Lakers, or maybe they're not even aware of it, I don't know. But the last two games the Lakers have had half their rotation out injured, which obviously puts a huge burden on the guys who are still there, which isn't ideal in a back to back on the road following an overtime game for an older team.   Someone like Melo playing 31 minutes on the second night of a b2b on the road at 37 years of age is definitely not what the Lakers were envisioning this year, but they've been forced into stuff like that (and playing Westbrook and Rondo together, or big minutes for Avery Bradley or unsigned rookie Austin Reaves, etc) simply because they're so thin on bodies right now. Missing LeBron obviously has an impact, but so does missing Kendrick Nunn, Talen Horton-Tucker, Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington. With LeBron, Ariza and THT out, the Lakers only have one wing who's playing (Melo).   It's just a lot for a team that right now is exclusively minimum players outside of AD and Russ. And of course they're also trying to figure out playing together as they don't have any experience doing that. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Lakers are off to a rough start."
the alternative is avery bradley who has looked awful
"Financially, the FO had been pretty impressive. They take almost every opportunity to trim bucks where they can. Waived Avery Bradley before his contract became guaranteed, did a sign and trade of Delon Wright to get a million or so off the books, and signed Tyus Jones for less, and the CJ Miles deal especially was a masterpiece. Saved money trading for Dwight Howard, then saved money again with the buyout.  Knowing the financial advantage of a 30th pick vs the 31st is right in line with that savviness."
"i still can't believe a team that won a title by surrounding bron and AD with KCP, caruso, danny green, avery bradley, kuzma and rondo tuned into... whatever this is. feel bad for ya man"
Avery Bradley would’ve caught him smh
"Their 3- point shooting is completely unsustainable this season. Avery Bradley is not a career 56% 3-point shooter (he's at 36%), LeBron is not a career 48% 3-point shooter (he's at 34-35%) Rondo is not a career 44% 3-point shooter (32.3%) , Carmelo is not a career 43% 3-point shooter (35%) neither is Kent bazemore (35-36%), and Malik monk who's shooting 38% is still outperforming his career 34% significantly."
"If you look at exclusively Melo, Bazemore, Malik Monk, and Avery Bradley they’re shooting a higher percentage then any year the Lebron has been here. Even taking their shooting averages from last season, it’s still higher than the last two seasons."
"My point was the Laker fans aren’t just prisoners of the moment (like most fans of any team), but they’re also often dumb dicks about until they see the players play well elsewhere.  After 2020: Danny Green (death threats), Avery Bradley (mocked for skipping bubble over family health concerns), Javale (constantly called low IQ)  So far this season: Kuzma (called low IQ/empty stats/chucker his entire tenure), KCP (Binary Mamba, always either shot way too little or way too much), Trez (head case, no defense), Schroeder (been discussed ad nauseam)  Caruso and Dwight don’t count because the Laker fanbase actually wanted them back before they performed elsewhere. Everyone else caught mountains of shit until they played well for another team."
"AD is the only defender on the team that’s better than good. Avery Bradley is good. Bazemore is decent (what I’d consider average). Russ is just below average. His on ball is ok, until he has to fight around a screen. His rotations have been subpar, same for closeouts. He’s about average on this team, which is NOT a good thing"
"We also lost Avery Bradley, so in a way we got worse than we would’ve been had there not been a covid situation."
