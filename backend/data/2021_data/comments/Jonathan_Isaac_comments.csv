If Jonathan Isaac can get 20 mil then markannen certainly can.
"oooh yeah, rough stuff.  That trade was bad when it happened and only looks worse now.  He also gave Bismack Biyombo all that $$$ in free-agency, didn't he?  Looking at his draft record, he actually did okay all things considered.  I liked the Aaron Gordon pick at the time (and it's been written about that they really wanted Porzingis who went just before their pick), I was frustrated that he didn't make it to the Celtics that year.  Hezonja looks rough now but he was highly regarded coming into the draft.  Jonathan Isaac instead of Donovan Mitchell isn't looking great, but again at the time Isaac was a much more highly regarded prospect than Mitchell was.     Well whatever happens hopefully the Magic can turn it around.  Maybe this year they'll embrace a tank with a strong draft class and minimal revenue to be lost from attendance and they can build something new from the ground up."
2017 draft class extensions:  Jonathan Isaac: 20 mil (even after the major injury)  Fultz: 17 mil  Derrick White: 18 mil  OG Anunoby: 18 mil  Kennard: 16 mil  Kuzma: 13 mil  I'd say the market for Lauri is easily over 18 mil - offensively he's better than all these guys and still hasn't realized his potential yet. Bulls will likely just match any offer thrown at him.
"Fuck you to whoever posted this. Steve Clifford has led us to the playoffs two years in a row after missing it for like 7 years and you think we should fire him bc his team without Jonathan Isaac, markelle fultz, mcw, chuma, aminu, + Fournier being out for like 4 games, is losing games. Should the pacers jazz suns and nets also relocate as they’ve never won a championship and all of those teams have been in the league longer than us? What about the clippers nuggets timberwolves hornets grizzlies and pelicans? They’ve never even been to a finals. Come on bruh"
"For sure, there’s other guys that fit that kind of archetype, they’re just very high end players. Jonathan Isaac and Bam are in a somewhat similar mold as well."
"I'm starting to think that #1 jersey on the Orlando Magic is slightly cursed, Penny was struck down in his prime with serious injuries just as the team was about to become his following Shaq's departure to LA.  McGrady never got out of the 1st round in the playoffs (blew a 3-1 lead vs the Pistons in 2003, 1st year they changed from best-of-5 to 7) also had injuries issues though that was after he left the Magic, Arenas was the first player to be waived under the Amnesty clause.  And now Jonathan Isaac who has had rotten injury luck since he came in the league, played only 27 games his rookie year, and while largely healthy from then until January 2020 when he had a knee injury which he has so far not yet fully recovered from."
Jonathan Isaac
mcdaniels give me jonathan isaac vibes
Orlando and overrating Jonathan Isaac.  I love the guy but acting like he's anything more then a defensive specialist is being nice.
In Aaron Gordon's mini documentary about the dunk contest they had some locker room behind the scenes stuff and Dwight mentioned it but I thought he was talking crazy till I looked it up. Jonathan Isaac was also born in NY but moved to Florida at a young age.
Jonathan Isaac. He's just injured all the time.
"Three of these players are starters: Markelle Fultz, Evan Fournier, and Jonathan Isaac.  Three of these players are out indefinitely or until next season: Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac, and Al-Farouq Aminu.  Just depressing to watch."
Jonathan Isaac if he wasn’t injured
Superstar Jonathan Isaac has very bad knees
That's what could have been said about last year then Simmons Jonathan Isaac and Sabonis got injured and half the Nets team was out with COVID resulting in 3 sweeps :/  Hopefully no injuries this year though I would love to see a Bam and Sabonis duel in a rematch
Anyone else see the resemblance between this guys and Pascal Siakam? I always think they are similar type of players. Jonathan Isaac too
"Individual defense for guards doesn't have much impact on the game. Gobert could average 8 points a game and still have an all-star impact. Patrick Beverley, on the other hand, will never be that impactful.  &gt; everyone values offense over defense  Look at how Paul Millsap got paid. OG Anunoby. Robert Covington. Jonathan Isaac. Thaddeus Young.  Don't compare a shooting PF to a defending PG."
Jonathan Isaac but make him twice as good at everything. That's the best defender in the league who can stay on the floor against anyone and not be schemed out.
"IIRC, Jonathan Isaac tore his doing a similar move as well."
Jonathan isaac had his hyperextension almost a year on the dot and tore his acl in the bubble. Poor markelle and poor orlabdo magic
"It's a euro step. The hop step is the two legged variation, which is supposed to be safer but, interestingly, is how Jonathan Isaac, Markelle's teammate, tore his ACL"
"Yea, if you start a team with KAT, you need a defensive anchor at PF. Someone like a younger Paul Millsap, healthy Jonathan Isaac, Bam, Giannis, or AD."
"Protected: Nikola Vucevic, Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Chuma Okeke, Cole Anthony, Jonathan Isaac  Best Available: Evan Fournier, Khem Birch, Michael Carter Williams"
"Great response, genuinely.   If you want to compare superlatives used about the two you should listen to Taylor’s semi recent podcasts about the playoffs/finals. He seems genuinely shocked at AD’s awareness and mobility and really goes heavy on the modern Bill Russell comparisons, which is basically the most superlative defensive compliment in Ben Taylor’s book:   I do agree that KG was the best perimeter defender of his era amongst bigs but AD is also arguably the best at that among bigs currently. The problem is you’re seeing more and more bigs with KG type mobility so it’s becoming less standout ish in a way. You have guys like Ben Simmons, Giannis, Bam, Jonathan Isaac as well, a collection of 6’11 hyper mobile defensive minded guys the likes we’ve never seen at one time.   Also for DRAPM, it is ultimately an all in one statistic. And clearly has its flaws. On that same list you linked, Jokic is top 20 in DRAPM, Eric Bledsoe has a higher DRAPM than Paul George or Kawhi, and Ricky Rubio is higher than Lebron. None of that makes sense, which puts into question how good of a metric it is at assessing overall defensive impact."
"Finals. Get Jonathan Isaac and Justice Winslow on that team and they’re contenders. JJ redick too. Take out Dudley and Okafor.  Brunson and Crowder can shoot, just add Redick there."
(pre-injury) Jonathan Isaac   Tyrese Haliburton   Lamelo Ball   Ja Morant   Dame   Draymond   Coby White   Aleksej Pokuševski    Zion   Anthony Edwards   Jarrett Allen   Seth Curry
Makes guys like Jarrett Allen and Jonathan Isaac even more impressive
G: Monte Morris G: Paul George F: Got overpaid this summer but Jerami Grant F: Injured but I love Jonathan Isaac C: Richaun Holmes
"Draymond, Simmons, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac"
"2017: Took Josh Jackson over De'Aaron Fox, Jonathan Isaac, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.   2016: Took Dragan Bender over Jamal Murrayand Buddy Hield, and then proceeded to also take Marquese Chriss over Domantas Sabonis."
"I’m not 100% ready to call him a BHI (getting close though..) but IF he is, no religion is an excuse for bigotry. It would be shitty if Jonathan Isaac was denouncing gay people because of his religion."
"Sure, if you're comparing him to like Jokic, Plumlee is a phenomenal athlete. But overall he's nothing special. He plays Center *because* he's so limited athletically. So you can't just compare him to other Centers. Lots of guys about the same size play more athletically demanding positions because they're faster, quicker, more agile and explosive.  Just to name a few -- Ben Simmons, Embiid, Durant, Giannis, AD, Ayton, KAT, Jonathan Isaac, Myles Turner, Michael Porter are all about the same size as Plumlee and way more athletic in every way"
Yeah he would. I also would love to see Jonathan Isaac on Denver. Hes hurt so maybe he could be had on the cheap (cheaper than he would have been anyway) in the off-season. Mpj for ji seems pretty fair to me
"Closest comparison is Jonathan Isaac but Kirilenko had better handles, passing, court vision, BBIQ, and probably durability.  Isaac has better length though, dude can play C if he's stronger and more durable."
"I think Orlando is an even better example at how hard it is to pick outside of the top-2, even if you have a high pick:        2013: Victor Oladipo #2 overall (not bad, but traded him before he broke out)       2014: Aaron Gordon #4 overall         2015: Mario Hezonja #5 overall         2016: Domantas Sabonis #11 overall (traded to OKC)               2017:  Jonathan Isaac #6 overall           2018: Mo Bamba #6 overall"
"I'd say Jonathan Isaac is close, but at least the games I've seen him play, the passing ability and instinct aren't there like him. AK wasn't a Magic Johnson, but man, that dude had court vision and was a good play reader for sure. AK also, not looking at a stats sheet so correct me if I'm wrong, was a better overall offensive player. Well rounded.  He is for sure, one of the closest, if not, the only player near AK."
Jonathan Isaac?
jonathan isaac
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
"Oh sorry I forgot that MVP candidates couldn't lose game, Klay should be the MVP, since he's undefeated this year, all hail Klay but watchout for Jonathan Isaac he's making it close"
Shaq basically just played out his rookie contract in Orlando. Jonathan Isaac has been on the Magic longer than Shaq was
I remember being very happy about getting him out If my IR spot in fantasy. Little I knew...  If Jonathan Isaac were to return this season he could be in this conversation
I can’t wait to draft Jonathan Isaac next season as a sleeper pick
I know he’s not on here but I think jaden McDaniels comparison is Jonathan Isaac
also terrence ross can go fuck himself i hate watching him play like allen fucking iverson for no reason   gg magic im sorry about all the injury woes i really like jonathan isaac and cole anthony
Jonathan Isaac if he can stay healthy
"I've always been a big fan. no one had an Alex smith story this year, but it's good that there's an actual award to give to guys like that. that said, a lot of guys go through a Ben Roethlisberger-esque comeback season. he like destroyed his entire elbow but I think a guy like KD is a shoe in for it with his year.   Steph was held out to ""protect him"" so they could get a better pick. I don't think that's the same as KD or like Jonathan Isaac next year. maybe a guy like Zach Collins could get some shine someday after his issues."
If only they could get Jonathan Isaac (healthy)
They should run Huerter in that lineup (they are now due to injuries) and have him be the secondary playmaker.   Not related but I wish they could trade some of their assets and go after a Jonathan Isaac. Would love a front court of Isaac and Collins
Jonathan Isaac would be a star and the second best player in his draft.
"If you get a chance, tune in. He’s been one of the surprises of the season for me, especially defensively.   I’ve been clamoring for a couple years now about a Jonathan Isaac type big next to KAT. McDaniels looks like he could be that archetype."
"It’s so crazy looking back at what could have been with DSJ. Even after tearing his ACL as a senior he was a top 10 recruit in high school, up with De’Aaron Fox, London Ball, Josh Jackson, Bam Adebayo, Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Jayson Tatum. He then goes to NC State and had a good season, ends up getting drafted 9th overall up there with basically the same stars from his HS class.  People learn how to play defense or shoot 3s later in their career so maybe he could do it. I see the best case for DSJ is to become Lou Williams. The first scoring option off the bench for the 2nd unit, a slasher who also shoots ~35% from 3. Worst case is he ends up being a perpetual 3rd point guard on a team making the minimum."
Markelle Fultz / Cole Anthony   Jalen Green / RJ Hampton  Jonathan Isaac / Terrence Ross or Gary Harris (trade one?)  Chuma Okeke / maybe bring back Ennis?  Wendell Carter Jr / Mo Bamba
"8th highest recruit in the country, that UW team was just... such a disappointment and stopped trying. Which hurt his draft stock but I feel like the talent has always been there.  What’s interesting is I just checked his 247 composite and their pro comparison to him? Jonathan Isaac"
"If he can’t play 5 that severely limits his value to me. I don’t think he has the perimeter defense skills to be a legit 4. The kind of guy defensively that you’re picturing sounds like Jonathan Isaac. A huge lengthy defender who is great in help D. I think Mobley is capable of that aspect of the job but 4s these days have so much perimeter skills that you have to be able to guard well out there. It’s one thing to be a 5 that occasionally switches, but a full time four is almost primarily a perimeter defender at this point."
"Suns picking Dragan Bender and Josh Jackson as 4th overall picks in back to back drafts. Yuck  Some notable players available after them were Jamal Murray, DeArron Fox and Jonathan Isaac.  Oh well the Suns are rolling now and mostly made up for those bad draft selections with Ayton, Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson."
"18 first rounders is a ton, and I think you have to take into account just how random drafting can be. One thing I did that I found quite interesting is just pick any 7 year stretch and use a random number generator to randomly pick a list of 18 first rounders. Almost every time, you end up with a great, multiple time all-star, player.   I did it once from the 2005-2011 draft and got a team with DeMarre Carroll, Joakim Noah, Jrue Holiday and Steph Curryand then did it again with 2012-2018 draft and got Jaylen Brown, Micheal Porter Jr, Jonathan Isaac, Jamal Murray, Clint Capela, and Dennis Schroder.   18 first rounders doesn’t mean that you automatically win a championship, but it definitely means you get a top 10-15 player. You have to get really unlucky to not stumble into at least one elite player."
1. Mitchell 2. Tatum 3. Bam Bam 4. Fox 5. OG Anunoby 6. John Collins 7. Jarrett Allen 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Lonzo 10. Markkanen   Isaac would've probably been higher if not for health.
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Bam Adebayo 3. Donovan Mitchell 4. De’Aaron Fox 5. John Collins 6. OG Anunoby 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Jarrett Allen 10. Derrick White
"Normally this answer screams “Pacers” but Sabonis is a fucking boss. Probably the Magic yeah, unless people are *really* high on Jonathan Isaac."
I think they lacked another true all star. Also Jonathan Isaac and Markelle fultz haven’t had a postseason in the last two years together🤷‍♂️
"Jonathan Isaac stays healthy rest of his career so he can reach his full potential, get a superstar talent in the next two years, make sure these young guys actually turn into something"
"between terrence mann, jonathan isaac, patrick williams, and devin vassell, FSU has had some great nba draft picks lately."
Tracy mcgrady/penny hardaway/ future dpoy Jonathan Isaac
"Yeah, I thought of jonathan isaac in the past. But there aren't too many."
Lonzo or Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac.
"I watched the Magic play last week with almost this exact lineup. I kept saying ""he's still around?!"" Magic fans, what keeps you hopeful for the future? I know Jonathan Isaac and Fultz are nice pieces, but not really the types your build around."
"&gt; is it worth it to run it back with this same team and essentially top out as like a 5-6 seed   No reason that 5-6 is our ceiling to be honest. We have 4 real vets on our roster. Vuc, Fournier, Ross, Gordon. One of gordon and Fournier will be moved for luxury tax reasons. That means next year our 9 man rotation will have 6 players 24 and under.  Fultz, Cole Anthony, chuma okeke, Jonathan Isaac, mo Bamba, and our pick this season. We will likely get another young player in a trade involving gordon or Fournier.   The reason to sell vucevic for picks and young players would be is if we were in need of those things, and we aren’t. If we trade vucevic essentially our entire team will be young players and we resign ourselves to multiple years of being terrible. Magic fans and ownership would much rather we be competitive with room for growth than engaging another hard reset. The minute we trade Vuc we will go looking for a stretch 5 to open the lane for our young guys because Bamba isn’t ready to start. Seems kind of ridiculous to do so when we have an elite on already on the roster.  &gt; Vuc when is value is sky high and getting back potentially some nice draft picks and young talent.  The other part is that his value isn’t going to radically change in the next year. If we’re underperforming next season we can move him at the deadline, he will still have 1.5 years left on his deal at that point."
AD and Jonathan Isaac next season
Good for u . McDaniels is a beast defensively . He reminds me so much of Jonathan Isaac.
"Let’s not overrate Bam here.  Most of his assists come from dribble hand offs to elite to good shooters and he’s not that great of a defender as you’d think, based on the eye test I’ve seen Jonathan Isaac play better."
Jonathan Isaac hyperextended his knee last year and missed 2 months. That’s pretty much a death blow for MVP. Let’s hope it’s just a mild sprain.
Pg: steve nash  Sg: caris levert  Sf: jonathan isaac  Pf: timmy  C: either wilt or ben wallace i dunno
"How can you say that when Giannis, AD, Zion, Randle are here? Then there’s guys like Siakam, John Collins, Jonathan Isaac (when he was healthy, Jaren Jackson Junior at the next tier  Notice how diverse their skill sets are, it’s not your traditional post up 6’10 6’11 guys on the block anymore, because the game shifted away from that toward spacing, ability to switch and defend in open space and recover, speed and versatile matters more on both ends, if anything it’s the birth of new era versatile Forwards."
"I'm not sure but I think the perfect types of pieces around Ingram and Zion look something like Malcolm Brogdon, Mikal Bridges and Jonathan Isaac. At least two of our starting 5 would need to be pretty great level defensive players but it to work on that end. The reality is we run a pretty legitimate offense even if the roster is a shambles, I just wouldn't be shifting Ingram so soon."
"&gt;Based on their defensive skill sets.  So which skills? What about their defensive skill sets makes Fournier better.   &gt;In a death lineup scenario the lakers would have AD and Lebron on the floor to guard guys who can physically overpower Fournier  Teams are going to hunt the weak defender like Tor and Mil did the past 2 postseasons. Having AD and LeBron to help helps alot(so did Jonathan Isaac in 2019) but your still introducing a weak link and area they can attack to begin with.   For reference [you can look up from 2014-20 how much any defender spent on the opponents no 1, no 2, no 3 option](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/knarsu3/). For last season the following are guys who spent more time guarding the opponents highest usage player than Fournier: Tim Hardaway, Elfrid Payton, Rodney Hood, Dillon Brooks, Glenn Robinson. Are any of these close to high quality defenders? No. There alot of really good defenders who guard the best option alot but it by itself doesnt tell you much.  &gt;we’ve been a top 10 defense each of the last two years  Im on CTG looking at the Magic's defensive rating when Fournier has been on the court the past 2 yrs:   This yr: 29th percentile Last yr: 51st percentile  This isnt about arguing about the merits of defensive metrics, on/off data etc. It's just to tell you factually when Fournier has been on the court they havent been at that defensive level overall. They are that kind of defense because of the minutes when he's not on the court."
"How tf am I slow when it's the other guy saying ""yall bring blm into everything"" and now defending it by saying he is against blm. Tell Jonathan Isaac that he's against blm too then. You're reaching for the low hanging fruit here bud."
jonathan isaac
Orlando's Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac.
"Jonathan Isaac a bit - has the defensive chops as a 3-4, probably going to be slightly better scorer than AK, although weight/muscle gain might make him bigger / more of a straight 4 in the near future."
Not to take away from your point but Jonathan Isaac stood too
"Not kneeling=doesn’t understand the struggles that black Americans face? Jonathan Isaac also didn’t kneel for the anthem, I’d say he probably understands what it’s like to be black. Meyers publicly acknowledged the struggles black Americans faced and also gave his reasons for not kneeling, reasons his teammates were supportive of. I’m not sure what that has to do with him being shitty and saying an anti-Semitic slur in this instance though"
My vote goes to jonathan isaac
"Not disagreeing, but Jonathan Isaac didn’t either"
"He wasn’t the only player not to kneel, Jonathan Isaac as well iirc"
"I think Jonathan Isaac also didn’t kneel, but yah... not a good look for Leonard."
"I mean Jonathan Isaac also didn't kneel, he said it was against his religion."
"[No because ""Black lives are supported through the Gospel""](https://news.sky.com/story/jonathan-isaac-orlando-magic-star-explains-why-he-didnt-kneel-in-honour-of-black-lives-matter-12040372)"
Jonathan Isaac when healthy deserves a shout
A fit Jonathan Isaac is a better defender 1-5
"I love superstars like Steph, Lebron, KD, Dame, etc., but my favorite players are never those guys.  The players I've had the most joy in watching in the last decade are guys who weren't (\*yet\* in some cases) even very good:   **Rookie Giannis**\--I watched every Bucks game just because he was liable to do sth I'd never seen at any given moment.   **Jonathan Isaac**\--just iso watching him on D is more exciting than most things on TV.   **Chris Bouchet**\--he weird. Trebuchet 3 shooter/shot blocker/stringbean.   **Tyrese Halliburton**\--not ""exciting"" like some of the others, but watching him figure out what's happening on the floor faster than the vets all around him is pretty amazing.   **Will Barton**\--all knees and elbows and ill-advised shots, with a nose for the ball off the glass and a love of leaping before he looks.   **LaMelo Ball**\--he does stuff nobody else does and it's freaky watching him sus out plays ahead of everyone else on the court."
"Not even trying to be a homer, but Jonathan Isaac and Jaren Jackson, but no Julius Randle? Also, LaMelo at 30?!!"
the Magic have been utterly steamrolled by injuries. feels like not many people talk about how fucked the past few seasons have been for y'all. Jonathan Isaac still has top-25 potential if he can come back healthy IMO
"Skill boost Jonathan Isaac give him some better handles and scoring abilities makes him an automatic all nba guy if he can stay healthy.     Height boost I guess Cole, makes Him about 6’6 would help with finishing and shooting over smaller guards.  Athletic boost I guess to Chuma, give him some more bounce and stuff."
Julius Randle give me hope for Jonathan Isaac.
Yeah this type of player is the ideal 4 for the modern NBA and in high demand. I think a healthy Jonathan Isaac would be the perfect 4 next to Sabonis.
"He needs a Jonathan Isaac, RoCo, Draymond type of 4 I think. Really good help defender who can block shots."
"&gt;In your opinion, if the wolves can strenghten one position with an all star type player, what position would you choose? PG?  I mean considering we got D'lo and Ant as the backcourt I wouldn't really consider adding an all star PG.   So PF ideally. Jonathan Isaac,Ben Simmons (at PF not PG),Siakam. That type of player would fit a loooooot of our problems."
Jonathan Isaac I miss you
Jonathan Isaac got the cheek bones of gorgeous Squidward.
"Pascal Siakam, Jonathan Isaac or Larry Nance Jr."
Jonathan Isaac claims 2026
You have Jonathan Isaac and Fultz at least  And Will prolly get 2-5 in the draft this year
"Jonathan Isaac, Fultz, and Cole Anthony all have promise"
"That makes sense to me apart from the Nurk comparison imo. Allen is a better rim protector/finisher and more of a lob threat than Nurk is, but Nurk is a much better passer and it’s not close. Also, hopefully Okoro can blossom into that kind of defensive wing that they need. He’s a little under sized at SF but he’s shown some promise and if he can knock down open 3s at a higher rate things may start to click. Kevin Love has to go though, they need a younger PF that can move his feet and hit 3s, maybe through the draft. Like a JJJ or Jonathan Isaac would be sick for this team"
"Yezzir. I think Cole is gonna be their future 6th man. Brings a lot of energy and offense. The magic could really have a fantastic foundation for their rebuild if the lottery goes their way.  PG: Fultz/Cole/MCW  SG: Jalen Green/ Gary Harris /RJ Hampton  SF: Jonathan Isaac/ Ross/ Bacon  PF: Chuma/ Draft pick  C: WCJ/ Bamba  Obviously not even close to being a contender, but a really nice foundation for their rebuild."
Him and Jonathan Isaac are going to be good when the Bulls picks pan out
"&gt; feels like I’m forgetting someone  Not suprising since he hasn't played in forever, but imo Jonathan Isaac is definitely up there when healthy."
TIL: Glinda is Jonathan Isaac.
You mean like Jonathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon.  Let's not pretend like we didn't pair him with 2 defensive minded bigs at the same time.
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
He averaged 31 and 16 on 65% TS against a god awful 8th-seeded Magic team lacking Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac. He then went on to average 22 and 11 on 55% TS against the Miami Heat. Monster statlines don't really matter unless you're actually playing a good team.
Jonathan Isaac DPOY in 2-3 years manifest it
KD with the all time great inspiring performance. His defense in this game is going to get overlooked but goodness did he look like Jonathan Isaac at times out there.
Jonathan Isaac becomes the next DPOY and MVP candidate
man nuggets really need a Jonathan Isaac type player to cover for Jokic on the defensive end
"Superstars: Players in their prime that have won league MVP or played at an MVP level in the Regular Season, Playoffs, and/or both.   - Bron Bron  - KD - Jokic - Kawhi - Curry - Harden - Giannis  - Luka  - Street Clothes  - Kyrie  - Dame  - Embiid   Bron Bron:   &gt; Draymond Green   KD:  &gt;   Kawhi:  &gt; PJ Tucker (check the stats)   Curry:  &gt; Dillon Brooks cuz I can’t remember who else really slows him down 1v1   Harden:  &gt; Wes Matthews   Jokic:  &gt; DeAndre Ayton (No, it ain’t just recency bias nephews)   Giannis:  &gt; ~~The freethrow line~~ Just kidding, probably Jonathan Isaac   Embiid:  &gt; Marc Gasol aka Big Daddy Spain  Luka:  &gt; Porzingis   AD:  &gt; Draymond Green   Kyrie:  &gt; No idea. Any ideas?  Dame:  &gt; Jrue Holiday"
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
"Jonathan Isaac was looking great and then tore his ACL. Had he not gotten that injury, only Mitchell and Adebayo would've gone above him in a redraft and he would've been picked before Jackson, Ball, and Fultz."
"Simmons, Draymond, Bam, AD, Jonathan Isaac, Giannis. Kawhi, Thybulle, Butler are close but their frames are a little too slight for bigger 5s though."
"I know this will never happen because of the picks and cap space and whatnot, but seeing Kristaps go to the Magic for Jonathan Isaac and Terence Ross could be cool. It bolsters the Mavs defense a little and gives depth to their bench."
Apparently no one can have a healthy Jonathan Isaac. ^pleasestayhealthy
"They CANNOT have him, but a healthy Jonathan Isaac would be perfect for that team IMO."
Too bad Jonathan Isaac is injured
Jonathan Isaac
the disrespect to jonathan isaac and chuma okeke
"Jonathan Isaac has never played a full season of basketball, hard to develop him as a first option when he’s never on the court. I wouldn’t call Vucevic a middling vet though lol"
I don’t think a fully actualized Jonathan Isaac is a high-volume offensive player. His skill set is defense. Him being low-usage isn’t some failure in coaching philosophy.
"Given that he doesn’t do much with the talent he has, I doubt he will. Jonathan Isaac was probably the highest upside prospect on the Magic and in his third year he got under ten shots a game and was tied for 7th/8th in usage with MCW. Not going to raise your ceiling with a coach who rides middling vets for a couple extra regular season wins."
Non superstars only  Ja Morant  Cam Johnson  Cole Anthony  Jonathan Isaac
Popular radio host in Boston said that Tatum was garbage and Jonathan Isaac is who we should have taken. He pretty much held on to that idea until recently.
"Jonathan Isaac, LaMelo, Ant, sure. Agreed.  But hear me out: POKU"
"What do you dislike about Jonathan Isaac as a player/piece for a team?  He’s a limited usage wing stopper with good rim protection, offering versatile help defense that can be the backbone of a premiere team defense, but not particularly great rebounding and shooting that is more conceptual than born out by the percentages, though he has better guard skills than your typical seven footer, showing some modicum of creation potential as he’s able to put the ball on the floor."
Also forgot to add this but Jonathan Isaac is being slept on ridiculously hard and will be the best defensive player in the league in a year or two imo
"IDK Tweeners can be hugely effective, look at guys like Jonathan Isaac, Collins obviously lacks his agility and ability, but I really think Collins just hasn’t been able to consistently stay on the court, a lot of young players careers get derailed due to inability to have playing time to develop, Collins was raw with high potential and good advanced numbers, but he never really could string enough playing time together or actually grow or develop his game.    Now it is years down the line and you’re being asked to pick up the check on a project that you’re still waiting to deliver on potential, and sunk cost fallacy creeps up with the roster salaries weighing heavy.  Ultimately the Blazers need to retain him and hope he turns around and puts his injury problems behind him and improves as a player, because the franchise has painted itself into a corner and it doesn’t have too many points of variability.    They need to roll the dice on Collins because while the odds he hits that advanced stats darling ceiling are getting slimmer with each passing day, aside from him they’ve got precious little assets which might change in value and outperform their contracts- Little, Simons, and Collins are the young pieces that circumstances have the Blazers hoping they can grow to be the X factor."
"Because Myles Turner,Gobert, Jonathan Isaac etc have a bigger impact on the game overall and the team than Duncan or any other really good shooter."
Immanuel Quickley will be an All Star  Jonathan Isaac DPOY   Kawhi Leonard will go down as a top 10 player of all time
"I can't weigh in on your Q, but I love Jonathan Isaac. Maybe my favorite player to watch when he's healthy."
Jonathan Isaac when he returns is going to be darn close to a mix of both of these philosophies.
Early favorite next year could easily be Jonathan Isaac or Fultz. Someone on Orlando has to be the first option between the knee bros.
"jayson tatum, de'aaron fox, jonathan isaac, donovan mitchell, bam adebayo, john collins, jarret allen, og anunoby, derrick white, dillon brooks"
Jonathan Isaac if healthy
Paul Millsap like five years ago did that job pretty well. Also Jonathan Isaac but he’s hurt
Jonathan isaac
Imagine if a healthy Jonathan Isaac is on this Mavs team 🤤🤤
that's Jonathan Isaac music
Jonathan Isaac.
Jonathan Isaac going to comeback from his knee injury with the wrath of god
Who else am I supposed to cut? Jonathan Isaac?
"We agree, based on what’s known now you’d rather have Ingram.  Hypothetical: Mitchell wants out of Utah and the offers on the table are Jimmy Butler &amp; two 1st, or a package of Jonathan Isaac, Fultz, Okeke, &amp; 2 1st. Which do you take, knowing you’re job is to build a winning team."
"EAST  - Giannis wins a Championship with the Bucks - Bulls eventually trade Lavine - Cavaliers make the playoffs once - Ime Udoka doesn't last as Celtics coach  - Capela is still a Hawk  - The Heat never make the finals again - LaMelo gets 3rd team All NBA honors - The Knicks never win a playoff series  - Jonathan Isaac never gets healthy  - KD wins 2 titles with the Nets - Goga Bitadze is the next Gobert - Isaiah Stewart leads the league in rebounds at least once - Vanvleet will be the only Raptor still with the team - Sixers sign Kyle Lowry - Somehow someway Bradley Beal never leaves the Wizards   WEST  - Lillard never leaves Portland - Paul George is still a Clipper - Jaren Jackson Jr is a bust - Gordon Hayward returns to Utah - The Kings still haven't made the playoffs, Fox gets traded to the East - Lebron surpasses Kareem as all time leading scorer and retires as a Cavalier - Luka and Mavs never makes it past the 2nd round  - Michael Porter Jr leads his team in points - Zion never participates in dunk contest, Pelicans make it to the playoffs twice - Rockets never make it to the playoffs - Gregg Popovich retires in 2 years - Mikal Bridges wins MIP - SGA demands trade from the Thunder - The Wolves finally make the playoffs at least once - Steph Curry leads the Warriors to the finals but loses"
"When we drafted Aaron Gordon, Hezonja, Jonathan Isaac. The picks above us, Embiid, Porzingis and Trae Young"
"Yeah I dont know if it's betterthan Lebrons block on Iggy which maybe the best block of all time lol but it deserves to be somewhere on that shelf. I saw that block and immediately thought ""yeah let's hold onto Jonathan Isaac for as long as we can"" lol"
Zion Luka Jonathan Isaac  Donovan mitchell Tatum
"Jonathan Isaac when healthy is no. 1 IMO. Other than that, probably Giannis Draymond and AD followed by Gobert"
Anthony davis and maybe a healthy Jonathan isaac
Trade Jonathan Isaac for Marvin Bagley cowards
"Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja"
"If Jonathan Isaac could stay healthy maybe he could, but yea not many guys on the list of players who are long and athletic enough to potentially make a play like that."
"Where does he fit in?   Markelle Fultz, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Kuminga, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Cole Anthony, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chume Okeke, Mo Bamba.   That's before adding in their 8th pick, looks like Franz Wagner currently.   Honestly, I think they should be looking to wheel and deal Harris and/or Ross."
is Jonathan Isaac really thought of that highly. I would have him 30th
1. Nets - Kevin Durant 2. Bucks - Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Lakers - LeBron James 4. Warriors - Stephen Curry 5. Clippers - Kawhi Leonard 6. Nuggets - Nikola Jokic 7. 76ers - Joel Embiid 8. Mavericks - Luka Doncic 9. Blazers - Damian Lillard 10. Celtics - Jayson Tatum 11. Suns - Chris Paul 12. Heat - Jimmy Butler 13. Hawks - Trae Young 14. Wolves - Karl-Anthony Towns 15. Pelicans - Zion Williamson 16. Jazz - Donovan Mitchell 17. Wizards - Bradley Beal 18. Bulls - Zach Lavine 19. Thunder - Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander 20. Kings - De’Aaron Fox 21. Knicks - Julius Randle 22. Pacers - Domantas Sabonis 23. Raptors - Kyle Lowry 24. Grizzlies - Ja Morant 25. Spurs - DeMar DeRozan 26. Cavaliers - Collin Sexton 27. Magic - Jonathan Isaac 28. Rockets - Christian Wood 29. Pistons - Jerami Grant 30. Hornets - LaMelo Ball  This was tough
markelle fultz  cole anthony  rj hampton  chuma okeke  jonathan isaac  mo bamba  wendell carter jr  top picks coming  very exciting to me
Oh him and Jonathan Isaac definitely gonna get into it year at some point once Isaac starts going off on one of his galaxy brain takes
"While Jonathan Isaac is a good shot blocker, Terrence Ross is too. Ross is also a good slasher and 3pt shooter. Plus it may be biased a little cause I love watching him play and don’t care that much for Jonathan Isaac."
"Terrence Ross over Jonathan Isaac, Julius Randle over Derrick Rose and Pascal Siakam over Kyle Lowry. The other 27 I agree with."
Lol I have Orlando at number 1. I think they’re in a good position to do things. Plus Jonathan Isaac coming back and I’m hopeful he lights it up
Probably thought that our anchor is Jonathan Isaac and not Kristaps Porzingis.
"&gt;I think an interesting trade target would be Jonathan Isaac. It’s a gamble, but if he works out his health issues, a front court of Isaac and KAT is absolutely perfect on paper.   Magic would never deal him, especially since they traded away Vuc and Gordon."
"I think an interesting trade target would be Jonathan Isaac. It’s a gamble, but if he works out his health issues, a front court of Isaac and KAT is absolutely perfect on paper."
"obviously i’m a little biased, but jonathan isaac. probably not mvp but definitely all star/dpoy"
Jonathan Isaac.
JONATHAN ISAAC!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When Jonathan Isaac went up for 42 points and the game winner in game 5 it was crazy.
"a pretty big selection of young guys to develop and try building around, on top of 2 top 10 picks this year along with all their picks + the bulls pick coming up  young players with potential: markelle fultz, jonathan isaac, cole anthony, chuma okeke, rj hampton, wendell carter jr, mo bamba. not a bad start"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05MkuDquZ5U  Jonathan Isaac had one in january. Ruled no structural damage. posterior lateral corner injury and a medial bone contusion. Came back in the bubble 5 months later and tore his acl in that leg.
"Posted this elsewhere:  Not to be a downer but Jonathan Isaac had a horrific looking knee injury in january of last season similar to giannis. He was also ruled to have 'no structural damage', diagnosed with 'posterior lateral corner injury and a medial bone contusion.' and he didn't return until the bubble where he proceeded to tear his acl in that same knee in his second official game back.  https://www.nba.com/news/jonathan-isaac-hyperextended-knee-injury  We were told that the ACL injury wasn't related to the january incident, but either way 'no structural damage' doesn't mean he'll be back playing soon. JI's inital prognosis was re-evlauation in 8-10 weeks."
"Reminds me a bit of Jonathan Isaac in instincts, physical tools, sweet hair, and athleticism."
It’s the fact that it’s not really practical to get an MRI on the spot in the dead of night and that there’s not really enough to be gained from rushing the process that makes it worth trying to overcome that obstacle.   Case in point: Jonathan Isaac got his MRI immediately after the game late at night in the bubble because they had a facility on site- eliminating the logistical barriers that would typically exist in such a circumstance.
"I don’t know why you’re so adamant about dying on this hill.   They don’t get MRIs in the middle of the night because it’s impractical and a logistical hurdle, and there isn’t enough incentive to expedite the process to warrant overcoming that hurdle. It’s that simple.   It’s not about waiting a specific amount of time after injury. Football players get same day MRIs after suffering injuries at practice all the time. The Bengals have an MRI machine and a radiologist on site. (https://local12.com/amp/health/health-updates/bengals-one-of-the-few-teams-with-an-onsite-imaging-center)  In the bubble they had an MRI machine on site, and when Jonathan Isaac suffered his ACL tear he got an MRI immediately after the game. (https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1290090451832197120?s=20)"
"&gt;Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, who suffered a hyperextended left knee during the first quarter of Wednesday’s game against the Washington Wizards, will be out indefinitely and re-evaluated in eight-to-10 weeks.   i assume severity varies like other injuries though"
We had Jonathan Isaac covering a lot of his defensive issues in the paint tbf
James Wiseman for Jonathan Isaac trade is a wrap if this happens.
Liked him on the Jazz. But also here is a list of #6 picks from all drafts that currently still have an active player:  Onyeka Okongwu  Jarrett Culver  Mo Bamba  Jonathan Isaac  Buddy Hield  Willie Cauley-Stein  Marcus Smart  Nerlens Noel  Damian Lillard  Jan Vesely  Ekpe Udoh  Jonny Flynn  Danilo Gallinari  Yi Jianlian  Brandon Roy  Martell Webster  Josh Childress  Chris Kaman  Dajuan Wagner
"&gt; Always making the playoffs with low-mid 30 wins  Idk why people keep saying this, we've made the playoffs exactly twice since Dwight - last year and the year before. Everyone acts like we've been the 8th seed for a decade. It's bizzare. Even before the bubble playoffs (so literally ONE playoff appearance) people were saying the same thing...  The other years we didn't just miss out of the playoffs either, we were straight bad (bottom 5 every year except 2016 (11th, still bad) and the playoff appearances) and then unlucky with draft slots and terrible trades by the previous FO. If you look at our drafts since Dwight, we've always moved down or stayed put and just out of reach of franchise talent.  https://i.redd.it/ncc5bvz3rx671.jpg  * 2013 - Oladipo (good pick but bad trade by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job)  * 2014 - AG - we miss out on Embiid by one pick because we move down in the draft.  * 2015 - Mario - we miss out on Porzingis by one pick * 2016 - Pick becomes Sabonis, but traded by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job * 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down * 2018 -  Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down * 2019 - Chuma - Great pick * 2020 - Cole - Good pick * 2021 - We probably take Kuminga, missing out on the perimeter scorer we desperately need (Green/Suggs/Cade) by one slot, because we move down...again.  It's silly to try and say retrospectively they should have drafted a Devin Booker (13th pick) or an MPJ (14th pick) or SGA (11th pick) with a 5th pick. We've simply been unlucky and haven't had any franchise talent simply fall into our laps like some of these other teams. The trades made by the previous FO deserve the criticsm and Hennigan should have been canned much earlier, but it is what it is."
Please give us Jonathan Isaac.
Jonathan Isaac when healthy is the best defender in the league
"I know it frustrating but Jonathan kuminga has the potential to be really special. 6’8”ish (although some sites say he’s 6’6”) but has the potential to be a great two way player with the right development. Him (potentially), okeke, Fultz and Isaac is not a bad core"
"Good shout on the Magic.   Cade Cunningham, Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Jonathan Isaac, Wendell Carter Jr.   Markelle Fultz, RJ Hampton, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke and Mo Bamba.   That's a really promising team, and I do wonder if they then see what they can get for the likes of Ross and Harris."
Jonathan Isaac? What?
I'd rather have Jonathan Isaac don't @ me
"Kinda an impossible list... I'll do some tiers.  Tier A: Draymond, Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid.  \-These are the absolutely elite guys, the guys who don't get played off no matter what happens and might be so good at D they change what the other teams offense does.  Tier B: Rudy Gobert, Paul George, Playoff Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Bam Adebayo, Pascal Siakam, Kawhi Leonard, OG Anunoby, Klay Thompson, JJJ, Deandre Ayton, Dejounte Murray, Jonathan Isaac.  \-Really great players who aren't quite as game warping as the top group. On their best day, they affect the game much more than most, but is every game their best game? I would say sorta yes, sorta no. This is the ""clearly above average"" group.  Tier C: Lu Dort, Aaron Gordon, Matisse Thybulle, Royce O Neal, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Hunter, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Beverly, Alex Caruso, KCP, Derrick White  \-They not getting paid for offense and they will never expect paychecks for that. They are all above average players on D, and at times can be Tier A guys, but much of the time they aren't and there's no shame to that.  I'm 100% sure I'm missing guys. My biggest issue is where to put Jonathan Isaac."
"If Collin Sexton, Jerami Grant, or Jonathan Isaac were my franchise player, I'd probably stop watching basketball for a few years."
I totally forgot about Jonathan Isaac! He was/is a beast defensively. For sure added him to the list. I really hope he can come back 95%-100% to form.
"I’m ready to fight, you put mitchel Robinson but left out the future Orlando Magic legend, Jonathan Isaac. Remember how good he was doing before he tore his acl in the bubble?"
I loooove watching Jonathan Isaac on defense
Drafted in the same year as Luka while being good at defense? Jonathan Isaac it is
Jonathan Isaac.
"I don't think anyone is sleeping on the Hornets, but I think they'll be as good as the 6th seed, floor is 9th. Graham being gone might actually help them not have a log jam at guard, but I looked him on this team.  I think the Rockets and Pacers are good sleepers.  I really like the players the Rockets have like Christian Wood, John Wall, Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr among others, and their head coach.  I don't like how the roster had played over the last few seasons for the Pacers, but Rick Carlisle is a big reason why I think they could surprise people.   I want to say the Magic so bad, but Jonathan Isaac will be out a lot of the season, but Fultz is coming back with Cole and Suggs. They still have Ross and MCW off the bench too, but I know nothing about Jamahl Mosley"
"Zach Collins, Jonathan Isaac, both guys that any team in the league would want for their bench if healthy. Both guys who are never healthy."
"Spurs: Idk, probably Dejounte Murray  Magic: Jonathan Isaac when he’s healthy. Other than that, I think it’s Wendell Carter Junior."
Jonathan Isaac is arguably one of the best shot blockers in the association (but he is coming off of injury which I assume is why he’s off the list).
"PG - Ben Simmons  SG - Andre Roberson   SF - Rondae Hollis-Jefferson  PF - Jonathan Isaac  C - Bam Adebayo  Bench - Kris Dunn, Matisse Thybulle, Derrick Jones Jr, Michael Kidd-Gilchrest,  Nerlens Noel.   I'm not sure how this team would ever score, but I think they could win one defensive slugfest against a bad team where they just hold them to like 80 and get a bunch of transition buckets"
Jonathan Isaac  To the Kings
"No, not really.    By pick #6 the draft is becoming a lot more of a crapshoot.  Just at #6 the last few years - Okongwu (too early, but not the greatest start), Culver, Mo Bamba, Jonathan Isaac (good player but injury train wreck thus far), Buddy Hield, Willy Cauley Stein.  Like - that isn't exactly a shining crop of players at #6 last few years.  Even if you go back a few more years it's hit or (more) miss - Smart, Noel, Lillard, Veseley, Udoh, Johnny Flynn.  Long story short - I don't think anyone is even eligible for ""biggest busts in modern NBA history"" if they weren't a Top 3 pick."
"Homer pick, but Jonathan Isaac makes watching defense fun, singlehandedly. It's amazing how much of an impact one guy can have on a defense.  Also the Magic generally will be super young, playing super fast, and hopefully playing super hard. Probably not a lot of wins, but should be a fun team nonetheless."
"Jonathan Isaac, Tyrese Haliburton and MPJ"
Jonathan Isaac.
Jonathan Isaac. He's been plagued by injuries but I think he'll bounce back this upcoming season
Jonathan Isaac
"OG Anunoby, Deandre Hunter, Milan Bridges, Jonathan Isaac, Patrick Williams"

Jonathan Isaac  I think he could be better than Ben Wallace.

Chuma Okeke. Want to say Jonathan Isaac too but that is more main stream with people talking about his dpoty potential when healthy.   Why are people saying Ben Simmons? Is he not already an all star and all defensive talent? Lmao
"Jalen Suggs ROY, Jonathan Isaac all defense"
Jonathan Isaac wins DPOY
"**MVP**: **Kevin Durant**. Best player on the best team, now with chemistry. I think he will eclipse his GSW stats considerably because Brooklyn isn't afraid to play iso. Don't buy the stars cancel out theory. Steph up there as well.  **DPOY: Giannis Antetokounmpo.** I think Gobert (unfairly)  will get docked for being somewhat exposed on the perimeter. I don't think anyone else will genuinely be in the running. I think Jonathan Isaac will be a conversation, but no chance of winning.  **6MOY: Dennis Schroder**, I think Payton Pritchard will start at PG.  **ROTY: Jalen Green**, with Suggs close behind. Cade will get Dwane Casey'd for at least first half of the season.  **MIP: Jonathan Isaac**. Maybe a homer pick, but could be Orlando's leading scorer. He has a lot of offensive game he hasn't really unleashed because he plays like a pastor, and was starting to turn around his mentality before the injury.  **COTY: Billy Donovan**, I think the Bulls are being underrated because none of the names are splashy individually, but when you break it down each player is going into the best fit of his career offensively. Billy Donovan has historically gotten good team defences out of bad individual defenders. IMO they will be a top 3 seed in the East, behind the Bucks and Nets.  **Exec of the Year: Arturas Karnisovas** - see above.  **Champions: Nets (KD)** - Talent."

jonathan isaac is already a DPOY caliber player he just has to stay healthy
Jonathan Isaac probably
"Malcolm Brogdon  Jamal Murray  Jonathan Isaac  Jaren Jackson Jr  Myles Turner   An Isaac, Jackson, Turner lineup is my dream. OG and VanVleet coming off the bench."
Jonathan Isaac DPOY. Calling it now
"In a return to the court, Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz collide and suffer a rare double acl injury.   Using the injured player exception, the Magic sign former assists leader Shelving Mack and local legend Tacko Fall  (Ok the last part would be fine, I was just thinking about the longest player available)"
Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac 10x DPOTY winner
A healthy Jonathan Isaac would have been a perennial member of the first team all defense team
Jonathan Isaac
"PG: Darius Garland/ KPJ SG: SGA SF: Cade Cunningham  PF: Jerami Grant C: Jonathan Isaac or Jarrett Allen  Being hopeful here that Cade is as advertised and what Isaac showed before getting hurt is real. I think this lineup is good enough for at least a second round appearance assuming they don’t run into 76ers, Bucks, or Nets.   Coaching is the real difference maker here"
I wanna see a Cole Anthony - Markelle Fultz - Jalen Suggs backcourt exceed expectations this year. I have high hopes for all three and if Jonathan Isaac can stay healthy y'all will be fun at the very least. So many fast breaks if they buy in on defense.
Jonathan Isaac. He was about to be super dank
And Jonathan Isaac same draft class as Zach Collins but has only played 136 games. Zach has 154.
"$7.3M/year. He played 66, 77, 11 and 0 games in his 4 year career. That 2017 draft class was super hit or miss. A 3 year deal is puzzling to me but I guess he's only 23.  **FUN FACT:** Collins has played 16 more games than fellow draftmate Jonathan Isaac."
No way Detroit trades him unless we give them multiple picks. At that point I'd rather go for Jonathan Isaac or Myles Turner if we are offering a package like that.
Jalen Suggs and Jonathan Isaac gonna be amazing for us in a couple years you right
"Scorer is easily Zion. He's probably a top 5 scorer in the NBA. Defender I'd say Jonathan Isaac or Bam, probably Isaac. Playmaker is Luka or Trae, probably Luka."
&gt;He recently updated his recovery. Jonathan Isaac is set to return at some point during the 2022 season. When is not exactly known and the Magic will not put a timeline on his — or Markelle Fultz's return.  https://orlandomagicdaily.com/2021/06/22/orlando-magic-forward-jonathan-isaac-believes-turned-corner/
When’s Jonathan Isaac back tho?
"Minnesota should be on the list for John Collins (S+T), but I bet he re-signs with Atlanta too.    My prediction is Minnesota will sign or trade for a F/C that no one thinks they’ll get.  Could sign JaMychal Green to the MLE, could trade for Jarrett Allen, Myles Turner, Jonathan Isaac, etc.     Something is definitely in the works."
Jonathan Isaac is the best defender under 25. He’s one of few guys that can legitimately guard 1-5.
Jonathan Isaac is the best defender
&gt;Was  Jonathan Isaac; 1997-2021
You forgot Jonathan Isaac once he's healthy
how do you forget Jonathan Isaac
"Missing the most important part of our core, Jonathan Isaac. Also Markelle, Okeke, Hampton look very promising"
German Jonathan Isaac then?
"The problem is that he's not a good-but-not-great player with four more years of max money.   This rules out the teams at the top competing to win next year. Mayyyybe Golden State would trade Wiggins and 7, but I bet they'd rather run things back with everyone back healthy next year.  For the teams building for the future, they'll take the contract but will want picks coming to them, rather than going the other way. Nobody is going to move out of the top 4 while also giving up an asset.  That kind of leaves the ""usual suspects"" type teams of Sacramento, Orlando, and Minnesota.  Minnesota doesn't have a first rounder but maybe would do D-LO and next year's first. Towns is too good and Edwards has too much potential.  Orlando has 5 and 8 and just got rid of all their big contracts to start a rebuild. Best case for Philly I guess would be Jonathan Isaac and 5 for Simmons and some future firsts or swaps.  Sacramento is at pick 9 and would probably do that and Buddy Hield for Simmons because who knows what the hell they're up to."
"Jonathan Isaac. An absolute defensive juggernaut, if he can learn to stay healthy and polish his offensive game then the Magic have an all-time great in their hands."
Kevin Love - therapist  Malcolm Brogdon - lawyer  Damian Lillard - entrepreneur  Kyrie Irving - political activist  Jonathan Isaac - pastor
they had to make a hot fix to jonathan isaac or he would've been too OP
"Their last drafts have been fine.   Cole Anthony, Chuma Okeke, Jonathan Isaac were all good picks. Bamba, maybe not."
"Kawhi Leonard, Jrue Holiday, Jonathan Isaac, Marcus Smart, De,Aaron Fox and Paul George are all some of my favorite players. If you couldnt tell I enjoy watching good perimeter defense"
"Yup, I agree. Dude started out last season in the preseason on fire, looked worthy of the pick. Then everything went to shit, he got handed too much responsibility, and it went downhill incredibly fast. He’s also an extremely religious dude which is why I’d love to see him with Jonathan Isaac, I think he’d be a great influence both for Culver’s mental and physical progression"
Ηοw is Jonathan Isaac?  Will he be back for the new season?
"People talk about all the most formidable 5s being from other countries, but the US still has the undisputed best depth there, AD, Adebayo, Jarrett Allen, Dwight Howard, Myles turner, jonathan Isaac..just too many injuries and sit outs this year.  This roster is a mix of America’s B or C team plus Durant. Still medal favorites.  Would love it if stars saw the olympics as an opportunity to flex their pesky defense skills without worrying about getting gassed. Would be fun to see a defensively minded roster. The league’s 12 best defenders would probably be an offensively decent squad anyway."

Immanuel Quickley   Cam Johnson  Nassir Little  1 Jonathan Isaac will be a DPOY candidate if he can stay healthy finally.  Shai is gonna be thought of as a top 15 player next year
Jonathan Isaac too.   https://youtu.be/HW6X2WAkrFM
Jonathan Isaac wins DPOY
"I agree it's a plenty good enough offer, but calling McDaniel's the fifth best player on a 23 win team is misrepresenting value like it would be to reduce Evan mobley to the fifth best player on a 22 win team. From what I've seen of mcdaniels, he looks like he can be every bit as good as Jonathan Isaac. My issue with him isn't his quality as a trade piece, but that he doesn't fit Embiids timeline that well."
How come Jonathan Isaac still isn't nearly ready over a year since his injury now? Do ACL injuries usually take this long?
Brandon Ingram Jonathan Isaac Paul George Karl Anthony Towns
He's pretty good yeah. I do think our fanbase tends to overrate his ceiling a bit or at least how likely it is that he gets there though. Good defensive switchable 3/4 that can hit a respectable % from 3 is a very valuable player. Jonathan Isaac is a pretty decent comparison if you haven't seen him play.
Example answer:  PG: Patrick Beverly (6th on Wolves)  SG: Buddy Hield (4th on Kings)   SF: OG Anunoby (3rd on Raptors)  PF: Jonathan Isaac (2nd for Magic)  C: Nikola Jokic (1st on Nuggets)  6TH: Eric Gordon (5th on Rockets)   Bench: Lauri Markennen (7th on Cavs)   Xth/nd would be there rank on there respective team. The player doesn’t have to be that exact number like Kyrie is the bird best player on the nets but you could take him as your first best.
"PG: Chris Paul, Davion Mitchell SG: Devin Booker, Lu Dort SF: Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac PF: Draymond Green, Christian Wood C:   Joel Embiid, Al Horford"
"PG: Steph (Superstar)  SG: Klay (Allstar…PG is a superstar ya asshats don’t know how he’s making these lists alongside 2 other superstars)  SF: Lebron (Superstar)  PF: Draymond (Allstar)  C: Christian Wood  Bench: Tyrese Halliburton, SGA, Mikal Bridges, Jonathan Isaac, MPJ, Nerlens Noel, John Collins."
"Yeah and then there are guys like Giannis, Jonathan Isaac, etc who hit and hit massive. Westbrook was one of these guys too. You gotta swing on athleticism"

Definitely Jonathan Isaac but rookie LeBron was much better
I’d definitely trade Jonathan Isaac for Dwight Howard

"I know that Jonathan Isaac has a good reputation for defense, but I have no memory of what his game is like."
All these injured players and no mention of Jonathan Isaac. Unless he isn’t coming back soon
Jonathan Isaac
"Positions were a little skewed but a could still play the 3 since there are enough reliable 4s here. He can be a hustle guy off the bench, he'd be like Jonathan Isaac if we're talking defense and position."
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
"Jonathan Isaac, most realistically, will win it"
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
"If you mean Jonathan Isaac, I agree if you get the healthy version of him. His defensive versatility is just so rare."
Jonathan Isaac isn't even available to bet on for MIP player in the betting site I use. Spent close to a year and a half rehabbing and I think he's going to come into this season better than ever.
"I recently got a ""Defenssive highlights"" vid of Jonathan Isaac recommended on YouTube and if you see what kind of defense he played on Giannis in 18/19, he was devastating."
Like this is deadass fr. I don't get it like how. I swear i have a force them to pick someone. They're gonna change it it Jonathan Isaac award
dude we've all been saying Jonathan Isaac is going to be a thing for what feels like 3 years now. He's an exceptional defensive talent but if he can't even be on the floor what's the point. There's still hope for him but I don't expect him to be the thing we were all expecting until his late 20s at this rate. He needs some form of consistency before he can reach his potential.
Jonathan Isaac revenge tour incoming
"&gt;I took most of the following clips from a highlight video  And that's why I'm not really taking these clips at face value. If you showed someone a JR Smith highlight reel they'd think he was the greatest player the NBA has ever seen.  The video below is the second result on YouTube for 'Jonathan Isaac full play', and the only reason I didn't pick the first one is because it's from a game he only scored 13 in and I didn't think it would be a fair example. He drops 19 in this which is pretty good, but it showcases pretty much all of the limitations that I mentioned.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtxT49XJheI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtxT49XJheI)  I think people are misconstruing my posts as 'shitting on him', when that's not what I intended to do. I'm just outlining why I think expecting 20 ppg from him is unrealistic. Your point about role is a good one - it'll be interesting to see what he does with more touches. But he already took 10 fg per game in the season before his injury, so unless his usage is literally doubling (which in theory it could, but likely at the cost of efficiency) I just don't see it yet. Tag me with a RemindMe for next April if you like, and if I'm wrong then all the better for your fanbase"

"Bens one. Jonathan Isaac, kawhi, pj, OG, Sikam, Royce O’Neal. That’s just off top of my head. All of those can actually slide their feet and play defense it ain’t just effort with them."
"idk if this really counts, but i hate Jonathan Isaac in 2k, i like him in real life, but in 2k the dude makes it impossible to ever win dpoy cos he always average 3 steals and 3 blocks"
"If it were up to me…  PG-Jalen Suggs/SG-RJ Hampton/SF-Chuma Okeke/PF-Jonathan Isaac/C-Wendell Carter, Jr.  With Cole Anthony, Terrence Ross, Franz Wagner and Mo Bamba off the bench. I really don’t know where Gary Harris fits in, he’s a good veteran leader for the young guys and I don’t want to take any long term salary by trading him but I also don’t want him playing over any young guards. I think he likely gets bought out later on.   When Fultz is healthy then things get interesting."
Did you seriously try to slip Jonathan Isaac in there with those other four players?
"Jonathan Isaac isn’t a star, *yet*!"
Jonathan Isaac?
Ew wtf he looks handsome but that’s literally just not Jonathan Isaac
"That when no one is looking, Jonathan Isaac isn't biting the heads off birds.   There's just no proof."
"This sounds like it was written by Steve Clifford.       The guy started veterans James Ennis, Dwayne Bacon, Chasson Randle, and Khem Birch after the trade deadline when it was clear the Magic were trying to develop their young guys. It led to a meaningless win over the Pelicans, like many other meaningless late season Magic wins that have hurt their/your lottery odds and led to worse draft picks.      Your best prospect in years was Jonathan Isaac and didn’t even average 10 FGA/game by this third season under Clifford. MCW is atrocious lol. Gordon was so consistently underwhelming I have no idea how you could type that “he looked so good”… the Nuggets gave up a recent 24th pick in Hampton and a protected first rounder five years away, as well as the corpse of Gary Harris.       Clifford has preferred playing vets to developing young players his entire head coaching career. To suggest otherwise is true revisionist history."
"The point is that Jonathan Isaac is in fact not a center lol, he just can play as one better than Mo Bamba"
"Correct. The best case scenario for us offensively is that jalen Suggs, cole Anthony, and Jonathan isaac are our top 3 options on offense lmao."
"Jonathan Isaac is a better 5 than Mo Bamba right now, if I’m being completely honest.    So yeah definitely empty stats. Mostly from that game vs Detroit where they made the dude look like Shaq with a jumper"

"I think for Orlando it’s gonna be Jonathan Isaac, one of the best defenders in the league already and his versatility is comparably to Giannis"
Courtney Lee or Jonathan Isaac. Jesus...this has to be ranked pretty close to #365 as best birth days for NBA players goes.
Ah nice It's  Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac. He's an absolute joy to watch on the defensive end.
SGA makes an All NBA team  Knicks top 3 seed (homer take but injuries will occur and the Knicks are rlly deep)  Jonathan Isaac wins an accolade of some sort
Jonathan Isaac
"The only healthy wing defenders we have right now are Gary Harris and Franz Wagner. This was Gary Harris' first game of the season because he's been injured so I think we didn't wanna ride him too hard, and Franz was coming off playing nearly 40 minutes in the first half of the B2B so same deal.  Ideally Chuma Okeke or Jonathan Isaac would be on Jimmy but both are out atm."
"Mo Bamba might lead the league in blocks this yr, Jonathan Isaac is a DPOY player when healthy, WCJ is a really good defender, Franz Wagner at 6'10 and Chuma Okeke at 6'8 are long and tall wing defenders. Jalen Suggs is also a really good defender Magic have all the makings of being an elite defensive team."
"He has been getting 30 mpg so far since Mose became our coach. We had Vucevic in front of him and he was dealing with covid and injury issues. Never was in the right shape or conditioning. Finally has had an offseason to work on his game and body and is dominating for us. Once Jonathan Isaac comes back we will be so hard to score in the paint. Also, Clifford and Mo didn't really get along."
Jonathan Isaac for Dwight I guess. He played power forward for his first 2 seasons.
"Jonathan Isaac: ""I love China's anti-LGBTQ policies!"""
Not really. If it’s a grade 3 sprain it can be months and potential surgery. Look at the time that Jonathan Isaac and Steph curry have missed with bad ankle sprains
"Magic I’m taking a flyer on because I like their new coach and Jonathan Isaac a lot. Pistons Added an underrated Kelly olynyk to an already promising young front court and I think Cade goes a long way to sure up their ball handling/pg duties. Toranto, I think, move on from dragic relatively soon or at least give Flynn plenty of minutes to develop this year. I’m high on Scottie, but I don’t think that he solves their late game go-to guy issues."
"I have the magic as one of my “biggest jumps” teams. Regardless of his political stances, Jonathan Isaac is really good at basketball and having him back is huge for them IMO. Loved the Mosley hire. 21 wins last year in 10 fewer games w/o Isaac so I think 30 is for sure. The 7 other wins come from clutch guard play and better coaching in those “we should win this” type games."
"Spurs: Probably  Pistons: Probably  Magic: Just signed a center, have Jonathan Isaac.  Thunder: Overwhelmingly likely eying a center in one of the upcoming drafts, just drafted Giddey, signed Shai to a max. Maxing Shai and Ayton would put them in a very awkward rebuild/compete position suddenly which doesn't really make sense with all the long-term moves they've made.   Hornets: Just drafted a center, already have a lot of money to worry about. Hayward, Rozier, going to have to pay Bridges, Lamelo in a couple years.   Knicks: Probably not. Paid but didn't max Randle, going to have to pay Barrett soon, maxing Ayton would pretty much lock them into a Barrett/Randle/Ayton core, which is pretty bad, especially given the draw of the Knicks.   Rockets: Just drafted Sengun and Garuba, who are both bigs that can't shoot. Traded up for Sengun and you can probably never play him and Ayton together. They also already have Christian Wood.   Kings: Just signed Richaun Holmes, paying De'Aaron Fox, you sign Ayton and then try to trade Holmes for? Fox and Ayton also aren't a great fit because Fox can't shoot.   Wizards: Probably  Blazers: Don't have nearly the cap space and not even going to attempt to clear the cap space for Ayton.   Mavericks: Don't think they have the cap space, and, assuming they haven't completely changed how they want to build their team, they want Luka on the floor with 4 shooters as much as possible. Don't see them spending a max slot on a non-shooter.   Celtics: Literally just paid Robert Williams a very team-friendly contract and not worth fucking our cap for Ayton."
Living on a Prayer for Jonathan Isaac.
Get Jonathan Isaac in there
Jonathan Isaac DPOY.

"Zach Collins and his twin, Jonathan Isaac."
[spotrac has it as fully guaranteed ](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/orlando-magic/jonathan-isaac-23601/)
"I never understood how OG only got 72 but Jonathan Isaac, who had torn his all like 2 months before, got 69 million fully guaranteed.   IMO OG is like clearly better than Isaac. And I like Isaac a lot but I’d rather have the very good defensive forward that’s a solid offensive player than the elite defender who might eventually play offense, who also can never stay healthy. The fact that their contracts were even close is crazy"
"Because it's not actually about any moral outrage or actual concern for humanity.  It's about clicks, likes, retweets, and upvotes.   The same reason why Jonathan ""Fox News"" Isaac is getting zero flak."
"Lol, Jonathan Isaac and Trey Burke both left it at personal choice and that didn't stop anyone from caring. Only reason Kyrie is getting more attention is because he's a star and a lot of people already didn't like him."
"&gt; legal vaccine mandates like these are a sack of eels; the cases for and against them are a lot more tangled than our current state of polarization would imply.  It's absurd. Pretty sure I didn't hear Kyrie, Jonathan Isaac, or any of these other hypocrites taking a stand against smallpox or polio vaccines. Science is all good when it's developing career-saving surgeries, peak nutritional plans, and exercise regiments, but a vaccine that has been administered to tens of millions of Americans with a very small chance of a side effect, all while hundreds of thousands of Americans have died, is too much? The selfishness and stupidity displayed by some people who should know better and who have access to the best medical minds in the country remains absolutely shocking."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
"If people weren't writing about Kyrie and you weren't posting their shit no one would know about it because he isn't saying anything.  Unlike Jonathan ""Fox News"" Isaac, who should actually be rebuked, but that wouldn't get nearly as much burn."
"Wiggins is a great example of who vaccine mandates are meant to target.   He didn’t want the vaccine because Covid hadn’t affected him personally.  The vaccine mandates did affect him personally so he got the shot to make them go away so he could keep living his life. There are a *lot* of people, especially in Wiggins age range, who share that kind of thinking.  Not being able to go to the gym or a restaurant shouldn’t be the determinative factor but for many people it is.   Compare with someone like Jonathan Isaac or Kyrie who are militantly anti-vaxx and no amount of societal or financial pressure will get through to them."
Kyrie is not an example of that effect. He doesn't claim any special knowledge. Jonathan Isaac might be. Kyrie is just a run of the mill conspiracy theorist who happens to be great at basketball.
What about that news about Jonathan Isaac and those kids from his bible study?
Jonathan Isaac
I have respect for guys like Jonathan Isaac who explain their stance on it professionally and have clearly done their research. Kyrie is not one of those people
"Yes, his reason for his “protest” isn’t the reason he is saying publicly. Same thing with our local religious zelot and “free thinker” Jonathan Isaac. The reason why he is contradictory in his statements and he talks in broad strokes that don’t make a ton of sense (saying he doesn’t want to take it for religious freedom for instance) is because the reasons he is giving aren’t his real reasons for not taking the vaccine. JI’s real reasoning is probably so nutty to mainstream America that he isn’t saying it out loud."
"A healthy Kyrie, Michael Porter Jr, and Jonathan Isaac would actually be a great core."
&gt;Imagine thinking Jonathan Isaac for example doesn't flat out agree with Fox News on most issues  Maybe I missed something. How do we know he agrees with Fox News on most issues?
Him and Jonathan Isaac will get along just fine
"Lol why does this title act like the players are helpless victims or something  Imagine thinking Jonathan Isaac for example doesn't flat out agree with Fox News on most issues, not just on one talking point"
I believe he’s referring to Jonathan Isaac who has stated some extremely right wing views including supporting Trump.
"Right ? Jonathan Isaac might be wrong in my eyes, but at least he’s standing on his word. He said this is what I feel and why I won’t get vaccinated, Kyrie is just hiding in the shadows not saying a word while the news reports and random reports get to speak for him.    I’m 90% sure he won’t say anything and his first comment will be about how the media is toxic and he never “said” anything anti-vax but they put the words in his mouth and never got a chance to speak for himself."
I’m glad the Nets went full send. Wonder if players like Jonathan Isaac are sweating right now lol
Jonathan Isaac snubbed big time. No respect for his standout showing of ignorance on Fox News
"Who besides Kyrie has proclaimed to be ""woke"" before the vaccine?  You're gloating like Jonathan Isaac, one of the few vocal anti-vaxxers in the league, wasn't refusing to kneel or like Andrew Wiggins has been a vocal proponent for social causes.  Don't bother to answer, you showed your true colors calling the concept that black people shouldn't be killed by cops crap and nonsense.  Your opinion, much like your character, is literal garbage."
"Jonathan Isaac, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, ... yeah you get the idea"
It was a really bad joke but I appreciate how hard he’s worked to make up for it and more. Plus he was able to serve as an example to take it serious and in terms of covid faux pas around the league jonathan isaac saying god told him he didn’t need to get vaccinated or whatever the fuck kyrie is doing is way worse
"Fultz, Suggs, Okeke, Jonathan Isaac, Mo Bamba"
Oh my Lord Kyrie Irving and Jonathan Isaac are fucking idiots
\- Fox News to Jonathan Isaac
"&gt; Kyrie joining Jonathan Isaac as a future Fox News contributor.   Nah, Fox News as an employer is very pro-vax.   [Fox News’ Anti-Vax Mandate Messaging Is Out of Step With Its Own Strict Policies](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/fox-news-anti-vax-messaging-policies)  &gt; 90% of Fox’s full-time employees were vaccinated as of last month, with daily testing for those who are not.  Just because Fox News sells anti-vax bullshit doesn't mean they swallow it themselves.   It's like when someone asked an RJ Reynolds executive why he didn't smoke cigarettes, and he said: ""We don’t smoke that shit! We just sell it."""
We're two steps away from Kyrie joining Jonathan Isaac as a future Fox News contributor.  It's actually impressive how many antivaxxers he's dragging out as fans.
"kyrie has said nothing about the vaccine to the media, unlike bradley beal and jonathan isaac"
"Wanted to point out, I don’t think Devin Vassell and Kabengele were highly recruited coming out of high school. Further proving your point that FSU basketball lately has been developing ALL of their players, not just the super star Jonathan Isaac/Scottie Barnes type players. Leonard Hamilton has been doing a great job getting the absolute most out of that program. During my time at FSU, the basketball team was much more fun to watch than the football team, which had likely never been the case previously."
"What other colleges can stack up with FSU right now in the NBA? I know there are a few, but for being a football school it’s shocking that FSU has to be in the top-5ish?  PG - Scottie Barnes SG - Malik Beasley SF - Terrence Mann PF - Patrick Williams C - Jonathan Isaac  Devin Vassell off the bench"
Jonathan Isaac sparked a real conversation about vaccines and public health and all this sub can upvote is something saying he is spreading anti vax nonsense? This sub is more pathetic than Fox News will ever be.
"Youre kidding yourself if you think Jonathan Isaac is just gonna stop at commenting a bit on covid vaccines. Hes an ordained minister, and clearly has aspirations beyond this (and the aptitude to do it)"
&gt;  Jonathan Isaac is a smart guy who knows exactly what he's doing  Only someone as idiotic could think that
Jonathan Isaac is going to have a nice second career repeating conservative talking points like Candace Owens or Jason Witlock.

How about Jonathan Isaac and get some floor spacing and rim protection?
I know I know *antivax bad* etc … but if Kyrie does this I will put some respect on his name. These people like Jonathan Isaac are saying this is an issue of liberty and autonomy and stuff. If that’s their principle and they really believe in it - let’s see you sacrifice the money!

What does this have to do with Jonathan Isaac the fuck are you talking about
"Jonathan Isaac held a sermon at his church and NONE of his teammates showed up. Now, ask yourself: why would zero of your teammates show up? You gotta assume there’s at least one other dude on the team who’s a Christian, so why wouldn’t they go? Is it because the entire squad is atheist or is because the dude is unlikable to the point that his teammates can’t support him?"
Don’t trust Dr. Fauci. We should all be listening to *checks notes* Jonathan Isaac
"Jonathan Isaac always presented himself to be a pretty intelligent guy but unfortunately he’s let us all down because he’s actually an idiot. What’s rational about not getting vaccinated against an illness with 700,000 bodies in the US alone? Now he’s on Fox News spouting this nonsense. Down bad"

"Ill Start off, Jonathan Isaac"
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
&gt;The problem I have with this is that these same players would be offended by the general public (or other players) being passive about issues they care about. I’m just thinking about the reaction if another prominent player was asked about BLM and they just said “My views on that are private and personal.”  That’s a wild assumption. Jonathan Isaac is anti-BLM and there was zero backlash against him.
"Wiggins isn't Kyrie or Jonathan Isaac. Wiggins didn't want to discuss it, didn't try to tell people the vaccines don't work or tell them not to take it, he personally didn't want to take it.   If he played in Houston it wouldn't have been leaked and he wouldn't have been one of the faces of unvaccinated NBA players, he would have just gotten tested every few days and play."
Jonathan Isaac
Jonathan Isaac is definitely the religious guy lol
"Jonathan Isaac the Human 1,000 Piece puzzle confirmed."
Jonathan Isaac would've shattered into a million pieces if he got the same injury that Gianni's got in the finals.
And Jonathan Isaac without crutches
I'm with you except his phrasing makes him seem like he doesn't believe in ANY established medicine or science.   I'd much rather someone make a statement like Jonathan Isaac where they say they understand that it's real and vaccines help but aren't getting it than someone pretending to know more than everyone else.
Jonathan Isaac
&gt; The more I hear these dumbasses come out with their asinine thoughts the more I am losing actual interest in the nba. Its breaking the illusion that these guys are actually people we should even entertain in their thoughts concerning important matters. How the fuck can lebron be coming out with this wishy washy bullshit when he is a role model for literally millions?  &gt; I think what would allow me to just be ok with this is just watch the nba and imagine all of the players as meatheads who are good at basketball and thats it. Too many of them are fucking stupid.  &gt; Except Gordon Hayward and Jonathan Isaac and anyone who had a spine concerning the riots. I like those two  LMAO  r/nba has become what it claims to hate
I've already seen random antivaxxers buy Jonathan Isaac jerseys lol. The DeVos' are probably thrilled
"Yeah, no, I'm not going to ""educate myself"" by researching every stupid comment by some r/conspiracy idiot on reddit. Jonathan Isaac is a fundamentalist and actively harming the fight against the pandemic."
"It's not about winning a debate, it's about educating yourself.  Maybe if everyone had that perspective, we wouldn't all be shitting on Jonathan Isaac."
He was saying that Jonathan Isaac actually said something as opposed to all the other antivax players saying a whole lot of nothing.
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"&gt; 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down &gt; 2018 - Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down  Ouch, these 2 are ROUGH lol. I had no idea."
"Yeah I was gonna say this sounds like exactly what happened (or is happening) to Jonathan Isaac especially since he's uber-religious.  Also because it's the Magic, I didn't realize they actually drafted someone by the name Jalen Suggs."
"In **South East** I'd change Suggs and Hayward for LaMelo and Isaac to have:  Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Bam Adebayo.   In **South West** I'd change Thad Young for Dejounte Murray straight up.  In terms of rankings, I'd go:  1. **Pacific** \- LeBron, Steph and Kawhi is just too much. Especially with a rim-running big man and a lights-out shooter.  2. **North West** \- When the worst player in your lineup is Shai and you have elite shooting throughout, that's scary. 3. **Atlantic** \- my one concern here is that unless FVV develops it, there isn't really an elite playmaker in this lineup.  4. **South East** \- Massive firepower in Trae, LaMelo and Beal, and then you bank on there being enough defense from Isaac and Bam to cover it. Isaac and Beal won't be taking a shot.  5. **Central** \- Lots of talent in the lineup but the lack of versaility made me put them so low. Their 3-5 can't really shoot from the perimeter. 6. **South West** \- Honestly, just the last talent?"
it's not; the article i believe was meant to always be suggs  jonathan isaac isn't important enough to get a takedown of that level; we've hit like cole beasley but if you want clicks the audience needs to have an idea slightly beyond the niche  source: i mean just read what i typed up there and guess
"Suggs is the first blue-chip prospect we've had since Dwight left.  Besides our two playoff years, we didn't just miss out of the playoffs either, we were straight bad (bottom 5 every year except 2016 (11th, still bad) and the playoff appearances) and then unlucky with draft slots and terrible trades by the previous FO. If you look at our drafts since Dwight, we've always moved down or stayed put and just out of reach of franchise talent.  https://i.redd.it/ncc5bvz3rx671.jpg  * 2013 - Oladipo (good pick but bad trade by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job)  * 2014 - AG - we miss out on Embiid by one pick because we move down in the draft.  * 2015 - Mario - we miss out on Porzingis by one pick * 2016 - Pick becomes Sabonis, but traded by previous GM desperate to make moves to keep his job * 2017 - Jonathan Isaac - good pick, but we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Fox) by one slot, again because we move down * 2018 -  Bamba - we miss out on the PG we desperately need (Trae) by one slot, again because we move down * 2019 - Chuma - Great pick * 2020 - Cole - Good pick * 2021 - We should have ended up with Scottie, again missing out on the point guard we desperately need by one pick, because we moved down...again. Toronto passing on Suggs was the first break we've caught in a long long time.  IMO it's silly to try and say retrospectively they should have drafted a Devin Booker (13th pick) or an MPJ (14th pick) or SGA (11th pick) with a 5th pick. We've simply been unlucky and haven't had any franchise talent simply fall into our laps like some of these other teams. The trades made by the previous FO deserve the criticism and Hennigan should have been canned much earlier, but it is what it is."
"Dr. Jonathan Isaac, r/nba."
The original picture was Jonathan Isaac. Makes even more sense but they got pushback from the antivaxxers https://twitter.com/josheberley/status/1443291395553255424?s=21
"you can find a correlation looking at local vaccination rates, COVID case counts, ER &amp; ICU capacity etc. and pretty easily figure out that there are areas of the country where people are steadfast in refusing the vaccine.  If seeing 3/4 of a million people die in the US isn't convincing enough to change behavior for the greater good &amp; get a vaccine, I don't think it's a stretch to count a bunch of these bozos in the ""never going to get it"" category.  There's always a new reason or excuse why people haven't or shouldn't yet, and it's always bullshit, so excuse me for feeling like stone cold idiots like MPJ, Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac or the Q-Anoners that drink horse medicine to own the libs don't deserve an ounce of my patience or compassion.  If you don't like that, feel free to downvote me and scroll the fuck on."
"You are ignoring that if you are vaccinated there is nothing Jonathan Isaac is doing that is going to harm or kill you. Am I wrong?  I really don't know how to better ask the question why are you worried about what other people are doing when everybody has complete access to taking a vaccine that will completely exempt them from any serious danger with COVID. If you don't take it and you get sick, you're a moron and we agree on that. But not everyone not taking the vaccine is at risk like that or has had it in the past and won't be spreading anything for at least several months."
What about Jonathan Isaac?   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gteFcUlxjyY&amp;t=385s
"&gt;Hell, you out here thinking Jonathan Isaac is right  And this is where I dip. Can’t discuss with people who try to make your own views up for you"
"&gt; Pretty sure he's going to be r/conservative's token NBA hero  ugh, just wait till Jonathan Isaac comes back from injury."
"VERY similar to ""NBA Star"" Jonathan Isaac in that the title is a big stretch coming from these right-wing sources.  ""NBA Player"" more like."

"I have been watching a few games lately. Here's what I want to see, because I'd like to win a few.  PG: Cole Anthony  SG: Markelle Fultz  SF: Franz Wagner  PF: Jonathan Isaac  C: Wendell Carter, Jr. _____ 2nd unit: Suggs, Hampton, T. Ross, Okeke, Bamba"
I don’t watch much pat will but can he rim protect/rebound? I feel like a guy who can help play the 5 on defense with him and rebound would be a good fit like what Jonathan isaac did for him
Jonathan Isaac  Cole Anthony   Franz Wagner  Wendell Carter Jr  Jalen Suggs  Markelle Fultz  Mo Bamba  Chuma Okeke
Jonathan Isaac
"Pretty much every recent high lotto 7 footer other than ayton has had significant injury issues in their careers so far. Wiseman, bagley, JJJ, Jonathan Isaac, mo Bamba, wendell Carter jr. Ayton was also built like a Greek god coming in."
"Twolves, Pacers, Bulls, Nuggets and Magic all have 5s who shoot.   Trades could be:  Twolves - Beasley + Russell + Pick   Pacers - Brogdon when he’s allowed to be traded  Bulls - idk I wish Zach Lavine was worse so it could happen   Nuggets - probably no deal here unless they wanna sell low on MPJ and the Sixers want 2 guys with injury problems   Magic - Jonathan Isaac and cole Anthony? Idk"
Source? Think you have him confused with Jonathan Isaac
"Bradley Beal, Jonathan Isaac, and MPJ : “He’s correct”"
"not that far back, more like 2/3 years  ago when they had Vucevic/Mo Bamba/Jonathan Isaac/Aaron Gordon all playing significant minutes"
"&gt;Him, Cole Anthony, Wendell Carter Jr, and Jonathan Isaac look like legitimate building blocks for a perennial playoff team.  FTFY."
"Him, Cole Anthony, Mo Bamba, and Jonathan Isaac look like legitimate building blocks for a perennial playoff team. No wonder yall didn't mind losing Vucevic and Gordon."
Kyrie  Bradley Beal  Jonathan Isaac
"Jonathan Isaac if he can somehow stay healthy, Thybulle if he is able to generate a somewhat decent offensive game to get enough minutes."
Jonathan Isaac? Poku?
Jonathan Isaac: god told me to speak at this republican convention
ever notice how every right wing athlete is suddenly a 'star'? the FUCK has jonathan goddamn isaac done to make himself a star?
"Could someone explain to me how they think Jonathan Isaac is the best player on this team?  He's never been good,. Yes he's a good athlete for a guy his size and he puts forth excellent defensive effort but that's pretty much all he offers. He can't shoot, he can't really pass, he can't really dribble, so what else is there?  Add to that several major injuries which may well hamper the athleticism that's his only positive attribute."
"Holy shit. The other keynote speakers at this event are Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, JD Vance, Peter Thiel, etc. not only are these like incredibly right-wing, proto-fascist politicians, but they’re some people in some seriously high positions in the US government. . .   Jonathan Isaac is flirting with some seriously dangerous ideologies here, I wouldn’t want him anywhere near my franchise despite him filling all of our needs on the basketball court."
TIL Jonathan Isaac is an NBA star. Which team does he play for?
"I remember back in like his rookie or sophomore year, Jonathan Isaac said he invited everyone on his team to come to his church since he was speaking and none of them came"
smh couldn't even get Kyrie had to settle for Jonathan Isaac
Noone underrates Jonathan Isaac like Celt fans
You're missing possibly their best young player: Jonathan Isaac
"Jonathan Isaac, Cole Anthony, Jalen Suggs, Chuma Okeke, Wendell Carter Jr"
"&gt;unless injuries hit.  How can you just gloss over injuries. One injury can take away a players athleticism and halt their progress. Gary Harris for example was a great defender, then he got hit with injuries and is a borderline rotation player. Look at Jonathan Isaac. Anything can happen, guaranteeing a rookie will eventually win DPOY after a few games is ridiculous. There are plenty of elite defenders who don't even make all-defense every year"
Markelle Fultz   Cole Anthony   RJ Hampton  Jalen Suggs  Franz Wagner  Chuma Okeke  Jonathan Isaac  Wendell Carter Jr   Mo Bamba  is a solid core plus a top 5 pick hopefully added
"As an FSU fan I can tell you he was better for us than his stats lead you to believe. Under Leonard Hamilton’s system, you can’t judge a player by their PPG. A top prospect playing at FSU will always have less eye-popping stats than players of a similar caliber at other schools because Leonard likes a rotation of 11+ guys vs 7 at other schools. He also doesn’t believe in “feeding the hot hand” and, sometimes to fan chagrin, is not above subbing the team’s best player out if he believes it’s for the good of the team. You can take a look at Jonathan Isaac and Patrick Williams’ stats as further examples of this phenomenon. I truly believe that Leonard and his staff are great at scouting and developing talent (see Trent Forrest, Terrance Mann, and Kabengele) but these recruits will never be given as much of a spotlight as they would receive at schools with shallower benches.  Scottie was the floor general for us last year as a freshman and did a pretty good job of it."
&gt;did you want to hear that because there it is  I don’t care.  I’d bet my life savings that dudes like jonathan Isaac came to their conclusion from more than a YouTube guy with no credentials yes
"MPJ over God and His creation, what you gonna do, Jonathan Isaac?"
"Full quote:  I stand with Kyrie Irving.   I stand with Andrew Wiggins.  I stand with Bradley Beal.  I stand with Jonathan Isaac.  #NBA  #YourBodyYourChoice  2/x I’ve never said this before: I agree with @KingJames   “We’re talking about people’s bodies and well-being. I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people should do for their bodies and livelihoods.”  3/x @KingJames is being courageous here.  With his box-office power, he could be even more courageous—he could SOLVE the problem—by saying:  “I stand w/ my fellow players. And I won’t play in any arena that bans another NBA player because they make a personal healthcare choice."""
I don't think Cruz could even tell you what team Jonathan Isaac is on
Jonathan Isaac
"Uh, doesn’t this only apply to SF and NY teams? AFAIK, Florida doesn’t have this mandate in place and Jonathan Isaac for example won’t be barred from playing in Orlando."
"There's always going to be a few with controversial, ""crazy"" opinions.  But it's only a few.  This isn't the amount of NBA players that did BLM protesting. **It's closer to the amount that opposed it.** Jonathan Isaac is double dipping, even. Wonder what Meyers Leonard thinks about the vaccine."
Idk Jonathan Isaac seemed pretty articulate to me when I listened to him explain why he hasn’t gotten vaccinated.
Nothing Jonathan Isaac said was wrong.
How does Jonathan Isaac not getting vaccinated mean he doesn't give fuck about anyone else?
"I’m vaccinated and don’t think anything Isaac says here is smart.  But “advocating for people to get vaccinated” is such an incredible waste of time, no one this late in the game is waiting for online comments to sway them.   He brought up the fact that there is still research being done into natural immunity, and we don’t know as much about covid as everyone pretends we do.   Again, I am not agreeing with Jonathan Isaac, I just think it’s hilarious some of you think you’re “helping” by stating the obvious and calling people morons, as if that helps anything."
"&gt;	If u can’t understand what Jonathan Isaac said, then idk man 🤷🏽‍♂️    Foh with that, nephew. Are you in the medical field? That's assumptions, not science. Find me a source that says you don't need the vaccine if you have antibodies. I'll wait."
"1) he has gotten the virus before, thus have anti-bodies, it is not completely clear whether the vaccine or anti-bodies is better. Research is still happening   2) he is probably in the top 1% of the top 1% amongst fittest individuals in the planet. We know that being unfit (obese) makes you more vulnerable from Covid   Personally I have the vaccine and will probably get booster shots when docs tell us to do but if u can’t understand what Jonathan Isaac said, then idk man 🤷🏽‍♂️  Making fun or harassing people won’t make them change their stance. You’re only gonna alienate them even further."
"Lololololol “death culting.” Get a grip of yourself. It’s more like, people calling for distinctions of hospitalizations *with* vs. *of* COVID were right all along, but somehow that’s irrelevant to you now.   Also you’re arguing an entirely different point than I am. Obviously the vaccines do a great job of preventing serious illness, I never disputed that. The point was, young, healthy, professional basketball players are at virtually no risk of getting a serious case of COVID *with or without* the vaccine. Add on to that fact that Jonathan Isaac has tested positive in the past and thus has antibodies, it’s even more ridiculous to vilify him for not wanting the vaccine.   Not only are you inconsistent in whatever point it is you’re trying to argue, you’re finding authors who *disagree with you at their core* as to the severity of the pandemic. And instead of recognizing the overarching thrust of the piece, you pull out the name-calling that people of your ilk have so readily depended upon the last 18 months instead of sound argumentation and data driven policy making.   Good day to you, sir. Make sure you stay home, though - wouldn’t want to kill any grandmas!"
"They're young and fit so not scared of covid. They can wear masks, wash their hands and socially distance. Players can be tested before every game.   Jonathan Isaac says it better [here](https://youtu.be/gteFcUlxjyY)"
[Jonathan Isaac gives some good answers here](https://youtu.be/gteFcUlxjyY)
"I guess NBA would like to segregate the people like Jonathan isaac.  How dare he think and speak for himself.  He should know his place, amirite?"
"Every single explanation I’ve ever heard about why someone doesn’t want to get the vaccine is centered squarely on themselves. They don’t care about anyone else or the fact that this virus has literally crippled large facets of society. Unvaccinated people aren’t ridiculed simply because they don’t want the vaccine, they’re ridiculed because they are doing nothing to help prevent the spread.  I don’t give a rats ass about whether people like Jonathan Issac are sufficiently protected from COVID. I care about whether **other** people are sufficiently protected from people like Jonathan Isaac."
"""Popular Science? More like Nerdular Nerdence"" - Jonathan Isaac"
"Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Andrew Wiggins, Michael Porter Jr,  Jonathan Isaac with Josh Richardson as the 6th man."
I feel like it would only be fair if this league eschewed all kinds of medical treatments. Let's see how far prayer will get Jonathan Isaac then.
"Pretty sure he means the detonation device but this would be hilarious.   &gt;Robin Lopez: *opens locker. “Why the fu—“  &gt;Jon Isaac: “I say young ker. I challenge thee.”  And the best part is, Robin Lopez would fight him and then halfway through realize that Jonathan Isaac isn’t the mascot. He just spends that much time on the sideline."
~~BRADLEY BEAL~~  JONATHAN ISAAC IN SHAMBLES  ^(forgot he wasn't on the Wizards anymore for a second lmao)
"yeah, well maybe not jonathan isaac"
how about my knowledgable local priest Jonathan Isaac?
Anti-vaxxers and vaccinated split cleanly along political lines. The movement’s been there for years but Covid denial specifically was spurred by Trump.   Jonathan Isaac stated he became distrustful of doctors after listening to Trump.
"Anti Vax all star team looking wild, Kyrie, Wiggins, Beal, Jonathan Isaac, Josh Richardson."
"Jonathan Isaac is an embarrassment.  Man got drafted 6th in the draft and can’t stay on the court and when he does, can’t play offense."
Jonathan Isaac
"The list is 100% going to grow. Winter hasn’t hit yet.   Honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see a few notably insistent anti-vaxxers end up retiring over this. Mainly looking at Jonathan Isaac, I’m suspicious that Kyrie loves his spotlight a little too much and will eventually cave it KD is in his ear about it."
Jonathan Isaac man I liked his build. Literally that’s what I liked about him
"I’d like to thank Kyrie, Jonathan Isaac, and Wiggins for taking off the media’s sights off the clownery that is the Sixers for a bit. Feels good mann"

"Seriously, was Jonathan Isaac rejecting all those ACL treatments that players usually get? Was he ignoring medical experts then? Why does he suddenly think he knows more than his doctors now? It’s not just lack of access to information, he can absolutely talk one-on-one with a dozen different doctors at anytime he wants"
This is actually the day Jonathan Isaac turned atheist.
&gt;Off the court: Jonathan Isaac  What did he do?
Jonathan Isaac has negative IQ
On the court: Michael Carter Williams  Off the court: Jonathan Isaac
Damn seeing the Jonathan Isaac slander blows because he’s a great kid
"Lol the ""shit on Jonathan Isaac"" karma farm begins. Crazy how every time the sub decides to shit on someone there are multiple highlights showing them getting posterized or losing a close game, lol."
Jonathan Isaac to Judah
Fuck Jonathan Isaac  All my homies hate Jonathan Isaac
[he cited religious reasons for that as well](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.actionnewsjax.com/news/trending/jonathan-isaac-stands-alone-during-nba-national-anthem-cites-religious-reasons/N446NCIBEBHCNFD5PSKK473UTA/%3foutputType=amp)
Jonathan Isaac
"Or he could go deep into the benches of historical conservatism and go with Jonathan Isaac D’Israeli, a nod to a literal and metaphorical father of conservatism and a strong supporter of Israel, just like Jonathan Isaac."
Jonathan Isaac DeVos.
"Magic fans in the know have known this about Isaac for a while. It’s like having an old racist Grandfather. When you hear, “hey we talked to Jonathan Isaac today” you cringe like “oh god, what did he say?”"
I don’t know who Jonathan Isaac is but he can go fuck himself.
"As a diehard Magic fan who hasn’t missed more that 5 games a year for the past (mostly) horrible decade, please trade Jonathan Isaac. Or just cut him.  It’s hard enough for the diehards, what’s left of us anyway, to support the on court product.  Adding Isaac embarrassing us nationally every year or so to the Magic fan’s plate is almost too much to take.  He barely plays so he does more damage to us on the sidelines while adding nothing on the court when hurt (always btw). This is the tip of the iceberg also Magic brass.  If he gets more famous and gets a bigger following he is just going to say worse things.  I remember when we first drafted him he said some pretty nutty shit on Twitter but he had like 5 followers so no one cared.   It’s hard enough to get fair weather fans to embrace our youth movement, it’s even harder to get out of market fans to care at all about Orlando, we don’t need to give people even more reason to say “Orlando sucks” as a reflexive statement if we are ever mentioned.    Now, we suck on top of being the crazy and stupid team."
"The worst part is that Jonathan Isaac is probably already vaccinated for Hep B, MMR, Diphtheria Polio and chicken pox as a schoolchild in New York. So he thinks God was like ""vaccines are fine, except this one in particular""?"
Jesus would be disappointed in Jonathan Isaac.
*Jonathan Isaac has liked this post*
"It seems you are completely missing the point on how religion was used to justify the demonization of multiple cultures, and forcefully strip many of their original understands.  Looks like you decided to focus on the diversity of American's religions instead....as if I suggested all Americans were christians and not that Christianity was used to forcefully push others into American ideals.   I have justification in hating both. My ancestors even more so. If you fully understand the reason why that is or not, is entirely up to you. I don't hate religion, never said I did and I'm frankly confused on where you're getting that idea from.  I said I hate Christianity.   Even then, I still hold nothing against those who follow it. But the way Christianity was used in America is demonic and hypocritical.   Many of those who are deeply religious christians today continue to play into those hateful, idiotic, or extremely conservative views.   Jonathan Isaac being one of them."
yea cutting Jonathan Isaac would really help out the magic
Wolves:  Penny Hardaway  Dwayne Wade  Wes Mathews  Jonathan Isaac  Vlade Divac   This would be fun
Jonathan Isaac should spend less time tweeting and more time playing Basketball.
"In a league that is vaccinated at a higher rate than any country in the world (90+%) and with strict protocols in place, it is absurd to characterize the extremely small group of anti-vaxxer voices as somehow constituting a NBA ""civil war."" This is either click-bait journalism or just a poorly framed article. Kyrie and Jonathan Isaac are notable for being outsiders, not leaders of an equal movement."
"Jonathan Isaac is an asshole, who hides his jerk nature behind his religion.  Also journalists seemed to get it spot on, don’t know why he thinks he’s getting misrepresented"
Jonathan Isaac is an idiot.
Jonathan Isaac attended 3 high schools over 4 years ending up at sports powerhouse IMG academy. He then attended 1 year at FSU. This guy is a fucking dumbass and if he wasn’t 6 foot 11 would just be a regular religious nut job
"Okay whatever Jonathan. Fuck you and fuck this guy. He's such an idiot.   Fuck Wiggins, fuck Isaac and Fuck Irving"
So Jonathan Isaac is an idiot TIL
Jonathan Isaac cited watching Trump press conferences before he ended up distrusting Dr Anthony Fauci… in case you didn’t know.
Fuck Jonathan isaac
I don't think Jonathan Isaac could get an abortion even if he wanted to
Have you even seen who Jonathan Isaac follows on Twitter?
"Kareem and Enes are on the money, the vaccine is about ensuring that everybody around you is safe. It is their choice to not get the vaccine and every choice has consequence. Jonathan Isaac can talk about how he feels that it is discrimination but that is something of his own doing. Nothing is completely 100% perfect. Not the vaccine nor a kidney replacement"
"[According to Rolling Stone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/nba-anti-vaccine-theory-issues-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-kyrie-irving-jonathan-isaac-025316932.html), Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving — who has a past filled with conspiracy theories — has reportedly been liking social media posts regarding “secret societies” that are “implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for ‘a plan of Satan.’"
"“he learned about antibody resistance”   i’m just picturing a montage of jonathan isaac in a lab coat bent over peering through a microscope, meticulously taking notes and conducting tireless research.   while in reality all this means is he read an article and watched a video on youtube lmfao. people are ignorant as fuck"
Jonathan Isaac is an idiot.
Jonathan Isaac been trash
"&gt; Jesus Christ, not Jonathan Isaac too  Isaac follows like every idiot right wing pundit on Twitter lol, how is this unexpected"
"Did you not read the article this headline comes from? The guy was at a reservation school, not wearing a mask properly, around other unvaccinated kids, in one of the most vulnerable populations in the US. He’s irresponsible and either isn’t aware of his social media impact or he just doesn’t give a fuck. Even if he never came to Boston I would think the same of him. After reading about Jonathan Isaac in this article, I think he’s a headcase too."
"&gt; “There are so many other players outside of him who are opting out, I would like to think they would make a way,” says Kyrie’s aunt, Tyki Irving, who runs the seven-time All-Star’s family foundation and is one of the few people in his regular circle of advisors. “It could be like every third game. So it still gives you a full season of being interactive and being on the court, but with the limitations that they’re, of course, oppressing upon you. There can be some sort of formula where the NBA and the players can come to some sort of agreement.”  So Kyrie is not vaccinated. Not sure how one can declare themselves an advocate for the black community then not take steps to prevent a disease that disproportionately affects Black Americans. Remember when he told the Nets he was having family issues then went partying without a mask at an indoor venue for his sister's birthday? If you scroll down the article, she says even more. Please stop falling for his antics and BS.  &gt; Jonathan Isaac is known less by the average basketball fan for his play than for being that guy who stood up with his jersey on during the national anthem in the NBA bubble, while every other player on the court took a knee in a t-shirt declaring BLACK LIVES MATTER, amid a global reckoning on race and police killings. “I’m not going to sit here and point my fingers at one group of people,” Isaac, who is Black, tells RS. “I would do it again.”  &gt; The Orlando Magic’s 23-year-old starting forward is deeply religious — and proudly unvaccinated. When NBA players started lining up for shots in March, Isaac started studying Black history and watching Donald Trump’s press conferences. He learned about antibody resistance and came to distrust Dr. Anthony Fauci. He looked out for people who might die from the vaccine, and he put faith in God.  Mo Bamba, his teammate, could have easily had his career derailed by post-COVID illness and be stuck on the edge of the league if not for the Magic's tanking status. How selfish. Jonathan must have skimmed the Gospel."
"&gt; Jesus Christ, not Jonathan Isaac too  he's like the most obvious anti-vaxxer except for Kyrie lol, dude is omega religious"
"Jesus Christ, not Jonathan Isaac too. I love that guy, or at least I did.      And wtf Kyrie:      &gt; Irving, who serves as a vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union, recently started following and liking Instagram posts from a conspiracy theorist who claims that “secret societies” are implanting vaccines in a plot to connect Black people to a master computer for “a plan of Satan.”"

I mean those are just exaggerated. Jonathan Isaac got a season to recover from rust. Bagley is getting several seasons to show his goods. MPJ. Etc. etc.
