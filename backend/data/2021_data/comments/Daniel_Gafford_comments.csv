An epic battle between Big Tony and Daniel gafford
"All this tells me is that Thaddeus Young, Daniel Gafford, and Lauri Markannen aren‚Äôt good defenders."
4 fouls for Daniel gafford lol in 5 minutes
"I know who Daniel Gafford is, he is athletic and goes hard"
"Daniel gafford, he was a second round pick a couple drafts ago"
My favorite it Mr. Mean for Daniel gafford
Getting weirdly excited by Daniel Gafford.
Daniel Gafford is starting to look legit under Donovan
"Nah man its gotta be Cody Rhodes, Dwight Howard, Caleb Swannigan, Daniel Gafford, Mother F*cker, and Nevada"
"I never seen a player get babied as much as Yuta is in this sub. He got fucking yammed on, and people in this sub are like ‚Äúwe should celebrate Yuta more than the dunk because effort‚Äù   It‚Äôs fried cause Daniel Gafford for posterized by Zion last night, but I don‚Äôt see 100 posts about how we should respect Gaffords effort.  Seriously soft as hell, he got dunked on, nothing to celebrate there  Edit: literally just saw a comment saying that the person who gets dunked on should be celebrated more than the dunker because ‚Äúanyone can dunk‚Äù   Yeah anyone can get dunked on either"
Lol someone is salty about Daniel Gafford beating them tonight
Gobert is literally Daniel Gafford if Gafford got away with fouls due to his reputation
"Daniel Gafford: October 1, 1998 - March 3, 2021"
Yea the Bulls could have drafted SGA but have you seen how good Daniel Gafford is playing? We probably don‚Äôt need SGA.
"1. Get a PG - Coby White is not a point guard, and we need someone who can playmake and create open looks for all of our shooters and help get rid of our turnover problem.  2. Get better bigs - Every time we play a team with a competent center, they destroy us inside the paint and on second chance points. Plus Wendell and Lauri are both injury prone. When Wendell went down, we had to start Daniel Gafford, who was awful.  3. Get a second allstar to pair with Lavine - Whether we develop one of our current guys or hit gold in free agency, doesn‚Äôt matter, get Lavine a running mate. This is probably gonna have to come last, especially if we have to wait for free agency."
Maybe Daniel Gafford?
Zach Lavine is pretty cute. Same with Mont√© Morris. Daniel Gafford is alright too. Luka would look even better if he lost a bit of weight.
"I gave up watching Washington cause it's literally the saddest team in the league. I mean you have Beal who is literally leading the league in scoring on solid efficency and then you Westbrook who is once again doing his usual unicorn triple double business and the team still completely fucking sucks. Like how can you have two guys putting up HISTORICALLY GREAT levels of performance, Beal's scoring this year is as good as a year from prime Kobe, NO ONE cares though. It's so sad.   That and DC is in fucking no man's land in the saddest way. Like DC has some of the most promising young talents in the league. Deni is so good and gets used SO BADLY in DC. Rui has tons of potential but obviously he has to defer to the real stars of the team. Thomas Bryant is actually an offensive beast of a center but is injured rn.   For some reason they throw fucking Davis Bertans an $80 million contract like he's gonna be a piece for them to contend with. Like Bertans is a great shooter, he's no 3 and D guy though, he doesn't play defense well. Like for a proper 3 and D guy the money makes sense, for Bertans it's such a disgusting over pay.   You know what else made no sense? Trading Mo Wagner for Daniel Gafford. Like that trade says ""We're in rebuilding mode now"" Mo Wagner was actually really solid for DC defensively. At this point it really feels like a Beal trade is going to happen in the summer, like there's no way DC loads up on more developing talent while keeping the league leading scorer on the roster. Beal really does deserve better, DC doesn't deserve his loyalty. At least with Portland like Dame gets enough help to always keep Portland as a playoff team at worst and a dark horse at best. DC has literally none of that, there was hope that this year would be a playoff year for DC and that's completely failed.   DC needs to go all in and decide ""we're contending or rebuilding"". The franchise has been so sad since Wall signed that supermax only to get injured and it's completely ruined whatever potential there was. There might be an alternative universe where Wall never gets injured and DC continues to make noise in the East and stays comparable to the Celtic's with two great stars and a light chance of being a destination for FA's."
"Fwiw, the Wizards got Daniel Gafford from the Bulls in return. If he can avoid durability issues with his ankles, he projects to be an athletic rim-running rim protector with high upside and a team friendly contract, which is something that this team has badly needed for years."
we traded daniel gafford and chandler hutchison for mo wagner then immediately flipped wagner+luke kornet for theis
What title you winning with Daniel Gafford as your 4th best player
"buzzer beater trade for Mo Wagner, who we got for Daniel Gafford"
Daniel Gafford is a cutie
Stealing rebounds from whom? Alex Len? Daniel Gafford? Absolutely brain dead take
right now probably Daniel Gafford of the Chicago Bulls or WCJ of the Bulls
"I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs afraid of Daniel Gafford, but...is the big fella ducking him? #FearFlow"
Daniel Gafford was giving us the nastiest beat down ever in the 3rd. Eyes were popping out and kidneys were exploding and then Alex Len took all the rest of his minutes in the 4th it just doesn't make sense
"Scott Brooks has single handedly lost us close to 10 games this season.   1. He doesn't like calling timeouts ( leading to bad shots, and turnovers)  2. He doesn't like drawing up plays. Go Beal and Go Westbrook are his options.  3. He thinks playing Ish Smith with Russell Westbrook is good.  4. Adding on to that, he really likes 3 guard line ups including Westbrook, Smith, and Neto  5. He doesn't like playing Daniel Gafford who is our third best player."
I‚Äôm not sure how Daniel Gafford isn‚Äôt in the crunch time 5 there. Scott Brooks shouldn‚Äôt still have a head coaching gig
"Daniel Gafford goes 8/11 from the field in 16 min, yet Brooks plays Alex Len and his stone hands down the stretch"
Why the hell is Daniel Gafford not in? ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"imagine if the wizards win the play-in tournament, get the 8th seed, and beat the sixers because they traded for daniel gafford mid-season"
There's something about Daniel Gafford that looks like a computer-generated rookie in 2K.
Playmaker is what exactly?   He is successful because of his otherworldly athletecism and tenacity.   He is getting more skillful this year. He is releasing his jumper sooner which gives it more arc and makes it go in more.  His ballhandling is improved.  Even his actual passing looks improved like he has specifically been working on one handed passes with a trainer.  His decision making is still questionable at times.  Daniel Gafford and him look like they been friends since preschool though with the connection they have on the court.
I am very excited for a future where Thomas Bryant and Daniel Gafford are playing together for the Wizards.
"Jaxson hayes, Robert Williams, Daniel Gafford. Always enjoying watching these rim running bigs inject energy into the game"
Daniel Gafford has been such a nice pickup for the Wizards
Daniel Gafford Davis Bertans  Raul Neto  All these guys are pretty important to why the Wizards are hot right now
Daniel Gafford. Bulls could never utilize him enough to expose the gem that he really is
Embiid is a worse defender than Alex Len and Daniel Gafford
"\&gt;  Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back  That's Ainge's own fault . Could've traded Kyrie at the deadline and still got a lot for him. Horford was aging who cares. Hayward they could've gotten something back in S&amp;T (Myles Turner and some other pieces iirc) but chose not too.  After KD left the Thunder they changed the CBA to incentivize players to sign early extensions. Since then most stars have either signed early or worked out a trade. Beal himself has signed multiple early extensions with DC and can sign another one this summer or next, if he declines and says he wants to hit FA then he'll be traded for value. You're making up the least likely scenario  &gt;I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I‚Äôm not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)  Ish Smith carrying a load, that's hilarious lol. Wash have all their 1st rd picks other than the 2023 (protected), that represents an opportunity to add young talent every year. There are worse off teams who traded away multiple future picks, like the Bulls."
"I mean plenty of players leave in free agency and their teams get nothing. Celtics are a great example lost 2 all stars same off-season and got nothing back. KD one day got up and left the Thunder. Sure sign n trades are a lot more common these days but players still leave.   I really like Daniel Gafford, Rui and Thomas Bryant. But aside from those I‚Äôm not sure who under 25 the wizards have whose actually good. It feels like a majority of the load is carried by a bunch of aging vets (Lopez, smith, Westbrook)"
Daniel gafford is basically Rudy gobert on Lu dort money
Daniel Gafford is a monster. Chicago lost a good one.
Daniel Gafford had no problem dunking that over the reigning DPoY üò≥
Daniel Gafford living rent free in Brook's head wtf
Boy Chicago could really use Daniel Gafford rn
"Dude, the player in the g-league are experienced vets who knows the NBA far better than 18-20 yr old college players. Some of them are also past NBA players. Sure, there are better talents in college, but a lot of those guys are just got out of hs and still raw. What completely backwards are you saying? Those in the g-league are professionals already that has been playing for years already with access to NBA-level training and coaching if not close to it. Do you really think facing Drew Timmeh is harder than facing Daniel Gafford or Amir Johnson?"
Daniel Gafford
Please.  I watched him play for the Bulls for his whole career.  Nice energy guy who plays around the rim.   I like him as a player.  But lets not try to turn 24 minute a night Daniel Gafford into the second coming of the Dream
"He's making Daniel Gafford into a productive offensive player, I think so. It's either this year or his MVP year"
Idk man I think that‚Äôs blatantly ignoring the league-worst coaching and really weak overall team he‚Äôs playing with... Daniel gafford is the 4th best player on the team right now and he was barely even getting minutes on the worse Bulls team..
Daniel Gafford is very athletic.  I'm just saying to give it a shot. I don't really like how Russ had to guard Giannis at the end because the other guys were shit.
"* Daniel Gafford player page ‚Üí Tracking ‚Üí Passes Dashboard [(`link`)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629655/passes-dash/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals)  * Top table is ""PASS TO"" -- we want to scroll down to ""PASS FROM"" table at bottom.  -  ---  -  * Westbrook has assisted Gafford 31 times (32 total field goals, one of them must have not qualified)  * Gafford has 66 FGM with the Wizards so Westbrook has assisted on 47% of his made field goals  * Every other Wizard combined has assisted Gafford 19 times (28.8%)  * The remaining 24.2% were unassisted, a lot of them probably off offensive rebounds"
"| Brooks had drawn up a play, but when the huddle broke, he looked at the clock. He had 50 more seconds before the horn blew.

All thanks to the greatest chicago bull ever in daniel gafford
Daniel Gafford is very good
daniel gafford is pretty good
The Wizards' Big Three Era is here.  Russell Westbrook.  Bradley Beal.  Daniel Gafford.  (shoutout to raul neto he been fire these last games)
Where were you when Daniel gafford is kill
Daniel Gafford &gt; Wilt Chamberlain
"he‚Äôs a fake starter. He only averages 15mpg. Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford are the ones I‚Äôd give the credit to for their C position, especially over this run"
I am so fucking happy we have Daniel Gafford
What yall know about Daniel Gafford though?
Fellow unbiased opinion  MVP - Bradley Beal  DPOY - What‚Äôs defense  6MOTY - Davis Bertans  MIP - Daniel Gafford  COTY - Russel Westbrook  ROTY - Anthony Gill maybe Deni Avdija
"Hello, can I introduce you to one Daniel Gafford?  But for real, Westbrook is unstoppable right now."
"In which case, I'm going to recommend you try to catch some Wizards games because Daniel Gafford is playing some incredible ball lately.  The game against New Orleans last week... Damn!"
"\5. The little bumps and jabs of Robin Lopez Break up the Wiz! Washington has won eight of nine to pull ahead of the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors in the slap-fight for the last Eastern Conference play-in spot. Chicago and Toronto own head-to-head tiebreakers over Washington, but the Wiz have one of the league's easiest remaining schedules. They also have two games left against the wobbling Indiana Pacers, now just two games ahead at No. 9. (Washington is 1-0 against Indiana, so a split gives them that tiebreaker.)  The Wiz look more like the team a lot of us expected before the virus upended their season. Russell Westbrook has been a net positive over the past month, and he's 36-of-63 in the last five minutes of close games. Bradley Beal is scorching after a brief injury absence. Davis Bertans found his jumper. Their defense, once laughable, has stiffened.  The Wiz are getting two-way production from their old-school three-headed center rotation of Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford. I have no idea how that's a thing in the year of our basketball gods 2021, but it is. Len is fine as token starter. Gafford has been a rim-running, shot-blocking revelation since the Wiz acquired him from Chicago in an exchange of players so random it reads like some NBA geek's trade deadline Mad Libs.  Lopez is averaging 9.7 points on 69% shooting since March 1. He has cracked 15 points in seven of his past 13 games. For a selfless bruiser, that represents an explosion. Lopez has been money with his floor-scraping, ice-cream-scoop hook shot. The Wiz have scored 1.17 points per possession when Lopez shoots from the post or passes to a teammate who launches -- sixth (!) among 80 players with at least 50 post touches, per Second Spectrum data.  Lopez remains a devoted box-out maestro, and an expert at getting teammates open. He's always nudging and jostling defenders to pry open space for Washington's shooters.  Watch the little shoulder check he lays on poor De'Anthony Melton in the left corner, unlocking a layup for Bertans: https://media.video-cdn.espn.com/gifs/mp4/Lopez_2gif.mp4  Lopez strolls in Melton's general area before veering into him. He looks like some high school punk deliberately bumping someone in the hallway to start a fight."
No. You can really attribute the improvement to -  a) players are healthy(ish) now  b) daniel gafford acquisition  c) weaker schedule  his lineups are still ass and his play calling leaves a lot to be desired.
What Daniel Gafford does to a mfer
"He's looked poor, but he also clearly doesn't work work with the Bulls roster as currently constructed.  And, to be honest, given how well Wendell Carter Jr. and Daniel Gafford have been playing on new teams...  If he goes to a team with good team defense and good passers (cough Spurs cough), I think he'll succeed nicely."
"I literally have no idea how to discern between a bunch of former Chicago bench guys; Daniel Gafford, Denzel Valentine, Chandler Hutchinson. Seriously I don't even know what positions they play"
Wizards are 8-1 with Daniel Gafford on the court.
Have you heard of our lord and savior Daniel Gafford
"Congratulations, Daniel Gafford, you're our new defensive player of the year! That's what I would be saying if he weren't an inch too short. Next!"
Daniel Gafford is Rudy Gobert on a rookie scale contract change my mind
daniel gafford really just dared steph to shoot there like he‚Äôs ben simmons
"Daniel Gafford looks like the best center on the Wizards, including a healthy Thomas Bryant"
"Wizards-Bulls-Celtics trade:  Wizards give up Moe Wagner and Troy Brown Jr. to get Daniel Gafford and Chandler Hutchison  Celtics give up Daniel Theis and Javonte Green for Moe Wagner and Luke Kornet  Bulls give up Daniel Gafford, Chandler Hutchison, and Luke Kornet for Troy Brown Jr., Daniel Theis, and Javonte Green"
Daniel Gafford has been pretty good since we acquired him. 5-1 when he plays. The 1 loss .. I think Beal/Bertans weren't playing.
Daniel Gafford would start over Len. And that man is a beast.
"Daniel Gafford is a BEAST. Dude needs to start ASAP. He's the perfect big to play with Russ.  Speaking of which, Russ has been on absolute tear lately. Love to see it."
5-1 when Daniel Gafford plays...all imma say
"Moses Malone, Wes Unseld, Daniel Gafford, a trio of all time greats"
Nah no place for him in the rotation with Daniel Gafford and Kenneth Faried holding it down at the 5
"Really don't see that materializing .. mainly bc 1) Beal and Washington are heading towards a 5yr supermax extension in 2022 and neither party wants the trade and 2) if it came to it, GSW would need WAS to accept taking back the Wiggins contract which is negative value. They'd also have to pay Wiseman $10M/season which in the modern NBA is actually a lot of cash for a 5 who isn't appreciably better than the Thomas Bryant/Daniel Gafford rotation they have now.  With the assets Golden State has (assuming the Minn pick conveys) I think acquiring another team's franchise player is a bit optimistic but they could be in play for a high-level starter like Miles Turner , Sabonis or Jerami Grant. Grant in particular would be a great add for them imo"
Daniel Gafford looks great for the wizards right now!
behind Daniel Gafford
What will yall do if Brooks continues to play Alex Len over Daniel Gafford?
Daniel Gafford
Daniel Gafford
"Took Scott Brooks this long to realise how decent Daniel Gafford is, eh?"
daniel gafford come to memphis
the bulls rlly gave up daniel gafford for free
I love Daniel Gafford
"Next year, if they fire Brooks and hire a nice development coach like Kenny Atkinson, I think they could actually improve a lot and contend for a 4/5 seed. They would run out a lineup of Westbrook, Beal, Deni, Rui, and Thomas Bryant, which lacks in defense but isn't bad by any means. Brooks misuses Deni as a spot up and doesn't allow him to facilitate or playmake which hurts them a bit. Off the bench, they have some solid young defensive talent in Garrison Matthews and Daniel Gafford. Bertans could always bounce back from a bad year. They need to acquire some solid role players to fill out the bench.  Even despite these improvements, I also think their ceiling to me is a first or second round exit. Team lacks defense and Westbrook will always be a bit to a clunky fit. Logic would say they should blow it up now and get a haul for Beal, but I'm assuming the Wizards will hesitate to trade their star, who actively wants to stay in Washington. I'm just posing a scenario on which they could improve, but I doubt they ever reach contender status"
it‚Äôs daniel fucking gafford
I have never heard of Daniel Gafford before maybe a week prior to the playoffs. He was a nobody in a trade until he was forced to play for Wiz due to their depth  I'm not disparaging embiid by any means...but any fan should have expected this kind of performance a la Kd with GOAT warriors team
"Well, they do have Daniel Gafford, but everyone else is just BBQ chicken. It'll be interesting to see how Jo will deal with bigger bodies. Brook Lopez and Giannis are a formidable duo to try and deal with him."
"That‚Äôs easy to do when Alex Len, Daniel Gafford and Robin Lopez are playing defense on you"
Good practice for our bench mob to get playoff experience from legends like Daniel Gafford and Raul Neto
You won't be crying when Daniel Gafford leads the Wizards to 5 straight championships
Daniel Gafford has been playing well for the Wizards! Looks a lot better than he did on the Bulls.
Daniel. Gafford.
Aaron Gordon and Derrick for sure. I‚Äôd also add Daniel gafford to the list.
1.	Robin Lopez 2.	Bradley Beal 3.	Raul Neto 4.	Daniel Gafford 5.	Rui Hachimura
"in all honesty though, Scott Brooks using Alex Len to feel out refs and then swapping RoLo and Daniel Gafford based on team needs is actually very good coaching. Anyone who's watched DC this year has been graced with the spectacle that is RoLo's signature KAJ impersonation hook shot which has been actually one of DC's secret offensive weapons this year. Between that and Gafford's unreal energy balancing their minutes with the absorption role Alex Len plays by picking up fouls and getting the dirty work done he's made the 3 headed center beast work out pretty well in DC."
"It‚Äôs not like the Celtics have bigs, but Kornet plays pretty solid minutes now. Again, love me some Daniel Gafford, he can be so fun to watch. But he‚Äôs very limited in what he can do, and if given that specific role, will excel. Just do not expect anything past that, or you will be disappointed (at least until he develops more)."
"put daniel gafford on the lakers instead of AD, do they get worse?"
"Wow, he played well against Daniel Gafford and Alex Len. Truly the stuff of legend"
Alex Len is -16  Daniel Gafford is +25  Why does Len START??
"The Wizards are oddly well equipped to line up a Shaq like foul rotation among their centers.   * Robin Lopez: 3 fouls, 3 minutes * Alex Len: 2 fouls, 7 minutes * Daniel Gafford: 2 fouls, 4 minutes"
So many teams could use Daniel gafford
the wizards gotta get daniel gafford in. joel is gonna kill alex len
Another boneheaded move by the Bulls front office. Its not like the Bulls had to give away Daniel Gafford. The Bulls had already got Vooch in the prior trade. The second trade was unnecessary. Imagine if the Bulls had managed to pull of a Lonzo Ball trade. Lonzo and Gafford would of been a Hell of a site.
"Smaller players are always at a disadvantage when ""carrying"". But he was putting up enough numbers to do it. However, the Warriors just don't have the roster. Give them one more solid player like Daniel Gafford and a decent bench wing and they could do it."
"Allow me to introduce you to Daniel Gafford.  And now you can instantly forget his name, because Scott Brooks is going to give the Len/RoLo combo 48 minutes."
Alex len robin lopez and daniel gafford will attempt to stop embiid sixers in 5 lol

"The Bulls have a habit of sending their bigs out into the world to fuck shit up, we go through them so quickly. Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Omer Asik, Threekola Mirotic, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford. Next in line is Lauri Markkanen."
you really don't know who Ish Smith is? lol  you really don't know who Daniel Gafford is? lol
play in record setter daniel gafford
Daniel Gafford
i love Daniel Gafford very much.
Daniel Gafford is an easy answer
I WANT TO SUCK DANIEL GAFFORD
"If you‚Äôre Washington, are you starting Thomas Bryant or Daniel Gafford next year at center?"
Probably a good time to learn who Daniel Gafford is. He‚Äôs a top 3 reason the Wizards are here.
"If I were the Thunder, Daniel Gafford would have to be in the deal."
"It's kinda incredible how bad that Wizards roster is.   They surround Russ and Beal by starting Raul Neto and Alex Len.. Like why does Len even play when they have Robin Lopez and Daniel Gafford?   Ish Smith, who has played for 11 teams, was their best player off the bench.  Rui is okay but they could have had Herro, Thybulle, PJ Washington, or Brandon Clarke.  They drafted Deni Avdjia last year when they probably should have picked Haliburton since he fell.   I guess they're hoping Thomas Bryant and Deni come back.."
"I watched the game in Spanish after the first 2 minutes of the first quarter. I couldn't take it after he kept calling players the wrong names.  He called Gafford, Daniel Gabbert."
"Ish Smith deserved to be playing in the 4th quarter instead of Westbrook.  Garrison Matthews and Daniel Gafford should have gotten more PT.  They probably lose anyways because the team talent is just bad, but it's better than watching the whole team just clank bricks all night"
I cannot believe people were saying the Celtics would lose this game because of Daniel Gafford lmao
Yeah so how are the bulls doing this time of the year? Really wish the jazz had Daniel gafford and a couple role players to help boost our seeding right now
"I'd give Westbrook All-NBA before Beal. Beal's a great player, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the Wizards started winning when Russ got healthy and flipped the triple-double switch. To me, Russ' playmaking has done more to get the Wizards' other players involved than Beal's scoring. Players like Daniel Gafford, Davis Bertans, Robin Lopez, Garrison Matthews (when he plays) all noticeably got better with Russ playing well. Beal's the Klay Thompson of this team, but Russ is the Steph Curry."

"Having watched a lot of Wizards games, I'm not massively surprised by Daniel Gafford - man has been a beast for the last couple of months!  The others though, I did not expect."
They belong to Daniel Gafford now
"Daniel Gafford is better at those things than Gobert. Gobert is a way better player, because he‚Äôs the best defender in the league, but offensively he‚Äôs average at best for his position."
Season turned around with Daniel Gafford
Catch daniel gafford winning mvp in 5 years üëÄ
"Yes. He has the worst rotations of any coach. Beal has been out with injury and in the last game vs the Hawks Brooks pulled Rui Hachimura (the 3rd best player on the team) for the final 6 minutes while the team gave up a 19-9 run. He also refused to play our best center, Daniel Gafford, in favor of playing Alex Len during that run. (and that's a regular thing)  He doesn't coach an offense, and his defense only got better after we added Daniel Gafford (who again, he refuses to play regular minutes). He doesn't hold players like Russ accountable, but he'll bench a guy for multiple games in a row if he thinks he fouled too much or something. (Garrison Matthews needs more playing time, especially without Beal)"
depends on the series tbh if the nets get pushed to 7 and Daniel Gafford locks up KD ill have some words
Thanks for Daniel Gafford Chicago!
Daniel gafford
Daniel Gafford
They need a center that can just pack the paint and defend and catch oops when the time comes. As weird as it sounds I think a guy like Andre Drummond would be good here. Or even lesser known guys like Daniel Gafford and Stewart from the pistons would be helpful if they can just pack the paint for 40 mins and just use their length to turn away shots
Daniel Gafford should‚Äôve been on this team smh
"You are totally spot-on about spacing+rulebook. But that also points to ANOTHER flaw in analytics. Reliance on eFG% and TS% is also heavily flawed. Guys like Tyson Chandler, DeAndre Jordan, Rudy Gobert and now Daniel Gafford have over-inflated metric values offensively bc their shot diet is almost exclusively assisted restricted area buckets (to varying degrees, of course).  The point is that championship teams know how to win in any context, and that includes ugly. Teams and players that always try to dominate on schedule end up getting sent home come playoff time, when there are bound to be times the opponent makes the game ugly for you."
"Apparently the NBA only requires 20 FGM to qualify for the single playoff FG% leaderboard - so Daniel Gafford and his 84.6% (on 22 FGM) this year is going to shatter the official record, lol.  Bumping that up to 50 FGM gives you Gobert this year at #1 (74.1%) and DeAndre Jordan in 2015 at #2 (71.6%) ahead of Ayton.  Up it to 100 FGM and now Ayton is #1 *by far* - 71.1%, while #2 is only 62.2% (1985 James Worthy).  Since there was talk of guys like Shaq, let's add a 10 FGM per game qualifier to that as well. Probably not too surprising, the top 4 are Hakeem (61.5%), Shaq (61.2%), Kareem (60.7%), and Shaq again (60.6%) before it drops off to ~57% range. Shoutout to Kawhi this year at #6 (57.3%), the only one in the top 10 from the 2000's and on."
"Lifelong Bulls fan here. The trade definitely didn‚Äôt go as planned. They also gave up Gafford for a half season rental of Daniel Theis, who is a ufa and reportedly not interested in coming back, leaving a big hole off the bench at center.  Not much to do, but hope the off-season helps the team chemistry. AKME are obsessed with bigs, so it kind of looks like they are trying to recreate what they did in Denver and Philly. We have a big hole at pg, so a lot of rumors of trying to get Lonzo.   Lauri can walk, he‚Äôs a big disappointment and the team is hoping for a big jump from Patrick Williams. Definitely was a win now move that just didn‚Äôt work out. This next season will be the big test of the trade. It could still work Vuc is good."
Razorbacks producing these guys that just love the game. Daniel Gafford is the same way.
Yeah. He cheated on a test and went to Europe to play pro after his sophomore year. He was SEC  Freshman of the Year and would have had a big junior year too. And Arkansas fans don‚Äôt really fawn over Beverly. Bobby Portis‚Ä¶ Daniel Gafford‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll bring those guys up all the time. Rarely do you hear Arkansas fans bringing up Beverly. If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúblue collar‚Äù type of player and you aren‚Äôt really loved by the blue collar program you played at‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty telling.
"Great thread idea btw  For the jazz I wouldn't mind taking a chance on Cam Reddish, Jarret Culver, Justise Winslow, Denzel Valentine, Isaac Bonga, Chandler Hutchinson, Kris Dunn, Frank Ntilikina, Dante Exum, Kevin Knox, Derrick Jones Jr. Dwight Powell, Austin Rivers, Furkan Korkmaz, Torrey Craig, Jevon Carter, E'twaun Moore, Brandon Clarke if he's fallen out of favor with memphis. Malik Monk and Daniel Gafford were two at the start of the year but it was nice to see them each get their footing this year.   Taking a chance on two of any of these players would make for a nice offseason for me."
Daniel Gafford. We have him for 2 more years making under 2 million each year and he is really good at rebounding and defense (if he isn‚Äôt fouling) and is a good center for Westbrook to toss lobs to and he always brings high energy which I think is good to match with Westbrook as well.
Daniel Gafford winning MVP next season.
"No it wouldn't. They are a deep team. Capela is a great center that is a lob threat and good defender. Collins is a 4 that can shoot from outside and score inside. Bogdan is a versatile combo guard. Gallinari is one of the better bench players in the league and can shoot from anywhere with basically anyone guarding him. Huerter, Reddish, and Hunter all all decently good young players. Plus they picked up Lou Williams who can be useful in certain matchups.  The wizards third best player is probably Rui Hachimura or Davis Bertans. After them, their roster gets bad real quick. They're so bad that Daniel Gafford, a dude they basically picked up for free was a big game changer for them."
"[Per basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_minute.html), Timelord was 3rd in blocks per 36 min: Daniel Gafford - 3.4; Nerlens Noel - 3.3 (3.28); Timelord - 3.3 (3.32).    This doesn‚Äôt take into account pace, however. The Knicks were one of the slowest teams in the league last year, so this downplays Nerlens‚Äô impact a bit. If you look at blocks per 100 possessions, the Nerlens Wall is first: Noel - 4.6; Gafford - 4.5; Timelord - 4.5."

Daniel Gafford. There I said it
"Idk about all around super star, but Daniel Gafford has all defense and maybe even DPOY potential. He can be a defensive stud if he works on his endurance"
"&gt;Turns out having a 6'10 elite shooter with a lightning trigger who never stops moving to get himself open basically breaks NBA defenses,  On the other hand, Washington was +10.1 per 100 with Daniel Gafford on the floor, versus off.  So apparently having a slightly undersized center with 18 career starts, and who has never even attempted a single three-pointer in his career also ""breaks NBA defenses""."
"Exactly. MPJ is an elite play finisher, but Murray is way ahead of him in other aspects of the game like playmaking.   MPJ had one of the worst assist percentages in the league last year at 5.2%, good for 487th in the league.  For reference, the two players immediately ahead of him are Willie Cauley-Stein and Taj Gibson, and those right below him are Lauri Markkanen and Daniel Gafford.  To compare, before the injury Murray was 111th at 19.7%. Other similar shotmaking wings also rank a lot higher, like Tatum (113th, 19.6%), PG13 (67th, 23.9%), Brandon Ingram (87th, 21.8%).  On top of that, 79.2% of his made shots were assisted on. Other elite wings can create for themselves much more reliably, which is a huge part of being a top option.   To compare again: Murray (41.8%), Tatum (40.8%), PG13 (42.9%), Ingram (48.5%)  He's gonna be elite as a shotmaker, but to really be a 1B type guy he needs to make some big, big strides in other areas of his game, like playmaking and creating his own shot vs. it being created for him."
I think the bulls are going to be decent this year they're going to score a lot of points The only thing is they're going to give up a lot of points as well. Have they resigned Markkanen yet?  I don't know what his trade value is but they should consider trading him for a decent inside shot blocker rim runner type of player. They should have held onto Daniel Gafford he looks like he could end up being a productive player for Washington and exactly what this iteration of the bulls need right now
"Thank you for asking!  (in no particular order)  PG - Curry, Simmons, Fox, Killian Hayes, Rubio  SG - Kelly Oubre, Jalen Green, Lavine, Booker, Oladipo  SF - Tatum, Giannis, Aaron Gordon, Abdul Nader, Hayward  PF - Kuzma, Kevin Love, Hachimura, Ibaka, Obi Toppin  C - Nerlens Noel, Robert Williams III, Rudy Gobert, Daniel Gafford, Jarrett Allen"
Fuck it even Daniel Gafford is more relevant than Devonte Graham
"For all the credit they rightly deserve, the Chicago Bulls kind of did this to themselves with a smaller role last year as well.  They traded away an athletic rim-running, young back up center in Daniel Gafford, who had some flaws but played his role well enough in his 2nd year to warrant keeping.  Fast forward to this Summer, not six months later, and the Bulls biggest remaining need was a young, athletic, rim-running center who can rim protect.  They ended up with Tony Bradley who also fits the bill, but for what was ultimately a rental of Daniel Theis, I'd rather have kept Gafford on his rookie contract.   Genuinely glad he is doing well in Washington and I hope that continues this season."
"You idiots clearly lack reading comprehension, I didn‚Äôt say Kuzma=Ingram max him. I said Ingram  became a max player when he stopped playing with Lebron. And that Kuzma could redeem himself next year in a new setting.  Y‚Äôall literally act like a heliocentric offense has never stifled a players performance before. Kuzma clearly has the tools to be an nba player and now he‚Äôs going to an offense that managed to make Ish Smith, Raul Neto, Davis Bertrans, and Daniel Gafford look good.   Talk y‚Äôall shit bruh. The fact that I‚Äôm defending Kuzma against Laker fans says all you need to know about current Laker fandom. Y‚Äôall might be the most toxic fan base in the league right now."
Daniel Gafford 2: Electric Bugaloo
So basically Daniel Gafford in a bulls jersey 2.0
"Stay away from r/chicagobulls, it is a cesspool of Stans. The Mods are some of the worst Stans too. Many of them are still weeping over trading away Daniel Gafford lol. I wish I was lying."
"Bulls fans didn't have a strong opinion towards him either way but after the Wizards made the playoffs he put a video out on social media that was kinda rubbing it in that he made the playoffs and the Bulls didn't.   It wouldn't be a problem if it was someone like Daniel Gafford doing it since he actually seems legit and has room to trash talk but Hutch is an end of bench guy who will probably be out of the league before too long. We were like ""who does this clown think he is?"""
I‚Äôd settle for Daniel Gafford lol.
Daniel Gafford makes $1.8m this year and will make a whopping $1.9m next year
"Yeah like Westbrook put up nearly 12 apg last year feeding Daniel Gafford, Robin Lopez, and Alex Len. People saying he won‚Äôt help or even will hurt one of the best big men in the league are lunatics"
"So you‚Äôre including teams where the player hadn‚Äôt won MVP yet?   Then the 2021 Washington Wizards, with future MVPs Bradley Beal, Deni Avdija and Daniel Gafford."
"Shortly after the Washington Wizards‚Äô season ended with a first-round playoff loss, general manager Tommy Sheppard dropped a hint of what was to come.  ‚ÄúThis is not a run-it-back team,‚Äù he said.  Now, it‚Äôs official. Changes are arriving. Big ones.  Just before Thursday‚Äôs NBA Draft, the Wizards and Lakers agreed to a deal that will send Russell Westbrook to Los Angeles for Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No. 22 pick, sources told The Athletic. Washington also will route a 2024 and a 2028 second-round pick to L.A. The swap won‚Äôt become official until the start of free agency on Aug. 6.  As Bradley Beal spent the last few weeks mulling his future with the organization, as The Athletic previously reported, Westbrook also was deciding his own. The former MVP, who is from the L.A. area, spent parts of the offseason discussing the possibility of teaming up with four-time champion LeBron James and eight-time All-Star Anthony Davis. Westbrook had a growing desire to join James and Davis in Los Angeles to compete for a championship, sources said. He formally informed the Wizards of his desires recently, according to sources: if they could find a trade that works, Westbrook wanted to go to the Lakers.  They landed on one.  Washington executed the deal with no issues from Beal, per sources. The three-time All-Star, who is entering the final season of his contract, has expressed no desire to leave the Wizards, according to sources. As speculation about his future has swirled, the team remains confident it can keep him for the long term. The Wizards can offer him a four-year, $180 million extension in October, but if he waits until 2022 free agency, he can sign a five-year contract for an estimated $235 million to return to Washington.  One of the main reasons Westbrook wanted to come to D.C. when the Wizards traded John Wall for him in December was the presence of head coach Scott Brooks, who coached the former MVP from 2008-15 in Oklahoma City. But the Wizards did not retain Brooks when his contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season despite Westbrook‚Äôs outspoken recommendation that they should.  Westbrook preferred a more established coach to replace Brooks, according to sources. The Wizards eventually hired former Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr., whose r√©sum√© includes 16 years as an NBA assistant and eight more as an advance scout.  The Lakers set an offseason goal to acquire an elite playmaker next to James and Davis. They deemed Westbrook worthy. He averaged a triple-double during his one season in D.C., the fourth time in five years he‚Äôs done so. Many in the Wizards organization praised him for how he changed the team‚Äôs culture and work ethic. He will turn 33 years old at the start of next season and has two years and $91 million remaining on his contract.  The Wizards believe the package from the Lakers improves their depth. They view Caldwell-Pope, one of Beal‚Äôs closest friends in the league and the type of player they have sought after for years, as their next starting small forward. Washington went into the offseason hoping to improve its defense and long-range shooting. Caldwell-Pope can guard the perimeter physically and is versatile. He sank 41 percent of his 3-point attempts last year.  He will reposition 2020 first-round pick Deni Avdija to the bench, the Wizards‚Äô preferred spot for the 20-year-old as he returns from a fractured fibula.  The trade gives Washington more roster flexibility, too. Westbrook has a couple of seasons remaining on a supermax contract. Breaking his deal into three middling ones could make it easier for the Wizards to pull off trades for more reasonable salaries.  Harrell is only one year removed from winning NBA Sixth Man of the Year and averaged 13.5 points per game for the Lakers last season, but he fell out of their rotation during the playoffs. Kuzma has improved as a defender and shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in 2020-21. Both create redundancies on what‚Äôs now an imbalanced roster.  Renovations are coming ‚Äî especially at point guard, where the team has an obvious, Westbrook-sized hole.  Sources say to keep an eye on 28-year-old free agent Spencer Dinwiddie, who missed most of last season with a torn ACL but averaged 20.6 points per game in 2019-20. The Wizards are above the salary cap but could try to negotiate a sign-and-trade with Dinwiddie‚Äôs incumbent team, the Nets. The other pieces from the Westbrook trade, Harrell and Kuzma alone, would not be enough for Brooklyn to accept a Dinwiddie deal, according to a source. Dinwiddie is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Nets, Knicks, Heat and Raptors, sources said.  The Wizards made a smaller move for a point guard Thursday, flipping the No. 22 pick, which they received in the Westbrook trade, to the Pacers for fourth-year guard Aaron Holiday and No. 31, which netted them 19-year-old stretch 4 Isaiah Todd. Washington grew enamored with Holiday when he worked out for them before the 2018 draft and actually tried to trade for him a year ago.  That wasn‚Äôt all. The Wizards‚Äô Thursday night also included selecting 22-year-old sharpshooter Corey Kispert with the No. 15 pick, which gives them another 3-point threat. Kispert, who made 44 percent of his long-range attempts last season at Gonzaga, was the top shooter on the Wizards‚Äô list and No. 10 on their draft big board, a source said. Sheppard mentioned in a news conference that the Wizards explored trading up for him before taking him 15th.  Washington is now capable of loading lineups with shooters, something it seriously struggled with in 2020-21 when it neither made nor took many 3-pointers. It finished 23rd in 3-point percentage and 29th in 3-point rate (the percentage of their field-goal attempts that came from beyond the arc). Now, it can piece together units with Beal, Kispert, Davis Bertans, Thomas Bryant and whomever it has at point guard. Caldwell-Pope will fit in there, too. The Wizards now have 3-point menaces.  If Dinwiddie does not end up in D.C., options remain. This summer‚Äôs free agency class is rich with capable point guards ‚Äî from top-flight ones (who are not realistic for Washington), like Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry to more reasonably-priced ones, like Reggie Jackson, Patty Mills, Cameron Payne and Devonte‚Äô Graham, amongst others. A reunion with free-agent Raul Neto, who spot-started for the Wizards last season, is a possibility, sources say.  They can use the mid-level exception, worth up to $9.5 million, to sign free agents. The Westbrook and Holiday trades, which shave more than $5 million from their payroll, give them extra room to operate below the luxury tax line. They also created an $8.5 million trade exception in the Westbrook deal, which they can use to trade for a player who makes up to $8.6 million (yes, it‚Äôs confusing, but that‚Äôs not a typo) without having to match salaries in the exchange.  For now, the roster is unbalanced. But moves are coming. Teams can begin speaking to free agents on Aug. 2.  The Wizards have 15 players under contract. But with Westbrook gone and both Neto and Ish Smith hitting free agency, they have only one point guard in Holiday, a 24-year-old who was a backup in Indiana last season and projects to hold a similar role in 2021-22.  They have a logjam of 3/4 types. Rui Hachimura, Avdija, Bertans, Kuzma and Chandler Hutchison all overlap in some way or another. Kispert could fit into this player type, too. They‚Äôre adding the second-rounder Todd to the mix too. Power forward Anthony Gill and wing Caleb Homesley are under contract but are non-guaranteed for 2021-22.  They have another crowd at center with three players who warrant playing time: Bryant, Harrell and Daniel Gafford ‚Äî though Bryant will miss the beginning of the season as he continues to recover from the ACL he ruptured in January. The Wizards hope he can return by December, according to a source, though it‚Äôs difficult to lock in a specific return time this far out.  But this is not what the roster will look like at the start of the season. The Wizards, after all, were not a run-it-back team. And now, they are officially not running it back."
it is when the other starters Alex Len and Garrison Matthews  Daniel Gafford barely got burn w the Bulls and then was one of the best players for Washington   Wizards are ass man
"I don't think people realise that the best pick and roll big guy Russ has ever had to play with was Daniel Gafford.  He has AD, and Bron now.  When the Lakers go small, they are literally going to be the most OP team now with Russ, filler, filler, Bron and AD"
"y‚Äôall are acting like dude is a ball hog. Russ gets his teammates involved and is dream come true for most centers in the pnr (Exhibit A: Steven Adams, Exhibit B; Daniel Gafford)"
bro Russ was putting in work in PnR with Steven Adams and Daniel Gafford lmao he‚Äôll tear it up with AD
"Same thing with the Nets earlier this season. As much as people want to say Westbrook will kill the spacing, he's never played with a playmaker like LeBron before who can get him great looks, (I guess Harden if you want to compare the two) while at the same time being able to dish it at the same time to a scorer like AD  &amp;#x200B;  This is the playmaker the LeBron has always wanted. Westbrook last season had a guy like Daniel Gafford look like a solid offensive big man and he can definitely take the load off of LeBron, much better than Schroder ever could"
"Mo is averaging 3.2 block per 36 **for his NBA career** on only 4.6 fouls per 36.  There are only 4 players averaging 3+ blocks per 36 this year: Noel, Gobert, Timelord, and Daniel Gafford on 14 minutes a game.    There are only 11 other players who averaged even 2 blocks a game with qualifying games played.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_per_minute.html  Bamba is getting the blocks.  The difference is he didn‚Äôt swallow people on defense the way Mobley did.  No one was calling Mo a generational defensive talent, the comparison is not apt IMHO."
"Sans-Utah Reggie was like a 35% 3 point shooter in the playoffs. *Passable* is the word to describe his shooting, contrast that with DeRozan who just isnt particularly interested in 3 pointers for himself, and to his credit he hasnt needed it. Demar has been a 20 ppg scorer at 60% TS the last 2 years *without* the 3. He's plenty efficient on offense. And he just clocked his most efficient season as a distributor as well and there are a lot of ways a wing can exist to space the floor without a spot up jumper. Like Jimmy doesn't shoot 3s well either but he still spaces the floor on and off the ball because he distributes the ball when he has it and cuts when he doesn't.  We have 5 guys who shot over 40% this last season from 3 who're currently slated to come back (and then Cousins and Reggie). Some of that is gonna regress next year (and I believe Reggie is a prime regression candidate, I'd love for him to prove me wrong but he had a career year last season) but imho you have room to have 1 non shooter on the floor if that non shooter is useful to your offense in other ways as a vertical spacer (Capela, lob city era DeAndre Jordan, Giannis, Daniel Gafford, Zion, etc) or as a distributor (Jimmy, DeRozan, etc)"

"Russ played with Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford last year. All three of those guys benefited from Russ's play. The idea that he Russ doesn't gel with big men is very wrong. His interior passing and rim running passes are how he gets a ton of assists."
"Yeah which is why teams usually take a chance on a super raw young guy, or an older guy with some clear role player skills. Edwards just didn't make sense ahead of guys like THT and Daniel Gafford"
"He‚Äôs not replacing his minutes. Westbrook is. The conversation about who is a better playmaker/ better fit with AD between Russ and Schroeder doesn‚Äôt need to be had. Russ turned Daniel Gafford into a starting caliber offensive player last year. Schroeder vs Rondo is a relevant conversation because Schroeder was brought in to replace what Rondo gave them in the playoffs (passable defense and shooting, feeding AD) but at a higher rate and over a full season on starters minutes. He failed miserably at the shooting and feeding AD and his defense was largely replaceable which is why he‚Äôs been replaced."
"I have. Which is why I know AD will love playing with him. As does every single roll man who‚Äôs ever played with him. Steven Adams, Ibaka, Daniel Gafford, Kanter, even Nick Collison. If you‚Äôre a big who can roll, grabs ORBs and especially catch lobs you feast with Russ."
Russell Westbrook made Daniel Gafford a fantasy gem at the end of last season. I‚Äôm sure AD is gonna be fine.
Not really a guy touted to be something more than a roleplayer but here is a bold fucking prediction: Daniel Gafford is going to be a top 10 center in the future.
"Zion is Daniel gafford   To stop Zion, you need to be extremely aggressive. He‚Äôs gonna get calls anyway you go at him but if you go soft he‚Äôll be more effective, gafford being aggressive with blocks neutered Zion a bit.   Zion obviously gets blocked a lot but Gafford really had him on the ropes for a while. One thing to note though is that gafford had like 5 fouls in 25 minutes (OT game)"
Daniel Gafford over LeBron James??? Who da fuq is this guy??
wendell carter and daniel gafford
Daniel Gafford will take another big leap this season. Watch
Daniel Gafford  Mitchell Robinson  Rudy Gobert
You do realize Centers will always have higher shooting percentages than guards because they play around the rim? What that stat measures is how efficiently a player can score. Daniel Gafford probably had a great ts% because he had Russ spoon feeding him layups/dunks. That doesn‚Äôt make him a better player or shooter. But it does show us that he scores more efficiently.
How the hell did Bradley Beal out-rebound Daniel Gafford?
"Yeah I remember being pretty upset that the Bulls passed on him because I figured with a 2nd round pick you might as well go for a high-risk/high-reward type since so many 2nd rounders amount to nothing anyway.   The guy the Bulls picked instead was Daniel Gafford, who right now looks like he's going to have a much better career."
"Daniel Gafford was in that class too, got extended by Washington and is a starting C now"
"Just going to go with cities with 4 C's for reference.  San Francisco: James Wiseman, Alex Mack, Buster Posey, Logan Couture  Los Angeles: Anthony Davis, Corey Linsley, Will Smith, Anze Kopitar  Arizona: DeAndre Ayton, Max Garcia, Carson Kelly, Johan Larsson  Denver: Nikola Jokic, Lloyd Cushenberry III, Elias Diaz, Nathan MacKinnon  Dallas: Kristaps Porzingis, Tyler Biadasz, Jose Trevino, Tyler Seguin  Minnesota: Karl Anthony-Town, Garrett Bradbury, Mitch Garver, Joel Eriksson Ek  Chicago: Nikola Vucevic, Sam Mustipher, Yasmani Grandal, Johnathan Toews  Miami: Bam Adebayo, Greg Mancz, Nick Fortes, Alexsander Barkov  Washington D.C: Daniel Gafford, Chase Roullier, Keibert Ruiz, Evgeny Kuznetsov  Cleveland: Jarrett Allen, JC Tretter, Roberto Perez, Boone Jenner  Detroit: Isaiah Stewart, Evan Brown, Jake Rogers, Dylan Larkin  Philadelphia: Joel Embiid, Jason Kelce, JT Realmuto, Claude Giroux  New York: Mitchell Robinson, Billy Price, Gary Sanchez, Mathew Barzal  Boston: Robert Williams III, David Andrews, Christian Vazquez, Patrice Bergeron"
"I don't know if you know this, but Deni Avdija and Daniel Gafford have been seen as the greatest duo in NBA history by those of us smart enough to see it"
"I'm fairly certain the idea is that a 36 year old lebron cannot be your primary ballhandler and playmaker for what you hope to be 100+ games this year, regular season and playoffs.   Yeah, he is bionic or whatever, but even cybernetics have limitations.   So you bring in Russ, who just spend a year making Alex Len, Robin Lopez, and Daniel Gafford look like an above average center rotation, and have him be your playmaker for the regular season. Or at least large stretches of it. LeBron still going to take over late in any close games.   LeBron can rest a bit playing off ball more, AD should feast on the PnR with him, they have some decent shooting to spread around him.   They'll cruise to the playoffs, and then LeBron takes over once he is back in his natural habitat. And hopefully by then they'd have figured out how to make russ fit into the lebron offense.     What is concerning is that I didnt see like any of that yesterday, it was the LeBron/AD show all game long.  And if that's the plan this season, lebron still as like the primary ballhandler and playmaker when he is on the floor... I dont know how they are going to make it work."
"Move JJJ down to the 4 spot, and add either Robert Williams or Daniel Gafford as the breakout candidate at the 5 spot"
"For context, this is Daniel Gafford money.  If you think that JV is going to want more $$ later, this isn‚Äôt a bad deal."
Lol Russ got Daniel Gafford 3 years 40 million
"It's clearly a steal based off market value, especially when you consider he's still developing. Guys like Daniel Gafford are getting 3 yrs $40 mil its a joke compared to the value of someone like Mikal"
If Brad Beal was 6‚Äô6‚Äù and Daniel Gafford was 7‚Äô1‚Äù DC would be damn near unstoppable

"Daniel ""DGAF"" Gafford"
"Again, you clearly didn‚Äôt watch us last season. Beal averaged 30+ ppg and Daniel Gafford came in at the trade deadline to revamp our abysmal interior defense. You‚Äôre just a boxscore watcher.  You keep saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt sniff shit without him‚Äô, as if barely making the play-in game and then getting bounced immediately is something that the fanbase is dying to see. We all wanted to tank this year for Cade. Low seeded playoff runs are worthless considering the position the team is in with the roster/salary cap. That ain‚Äôt the kind of ‚Äúshit‚Äù we‚Äôre trying to sniff. GTFO with your broken record nonsense. You aren‚Äôt adding anything to the discussion other than showing off how hard you cape for Russ."

"See this is what i‚Äôm talking about. He didn‚Äôt carry us into the playoffs. He started off the year incredibly poorly, which put us hopelessly behind. As the team got healthy, we won a bit more. The trade for Daniel Gafford and the implementation of the 3 center rotation was ultimately what helped us become consistent. Beal having an all nba season was the cherry on top, as his consistent elite production finally resulted in wins when everyone else performed around him. To say Westbrook carried us to the playoffs is blatantly ignorant of our entire season. I‚Äôm not surprised that you think this, as you have Westbrook flair so you likely didn‚Äôt watch any of our games."
"&gt;ere might be another Draymond Green or Paul Millsap who's about to make his breakout that was drafted in like 2019 that just isn't on our radar right now  That 2019 second round coincidentally has a lot of guys who could pop off this season:   Nicolas Claxton, KZ Okpala, Daniel Gafford, Eric Paschall, Isaiah Roby, Talen Horton-Tucker, Terance Mann, Jalen McDaniels.  Then there's the ultimate wildcard in Bol Bol."
"My most heard thing by ppl who dont know what theyre talking about when trying to analyze a game is *""What is the coach doing with these substitutions?!""*   Sometimes its accurate and you have Jim Boylen playing Luke Kornet over Daniel Gafford every night, but more often than not its the same rotation of 8 guys as all season and sometimes last season. Its often said to me even when the fucking starters are back in"
They just need to play Daniel Gafford more.
Everyone has these high standards for big man play now?! Ben can be a 4/5 in this league with his defense alone. Not like he‚Äôd be matching up against Embiid and Jokic every night.   There are smaller and worse 4s. There are also bigger players that play no D at all. Daniel Gafford just started at C in the playoffs last year. You‚Äôd take Kelly Olynyk or Daniel Gafford at big before Ben?
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.

Wizards had their injuries in the first part of the season. They finished 19-10 after picking up Daniel Gafford to *finally* replace Thomas Bryant who went down early.
"This! He impacts the game in every way, not just scoring. He is obviously a scoring threat, but also a passing threat, and a rebounding threat. He knows we‚Äôre his teammates are and how they play and how to best use them. He made Daniel Gafford and Robin Lopez look really good by his incredible playmaking"

We made Daniel Gafford look like shaq
"Yes, Daniel fuckin Gafford was the difference maker"
how dare you forget the great daniel gafford lol
"No, Beal wasn't great in the second half. He became a lot more of a volume scorer in the second half where he put up a lot of shots to get to 30 pts. Beals first half last year was a lot better. Like obviously being able to score at will is very important and not many can do that .. but Beal had pretty high usage   Westbrook was doing a lot.    TBH that bigger difference was ...  1. Daniel Gafford provided some defense and rim-running which was desperately needed.  2. Our schedule was  much much easier in the second half, than first."
Wizards: Daniel Gafford
Melo's hit some 3's.  Only has a foul but he's lucky he doesn't have two. Kyle Kuzma thinks he's much better than he is. Nick Richards met his dad Daniel Gafford. Good first quarter but you haven't missed much.
Daniel Gafford knows what‚Äôs up.  [Hey Charlotte! Guess what?](https://twitter.com/dmvbriannn/status/1460334000086654987?s=21)
"Just cruise through the tonne of posts on the Wizards sub man.  Soo many bed references, even **Daniel GAFFORD** was talking about the Wizards bed on Cameo."
Westbrook was a good leader. Can‚Äôt take that away from him. He helped a lot of our young guys like Deni and Rui gain confidence and also helped Daniel Gafford a lot. It‚Äôs the on court stuff where I would cringe with Westbrook sometimes
"Well they turned Westbrook, Troy Brown Jr, Moe Wagner, and Chandler Hutchison into Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell, Aaron Holiday, Isaiah Todd, Daniel Gafford."
I saw way too much of Myles's offensive skillset on display at the Wizards home opener this year when he got 40/10 and made Daniel Gafford (a very good defender) look silly.
"Wizards got Dinwiddie, Trez, KCP, Kuzma, healthy Deni, Daniel Gafford with more experience  AND they got rid of the worst coach in the league.  That's why they're off to a better start from last year."
"It's a shame we didn't have time, we needed to make moves to keep Zach. I'm not worried about Vooch, he'll come around. Love to see WCJ and especially Daniel Gafford playing well on their respective teams."
And Daniel Gafford who at least partially came from former Laker Moe Wagner.
"We literally have Daniel Gafford. No, you‚Äôre not better."
"No he's on the Raptors now, but he played quality ball for us for 2 seasons.   I remember how we got him. To free up space for Anthony Davis, the Lakers traded Isaac Bonga, Moe Wagner, and Jemerrio Jones to the Wiz for cash considerations. Jones was released immediately, but Bonga and Mo became decent players for us.  Then, Mo was involved in the package that got us Daniel Gafford.   Tommy Sheppard is a genius"
&amp; fleeced the Bulls for Daniel Gafford
"Could I, perhaps, interest you in 16 minutes of Alex Len, 16 minutes of Robin Lopez, and 16 minutes of Daniel Gafford?"
