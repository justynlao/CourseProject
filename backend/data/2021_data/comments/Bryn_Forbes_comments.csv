"Ah yes, because shooters such as Bryn Forbes, Lonnie Smith Jr. and Buddy Hield are known for their defence"
"Any defense that plays Bryn Forbes and DJ Augustin major bench minutes will suffer. Anyways last season the Bucks defense was just as good without Brook Lopez on the floor, why? Because of Giannis. Giannis at 5, giannis at 4, it didn't matter. All his numbers and stats were elite."
"A little bit but by far the biggest decider in the NBA is talent on your roster. Honestly in terms of helping the spurs win games last season, I thought Pop might have been a negative because he was starting Bryn Forbes and played him the third most minutes on the team up until the bubble."
"Pfft, those are some rookie numbers. DJ Augustin was -21 in 4 minutes and Bryn Forbes was -31 in 11 minutes..."
"Nah, check out Bryn Forbes.   -31 in 11 minutes"
"Yea, it feels like LaMarcus has really taken a step back defensively this season. He still has good offense though, and can still shine in certain match ups. I would be happy to sign him next year still, but not for all star kind of money. A modest 2-3 year deal would still be nice.   &gt;	But also, come on it wasn‚Äôt just Bryn. It was Bryn, Marco, and Patty lineups that were murdering us lol  Yea, that‚Äôs kind of my point. Forbes was getting way more flack than anyone else though. There were basically no good defensive lineups last season."
"The previous 2 years with the same scheme, opposing teams shot slightly below average from three against the Bucks. This year, Bryn Forbes is getting heavy minutes off the bench and he might be the worst perimeter defender in the NBA. Going from Wesley Matthews to Forbes is a very big downgrade on defense. Also George Hill to DJ Augustin is a big downgrade on defense. And the Bucks have Brook Lopez in the starting lineup and he‚Äôs much more effective when he doesn‚Äôt switch on screens but that can occasionally lead to some decent looks for the opponent from three. Other than that, other teams have just had lucky nights like when Bledsoe made 7 contested threes last night."
"Just having the flashes has been a huge positive. The young guys with the bodies and athletic tools to play that level of defense are promising enough that you can forgive some of the weaker quarters knowing we're still in the learning phase with most of these players. You see the potential and you see consistent improvements over time and you feel like we could get there.  In contrast, with Forbes and Marco playing big minutes last season the flashes weren't there and what was worse than how bad we were defensively was that there was no light at the end of the tunnel for that group. There was no conceivable world where a lineup of Patty, Bryn, Marco, Demar all on the floor at the same time was going to become a passable defense.  Now there's a realistic chance we reach that ""consistently good"" ceiling."
"Good god, why is Poetl‚Äôs offense becoming the new thing that everyone in /r/Nbaspurs complains about now? First it was demar sucks because he can‚Äôt shoot threes, then it was Bryn Forbes is single handedly causing the spurs to have the 28th or whatever ranked defense, and for a while it was even Pop is washed up and can‚Äôt coach anymore. Jesus fucking Christ just enjoy watching your team. Jakob is an awesome defensive center and he played great tonight.   Not every single player on a team is going to be good at every single aspect of the game. That‚Äôs fine. Jakob still fits in with this team without a three point shot."
Bryn Forbes is...really awful.   I tried to warn y'all.
"On the flip side though, Middleton went 5/8, Lopez was 2/3, Bobby Portis was 2/4, and Bryn Forbes and DJ Augustine each shot 3/6 from 3. It was a pretty normal 3 point shooting night for the team (36.4 compared to 39.3 on the season), just some high variance on an individual level."
Bryn Forbes effect
"So many commenters didn't actually read the article and it shows. What Tjarks actually means is that Giannis should be focusing on developing his midrange and floater game so that defenses can't blatantly wall him off. Yeah Giannis can't shoot, but if he can't, why is he pulling up from deep in the first place?  Most importantly, Tjarks noted the differences in how AD and Giannis are utilized defensively. The Bucks could definitely learn a thing or two from how the Lakers utilize AD as a small ball 5, and how AD uses his tools to guard anyone effectively. That would be preferable to using Giannis as a free safety defender, seeing how their defense has downgraded due to the loss of defensive players like George Hill, Robin Lopez and Bledsoe. Bryn Forbes can't guard a toothbrush, and Portis gets cooked by big men on a nightly basis."
"Those are pretty tough ones, but I‚Äôll try: Kostas Antetokounmpo, Nick Claxton, Kent Bazemore, Ivica Zubac, Bryn Forbes, Maxi Kleber, Matisse Thybulle, Nickel Alexander-Walker, Caleb Martin, aaaaaaand Damian Lillard?"
Who‚Äôs ready to watch bryn Forbes miss mid rangers??
Kuz trying to keep up with bryn forbes on the perimeter is like me trying to keep up with my parents expectations
Yea like Bryn Forbes hahaha  Aha...
"Nah these were pick and rolls mostly. I wanted to for one game keep a tally of how many Giannis/Middleton or Giannis/Jrue pick and rolls Milwaukee ran in a game for shits because it's been alot higher this year. Last night happened to be the game I finally got to do it for. Giannis/Jrue ran 12 pick and rolls(even if they didnt directlyr esult in shots). Giannis screened for Jrue on all of them. Giannis/Middleton ran 9 pick and rolls mostly late, Giannis screened for all of them.   He screened a couple times for Bryn Forbes on hand offs but mostly it was just him screening for their two best perimeter shot creators to try to separate and create. They did not use Giannis as a short roll man to playmake like Draymond. Giannis did roll to the basket several times but usually not in these situations. Middleton in particular the goal was obvious get a good screen on Duranta nd get KM free for a pull up 16 footer."
"Again with the outlier data. One person says some nonsense and you quote it like it is the opinion of everyone. ü§°ü§°ü§°  Middleton is the number 2 option, a great shooter, and has the green light just as much and Giannis. You are acting like Bryn Forbes is taking the ball out of Giannis‚Äô hands.   Again, for emphasis, ü§°ü§°ü§°"
Except Bryn Forbes
Spurs fans tried to warn us about Bryn Forbes...
"Whenever broadcasters say, ""you know the Spurs had to figure out how to deal with the**loss** of Bryn Forbes in the off-season..."" I'm like, it's fine that you didn't watch the Spurs last year, but you didn't have to make something up."
Why are we giving Bryn Forbes crunch time possessions???
Like if the bucks were attacking the rim this game they‚Äôd be getting nice easy looks and instead you‚Äôre letting Bryn Forbes shoot FT line Js
Why the fuck are they having Bryn Forbes brick like 43 consecutive mid range shots off a screen?
Bryn Forbes is just garbage
Augustin and Bryn Forbes are equally terrible
"I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say Aldridge is a bad player overall at this point- but what he does well at this stage doesn‚Äôt really add much to them, and what he does poorly would be disastrous for them as a team.   I thought bryn Forbes was the biggest net negative defender I had ever seen. Then 2021 Lamarcus Aldridge happened. He is the target of the opposition every possession, too slow to guard the pick and roll, too flat footed to protect the rim, too slow to react to guard the perimeter against shooting bigs.   He might give you 20. He might score 30 if he‚Äôs really hot. But he‚Äôs going to give it back on the other end and then some."
Better than Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes? please
"Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Gary Neal. Ginobili too but not the streakiest."
It‚Äôs always appreciated when people don‚Äôt say anything and just hold up a picture of Bryn ‚ÄúBaby Bash‚Äù Forbes
Be cool if they actually produced consistently off the bench. Bobby Portis dropped 20 and Bryn Forbes hit 14 but our bench is so wildly inconsistent.
What a scrub! Trade him to us for a legit shooters like Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton. This Steph guy needs a Giannis to create him open shots his bum ass can hit. /s
The Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis effect
Bryn Forbes is doing the same that doesn‚Äôt mean they are good defenders
"Bucks fans are all over the place, I want to cite Bryn Forbes as an example. First few games when he got hot from the 3, people were praising him and talking about how his defense improves being around all defensive type players.   Fast forward a few more games, he‚Äôs hit a cold streak, all I see now is comments questioning how Bryn Forbes is in the NBA or saying he should never get minutes if he can‚Äôt shoot. I understand the premise, but the execution is EXTREME. But that is most of basketball fans on Reddit, extreme overreactions from small sample sizes.   In all honesty through these first ten games the bucks haven‚Äôt solved the big issue. That Jazz game was a prime example of our team falling apart because of better coaching. Giannis cannot do everything for us and he‚Äôs being taken advantage of on defense. To me, this cavs game should have been a blowout. They are missing their starting front court, and they still kept within 10. We need to increase Middleton and Jrues usage rates and either fire Bud or force him to adjust. His rotations don‚Äôt make sense sometimes, and he‚Äôll leave a player on the floor when that player is cold, or another player is really hot and gets benched. Doesn‚Äôt make sense."
But wat about Bryn Forbes
Haven't watched much Bryn Forbes til this year... he's gotta be near the top of the list of current players who jump high on their jumpers. Idk if he's actually jumping high or if it's something about his form that's tricking me into thinking that
To be fair a lot of our struggles last year came from Pop playing Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli more minutes than he should have and having a system that consisted of Aldridge/DeRozan/Gay midrange ISO ball.  From the bubble til now Pop has really done a great job though.
I do think Bogdanovic would fit better in the Bucks offense but the way that five have been playing I can't say they're regretting not having him too much. With the addition of Bryn Forbes I feel as if it'd be a little redundant if Bogdan was the starter and he was the backup though.
"Donte and Bogdan roles in their respective offense are so different and small sample size I wouldn‚Äôt read too much into it if I were u. Donte been looking like a knock down spot up in these early games except last night tho.   Bench is whatever tbh. Connaughton was coming back regardless because he‚Äôs Giannis work out buddy, DJA, Bryn Forbes, Bobby Portis are whatever. The value of vet min of them ring chasers could still prob give u same production anyway."
Bryn forbes
"He actually had a positive on off last season when he was on and Bryn Forbes was off, his minutes essentially being tied to Forbes for a lot of the season is what dragged it down  It also didn‚Äôt help that White/Mills played better off the bench than DJM starting"
I can't believe it took Pop til the bubble to stop starting Bryn Forbes and just play small. They look so much better.
"Naw, DeMar and the rove of guards can all shoot, dribble, drive, and dish. They attack the basket relentlessly and with efficiency, and they swarm on defense as best they can. They're good. They can't compare to Timmy era spurs, early or late end, but they're still good alright.  DeJounte looks ready, Keldon Johnson looks like the real deal, Derrick White is back, Lonnie Walker is hitting 3s, and most importantly y'all got rid of Bryn Forbes. God he blew."
Even our losses this year are actually competitive and not us trying to stay in a game with Marco Belinelli and Bryn Forbes. I hate moral victories but going toe to toe with the reigning champs is an improvement for us.
"Just for reference checked BR for O/D rtg going from February onwards. Not the best stat to use in a vacuum, but hardly any defensive stats are. Anyway, while he‚Äôs not anywhere near a good defender, the defensive iq is there, just like it was with the Spurs(judging from the games I saw these past 2 weeks).  The only thing that he really should do a better job of is - not helping off the corner 3 as much. I get it, since that was the defensive scheme in San Antonio all the years he was there(because he had to play together with Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli, two guys who were the epitomy of revolving doors on defense - anyone could drive past them and Davis often helped off of his man. The two previously mentioned players also regularly missed their switch on defense, it was quite a disaster actually. Old Tony and ageing Patty was more of the same. Helping in the paint was also very necessary last year on the Wizards, with Isiah ‚Äòguarding‚Äô up top. But this year it has been too much, especially while he was still not in game shape."
Bryn Forbes
"Yeah, he's not great. But again, he's like our 8th best player. Marc Gasol, Bryn Forbes, Aron Baynes. That's the kinda guys who y'all need to be comparing him to."
"Those players are often the ones that need to get back the most. The player guarding them will likely play help or be grabbing the rebound, so further off the baseline or at least closer to the middle  But yeah, it just depends on the personal. Divincenzo goes into the middle and then back, but Bryn Forbes doesn't"
Spurs biggest improvement over their last few years is their defense. Their offense has always been good (I'd say really good) but my god having Bryn Forbes and Bellinneli playing big minutes for them was just awful to see (sometimes at the same time!). Switch-ability is the name of the game and they're really building towards that. We'll see how their long boi Samanic pans out.
Get my boy Bryn Forbes in there.
Rondo and bryn forbes
"It's a win trade considering the situation. Pop wasn't gonna give the Lakers another Superstar, and again, their offer for Kawhi at the time wasn't close to his value, specially after looking what they sent for AD. The best value of the trade was BI. Lonzo doesn't do much for us. We have enough guards. Josh Hart really isn't as valuable either.  &gt; Ingram at 21  Would have been nice, but Derozan has done his job as the first offensive option. The sole reason we struggled so much last year was having two of the worst defenders in the entire league taking so many minutes alongside Derozan, and we had lost DJ for a season. Plus, Ingram isn't a stud on defense as well. Derozan's job is offense and to facilitate, and he does that well. His defense struggle can be hidden by playing him as a Forward while he's alongside good defensive players. He has bought into the team, and it's also an awesome presence for our young unit. Derozan has saved us many games. He's far from perfect, but he isn't the main issue with our team.   &gt;Lonzo/1st round pick   Why have Lonzo when we have Derrick White and Dejounte? We got a first round pick from Toronto that turned into Big Body, and Jak fills that very much needed defensive anchor as Lamarcus has regressed a lot.  &gt; While giving away D Green  Danny was sent to match salary, and the dude was coming off a bad year. So you can very well say it was Danny for Jakob and Keldon, and both have turned out incredibly well. May not have been that good because we gave up our perimeter defense, but seeing how the team is with Keldon and Jakob, I'd say it was worth it in hindsight.  &gt;  Just doesn‚Äôt make any sense at the time and now  It made sense at the time. Kawhi tanked his value, and with the mystery surrounding his injury, no team was gonna give anything for a year rental. Lakers offered, but for a player like Kawhi, and them being conference rivals, it wasn't worth it. No matter what the team would have done, we would have been clowned, either for not falling for the ""godsend"" offer, or because we gifted the Lakers a free superteam In both situations, we were getting fleeced. People talk about how we could have gotten an AD-like haul or a PG-like, but that type of deal was never offered in the first place for us. Toronto was the team with the best offer, since Pop really wasn't gonna spend his last years in a rebuild, so we took that one. Toronto made the gamble with Kawhi and it paid off. We did made the playoffs with Derozan on his first year, and pushed the second seed Nuggets to 7, but last year we went to shit thanks to Marco and Bryn Forbes playing so goddam much. This season we are in a much better position for now. We were expected to be under 30 games for the season."
Bryn Forbes
"The same could be said about Curry then, right? Saying he's a 42% 3pt shooter discredits him quite a lot. His 42% isn't the same as Seth Curry's 45%, Rozier's 45%, Bryn Forbes' 46%. And its not just because of volume."
Bryn Forbes is working so damn hard to give Thanasis an assist
Bryn Forbes is either scorching hot or brick city. No in betweens
Bryn Forbes? More like please stop this is a stupid amount of three pointers.
THT is nice.   Sidenote: Is Bertans a 6‚Äô10 Bryn Forbes?
"lol that's not true at all. Bryn Forbes was public enemy \#1 last season in /r/NBASpurs and almost everyone hated him and blamed him for us missing the Playoffs.  you still have bitter dudes making posts about him when he has a shit game for the Bucks like ""lol thank fuck we got rid of this guy"""
"I am happy with a win, and how the two stars performed, but unhappy with how Brolo‚Äôs game went. For a center on center matchup, I would‚Äôve said Brook won, but after last nights game that is arguable. He couldn‚Äôt do anything, didn‚Äôt really get into the paint, he was alright on defense but I take into account that Fox likes to drive and how is fox gonna successfully drive on Giannis and Brook. Overall disappointing from him, most of the team though, very positive, players are trying harder on defense and that‚Äôs what we need. These last two games have been big for us, even if it‚Äôs against ‚Äòbad teams‚Äô a win is a win. Hopefully we can keep our momentum and Jrue can help us out again.  I‚Äôm curious if we move Jrue to SG, and have DJ start at point. Have Donte come off the bench. When we start DJA it helps alleviate some of his weaknesses rather than having him and Bryn Forbes come off the bench. Defensively it would be better too, Donte is a better defender then DJA maybe him and Bryn do better together with Portis on the bench mob. Probably not but it seems like a good thought in theory."
Tbh I feel like Bryn Forbes was pretty dam hated last season for his defense last season. Him and Marco were some of if not the worst defenders in the league. We played incredibly well in the bubble without them as well.
"They're so defensive about shitty players on that sub. I got downvoted all the time for my ""Bryn Forbes is costing us games with his terrible defense"" complaint the last two seasons.   You know how people from California keep moving to Texas? I swear, it's like the NBA version of that...they're just like Laker fans talking up shitty players!"
"&gt;because they've been playing DJ Augustin more and he's literally one of the worst defensive players I've ever watched.  They also play Bryn Forbes, who isn't a good defender either."
Bryn Forbes is shooting 47% from three
"Bryn Forbes is not a good player, he's all we have so that's why he plays"
"BRYN ""TALCUM BROGDON"" FORBES"
"It's more than *there's no Bryn Forbes*. This team is so much more fun to watch, because we can hold leads consistently compared to the shit show that was last year."
And more importantly the replacement is Bryn Forbes.  If we at least had a George Hill...  Augustin looks terrible. We need to do something about our backup Point Guard situation.  Here comes Austin Rivers?
if they get a first round pick for Bryn Forbes then horst needs to automatically get into the HOF. forbes might be unplayable in the playoffs
I like Bryn Forbes a lot and I feel like we could get him relatively cheap.
"Yeah, it‚Äôs crazy how DeMar and LMA were the scapegoats last season despite Bryn Forbes being the obvious problem. Ever since Bryn‚Äôs departure the Spurs have had a top 10 defense and since LMA has been injured their top 10 offense has been a bottom 10. It seems that majority of Spurs fans don‚Äôt truly understand where the problem is and just like to pretend like they do."
"defense  not having Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli on the floor is already a huge improvement by itself. LMA is still killing us but he has been out lately and we have been playing much better as a result.   in addition, the young guys stepped up. Dejounte is finally completely healthy again and it shows. Keldon is playing well, Vassell is doing really well for a rookie, Lonnie also improved a bit. and with Marco/Bryn gone, they all actually get playing time"
"not having bryn forbes and belinelli, less lma. improved dejounte, emergence of keldon  much improved defense thanks to better lineups basically"
"Because last year we had Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli, arguably the two worst defenders in the league playing a lot of minutes. In the bubble, both of them were out, hence why we were one three pointer away from the playoffs again. Now we added defense with KJ playing a bigger role on top of Devin Vassel, who's a 3 n D type of player."
"I'm so happy Bryn Forbes found a nice role on the Bucks, seems like a nice fit on there!"
"I‚Äôm the Bryn Forbes of pick ups. A good but streaky shooter who can be one of the better offensive players on the pitch every other week.  But i‚Äôm also weak, short, horrible defensively, can only dribble and pass little, so really not doing much to help the team unless my shot is falling."
"You have to make your adjustments midgame if someone pops off from beyond.  In Suns vs Bucks on Wednesday, Bryn Forbes was 5 of 6 from three by halftime. The Bucks themselves were shooting 55% from beyond the arc. Suns adjusted, and Bucks ended up only shooting 43% for the game. Forbes never hit another three the rest of the game."
"He's definitely not the sixth-to-worst defender in the league, which he would be by this metric.  He's prone to young mistakes and can be overaggressive, but he's a hell of a lot better than defensive stalwarts ahead of him (including the likes of Lou Will, Bryn Forbes, and James Harden).  I wouldn't go as far to say that he's an awful defender most of the time.  He leads the team in rebounding, gets to the line at a high clip, finishes well, moves the ball, and has popped off for numerous 20+ point games this year.  He's had a rough February shooting, but he was around 34% for December and January, so I'll consider it a slump.  Him being one of the worst 20 players in the league is pretty laughable."
"Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes"
Bryn Forbes is a cheat code
BRYN FUCKING FORBES YALL
cant be worse than bryn forbes defensively and he offers more in half court offense than pat and craig..I just hope bud doesnt Christian wood or sterling brown him.
"&gt; He's still developing but is a solid contributor.  No, this is the problem...he's not.   He's a bad NBA player and he's not getting better.  This is like last year when I was on the ""Bryn Forbes is terrible"" train and nobody would fucking agree.   Just because somebody wears our jersey doesn't mean he's good and we have to talk ourselves into him.   You watch a guy like Tyrese Haliburton or SGA and it's just immediately clear that they understand the game of basketball and can play above-average minutes in this league.   We know what guys who start out like this look like long-term.  Here is 538's player projection for Lonnie...  Notice the WAR value they projected for this year? So far, his actual WAR is -1.1   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/lonnie-walker-iv/  In reality, if this level of play continues, he's more similar to Emmanuel Mudiay or Dennis Smith Jr or Ish Smith.  The track record of guys who play this poorly in year three is bad."
last season the Spurs were starting and playing Bryn fucking Forbes for 30 minutes a game. not every player that starts should start. idk how you guys don't see the difference between an ish smith type of player and a Ricky Rubio type of player.
"sadly, Aldridge is becoming the new bryn forbes this season for the spurs. his defense is so much worse this year probably just due to age and his value now depends on him hitting shots. poeltl needs to really step up offensively to force pop's hand"
Bryn forbes idk why but to me he seems stuck up and I don‚Äôt like his attitude/expressions
we finally got our Bryn Forbes stopper üòé
Can‚Äôt attract free agents? You mean like Bobby Portis? Bryn Forbes? Guys who are 4th and 7th in NBA 3PT%?
Splash bros. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes
"Eh, Donte's not as good as him now (and certainly might not ever be, though he's got potential and looks like he's improving year-to-year), but that was always looking like a questionable trade given the money Bogdan was going to command.  Main reason we were so pissed at it falling through was because we thought that could end up hurting our chances of getting Giannis to re-sign (especially with the media majorly exaggerating the closeness of the Bogdan-Giannis friendship).  Bogdan's contract wouldn't have had huge implications for our immediate roster, but it would mean we probably don't sign at least one if not two of Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, or D.J. Augustin (the choice of who not to sign there seems rather obvious now, but who knows what choice the Bucks would have made, since D.J. filled a hole on the roster while Bryn was more of a bonus depth piece.)  But it also would have pushed us way more over the luxury tax than we currently are, and with us not having so many draft picks in the immediate future, not really any easy paths to improving the team at all.  I mean, we're still *kind of* in that situation, but the Bogdan contract would have definitely made us even less flexible there."
"So this is the old Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson defense. Just like last year it was the LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes defense. The its not me its them defense.   I'd like to think Spurs fans are smart enough to figure out the common denominator here but perhaps I give too much credit."
"I think the reason why Derozan has had the opportunity to showcase and develop his passing ability with the Spurs was because of the massive amount of injuries to their PG rotation during the beginning of the 2018-2019 season.  During that season Dejounte Murray was out with an ACL injury, and Derrick White was out with a foot injury.  That forced the Spurs to start the undrafted Bryn Forbes as their ""point guard"" alongside Derozan.  During that time the Spurs had no legitimate point guard, so Derozan took the PG responsibility and performed admirably.   Even Pop himself stated that he had no idea Derozan was that good of a passer until then.   So overall it's a complex situation of Derozan proving himself able to shoulder the playmaking responsibility and the Spurs starting to use that skill of his."
Brutal. I wanted to post a spicy Bryn Forbes meme
"Damn, the Bucks have Bryn Forbes? So many shooters"
Bryn Forbes w/ a 3. Lakers took TO...
Since when does Bryn Forbes write
"Cp3, Bryn Forbes, LeBron, Giannis, Jokic"
"He actually played well for us in the playoffs 2019, we called game 7 the Bryn Forbes game too"
"Per 538 Trae is the 6th worst defender. It goes Anfernee Simon's, Bryn Forbes, Dame, Lonnie Walker, Eric Gordon, then Trae"
tank commander bryn forbes
Anyone else catch Bryn Forbes torpedoing that Knicks player?
"Bryn Forbes (killed us last game *badly*), Thanasis Antetokounmpo (former Knick), Brook Lopez (former crosstown rival when he was w/ the Nets), Sam Merill,  Jordan Nwora, Axel Toupane, Mamadi Diakite, and someone else I might not know"
"His shooting touch is still there, for sure. But having him on the floor was like having a 7ft tall Bryn Forbes out there."
"My guess:   Sam Merrill-Bryn Forbes-Pat Connaughton-Thanasis-Brook Lopez as the starters  Axel Toupane - Jordan Nwora -Mamadi Diakite as the bench.  Eight man rotation, Bucks have two open roster spots in addition to all these players being out, so lots of minutes for everyone there."
no he just talks about how curry is a system player and how he is basically lucky bryn forbes
'Bryn Forbes' is an anagram of 'Steph Curry'. Coincidence? Unlikely.
"honestly this year it's Lonnie and LaMarcus. LMA is straight up bad this year and Lonnie is the tantalizing hyper athletic shooter who shows potential but makes one headed plays all the time. last year it was Bryn Forbes and Belinelli, so with them both gone, I guess the fanbase has felt like Lonnie is the one whos the scapegoat."
"Korver waa definitely not better for the Bucks as a shooter than Bryn has been this season, in any way whatsoever. It's not even a discussion worth having.   Middleton is obviously much bettee than Bryn so I'm not sure where he really got this but Forbes has certainly been lighting it up from 3."
all this bryn forbes loves made me happy
Bryn Forbes
This game shows that if Bryn Forbes misses a 3 it is because he has chosen to do so in the interest of fairness to the other team.
Bryn Forbes 7/7 from 3 üëÄ
"Bryn Forbes just misses when he wants to, I guess."
"He‚Äôs our play maker, and he‚Äôs not bryn Forbes on defense."
Welcome to the Bryn Forbes curse... (half jk)
Ah I see y‚Äôall are learning about Bryn forbes!
Favourite player is Kyrie. But i play like Bryn Forbes.
"Opened the season with an injury so he never got those early games then when competing for minutes he underperformed. I think it's just a team fit issue because he's clearly found himself with you. We've unlocked Bryn Forbes, Bobby Portis and Jeff Teague so I don't think it's just a Bud thing."
Is it bryn Forbes?
I added Bryn Forbes over him two days ago. Fuck me.
Bryn Forbes does this but it‚Äôs usually wet
"I think the most underrated player depends on how you get your sports news and updates.   Zion seems to be flying under the radar this year despite being a Top 10 scorer, similarly to Zach Lavine and Kyrie Irving.  I also don't hear much about Mitchell, Fox, or Sexton.   Marcus Morris, Bryn Forbes, and Michael Porter Jr. have all been lights out from three this year."
You mean Bryn forbes
Bryn ‚ÄúJoe Harris‚Äù Forbes
I've never seen a shooter get hit on more 3s without a call than Bryn Forbes.
Bryn Forbes has been good
"We've lost to some terrible teams this year, we live and die by the 2nd units 3 point shooting. If Bryn Forbes would have missed just one more shot, which you know in the playoffs he will, then this game is not a win."
"""Bryn Forbes"" ü§¨"
Jrue jacking up 3s like he's Bryn Forbes smh
Bryn Forbes and Shamet is the spiderman pointing meme for these 2 teams
Let's go Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes' Splits yesterday: 30/0/0  Bryn Forbes' Splits tonight: 10/13/1   He's just playing with us.
how tf you let them get giannis antetokounmpo and bryn forbes
bryn forbes is a certified rocket killer  fr tho what is it bout the spurs and mavs that makes anyone who ever plays for them straight kill us anytime we play against them? so many former players for both teams still go off against us every time
"Not really, NBA is really hard to watch right now because of it for casual fans.   I went to a Bucks game and the entire starting lineup was out. The Bucks starting lineup was Jordan Nwora, Jeff Teague, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Bryn Forbes, and Bobby Portis.   Now, I go to a lot of Bucks games so I didn't really care, but what if that was someones first and only chance to go to a Bucks game this season. They should have someone standing at the door with a voucher for a free game or discount to another game or to the merch shop when that type of thing happens. People aren't paying $100 a ticket to see Thanasis Antetokounmpo."
Bryn Forbes claims 2027
"Nice list, pretty much agree other than maybe swapping the 76ers and the Bucks. I really do rate Jrue's addition that highly, significant upgrade on Bledsoe. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes have been really nice pick ups too and I expect PJ Tucker to come in handy. Plenty of shooters around Giannis for when teams build the wall, just have to knock the open looks down."
Bryn Forbes has been a pretty decent defender this season honestly.
Bryn Forbes ?
Bryn Forbes
Bryn forbes the decent defender.
"Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis has negative +/-, so I guess that‚Äôs something unexpected"
Bryn Forbes.
Steph  MJ  Bryn Forbes  KD  Hakeem
that‚Äôs what happens when you have Bryn Forbes and Khris Middleton as your wing defenders
"Bobby Portis, khris Middleton, jordan Nwora, sam merrill, bryn forbes are all shooting over 42% from deep... Jrue is right at 40%. Pat and Donte are both around 38%. We got some good shooters this year"
Plus Bryn Forbes obviously isn't 100% so the Bucks are actually worse off.
"&gt;There are players that we know to lead teams very well. Jimmy, Chris Paul, and LeBron are good examples.  Sure, but just because we know some guys can lead teams well doesn't mean we can objectively compare how good leaders they are.   &gt;Tatum has the deep playoff runs but he didn't do them as the leader of his team. He was a rookie for his first one, and his team entirely lacked lategame execution in the other, if we're looking at his two ECF berths, just because you're a team's best player doesnt mean you're leading the team  Just because he was a rookie in the first one doesn't mean he wasn't a leader on that team. He was the go-to guy when they needed a bucket and just as important to that run as Horford, Brown, Smart, and Terry. The second deep run did lack late-game execution, so that is a valid point.  &gt;Jimmy was the Heat's best player through 3 of the 4 series, with Bam being our best player due to the matchup with the Celtics. Jimmy was the one hitting the clutch shots down the stretch in Milwaukee, he set the tone of the game in Indiana, and obviously with the finals. I watched every game of our playoff run, Dragic was an amazing scorer for us but he wasn't our best player for any of our series'.  Dragic had better stats in that first series and you can make a really good argument he was better than Jimmy in that series, even if you do want to lean Jimmy. In comparison with Tatum, there isn't a single series last playoffs when he wasn't the best player.  &gt;Id argue that Monty Williams spearheaded the turnaround in the bubble, and Chris Paul completed it this year.  Monty for sure played a big part in it and CP3 did too, but Booker was just as much a part of that as they were and if that isn't evident to you from how Book has played all year and especially in the playoffs, I don't know what to tell you.  &gt;Boston's problem is on court leadership. I've watched more Celtics games this season than any team but the Heat and Lakers, and you guys fall apart at the end of games. That shows the lack of a steadying presence from a leader.  So Tatum actually led the league in 4th quarter scoring on 48/48/88 splits and continued that trend in the playoffs on 45/50/87 splits. Late game execution was a problem for last year's Celtics but it was not nearly as much of an issue this year. The problem was more so slow starts and having to play from behind all game long.   You're basing your argument on leadership too much around how you feel, and while it is perfectly fine to feel like Jimmy Butler is an excellent leader, you cannot use that as an objective, unbiased argument.   If we were playing by those rules, I would tell you that in my opinion, an objectively good leader wouldn't get outscored by Bryn Forbes in the process of being swept in the first round by a team that they had beaten less than a year ago and is currently being exposed to have no legitimate offensive system, especially after talking a big deal about being able to take over and carry once the playoffs come around. Good leaders don't objectively do that, do they?"
"Yeah the fact that you cant go to a 2 time MVP in the clutch because he cant make free throws, has an horrendous shot selection, and is a risk of taking a charge because his off the dribble game hasnt imrpoved one bit isnt a problem. The fact that his efficiency fell apart again in the crucial playoff series isnt a problem. The fact that the DPOY hides on role players again because he cant handle KD isnt a problem. Lets blame Bryn Forbes instead"
we were living through bryn forbes üò¢
"Joe Harris is just a poor man's Bryn Forbes, dude is honestly like 13th man on the bench material."
Did bryn forbes strip durant?
Bryn Forbes defensive stopper
Kinda like what Forbes used to do for us at the beginning of the season. Read we used to call him Bryn ‚Äúyou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù Forbes. Then he learned.
Bryn Forbes the brick wall
Imagine if KD had real talent like Bryn Forbes on his team
i want another Bryn Forbes night pls
Bryn Forbes just heaves shots and they go in somehow
Imagine thinking Durant is better than Bryn Forbes
"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt shoot the three‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know, but he can‚Äù  Bryn Forbes bursts into view"
Bryn Forbes
BRYN FORBES
It's Elijah Bryant's legacy time here. Bryn Forbes is just a pawn in the narrative. :/
Is Bryn Forbes‚Äô legacy on the line tonight?  Up next on First Take
"He averages 16 points in 29 minutes, and would be a great spacer without being so much of a defensive liability as Bryn Forbes and would provide even more shot creation which the bucks need with giannas being trash in the late game offensively"
"&gt;Is Bryn Forbes really THAT bad on defense  yes, he is, talking by experience lmao."
So he's Bryn Forbes and that's who is supposed to help win the series?
"What if *that* is who you are though?  I know, I know, in the relaxed environment of the regular season Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are 3pt gods. But are they really?  In all Bud's teams shooting would go up in the regular season making you think that he does make the team(s) shoot better (through his system or whatever), but without fail they would return back to earth come playoff time.  Maybe what you see *now* is the truer ability of your players. Maybe you are not a 38% shooting team (or however high it was in the regular season( but rather a 33% team). I.e. most of your shooters are not that good, because they only shoot well in a relaxed environment.  What I love about Euroleague is that teams really try in their ""regular season"". Yeah players (and teams) are one tier down than even the average NBA team/player, however what you see (there) is what you get. You pretty much have an idea of which team(s) will perform and which won't. In the NBA things are different , the long season makes it impossible to gauge the true capabilities of a team.  For example the Nets were a bad defensive team and suddenly as it turns out they are pretty good, *because* they were saving themselves for the playoffs (for all the good that did to them). Similarly , what if your team never turns it up from 3 because you were never that good at it, not really?"
Thanasis with the slam! Now they're saying it's a Bryn Forbes three.
"Bucks probably aren't going to get better than this for a little while. Outside of trades, here's the ground that can be gained;  * A second-round pick/undrafted player develops into a 6-8 off the bench level player * Donte is young coming into his fourth year so could develop * Giannis is still only 26, so still has room to get better  Ground that can be lost;  * Our first-choice, slow moving centre will turn 34 next year * PJ Tucker is a UFA, and also will turn 37 * Bobby Portis can turn down his player option of $3.5~ million (he is worth much more than this) * Bryn Forbes can turn down his player option of $2.5~ million (he outplaying his contract)  There might be other stuff, but we'd need things to really fall our way to improve the roster. *If* Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis take their player option (not impossible, imo) then they're both young and have improved in a big way this year so that could be a factor."
I‚Äôm not sure I know what you are talking about sir. I distinctly remember Bryn ‚ÄúSteph Curry‚Äù Forbes going wild every game.
Bryn Forbes shoots like he‚Äôs never going to get the ball again lol
Bryn Forbes the GOAT
"Bryn Forbes needs all the PT, he‚Äôs such a threat and we need spacing"
That spacing was absolutely fucked bryn Forbes was just lingering behind the 3 point line in every bodies way
Bryn Forbes bro what are you doing
"Look at any other metric and they will say the exact same thing, Bryn Forbes is awful on defense."
You know you‚Äôve lost the plot when you start pointing to Bryn Forbes getting hot for a couple of games.   He wasn‚Äôt going to keep shooting 50% from three.
"Middleton played horrible for 2 games, holiday has been inefficient, giannis has been inconsistent offensively and taking dumb shots, bryn forbes and the role players decided to quit. Less about the Nets defense IMO"
Yeah Bryn Forbes was not catching wide open looks from 3 and nailing them on the back of ball movement. Whatever you say bro.
Bryn Forbes is a shooting guard and... a really bad one because of his awful defense.  Literally 110 out of 116 graded by ESPN.  http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/page/3/sort/DRPM/position/2
"&gt;I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not ‚Äúcheap‚Äù  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn‚Äôt the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn‚Äôt he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren‚Äôt cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren‚Äôt exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don‚Äôt have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don‚Äôt have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don‚Äôt trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don‚Äôt know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I‚Äôll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there‚Äôs a high chance of us bringing back. So you‚Äôre talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that‚Äôs 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you‚Äôre in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that‚Äôs fine.   Now I don‚Äôt even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we‚Äôre talking about the Lakers."
Bryn Forbes and Marco belinelli could give anyone a run for their money
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I‚Äôm gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
"I don't expect us to win another game, but it is possible our shooting rebounds some and we have a game where we are white hot. Bryn Forbes is shooting 23% right now. If we get hot enough we can win a game, but unless that's Game 4, we're done for."
12% is very unlikely. 3.1% is significantly more unlikely than *that*. You're the goofy mf who tried to argue that Joe Harris and Bryn Forbes having poor shooting nights is somehow equivalent. It's clearly more rare for Harris to shoot this badly than for Forbes.  Also lmfao hold up you want me to check on the low chances for the Bucks to shoot badly because you think it *helps* your point  Do you see the roster of the other team? Are you aware of who you're playing against? Like the Bucks are a good shooting team that had a poor shooting night but that's Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie Irving out there. You think it's more likely for them to shoot this badly? Okay buddy
"You aren‚Äôt reading what I‚Äôm writing clearly   Bryn Forbes+Connaughton+Portis 40 minutes, 6 points   Is it unreasonable to ask them to put 15 up?   Is it unreasonable to Lopez and Tucker to combine for 20 points? Jrue Holiday to score more than 9?"
Bryn Forbes isn't supposed to miss his shots either
Bryn Forbes was Steph for a few minutes
Bryn Forbes looking like Bin Forge
The Heat made Bryn forbes look like Steph Curry
"Bryn Forbes has never not shot the ball if they call a play for him, like ever."
Bryn Forbes looks like the main character in that musical that keeps advertising
You know you‚Äôre bad when you can‚Äôt take bryn Forbes iso
Bryn forbes channeling his inner tyler herro
"Lol bryn Forbes d, shamet is making Forbes his bitch this series"
Bryn Forbes hasn‚Äôt even checked in yet
oh shit Bryn Forbes is about to torch us now isn‚Äôt he
"He‚Äôs saying that even if you have an elite defender on a guy that‚Äôs elite offensively, he‚Äôs still gonna give you 30, the only difference is you gotta make them work for that 30. He‚Äôs not saying putting Giannis on KD is the same as putting Bryn Forbes on him"
"Some key points touched on in the video:   Brooklyn after switching all year is now playing drop coverage even with switchable defenders like claxton and Durant. Reason why is likely the lack of respect for jrue mid range jumper and Giannis has no pick and pop threat.    Brooklyn is attacking brook Lopez in the drop coverage every possession. Durant and kyrie shoot 50% from mid range and can either hit the jumper or when help comes off shooters Durant has been finding guys for threes.    Brooklyn is predictably roasting Bryn Forbes by attacking their hedge and recover strategy by hitting Forbes with another screen off the recovery by a third guy, example given is by claxton. Also shamet/Harris are slipping screen at the peak of the hedge timing it perfectly for open shots.   Overall the nets defensively are playing shooters effectively. The only one they are giving proper respect to are Forbes and middleton to a lesser extent. Jrue and brook are being played off of to give help when necessary.   Durant attacks each defender in different ways. Against Giannis he is consistently isoing him and going back and forth to attack his foot speed laterally. Against jrue he has gone into the post to avoid his dribble being contested and then shooting over or hitting with counter post moves. Against tucker he puts him into the pick and roll, tucker has not been great getting over screens and they‚Äôre attack him in this area.   It appears the nets coaching staff pushed literally every right button this game and had a counter to every strategy the bucks threw at them. When they went to the zone it did slow the nets down temporarily but the nash counter was Bruce brown playing the center of the floor where he thrives with his floater and kicking to shooters."
On an individual basis basically every bucks player is better than their nuggets counterpart except for maybe milsap  Bryn Forbes is the only one remotely as terrible as facu or MPJ
Luke ‚ÄúBryn Forbes‚Äù Kennard
"Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes as your 4th, 5th, and 6th best players is absolutely horrendous outside of Lopez. Forbes has struggled to stay on an NBA roster for years and now he gets big minutes for the Bucks lol.    Nets are pretty deep. Griffin and Harris are really good role players. Brown, Shamet, and Claxton are solid too.   Not even compatible, stop making a fool of yourself lol"
Does it really matter what they were. With us Portis is a really good 6th man and Bryn Forbes is a great shooter. Both probably getting paid in the off season.  Cameron Payne was playing like a 12th man and now he's a productive backup pg on the Suns.
Yeah Giannis has been incredible it‚Äôs just that the Nets as a whole are feasting on the Bucks drop coverage and are trying to involve Bryn Forbes in as many actions on defense as possible.
"Lol yes i'm serious but you're entitled to your own opinion.  Durant &gt;&gt; Giannis  Kyrie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Middleton  Sure, Jrue Holiday is &gt;&gt; Joe harris but the gap between the top two nets versus top two bucks is huge.  I'd also argue shammet, mike james, claxton are equal role players/bench to bryn forbes, bobby portis (LOL), and pat connaughton..."
"Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes"
I mean... Bryn Forbes has been living in my head rent free after that 1st round performance he had against us...
Yeah and it certainly helps to get clean looks in almost any action involving Brook Lopez. I love Brook but if the Bucks continue to play drop coverage with their bigs all series it won‚Äôt be a long series. Also pulling out a 2-3 zone with Bryn Forbes might be a strategy you keep in the locker room especially against the Nets shooters.
Why is Terrence Howard playing for the Bucks and calling himself Bryn Forbes?
They lost George hill and Eric bledsoe. And replaced them with Bobby portis and Bryn Forbes and PJ Tucker
Bryn Forbes looks like Terrence Howard light
"This Nets team always know what to do on offense. Attacking Bryn Forbes with screens, attacking Lopez and Portis with pullups against the drop. They always have a goal. Its a testament to the coaching of Nash and D'antoni. Bucks could use some of that direction."
Someone get Bryn Forbes and Jrue some help fml
"This game is literally Bryn Forbes vs the Nets and it's shockingly going nowhere, I'm gonna go into a self induced coma if Giannis shoots one more jump shot"
 Bruce Brown&gt;Bryn Forbes&gt;Jimmy Butler
Get Bryn Forbes some help
Ok *Bryn* *Forbes*
Does bryn forbes have lipstick on?
Bryn Forbes is good as hell
We just ran out a lineup of Jrue/Bryn Forbes/Pat Connaughton/Khris/Bobby Portis while both Kyrie and KD were still in the game
Trade Giannis and Middleton for picks and build around Bryn Forbes
"I know I‚Äôm forgetting guys from further back, but off the top of my head Bryn Forbes, Bertans, Danny Green, and Cory Joseph come to mind. Jonathan Simmons was a really cool story. I know Spurs were the first to bring Boban to the league from Europe. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray don‚Äôt fit the criteria but as far as development goes they seem to be on a good trajectory so far. And in addition to Manu I do think TP and Kawhi are major scouting and development success stories.  I think the main thing is that they haven‚Äôt had a lottery pick in a long time, but stayed dominant by scouting and forming high-caliber role players and even stars. I‚Äôm not sure that Manu, TP, and Kawhi get to be among the very best players in the league if not for playing with the Spurs."
"You would be surprised. I ran the numbers for the 4 best spot up shooters I could think of Seth Curry, Joe Harris, Marcus Morris and Bryn Forbes and none of them shoot better than 2.37 percent better at home than away."
Starting five all average   Bryn forbes  Lonnie Walker  James ennis  Mike Scott  Alex Len
"Christ, everyone who plays in San Antonio isn't a system player getting propped up by Pop. The only thing that changed in DeMar's game in San Antonio is him improving his playmaking and shooting slightly less. Why would that not carryover to a new team?  And this narrative that players in San Antonio leaving and getting exposed elsewhere hasn't been true for a while. Kawhi, Danny Green, Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, and Davis Bertans have all had success since leaving in the past few years. Take Pop off this pedestal."
Bryn Forbes can pull up from 3 anytime and anywhere as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Teague though shouldn‚Äôt have even seen the floor.
Tbf they did lose DiVincenzo so they‚Äôre short one guard in the rotation. And Bryn Forbes is basically unplayable in the 4th cause of his Efense (No D to be found)
"My money is on Bryn ""The Forbes List"" Forbes"
"The series against us was a combination of the Heat sucking and being completely out of gas and the Bucks catching fire, Bryn Forbes turned into Steph Curry from 3 and averaged like 20 ppg. The percentages were always gonna normalize, they won‚Äôt shoot this poorly again most likely.  Their downfall this postseason, if they do lose, will be because of Budenholzer though. His rotations are terrible and there‚Äôs no excuse to play Giannis 35 minutes in a very winnable game. Jrue is a huge improvement but Bud is definitely holding the team back from its full potential."
Jokes on both of you it‚Äôll 100% be Bryn Forbes
"We‚Äôre not. There‚Äôs like three guys on our bench I‚Äôm comfortable actually playing, and even then Bryn Forbes is pretty situational in this matchup."
"Joe Harris is actually good. Blake Griffin is washed but still ok. Shamet is alright. Bruce Brown is decent. Claxton isn't bad. That they get to play with Kyrie, Durant, and Harden amplifies their abilities a bunch. Not to mention Jeff Green who's day-to-day.  Mike James, Tyler Johnson, Luwawu-Cabarrot can all give you minutes and not get picked on or have to force dumb shit to make an impact. Their depth is actually completely ridiculous. Dinwiddie being out doesn't even seem to matter.  Meanwhile Bryn Forbes is playing 20 plus minutes. Yikes."
"Some of them were just stupid shots too. There's no reason for Giannis, Bryn Forbes and Jeff Teague to be taking pull-up 3s in transition, especially since Forbes had already missed a few shots at that point."
gotta appreciate Bryn Forbes timing
Remember when Bryn Forbes was briefly the greatest shooter in playoff history?
"Lmao you know Heat fans gotta be so mad, this team looked dangerous like a week ago, and now Bryn Forbes out here just running cardio, Bucks embarrassing"
Bryn Forbes said ‚úåüèª
What's the value of Bryn Forbes today
PJ and Bryn Forbes. Giannis and Khris are the all stars.
I really hope the extended time off didn‚Äôt cool off gas phase Bryn Forbes into an unsightly liquid form
The Bryn forbes experience
Why did Bryn Forbes blow his 3PT load on Miami
Spurs fans tried to tell y‚Äôall about Bryn Forbes. When he‚Äôs on you love him; when he‚Äôs missing shots he is the biggest negative imaginable
"yeah bryn forbes doubling blake, smart tactics"
The Bryn Forbes experience.
Ok but now i wanna see Chris Paul breaking Bryn Forbes ankles and stepping over him
"Davis Bertans was the worst defender on a team that had Bryn Forbes and Marco Belinelli. I‚Äôm a bit naive as I didn‚Äôt watch a lot of Portland this past year, but I can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôd be a solution for their problems"
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
what we had 48 wins in our first year with bryn fucking forbes as our starting shooting guard.   we went away from shooting in our second and thrid year but 100 percent if we decided to stick with that first year but tinker shit around we would of been a solid team
"Everyone shits on Bud for this, but what are his options? Play Holiday 48 minutes, bring in a non ball handler in Bryn Forbes or?????"
"You mean like losing your starting point guard in game 3 of the first round and having Bryn Forbes or Jeff Fucking Teague as your backups? Yeah that totally has 0 impact on anything, you got me there bro."
"I strongly disagree that he was hidden in the regular season. During the regular season, it was a hobby of mine to key in on Bryn Forbes on most defensive possessions that he was in the game. The frequency that he let someone blow by him on a cut for an open layup, his inability/unwillingness to fight over screens, his inability to contest shots, and his lack of resistance when ‚Äúhelping‚Äù made for an extremely negative defensive impact. He did get blown by on switches at times, but his 1 on 1 defense was solid when defending forwards, slower guards, and non-shooters. In the Heat series, the Heat tried to target Bryn and put him on Jimmy Butler, but that was the perfect matchup for Bryn because he could give Jimmy a cushion and body him up with his stocky frame. That was the only period in the season where Bryn was a positive defender. In the regular season, he was terrible defensively. Advanced stats and lineup data agree."
"I‚Äôm a Heat fan, and this is what facing the Bucks is like.  Sometimes they just look so incompetent. Holiday and Middleton are a combined 6/24 from the field, and Giannis‚Äô is forcing jumpshot after jumpshot and as usual, bricking them all.  Next game as the 3rd quarter winds down they‚Äôve made 20 3s and you‚Äôre suddenly down 15. You know it‚Äôs over when Bryn Forbes comes out and starts torching you too."
when is bryn forbes fine ass getting minutes
Bryn Forbes isn't better than Jeff Teague?
"Bud, why is Bryn Forbes being benched in favor of old ass Jeff Teague?"
Suns have a run after Teague subbed in. Bryn Forbes  is better.
Bryn Forbes must be unplayable if Teague is getting so many minutes.
Is Bryn Forbes really worse than Jeff Teague rn?
The idea that Jeff Teague is better than Bryn Forbes is wild to me.
That's nothing. The Bucks had a 4 on 1 earlier this postseason that ended with a Bryn Forbes 3-point attempt.
"Lol, if it was anybody but Bryn Forbes - DNP-CD I would probably be really annoyed."
Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis were top 10 during the regular season
Who cares about those guys. Bryn Forbes needs a ring.
You have bryn Forbes as your flair so I can see you‚Äôre just a masochist
The wall defense let 2 other people open from three. The right play against it is to pass the ball to the open teammates unless you are one of the top shooters of the league. That defensive strat is completely losing long-term if  the open guys make their shots at a reasonable rate.  The heat lost this year because they let Bryn Forbes. Pat and Portis kill them from three in order to stop giannis and tbf they did limit him. The thing is if your teammates shit the bed and you lost confidence in them and keep driving you'll have shit efficiency and you'll end up like Gianni's in some of those torento games
If Bryn Forbes wasn't an absolute liability he could be having an impact like Payne
"0 Bryn Forbes minutes, I like it"
"I mean, he couldn't be worse than Bryn Forbes has been on defense, can he?"
If he wasn't so small he would already be I  the NBA. If Bryn Forbes can get mins in the NBA surely Goulding can latch on somewhere.
"There are a lot of certified QTs on the Bucks. Giannis obviously, Jrue clearly,  and quote me on this PJ Tucker could get it; his freckles are amazing. Pat's got some generic hot white guy looks, and Bryn Forbes is a textbook snacc."
"Fr that one foul on Bryn Forbes vs. Devin Booker highlighted this issue, my hands straight up over by body, but you unnaturally swing your elbow In a non regular shooting motion into my arm to draw a foul.  Not only should it be no call on the defender. The offensive player should be punished. You would see a lot less foul baiting if offensive fouls were called for these rip through, jumping into guys."
His offense is already nba caliber imo. Short wingspan and poor defensive IQ leave a lot to be desired on that end though. I think he‚Äôs going to replace Bryn Forbes in the rotation next year and could eventually work his way up to 6th man in a few years.
I am instantly triggered when I see Bryn Forbes‚Äô [face](https://images.app.goo.gl/igatq1nqWD568S569).
Not sure; outside of Giannis the Bucks have shot terribly for the majority of the playoffs. Coming into last night‚Äôs game only Bryn Forbes and Pat Cannaughton were shooting &gt;34% from 3 in this playoffs.   During the regular season they shot &gt;38% as a team
Lol. You mean the same Bryn Forbes who did not move his feet nor his arm? You could literally draw a line through his body and his position did not change. The Forbes call was the worst of all the calls.  I love how you then try to make it seem like you are some superior authority and nobody else knows anything. Like why would you double down on something so obviously wrong? Are you trying to make people think Raptors fans are stupid?
you‚Äôre clinging to the kd years let‚Äôs talk abt this year leading scorer while efficient with shit teammates and makes the playoffs any other year not many players could carry a roster that bad and let‚Äôs not act like bryn forbes is getting much pt this series jrue is a good defender brook is a good post defender same for portis and middleton isn‚Äôt a negative
"Curry is a team defender. It‚Äôs easy for him to look good on D when he has plenty of good defenders. Klay, Iggy, Draymond and KD aren‚Äôt bad defenders. LeBron hunted him 2016 and Kyrie cooked him too. Giannis has to cover up for his teammates. Guys like Bryn Forbes, Brook Lopez and Portis for example are worse than Curry‚Äôs teammates on D. Basketball is a two way sport. I‚Äôm guessing you have Curry over Kawhi too since his offense is ‚Äúon another solar system‚Äù."
"this is a part of being a star honestly. and i don‚Äôt mean the negatively at all. booker is wet but at some point he‚Äôll have a bad game or stretch in the playoffs and he‚Äôll get criticism for it. however the greats always have a redemption arc to it, and leading a team to the finals is not something many 24 year olds are capable of, even with a savvy sidekick like CP3.  seriously, i know it sucks. but there‚Äôs a reason these threads never exist for, say, bryn forbes. keep your chin up"
So many of those threes were when the bucks are already up 20 and  he was getting hurt when going to the paint. The heat wall defense worked great on Gianni's this season too. But as a consequence it got his teammates a ton of open shots. Bryn Forbes outscored butler for godsackes
Taking him out is leaving multiple people open from three. If they make them that's horrible defense. And that's how Bryn Forbes outscored butler in the Miami serie

YouTubeTV Commercials: 3  Bryn Forbes +/-: -3
I'm so glad Bryn Forbes doesn't play for us anymore
Bryn Forbes getting big minutes in a must win finals game ain‚Äôt it
BRYN FORBES IS SO BAD LOL
Bryn Forbes?
I for one am shocked Jeff Teague and Bryn Forbes weren't able to shut them down.
"Bryn Forbes is gonna have a huge game, very Reggie Jackson-esque."
The were one Bryn Forbes heat run from tying the game.
"&gt;Why are you acting like those type of fouls occur every single second of the game????  I‚Äôm not acting like that at all. I‚Äôm acting like there were multiple, different calls that went in the Bucks favour that shouldn‚Äôt have. They simply weren‚Äôt posted in that thread.   &gt;The fact is that every single time booker got a defender to jump on a fake he got free throws and the bucks didn't. That Bryn forbes foul was nasty  Literally 2 plays. You‚Äôre basing your entire opinion and you genuinely believe Booker got free throws *on every single pump fake* (which is a ridiculous statement) on 2 plays lmao  Think what you want man. Bucks fans are angels and Suns fans are the evil Vikings terrorizing the village or whatever. The reality is Bucks fans will continue to be sore losers like they‚Äôve been this whole time and I‚Äôll continue to laugh at them whether or not you agree."
Why are you acting like those type of fouls occur every single second of the game????   The fact is that every single time booker got a defender to jump on a fake he got free throws and the bucks didn't. That Bryn forbes foul was nasty
"We lost Donte and we've had split SG minutes between Pat Connaughton, Bryn Forbes and Jeff Teague. There really isn't any remaining depth to gut. Dame is also not going to be traded this off-season.   If you're an Eastern team right now planning on contending in the next two-three years you have to plan around the fact that Brooklyn will be injured. Because you cannot plan around beating them healthy."
"My only gripe with the free throws last game were the COUPLE weak foul calls for Booker and CP3. Bryn Forbes couldn‚Äôt have played better defense on Booker on one drive but he got the call. Otherwise thats not even close to why we lost (looking at you, Jrue.) GGs"
Bucks have to play small ball if they want a chance but that requires them playing Bryn Forbes lol.
Jeff Teague over Bryn Forbes is dangerous
"Bryn Forbes is atrocious, but you may have to put him in to get some offense.   Just put him on like crowder."
"Give Bryn Forbes the keys, it‚Äôs the only way"
"0-4, bryn forbes outscored jimmy locked in butler"
Future Finals MVP Bryn Forbes üî•üî•üî•
"I mean who else on the Bucks would you want to take those minutes, cause the options are Bryn Forbes or Jeff Teague"
"If Bryn Forbes touches the ball, it's a guaranteed 3 pointer in the next 1.5 seconds. Stop passing him the ball"
Why do half the 3s that Bryn Forbes misses look like Giannis shot them?
Fuck you Bryn Forbes. What are you doing
Would Chris Paul get that call? Be honest!  You know damn well he and booker would get that call.  Did you the foul Bryn Forbes was called for against booker? That was minimal if at all and that was called yet this wasn‚Äôt.
Bryn Forbes
"The one on Bryn Forbes was especially bad. I hated that call, if that‚Äôs a foul so is the one on Jae crowder, which IMO was worse than the Forbes one"
Forbes hits Booker on the arm. It was very light but you can see it clearly. Booker didn't think it would get called because of how light it was. There's a reason Bryn doesn't complain about the call.
"I mean it's contact all the same lmfao. Booker jumped into Forbes, idk why you're acting like otherwise. The same way Khris jumped into Jae. It's not like Bryn whacked him on the elbow, that was the softest tap ever"
"I didn‚Äôt say they weren‚Äôt. I went back and watched every called foul that Booker drew. The only one that wasn‚Äôt legitimate contact was Bryn Forbes‚Äôs 2nd with just over a minute left in the first quarter. Forbes didn‚Äôt move nor did he make any discernible contact on his contest while staying vertical.   Every single other shooting foul, Book had his defender off-balance, out of position, or there was contact in the restricted area with lateral movement. In fact, the one time Book initiated contact on his own, he got called for an offensive foul.   People see what they want to see, I guess."
Rewatch the game and tell me how Middleton never got fouled and how bryn forbes fouls booker when he‚Äôs standing still with his arms perfectly up vertical???
When Book ran into a Bryn Forbes straight up and was not moving. Was the most erroneous call that the Suns should not have gotten.
"Are we going to do this? Fine, bryn forbes wa bumped twice on the way to hole by the baseline and the refs didn‚Äôt blow the whistle.  On the other end booker pumps fakes, Forbes doesn‚Äôt do anything because he is a terrible defensive player, booker gets a foul call.  Forbes doesn‚Äôt touch him, booker gets the call, Forbes is bumped twice as he going to the basketball, the refs do shit about it.  Go watch the replay, there a dozen plays exactly like this.  As someone already wrote, Phoenix was allowed to body up all game, while mark Davis was making up calls because he is a hack. The call he tried to make against holiday until he was overturned is the epitome for why he is trash.  Just wait until game 3 when the refs flip it and suns get know calls."
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It‚Äôs the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don‚Äôt have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he‚Äôs 66th. He‚Äôs tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
"He‚Äôs a very good defender, good rebounder. His 3 point shot comes and goes but at least Bucks wouldn‚Äôt have to trot out Jeff Teague or Bryn Forbes as much as they did"
Why is Bryn Forbes getting 4th quarter minutes in the NBA fucking Finals lmao.
Bryn Forbes wtf... outta nowhere
BRYN FUCKING FORBES
Bryn Forbes outscoring Jimmy Butler in this year‚Äôs playoff series will never not be funny to me
"Bryn ""I got the green light"" Forbes."
"Bryn Forbes is absolute dogshit, every time I see that dude he takes some dumb off balance shot with smug ass JR Smith esque confidence. Dude sucks."
Why in the heck is Bryn Forbes shooting a floater early in the shot clock?
What the fuck was Bryn Forbes tryna do?
WHY in the fuck is Bryn Forbes taking an early shot clock two point jumper in the 4th quarter?
"Bryn Forbes is the least aware role player ever. Dude thinks he's the 4th star for the bucks.   Scratch that, he probably thinks he's *the* star"
What an unnecessary off-balance baseline jumper from Bryn Forbes
Are the bucks that shallow at guard that they have Bryn Forbes taking fallaway jumpers in crunch time?
Bryn Forbes just be hooping out there w/no care in the world lmaooo
Imagine letting Bryn Forbes try to win you an NBA Finals game
bryn forbes thought he was dirk what the fuck
 Bryn Forbes thinks he‚Äôs cam Payne smh
Man who is Bryn Forbes to be taking those shots smh
If MJ was on this team Bryn Forbes would never touch the ball again
Bryn Forbes is low key the worst player on this Bucks squad
Bryn Forbes: Defensive liability. But when he heats up it‚Äôs almost worth it. He‚Äôs a perfect bench punch of energy
you're exactly right with how you should feel about bryn forbes
i like bryn forbes #michiganman
Suns killer Bryn Forbes
Put that big baby Bryn Forbes in.
How does bryn forbes get a foul standing straight up and down and not even touching booker?
Forbes hive we out here he locked down Booker refs just bailing him out smh. Bryn finals mvp otw
Bryn Forbes eyebrows wtf ?? I have questions they look inked on
bryn forbes trying to beat thanasis' fouls per 36
why does bryn forbes look like she got his eyebrows done lmao
Super clutch to get outscored by Bryn Forbes
Yeah but regardless he got swept and outscored by Bryn Forbes
"Giannis was more of a facilitator against the heat,he damn near averaged a triple double ( 24/15/8) and that's his WORST series the entire playoffs. Outside of game 1 the bucks were blowing the heat out by halftime games 2,3 and 4. Also he put jimmy butler in jail on defense to the point Bryn Forbes outscored jimmy the entire series"
"I am gonna get a lot of downvotes but I have a hot take where I feel like the bucks got worse this offseason, they lost Bryn Forbes ( huge factor in winning the heat series) and PJ Tucker (his defense was insane in the playoffs and just like how the Heat missed Jae Crowder last szn, I feel like the bucks are gonna have a similar effect). They replaced them with Grayson Allen and George Hill (who was waived by Philly and was not good last szn). It might be a hot take, but I have the Heat over the Bucks rn. My order is Nets, Heat, and then the Bucks."
We really aren‚Äôt lmao. He‚Äôs just a good center with tons of promise and we‚Äôre happy that he‚Äôs signed.   Worry about Jimmy ‚ÄúI got outscored by Bryn Forbes‚Äù Butler
If you get outscored by bryn Forbes then you‚Äôre not the better player
"I think the Spurs are going to actively go out and try to win games.  I don't expect Pop to just throw out crazy lineups or sabotage games to build up losses like *some* tanking teams have done in the past (looking at you last year, Houston).  Keep in mind that if Pop returns, he is still going for the all-time record in coaching wins. He needs 26 to get there.  That said, this is the first time the Spurs haven't had a bonafide ""star"" on the team in like...three decades. Our roster is very young and we have a lot of new pieces....plus tank commander Bryn Forbes.   I think the effort will be there. With out talent level, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up winning 15 games or 40...but I would be surprised to make the playoffs."
"Replying ""Bryn Forbes almost had the same game score as jimmy butler"" to a comment about Dame possibly playing worse than Butler definitely implies that you disagree with the comment you're replying to."
Bryn Forbes almost had the same game score as jimmy butler.
"IDK why so many people think the spurs have a chance at being the worst team in the league. We went 6-5 without DeMar this year, Patty played bad in the second half of last season, and we replaced Rudy Gay with Thad Young. I expect us to be only a few wins worse than last year.  We basically replaced Patty Mills with Bryn Forbes, Rudy Gay with Thad Young, and DeMar DeRozan with Doug McDermott. The biggest drop there is McDermott but he fits better with our roster, plus Derrick White missed half the season last year and he probably would've been our second best player last season if he was healthy."
Mills is not a big loss. He played pretty bad the second half of last season. Bryn Forbes is pretty comparable to him.
&gt;  Bryn Forbes  Who shot 45.2% from 3 last year in the NBA vs LiAngelo who shot 34.5% from 3 in Summer League.
"We resigned Bryn Forbes, Pop's gonna put him on the hardest defensive assignment every night  We're strolling to that first pick"
I mean Bryn Forbes is in the league
I was just looking at a depth chart online and didn't want to bother typing in every name. Missing one player that averaged 12 PPG on below average efficiency when he started to play more minutes is not a big deal. It would be like me saying that someone's post is invalidated because they forgot to type in Bryn Forbes on our depth chart lol
"They still had a Xmas game though  If the Heat had won 2 fucking games, they'd be playing on Christmas lmao. Instead they went out like hoes all while their star player was screaming ""Stupidly Locked In"" and getting outscored by Bryn Forbes"
How many of those guys got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoff series?
"Zaire and Dillon are both 2/3s, and Zaire will be a natural 3 once he puts some weight on. Also Konchar is a 3/4 despite being short. He can‚Äôt shoot, and can guard bigger guys.   Out of those guys you listed, only Tyus, Ja,  Rondo, and Merrill strictly guard 1/2s. Everyone else has spent time guarding 3s.   Melton and Pat Bev are small but guard 3s because they‚Äôre great defenders. That‚Äôs clearly not their optimal use as a defender but they‚Äôre still capable at it. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre talking about 10 DJ Augustin‚Äôs or Bryn Forbes‚Äô here."
"you know what, well do the Grizz a favor. Ja for Tre Jones straight up. you know what, well even through in Bryn Forbes if that's what it takes. the math checks out, I assure you"
Out scored by Bryn Forbes too lol.
"I'll say it...I'm extremely disappointed with the Primo pick. I really wanted Sengun who is already looking like a stud.  The Spurs already have five young G/Fs in the pipeline with Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Lonnie Walker, Keldon Johnson, and Tre Jones. We also brought back Bryn Forbes for some dumbass reason.  There is absolutely no reason why we should've used the #12 pick on a 18-year old guard who will probably need two years in GLeague to be NBA ready. He was projected to go late first or early second round. He would've been a great pick at 25...but 12!?  I can only trust that Pop and the front office sees something I don't...obviously they've found diamonds in the rough before. But we left a lot of talent on the board to reach for a player who doesn't really fit right now."
"Everyone knows we're not going to the Finals, heck maybe not even the second round. Is everything just about winning the whole damn thing or tanking? If that's the case, the Sixers/Suns/Clippers/one of the Nets or Bucks should just pack it in. What's the point, right? Trade everything for draft picks, so we can draft the next Jarrett Culver (no offense Wolves fans). Also, don't forget about cap space flexibility‚Ñ¢, that shits important. Go ask Miami how vital that is, oh wait-  These guys talk about the Bulls like we're getting DeMar and Vooch as the chosen ones to lead us to the promise land. Like our front office is that na√Øve. That's not the point of all of this. The idea is to raise the floor for Zach to flourish and re-sign, while we also try to compete until Pat Will develops into the player the front office aspires him to be a few years from now (maybe something between Siakam-Paul George level?), AS WELL AS being a destination for free agents. It's no coincidence Lonzo and DeMar chose us. The culture is changing. Players are keeping a close eye. If we're spicy next year, we should be in the running for superstars in the future (just a coincidence that Vooch's contract expires the same year as Jokic's. It's a great bet that if Jokic enters free agency, AK, the guy that brought him over to the NBA, will try his damndest to bring the Joker in      Why is it that when Miami does shit-- zero draft picks in the future, signs Jimmy Butler to a 4-year max contract (someone who freaking got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the Playoffs mind you), commit 90 million each to a 35-year old Kyle Lowry and one dimensional Duncan Robinson, as well as throwing out their MLE to a zero on offense PJ Tucker-- it's all good. Pat Riley is a genius. #HeatCulture. I don't hate the Heat or their moves, just sucks that there's a double standard      But when we do the same shit, experts hate it. Zach is only 26, Pat Will is only 19, Lonzo is only 23. We're still a young team. We just got guys to raise the floor for these guys to succeed, while also changing the infrastructure for future free agents who would want to come here"
"Clamped up Jimmy Butler so bad he got outscored by Bryn Forbes, weren‚Äôt you guys going on about how great AD and versatile was because he played decent defence on Butler while he beat the shit out of you guys in the Finals last year?"
I wanna say bryn forbes for the upcoming season but imma hold off on that just yet
"&gt; It‚Äôs not recency bias to consider what we just saw from players over the last 6 months, and reconsider rankings accordingly  People who say these things are the ones who will say things like ‚Äúin a playoff series give me Jimmy Butler over James harden he‚Äôs proved himself as the real 16 game playoff assassin!!‚Äù and then see Butler this year get out scored by Bryn Forbes and call him a fraud. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have a jumper you will get exposed in the playoffs!‚Äù it soon becomes   It‚Äôs all so stupid and yes a big problem is people not realizing the degree to which even 15-20 game playoff sample sizes are small samples and not predictive of much going forward. A big part of it is not realizing how sample sizes work while insisting that the sample size they are looking at is a lot smaller than they realize. One new thing I‚Äôve seen is people insist ‚Äú18 games of Donovan Mitchell shooting way above his career norm from 3 in the playoffs is a good sample‚Äù and thinking it‚Äôll be predictive of future postseason performance which nobody who works with data for a living in any capacity would consider a viable take"
I said he‚Äôs gonna breakout if an injury from Murray/White happens and I got downvoted. After watching this game you can‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôd play Bryn Forbes over him at PG
"Defensive rating has a ton of noise. It also generally works better to evaluate a team‚Äôs defense or a particular lineup‚Äôs defense when they‚Äôre a significant enough sample size.  A single postseason is also far too small a sample size to reliably evaluate a player‚Äôs defense.  Trae hasn‚Äôt played enough to qualify for the active players‚Äô postseason offensive and defensive rating leaderboards. Or bball index‚Äôs postseason Lebron metric. Raptor recommends 1000 minutes at least and defaults to combining regular season and playoffs numbers (in which Trae has the 2nd worst defensive raptor, above only Bryn Forbes).  Even if you did look at just this past postseason, other defensive metrics don‚Äôt reflect as well on Trae. His d-Raptor of -4.6 was tied for 90th worst of 100 players. The only players that low who played multiple series (so one bad matchup didn‚Äôt skew the results) was Forbes, Conley, Monte Morris, Dwight Howard, and Rondo. He also was a -.5 in dbpm or 64th out of 91 which isn‚Äôt as bad but still isn‚Äôt average."
"Right. I agree with you there, and now it's becoming a 'what did OP mean"" type of thing lol we all know what 3&amp;D guys are, but the question (in addition to the title itself) was who maximizes value on D while being a 'big' threat from 3?  KD is the answer if you're answering 3&amp;D *capability* rather than limiting it to 'only' 3&amp;D.  KD's 45% from 3 is only topped by Bobby Portis, Joe Ingles, Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Bryn Forbes and Joe Harris. Neither of those guys are better defensively than KD, and those better defenders out there aren't shooting nearly what KD shoots from 3pt range.  Btw, I specifically gave a two part answer (KD/Mikal Bridges) to OP to cover all ground to because I figured the KD answer would turn into this when I saw it lol   Bridges was my answer of choice if we're talking specifically 3&amp;D role guys.  Who did you end you picking as the answer OPs question?"
Bryn Forbes GOAT
bryn forbes can stop anyone
We signed Bryn Forbes and have plenty of money. Patty wanted to leave.
"I'm think trade him to the Spurs for Bryn Forbes, Jock Landale, and 3 seconds. that'll do it for a guy I view as a potential all star I'm sure lol"
I am too embarrassed to go on our sub. Current flavor is shitting on Bryn Forbes round 2 after he came back with a ring...
Bryn Forbes and PJ Tucker
Congratulations! You have just won the grand prize of one (1) Bryn Forbes!
god you'd think at least Lakers fans could appreciate a guy who proved to be a better player than you could reasonably expect for his draft position. God forbid you just be happy for the dude and hope the best for him lol   you're worse than the Spurs fan who shit all over Bryn Forbes because Pop decided the undrafted shooter needed 30 minutes. it's not his fault too much was asked of him and his faults showed. Kuzma was a valuable player for a championship roster no matter how you alive.
Bryn Forbes
"BRYN FORBES, YA'LL!"
"you lost your best player in DeMar DeRozan, a great point guard in Patty Mills, and replaced them with Doug McDermott, who is ok but nothing special, a center who has played 8 games since the start of 2020 but is going to get paid 22 million dollars over three years, and Bryn Forbes, who is fine at best. you also had maybe one of the most whack lottery picks in recent history"
Ariza is so washed that we put Bryn Forbes on him in a playoff series and it didn‚Äôt burn us.
It was only 4 games. Jimmy had the worst series of his life. Bam played horrible too. Jrue was huge that series. So was Tucker. Ariza was trash. Crowder was missed. Herro was horrendous. Bryn Forbes was Klay Thompson. Keep building narratives around 4 game sample sizes rather than using your head. It's like you think the moment fans are out of the equation everything becomes easy
"I guess Kawhi? If you mean currently on the team it's Bryn Forbes, tho I love him"
Bryn forbes
Maybe with no Bryn Forbes and no bubble he can actually thrive.
Mf blew kisses to TJ Warren to get busted by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs.
"I guess it's when he said he was 'stupidly locked in' and proceeded to get out-played by Bryn Forbes and swept. Playing bad in the playoffs, especially after saying something like that, usually gets a fire lit under some people."
All this to get out scored by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs.
Jimmy Butler scored fewer points than Bryn Forbes while en route to getting swept.
Bryn Forbes son
"Here‚Äôs Woj tweeting what the letter of the law says thanks to year two of this stuff: https://mobile.twitter.com/wojespn/status/1424072119990816769  I would have to back and dig up the old tweets where the ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù were saying that these were the set of rules the nba would enforce  This year is more interesting because now the contracts are signed and it will be impossible for the teams to do a quick 180 and go with plan B of Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, and DJ Augustin"
"Hold on to those memories, it might be a long while before you get that feeling again with Bryn Forbes son on a max üò≠"
Why would I be mad?  Bryn Forbes outscored him
We really got a bargain for NBA champion Bryn Forbes.
Especially for a guy outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoff series.
Also first round legend Bryn Forbes
Because his team got clapped like 2 months ago by Jrue and Bryn Forbes
I was at the game where we gave Bryn Forbes a tribute video lol (same game we blew out the Bucks) and he came back to us  Have hope Toronto
"I think that this is pretty true, but, IF Dubs make a nice run in the playoffs, which is not guaranteed, there may be whole series where another player brings something to the match up.  For instance Bryn Forbes was huge in the Bucks - Heat series then had diminishing impact and minutes the rest of the Bucks playoff series."
A lot of our sub thinks Bryn Forbes is the spawn of Satan. He has flaws defensively of course but I‚Äôm glad to have the prodigal son back home.
Solid replacement for Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes 2.0
"i think he can be a more consistent version of Bryn Forbes, with maybe an ability to play better D  he flirted with 50/40/90 for most of the year and has some deep range"
"To anyone thinking this is hyperbole on the ""so bad"" part, we literally had two players who shot at or above the league average 3P% this season (36.7%) on any significant volume - Pat Connaughton at 38.9% (who was a stud for us all playoffs long) and Bryn Forbes at 37.1% (who is heavily carried in that regard by the Miami series where he shot 48.5% on over 8 shots per game). Everyone else shot at least a couple percentage points below that, and as a team, we shot 32% from 3 during the playoffs.   I don't know how much shooting a couple percentage points better would have actually helped us during our run, but damn would it have made things a little less stressful than they were."
"I realize this is just a meme for Spurs fans, but Bryn Forbes is a perfectly servicrable ""end of the rotation"" kind of shooter. Our problem was we had horrible depth that year and needed him to start, but that's not his fault."
Bryn Forbes and a Protected Top-55 2nd
You have a point there. The injuries to the nets and hawks were on purpose in fear of playing against prime MJ and prime Kobe super Saiyan mix Bryn Forbes. The sun's didn't get the hint.... And look what happened.
Once Bryn Forbes left I knew the repeat was never gonna happen
"Lol just because Giannis won FMVP doesn't mean he ranks ahead of Kawhi now. Kawhi is still the better player. Top 2-3 player in the playoffs and the most efficient. Who is expected more to score 30 plus for the team and also be the best perimeter defender? Only Kawhi, maybe Jimmy Butler but then Kawhi would never be outscored by fuckin Bryn Forbes."
Idk how can you say not when players like Bryn Forbes are getting minutes for Nba champion team
"Make that D-, that defense was worse than Bryn Forbes"
"not to hate on the bucks or anything, but they're getting a lot of love in this thread for having just won, but they lost pj tucker and bryn forbes and they added semi ojeleye and rodney hood...  meanwhile miami added tucker, lowry, and one of the psycho twins, as well as a bunch of people i don't know  the bulls added caruso, lonzo, and demar to lavine and vucevich.   the sixers added dru- never mind.  the wizards have got dinwiddie, kuzma, kcp, and harrell and they still have beal and rui.   the knicks added kemba to their hospital guard rotation too.  the celtics added back horford, shed their weakness in kemba, added kanter, and are still in the market for a few moves.   now i don't know that all of these teams will click, but these aren't weak teams, and that makes the east just that little bit harder to roll through in the playoffs, and brooklyn is still around with their big 4 or 6 or whatever they're up to now.  and since there's only 3 contenders to list, i think brooklyn has to be the one in the east, because they're the only team that is capable of beating every other team in a best of 7, even when unhealthy (see: bucks series).  but then someone will ask why i only give 1 to the east - i don't think the lakers will come out of the west guaranteed. the clippers still exist, the jazz and suns are largely unchanged with some small additions, the warriors have klay coming back mid-season hopefully, and portland's going to have a lot to prove to keep dame around.   there's also some of those smaller markets to consider who could trip up the big teams at vital moments and influence the seeding by stealing wins, even if they're not contenders. NOLA is making moves, though we're yet to see what comes of that now they've missed lowry and paul. minnesota has KAT, dlo, and anthony edwards, and i don't rate them, but people seem to have some hope they might all be healthy and ball out. i'm interested in memphis and what they'll do with ja running around adams, and there's always some fun to be had watching OKC do their thing.   lastly there's the kings, but i don't think we have to worry about them bothering anyone, so i didn't even really need to include them did i.  tldr: east - nets; west - pick two of lakers, warriors, clippers, suns, jazz.   ps. people will also say the suns had lucky injury influenced runs. i say don't count out a team full of young guys who ran to the finals on their first every playoff run. they'll believe they can do it again and i fully expect them to be a top 4 seed"
"Bryn Forbes, Drew Eubanks, the Coyote."
"I would not take him over any of those players, and it was an easy decision on every single one. You'll have some idiots in the thread saying, "",WeStBRICK iS nOt EvEn tOp 50 empty stats, give be Bryn Forbes instead of WeStBRICK"" are the ones who've never played basketball.  Even with low percentage shooting Russ does things that help a team win that other players are incapable of"
"If we are, why pay Doug McDermott instead of going after someone like THT with that money? Why sign a 30-year-old (almost) role player instead of a 20-year-old with upside? Why bring back Bryn Forbes? Why not already be in talks to flip the guys who are coming back from Chicago?"
"These Spurs fans comments are cracking me up. After he got scorching hot against the Heat in round 1, I just kept waiting for the next Bryn Forbes game‚Ä¶ it sadly never came. Maybe with more minutes he can heat up a little better. Or just help y‚Äôall tank by being a turnstile."
Oooohhh. I‚Äôm a bad Spurs fan. You‚Äôre a brain dead homer. Anyone that calls Bryn Forbes a huge asset knows nothing about basketball. Go back to the the Spurs subreddit
Spurs  We got 2021 NBA champion Bryn Forbes.
"It's silly for you to try and redirect the attention from your healing process to the Spurs roster moves, especially because it seems you're unaware of them.  The Spurs signed Jock Landsdale and re-signed Bryn Forbes, both good moves.  That's on top of getting some trade assets from the Bulls and adding Thaddeus Young and Doug McDermott, a quality shooter.  But you didn't ask to be informed, you tried to make a hurtful comment (yet again).  I see you and I acknowledge you are hurting.  Whoever hurt you can't hurt you anymore.  You are loved.  This is a safe place no matter how much you try and self-sabotage."
"I'm not sure where you get the by all accounts a much better player than Forbes for Lonnie. He certainly wasn't. People saw that Houston game and convinced themselves that it wasn't just a random player having a crazy hot shooting night.   Theoretically Lonnie had more potential and they both weren't very good so there was a rationale to playing him over Bryn. Reality is it probably wouldn't have mattered either way. We weren't making the playoffs, if we had played Lonnie more minutes earlier, we'd just have had more people come to the conclusion regarding Lonnie that came last season instead.   He's more than just raw, he is just completely lost on a basketball court, particularly on defense and it likely is far too severe that getting extra minutes will do much."
Why would you bring back Bryn Forbes but not Patty Mills? Why?
We brought back the prodigal son Bryn Forbes so I think we‚Äôre fine.
"TF?! When did we sign back Bryn ""Brick"" Forbes? Ugh!"
"Bryn Forbes, combo forward  The tank potential would be insane"
‚ÄúYou could not live with your own fai-...‚Äù  Bryn Forbes: üèÜ
TANK COMMANDER **AND NBA CHAMPION** BRYN FORBES
TANK COMMANDER BRYN FORBES
Bryn Forbes is also free at this point I expect both to sign for them.
IMO yes. CP3 will age better than Jimmy.  Jimmy's already getting outscored by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs.
I'm going with Bryn Forbes.  He's a mess on D but every team has a spot at the end of their rotation for a shooter
"Yeah. He's shown he can create his own shot when needed which is the most important skill in basketball... but put him in a non-garbage-time situation where others are taking attention off of him? I'm excited to see what he could do if given a real opportunity. He had a couple of minutes with the real rotation guys this year, and I thought he looked alright.  Even if he can just be a bigger, slightly smarter Bryn Forbes, that's a huge regular season piece to preserve starters' legs."
That's NBA Champion Bryn Forbes for you
"Man got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoff series, its not good now"
Dude if Bryn Forbes shot the way he did against Miami for a whole season he‚Äôd be an All Star too.
"Yeah, but they‚Äôll judge deep playoff runs, not 4 game samples lmao. Shit by that logic if Bryn Forbes had lost instead of won in the 1sr Rd. last year then he would be getting $20M this offseason."
7th ranked defense that let Bryn Forbes kill them again and again and again.
"There are a near infinite number of digits between 1 and 2 but none of them are 3.    There are a near infinite number of possible timelines, and none where Bryn forbes is as good as Reggie bullock on defense."
"Bryn ""Bud won't play me because I can't defend"" Forbes?"
"I mean just a couple months ago butler claimed he was ""stupidly locked in"" and then got outscored by bryn forbes during the course of a playoff series. And he's gonna be 32 when the season starts. It's not like he's still improving."
"Hahaaaa you may be right, I just remember being incredibly frustrated that a guy as athletic as Demar was consistently as bad as Patty Mills, Bryn Forbes, and Marco Bellinelli at defense. He just does not have any defensive awareness."
He's a great shooting 6th man-type who can't defend anybody in the entire league.  He's basically tall Bryn Forbes.
"At the moment probably bryn Forbes.  And it‚Äôs nothing against Forbes but historically  pop absolutely loves him and plays him way too much, and gives him way too long of a leash which costs the team games and hinders the development of our young guards"
Bryn Forbes could be a #2 on a championship team if enough people got injured.
Everyone's talking more about the top 10 but Butler and Beal are overrated too. Butler got outscored by Bryn Forbes lmao
The trade is more likely just an upgrade from Bryn Forbes.
Nobody in the 90s had depth though.  Like the Knicks and maybe the Rockets but by 96 the Rockets had no depth either.  Maybe the Heat but they ran an 8 man rotation.  The quality of overall talent was at it's lowest in the 90s and early 2000s.  Many role players today would be 35 minute per game starters in the 90s.  Like Bryn Forbes would be recognized in history as one of the greatest shooters ever if he played in the 90s.
"We'll give them Bryn Forbes. They don't have to take anything in return, just take Forbes. Please."
Pretty recent but Kevin Harlan saying HE‚ÄôS A FLAMETHROWER after Bryn Forbes kept going nuts against them Heat and then Reggie Miller not knowing what to but laugh because of Bryn Forbes superb shooting performance.
"Per basketball-reference, only ONE player in the NBA last season averaged 10.0 ppg, and that was Bryn Forbes. The rest averaged 10.1 ppg or more, or 9.9 ppg or less.     Anyways, with that said, here is my starting lineup of players who played a minimum of 35 games last season and averaged 10.0 ppg or lower...     PG: Cameron Payne   SG: Bryn Forbes   SF: Robert Covington   PF: Draymond Green   C: Nicolas Batum     Payne is a 44% 3pt shooter and Forbes is a 45% 3pt shooter. Shooting percentages may be slightly lower with more defensive pressure on them, but I doubt it would be anything more than a 5-7% dip (I would expect both to shoot in the high 30's). Backcourt would be slightly undersized, but if they are knocking down threes at a high clip, I can live with it.     Green would likely be the primarily ball handler, but Payne would take pressure off of Green to be the sole shot creator. Covington, Green, and Batum could all take turns playing center. They're versatile enough to play a bunch of different styles defensively. Rebounding will be weak unless Green averages 10+ rpg out of necessity.     Honorable mentions:     PG: Anfernee Simons / Ricky Rubio / Tom√°≈° Satoransk√Ω / Cory Joseph   SG: Talen Horton-Tucker / Kentavious Caldwell-Pope / Luke Kennard / Landry Shamet   SF: Danny Green / Kent Bazemore   PF: Dorian Finney-Smith / Royce O'Neale   C: Jakob Poeltl / Steven Adams / Nerlens Noel / Robert Williams"
"i promise you miami fans do not give a shit who you signed ‚Äî i get that, as a bucks fan, your entire day revolves around *BRYN FORBES OUTSCORED LOL* and ""bubble fraud"" jokes, but it's a one way street, we do not care bout what you got going on over there"
It can never be stressed enough that Bryn Forbes outscored Jimmy Butler in a playoff series
Bryn Forbes &gt; Kawhi Leonard
"I understand why people would take Jimmy Butler over Bryn Forbes; the playmaking is real, the rebounding is great and he's an awesome leader. But at the end of the day Bryn Forbes is simply the better two-way player."
"Bryn ""defensive stalwart and outscorer of Jimmy Butler"" Forbes"
never thought i‚Äôd see bryn forbes defensive highlights
We all know it's Jimmy's daddy Bryn forbes
"But Dragic was leading in scoring for most of the playoffs run. And most recently, he got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoffs series, who is a serviceable shooter and typically 8/9 man and didn't play the rest of the playoffs. Butler continues to be unbelievably overrated for bubble play, in which there was a season interruption, break, abbreviation and ultimately the most unorthodox playoffs of all time in being self Contained, no travel, no fans, no home court. And he was getting outscored by the aging Goran lol"
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
"Honestly I have no idea. He might become a dude putting up 20+ or he might just be Bryn Forbes 2.0. He grew and put on more muscle this offseason though, so I'm optimistic we'll see some more from him this year."
How soft was Butler as Bryn Forbes outplayed him in the playoffs? Gotta question his leadership and character now too
"Butler just got outplayed by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs, so he can‚Äôt win with those cats in Miami either"
Got outplayed by Bryn Forbes
we dont know if Jock can do anything yet. Neither do we know when or if Collins ever comes back   and in what world is Bryn Forbes a forward?
"Okay, we win on this one because we groomed him, set him free, and he has returned.  Bryn Forbes."
Bryn Forbes
"Bryn Forbes. He tries really hard, guys.."
"The Spurs are really good. Look outside of Kawhi or their stars. They turned an undrafted Bryn Forbes into a borderline rotation guy. Derrick White and Dejounte Murray were back to back 29th picks who became good rotation players. Going back even further, they basically resurrected Danny Green's career and made Patty Mills the guy he is today. Kawhi is the pinnacle of their development but they've done great work with a lot of players"
I think that's what Bryn Forbes do every game
"The Spurs had the least amount of 3PA attempts last year. While the Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson aren't knock down shooters, taking them out when you already lost Patty Mills and Rudy Gay leaves you with an absolutely nightmare. Bryn Forbes and Doug McDermott can help but neither of those guys are volume shooters. Due to Simmons being about the worst free point shooting guard in the regular season - at least 10% behind every other guard the last 3 seasons aside from Westbrook and RJ Barrett - where do the volume of points come from for the Spurs now? They won't scale at all by adding Simmons. If you want him to be the tank commander, fine, but I'm sure trading a combo of Dejounte Murray and Keldon Johnson next season will get you more in return to build around than Simmons.  Who cares if he got voted All Star? What does he bring that actually helps the Spurs improve or get to the playoffs?"
We took Bryn Forbes over him. I'm a huge fan of Bryn but he is perhaps the worst defender in the league.
"Lonnie Walker, Devin Vassell, Josh Primo, and Bryn Forbes are not players you put around ben Simmons in a half court offense. We literally have 4 years of game-play to show that this man is not some LeBron/Luka esque offensive initiator, he needs another creator next to him and us trading away DJ AND Derrick does not help that whatsoever.    The only thing this trade does is put Ben Simmons in an even worse situation than the one he was in before, and give the Spurs a lineup construction that makes no sense whatsoever. Once again there is no logic in this. What do you expect a lineup of; Simmons/Walker/ Johnson/ Young/ Poeltl to do in the western conference???"
I can't believe Bryn Forbes let this happen to himself two times
I think that's more on Bryn Forbes' greatness than a slight on KD.
TBH i don't doubt that for open shots. The thing is Bryn Forbes little unathletic ass is never getting an open midrange shot
My personal favorite is 2k21's mid range ratings:  Spurs MVP Bryn Forbes: 99 mid range  Kevin Freaking Durant: 98 mid range
If you hate the Heat it was very fun to watch Bryn Forbes blow them out
Bryn Forbes had his moments. Gave the series a quick fun burst but yeah that was it
Steph Curry  Seth Curry  Bryn Forbes
Bradley Beal  Joe Harris  Bryn Forbes
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
The same Jimmy Butler who got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoff series? That guy is a tier above the Jays? Lol
"He's regressed a bit since he's gotten injured but he's not a Bryn Forbes level of defender.  He's probably a sixth man on a contender though - drafting Duarte as his replacement basically signaled he's not in the team's long-term plans moving forward. Wish him well though, helped keep the 2-guard position filled since Vic went down."
"So the bucks didn‚Äôt improve as a team ? They added jrue holiday, bryn forbes, and portis meanwhile the heat lost Ariza and oladipo was hurt. Let‚Äôs not act obtuse the bucks were a much better team than the year prior"
What being swept by Bryn Forbes does to a team.
Hey that's NBA champion Bryn Forbes to you.
True that. But now we're stuck with Bryn Forbes minutes. Those are worse. Thankfully Pop learned his lesson from a couple years ago and is slowly phasing him out of the rotation.
"I follow the MSU alumni so Bridges, JJJ, Bryn Forbes, Valentine. Hoping more Cassius and Henry soon!  Don't really have a second favorite ""team"" though"
you did watch the heat bucks series where he shot 29% from the field and got outscored by bryn forbes right..?
Bryn Forbes and Andre Roberson
Everyone mentions Bryn Forbes but the reason he doesn't get as much scrutiny for last season is because the 2020 playoff run to the finals was so unprecedented and he was incredible to win 2 finals games and play at a whole other level.
Bryn Forbes: 3 and no D  Jordan Nwora: 3 and a lil D on the side
"Oh **NOW** the season has started for the Spurs. This team fucking sucks! How do you let a single fucking person beat you?! HOW!! Micahel Porter getting paid millions for 7 fucking points, Gordon immediately turned into Dwight 2.0 after leaving Orlando and there was no Juhmal.   Thaddeus young fucking sucks and I want to see how damn long people defend Bryn ""i can only do shit when I wear green,"" Forbes."
"Young team doing young team things. They're gonna play sloppy, they're gonna rush plays, they're gonna not be as physical. But these are things that can be fixed with experience. That and getting rid of Bryn ""Dead Weight"" Forbes. Fuuuuuck."
The drop-off from DiVincenzo to Bryn Forbes (the Buck's #8 in post season MPG) is about as high as the drop off from Hunter to Lou Williams (8th in Hawks post season MPG).  The Hawks have a deep team.
"Yeah, the best version of Giannis is the one shooting 12% below his average. Sure, man. He racked up assists because key role players like Bryn Forbes, Portis, and Pat were on fucking fire. He didn't ""become a playmaker."" He averaged 20 FGA a game, which is literally higher than his season average. He shot more and scored less lol  Jimmy erased himself from the series while struggling with a fucked back and the Heat offense failing to score from distance, which was a struggle all season after not getting any rest post-Finals. They went from 2nd in the NBA in 3pt shooting the year prior to pedestrian the following season. Jimmy needs space to operate."
it‚Äôs a bryn forbes gap
Bucks are completely fucked without‚Ä¶Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes was the key all along‚Ä¶
Butler overrated averaged less points than Bryn Forbes on way more shots please upvote
Bryn Forbes is on the Spurs now. He can‚Äôt hurt us anymore.
If they did then by the rumours it likely would have been a lot less. There was the talk of Bucks offering him 15/2 years but that may have been leaked by his agent because that's the contract he accepted from Miami and apparently they were after other Bucks entering free agency (Bryn Forbes and Bobby)
"He's like Bryn Forbes. If you're gonna put him out there on D,  you better see him gettting shots up on O"
He had a game last year where he dropped 34 points on 23 attempts. He played a little but he's a rookie and his defense is bad.  I think he's gonna fill the Bryn Forbes role on offense this season and if his defense improves he might get significant minutes
"Who is the best player out of: Party Mills, Grayson Allen, Bryn Forbes"
"Why does that matter? LeBron is a superstar, obviously he‚Äôll have more attempts than a role player.  Do you think he‚Äôs a better shooter than KD? Or Joe Harris? Or Bryn Forbes? Or he‚Äôll, even Wayne Ellington?"
WITH THE FOUL-HUNTING RULE CHANGE HARDEN IS AS RELEVANT AS BRYN FORBES
"Dekker sucks, but the Matt Thomases and Troy Daniels and Ben McLemores and Tony Snells and Bryn Forbes of the league are exactly what i'm talking about.   Shamet may be *slightly* better than these guys at best. Definitely not somebody I'd ever consider giving a $10M contract to, for any amount of years, certainly not 3 guaranteed years at that price... it's honestly baffling."
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
&gt; Shoot 40% from three in his career on over 5 attempts &gt;  &gt;   Bryn Forbes shot 45% 3pt last year (4th-best in the entire NBA) on 4.9 attempts for the team that won the championship. His career 3pt% is 41%.   Forbes signed for $4.5M/yr this offseason - less than half of what PHX paid Shamet.
"&gt; Also 10m a year for a good shooter it's about market value  What? No it's not - not when the good shooter is a 1-trick pony who can't do anything else.   Compare Shamet's $10.8M to some other shooters who signed this offseason:   - Malik Monk (40% 3pt last season) signed for $1.7M.   - Kent Bazemore (41%) signed for $2.4M. Better defender than Shamet.   - Austin Rivers (37%) signed for $2.4M.  - Otto Porter (38%) signed for $2.4M.   - Wayne Ellington (42%) signed for $2.6M.   - Nic Batum (40%) signed for $3.2M. Better defender and passer than Shamet.   - Bryn Forbes (45%) signed for $4.5M.   - Patty Mills (38%) signed for $6M.   - PJ Tucker (34%, but 39% for MIL) signed for $7M. Much better defender and rebounder than Shamet.   - Alex Caruso (40%) signed for $9.3M. Much better defender and ballhandler than Shamet.   - Reggie Bullock (41%) signed for $10M.   Heck, Shamet is getting paid more than Kemba now, a 36% 3pt shooter who is also a much better scorer and ballhandler.  Shamet's getting paid almost as much as Reggie Jackson, who is coming off a playoff run where he averaged 18/3/3 on 48/41/88 shooting splits.   Landry Shamet averaged a whopping 4ppg in the playoffs, and had more games with 0 points (3) than with 10+ (1)."
"That‚Äôs exactly the stereotype. If their shot doesn‚Äôt fall he‚Äôs complete ass because he isn‚Äôt a good defender. Bryn Forbes, JJ Redick, Joe Harris, Korver all fall under the stereotype."
"You still have to spend money on a SG, a SF, and a C either way you slice it or dice it. So let's say you get Shamet + Bridges and a bottom of the barrel C to replace Ayton, like Whiteside. Or you could pay Ayton and get a bottom of the barrel replacement level SG and SF, like Will Barton and Bryn Forbes.   When you put it that way you realize just how much more important the C position is that wings, and how hard it is to find quality players for cheap."
Giannis actually shot under 50% when Ayton guarded him in the Finals. It‚Äôs not all about individual matchups. The Heat keyed in on stopping Giannis and got absolutely torched from 3. It‚Äôs why Bryn Forbes killed the Heat and then could barely touch the court against the Suns.
For a second I thought Bryn Forbes was in the top 10.
"Bledsoe was pretty good the year before in the regular season. I'm guessing SVG thought he would turn it around eventually, he just never did. A few years back, tons of spurs fans were calling for Pop to barely play Patty Mills and for Bryn Forbes to take over his role the next season. It can work out but nothing's certain."
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
"Yeah.  Essentially having Bogi would have meant we never signed Bobby, we wouldn't have signed Augustin, which meant we wouldn't have had matching roster pieces for PJ, and we couldn't have even signed Bryn Forbes.  All 3 of those players helped at some point in the playoffs.  And I actually really like Grayson Allen as a poor man's Bogi this year.  Has a lot of the same attributes, and we got him for two 2nds."
Bryn Fucking Forbes
It‚Äôs changed bryn forbes for sure. The fear has left him. He just hunts shots now. Love it.
Also not to be confused with the series the Bucks swept the heat beating them by like 30 each game where Bryn Forbes out of all people outscored jimmy butler because he was shooting 30% TS.   Correct?
"If/when the Spurs play poorly, the scapegoat will be Bryn Forbes for getting torched on defense, and Coach Pop for continuing to play him more minutes than a player that should be getting more minutes."
Apparently guys who get outscored by Bryn Forbes are considered ‚Äústars‚Äù now
"I think i'd take two of the best 5 Finals all time performances in exchange for Bryn Forbes having one insane series against me, but again, I'm also just a normal dude"
"I almost feel bad for Butler, ‚Äúoutscored by Bryn Forbes‚Äù isn‚Äôt the kind of thing you ever live down. Even if it doesn‚Äôt affect how people rate him he‚Äôs gonna have to hear that shit for the rest of his career."
Jimmy had to go against known flamethrower Bryn Forbes give him a break
Lol a dude that averaged 9 PPG on bad efficiency the second half of last season is supposed to make up for kyrie? It's wild how much Patty has gotten overrated on here since the Olympics. He's basically just a slightly better Bryn Forbes.
"Saw Bryn Forbes once, at an Italian restaurant, right before he left to the bucks."
"Not only that, but on the last play of the game, Luka [had to be bailed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2AmbIypVMk&amp;t=590s) by noted defensive juggernaut BRYN FORBES.  LMFAO"
We had a major injury that‚Äôs my excuse. What‚Äôs your excuse for Bryn Forbes outscoring Jimmy Butler?
"If there is anything that Pop despises is lack of effort. It's why Bryn Forbes has stuck around despite his bad defense, dude shows effort even if it doesn't translate. Luka completely giving up on that play must have really disappointed Pop."
"Its ok, what can you do when you're playing DPOY Bryn Forbes"
Bryn Forbes won a ring. Man couldnt even pass the West Finals.
"I've seen a good amount of NBA players up close, Trae Young and Bryn Forbes are the only ones that just look like normal people."
Bryn Forbes game 2 and game 4. (Both 22 points) 6/9 and 7/14 from 3. He is the GOAT RSHK.
all that to outscore Bryn Forbes
"I highlighted some of the names (like Brogdon) that can play with anyone, but there are guards who haven‚Äôt thrived yet that fit the bill. Malik Monk, for example. Others: Cam Thomas (BKN), Bryn Forbes, etc."
"So you're capable of understanding that the Wolves aren't good, but you think Butler carries Wiggins and company without KAT? Butler joined two better teams after departing the Wolves. And if we want to talk recent playoff performances, Butler lost in the first round shooting below 30%. He never registered 20 points and he was outscored by Bryn Forbes who played two games worth less of minutes."
"Yes we were stupidly locked in, unfortunately Bryn Forbes was even more locked in ahaha"
"Also because the Bucks had some shooters show up from 3 in that series.  If Bryn Forbes shot in the Nets series like he did against the Heat, that series doesn‚Äôt go 7 games."
It's ok Bryn Forbes is in the western conference now

"No chalking it up to basic roster changes and giannis ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù is lazy. The giannis point proves my point even more.  Giannis has not been a bad playoff player. He‚Äôs played very well in most of the series he‚Äôs played in historically. The two exceptions are Miami and Toronto. Those teams had a rare combo of size , mobility, coaching and defensive prowess to use a ‚Äúwall‚Äù to guard giannis. Giannis hasn‚Äôt improved as a post player or a shooter. He still has those limitations. The main difference is for the first time, Bud decided this year to use him in off ball sets so you‚Äôre not asking him to create all the time when he‚Äôs not capable. Giannis became a roll man, something a lot of NBA fans have wanted to see for ages but something that was never even experimented with, and it was a huge part of their success.  Bud also historically does not adjust. He doesn‚Äôt change the game plan or who‚Äôs getting the majority of minutes depending on how teams are playing him. That was especially key in the raps series where Milwaukee started off hot but the raps adjusted to them. This year was different. Sometimes Bobby Portis didn‚Äôt play at all. Sometimes he played just as much as brook. Sometimes Middleton was a catch and shoot guy, other times he was a primary play initiator. Sometimes bryn Forbes was plugged in for a spark plug, sometimes he didn‚Äôt see a minute all game. He adjusted his rotation and how players were being used dependent on their matchups. That was a huge part of their success and it‚Äôs something bud has never done before, which was especially glaring when Bledsoe was playing like complete trash and bud was still trying to close games with him.   He also decided to play his players playoff minutes for the first time this year. Usually his stars play 34-35 minutes per game in the playoffs like it‚Äôs the regular season. He refused to give his players major minutes despite it being a very common playoff practice, which lead to having inferior bench lineups out there far too much against teams like Toronto and Miami that were playing their stars 40-43 minutes. This year bud actually played his stars a ton of minutes.  Perhaps saying their failures were all due to bud is hyperbolic, but the vast majority were"
"He was getting it in the right place even in 2020. The main difference is that instead of Bledsoe and co. bricking those shots you had Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis iirc turning into flamethrowers and of course, Middleton being Middleton."
Goes to show you how much Bucks fans know basketball. PJ Tucker was the main defensive threat to Jimmy and Bryn Forbes couldn't miss from three. The only ones with dumb takes are you Bucks fans. That's why yall keep getting downvoted.
"&gt; Bobby Portis didn't have any impact on the series whatsoever  Bobby Portis rebounded and hit his open 3s, how is that not having an impact? Hitting your 3s is the best thing you can do on a Giannis led team.   &gt; Kyle Lowry is better than Jrue Holiday in every aspect (except defense and even then Kylr Lowry is not too far behind)  Lowry is a much weaker defender than Jrue. And Jrue on the Bucks moves the needle more than Lowry on the Heat because the Bucks are a more talented team with a generation talent on it. We only needed Jrue to be the 3rd/2nd guy on any given night to loosen up Giannis and Middleton. Lowry being better than Jrue on offense doesn't mean anything.   &gt;  Giannis only had one game where he scored at least 30 points.  Yeah because y'all quadruple teamed him and he passed it out to our shooters. That's why the series was one sided. You couldn't counter attack once we actually hit our 3s and you rolled over. Giannis didn't have to score.   &gt; Brook Lopez did was camp under the rim when Bam was scared to shoot, but I expect Bam to take those shots this time around and pull Lopez out of the paint. Bam has the speed advantage then.  So Bam will suddenly outplay Lopez because *you* expect him to in your homer mind? No facts behind it, just because *you* a redditor ""expects it"". Okay.   &gt; Grayson Allen is not going to be the difference maker in a two peat.  So Bryn Forbes being gone is a loss for us and a factor. But his much better replacement (who could even start over Donte) is a non factor? Tell me how that makes sense."
"I don't see why people act like the Bucks are unbeatable. The main players that gave us problems aren't there anymore (PJ Tucker and Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes) and we actually had a major upgrade at the 1 along with a full offseason finally. I don't see us playing any worse than we did last season. I like our chances."
And he got outscored by Bryn Forbes in his next playoff series.
"&gt; I'm really failing to see how PG is the better player  you've conveniently omitted that jimmy butler just had one of the worst performances a team's star has had in (at least recent) playoff history in the first round last season. he got outplayed by bryn forbes  beyond this, pg is generally a more efficient and versatile scorer than jimmy + just as good of a defender"
Round 1 Bryn Forbes.... like what the hell
bryn forbes shooting lights out
"Putting jrue on dragic completely eliminated any ball mouvement in the perimeter . Having brook camp the paint prevented  easy PTS for bam , and Giannis clamped butler. Also, Ariza falling to post up forbes for multiple attempts gave the bucks a guy to hide their  weakest defenders and best shooters off the bench which they weren't being able to do in other series. Pat , Forbes , and Portis rained threes on the heat after they walled off Giannis. Bryn Forbes ended up with more points than Jimmy butler."
"Lemme throw in my experiences seeing NBA players up close:  Basically anyone around the 7 ft range (I've seen Drew Eubanks, David Robinson, Alex Len and Dexter Pittman up close), I still cannot comprehend how someone can be that tall, let alone *extremely athletic*  PJ Tucker, Eric Bledsoe and Justin Anderson look like powerlifters more than hoopers, those dudes are chiseled   Trae Young looks exactly how you expect.  Bryn Forbes is insanely short for a NBA player  Rudy Gay is the only person I've seen where their wingspan blew me away, I never saw him as long on TV but apparently he was a 7'3"" wingspan."
Also Bryn Forbes outscored and outplayed Jommy Butler in a playoff series ... that really happened   Biggest fluke champions we have ever seen
Maybe this year Jimmy won‚Äôt get outscored by Bryn Forbes in a playoff series
^^^^^^^ Tatum would never be outscored by Bryn Fucking Forbes lmao
"You have to bring up the other side of the coin because defense is half the game of basketball.   Trae and Luka aren‚Äôt great defenders either, that‚Äôs correct. Although, they are the leaders of their teams so they‚Äôve had strong defensive players placed around them that DEN can‚Äôt do as naturally with offensive dynamos Jokic and Murray. And in Trae‚Äôs case specifically, he‚Äôs a PG so he isn‚Äôt typically matched up one-on-one with the opposing team‚Äôs best player as Luka and MPJ would be more often.  I also think we as fans have a tendency to overrate the defense of our own players. Bad defenders become okay ‚Äúteam defenders‚Äù that are making strides and just need a couple tweaks, when the reality is they‚Äôre just bad defenders. Even on the Bucks heading into the playoffs last year, I heard arguments for guys like Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Bobby Portis being serviceable on that end, when frankly, they were major liabilities for stretches. If MPJ truly can become a neutral defender that would be huge for the Nuggets progression, I‚Äôm just not sure how likely it is."
You want Bryn Forbes? I swear he's not as poisonous as the last former Spur you got
"I don't think they've gotten weaker, but they haven't really gotten better either.  The only real playoff impact player lost was PJ Tucker.  Bryn Forbes was big in the regular season but disappeared after the Miami series.  The Bucks are deeper at guard this year though.  George Hill is a huge improvement over Jeff Teague as a backup PG and we also added Grayson Allen to the SG rotation.  The front office didn't have much to work with to improve the team this year though they could've brought PJ back had they wanted.  Supposedly letting PJ go saved $20 million in tax penalties.  I think the trade deadline and next years offseason will signal the true intent of the owners.  I do feel like they're going to want to get under the tax soon though to avoid the repeater tax getting too high."
Wow Bryn Forbes weighs 205. I would not have guessed that. He's 3 inches shorter than Dejounte and 25 more pounds.
Giannis did that with Bryn Forbes quite a bit
Miami Heat: Bryn Forbes destruction proves Jimmy Butler was wrong

"Bryn ""Bones"" Forbes"
"""The bookies"" who have the Lakers 2nd favorites behind the Nets to win the ring? Do you even know how Future bets work? Educate yourself on the matter before using it as your argument.  LMAO your basketball opinion is a joke to me after saying   &gt;his actual playoff run wasn‚Äôt great  IDC if you think he's better than Steph, he's better than MJ or he's worse than Austin Rivers. You lost all credibility right there.  &gt;The difference of what AD did to Butler vs Giannis in that playoffs is clear while defensive awards are so poorly given out  What? Giannis wasn't guarding Butler. Also, DPOY is a regular season award. Also, what Giannis did to Butler when he actually guarded him was much worse than what AD did. Butler was outscored by Bryn Forbes for the series and shot like 35% from the field.  Your arguments are all over the place and you make no sense at all. Imagine actually saying AD deserved than DPOY. I doubt even Lakers fans believe that today. Get a grip bro."
"I'm not sure Allen is a much better player now than who he was with the Grizzlies, just now he's in a dream system and got to play as the first target for Giannis' passing so averaged an absurd amount of open threes. A bit like how Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis last season wouldn't have shot 47/45% from 3 on another team, I think some of Graysons scoring is that he's in the absolute perfect system for himself."
"&gt; Spurs have been ass defensively  Except that's not actually true. Heading into tonight, the Spurs are 16th in DRTG.   We've been *average* defensively despite playing Doug McBuckets and the traffic cone that is Bryn Forbes."
"You know, besides that one team which won the championship last season and returned everyone except PJ Tucker and Bryn Forbes."
"Never, go watch Bryn Forbes and Derrick White looked like superstars vs Nuggets in SAS series, next round vs POR CJ McCollum channeled inner MJ closed game 7 for POR. Was like watching player drills around a chair in a gym over and over again."
Tre Jones needs to take all of Bryn Forbes min.

Jimmy Butler who got Outscored by Bryn Forbes?
Bryn Forbes
I think it's pretty clear Pop doesn't care about winning games at all. We're playing ridiculous lineups like Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks in the middle of close games and Thad Young played 4 minutes last night while Drew Eubanks got more than 20 minutes.
"He was ~38% on catch and shoot 3's last season which is on that serviceable-to-good level. Bryn Forbes first ten games last season he shot 37%, and finished the season 45%. I need to see more to know that the one shot they need from him isn't just suffering from a temporary slump."
random question but does anyone know what shoes bryn forbes was wearing during this game?
"Our bench was awful this game. I don't think Lonnie will be on the spurs next year.  Wish we kept it closer but it's not really the fault of anyone that matters other than Vassell, we got destroyed when Pop played that Tre Jones - Bryn Forbes - Lonnie Walker - Devin Vassell - Drew Eubanks lineup which isn't surprising at all really."
Just for fun I've thought about what Michgan State's team would be:  G: Bryn Forbes  G: Denzel Valentine  F: Miles Bridges  F: Draymond Green  C: Jaren Jackson Jr.
Bryn Forbes vs the Heat

bryn forbes
"If anything, wouldn't the modern day Spurs be the talent farm?  Bryn Forbes, Johnathan Simmons, Cory Joseph, Kyle Anderson, Ian Mahinmi, all started on the Spurs and became key rotation players, got a big contract, and/or won a chip.   I could be missing some people. I wasnt sure if I should add kawhi in that."
I'll take Bryn Forbes
BRYN FORBES.
Bryn Forbes
Seeing Bryn Forbes out of the rotation does put a smile on my face. No more 5 on 4
Who swept it under the rug?  Bucks fans still bring up Bryn Forbes every time Jimmy is mentioned on this sub.  There‚Äôs literally a guy doing that in this thread lmao.
"The entire team played like garbage. They got swept by fucking Bryn Forbes lmao. Herro was better than he was his rookie year, people just have no idea how to manage expectations."
"yes, i would send tatum to san antonio for thaddeus young and bryn forbes"
I low-key forgot about the change in ball this season...hopefully THAT's why the Spurs have been dogshit from three and not the fact that we are a team full of inconsistent shooters outside of McBuckets and Bryn fucking Forbes.
The Spurs don't have a great shooter or scorer outside of Bryn Forbes.  Every other player has looked reluctant if not downright scared to shoot the ball from deep.  Nobody can penetrate without a screen.  They're in love with the pullup middy when they should be attacking the rim.   Gonna be a lot of suffering this year.

We're stupidly locked in and lost Bryn Forbes
"I thought Spurs were doomed with such limited minutes from Jakob Poeltl, who is one of our two most important guys. (Key facilitator of offense, criminally underrated on defense.)  Luckily we got some great minutes from Thaddeus Young, finally. He and NBA Champion  Bryn Forbes kept us in it heading into the third, putting DJ and the starters in good position to close it out late."
Ya'll just lost to NBA Champion Bryn Forbes.
Bucks Legend Bryn Forbes showing out against his old team
Bryn Forbes is the only Spur who looks like he even wants to shoot 3s.  Which is a shame because even though he's a flamethrower we give up so much defensively to keep him on the floor.
"Looks like y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have Bryn Forbes anymore, the year before didnt Miami absolutely body Milwaukee on the way to the final?"
"Lol, i remember all heat fans being confident that they will sweep us again last playoffs, then Jimmy got outscored by Bryn Forbes"
thats nba champ bryn forbes

"Bryn Forbes is one of the most talented shooters I‚Äôve ever seen. He shot 48% on 7 threes per game as a senior at MSU. The rest of his game isn‚Äôt NBA level, but he‚Äôs an absolutely elite shooter."
Replace Bryn Forbes with Dewayne Dedmon and its an even most surprising title lol
 Curry is a glorified Bryn Forbes and CP3 is just a glorified George Hill. Shit post
Bryn Forbes when he gets hot is a dangerous player.  And doubling on Giannis means you are likely going to give Forbes a clean look because the Bucks move the ball so well.
"Sooooo Bryn Forbes just got himself another contract somewhere, right?   Also full disclosure, I am no idea who Bryn Forbes is."
"Obvious Heat homer here but the game wasn't as bad as the score would indicate. Everything in the 1Q just landed for the Bucks, they shot nearly perfect and played well. It happens. After that, they mostly kept it competitive (or as much as they could).  I don't expect Bryn Forbes to go 5/5 from 3 in the 1Q of Game 3 again but who knows."
"Truth, but his role was also still too big. If you are forced into starting Bryn Forbes for any significant amount of time, your roster was not constructed properly."
This seems like you're forcing Bryn Forbes having a great game into hating on Miami. He also out scored every single individual player on the Milwaukee Bucks not named Giannis but that doesn't mean they all had bad games
I wanna live in a cabin with Bryn Forbes
Bryn forbes is the third splash bro
"Why would it be a copy pasta? Because of the ‚ÄúS-Tier‚Äù comment?  Bryn Forbes IS that guy. Go out and ask somebody on the street under the age of 35 who Bryn Forbesis, and they‚Äôll probably be able to tell you.  I think he‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in a basketball world where everybody just tries to get as much shit in as possible.  Forbes is one of the central people that subscribe to the philosophy that less = more, something that I tend to agree with most of the time (there are obviously exceptions)."
Dame is like Bryn Forbes out there.
"look man, let me put it in simple terms:  bryn forbes ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time"

"Bryn Forbes is arguably the best basketball player in the entire world so I can‚Äôt really argue with him.  Best fundamentals. Best basic moveset. Best finisher (maybe of all time). S tier psychology in his shots and his swagger.   I consider an individual‚Äôs view on Forbes to be somewhat of a barometer of how much they ‚Äúget‚Äù what professional basketball is supposed to be.   The biggest misconception about the guy is that he constantly goes on autopilot, which couldn‚Äôt possibly be further from the truth. There wasn‚Äôt a single moment from 2012-2021 that they guy was on autopilot, when he was either the #6 or #7 guy on the team depending on what time of the year it was.   Dude‚Äôs run with the Spurs was incredible as well, capped off with an all time classic win over the Clippers. His feud with starting was the feud of the year until they ruined it with Covid protocols. He had a great night against Rutgers at Michigan State a few years ago. I‚Äôd also argue that he was the number 1 shooter in the league last year, well at least until Curry returned.   He‚Äôs one of the most iconic basketball players in history TBH. There‚Äôs very few people around my age who don‚Äôt know the name ‚ÄúBryn Forbes‚Äù. It‚Äôs truly insane to me that this guy can be underrated by the ‚Äúbasketball purists‚Äù out there."
&gt; Only out-scored by Giannis and Bryn Forbes  What a sentence.
"Not really, he was pretty good for us against Denver, we even called game 7 the Bryn Forbes game. It‚Äôs just him and Demar couldn‚Äôt coexist in the starting lineup defensively. And off the bench him and Patty Mills were a disaster defensively. He‚Äôs playing with Giannis so obviously he‚Äôd look better than playing with us."

"Honestly - not even upset. When you get obliterated that hard it hurts *way* less than a close loss. This reminded me so much of the 2014 Finals vs the Spurs. An AMAZING start to the series (first 2 games then, Game #1 of this series) and then the team wanting revenge clapped the shit outta us shooting what feels like 70% from 3-point range. Bryn Forbes Spurs energy also added to that effect lmao, some Patty Mills/Danny Green/Boris Diaw bullshit.    We're gonna get clowned for being considered bubble frauds. That's fine. I wouldn't trade that improbable run for anything('cept for a title lol) - plus I think it's looking more realistic that all 4 conference finalists get eliminated in the 1st Round this year. There's a bit of Heat soul-searching that'll need to be done if we get swept tho(I don't expect us to, I expect us to respond in Game #3) but if we don't - it's gonna be a long offseason, 'specially cuz the only rotation guys under contract are Bam/Jimmy/Herro."

"enjoy Cancun with that bum ass Jimmy Butler.   Clippers in 7 and PG had a great game. Drown in your clown ass hating self, but after all PG is winning the chip while that bubble fraud Jimmy Butler scored fewer points than Bryn Forbes in a playoff series üòÇüòÇ"

"So what's the answer, more PJ Tucker at the 3 or Pat Connaughton getting heavy minutes? Or even Bryn Forbes"
"No CP?  Also, no assassin Bryn Forbes?  ._."
a bigger bryn forbes
Clearly Adam Silver wants to see Joe Ingles and Bryn Forbes in the NBA finals
"KD, Kyrie and Harden all dropping a 3 pointer from the same spot consecutively is basically like the second meteor if you think about it.  Meaning they'll be defeated by a Bryn Forbes dagger."
"Our talent is mediocre. The 2019-2020 season saw Bryn Forbes start the majority of games at SG because we had no spacing, I like Bryn, but holy fuck you don't want him starting.  Our defense was atrocious that season as the only people capable of defense in the rotation were Dejounte, White, and Poeltl. This season, we went younger and more athletic, and our defense was okay, but we had even worse spacing than the year before. So of course roster construction has been an issue these past few years, and I suppose you can put that on Pop, but that is in no way indicative of Hammons coaching ability. I'm not going to say she's better than 50% of the head coaches in the league, but she's very well qualified and it would be shame if she doesn't get a head coaching opportunity in the next few years considering all the retreads that continue to find coaching jobs in the league."
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
Bryn Forbes 50 point game incoming
"‚ÄúBail out card‚Äù ...? Fans/media will say a lot of dumb shit that will have no impact on next years team. They could win each game 100-0 and skip will find a fault.  The more important thing to find out is what can they do to improve this roster? Dennis Schroeder seems to be a better regular season player, while rondo filled a role that was better in the post season. Tho rondo had a healthier team that shot better in the bubble. And Dennis wants a 4 year for 100 mil  Dwight Howard barely played in the later rounds, but wasn‚Äôt perceived to be an empty stat player like Andre Drummond. I don‚Äôt see them resigning him Marc gasol is shot. He makes the offense better but is a chair on defense. Maybe could be a vet for a team, but likely retires imo.  Trez was unplayable last post season and the same continues. A lot of players are picked on in playoffs, and big man seem to fit this category a lot. Bryn Forbes (guard) will likely be dnp/benched against the nets (using this as an example)  Matthews is just a guy at this point. Great defender at Portland, not special since the injury. Decent role player and didn‚Äôt need a lot to sign him.  So the question is, who can they get? Maybe sign and trade with Dennis? That would be best case scenario with him. There was talk that Beal didn‚Äôt want to move teams because of COVID 19. Beal seemed to be disappointed with the lack of awards he got while in Washington, that he would likely get in LA regardless of winning. Tho you think lebron/Beal/AD would be a title contender if healthy.   There‚Äôs rumors that Leonard would go to the heat, but that‚Äôs coming from the heat. And no one really gets quotes out of Leonard. But that would take clippers out as being a contender (tho they are down 3-2 in first round), and again make lakers better. Heat getting swept might change his mind if the rumors were true.   Paul George is another option if Leonard does go to the heat. He‚Äôs signed for multiple years, and owner might want to blow it up if this doesn‚Äôt work out. They would have to rebuild like the nets did tho, and they haven‚Äôt finished the building where the clippers will play at either. (Pretty sure on that at least?)  Is there another player they can get that will help lebron but also replace him?  Because that should/needs to be the goal."
Bryn Forbes
I‚Äôm gonna keep saying this Jimmy Butler was outscored by Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes.
Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes: 60 pts
Bryn forbes
He's better than Bryn Forbes?
"&gt; it's extremely close to the same team.   Not really. Loss of important guys, age related decline, it‚Äôs a completely different team.  &gt; Jae Crowder isn't an elite 3 pt shooter.   He‚Äôs inconsistent. But the fact remains that he shot 43% from 3 against the Bucks.  &gt;He got hot last year and then cooled off dramatically  He really didn‚Äôt. Man was cold during the Lakers series, averaging out his shooting vs the Bucks and Celtics.  &gt;I guess if those were your most important players your team should've kept them.   Not really. But even if they were, I‚Äôm not the front office so maybe try telling Riley that instead of me.  &gt;The truth is the Bucks just exposed the Heat and spanked em raw. And those three guys weren't changing that  Exposed what exactly? That the 2021 Bucks were better than us? Because last I recall they added really good shooters on top of replacing negative Bledsoe with borderline all star Jrue Holiday. It‚Äôs not exactly the same team isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs not exactly the Heat lost due to these ‚Äúmarginal players‚Äù as much as the Bucks new additions were key for them. Bryn Forbes and Bobby Portis shot over 46% from 3, and Holiday averaged a near triple double."
MAX??? Is he insane?   That means Bryn Forbes gotta make 52 million cuz he out scored Butler in the playoffs.
The KEY is Bryn Forbes
U really gonna disrespect Bryn Forbes like that?
Bryn Forbes
*pass to Bryn Forbes* THREEEEEEEEE!!!
You mean Bryn Forbes?
"Don't forget Jimmy shit the bed, got swept in the 1st round, and outscored by Bryn Forbes this year"
Or Bryn Forbes
"I have, he hasn‚Äôt scored over 18 in the playoffs yet. As a 2nd option getting close to 40mpg.  Meanwhile Bryn Forbes alone is averaging 15ppg off the bench in like 15mpg less than Bogdan is playing."
"Donte DiVincenzo is out, which means that Bryn Forbes will likely spend significant time guarding one of Kyrie Irving or James Harden. Other than that, the Bucks are a great matchup, and it's a series I'm looking forward to, win or loss."
"Bryn Forbes, Tatum, and Trae."
"Ayton, Ja, Bryn forbes, Dylan brooks"
Bryn forbes
Bryn *greatest shooter of all time* Forbes.
Bryn Forbes isn't letting the Nets out the East.
Bryn Forbes is basically that but cheaper!
"Better comp would've been Bryn Forbes. Poole is definitely worse than Herro, I'd take Forbes over him though"
Possibly but they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten Bobby Portis Peej Tucker and Bryn Forbes if they got Bogi
"Bryn Forbes. I advocated for the Bucks to draft him, and we finally got him this year."
"i think i read somewhere they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get pj, bryn forbes, and someone else though"
So take Bryn Forbes over Anthony Edwards?
Joe Harris might shoot 60% if Bryn Forbes is guarding him.
"He was a player who peaked during playoffs, like Bryn Forbes is doing right now."
"Nah Miami were bubble frauds lmao. Jimmy butler couldn‚Äôt even score more than Bryn Forbes in an elimination game. Bam was ass all series, Herro, Duncan, etc all didn‚Äôt show up."
Can both statements be true? The Bucks are so much better but the Heat regressed. Bryn Forbes played better than Jimmy or Tyler Herro.
But they played so much worse than they did in the bubble? And Butler got outscored by BRYN FORBES LMAO
Bryn Forbes is a man on a mission and Connaughton has given them good minutes on both ends all year. Nets also might‚Äôve lost Jeff Green. Donte is a loss but not an insurmountable one. Fear the Dear.
"Jimmy got outscored in the series by bryn forbes, thats about all u gotta say"
Just to get an idea of how terrible he was. Bryn Forbes outscored Butler.
They added a top defensive and on ball guy who has a good offensive game in Holliday and one of the better bench role players in PJ Tucker. A team that got better players did better ..... amazing. They also have Bryn Forbes
"Bryn Forbes &gt;&gt; Kyle Korver (way past his prime)  Bobby Portis &gt;&gt; Robin Lopez (another rim protector that can shoot the 3)  Jrue Holiday &gt;&gt; Eric Bledsoe (need I say more?)  PJ Tucker &gt; Eran Illyasova (more defense, and more corner threes)  This bucks team is KILLING it with their depth."
"Top 10 player got exposed; he got outscored by Bryn Forbes, who is the Bucks' what? 6th option?"
Ive been saying all year jrue and pj were huge additions...  but how you not even gonna mention my man bryn Forbes coming off the bench
"The Heat weren't bubble frauds. Anyone who says otherwise is just a circlejerking, brainless parrot. Jimmy had an extended period of injury and they lost solid pieces like DJ Jr, Olynyk, Hill, Crowder, and they got a post injury from shortened offseason Dragic and Adebayo. Then Oladipo fell to injury also. The team had no time to develop chemistry and familiarity, to form an identity.  In contrast to the Bucks who tried to reinforce where they were weak at and signed/traded for players who were defensive minded and gritty like Jrue, PJ and Portis. Bryn Forbes was also a revelation, and has fairly been decent on D. The Bucks improved leaps moreso than the Heat being bubble frauds.  Even the champs the Lakers felt the impact of the deep playoff run and shortened offseason when LBJ, and AD dropped like flies and they also signed new personnel but the thing with the Lakers is they always knew their identity because of Vogel - its defense, Defense, DEFENSE."
Monster? He got outscored by Bryn Forbes in this series.
Bryn Forbes was the mvp of the series don‚Äôt @ me
If Bryn Forbes isn‚Äôt the protagonist we riot
"Steph is more than a good percentage, that's Seth  Steph is percentage yes, but also location, difficulty, _and_ volume. If you can emulate him getting hot for even 1 game in your entire career you're not an average shooter.  Bryn Forbes is great shooter btw, not that 5/5 Bryn shots is Curry-hot anyway"
Bryn forbes
"i was a Forbes defender. dude was not playing his role and shouldn't have been forced to be a third option (second at times).  plus, the rest of our team's defence was so ass that we couldn't really cover that hole for him and it made him look worse than he was.  but DUDE TRIED SO FUCKIN HARD. you could see it in him when he would slam the ball down after he made a mistake.  really wish we kept both Kyle and Bryn because i loved those two."
Bryn Forbes.
"Lmao welcome to the pascal siakam experience, dudes been getting called beyblade for 2 years because he got injured and a freak pandemic happened resulting in 1 bad playoff series where they took it right down to the wire in 7 games, whereas the year before he was the #2 guy on a championship team.. he's not even a shit talker publicly.   Butlers whole shtick is ""muh work ethic, 1 am workout"" ""ill take care of the rest"" and the man just got outscored by bryn forbes, he's going to rightfully get shit on."
"But they found a new one in Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes"
"So uhhh, I've not seen a lot of Bucks games this season. Was Bryn Forbes always looking like son of Curry or is this a recent development? Dude was never even on my radar lol (vague recollections of him on the Spurs but he was just another name)"
Bryn Forbes is the new Tyler Herro and Tyler Herro is the new Bryn Forbes
The broadcaster for the Nuggets Blazers game said Bryn Forbes out scored Jimmy G Buckets this series. That‚Äôs rough.
"Plus, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes."
Steph Curry has Bryn Forbes posters in his bedroom
You mean Bryn Forbes?
"I love Bryn Forbes, he looks like the best dude on a YMCA Rec League"
"Again, look at situation. Duncan commands far more respect than Bryn Forbes. Look at what he did in Game 1 when the Bucks weren't guarding him seriously"
Jimmy Butler really scored fewer points than Bryn Forbes
"I mean Duncan is the better shooter in the sense he just makes wtf 3s Bryn is a great shooter and spot up guy but he isnt the same with off balance. And after game one Duncan was harassed off every screen while Forbes was getting open looks.   As great as Jimmy is Duncan is the only spacer of our starters (who hes primarily with). Bryn still had Jrue or Khris often times that can shoot but also playmake. Their looks arent necessarily equal.    Id be curious to their wide open shooting stats, ie how many each get."
And a Bobby Portis. And a Bryn Forbes. And a PJ Tucker.
"Bryn ""Forbes Man of the Year"" Forbes"
"I don't base my rankings off of 1 bad playoff performance. Also, Bryn Forbes is a pure scorer, of course he's gonna score more than Butler"
Because he just put up 4 consecutive pathetic performances in the playoffs and was outscored by Bryn Forbes.
"Like a lot of good shooters, Bryn Forbes (&amp; Bertans) could never hit 3‚Äôs in the playoffs consistently to overcome their defensive limitations. Of course, now he hits his threes and the Bucks look like they got a steal. Go figure."
"Going from Bledsoe to Holiday is an amazing upgrade, but still, it's surprising that the Heat couldn't even get 1 win here, and the way they lost was even more surprising. Butler got outscored by Bryn Forbes. who is like the 5th option or something?"
Lmao nice man. Bubble boys been exposed and Jimmy Bubbler the top 10 player got outscored by the great Bryn Forbes.
If only the Spurs kept that core of Bryn Forbes and Davis Bertans.
2020 Bucks didn't have Spurs legend Bryn Forbes
Mods hate Bryn Forbes confirmed üò•
"Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes"
"I can't see Steph Curry in the playoffs unfortunately. But Bryn Forbes brings me Skyfucker vibes too, so that's fine :)"
"&gt;a Jrue Holiday  also starring Bobby Portis  also starring Bryn Forbes,   executive producer much better coaching"
Bryn Forbes atop Brook Lopez‚Äôs shoulders is the best player in the league
Bryn Forbes is getting paaayed !! Hopefully Nuggets can grab him
I'm going to need to see some Siakam levels of slander for Jimmy and Bam. Siakam been getting called a beyblade and a gorilla for like 2 years now and he only had 1 bad series after getting injured and a freak global pandemic. These bums just got outplayed by Bryn Forbes.
-Bryn Forbes
MSU legend Bryn Forbes
"Bryn ""Steph Curry"" Forbes is the secret weapon this year"
Steph must've possessed Bryn Forbes cus my gawd was she shooting lights out
Can Bryn Forbes stop fucking dribbling
"Because he couldn't do anything other than hit open 3s. He was a turnstile of defense, wasn't a threat to drive or pass. There's a reason his minutes were down. He got outplayed by Bryn Forbes of all people."
Bryn Forbes and the entire bucks offense wouldn't have gotten so hot against Miami's stellar defense if it was in front of fans.
"Yes.  Did you know that Bud adjusted this year after all the criticism and instituted more switching? Did you also know that CP3 and Booker are two of the best in the league -- CP3 literally one of the best ever -- from midrange, which is the exact weakness that killed the Bucks the past three years?  Bud got legit criticism because he's been slow to make adjustments. It's not just r/NBA, it's guys like Zach Lowe and John Hollinger who've written about it. Here's Hollinger from today:  *While Lopez is a master at this coverage and showed in the conference finals that he can play ‚Äúdrop‚Äù even against a player like Trae Young, who most teams wouldn‚Äôt chance it against, the Suns are an even steeper challenge. Paul is one of the best shooters ever from the free-throw-line area, while Booker has exceptional craft in either getting pull-ups or blasting off on the way to the rim. Against backup Payne, the Bucks are more likely to feel comfortable playing drop, especially since Payne has the speed to roast switches.      The Bucks can play switching lineups too, especially if they pull Lopez off the floor and opt to play Giannis as their center. That arrangement puts Pat Connaughton in at the wing and immediately forces Ayton into a tough spot at the other end, where he either must guard Giannis or stand in the corner with P.J. Tucker. Alas, the Bucks are going to try to roll with a 6.5-man rotation as much as possible, which means Lopez almost certainly must play at least half of each game regardless. I have a hard time seeing how Bryn Forbes stays on the court against the Suns‚Äô guards, and Bobby Portis could have a tough time defensively as well.*"
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
bryn forbes is an eastern conference champion
Bryn Forbes
"Bucks are just not playing well. Bad shooting, sloppy offense, Bryn Forbes,  not enough Brook, etc. Just mistake on mistake"
Bryn Forbes looks like an actual baby
Bryn Forbes with the rebound and the forced turnover...I think he heard us.  EDIT: And now the lay-up.
"Because Bryn Forbes needs to pull up from the logo and take transition threes, silly!"
Bryn Forbes -7 in 3 minutes. Historical performance.
"Bryn Forbes is complete garbage, absolutely useless"
"God, I would fucking hate being teammates with Bryn Forbes. That little fuck kills all momentum by thinking he's steph whenever he gets on the floor"
Bryn forbes minutes = instant ATL run
Bryn should make a publication. Call it Forbes Magazine
Bryn Forbes has no business ever getting in the game. Fuck off bud
Bryn ‚ÄúJoe Harris‚Äù Forbes
There's a difference between believing and saying something completely absurd. I wouldn't say Bryn Forbes could out shoot Trae Young because it's a ridiculous statement and something that just wouldn't happen.
"Bruh, Bryn Forbes."
He wasn‚Äôt getting any good offers anyway though...  He signed to up his value same as Bryn Forbes signing for the minimum.
Bryn Forbes is reprising the role of Joe Harris from round 2
Bryn Forbes is so fucking bad
"Bobby Portis, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Thanasis all on the floor for Milwaukee while Atlanta has Solomon Hill, Okongwu, Kris Dunn, and Cam Reddish to close the quarter (while already down 15)  These are the best playoffs ever, I love when the conference finals feel like a preseason game!"
Bryn Forbes shoots like he has 1 second on the clock lol
It would be so interesting to see how Anchorage team would do in free agency. 20m/y for Bryn Forbes?
"Sure...of course they can play better. But no Giannis for the bucks is a bigger loss than no Trae for the Hawks... that was kinda my point. If reddish can hound Middleton and keep him in check like last game, I'm having trouble seeing where the offense comes from. Maybe this is a Bryn Forbes or Pat Connaughton game. We shall see."
Bryn Forbes about to make his daughter look like a dummy
"There‚Äôs no plays, or at least it doesn‚Äôt feel like there are. Giannis is good at getting to the basket. Khris and Jrue are good at creating mid range shots. Brook can score inside and shoot open 3s when none of those work. And of course, transition points.   THAT is our offense. Get it to [player] in a position they have success in and pray it works. No set up. Barely any movement. It‚Äôs all very telegraphed. Giannis is a perfect PnR big and doesn‚Äôt work with two pretty good shooters (making 30m+ each) to create points. The best play we have for one of our best shooters, Bryn Forbes, is a ball screen handoff from Giannis into a fading three. Nobody gets catch and shoot opportunities aside from drive and kick scenarios.   Brook literally can‚Äôt do anything on defense but contest restricted area layups/dunks, but they give him 30+ minutes and refuse to let Bobby/Giannis play at the 5 when they‚Äôre getting torched because of it. Pat gets 20+ minutes. In the playoffs. He also makes 5m a year. Meanwhile, Bobby our performs Brook every night he gets to play (despite significantly less minutes) and still comes off the bench and doesn‚Äôt receive any more minutes. He makes 3.6m a year, with a player option for next year that he should absolutely decline to actually play/get paid somewhere else. But Pat and Brook are locked in :).  Only smart and effective utilization on the team is PJ Tucker. He‚Äôs starting now and guards whoever he‚Äôs asked to, shoots open corner threes, and passes. Literally everyone else would be in a better situation anywhere else in the league because of coaching.   Oh and ‚Äúso much firepower‚Äù is probably referring to the fact that we mysteriously have lost the ability to make 3s in the playoffs after being a top 3? attempt/percentage team in the regular season. With all the injuries we‚Äôve faced, I doubt we drop a game if we shoot anywhere close to what we did in the regular season. Check the stats from every blowout. Most were average regular season 3pt shooting splits."
Sadly Jimmy Butler assassinated KAT‚Äôs character so people think he‚Äôs trash/soft compared to other bigs. Meanwhile he‚Äôs out there getting outplayed by Bryn Forbes lmfao
He's talking about Facundo Campazzo and Bryn Forbes guys.
"watch the video, he literally uses your example.   You are arguing about inches, it doesn't really matter that much. The game was different, tons of marginal role players would be better today and vice versa. Robert Horry would be getting close to a max probably. Is kerr any less athletic or small than bryn forbes?"
"Given how these playoffs have gone, Bryn Forbes will win Finals MVP"
That‚Äôs only four 3 pointers away from a single digit game.. Bryn Forbes can do it in his sleep
Am I crazy or did Marv just call Bryn Forbes ‚ÄúFlynn‚Äù
Bryn ‚Äúbasically Klay Thompson‚Äù Forbes
Bryn Forbes
The guy who didn‚Äôt let Bryn Forbes out score him in a playoff series
"I think a championship contender was an ambitious ask honestly. After Kyrie left they were due for a youth movement imho. Getting to another conference finals after he left was nothing short of astounding  Usually teams that need space can trade their crap money with picks to tanking teams and the Celtics were really clear candidates for that with 2 stars under 25. They didnt have a plan for their draft picks and they were a step slow in assessing if they could really win a title, which is entirely fine but with some of the older guys on the roster you wonder if they could have been in the market for some more young rotation level giards/wings that they were really hurting for this year like Gary Harris, Norman Powell, Bryn Forbes, Duncan Robinson. Those type of guys could have really helped realign the franchise on Tatum/Brown's timeline. And they really didn't have a clue what they wanted with their picks anyways."
"Forbes has a player option (and may have played himself into a little bit more money).  Tucker is UFA, but should probably be easy to keep unless somebody gives him way too much money...the Bucks have his bird rights, so they can keep him if he wants to stay.   The trouble is they're going to lose Portis, who will definitely decline his player option and get far more than they can pay him as a non-Bird FA.  They could give him the mini-MLE, but that would be it for them.    They really need to just find this summer's Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes.  There isn't a combination of assets outside their Big 3 that can net them anything great."
Bryn Forbes strikes me as an overly confident individual
"Yeah I mean to a certain point, defensive stats are noisy especially with such a small sample size. Lou‚Äôs numbers are pretty clear outliers based on his career and, as you said, don‚Äôt match the eye test. So it‚Äôs one of the times where you can reasonably say, there‚Äôs context we‚Äôre missing because this guy is almost certainly a negative.   But Trae‚Äôs regular season numbers make it way harder to argue the postseason ones are mistaken. He‚Äôs tied with Bryn Forbes for 2nd to last in d-raptor of 395 who played at least 350 minutes (R.J. Hampton is 395th). He‚Äôs tied with Beal, Anthony Edwards, and Lonnie Walker for 165th out of 179 qualifying guys in dbpm. And he‚Äôs 4th worst in the league in Bball index‚Äôs d-Lebron behind  D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Anfernee Simons, and Lonnie.  And listen Trae‚Äôs so fucking talented anyway that being a negative defensively doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt still a clear net positive overall. You can see that in the advanced stats with offensive and defensive parts because the combination of them is a net positive due to just how high Trae‚Äôs numbers are on offense."
Bryn Forbes takes some absolutely braindead threes.
Bryn Forbes one leg over capela? Is that the shot you want bucks?
Reminder that Bryn Forbes never drew a charge during his time in San Antonio. Has he drawn a charge in Milwaukee???
"Why does Bryn Forbes play? He chucks every time he touches the ball. Doesn't make anything come of it, doesn't take a good shot, he legit just chucks it."
"Perfect and most realistic IMO: sign one of Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, or Devotne Graham on a medium sized deal. Have a decent prospect fall to us in round 2 pick 38, someone who can immediately contribute. Sign and trade markkanen to get something for him. Keep Theis, Temple, Green. Waive Arcidiacano, sign a forward and a 3 and D wing. Furkan Korkmaz or Tony snell. Also should be interested in Bryn Forbes"
"The point isn't that Gobert isn't a way better player, it's that taking Lopez out and plugging him in fucks with the roster construction in a way that makes it much harder for our main guy to score. Lopez being able to hit a three means we can let our PF run at the paint in a way that few other C's can really allow.  You can swap out Lopez/PJ for Forbes/Gobert but then you're making the defense actually *worse* (PJ for Forbes is about the biggest possible defensive downgrade you can make) and re-tooling the offense away from Giannis and toward Bryn Forbes and maybe Rudy Gobert."
yes did you know that bryn forbes is better than butler!
Because Bryn Forbes out scored  butler in the 2021 nba playoffs not located in Disney world
"yes bryn forbes is better than jimmy butler, my bad"
And Jimmy Butler got outscored by Fucking Bryn Forbes lmaooo
"13% of the Bucks plays during the post season have been isolation plays. Clippers are at 14%, Hawks &amp; Suns at 7%  I take your point that it's more isolation than you'd like but pretending that's all they run is just facetious.  Budenholzer has always had a rep as a defensive coach.  Heres a good bit on the Bucks offensive improvements from the Miami series [clicky](https://behindthebuckpass.com/2021/05/28/milwaukee-bucks-mike-budenholzer-pushing-right-buttons-postseason/)  &gt;On the offensive end, we‚Äôve seen the team play with much more structure and motion than a season ago. Rather than using Giannis Antetokounmpo as the primary ball handler on most possessions in the half-court, the Bucks have been increasingly using him more frequently as a screener or roller in pick-and-roll situations with Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton.  &gt;The team has also been setting more off-ball screens away from the main play to create room for shooters and cutters. This has created more space for players to get open shots at the rim in the corners or above the break spots. This has especially benefited guys like Bryn Forbes, whose dynamic shooting ability has given the team something they sorely lacked in their past two post-season trips.  &gt;Three other areas that the Bucks have found success on offense is through their more aggressive ball movement, greater use of transition, especially in secondary transition opportunities and a clear intent to attack mismatches when they create them."
"Too be fair, it took Pop 1.5 years to realize LMA wasn‚Äôt great and Jakob needed more minutes.  He also spent a whole season playing Bryn Forbes 25+ minutes a game, instead of Lonnie Walker‚Ä¶  He‚Äôs certainly not some perfect coach.  Firing him is clearly wrong, but there is plenty there to criticize."
I'd be surprised if I saw Bryn Forbes ever dunk a basketball
Bryn Forbes needs to go back to the bench. All he does is chuck up shots like he has the Curry green light.
"If you squint real hard, Bryn Forbes looks like Steph"
God Bryn Forbes was Steph against us and he‚Äôs been ass against everyone else smh
&gt;We'll have to see. The thing about Bryn Forbes is that he has games where he'll score 10+ points and then he might disappear completely the next game. Happened during the Nets series. He could have a decent night tonight. I think keeping Trae on Connaughton should be good enough for Trae to hide. Connaughton is not good at all especially if he can't hit three's.
"&gt; Hunter and Reddish  That they haven't been playing is why I didn't mention them. I think the biggest mismatch problem in this series for Atlanta is Khris Middleton who played like hot garbage in game 1.  The only guy who can realistically guard him is Solomon Hill, but he's useless offensively. If I was Bud, I'd match Solomon Hill's minutes exactly with Bryn Forbes so that there was a place to hide Forbes on defense (That dude makes Trae look like Gary Payton) while making your guards defend him on the offensive end.  If Hunter was playing, that would solve those issues completely IMO."
"The only critique is that Bryn Forbes probably should have been in instead of PJ Tucker. They had to foul if the wot was missed anyway, so there‚Äôs no downside to playing a worse defender.   And if Forbes was in, then Tucker would‚Äôve been in the corner, and it would‚Äôve been a wide open wing 3 for Forbes, who is a significantly better shooter."
Because honestly Bud should have had Bryn Forbes in on that play
1. Because he‚Äôs Pat Connaughton. 2. Because he was already struggling from field that day. 3. Because he‚Äôs only out there because the coach forgot Bryn Forbes exists. 4. Because he‚Äôs Pat Connaughton!
"As a completely neutral fan, when Bryn Forbes hit like 4 straight threes including a buzzer beater, and then got rewarded with the exact same rotation the following quarter, where he was on the bench, it made me want to jump off a bridge.   So yeah prob safe bet."
"Buddy, Jimmy Butler averaged a paltry 14.5 ppg on 29% shooting from the field and 39 TS% and got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs this year. No other star player has ever put up a bad stat line as Butler did in the playoffs this year, not even Westbrook. Even last year in the bubble, he wasn‚Äôt even the leading scorer for the Heat in the playoffs until the Finals, Dragic was. Besides, Butler has never even made it past the 2nd round in his career outside of the bubble."
Bryn Forbes facial hair makes me feel uncomfortable
Y‚Äôall remember when Bryn Forbes outscored Jimmy in the first round
Is Bryn Forbes the biggest chucker in the nba? He shoots probably 90 percent of the time he touches the ball. Shit is so obnoxious
Bryn forbes looks like a myplayer preset
We've got a Bryn Forbes sighting!
"Bryn Forbes should be utilized much more often,underrated sniper."
bryn forbes is more valuable to his team vs the hawks than ben fucking simmons was
Bryn Forbes gonna go off tonight like 2/4 from deep
"I read a [solid article](https://airalamo.com/2020/05/07/demar-derozan-perspective-san-antonio-spurs-becky-hammon/) explaining what kind of coach she is. Basically a player's coach in the mold of Pop (obviously) and someone who's not afraid to push her players. Not to mention she was instrumental in developing the young guys in SA. From the article:  &gt;She‚Äôs a noble leader, one who connects with players and teaches them to be the best versions of themselves. Her imprint has made a noticeable impact on the growth and development of young players like Bryn Forbes and Derrick White. Hammon‚Äôs guard expertise in her own playing days made her a one-of-a-kind point guard and now, she‚Äôs instilling those floor general qualities in the next generation of Spurs.     I'd imagine her background as a guard should help her work with Lillard and, should the team decide to blow it up and trade Damian, she'll be around to mentor any young players they get back."
Fair. But look at a player like Bryn Forbes. He can shoot the lights out but he really has no other skills and might be the worst defender I've ever seen. Yet he still gets more or less consistent playoff minutes.
"Fun fact - you can make a great ""Undrafted Team"" from the 2016 draft:   **PG:** Fred VanVleet, Yogi Ferrell, Ryan Arcidiacono.  **SG:** Alex Caruso, Bryn Forbes, Damion Lee.  **SF:** Danuel House Jr, Derrick Jones Jr.  **PF:** Dorian Finney-Smith, David Nwaba.  Except for **C**, where there's just Marshall Plumlee lol."
"uhh, Steve Kerr? Tony Parker? Richard Jefferson? Gary Neal? Danny Green? Marco Belinelli? Kyle Anderson? Bryn Forbes?  Dejounte is getting a lot better too.  Chip has drastically helped develop and improved the shooting of all these guys. and those were just off the top of my head."
"If Bryn Forbes does what he did in the Heat's matchup, its over in 4."
I'm rooting for the bucks now that the sixers are out because of Bryn Forbes
"I thought about it, but wanted to keep the table in the OP a little cleaner. That said, here's that data:  &amp;#x200B;  |(1) Kevin Huerter|Maryland|139 pts (12 games)| |:-|:-|:-| |(2) Tim Hardaway Jr.|Michigan |119 pts (7 games)| |(T3) Bryn Forbes|Michigan State|92 pts (11 games)| |(T3) Mike Conley|Ohio State|92 pts (6 games)| |(5) Jaren Jackson Jr.|Michigan State|68 pts (5 games)| |(T6) Kendrick Nunn|Illinois|41 pts (4 games)| |(T6) Duncan Robinson|Michigan|41 pts (4 games)| |(8) Romeo Langford|Indiana|36 pts (4 games)| |(9) Alex Len|Maryland|20 pts (5 games)| |(10) E'Twaun Moore|Purdue|11 pts (3 games)| |(11) Frank Kaminsky|Wisconsin|10 pts (6 games)| |(T12) Amir Coffey|Minnesota|5 pts (7 games)| |(T12) Carsen Edwards|Purdue|5 pts (2 games)| |(14) Daniel Oturu|Minnesota|4 pts (5 games)| |(15) Jalen Smith|Maryland|3 pts (3 games)| |(T16) Yogi Ferrell|Indiana|2 pts (6 games)| |(T16) Bruno Fernando|Maryland|2 pts (2 games)| |(T16) Cassius Winston|Michigan State|2 pts (1 game)| |(T16) Xavier Tillman Sr.|Michigan State|2 pts (3 games)| |(20) Trey Burke|Michigan |1 pt (2 games)|"
you guys match up evenly. the X factor is bryn forbes.  hopefully bud plays bryn more in the ec finals
Although they were essentially non existent in the Brooklyn series...Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes have been pretty damn good role players all year. I'm curious to see how they matchup with ATL or PHI
"4 3PA per 36 is low volume for a shooting specialist  for reference, seth curry shot 6.3, kennard shot 6.5, harris 7.5, ant simons shot 9.3 and bryn forbes shot 10 (per 36)  he‚Äôs not comparable with other shooters in the league idk why you are hyping him that much, but im glad the man has fans lol, i actually like him as a player"
Bryn Forbes had a similar bed shitting. I think he was close to the top in regular season 3pt% too.
Bryn forbes is a flamethrower tho
No team is putting the game in the hands of guys like Bryn Forbes and Chris Chiozza
Why has Bryn Forbes disappeared from the bucks
I would put in Bryn Forbes for Holiday
Why did bryn forbes only play for like a possession then got subbed out
Why is Pat Connaughton getting this many minutes in a game 7? Is Bryn Forbes that bad?
Boggles my mind that we have a fucking three point fucking specialist in Bryn Forbes on the court and we can't get him open because Bud's play calling is utter ass. I want him gone.
"I know the Nets will probably win given how the series has gone, but I voted Bucks. Screw the Nets and their superteam made of the most hated stars in the league. Praying that Bryn Forbes goes nuclear or something"
Bryn Forbes dropping 40 tonight
Also 2 points for CSU legend Bryn Forbes.
That's Bryn Forbes boss fight music
Lmao believe me we wish we had that Bryn Forbes this series
Bryn Forbes
Griffin just got burnt by Bryn Forbes sheesh
Bryn Forbes? He was buckets in that Heat series.
Lmao. Here comes Bryn Forbes!!
Damn Bryn Forbes getting payed like 60 million a year huh?
He strongly declined when he got outscored by Bryn Forbes LOL
"A max contract for a ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù who got outscored by Bryn Forbes in the playoffs and shot less than 30% from the field lol, that‚Äôs all you gotta say"
Bryn forbes outscored him
Shit dude max Bryn Forbes then only 4 games in the playoffs matter
Man got outplayed by Bryn Forbes
I'm fucking weak. A max for a guy who had less points in a series than Bryn Forbes üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Mf got out scored by Bryn Forbes and got a max.
Bryn Forbes
This is like Bryn Forbes vs Butler in the Miami - Bucks series  Shams shitting on Woj
Mf got out scored by Bryn Forbes and got a max.
The guy that got outscored by Bryn Forbes in a 4 game series?
Not sure how you can be worth big money as a wing who cannot shoot. He had one good stretch where he lived at the free throw line. Outside of that the guy is mostly unplayable and was out scored in his latest playoff series by Bryn Forbes
"&gt; he was chucking threes like an idiot he shot 55% from the field without those threes  **He averaged more 3PT attempts per game in the Nets series**. 1/16 in 4 games against the Heat, 8/31 against the Nets in 7 games. Do the math.  &gt;He didn't even need to score when Bryn Forbes was averaging more points than Jimmy Butler  He was taking 20 shots per game in the Heat series. And not making many of them. So that role change between those series must've gone like this:  ""Giannis, we need you to keep shooting a lot, but this time actually make those shots."""
"It's not wrong, Giannis was not efficient in that series but he was playing a completely different role and the Bucks role players were shitting on the Heat  He didn't even need to score when Bryn Forbes was averaging more points than Jimmy Butler   He averaged 8 assists, he averaged 3.6 vs Brooklyn, he had a completely different type of series"
"Why would they not bother pressing you as soon as the ball touches your hands, it's a free steal. You can't dribble or lift the ball outside of the fetal position without the shittiest defender in the league grabbing it out of your hands. Trae young and bryn forbes would bully the fuck out of you"
"This isn't true at all. Lu Dort signed with OKC and FVV to Toronto. Bryn Forbes to San Antonio, etc. Second rounders that forgo the draft go where they think they will thrive either with minutes or by just being in the right situation to show their strengths."
"Really? Standouts are Zach/Vuc/Lauri/Sato/Thad/PWill/Coby. Sato and Thad are role players in the vein of the Jae Crowders and Bryn Forbes of the league. Everyone else is literally replaceable in the role they played for us.  A point guard in itself only solves one issue of the bulls. Our defense is sorely lacking. Would legit need PWill to be Covington and Coby to end up being Lou Williams for the bulls to be competitive the way the bulls are currently built. Look across the East Division and realistically, who do you see the bulls being competitive with? 76ers/Bucks/Nets/Hawks/Heat/Celtics/Knicks are easily better than us so we are competing with Hornets/Pacers/Wizards/Raptors retooling and the Pistons/Cavs are fast on our heels with their youth."
It was a pleasure doing business with you. By the way what would you say if we spicy up the deal and you give PG and we give say Bryn Forbes?
"Pretty sure this happened with Bryn Forbes too. He had teams wanting to draft him in the late second round, but decided to sign with SA as an UDFA.  2016 Draft was on June 23, Bryn signed with SA's summer league team on the 24th and then signed to the main club after SL in mid July."
Bryn Forbes type of vibe
"That gives you a chance at a title if the other teams get injured  Jimmy Butler is also hot and cold, if he plays worse than Bryn Forbes there is no chance at a title, he needs to get a more consistent shots in the playoffs rather than rely on free throws"
"He wouldn't be able to play heavy minutes against starters but having a guy who can keep your bench offense at least running and treading water is so huge. I mean, shit, Bryn Forbes played 100 minutes against the Nets - bet you the Bucks would've loved for Lou to be getting those minutes."
"If you could get the players to buy into a 1 v 1 tourney it'd be incredible, but I could see it going the other way too if players didn't care and then you watch like patty Mills vs Bryn Forbes or something."
What the point of potentially hitting 2 or 3 3s a game if ur just gonna be so ass on D that you give it right back  There‚Äôs a reason Bryn Forbes didn‚Äôt play in the finals
"His defense would get exposed by every single starting point guard in the league, much in the same way every single 2-guard exposed Bryn the year he had to start for us -- and i mean EVERY last 2 guard took it personal when guarded by Forbes."
"Don‚Äôt wanna depend on the rookie that hard tho. Let he and Bryn Forbes go at it in practice and what not, then maybe by the all star break, he starts to take some of Forbes minutes. Ease him into it"
"I'm salty about all the downvoters who downvoted me in the previous thread because I called Bryn Forbes out for what he is - a self-centered player who cares more about himself than being part of a winning team, or anything that is bigger than him. I'll accept more downvoters now.  [Previous Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/osojn6/wojnarowski_espn_sources_milwaukee_bucks_guard/h6qvfj5/?context=3)"
Have you seen Bryn Forbes shooting against the Nets? He's a super streaky shooter who is more often off than he is on.
no disrespect Bryn Forbes looks like a cabbage patch doll all due respect
"Bargain shooters are still shooters. Bryn Forbes was a bargain shooter. He can't even defend a guy who has no arms and legs, but he can shoot.  Marco Belinelli wasn't even in the league this year, and is an even worse defender than Bryn...but he can shoot."
I actually think he‚Äôs going to end up on the Knicks. Brooklyn is apparently rumored to be interested in Bryn Forbes for that role
"Bryn Forbes won't be missed too much, Jordan nwora will probably take his minutes. We'll probably keep pj, Bobby is most likely gone tho, his minutes probably go to diakite/toupane"
bryn forbes
I look at Bryn Forbes.  He had a great couple games in the playoffs then became unplayable but he is going to get a significant amount of money this offseason.
"I wonder if they could get Duncan Robinson, Melo and or Bobby Portis or even trade for someone like Bryn Forbes."
"PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are all free agents tho"
"bryn forbes murdered miami and got benched against phoenix. No point in having a good shooter is they're a turnstile on defense, ask utah."
A tall Bryn Forbes on a terrible contract. Teams are going to ask for assets back to take that on.
nba champion Bryn Forbes is a FA
"They likely can only fill out the roster with veteran minimum contracts, G leaguers, and the tax payer MLE. That means players have to take a pay cut or get marginal players at best.   Bryn Forbes, Torrey Craig, McDermott, McConell, Bullock, Malik Monk, and Wes Mathews are examples.  It would likely be a thin roster at best when it comes to shooting.  I think the Buddy Hield play makes more sense if the Lakers keep KCP and their pick."
Bryn Forbes is going elsewhere. I'd expect Bobby Portis to look to get paid. And the Bucks seem destined to look for another stretch-four to replace him.
"That's how this business works. He may or may not have been shilling for LAC but almost everything Woj and Shams do are shilling for someone...an agent, a front office executive, or a player. Woj and Shams accumulate debts for breaking news throughout the season and then pay back their sources during the draft, free agency and the trade deadline. Always think about who the tweet benefits and it'll all make much more sense.  Look at this tweet, it's Woj unnecessarily touting Bryn Forbes going into free agency. Bryn Forbes' agent also reps Jokic and Middleton, is Woj a Forbes super fan or just tweeting this in exchange for access to the agent's stars?  [https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1420036924631396353](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1420036924631396353)  Or this one claiming that Detroit is still undecided about Cunningham and still evaluating Mobley and Green. Like what? This is either Mobley's agent building up his stock or Detroit wink-winking that they are open to a trade and trying to invite offers.  https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1419740902810083329"
I guess Bryn Forbes is better than James Harden. He has a ring
You‚Äôd love Bryn Forbes then
"Ellington was a bit of a paradox last year - too good to be on a tanking team, not quite good enough to contribute meaningful minutes on a contender.  As a Pistons fan, I hope he finds a spot on a championship roster. His leadership was a big factor in keeping our rookies engaged.  Milwaukee may be looking for a veteran guard given Bryn Forbes declining his option? Or one of the Los Angeles teams."
Bryn Forbes punching the air rn
Should slot right in for Bryn Forbes then?
"Yes, he is better than Bryn Forbes by a pretty good margin at this point in their careers , that isnt worth energy. Joe Harris is a good comp, Buddy is marginally better (Buddy is asked to do more than he should be doing and is taking 4 more 3PA a game than Joe), and he is marginally payed more than Joe is. A lot of these guys take hometown discounts to win a title. A guy like Joe Ingles could get paid 3-4 more a year if he wanted to play on a less loaded team. JJ Reddick made 23 million in 2017 for putting up Hield like numbers. When that immediately fell off he regressed to a lower tiered mean (to be fair he was nearing the end of his prime that season alone)."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  First off, I'm not directly comparing Wiggins and Hield, only pointing out that they're similar in that they have value but they are overpaid.  Second, are you saying that Hield is some unicorn as one of ""only about 5 or 6"" players of his caliber from 3 (and I guess midrange)?  How is he different than Joe Harris besides being a bit smaller and a bit worse of a shooter?  [https://stathead.com/tiny/CRa3Q](https://stathead.com/tiny/CRa3Q).  Is he much better than Bryn Forbes (also a shoot only SG)?  Anthony ""48 is my % from 3 and minutes on the bench in the playoffs"" Morrow?  I think you're way overrating Hield because he hasn't been relentlessly exposed in the playoffs on defense, in large part because he's eating up $20m/year and playing bad D."
"Ah hes using the infamous Kd shoe argument. It seems he is admitting he has no real response and is salty the team that swept you won a chip while jimmy ""outscored by bryn forbes"" butler will never get one."
You dont think pausing the season for a long ass time right before the playoffs then moving to a bubble where players cant see families/have their entire daily routines changed affected playoff performance? heat fans are delusional. Either way the bucks exposed jimmy and bam this year and got the chip so it doesnt really matter what happened in the bubble. Bryn forbes scored more points than your best player in the playoffs so you have more important things to worry about.
"Looks like I can't edit the post because it's past 40000 characters, so here's the Detroit team  \*\*point guard\*\*|\*\*shooting guard\*\*|\*\*small forward\*\*|\*\*power forward\*\*|\*\*center\*\*   :--|:--|:--|:--|:--   monte morris|devin booker|miles bridges|draymond green|javale mcgee   \*killian hayes\*|bryn forbes|josh jackson|kyle kuzma|xavier tillman sr.   edmond sumner|\*sviatoslav mykhailiuk\*|jae'sean tate|\*sekou doumbouya\*|\*aron baynes\*   mychal mulder|dakota mathias|denzel valentine|‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ   cassius winston|\*deividas sirvydis\*|brian bowen|‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ"

If he was the true GOAT he would‚Äôve run a lineup of 5 Bryn Forbes to the championship
"Booker for sure. Bryn Forbes outscored him, we exposed how bad of a shooter he actually is, could have beat then last year if we disrespected him the same way.  Jimmy is also old and doesn't have an mcl, same thing that caused Wade to drop off a cliff. People saying he dropped 40, those days are probably way behind him."
Yes I remember Bryn Forbes specifically locking up Jimmy Butler
All I‚Äôm gonna say is Jimmy Butler was outplayed by Bryn Forbes
Booker for sure. He didn't get outscored by bryn forbes in the finals
They kind of already did have guys taking paycuts to join them. Bobby Portis said he took a discount to go to Milwaukee. Bryn Forbes probably could've signed for more than a minimum somewhere.
"1. Re-sign Thanasis to keep Giannis happy  2. Re-sign Tucker with bird rights because the other option is he walks for nothing   3. The Bryn Forbes role now belongs to Jordan Nwora  4. Offer Bobby a 1+1 TPMLE with a nod nod wink wink that a four year early bird contract is coming up. Salary is then $5,890,000; $10,307500; $11,132,100; $12,022,688; $12,984,481. That‚Äôs at least competitive with a full MLE.   5. Donte is coming back  6. Move on from Jeff Teague and look for some Horst Magic from a ring chasing vet at backup PG  Giannis, Khris, Jrue, Brook, Donte  Bobby, PJ, Pat, Nwora, Not Jeff Teague  Diakite, Sam, Thanos, 31, Open slot for a buyout"
"Bryn Forbes is really small, but if he can play his way into more minutes per game, he could definitely average a 12/3/3 stat line for an entire regular season."
Run it back is the best option but if they making a move it should be adding one more danny green/wes matthews back or something but tbh I wouldn't want them bc that would remove donte and connaughton mins so I would rather get a pg that's not a liability on defence a la bryn forbes and can also shoot
"It's really hard to upgrade on Bryn Forbes in a point guard when you only have a MLE.  Similarly, there are about twenty teams that are looking to hire shooters ..."
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
"Each of the Bucks acquisitions had a big role in each series: - Bryn literaly-better-than-Steph-against-the-Heat Forbes was great in the first series - PJ Tucker was huge against the Nets - Jrue was great all playoff long defensively, but against the Hawks he closed it out on offense, as well - Bobby Portis was great in game 6  Can't ask for more than that, really."
"The average NFL career length is 3 years. The average NBA career length is 4 years. Not much difference.  Tom Brady has played 301 games in his career. Lebron has played 1310 games. The latter is far more taxing even if football is a harsher sport. I'm not even including playoff games, all-star games, Olympics etc. Lebron has played for entire calendar years Jan-Dec while never has. Tom Brady only plays one side of the field before getting a rest on defense. Bryn Forbes is a DPOY compared to Tom Brady.  Lebron is running, stopping, running, jumping, stopping, running etc. non-stop for a thousand more games than Brady is."
"Or, conversely, a Gucci store version of Bryn Forbes."
Bazemore averaged more points than PJ Tucker or Bryn Forbes on the Bucks. You use what you have.
"Bryn Forbes - Game 2 Miami  Brook Lopez -  Game 4 Miami, Game 5 Atlanta  Khris Middleton - Game 3 Brooklyn, Game 6 Brooklyn, Game 3 Atlanta, Game 6 Atlanta, Game 4 Phoenix  Giannis - Game 4 Brooklyn, Game 7 Brooklyn, basically the entire Finals  Jrue - Game 6 Atlanta, Game 5 Phoenix  And that's with just focusing on box scores and focusing on one guy per game unless there were two or more legitimately stellar performances. Add in major plays on defense and things that don't show up on the box score, and I think that list expands to cover basically everyone that saw meaningful play time."
Bryn Forbes had significant contribution with his treys. He earned his piece of the trophy.
"Improve the bench in a variety of ways. Namely, getting a bucket getter that isn‚Äôt just a spot up shooter (see Bryn Forbes). I think the perfect player to fill this role would be Terrence Ross, and he should be easy to get from the Magic since he doesn‚Äôt fit their timeline. Bench defense could also be improved, since their only serviceable wings off the bench are Tucker (if Donte is healthy) and Connaughton. A Brook Lopez trade could also be a good option to bring in multiple role players to fill out the bench, since Bobby Portis/Giannis at the 5 lineups proved successful in these playoffs."
Yep. Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes were both very good 3P shooters in the regular season (3rd and 4th in the NBA in 3P%) but it didn't translate when the stakes were raised.
"Yeah, Bryn Forbes is apparently not a reliable playoff shooting threat.  It's amazing how we were able to survive shooting so poorly even if the Nets were injured.  In that series, I believe our 3P% on wide-open shots actually got worse if you removed the Giannis 3P attempts."
The Bucks won a title! Bryn Forbes can have his jersey retired for all I care!
"It's cause you are ignoring the Bucks side where they lost their starter, Donte DiVincenzo, which led to more Jeff Teague and Bryn Forbes minutes than they should've gotten"
Bryn Forbes. And the heat simply didn't show up.   Genuinely happy Giannis got his title though.
As a Spurs fan I can't believe Bryn fucking Forbes is an NBA champion.
Bryn Forbes &gt; Steph Curry
Bryn Forbes?
"Congrats to all Bucks fans for this incredible achievement.   So happy for Giannis getting this money off his back, but more importantly I'm happy for former Spurs assistant coach Bud and former Spur Bryn Forbes."

Is Bryn Forbes hurt?
Bucks need some Bryn Forbes shooting
bryn forbes must be garbage in practice if he's not gtetting any minutes over teague
I'm going to laugh if this becomes something weird like a Cam Johnson versus Bryn Forbes shootout.
"I think the series just showed his limitations. Going against strong defenders in Giannis and Jrue and then running into Brooke repeatedly in the paint showed that Jimmy ultimately couldn't create any shots or offense and was left to pass out to Duncan Robinson and Bam. He doesnt have much to his offensive game, and everything suffers if he can't get into the paint or get to the line. He got outscored by Bryn Forbes, and I dont think it's because of luck. The Heat had no answer for the Bucks size and ultimately had to settle for tough shots, which they couldn't make."
can't tell if bryn forbes or michael jordan
Where were you when the ‚ÄúBryn Forbes‚Äù game happened?

Bryn Forbes
"We had Bryn Forbes last year, Davis Bertans, Kawhi, Danny Green, a couple years before that.  Derrick White has upped his 3pa rate, but was hurt most of the season. We still have Patty and Rudy Gay shot more 3s this year.  Pop coaches to his players strengths and by the end of the year our 2 best players in DeMar and DJ both don't shoot many 3s. Remember we started the year with LMA who had started shooting 3s a little into the 19-20 season."
Good insight. The Spurs defense has gotten a lot better without Bryn Forbes too.

Also Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes are massive upgrades over guys like Marvin Williams and Kyle Korver.

who needs curry when you have bryn forbes
Bryn forbes just getting eaten alive for free threes from ariza lol
Youdont want to see Bryn Forbes on Kyrie that would end badly
"If Bryn Forbes has to guard Kyrie Irving, then Kyrie is going to score 120 points a game"
"""Alexa, is Bryn Forbes a good defender?"""
Plus Joe Harris is 6-6 with a high release point and relatively unbothered by contests. How is 6-2 Bryn Forbes supposed to really bother him?
"Yup, my sentiments as well. For Bucks, who the hell is gonna stop Jrue Holiday? KCP can't stop him, and I doubt Schroeder will either. If you put AD on Giannis, and Bron on Middleton, and either Gasol/Drummond on Brooke Lopez. Now that Divenzo is out for playoffs, Bryn Forbes is gonna probably start and that mofo can shoot lights out. I ain't gonna lie, I'm rooting for Lakers, but hope they get Nets rather than Bucks, because Nets defense is not on par with Bucks."
"Bryn Forbes is unplayable against the Nets unless Kyrie and Harden are both on the bench. They are both way too good at hunting mismatches, he will get murdered."
Bryn Forbes and Planet Pat will see more minutes for sure.  Maybe Jeff Teague gets a few now too in non-blowouts.  Jesus take the wheel.
Bryn Forbes
"his defense is needed for the nets. you think a rotation of holiday, Bryn Forbes and pat connaughton are gonna stop Kyrie and harden?"
well this is no beuno.... guard depth is already not great on this roster... Were gonna have to put Bryn Forbes on Kyrie....
Bryn Forbes
Bryn Forbes
and 3 of those 5 players are all Bryn Forbes
"Idk, there are always some dumb takes here, but in the playoffs it gets cranked up to max because the games are so much more important. People love to talk about one playoff game like it changes everything we know about the league, so a few playoff games may as well mean Jesus himself came down from heaven and told us ‚ÄúThis is the real truth nephews, Jae Crowder is TRASH‚Äù. How can it not be true after a 3 game sample size?  It‚Äôs similar to how after game 1, one of the top comments about Bryn Forbes post game was something like ‚ÄúBut Spurs fans told me he was trash‚Äù like him making some open 3‚Äôs in one game means he is clearly a good player. Sometimes guys make shots, sometimes they miss shots. You‚Äôll learn a whole lot more about someone‚Äôs actual shooting ability from regular season stats, ESPECIALLY when most of their shots are just catch and shoot"
"The Bucks would have to pray he takes the MLE, of which I think the Bucks are limited to the taxpayer (around $5.8M). I could see Bobby joining the Pelicans this summer, but I think he (and Bryn Forbes, whose option is for just above the minimum) is gone"
Not everyone can be a Bryn Forbes
"we want to contend now, we just got hella unlucky with the dipo trade, giannis reupping, herro slumping, the unfavorable 1st round matchup with the bucks, bryn forbes going nuclear, jimmy bricking wide open layups for the first two games, middleton making a contested fadeaway to win game 1, etc. If even just one of these things fell our way the narrative would be different right now."
How are the Heat going to let Bryn Forbes clown them like he‚Äôs prime Kobe?
Don‚Äôt forget about Bobby P and bryn Forbes!
"I was already dreading Bobby going somewhere else for big money next year, now I gotta worry about Bryn Forbes too?"

YOU CANNOT STOP BRYN FORBES YOU CAN ONLY HOPE TO CONTAIN HIM
Lowry would have prevented Bryn Forbes shooting out of his mind  last game. Easy.

Heat fans are gonna be checking under their bed for Bryn Forbes.
Seeing Bryn Forbes light the Heat up is giving me Danny Green ‚Äò13-‚Äò14 vibes
Gary Nea-- I meant Bryn Forbes
"You mean Bryn Forbes, right?"
Bryn Forbes.
TIL Julio Jones likes Bryn Forbes from SAS lmao
"Man either I‚Äôm just extremely tired or you‚Äôre just being confusing lol  No offense to the Sixers because they are extremely talented but I don‚Äôt think they have enough scorers to keep Up with the Nets aside from Tobias and Embiid. Curry and Green can get hot though so I wouldn‚Äôt exactly be surprised.   But with the bucks Giannis will get his plus some as shown in all 3 games against the Nets. Every game he‚Äôs had 35+ pts including the 49. Play we have Jrue and Khris who both could easily score 20+. Lopez can be good on most nights and if Donte gets hot he can add 15+ and same with Bryn and Forbes. Plus we have damn good defense as shown in these last two Heat games. What happened in game 2 against Miami wasn‚Äôt the first time that‚Äôs happened this season and with the Nets defense I could see that possibly happening again especially when we take it to Milwaukee. But who knows, Nets are extremely offensively talented.   Glad to see a Nets fan not automatically assuming you guys have won it all already.   I would favor the bucks over the sixers against the Nets but again I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Sixers did decent against the Nets either."
"Mostly missing Bryn Forbes, Kyle Anderson, and Boban."
Bryn Forbes aka sleepy Steph is going to torch everyone
