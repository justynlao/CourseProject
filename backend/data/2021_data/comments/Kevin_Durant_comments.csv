Kevin Durant is the best basketball player in the NBA
Kevin Durant is a good basketball player
That would be Kevin Durant.
&gt; Nets: Absolutely. Kevin fucking Durant  He must be freakin' exhausted. And surely the Bucks figure out the Nets have no one else that can hurt them right now and send some doubles at KD. Right? Right?
Hawks: 50/50  Clippers: Absolutely. Ty Lue knows how to attack Utah  Nets: Absolutely. Kevin fucking Durant
Can we get a Paul George vs. Kevin Durant finals with their star teammates on the shelf and watch this sub spontaneously self-combust?
"That’s a fair point for sure. However, you have to take into account that the Bucks had to play against Kevin Durant who is pretty good too."
Because he had Klay thompson Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on his team?
"An athletic Draymond Green just not as strong mentally as Draymond Green in the playoffs. Draymond Green was  in perfect situation with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson with their shooting to provide space for Draymond to set screens over and over (at their peak some said moving screens), rebound, pass the ball, and maybe score to yell ""AND 1"". The scoring is provided by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and later Kevin Durant on offense. In playoffs most of teams are good at finding other team weaknesses and exploiting them until the team can make adjustments. Draymond Green isn't a good scorer, and Warriors were able hide that weakness most of the time where it wouldn't be detrimental."
"Kevin Durant is still Kevin Durant, and harden is coming back. The Nets should still be favorites for the east"
Cus they had a huge lead and they weren’t playing Kevin Durant
"Lmao, reminds me of people saying The Golden State Warriors and Kevin Durant."
At least the bucks lost to Kevin Durant
Bojan “Kevin Durant” Bogdonavic
"To the Buck's credit, they played against an absolute monster that is Kevin Durant and couldn't adjust well."
This cant be topped. At least the Bucks were against Kevin fucking Durant.
"Not just Kevin Durant, but arguably the greatest Kevin Durant performance of his entire career."
Yes I believe players get worse when tired  Unless ur name is Kevin Wayne Durant and you drop a 50 point triple double without a break
"And to the hawks, who don't have fucking Kevin Durant"
The bucks can at least tell themselves they didn’t have the best player on the floor and only lost cus Kevin Durant went god mode (even though it’s not true)
No its the Sixers easily. Bucks lost to Kevin Durant having his best game ever.
"Sixers, Bucks at least lost to an otherworldly performance from Kevin Durant."
"sixers easily  led by more  lost to the 5 seed  bucks lost to kevin durant, sixers lost to trae. trae is a damn good player but he ain’t kd"
Sixers because there's nobody on the Hawks named Kevin Durant.
"Sixers. Atlanta is a far worse team, it was in Philly, and Kevin Durant doesn’t play for the Hawks."
"kevin durant is an asshole, we all know this is true, but at least when his team needed it, he played all 48 minutes. We all know bitchmade paul george wont do any such thing."
"Bucks choked yesterday no two ways around it. Bad.  But they choked against one of the all time playoff performances from Kevin Durant, and up 17 is a lot, but it's not 25 points either.  Sixers just choked a 25 point lead against the HAWKS."
"We’re all feeling weird things this playoffs. I for one never thought I’d be so nostalgic for Kevin Durant, yet here I am."
"Second half comebacks from double digits  aren't that uncommon,especially if the other team has Kevin Durant. Comebacks when up by 26 late in the 3rd? You gotta really suck for that to happen."
KEVIN DURANT WHO??????
At least we lost to kevin durant not trae young lmaooo
"Dude that was like a shot of Vicodin, Giannis’ pain is all gone, but he still has to deal with Kevin Durant lol."
Bucks fans at least have the excuse of having to face Kevin fucking Durant
They really just lost to a kid that sounds like he’s 14 years old in this postgame interview. At least the Bucks can tell themselves they only lost cus Kevin Durant went god mode
Kevin Durant was to me was worst player oat who could barely dribble without 2 superstars next to him and game 5 convinced me that he is pretty decent
Plus using the screens only should’ve made it easier for the Bucks to trap. I don’t care who gets left open I’m not letting KD be comfortable whether it’s using the screen to get down hill or just using it to create a mismatch.  Like instead of Brook Lopez playing drop coverage against Kevin fucking Durant he should’ve been up to help trap. Figure out the rotations and everything else later.
"Unfortunately, the hawks don’t have a kevin durant to drop 49 points and make this game worth watching"
"Huerter Stat line 0-7, 0 rebounds, 0 assist, -20, a clear path foul    We had Kevin Durant all Time great game last night. Tonight is the huerter low"
"Honestly, this is embarassing and stupid.   Do you really think you're going to make up a 20 point deficit with this strategy? Especially with 5 minutes still left to go in the FIRST HALF?  You're not coming back unless you can air drop Kevin Durant into the building."
"Lol that might be one of the only things my wife knows about basketball. I'll bring up Kevin Durant and she is just like ""is he still cursed?"""
Something Kevin Durant should have embraced.
Renamed my cat Kevin Durant and hugged her.
The same argument that keeps popping up between Kevin Durant and James Harden lol.
"How did you just call this dude's analogy garbage and then agree with him in the same sentence? You realize in his analogy, the Bucks are the handler and the Nets are the tiger right? They got careless with Kevin fucking Durant and he bit their fucking head off."
"Melo shot 5.1 threes this year, that's already pretty high.   For example Kevin Durant shot 5.4 this year and averages 4.9 attempts for a career.  Plus Lamelos game is more about fastbreaks, driving and making plays in the paint."
I don’t care how bad the other team has played if you have 1 possession with the shotclock off tied and Kevin Durant has the ball they are more likely to win. Not like Bud tried to get it out of his hands
Kevin Durant wasn't sweating or even breathing hard in the post game interview. Slim Reaper looked like he could have played another game right then. That thing I saw last night was absolutely NUTS.
That was when I just knew that they weren’t going to win despite Nets being down in that first half.   They were doubling and at times even tripling one legged James Harden. Like wtf are they thinking lol. Force the guy with *one bad leg* to beat you not KEVIN DURANT lol
Kevin Durant probably would have been 1st team if he played more games.
"I didn't say nobody was allowed to talk about it, I said its the latest circlejerk (among many as there is basically a fresh one after every game) and it definitely is a circlejerk when there's 50 threads about how he's a bad coach and like 3 comments across all of them actually giving an example of him not being up to the task. And almost all of them use hyperbolic language like calling him a ""fraud"" or whatever nonsense. How many other coaches struggle in the playoffs then eventually make it to the top? What about guys that won with stacked teams and haven't since?  If he's bad at adjustments, that's a fine and valid criticsm, but we don't have to pretend like he didn't overachieve on those Hawks teams and then actually take the Bucks to the next level from Kidd and co. In Milwaukee he lost to the champion Raptors and the ECF winning Heat, its not like they're losing to bad teams. This Nets team isn't some joke either. Even in a game where he arguably had ""without a doubt one of the worst coaching performances in recent playoff memory"" you still needed Kevin Durant, one of the greatest players of all time, to go off and put up one of the highest rated playoff performances of all time.  I'm saying there's a line between Saying Bud is Overrated or getting Outcoached and calling him a Fraud or comparing him to *LUKE WALTON* of all people."
"No, Pau didn't play at 2010 World Championship. He cited the same reason of Jokic withdrawing. I was bitter of not seeing him play at Turkey. Even people thought here some of the players did not want to come here to play (bad image?) Fortunately Kevin Durant was there. But otherwise, you are right. To this day Spaniards ambition is amazing."
"Bros, find someone who will hug you the way Steve Nash hugs Kevin Durant"
"&gt;Are Embiid and Jokic not skilled because they're huge? Embiid has great post moves, can shoot the mid-range, and can shoot the 3 well. Jokic is a great shooter and one of the best passers the league has ever seen.   Are you in the habit of putting up strawmen?  &gt;No fucking shit them being huge plays a part in it but it's that in combination with their skill that make them so great.   Is it no fucking shit? Seems like lots of people are objecting to the comparison. I'm just saying what took Shaq from great to one of the best is his size. I actually never said Shaq had no skill. No clue why that's controversial. If Kevin Durant was 6 foot, would he be as good a scorer? Probably not. If Kawhi Leonard didnt have enormous hands, would his defence be as good?"
"There is a case that some basketball people will make that says not to do it.  Giannis' lateral movement isn't nearly as good as some people think it is, especially in relation to Kevin Durant.  KD \*loves drawing fouls\*. Giannis \*loves fouling\*.  It's not something you can do for 40 minutes because Giannis will be fouled out after 20, but as a different look when KD is going that hard you have to try."
"Paul George would have to be Kevin Durant to win a game.   Mitchell has an ankle injury you can play through that. You still have a deep team.   The Clippers don't even have a point guard outside of Rondo who hasn't played the series. Kawhi and PG are the are almost the entirety of their creation, playmaking and defense. They don't have anything to replace what Kawhi does."
Also Kevin Durant
PG would need to be Kevin Durant to win a game. The series is not within his expectations.
"Yes, pj Tucker wasn't physical enough on Kevin Durant."
Apparently Kevin Durant has changed the balance of the universe with his performance.  Don't be surprised to see Yannis go down with turf toe or something silly.
"Kevin Durant has been the best player in the world since 2016  Take 2020 like 1994 for Michael Jordan, he wasn’t playing so it’s not much of a strike against him"
"He might be a little laterally faster than giannis yeah, but then he loses on height, and with KDs shooting, that's not better.   It doesn't matter who it is, when Kds cooking 1 on 1 coverage just isn't effective. The only effective ways teams have to slow him down is to immediately double, and/or keep him away from his spots. The mid-range from the right wing or baseline, anything near the top of the three point line... If he gets the ball there and has enough space or time to get a move off, goodnight. For the defense to be effective on Kevin durant, it has to be in his face before he has the ability to decide what he wants to do."
PJ was literally the best defender against KD in their last game. In playoff games you go with your best bet/safest call u don’t just try new stuff and switch it up mid game you go with what has worked (and let’s be honest it’s Kevin Durant one of the most unguardable players we’ve we’ve ever seen what defense is gonna affect him when he’s hot?)
"That team vs  Trae young, DEvin booker, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Gobert"
[KD last May](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2891724-nets-kevin-durant-on-positive-covid-19-test-im-alive-thats-itim-good)   [Westbrook](https://www.nba.com/news/russell-westbrook-says-he-tested-positive-coronavirus)  [Donovan Mitchell](https://www.nba.com/news/donovan-mitchell-interview-says-asymptomatic)
"Milwaukee wet the bed last night, and that deserves attention, but Kevin Durant had one of the greatest performances anyone's ever seen in the playoffs and that deserves attention too."
Kevin Durant drops 60 in game 6.
Kevin Durant?
Play like Kevin Durant.
"But (a) we’ve seen this team fold under pressure so many times before (b) there’s no way Harden plays this poorly again and (c) he’s Kevin Durant, who are you to say he can’t do this again."
This.  Kevin *”y’all know who I am”* Durant
How tf is KEVIN FUCKING DURANT the most resilient star in these playoffs??? Everybody falling like flies and this brother goes for 48 minutes lol
Kevin Durant just woke up with a woody. ￼
"People just need to accept that Westbrook is a guy who can carry your team into the playoffs but won't win you Series once you are there. He's played with Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden and Bradley Beal throughout his career. Dude just isn't a Championship caliber player in a major leading role."
Bro we’re talking about Kevin Durant. I’m honestly expecting a 60 point game on 60% shooting in one of games 6 or 7
"But that would imply Kevin Durant is only second best, as great white sharks are absolutely terrified of Orcas, who are bigger, stronger, and more intelligent than them. Coincidentally, LeBron sounds like the Orca lol"
Good post I agree with you on most of it but Draymon Green and Kevin Durant both had good seasons after covid.
asking Kevin Durant to play like Kevin Durant is too much to ask for? Even if you hate the guy you have to admit he can easily put up 40 again if he wants to lol
God damn do I miss having Kevin Durant on my team. I hate him. But I miss him.
Soo....WHERE IS KEVIN DURANT?????
"I think that’s incredibly reductive and in many ways just not true. you seem comfortable saying that bc we agree that he’s a better isolation scorer but there’s more to offense than that. yes Kevin Durant can score over anyone but he’s not the only one in the league who is a walking bucket. Steph Curry warps defenses in a way that Durant simply doesn’t. as I’ve said he has a gravity that KD doesn’t quite possess which makes things easier for his teammates. His efficiency is better than perhaps anyone else in the entire existence of the league and most importantly the warriors were much better when it was Curry without Durant vs Durant without curry and that speaks to how valuable steph was on offense since he’s a net neutral/negative on defense. as for your remark about ballhandling, yes guards tend to be better ballhandlers bc guards tend to be better offensive players overall. So I do think Steph being a better balllhandler is something to consider especially since KD does benefit from being 7ft and having a good handle himself."
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
"This is my kind of post season. Kawhi out for the series, cp3 out indefinitely, Harden playing hurt, Irving out, Embiid playing hurt, nuggets missing their second best player, Conley out, the bucks relatively healthy but still being the bucks, and DeAndre hunter out for the post season.  Can't wait for the finals, where the Clippers (led by Ivica Zubac) will face the nets (led by the corpse Kevin Durant being propped up by his teammates, weekend at  berneys style) for the chip."
Why are people pretending Kevin Durant still isn't a problem and the series isn't 2-2 with the clippers?
"Man chill, Kevin Durant alone with that nets team can beat the hawks. Who on the hawks is stopping him from scoring 50 every game lol"
"There are obviously things they could have done better, but the answer is Kevin Durant."

What they gotta worry about is controlling Kevin Durant
KEVIN “WHO CANT LEAD WHAT?” DURANT!   All jokes aside though amazing performance by KD. Came out and punched the critics &amp; Bucks square in the mouth.
Kevin Durant is a grown man
"Was surprised I had to come this far down to find a Durant compliment. Well, not really. Not in this sub. Everything above is just 'Bucks so dumb!'. While that may be true- Kevin Durant had as a good a game tonight as he has ever had. One of the best playoff performances of all time."
"Well I’m assuming he doesnt want Giannis to pick up fouls and/or expend his energy bar playing both sides. Also KD can tear up Giannis from anywhere. Kevin Durant is unstoppable at times, so it doesnt really matter who the defender is."

How is Kevin Durant not on this list?
So what you are saying is at one point Kevin Durant was a -15.
"Bro, we're not trading Kuzma for Kevin Durant straight up. Maybe if the Nets add in a couple first round picks or something."
"""DEATH AND DESTRUCTION...as Kevin Durant lights up the Bucks in a basketball game."""
You can love him or hate him. But you have to respect Kevin Durant for doing what a top 5 player should do.  Put your team on your back and carry across the finish line.  Real interesting to see what the Bucks do.  That's a tough game to lose after being up for essentially 3 quarters.  I feel like the coaching could have been better for them last night as well.  Too late to make adjustments and in some cases no answers for the Nets.
Kevin Durant is probably the best offensive player of all time
"Its one of those ""I'm Kevin Durant"" game"
"KD is a better scorer, shoots more efficiently from the three, from mid-range, from inside, from the free-throw line, a better playmaker, a better rebounder, and a better time protector and you're out here saying it's laughable to say KD is better? Stop it. Kawhi is a better perimeter defender. That is literally the only thing he is better at that KD. KD just dropped 49 which is more than kawhi Leonard has ever scored. As a matter of fact.. Leonard has three 40 point games, Kevin Durant has over 60 while missing a substantial time with various injuries throughout his career. So really, if you really want to look at it.. it's laughable to say that Kawhi Leonard is better"
Kevin Fucking Durant is the difference.
"&gt; If we're emphasizing lowlights, Harden has lost to SA in the 2nd round when they were missing their best player.  bruh you're conflating an issue we both agree on: harden and Durant have both had massive choking series' in the post season lol   &gt;KD put up 30ppg on 65ts%  Exactly which fits my narrative nicely:he can shoot well in single coverage *but he doesn't make his teammates better because of his lack of playmaking, basketball intelligence, and ball handling* which is evidenced by them getting absolutely throttled in 5 games lol  &gt;has James ever led a team to the finals?  No. But harden didn't take the easy way out even though curry smoked him every year since 2015 *unlike Kevin Durant*  &gt;This isn't going well for you.  Ya sure thing buddy"
"Chris Paul denies player option, signs with BKN on vet min. BKN signs Drummond to vet min, Dinwiddies returns from injury. Imagine that   James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Andre Drummond  Bench mob:  CP3  Dinwiddie  Bruce Brown  Blake Griffin  Claxton     the dankest timeline"
Kevin Durant and it’s not even remotely close
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win basketball team.
Let me introduce you to Kevin Durant
&gt; So why didn't Westbrook keep creating beyond the first round after KD left?  Um not sure what you're getting at here (Durant hasn't done anything in OKC with Westbrook out lol) but if you're implying that OKC was the same minus Kevin Durant post 2016 you're not being honest.   Why did KD pull the weakest move in all of sports history by joining a 73 win team with the league MVP in his prime? Why did he join that same team after getting his ass handed to him by the reigning MVP who just came off an injury that the doctors would say would take months to heal?  This entire interaction just goes to show that WB gets way more slander than Durant and its entirely unwarranted. WB didn't join the 73 win team. Durant did. and that's what we call a chicken shit move
"&gt;	Durant isn't a playmaker. That's not his position. He's not a guard.   Ah ya let’s just forget lebron james, Larry bird, KAJ, Kevin Garnett, the all time great playmakers who were guards, ya. No it’s about usage: how does the player *play.*   &gt;	Durant was always the primary option. OKC would be nowhere without him.  Not in GS he was ....*checks notes* ....**third** in time with the ball, dribbles per possession, passes completed, etc behind Draymond green then number one Curry. How is he the primary option but doesn’t even have the ball for the *second* most possessions on the team?   I won’t get into OKC other than WB was the de facto ball handler and creator."
"&gt;	Hou frankly wanted KD to go off even if he did so rather efficiently.  The rockets forced Durant to isolate because he’s too stubborn to be a secondary option to Curry (which he was *anytime* they shared the court together). This is something he has admitted. Guess what it did? It took a chris paul hamstring injury for them to pull through because *curry can work with or without the ball*. Kevin Durant cannot.   I think the teling story is that Durant is what we call a “system” player. He can’t create at a high level, can’t be a primary ball handler, can’t get out of traps and doubles, can’t win at all *unless he has an all time great guard creating for him*  It sucks because Durant could have proved himself in Brooklyn but now that harden is there he’ll once again evade the responsibility of being the primary option"
"This is really true and it reminds me of something I once said ""The idea of Kevin Durant being the GOAT scorer is better than the actual reality of it"". Obviously incredible player, top 20 player in NBA history, but we project certain characteristics onto him because of how unique he is and how effortless it looks for him and how unstoppable a 6'11 shooter is when he's on.   He doesnt floor raise like other offensive superstars. So then there's the idea of being super scalable which I talked about and yes its true. But even then.....I watched both GSW/Hou series very closely. [you saw so much of this in the KD/Steph era](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201805160HOU.html) KD goes off but it doesnt matter if the defense contains Steph that's all that matters. He didnt necessarily fit in as perfectly with GSW as it always appeared there was more opportunity cost to getting him going that it seemed. Hou frankly wanted KD to go off even if he did so rather efficiently.   And it comes back to this for me: KD can operate in a way where he gets a super efficient 35 but where it doesnt actually truly compromise or stress your defense. It doesnt prevent you from still being able to defend his team the way you want even if you cant stop KD to a degree that isnt as true for other superstars. Everything you said is right, he's not super committed consistently to stuff like moving off ball, setting screens, playmaking etc.  I think part of this is we always framed the convo as LeBron vs KD, ""KD coming for LeBron's throne"" etc. It's part of why even if I think KD&gt;Harden still overall people have probably overstated the gap between the two as one ex."
"Imagine having to be a Brooklyn fan right now, what an absolutely embarrassing group of players put together.   Kevin ""Lemme just join the best team so I can check this box"" Durant  James ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas, I give up"" Harden  Kyrie ""I'm an Actual Genius"" Irving  Blake ""Detriot? More like Deez Nuts, lemme know when the game is over"" Griffin  Thank god for the people of NY the Knicks are playing well right now."
You know Kevin Durant exists right? Kyrie? Curry? PG? They all have far better footwork.
"Theres that video of Kevin Durant playing a bunch of non pros at some huge park and he's the biggest and strongest dude out there clearly. You'd think these 5'10, 6'2 guys are quicker but then on one of the fast breaks it looks like KD teleports to the net he's going so fast. So you realize that not only is he the biggest, strongest guy but he's also by far the fastest and he's also shooting like 80% from anywhere. That guy should go pro."
"The 2020 Rockets didn't have a player like Kevin Durant who has won 2 Finals MVPs, and is the most efficient player in NBA Finals history."
"Fans should voted KD's name more than Bron. It's not like casuals dont know who Kevin ""The Hardest Road"" Durant is."
And how much did team team durant lose by? 20.  Guess kevin was what was missing
Also Kevin Durant and Embiid didn't play. Imagine Lebron and Curry not playing for team Lebron while Team KD being healthy
"My three month old son just looked at me and said, “Father, why does Kevin Durant hate historically black colleges and universities?”"
Whatever Kevin Durant decides to do after his Hall of Fame playing career please do not be a GM
"And if that wasn't bad enough, but COVID says fuck Kevin Durant and took away the team's best player"
Kevin Durant said fuck them kids
why are people surprised that a Kevin Durant team of all stars is melting against a Steph Curry team?
forgetting maybe the most iconic bounce pass oop over then temmate Kevin Durant for a Giannis slam.
Where is kevin durant?
"No, I never did. I loved it. The NBA has always been about dynasties so I could care less what other fans thought.  Also the only reason we were ever in a position to get KD in the first place was an absolute fluke situation that transpired over many years in the making. The 2016 cap spike + Steph not being on a max contract because of his injury issues early in his career. Had it not been a confluence of events, Kevin Durant would’ve never come."
"&gt; Warriors only won first year because Mike Conley, Kevin Love, and Kyrie got hurt. Steph is a choker he couldn't win finals mvp. The warriors only went to the finals the following year because Durant choked a 3-1 lead"".  did i say that? why are you saying that to me? lol  cuz i never said that"
"&gt;KD joined a premade championship team that only lost 9 games the previous season.  ""Warriors only won first team because Mike Conley, Kevin Love, and Kyrie got hurt. Steph is a choker he couldn't win finals mvp. The warriors only went to the finals the following year because Durant choked a 3-1 lead"".   It's funny how people can say this nonsense, but then turn around and say the warriors was some all time great team before Durant joined."
"LeBron wins title in 2016  *Kevin Durant joins Steph, Klay, Draymond etc   LeBron wins title in 2020 *team of Kevin Durant, Kyrie, Harden, Blake Griffin forms  The other players in the league know the lengths they have to go to, to defeat this man. 18th season btw.  GOAT."
"Zach Lavine, Lebron, A Gordon, Kevin Durant, Embiid. Need these guys in the next one to save this shit event."
Kenny switching teams like kevin Durant
"This was what I was thinking.   Kenny had me weak when he said ""that's a 10 in any other contest"".   ABD a million times including in games, even Kevin Durant hit one in an old offseason scrimmage years ago.   Jason Richardson's was better back in the day."
Kevin Durant did not give af with these picks lol
Is kevin durant going to forfeit
The biggest obstacle to the Nets chances will be if James Harden or Kevin Durant want to mention the earth is round in front of Kyrie.
BREAKING: Kevin Durant hates black people
Wait where is kevin durant?
"""See kids, Kevin Durant and Zack Levine came back from an ACL tear to greatness.""  Kevin Durant is in his own unique frame an athletic freak and Zack Levine is athletic enough to win 2 NBA dunk contests.  That's not the most relatable message."
"Yes, the NBA held out Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid just so Zion Williamson could start. And his team was probably playing for him for the first few possessions because it's his first ASG."
"https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Stephen-Jackson-Kevin-Durant-DeSean-anti-Semitism-15394993.php  How about KD liking Stephen Jackson's post where he doubled down and said that DeSean was just ""speaking the truth"" about jewish conspiracies?

Already mistaking Kevin Durant for Kevin Garnett. This is gonna be a long night
"That's true. But most won't believe it till he straight up says it.   I bet the NBA is horrified about this stuff. I say that because if he cross the line and they try to punish him, I feel many players will stand up and support him.   Kevin Durant seemed pretty cool with DeSean Jackson's Hitler post last here when he liked it."
"""*I put y'all together, now go win for me.*"" - Kevin Durant"
"Reminder, this guy played on the same team as Kevin Durant.  ...and Klay Thompson."
"Let me get this straight, so KD signed with a 73 win team that took pay cuts to form a literal starting 5 of all stars. Now he's in brooklyn where in the span of two years he has another damn near starting 5 of all stars in Irving, Harden and Griffin.   Kevin Durant is the best player in the world and LeBron James needs help to win? Bro, the hypocrisy on the internet is getting out of hand. Keep that energy consistent for fuck sake, this shit is weak."
"&gt;“KD jokes around though” &gt; &gt;Uhh, are you new to Kevin Durant sir?  I agree with OP, KD def jokes around on one of his accounts.  It's the other accounts he's more serious on"
It's short for Kevin Durant
 The bolded ones are all Yes.   The strikethroughs definitely No.  The others are borderline.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Lebron James** * James Harden * Steph Curry * **Giannis Antetokoumpo** * **Kevin Durant** * ~~Kyrie Irving~~ * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * ~~Russell Westbrook~~ * ~~Luka Doncic~~ * Joel Embiid * ~~Karl-Anthony Townes~~ * ~~Jayson Tatum~~ * ~~Ben Simmons~~ * ~~Devin Booker~~ * ~~Trae Young~~
"Kevin Durant had prior business ventures in New York. It is one of the largest and greatest cities in the world.   Kawaii Leonard grew up a Lakers fan. Still, he went to the clippers anyway. Surely you’re going to say that he didn’t want to be third fiddle, but it’s a similar situation where the more appealing option (playing in MSG) has its downsides where the clippers/nets built an incredible organization to entice their “hometown” stars.   I am being incredibly realistic when I say Kyrie’s childhood fandom had little, if anything to do with Brooklyn acquiring their big 3"
Generational talents:  Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  &amp;#x200B;  Up Next:  Giannis Antetokoumpo   Zion Williamson
"Like OP's example, using only ""Kevin"" to refer to Kevin Durant. Same for any player with a relatively common name and a relatively uncommon other name. If you said ""James"" then we'd ask ""LeBron or Harden?"""
"Is this for real? Some of you fanboys already getting insecure?   &gt;  You are acting like GSW is a bad team.. With Klay, they have 3 star players. Without him, just 2. Along with many other good wing players and a great Rookie big man with massive potential.  Most teams don't even have that..   &gt;  If Curry doesn't even get this team to the playoffs, then that's on him. But no one with a brain expects GSW to be any threat in the playoffs to the likes of Lakers and Clippers, or even the Nuggets.   Playoffs is a different animal.. and the Warriors don't have the 73-9 team depth, or a Kevin Durant.  Just Curry at the help won't be good enough. His entire game is 3pt shooting dependent.. and when you take it away, he'd be invisible   &gt;  But let's NEVER be delusional and ignorant enough to act like GSW is a ""bad"" team. They are just in the WEST, which is bottom heavy. Unless you are the 3 best teams in the West.. it'd be hell to make the playoffs.  5-8 seed is always a chaos in the Western Conference  &gt;  Same thing happened with AD and New Orleans.. But GSW is still a far superior team than AD ever had in New Orleans, even without Klay.   But AD could cover BOTH offense and defense at the highest level.  So he did a lot, with less. Until he realized there's no point anymore.  Then he chose his own path  &gt;  For Curry, it's not the same. He had his good ""5 years"". A lot of crazy luck, and a lot of superior help.. and great times. But now it's time to face reality..   Atleast with a healthy Klay, and Draymond being the defensive powerhouse..  they'd still be a good threat  &gt;   **EDIT**:   Don't forget.. Someone like Dame Lillard always had a similar team. GSW and Curry actually has many better players than the Blazers..   Then there's the SUNS. Look at them popping off..    &gt;  Just few examples"
"Dude, are you dense? No one knew how good they would be until after the fact. You are obviously looking at their career in hindsight. Pippen was garbage when he was DRAFTED and got better. Phil Jackson was an UNKNOWN coach with 0 rings. Jesus.  A superteam is an ALREADY KNOWN super star like Lebron James joining a super star like Dwayne Wade and all star like Chris Bosh by signing with Miami. A superteam is superstar Kevin fucking Durant joining the 73-9 GSW with Unanimous MVP Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. This isn't Rocket science."
This mans really said Tobi on Kevin freaking Durant. And Tisse on ky when he dropped 40 on prime Klay Thompson?    Idk about that chief
&gt; I am not Kevin Durant  That's exactly what KD would say.
"If I had ballhog gloves and boingvert as a kid, I'd be Kevin Durant. Instead I am not Kevin Durant"
It's Kevin Durant + an MVP PG + an all-star SG
Joel Embiid is just Kevin Durant but also a DPOY change my mind
"Embiid could drop 50 every game but with Ben averaging 12 and Tobias averaging 18, the Nets will just outscore them. Nobody is stopping Kyrie, Harden and Kevin Durant"
Joel “Kevin Durant” Embiid
"So we got another superteam, and it's centered around Kevin Durant again  Really was glad that we'd gotten out of that era...now we're right back in it"
"Christian Wood being out has given his team more losses than Kevin Durant, is Christian Wood the MVP??"
Kevin Durant too right?
"The crux of this issue is mathematical and quantitative, the intersection of several linear equations, it isn't qualitative.  It isn't correct to generalize any scenario without looking at the player profile.   For example, if you are giannis you should never take a 17 footer unless the shot clock is below 2.  The inefficiency of the shot never makes it worth players playing up on giannis.  They won't change their scheme.  He can take as many as he wants, its always a bad shot and the defense knows that.    Even when defenses play irrationally, e.g. over-guarding kawhi who is a great not elite jump shooter, the value added to his other shots is still marginal given the borderline utility of his 40-45% midrange jumper.  Kawhi should be taking significantly less midrange jumpshots than he does, but not zero.  Then you have Kevin Durant who shoots historically well from the midrange around 53% and probably even higher when excluding low shot clock plays.  Even then, he probably takes too many.  It may be a health concern at this point which is why I qualify that statement, but on golden state his overreliance on the midrange over taking 3s was one of the inefficiencies of that team.  He already had open lanes to the basket with curry and thompson on the floor, he didn't need 40% of his shots to come from 14-23 feet.   He could have taken 20% and achieved the same shot quality on more efficient field goal attempts.  Zion williamson is an example of a perfect analytical player.  20 points per game in the paint, takes 3s only when wide open and never takes midrangers.  80% of his shots come from the restricted area and he hits nearly 70% of them.  This is what happens when you balance your ranges appropriately and don't compromise shot selection when you can achieve the same shot quality."
"Just went back to check. The starting five of the 2008 Rookie Team was composed of Al Horford (21), Kevin Durant (19), Jeff Green (21), Mike Conley (20), and Luis Scola (27 years young) lol"
"Actually at the time, Giannis didn’t have more wins, we allowed the media to spin a narrative that had Kevin Durant and Steph Curry dominate the league for 4 years and get 0 non finals accolades, that’s just ridiculous and arguably shameful."
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are on that team  Whenever I’d say anything about Curry or Durant winning it it was always “well he has the other guy on his team he can’t win it” so explain why that just goes away now
Some pairs that I can think of that haven’t been mentioned here yet:  LeBron and Horace Grant (03-04)  Kevin Durant and Sam Cassell (07-08)  Dwight Howard and Reggie Miller (04-05)  Kyrie Irving and Gilbert Arenas (11-12)
"&gt;\#2 Kevin Durant. Hold on for the return to Seattle basketball. How sweet would it be to see KD make his way to Seattle for his farewell tours years?    Not a Sonic fan, but this would piss me off beyond words if I was.  Your team drafts one of the best players in your history, but gets stolen for a couple decades, and all you get is a bad rookie campaign and a farewell tour?  Fuck that."
"Playing the ""No MJ or Lebron"" Game:  G: Chris Paul -6'0""- Elite Playmaker, Solid Defense  G: Steph Curry -6'3""- Elite Off-Ball Movement and GOAT Shooting ability  F: Tony Allen -6'4""- Elite On-Ball Defender  F: Kevin Durant -6'10""- Can score on anyone anytime, Versatile Defender and can rebound  C: Zion Williamson -6'7""- Elite offensive rebounding, nearly unstoppable inside the paint scoring-wise"
"When you combined the Lakers fanbase with the Lebron fanbase, it was basically the fandom equivalent of Kevin Durant joining the 73 win Warriors"
Kevin Durant doesnt actually exist and was made up as a money laundering scheme for the Nets
"That is such a hilariously dumb argument. Dort had that game because he was getting left completely alone and ignored on the perimeter because he had been so so so bad. Kawhi didn't get left alone despite playing with multiple hall of Famers because he was too good.  And Kawhi in his rookie year played in the WCF and primarily guarded ***KEVIN DURANT*** and... oh yeah James Harden lol. And put up an 18/10 game in game 2.  You'd think someone with those names in his username would remember that, but you only made your account like a month ago so I assume you're just a child"
"Wow, you’re right. Actually puts it into perspective that Cleveland 2016 is regarded by many as the most (before anyone hates, just pretend I said *one of* the most) valuable rings of all-time. Now add Kevin Durant."
Mf is hitting step backs like Kevin Durant.
"Shaq is basically the Kevin Durant of his era. Had he grown up today, he'd be out there arguing with casual fans on instagram, same as KD."
"This is stupid. It’s not a nickname. Melo IS both of these guys name.   In case you disagree here are examples of nicknames:  The Mailman The Answer The Glove Air Jordan DJ. J The Big O The Dream The Greek Freak.   Melo being made about people calling Melo,  Melo would be like Kevin Garnett being bad about people calling Kevin Durant, Kevin."
"Yes, I absolutely can claim small sample size. It’s painfully clear you don’t actually know anything about shooting and how long it takes to stabilize and draw conclusions from.   If you wanna believe that he suddenly went from a below average to mediocre shooter to better than Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant, go ahead. Feel free to delude yourself."
"I half agree with your point, but I still don't think getting to 40K is easier than it used to be. Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are two of the greatest outside shooters ever, and neither will sniff 40K."
"Harden's consistency has been insane and he led us to a nice win streak without Kevin fuckin Durant. Totally deserved, he's been amazing for us and deserves MVP buzz given how we've played without KD AND Kyrie a few times as well."
Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala but that's kind of a copout so I'll say Demar Derozan
"Comparing 3 percentage with a dude who’s played like 10 seasons versus a guy who’s played not even 3 is difficult anyway, but I’m saying Luka is not far behind James because he takes a similar amount of 3’s and his percentage is climbing, and he’s 22. When all is said and done I think it’s pretty reasonable to say Luka and harden aren’t going to be that different of shooters, because as I said harden has never hit 40%, let alone 37% in houston. He’s hitting at 40 right now cuz he plays with fucking Kevin durant and kyrie"
"Sorry, but Kawhi, Siakam and Gasol match up against Lebron and AD way better than Kevin 'Slenderman' Durant and Steph. The 2019 Raptors were much better on defense than any Warriors team."
Kevin Durant  or Bradley Beal(Florida Fan)
"Here's an *amazing* hypothetical trade - Khris Middleton for Kyle Lowry straight up.  As a Raptors fan, I would love this trade. We would get to see the start of our 'rebuild' by trading our aging top-10 point guard for a great piece to build for the future in Khris Middlleton. Khris Middleton can be kept if the Raptors want to stay middle of the pack in the East. Steady Freddie would take the rain as the de facto playmaker of the raptors - a role he's ready for. The team would lose a bit of playmaking, ballhandling and leadership from Kyle Lowry, but Khris Middleton would give us better shooting and Middleton isn't a bad playmaker himself. Raptors could trade Middleton too for 2 or 3 first round picks if they wanna rebuild harder.  Milwaukee fans: wouldn't you like this trade? You would get first an amazing presence for the team's culture. Kyle has shown he can work great with coaches to develop an amazing culture; with Kyle and Mike's brains working together, the Bucks could come up with some super high-IQ offensive schemes. Next you would get improved playmaking and ballhandling from Lowry. Him and Holiday would be an unreal guard duo. Lowry knows how to use his body extremely well so there would be little loss on defence despite his deceptive 6 ' 0 frame. And last but not least, Lowry will give you an efficient 18 a night - only a 2 point loss from Middleton.  Their salaries match pretty evenly - maybe Milwuakee would have to throw in salary filler - but other than that the trade would work pretty evenly. As a Raptors fan I am sad to see Lowry go - he was an amazing leader not only for the Raptors but in everything he does. Lowry will always be an icon in Canada. This represents a win-now move for the Milwuakee Bucks. With the offensive versatility, culture, and defence that this team will have led by the Big 3 of Giannis, Kyle Lowry, and Jrue Holiday, this team will be enough to beat any other team in the East. I would bet that Big 3 and the Bucks depth to win over Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and their depth. I would easily see this team beating the 76ers.   Let me know what you all think!"
"Signing an aging Chris Paul who you traded after 2 seasons is a bit different than Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving teaming up."

"Zion in college was a wonder. Don't think I have ever seen a more exciting college prospect. Made me wish 18 year old Lebron played for one year in college before coming to the NBA. It would have been man against boys kinda dominance. Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Wade and Embiid were also so fun to watch in college."
"So because individuals like Al Davis valued athleticism over skill  which led to picks like Jamarcus Russell or Darius Howard-Bay or the Blazers picking a 7’0 270lbs 19 year old with great athleticism, feel, and body over another star college player although he posted spectacular scoring statistics, completely sucked at the combine, you think your point is correct?  Interesting.  Funny enough, you either are not well-versed enough or too young but one of the issues with Greg Oden other than his knees being structurally week was the fact that he actually did not really want to play basketball the way Kevin Durant did. You’re making it seem like the combine is a complete and utter failure and the NFL and the NBA only do it because dumb people like to watch it because you know, it’s totally free.  Good points."

"What a ridiculous take.   You don't actually think this Cavs team has any chance of taking out a Kevin Durant-led superstar team, do you?"
"In 2013-14 Russell Westbrook only played 46 games for the season, leaving Kevin Durant to play as the only dynamic scorer on his team for 36 games. This is the closest we've seen to Durant being the only capable scorer on his team (without a Curry, Klay, Harden, Russ type).      In those 36 games he averaged 21.2 FGA per game and averaged 32.9 PPG on 51/39/88 shooting splits. If he got the chance to take an extra 3.8 shots per game I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see an average around 37-40 PPG."

"Uh, other way around my guy  There's a 90% chance Kyrie, Harden and Kevin Durant all make it in over either Simmons or Tobias. Not just based on performance, but also popularity.   Harden &amp; KD are locks, obviously. You think voters are gonna snub Kyrie, despite his off the court controversies, with how well he's playing?   Only reason Simmons made in before was because the East was so devoid of superstar talent up until now. And Tobias, despite him absolutely ballin this season (all credit to him), aint makin it either"

"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."

Kyrie Irving, one of the most efficient players of all time. You have to focus on him too. Then, that’s not even the end. Joe Harris is one of the best shooters in the league. You have to focus on him. And then there’s, Jeff Green. He’s not gonna do anything, right??? Other than shoot over 45% from 3......  This Nets team might be as good as the 2017 Warriors."

"Kendrick Perkins claims James Harden played poorly vs. Miami Heat in 2012 Finals due to constant strip club trips  Peter Dewey Kendrick Perkins was teammates with James Harden on the Oklahoma City Thunder when they faced the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.  Miami won the series in five games, and Perkins recently revealed that Harden’s struggles were because of all the activities, including strip clubs, that were available to him in Miami.    “Man, James ain’t give a s— and you know why,” Perkins said after explaining that everyone else brought their A games to the series. “Motherf—— King of Diamonds and everything cut a hole in his hands.”  Perkins also explained that they didn’t run into the same problem against the San Antonio Spurs because there was less to do in the city.  “In San Antonio, you didn’t have a damn thing to do,” Perkins added. “Shit, we got to motherf—— Miami, it was every-motherf——-thing to do. We couldn’t get that motherf—– to buy a bucket in that motherf—–.”  Harden averaged just 12.0 points per game in the series and shot 9-for-31 from the floor.  The Thunder would eventually break up their young core with Harden moving on to Houston. He now is reunited with Kevin Durant in Brooklyn.  Miami may have had a better team anyway, but Harden’s struggles certainly helped the Heat win the 2012 Finals."

This is a fraternity of 400 or so guys and they don't all have to like each other at all times. Borderline NBA players don't need to be protected from shit talk from all-stars, what they need to do is keep grinding, and next time you play somebody remember that and bring a little extra for those guys. So many people got participation trophies in sports that are trying to dictate the way competitive athletes carry themselves. Klay is a HOFer, a champion. He can punch down if he damn well pleases when it comes to sticking up for his boys. I've met Klay (humblebrag) and he was super nice. I personally thought Klays comments were pretty funny. Also a fan of ""it's a mans league"", totally got to eat those words too, along with Lebron's Halloween cookies. Judging the guy to be a dick because of once or twice trash-talking over a long career is dumb. Be real. If he was on your team you'd love Klay. Chocolate milk, bull-dog lover, silly China stuff, Instagram thot nonsense, stoner, hanging out at Delores park and trying to play some rando's trumpet. Klay is a real one."

"Dude, Kevin Durant is kind of a piece of crap, personality wise. When he was in Oakland he committed to charities and then pulled out like it was nothing, leaving the charity without its promised budget. His donations were like a few pennies out of his pocket and while the rest of the team would spend several days going to their various nonprofits, fundraising, doing PR to get these charities visibility, Durant literally spent 30 min looking bored st a photo shoot handing out toys to kids before he left and never came back. Who does that to a children’s charity? Don’t half ass your commitments to people trying to feed, clothe, and raise healthy kids in an already under-resourced area. The charity had to scramble to recoup funds after he pulled out unexpectedly and had to cut services that they’d planned when he promised more funds. Other players who have left Oakland have been kind enough to continue supporting the charities they did when they were on the warriors, but not Durant. That speaks volumes to me. I am not surprised that he doesn’t get along with his former team mates, his behavior leaves a spur taste in my mouth. He has the money to donate even if he didn’t think it was “worth his time” to actually engage in-person with a nonprofit."

"LeBron James  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Ante...  Jokic  Anthony Davis  Embiid  Damian Lillard  Alex Caruso  factoring in the fact that kyrie havnt done shit since he played with lebron, the top 10 stays."
"Is Dwyane Wade better than any of the following players (list not in order)?  Jordan, Kareem, LeBron, Bird, Magic, Duncan, Dirk, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Shaq, Hakeem, David Robinson, Julius Erving, Wilt, Bill Russell, Charles Barkley, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robinson, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Garnett, Chris Paul, Havlicek, Bob Pettit, Kawhi.    There are others I'd put ahead too but my point is that he isn't a top 25 player ever imo. For the 2000s he didn't even play the whole decade. He is clearly behind Shaq (who ended decade badly but was amazing for most of it), Dirk, Duncan, Kobe, LeBron, Nash, and Garnett. He is borderline top 10 along with  Dwight and Chris Paul in there too."
My MVP favorites are:  1. Joel Embiid 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Nikola Jokic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James
I’m not. I give my honest and educated opinion on all of my posts. Kevin Durant is the clear cut best player in the NBA.  I think I triggered people by not having Luka Dončić on my top 5. I was told he was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential. I’m not going to delude myself and give dishonest opinions for internet points.
"Anthony Davis is a better player than Joel Embiid. I don’t care if he’s struggling in the regular season. He’s a playoff monster.

Kawhi Leonard deserves it more than Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokić.  Kevin Durant and LeBron James should be the favorites to win MVP though. Interesting that the top 3 MVP candidates are the 3 best players in the NBA (in order).

"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player *at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
He came back just fine. Or is every contract contingent on the player being healthy? Is Kevin Durant on a bad contract because he missed a year of playing?

Kevin Durant won an MVP playing with Westbrook. PG13 had an MVP worthy campaign playing with Westbrook. Westbrook has led the league in assists.   Saying Westbrook has never made his teammates better is exactly the nephew level nonsense this sub always spews.
"Why are you comparing the best player on the planet to LeBron James, Wardell Stephen Curry II, etc?   Kevin Durant tried to spoon feed Wardell Stephen Curry II the FMVP in 2018, but Wardell Stephen Curry II choked. You’re worried about Kevin Durant’s ego? Funny.  The Los Angeles Lakers aren’t locks to make the NBA Finals. The Brooklyn Nets will sweep the Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals."
"Stephen “Human Torch” Curry I loved but never stuck w the public sadly.   And ppl don’t remember, but Kevin Durant used to be called “kid clutch” in 2010  b4 switching to Durantula or something."
"Its not that they couldnt have won with Westbrook. Maybe they could have, maybe they couldnt have.  The argument will always be that his style of play and lack of recognition of how much better Kevin Durant was than him eventually drove KD to look for greener pastures. In fact it was so bad that KD chose Golden State and talked about how their style of basketball is what drew him to them.  The other argument that will eventually develop is that OKC essentially chose Westbrook (and Ibaka) over Harden.  While the common theory is that OKC should have amnestied Kendrick Perkins, the real lucrative dynasty would have come from trading a young, budding Russell Westbrook.   It's revisionist history for most of the league's fans, but the potential of a team built around Harden and KD, combined with the assets they could have gotten had they (purely theoretically) chosen to trade Russ instead of Harden, is a hypothetical of equivalent potential to the story that Houston almost had Jordan, Drexler and Hakeem."
yeah in the end you can be 6-7 ft but you can’t teach god given talent. Kevin Durant is a nuclear cheat code of a near 7 footer that can do way more than dunk

Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Champion himself in the great arena?    Russell Westbrook: You would fight me?    Kevin Durant: Why not? Do you think I am afraid?    Russell Westbrook: I think you've been afraid all your life.     *Wizards sweep the Nets in the ECF*"
"""In the locker room, James Harden is watching Hustlers when he calls over Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving: ""You see this shit right here. You die for what you believe in. You die for your boys. This is that mentality we need to have going into the strip club. It’s about making it rain."""
"Such a bullshit narrative. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to team up, and they thought they would cute in black and white. They also convinced James Harden and Blake Griffin to quit on their teams to come join the bandwagon. None of this has to do with skill on the part of the Nets' front office. As long as they were better than the Knicks, they were getting KD and Kyrie."

Paging Kevin Durant.
"I think it would be a grind for two games. Then the Nets blow them away. I think yall are forgetting that, when healthy, they have James Harden and Kevin Durant playing together. That's egregious."
"Definitely not.  Tatum was a rookie, Brown a sophomore, and Kyrie/Hayward/Horford are all worse than Curry/Klay/Dray.   Not to mention they had Kevin fucking Durant lol."
"if you question Chris Paul's merit as a #1 by saying he only achieved something big with Harden, Russ's record at playing with anyone who isn't Kevin Durant is pretty woeful for a superstar.  He actively made the Rockets worse for three months until they said fuck it and had him play 4 on 3 basketball."
"&gt; Clippers and Warriors finally realised that they're in Los Angeles and San Francisco so they can have Free Agency on easy mode.  Oh, do tell how the Warriors have free agency on easy mode.  Other than Kevin Durant - who did not come to Golden State because he wanted to live in San Francisco - what star free agents have we had?"
"must be hard to type Kevin Durant into the search bar of those services, hell even google has KD Insta as first result.."
"&gt;Jeter owns the Marlins. Leave the poor gents be.  Jeter actually lives in Miami, though.  &gt; -Besides, we all know they're going to be the SuperSonics in a couple years, which means they automatically get Kevin Durant back.  Hmm, which star are they going to get to make sure KD gets to be the Pippen again? :p"
Kevin Durant for his social media trolling even though he's a cool guy on the actual court.
"Jeter owns the Marlins. Leave the poor gents be.   -Besides, we all know they're going to be the SuperSonics in a couple years, which means they automatically get Kevin Durant back.   That's clearly how this works."
"Having the second best season among the best basketball players in the world, ahead of superstars like LeBron James and Kevin Durant isn’t an accomplishment?"
"Starters:  PG: Steph  SG: Klay  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Draymond  C: Wilt  Bench:  Chris Mullin, Nate Thurmond, Iguodala, Rick Barry, Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond.  That's for a team, not a list of the greatest."
Kevin Durant Gary Payton Mitch Richmond Bob Petit Patrick Ewing
Kevin Durant
"Steph Curry (2021), Michael Jordan (1992), LeBron James (2013), Kevin Garnett (2004), Shaq (2001) with Kevin Durant (2018), Tim Duncan (2002), Magic Johnson (1985), Larry Bird (1986), Scottie Pippen (1992), Kareem (1972) and Klay Thompson (2015) to round it out"
Op u missed Kevin Durant I guess
"Idk if we’re going off their career in general or just their time with the Nets, but here’s a rough list  Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving/Deron Williams  James Harden/Joe Johnson/Vince Carter  Kevin Durant/Dr. J/Paul Pierce  Kevin Garnett/Derrick Coleman/Kenyon Martin  Brook Lopez  If it’s just about their time with the Nets, then you can go ahead and replace Pierce with Richard Jefferson and Deron with Drazen Petrovic. I’m sure I may be forgetting some people.   Honorable mention based on career: Sam Bowie, Buck Williams"
That because Kevin Durant is an overrated choker on balance for his career 🙂
"Dude literally nobody with a brain has had Kd as a top 2 player in the league for more than maybe 1-2 seasons his entire career. It was LeBron &amp; Kobe. Then it was LeBron and Steph. Right now it’s Steph &amp; whoever you want to choose for #2  My hot take is that Kevin Durant is one of the most overrated basketball players in the history of the NBA. He is an all time great, truly elite scorer of the basketball. Who does literally nothing else on a level even close to that.  Kd to me is one of the greatest second fiddles of all time. Right up there with Scottie, he scored more than Scottie, but he did everything else less than Pippen.  I look forward to eating my words if KD ever gets a chip where he is the best player on that team. I just don’t see it ever happening. If the Nets win a title this year, Point Harden is the best player on that team and the reason they win the title.  KD is an all time natural offensive talent, specifically at scoring the basketball himself. You can’t get me to even consider him an all time great at literally anything else.  And for all time pure scorers, I’ll take Steph over KD every time, and probably even Harden over him."
"Here are some of my sources!     BTW, none of this is Durant slander. Dude is a walking bucket and I love watching him play. I just think he gets a smidge too much credit for the rings, and Harden doesn't get his just dues.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html   https://www.landofbasketball.com/player\_comparison/kevin\_durant\_vs\_james\_harden.htm"
What ppl don’t seem to consider and it’s happened so quick is that Kevin Durant literally tore his Achilles a year ago. What we are seeing now isn’t even peak kd. We just have already expected it cause kd is that amazing. Normally I’ll give the edge to a guy who can provide amazing scoring plus amazing defense or amazing playmaking but there are some exceptions like with kd and Steph curry.
Because star free agents had been rejecting the Lakers during that period. Guys like Lamarcus Aldridge and Kevin Durant were rejecting them.
"YOU need to look stats. KD this season is shooting 48% on catch and shoot jumpers and 49% on pull-ups.  Klay, in his last healthy season, shot 44% on pull-ups and 42% on catch and shoot jumpers.   IN THAT SAME SEASON, ON THE SAME TEAM (2019) - KD shot better on catch and shoot jumpers AND pull up jumpers.  Stop lying out of your ass. No way in HELL Klay is twice the shooter as Kevin Durant."
"To think the OKC Thunder once had James Harden, Kevin Durant and JEFF GREEN on the same team. Just imagine what could have been."
"What pleases me more than anything about how good Harden has been with the Nets is how clearly Kevin Durant has become the GOAT ""Scottie Pippen"".   Westbrook in OKC, Steph at GSW and now Harden at BKN. KD is absolutely the *best* player of all of those - but he's never been the leader of either of them.  And this gives me great joy.   GOAT Pippen. &lt;3"
"I wouldnt say Curry is the second best player in the league in general though. Although he is definitely an interchangeable Top 5. For me, it would be:   1-Lebron  2-KD  3-Giannis   4- Kawhi Leonard  5- James Harden  My reasoning for why I put KD as second is because he has always been second to Lebron for his entire career. At KD’s full health you can even debate that he’s better than Lebron( I dont think that, but people do and thats their opinion), but I see it like this. You have Lebron James and Kevin Durant right next to each other on the same pedestal , and then there’s everyone else below them. They’re that dominant.  Now on my list, I put James Harden and snubbed Curry. This is the part where the two are switchable because they are so similar in effectiveness, that you wouldn’t be wrong to choose one over the other. I got Harden, but I think 80% of people would take Curry over Harden."
Kevin Durant really doesn’t get enough credit for his defense.
"I think they chose isolation as a primary offense (and switching as a primary defense) because of Golden State. They knew they would have to go through them, and they were right. And they almost did. Cleveland laid the blueprint in the ‘16 Finals by slowing it down, making Steph work individually on defense and taking away the Warriors’ advantage when they play fast.  Unfortunately the Rockets also had to deal with Kevin Durant."
His daddy is Kevin Durant? I know we swept the Knicks but that’s not nice to say.
BREAKING: Kevin Durant and James Harden are good at basketball
"Rose really turned y’all into a threat.   Also Randle. If Kevin Durant had come to the Knicks and put up Randles stats, they’d be calling him an mvp candidate."

Kevin “Not a playmaker” Durant dropping dimes

"Well I’d take 32 games of Kevin Durant over 51 of Jimmy Butler? I don’t see the difference here man.   I understand what your saying, hey LeBron is more valuable. No denying it. I too would take 43 games of LeBron over 52 of Kyrie. But it’s over a mostly complete season.   Otherwise All-NBA teams should have Harden, LeBron, AD and KD on them."
"Those same miami beat guys (5 reasons sports) have literally made up multiple fake stories this year.

I always thought it was because Marcelo Huertas is better than Kevin Durant
Here's the full list from the NBA:  Larry Bird   Malcolm Brogdon   Stephen Curry   Kevin Durant   Reggie Miller   Steve Nash   Dirk Nowitzki    Mark Price  (Fine company!)
Kevin Durant with the Sonics
"I said it and I'm joined by most people who pay attention to defense.  A serious defender challenges 3-point shots.  Westbrook often lets them shoot so he can move in for the rebound.  Maybe he's changed.  I haven't watched him with the Wizards.  Some people get fooled by players who make the occasional spectacular block and don't notice the small, consistent mistakes during the game.   As a Warriors fan I got to see Durant play a lot.  His defense was excellent and was a frequent point of conversation during the championship runs.  Did you ever see stories about Westbrook like this?[https://news.yahoo.com/kevin-durants-defense-made-thunders-152521766.html](https://news.yahoo.com/kevin-durants-defense-made-thunders-152521766.html)  Westbrook gets described as ""adequate"" when someone with his physical gifts should be outstanding."
 But who is advertising him as any more than he is? He’s an “all star reserve if the conference isn’t super strong” kind of dude and he’s giving us just enough where his contract is worth it as it’s what he’d command on the open market. The guy gets slammed constantly for not being Kevin Durant level but he’s performing fine for what he is. Any team with cap space would pay his contract if he was available and if you pair him with a super star it’s a core you can build a championship team around.
"Nah Kevin Durant can't win with parity, verdict is out on whether he can with without the historically greatest team ever on his side. I highly doubt it."
Kawhi had an impressive series with a remarkable 27.0 game score. I looked up the highest for a NBA finals series and if you consider the round vs the Sixers the finals he almost would have made the top 10.  Puts Jimmy Butler and his carry job in perspective   2000 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.6  2017 - Kevin Durant 30.3  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.1  1993 - Michael Jordan 29.6  2017 - LeBron James 29.6  1991 - Michael Jordan 29.4  1987 - Magic Johnson 28.3  2018 - Lebron James 28.3  2020 - JIMMY BUTLER 27.7  2020 - Lebron James 27.5
Also have two former MVPs still in their prime as well as an all star starter. The names alone make them a pretty big favorite. James Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Make whatever excuses you will that team better win a chip
Kevin Durant and James Harden /s  Probably Magic and Karrem
"Howard finished 3rd in 2010, but second (Kevin Durant) didn't have A MVP at the time.  Howard also finished 2nd in 2011 but first D Rose obviously didn't have a MVP before.  Howard was really close multiple times in his Magic days"

"Bro people don’t actually think that Randle is more popular than James Harden and Kevin Durant. You... you do realize that, right? They just taking shots at nets players."
"I was born in New Jersey and was a Nets fan growing up. Moved to Detroit recently, and there's no way in hell I'm leaving the fanbase with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kai Irving for one with Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes, and Isaiah Stewart. I'll watch Pistons games and hope they win, but they'll take the backseat."
"Playoff team, but not even contenders. This team is really, really awful when Steph is off the floor, like one of the worst offensive ratings in history awful. The supporting cast after Steph/Dray/Wiggins is horrid. Klay at his peak was incredibly streaky; he'd have five single digit games, then average 40 for a week. That's great if you have Kevin Durant or if you have a phenomenal bench, but it's a bigger issue when no one else on your team can produce offense and you need to step up consistently. And this assumes Klay comes back healthy; the reality is, after his long layoff, I doubt he'll be the same player. He should be a good role player who can help the Warriors secure a playoff spot, but I don't see them being better than the other, younger teams in the loaded west."
"Again, you are making things up.   So yesterday he broke the record. After breaking it, he put up 10/11/6 in the fourth quarter. Was he still chasing numbers then too?   He didn’t average a triple double with fucking Harden because Harden was the playmaker and they used Russ as a scorer. Did he average a triple double? No. Did he average 27 points? Yes. He wasn’t the primary ball handler and his job was too capitalize off Harden getting doubled and then run in transition. Why would he need to put him gaudy assist numbers if they have an elite playmaker already. They made it farther because they had James Harden and Kevin Durant with elite roleplayers. Not Beal and Raul Neto.   Do the Wizards have another elite playmaker? No.   And Westbrook with KD became an immensely better passer between the years of 2017-2019. Not to mention pace.   What makes your argument even worse is the Wizards we’re trash at the beginning of the season. Westbrook was NOT averaging a triple double, he averaged 22 6 and 6 in the first month of the season.   Yet now, when he’s averaging 23/14/14 in the last month, they just happened to go on a crazy win streak?   Everything is telling you you wrong and yet you still refuse to believe it. Like y’all have to understand there are people who are consistently watching these games."
Was Kevin Durant out of bounds again?
Of course Randle turned into fucking Kevin Durant
"Next 3 active are Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
"[I'm not the only one who thinks this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/nae8od/it_is_always_hard_to_believe_for_me_how/gxt3dau/) his best defensive postseason was 2016, and he was better in the 2018 regular season vs 2018 playoffs.   He went from getting articles [like this about his DPOY candidacy in the regular season](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy) to [him getting hunted on switches by Lou Will of all people lol](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bhpeg0/zach_lowe_i_never_seen_anyone_hunt_kevin_durant/)"
"I'm late on this, so here's a response for you in particular: Kevin Durant doesn't count as a Sonic.   Had the ownership not been tanking to try and take the team out of Seattle/in anticipation of moving to OKC, the Sonics weren't naturally on a trajectory to receive a top 5 pick."
"Dr J meant more to basketball than James Harden, Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, probably combined, ever will. That's not a hot take, read some history on the Dr.   Man might be the reason most of us had the chance to even care about basketball."
Kevin Durant thats why.   I’ve always been a diehard KD fan since i was about 10 years old so i follow him wherever he goes.
"This is a good point as well, and substantiates the fact that you can't compare examples from two decades ago to Kevin Durant in the modern NBA."
"A myopic focus on one segment of the regular season does you no favors.  We have enough of a sample size to know that Kevin Durant isn't cutting it by himself.  The question is- can we, in good conscience, rank Kevin Durant above LBJ/Curry/Harden despite his sub-par playmaking?  And no one in the replies has offered an answer."
"Who is a better player. Trae Young or Kevin Durant? Considering what you think is important, why isn't Trae more valuable/better considering his combination of volume scoring and playmaking? I'm assuming you think Doncic is just way better too right?"
That headline reminds me of that one youtube channel with clickbaity titles which gets like 500k views: Trae Young DESTROY Kyrie Irving ankles and becomes SUPERSTAR after Kevin Durant wants FIGHT him.  And the grammar is that bad
"Kevin Durant is not Lakers-era Shaq, who's sheer dominance transcended his other deficits."
"- Steph Curry has never been the best player in a finals series  - Steph Curry is not as good of a scorer/as talented as Kevin Durant - Steph Curry had one of the biggest choke jobs of all time in 2016   - Steph Curry has fewer all-NBA selections, all-star selections and fewer scoring titles   There’s probably more"

Bought nba live 08 on a whim. Watched golden state beat Dallas as the 8 seed because I loved underdog stories. Played endless fantasy drafts and always gave myself the first pick to get Kevin Durant. The rest is history my G
&gt;Steph was better and more important to the team than Kevin Durant when they played together  Tyronn Lue [agrees](https://twitter.com/BBall_Archives/status/1365002834207506433)
"&gt; Steph was better and more important to the team than Kevin Durant when they played together  Basically every local reporter and fan who watched all the games agrees with this, and national media and fans are mixed or favor Durant.   I truly believe that if you were watching the Warriors hoping that they'd win, you recognize everything Steph does to make that happen. If you were watching and hoping that they lose (like much of the national media and nba fans did), then Durant seemed like the ultimate reason that the Warriors were unbeatable. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I do think it works out that way, and in general if you're talking to a Warriors fan or someone who enjoyed them winning, they'll think Steph was the most important (by far imo), and if you talk to someone who didn't enjoy the dynasty, they'll say Durant."
PG: Stephen Curry (43 mil)  SG: James Harden (41 mil)  SF: Lebron James (39 mil)  PF: Kevin Durant (40 mil)  C: Steven Adams (29 mil)  This team just barely edges under the salary cap
Well you definitely aren't Kevin Durant
"&gt; Curry took Draymond Green who is overrated as hell and Klay and won multiple rings.  Curry won one ring with Draymond and Klay as his best teammates. Someone named Kevin Durant was on the team for the other titles, I think he's a pretty good player in his own right. Why are you pretending that Klay and Draymond were somehow a sub-par supporting cast in the first place?"
"Kevin Durant has the best twitter follow him. Sometimes he just post production but when KD gets on, he gets on and its fucking hilarious"
Kevin Durant
josh richardson is a good one  kevin durant has the best twitter though. most of the big guys just post ads nowadays
"If Kevin Durant never joined the Warriors, Steph Curry would go down as a top 5 player all-time. Durant ruined Steph's legacy."
Steph was better and more important to the team than Kevin Durant when they played together  Also Steph was absolutely robbed of finals MVP in 2015. Andre shouldn't have even been top 2 in fmvp voting that year
"&gt;	Curry took Draymond Green who is overrated as hell and Klay and won multiple rings  He “took” them to rings? Draymond and Klay were huge parts of the team that allowed the Warriors to even be contenders. Draymond is not overrated, Klay is an all star, and you’re completely leaving out *Kevin Durant*."
1. Saying this ignores the fact that two of those rings were won with a guy named Kevin Durant who won both Finals MVPs so Curry didn’t take them anywhere. That was the literal definition of a team effort.   2. If you tell me who was comparable to Klay and Dray on the 2015 Rockets I’d agree with you. If you say Dwight Howard who had a torn MCL and came off of a serious back surgery and was basically exiled from the Lakers by Kobe then i hope you’ll understand why comparing the two teams is ridiculous.
Did Kevin Durant log into Bradley Beals account by mistake? This has Durant salt written all over it
And he's not a thin skinned whiny bitch like Kevin Durant.
"And we would have had Kevin, Russ and Serge when the Seahawks were at thier peak 2010-2013 and that would have been huge for the city and the fans of the team...  I went to a few games with Ray Allen/ like ridinour/Rasheed and  two games with rookie Durant.. I will never forget them and I can’t wait to get the Sonics back...  I live in Oregon now but I can’t fully be a fan of the blazers... it feels like cheating on my team"
"50% of LeBron coming to the Lakers probably does have to do with LA but the other 50% has to do with Magic and Rob convincing him. There is no way LeBron comes to the Lakers if Jim Dumbass Buss and Mitch Kupchak were still running shit. From 2013-2016 they struck out on every big name free agent (Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron who they were going after in 2014, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and Kevin Durant didn't even wanna give them a meeting in 2016). Magic and Rob changed the FO culture and just in time too or else we wouldn't have LeBron and AD"
To think that the 73 win team is any way shape or form the same as the one that added Kevin fucking Durant is laughable. Same goes for the Cavs that just lost Kyrie Irving for basically nothing.
"That's a lot of words for barely anything said. The question is why people are skeptical of the Jazz and Suns come playoff time. The answer has nothing to do with market size.  If the Jazz or Suns had Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, or Steph Curry, they'd be taken more seriously and they wouldn't even have to relocate! Sometimes it's that simple.  The NBA is a superstar-driven league where the champion *almost always* has a widely-considered-to-be top 5/10 talent, if not several. Many strong regular season teams have folded in the face of a superstar in the playoffs, and some people here have watched long enough to learn from this. The exceptions exist, but are rare."
"I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do with a holistic player measurement that suggests Fred Van Vleet is more impactful to winning than James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, and Kevin Durant. If your suggestion is to ignore what doesn’t seem to make sense then it returns back to a subjective evaluation of the data and at that point the LEBRON measurement is pretty damn useless. This has been essentially my critique of all these holistic player measurements. They don’t really add anything to the NBA discussion besides confirmation bias when a player you like/dislike is rated high/low on RAPTOR, LEBRON, etc."
"Scoring title? Okay? Westbrook has half as many assist titles, no steal titles (CP3 has SIX btw), no all Nba defense selections (CP3 has 9), etc.   Also it’s kinda unfair to say CP3 has no finals appearances compared to Russ considering Russ’s final appearance came when he had more talent around him than CP3 ever did (DPOY caliber ibaka, the most efficient six man ever and Kevin freaking Durant)."
"yep that's pretty much what he's gone through, right down to the early success he hasn't matched. he was actually on one of the most interesting teams of the modern era, the early 2010s oklahoma city thunder. that team had just drafted kevin durant, westbrook, and james harden and it was clear that at least durant and westbrook would be stars. they had success right away and went to the finals in their third year together, losing to lebron's stacked miami heat. everybody assumed they would have many more appearances together as a group. they had very poor timing with injuries, and one by one each of them left. that was the only time they went to the finals, all 3 ended up winning MVPs in different seasons."
Well he did have Kevin Durant and James Harden for a bit.
"To be fair you guys have the most emotionally fragile set of stars currently in the league, possibly of all time: Mr. Kyrie ""dunning Kruger, Flat earth, I don't talk to pawns"" Irving, James playoff choker harden, and Kevin ""hardest road, yell at my agent and make a bunch of Twitter burners"" Durant. Totally set for playoff success."
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine  As well as front court players like:  -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  This was from 9 days ago, so maybe he's eclipsed some of these players since then but my point still stands."
"Russell Westbrook: 182 triple doubles, more than Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Bob Pettit, Scottie Pippen, Kevin Garnett, Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Derrick Rose, Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Kawhi Leonard COMBINED (181)"
"Kevin Durant on a game 6. Not a superstar at all.  On teams playing against us probably Joe Johnson or LaMarcus Aldridge, they used to murder us back in the day."
I've thought about this exact thing before and I have a note file somewhere where I was ranking guys by points-per-shot at their peak and in various well-known stretches. Yeah I found it...   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  1.3164 pps jordan threepeat  1.4666 pps lebron 2018  1.5399 pps lebron 2017  1.3216 pps lebron 2016  1.3142 pps kobe back-to-back  1.4038 pps shaq 3-peat  1.2879 pps wilt '62-'65 playoffs  1.2122 pps lew alcindor '70-'76 playoffs (as a buck)  &amp;#x200B;  1.3450 Lebron on Cavs  &amp;#x200B;  1.6118 pps Lebron 2014  1.5833 pps Lebron 2009  &amp;#x200B;  1.3828 Lebron career playoffs  &amp;#x200B;  1.3813 pps Kevin Durant career playoffs  1.4769 pps Kevin Durant Warriors in playoffs \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Zion had 1.588 this season which puts him second only to peak Lebron on the guys I measured (OP has Charles Barkley at the top it seems with over 1.7).
I caught a 100% IV Durant in Pokemon Go and I named it Kevin.
"Kd won both FMVPs. KD has won 2 titles as the main guy. Steph has never been considered the Finals most valuable player in 5 opportunities. The people who are paid for their sports knowledge for a living always felt like a player other than steph was the most valuable player including durant.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dw1GHEZ4wEnA&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi27oG-h8byAhWXHjQIHbBUDcsQwqsBegQIBhAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw1uqGMUOH53pCZdGbYIDtJY&amp;cshid=1629684643494  "" you were the guy who was actively recruiting Kevin Durant"" ""it's not a slam dunk that many other superstars would have done it""  Just like how the warriors players were laying the groundwork for giannis. Because the warriors know they won't always get depleted teams and need curry as the 2 to be positioned for a title."
"My Pokemon go collection includes Kevin Durant, Michael Jordant, Kobe Bryant, Scotty Pippant, Dwant Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Lebrant James."
"Im repeating myself because you aren't listening. KD was upset the were running isos and commented. Kerr didn't say hey Kevin we are doing that for you. He admitted Durant had a gripe and said it was done for the team, not KD.  You are trying to put you own twist on the truth so I got to keep repeating myself because I'm not going to let you keep debating in bad faith and trying to push a false narrative.  Curry doesn't know how to lead a team. Dude didn't even make the playoffs even with play in games. Only won in 15 cause of injuries and gave up the biggest choke ever.   With the talent the warriors had they should have swept in 15 and won in 5 in 16. While curry was the best player they underachied, they one 1 title despite Currys leadership."
"to be fair Durant was handed to him on a silver platter.  Even when Gen V was recently released, I already connected that bug to Kevin."
My roommate has a shiny Durant he named Kevin.
"So one time I was gonna meet an old friend of mine and we were gonna do a video game tournament.  I forget what the prize pool was that year since this was a regular thing.  This year one of the competitions was Pokemon.  We had to make a team.  I hadn't played Pokemon in YEARS.  So I decided to make a team of all the most annoying POS Pokemon who had plagued me in my childhood.  Your zubats confusing you, your electrikes paralyzing you with quick attack every god damn encounter, etc.  And then it came time to nickname the squad.  So I picked all the most horrible hateful villains.  So Gendo Ikari was on the team, Baron Harkonnen was on the team, Mordred etc etc.  This was shortly after the hardest road announcement.  I had a Durant on the squad and he just got to be named Kevin.  I always loved how perfectly that worked out."
"Then tell them that theyd have the best regular season record in NBA history, only to add Prime Kevin Durant to the core of the team."
I always named Durant Kevin when playing Pokémon
"As a mavs fan, my favorites: dame &amp; giannis  Team loyalty is big for me.  Least favorite: Kevin Durant."
"when i caught Durant in Pokemon, i immediately named him Kevin and then traded him away"
"If we're doing this correctly, the answer is Stephen Curry, Chris Mullin, Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, and Wilt Chamberlain."
"[There’s also this link that says that Curry would rather win championships over playing iso ball](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/19/stephen-curry-responds-to-kevin-durant-we-all-want-to-iso-but-id-rather-win-titles/amp/)  They totally changed the offense when KD got there. There’s video evidence of this. I won’t dispute something that evidence. Just go watch games from before KD joined and after KD joined. The offense changed. That’s a fact.   The game slows down in the playoffs and defenses play better. KD wanted to iso more and they let him iso a lot more then they ever did with Curry. It’s not because Curry can’t do it but because Curry is selfless. He would rather win championships than iso.   The Thunder had a 3-1 lead in the WCF. Their regular season record means absolutely nothing at that point. You’re judging them on their past instead of their current situation. Their current situation was having a 3-1 lead in the WCF against the best regular season of all time.   Everything you said about Steph is true, and somehow that’s who KD ended up joining because Steph had won already. Steph Curry and the warriors didn’t need KD. They just needed an upgrade at SF. Any upgrade would have lead to them still being the favorites. KD made the biggest bitch move in NBA history. Name one other top 20 player of all time that left his team to go join the reigning MVP while both were in their prime."
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-right-warriors-did-play-more-iso-against-best-defenses/  In this article Kerr talks about Durants claim that one of the reasons why he was unhappy was they changed the offense.   They didn't change the offense for him. They won in 6 against a depleted team and the next year up 3-1 as soon as they lost momentum they lost the series because the warriors offense was built on hitting shots within their offensive framework. But in 16 when the pressure was mounting and the system wasn't providing as many open shots and when it was they weren't hitting they collapsed. Kerr needed a iso player who can break down defenses without relying on ball movement and finding open shots that still need to go down.  So in the article Kerr admits that the ""warriors"" offense is great in the regular season and even early in the playoffs against just ok teams. But he says as playoff defenses get better you need guys like Jordan, Durant and Kobe to take over games with iso.  First off you notice that he didn't say curry right? Cause curry is a great shooter but he isn't a dominate iso player. Curry depends on teammates and system much more than Durant.   But also what Kerr is saying is the warriors needed Durante iso. Not the warriors sacrificed team ball to appease KD with iso. KD didn't want that much iso but Kerr forced it on them because he knew that in the biggest moments Durant offensive game was far more valuable than stephs   And again Thunder were a 55 win team that lost in 7 to a 73 win team. The warriors were a 73 win team that lost in 7 to a 57 win team.  Curry is the only multiple  time MVP to win multiple titles in their prime and not have a FMVP.  Steph Curry was the leader of the only team in nba history to win more than 68 games and not win the title. Steph was the leader of the only team in NBA history to lose as many games in the post season as they did in the regular season."
"&gt; That’s just a bunch of excuses for MJ. You’re failing to look at the 93/94 team.  How so? It's the truth, they coasted to a title with Jordan and the very next year despite having better pieces overrall, couldn't make past the second round.  &gt; That team was a bad foul call away from the ECF. They took the Knicks to a game 5 without MJ. If they don’t make that BS call the Bulls are back in ECF. That’s not normal.  No they weren't, they were a bad foul call away from being up 3-2 in the series, the foul call didn't end the series, they had two games left to play and couldn't get it done.  &gt; You think the 2017 Cavs would make it to a game away from the ECF without Bron? Not a chance.  Yes, i absolutely do, especially considering how god awful the Eastern Conference was in 2017. They probably wouldn't have made the Finals, but they would've made the ECSF. They would've had to go through a 42-40 Pacers squad led by Wayoff P to match what the Bulls did in '94, hardly a challenge.  &gt; Or how about the 2011/12 Heat? Bron had to go nuclear in a game 6 at Boston down 3-2 in order to save their season. Bron doesn’t play that series and BOS probably sweeps Miami.  So? Jordan had to score 42 in Game 7 of the 1992 ECSF to carry the Bulls through the Knicks, then he had to average 41/8/6 in the greatest Finals performance of all time to beat the Suns in six, great players do great things.  &gt; I could do this exercise with a bunch of our modern stars and I can PROMISE you their teams aren’t winning 55 games without them.   And that only shows how you fail to understand what context is. Modern stars leave their teams because they don't think they can win, so they move while their teams rebuild, Michael didn't leave, he retired, the Bulls tried to bring new pieces to keep contending, which obviously didn't work as they got bounced in the second round.  But i will go along with it. Kevin Durant AND Serge Ibaka left the Thunder in 2016, they went from 55 to 47 wins. Kawhi Leonard left the Raptors and they went from 58 wins in 82 games to 53 in 72 the next year.  And since you love to ignore context, here is one that you will love: LeBron James joined a 35-win Lakers squad in 2018, they won 37 games with him the next year, by your logic you should question his impact."
"I didn't realize way past his prime, coming off the bench, retiring in 2 years, Ray Allen is the same as prime Kevin Durant. Not to mention Boston burned the bridge by trading Ray for OJ Mayo. If it weren't for Memphis backing out at the last second, Ray would've been shipped out."
"You have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden on one team. The only thing that would make it fair is if the Lakers had Kawhi instead of Westbrick.    But for all we know, Kyrie could just end up injured again lmao"
"Shhh don’t let the secret get out man. Only Kevin Durant has won titles with multiple all-star caliber players on his team, superstars of the past only played with plumbers."
"They still on this crap all these years later? Makes me think come 2050, r/nba users will still in a bar bitching about the time Kevin Durant signed with the warriors."
"Kevin Durant last season was some of the best basketball I have ever seen played. It wasn’t even just his offense I thought he was not just great but dominant at times defensively.    The level he was at in the playoffs I have only ever seen Lebron and Shaq play that well in my time of watching basketball.    I still think his resume is nowhere near top 10 all time yet especially since he only has 1 MVP, no defensive accolades, basically missed 2 seasons of his prime and had to join an all time great team he wasn’t able to beat in order to win some championships. As a pure talent though you cannot name 10 players in history that were better basketball players than the version of Kevin Durant we saw last year"
"Also here's the comparison as teammates(and I only used playoffs because I get the sense the Warriors didn't give a damn about the regular season in those years):  Stephen Curry: 27.4/6.1/5.9, 46/39/93 shooting(62.3% TS), 1.6 STL, 3.1 TOV  Kevin Durant: 29.6/7.1/4.5, 51/40/90 shooting(64.2% TS), 1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 2.7 TOV  Actually one thing that's interesting to me is that in Durant's first year there they seemed to play their ""normal"" style and until the Finals Durant took a backseat to Curry in terms of FGA in many playoff games  But by the time of Durant's injury in 2019 they were starting to play like Durant was flat out the first option and Curry was the second option  I remember games where Curry had like 12 FGA"
"People keep forgetting [WHY](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cobugw/kevin_durant_tore_his_achilles_on_his_nondominant/) Kevin Durant healed so miraculously. There a near 0% chance Klay comes back to form, it's only a matter of how much worse he is. He's going to be slower on defense and to his spots. I'm sure that he'll still be one of the best shooters in the league, but he's sure to suffer more with coverage and defense. I'm not sure that Achilles tears are indicative of injury proneness, since most players who were ruined by their injuries were already old and injury prone. We'll just have to see."
"Was curious so I looked up Curry and Durant:  **Regular season:**  Stephen Curry(2014-2021): 27.3/5.0/6.4, 48.4% FG, 43.0% 3P, 91.3% FT, 1.7 STL, 3.1 TO  Kevin Durant(2011-2021): 27.6/7.5/5.0, 51.3% FG, 39.4% 3P, 88.3% FT, 1.1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 3.2 TO   **Playoffs:**  Stephen Curry(2014-2021): 26.8/5.9/5.8, 45.2% FG, 39.7% 3P, 92.8% FT, 1.5 STL, 3.4 TO  Kevin Durant(2011-2021): 29.8/7.8/4.3, 48.8% FG, 36.2% 3P, 86.9% FT, 1.1 STL, 1.2 BLK, 3.3 TO  **Accolades:**  Curry: 2x MVP, 6X All-Star, 3 rings, 4 ALL-NBA 1st team, 1 second team, 1 third team, two scoring titles, top 5 in MVP 4 times  Durant: 1x MVP, 9X all Star, 2 rings, 2 FMVP, 4 All-NBA 1st team, 3 All NBA second team, two regular season scoring titles, 5X postseason scoring titles, top 5 in MVP 4 times  It's up to you who is better because they are kind of close but honestly they don't stack up all that badly with the players looked at here  All they need is more rings"
"Yeah I already know about Dolph, can you tell me who this Kevin Durant guy is?"
"50s Celtics are irrelevant. They played in an era where many non white people didn’t have the same chances as the rest, those players had day jobs and the league was in its infancy.    90s bulls are just different. They drafted all their guys, had to find the right coach and role players over time then they started winning.     The Durant era warriors is like if Shaq joined the bulls in the summer of 96. It would be ruin the tension of the upcoming seasons because everybody would know with 100% certainty barring injury that they would win the title    I don’t think you understand how good the warriors are without Kevin Durant. They were an all time great team without him and Durant is a top 10ish all time type of talent and they joined forces. It was ridiculous and maybe you enjoyed the league between 2016-2019 but I almost completely lost interest once the conference finals started every year because the rest of the playoffs was just so predictable"
"I don’t think anyone is saying otherwise. But is he so much better than Kevin Durant that he elevated hem from no titles to a 3peat with some other phenomenal teams at the time? Possibly, but I think ""probably"" is fucking delusional. He's not that much better than Durant."

"This really isn't true at all. Kevin McHale generally got the tougher defensive assignment between the 3 and 4 positions. Larry rarely scaled up to guard 2's because he wasn't quick enough.  I do think Bird is a better defender than Durant, but Bird pretty routinely had easy defensive assignments due to playing alongside McHale."
Stephen Curry  Jimmy Buttler   Kevin Durant  No one else matters.
"It was amazing to watch live.  I was rooting for the Nuggets too but that Warriors team was just something else. I know most people hated them but as a technical basketball fan they were a joy to watch, one of the greatest teams of all-time playing while I'm alive.   One guy on the team is also capable of getting 37 by himself in a quarter. The guy that's supposed to be 3rd on the shooting depth chart on that team, had the highest game total and quarter total amongst them. He can also force some of the best shooters and handlers in the league to put up bench player numbers because of his All-NBA Defense. One of the top 10 greatest two-way players.  I might even put him higher than that when it's all said and done.   He'd also be in negotiation for the #1 shooter of all-time spot if it wasn't for his **god damn teammate**. Who also happened to be the #2 best shooter behind himself, and #3, and #4. Has a motor that won't quit, could bend  the fabric of time and space above a basketball court to literally **fuck the sky** with his talent.   Then their floor general is in the running for top five highest BBIQs of all-time. Can spot teammates and guard everyone. DPOY. 6x All-Defensive, 2x All-NBA.  Oh yeah then they added Kevin Durant. He was pretty good too."
"Especially when mentioning shooting (!) and defense first, how could it NOT be Kevin Durant right now?"
"You still aren't getting it.They still didn't need KD  you think they needed the 2nd best player cause they lost, and that's ignoring any context.    They could've brought back the exact same team and be considered the best team in the league and favorites for the title, which they were.   They got KD because they could, and it would obviously make them way more deadly. That doesn't mean they couldn't or wouldn't win without acquiring him.  &gt; Because the whole benefit of having Kevin Durant was to make any and all circumstances irrelevant.   that's not what we're discussing at all. Everyone knows having a backup superstar will help lol. Them still being a contender and winning playoff games is proof that they don't need him. Shit they could've competed in the 19 finals even with Klay every game."
"I'm not ignoring context. I'm very aware of the context surrounding why they lost.   Of course getting Durant wasn't the only way for them to win.   I already touched on how Green not getting suspended or Bogut not getting injured or Curry not getting fouled out would have resulted in a win.   You could even argue that Kyrie and Love getting injured is another avenue to win like it was in 2015.   Again I feel like you're misunderstanding my point...    I already acknowledged that the Warriors had the base level of talent to be able to win. That's not what getting Durant gave them. Getting Durant was getting a safety net so that even if any of the aforementioned circumstances occured again the Warriors could still win.   So if we pretend for a second that you are the Warriors front office or ownership. And I ask you ""/r/MasaiGotUsNow, your team just lost the finals. What do you ***need*** to do in order to make sure that doesn't happen again?""  Your response would probably be ""All of those circumstances are out of my control. But free agency is in my control. So what I ***need*** to do is get the best player I can so that this team is so talented that even if any of the other extenuating circumstances occur we can still win.""   Now you, as a fan, can be against that decision and think that they shouldn't be allowed to do that. That's fine.  But in the context of this conversation, regarding what the Warriors ***needed*** to do in order to, not win, but prevent a loss in the face of overwhelming adversity: it was to get the best player available, which was Kevin Durant.   And that's part of the reason it seems to you like I'm ignoring the context of the injuries in 2019 or the other circumstances in 2016. Because the whole benefit of having Kevin Durant was to make any and all circumstances irrelevant. If you make your team so good then theoretically Draymond getting suspended shouldn't matter. Curry fouling out shouldn't matter. Bogut getting injured shouldn't matter.   But as we saw, Kevin Durant wasn't even enough to negate all adversity."
"A Kevin Durant who is 6'6, lightning fast, and not a great shooter. What aren't you understanding?"
"**Series stats:**  Stephen Curry: 28/6/6/2, 61% TS  Klay Thompson: 25/4/2, 55% TS(had a higher 3P% than FG%, lol)  Kevin Durant: 30/8/3/2/2, 54% TS  Russell Westbrook: 27/7/11/4, 51% TS  Honestly I don't think KD or Westbrook actually played that bad overall in this series, their efficiency might not be great but Westbrook's playmaking and KD's defense were extremely important to them going up 3-1 in the series in the first place  They just both decided to have a horrible game at the exact wrong time(Game 6)"

"Right. I buy the argument that sports are generally moving forward. Better coaching. Better training. Better nutrition.  Also, there are simply more people playing basketball today. It's more competitive than ever.  It stands to reason that the best players of now will tend to better than the best of past eras.   I don't really see an argument that Larry Bird was better at hooping than Kevin Durant.   Was he better *relative to his era*? That seems more plausible.  I kind of lean towards KD being underrated all-time though for narrative reasons. At the top level, the franchise narratives and team success almost overshadow the individual ability, and that's going to favor people like Kobe, Bird, Magic, and Jordan who had stable careers on teams that were equipped to win everything."

Fultz got some 💩 with him. The hesi pull-up jimbo was smooth. Probably don't understand what I just said if u don't REALLY hoop  -- Kevin Durant
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
I mean Jordan and Magic being the same era is weird to me.  They played against each other in the finals and their drafts were about as far apart from one another as LeBron and Tim Duncan or Kevin Durant and AD.  5 years isn’t that long.
Kevin Durant. Just love watching him play and the stuff he posts on Twitter is always hilarious
"I think they probably used to oh, like I genuinely believed when Shaquille O'Neal signed with the Lakers that he absolutely wanted to join that history of Lakers great big men and add a few championships to that story Legacy, Michael Jordan you can go back to his early years with him saying that during his time in Chicago he wanted to elevate the Bulls to the level of the Lakers and the Celtics but these days I just don't think so, free agency and teaming up has become so normalized that I just don't see a lot of players having that mentality, maybe LeBron going to the Lakers I think he wanted to be a part of that brand genuinely and finish out his career there, I think Kevin Durant genuinely had some kind of interest in establishing Nets basketball culture for this generation, but overall I don't think today's players see it like that"
"This was a comment on a post about KD having property on Waiters Island:   ""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day."" ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion.

Kevin Durant : 42 points  Kyrie Irving : 39 points   James Harden: 23 points and 18 assists!
"People didn't take it all that seriously, but yeah it was presented as legit  https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-brooklyn-nets-superteam"
"Wasn't Bob McAdoo kinda the first big man who was more perimeter-oriented than post-oriented? As you said, watching his highlights, he had a money mid-range jumper and played like a wing (some people compare him to Kevin Durant). He also won the 1975 MVP"
They were a damn near perfect team that swapped out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant simultaneously weakening their biggest conference competitor lol
"Between Wes Matthews, Rudy Gay and Kevin Durant there hasn’t been a ton of crashing and burning post Achilles"
"Kevin Durant played a chunk of his early career in a more physical league and he just wasn't that good. I don't really know how you deal with Prime Kobe, TMAC, and all those guys in a league right now with all this space. So many of those tough shots they took would be layups because those guys were better finishers and had a better handle than KD. I think Melo too would get to 30 so much easier because there's no one at the rim"
"If I was Kevin Durant, I would have joined the golden state too"
"kevin durant is very electric when he has the ball in his hands, especially since you know he’s gonna be super efficient at the end of games. if you don’t play perfectly you’re going to see whatever lead you built get carved down in minutes"
Kevin Durant is more mature than this sub.
"How are you telling me it’s factually incorrect when you don’t even have access to the stats?  And win shares, BPM etc are extremely outdated  stats. Jokic apparently had a higher peak than Shaq by several standard deviations. Paul George is apparently better than Kobe. I just don’t think harden was as good as Kd in the playoffs, kds defense on tatum, scoring and efficiency were a lot better.   And here’s an article from end of January (period before Kd got Covid)  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-mvp-rankings-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nikola-jokic-in-mix-but-joel-embiid-is-quarter-pole-leader/amp/  Kd was firmly in mvp convos before injury.  And here is the on/off net rating of harden and Kd. https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935  The offense is so much better with Kd, then it was with harden. Like what the hell is hardens argument over Kd? When healhy Kd provided way more value. Kd is like the best player in the world while harden is like 5th or 6th. Cmon"
"Kevin Durant is the best scorer of all time, he'd average 40 if he shot as much as MJ did in his early years  Not saying he's better than MJ(as defense/playmaking are a big thing) but just in this one area I think he's the best"
Kevin Durant
"Outside of the 15-16 season, a healthy Kevin Durant has always been (slightly)better than Steph Curry"
"There’s sooo many great ones honestly, but two of my favorites that haven’t been mentioned in the thread yet are:   &gt; Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned  &gt; Kevin Love was confused when he didn’t see Jordan Clarkson run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Love saw teammate Tristan Thompson, who was lagging behind. Thompson said one word to Love. “Utah”."
"He was a blast to watch. There had been bigs that could shoot (Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace, etc.), but he was THE stretch big of the NBA at the time the NBA’s golden era for centers was just about ending. His signature one-legged fadeaway was unstoppable  and I’m not surprised players like Durant have adopted it."
"I believe this perspective to be skewed because of many league narratives. But in my opinion the 2020 best player in the league was a toss up of Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.  Again though, perspectives are skewed based on league narratives and wins/awards. You can individually look an any of these players though and objectively say they were better than Lebron James under a microscope."
"Well Westbrook shoots 40% in the playoffs for his entire career so it’s not like him shooting 37% is abnormal, it’s actually quite a regular occurrence. And whatever excuse you wanna use, there is literally zero evidence that kawhi has ever done any better on kd than even a pj tucker. And I’d argue kd is an even better offensive player (especially in the playoffs) than he was back then and kawhi is a worse defensive player than he was at the time (quite inarguable at this point). That series against the Spurs was one of KDs most efficient series that post season. Why wasn’t the DPOY gaurding the best player that plays the same position as him? Why would he apply his efforts to make an already wildly inefficient player slightly more inefficient? And the argument wasn’t was OKC better than the spurs (obviously they were that’s why they won) you said he had kds number, which like I said, there is zero evidence for. Then I preceded to bring up their previous matchup in which Kevin Durant out dueled him individually by a wide margin. They haven’t even really played each other much, what do you want me to do, bring up a game that never happened? I brought up literal statistical evidence and all you did was call me a dummy. I like kawhi leonard I just don’t know exactly where you’re point can be proven here. I know that you BELIEVE that you’re right though so I guess hey A for effort."
Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Russell Westbrook  James Harden
"Mahomes also has a stake in Sporting KC.  Russell Wilson has a stake in the Sounders. So does Ken Griffey Jr.  Kevin Durant owns 5% of Philadelphia Union IIRC.  James Harden also has a stake with the Houston Dynamo.  Steve Nash is one of the owners of the Vancouver Whitecaps.  Magic Johnson is also apart of the LAFC ownership group (and the Dodgers ownership group as well).  Though he's not a ""hyperelite athlete"", Mark Ingram owns a 1% stake in DC United.  MLS franchises have been attracting athlete investors more than MLB has in the past few years."
Kanter would have a solid team  **G:** Russell Westbrook  **G:** Dame Lillard   **F:** Jaylen Brown  **F:** Jayson Tatum  **C:** Kevin Durant  **Bench:** Marcus Smart / CJ McCollum / Carmelo Anthony / Serge Ibaka / Kristaps Porzingis / Jusuf Nurkic
Imagine having both on the same team. Then maybe adding Steph Curry and Kevin Durant lol
"Boy, did you miss something magical. That championship run was legendary. Imagine a team beating the defending champions with Kobe as their leader, then whooping Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, and ultimately prevailing over prime LeBron, D-Wade, and Bosh.  That was the Dallas Mavericks. Led by a single all-star. A man on a mission. Dirk Nowitzki."
I wish kevin durant played for my team
Kevin Durant didn’t seem that type either during the Oklahoma days.
That’s literally Kevin Durant 😂😂
so kevin durant?
"What in Luka's game do you see in Kevin Durant? I get the height and the shooting from Dirk, so what does Luka bring to the equation? KD has Luka's passing/playmaking skills?"
"Overperformed and overrated are not mutually exclusive. Take Schroder for example. Overperformed with OKC and shat the bed with the Lakers. Now he's overrated (not according to his new contract tho).     Were the Mavs really going to shoot 40%+ from 3? Hard doubt, but it happened. Not a lot of teams even nowadays can do that. It's just like Anthony Davis shooting like Kevin Durant in the bubble last year"
"He should include his name in his bio. I looked up ""Kevin Durant"" and couldn't find it, you'd need to know it's @easymoneysniper to look him up."

"In 2001 league average TS% was 51.8%, Dirk for example shot 60.1% TS% in 2001. That's a 16% increase over league average.  Comparable increase would be someone shooting \~66.5% TS% in 2021 on 10 + FGA. Something just 5 players total did, all except for Kevin Durant were centers."

What.  No way.  Middleton all the way.  Don’t undermine your dudes to make the win more impressive.  The Bucks players stepped up when it mattered most but that Nets team past Game 4 was Kevin Durant and nobody else.  One leg James Harden is terrible.  He could only dribble and pass.  James Harden is a terrible spot up shooter and an even worse defensive player and that’s when he’s healthy.  Now imagine that guy injured and not being able to do the things that make him special off the dribble and with the step back.  It was a great win but hardly an even series.  Frankly that counts on both sides too without Divencenzo  but the Nets not having a healthy Hrden and no Kyrie for the final 3 games is a much bigger loss.  The Bucks had 6 of the best 7 players in the series by the final 3 games.
And this is why Bill Russell is the GOAT. He was like Kevin Durant with championships LOL — 11 of them and 8 in a row. Number #1 All-Time Defensive Win Shares Leader — 2nd all time in Rebounds — averaged 15 ppg and 22 rebounds (career)
"These are two speculative articles with no legitimate sourced information. If Kevin Durant wanted to play for the Celtics, he’d be a Celtic right now. He wanted to be in Brooklyn, plain and simple."
I was watching this game randomly last week Indiana blew this so bad up 10 with 3:30 left and lost in regulation. Tyler Hansbrough turning into Kevin Durant was hilarious though
"I'm not going to lie when I read the title these are not the teams I was expecting lol, and I would probably pick the Spurs as well but the 2018 Rockets, they took the Kevin Durant Warriors to seven games and did not have Chris Paul in the final two games oh, and had it not been for some very low IQ bad basketball they probably win game 7"
larry bird was a bad motherfucker but it was also 40 years ago  im pretty confident kevin durant is better at basically everything in a basketball game
Am I blind or is Kevin Durant missing
"Its because even though the Warriors were missing Kevin Durant, they were still considered nearly invincible. I was road tripping through the US back to Canada between games 2-3 of the Finals and all day every talking head on the radio was convinced that even without Klay the Warriors were going to win game 3 at home.  That and the Blazers were overachieving that year at least in terms of public perception. Dame game winner and CJ round 2 game 7 performance won a lot of favor for that squad"

Likely? Giannis. My MAIN pick: Kevin Durant Sleeper: Paul George
Is it hard to argue Giannis is head and shoulder better than Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant.   The opposite answer would be Steph Curry where they downplay all of his teammates to make excuses for all of his shortcomings
"Jesus, what a terribly surface level take. TS is not the end all be all of shooting/scoring performance. Luka averages a 56.6% EFG in the playoffs, which only takes into account shots from the floor. Kevin Durant, for as lauded as he was this postseason, had a 57.3% EFG - not too far off from a top 5 scorer of all time, right? Where Luka's inefficiency comes from is his FT%. But don't look at TS% and make a superficial generalization about his efficiency when he scores like a top 3 player from the field in the playoffs."
Kevin “Magic” Durant
"""Kevin Durant claims that James Harden and Kyrie Irving aren't good shooters"""
"Unless there is a clause in your contract with large incentives for reaching a certain FG% or 3PT%, any player who doesn't heave at the end of the clock or quarter is a pussy (e.g. Kevin Durant)"
"Not as high as Bill Walton. He did 14 peak videos, but 4 get snubbed from the list.   Bill Walton, David Robinson, Kevin Durant, and Kobe."
Kevin Durant cares
"Honestly, I don't understand how anyone takes the two finals losses to the Warriors seriously. Nobody on earth was beating a team with prime Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, with good coaching to boot."

"Steph Curry has been extremely blessed with a team around him that simply could never be matched. While he is the greatest shooter of all time, he also has been blessed to have a teammate in Klay Thompson who is the 2nd greatest shooter of all time, a defensive player of the year in Draymond Green, and an MVP winner and all-time scoring titan in Kevin Durant. Curry has been able to avoid double-teams most of his career, he's had Klay and Draymond to defend the opposing team's best players, and he's been free to soak up all the fame that comes with the accolades that a perfect team accumulates and project his face into the reason it happened."

"Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Steven Adams?  Seriously though they have something like 17 or 18 FRP over the next 7 years right? I think given they have the contracts and good young players in Shai, Dort, etc they could realistically get 3 all star/2 superstar caliber players pretty easily."

that’s rich coming from Kevin durant.   &gt;	they just lack that competitive fire which is something
How do you think these things work? You think when teams lose a championship they aren’t immediately thinking of ways to get better and avoid losing happening again? Like I get what you’re trying to say but this “weak” is so dumb LMAO. They had a Golden opportunity to replace Harrison Barnes (who was god awful that series BTW) with Kevin fucking Durant and pounced on quickly like any smart person would
"&gt; I was like, 'What the f--k? Who do y'all think I am? Do y'all think Draymond would hang out with me over at the conference finals?'  LMFAO bruh we think you're Kevin Durant, after a weak ass move like that nothing is off the table tbh"
so if he performed better in every other finals wouldn't that mean that KD made his job easier as well? as lethal as Steph is at the end of the day he's limited physically and i think that's why he needed Kevin Durant to win those last two
Counterpoint: Kevin Durant  Fuck that teams stacked
Young children aren't going to have a fucking clue who Kevin Durant is just like how they don't know who Kobe Bryant is now.
"https://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/16791990/nba-changes-led-kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-thunder Also in this article, its pretty clear that KD was undecided all year lol He pretty blatantly bragged about re-signing with OKC at the start of that season:  &gt; He had just met newly hired Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan. Durant was pushing through rehab and edging closer to returning to the court. He was fired up. He sent a text. ""It's our year next year!"" he said.  &gt; He sent another.  &gt; ""Then Ima sign back and build a sick ass house and keep stacking chips!! That's [the] goal."""
"Lmao, people in 15 years are going to know who fucking Kevin Durant is"
"One of the craziest thing KD said right after signing with golden state was that he was happy warriors lost in game 7 vs the cavs, because only with that result he could've make the move he wanted to do.     &gt;As they lost, it became more and more  real every day. You start to think about it even more. To see if I would  fit. Then once I sat down with these guys, everything that I wanted to  know about them, they kinda showed me. But we don't have to talk about  \[what would have happened if the Warriors had won the title\], because  they didn't get the job done, and they came after me.   I guess you could say I'm glad that they lost.

"Probably not, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see CP3 making a huge difference that series."
did he really?  the only article I can find is this one where it says he put his house up for sale in oct  2015 for almost half the price he bought it for  https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kevin-durant-relists-oklahoma-home/
"A lesser version of Kevin Durant with superior playmaking. He has the tools and appears to have better court vision than KD did early in his career.   Surely he won't reach that level, but if he does..."
LaVine before this season   28% for his career from 3-10 ft   30% from 10-16 ft  36% from 16-22 ft   48% on 2 pointers in general   A guy like this isnt suddenly going to become Chris Paul or Kevin Durant from this range like his %s were at a point earlier this year. Regression was inevitable.
"Well her name is Durant so perhaps he took her name. Happens a lot with kids that have split parents.   Besides, there's no law saying you HAVE to be named after your father, could have been Kevin Smith if they felt like it."
"You mean people cant fathom how a guy who had to get held back from trying to fight Steve Kerr over him yelling fuck you, [who repeatedly had to be restrained from going at teammates](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17790252/golden-state-draymond-green-problem), and who got suspended [by his own team by how he overreacted in a confrontation with Kevin Durant](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-kevin-durant-argument-suspension-what-did-they-say-report) doesnt lose it sometimes, go overboard and get sensitive. As a general reddit rule people always will look for reasons to be pedantic and argue ""well actually!!"" about how these things dont mean that but the point is obvious."
"Gotta feel bad for the Kings. They haven't finished a season over .500 since 2006.  For clarification, that was LeBron's first year in the playoffs.   Chris Paul, Derron Williams, and Andrew Bogut made the All-Rookie team that year.   Clifford Robinson and Kevin Willis were still kicking around.   LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Lowry, and J. J. Reddick weren't even in the league at that time.   Al Horford and Joakim Noah were teammates in college. Kevin Durant was a year away from declaring for the draft.   Derrick Rose was still in high school.   Blake Griffin was 5 years away from playing his first NBA game.   Antony Davis was still in GRADE school.   Luka would have been in the second grade!  LaMelo Ball would have been in pre-school.  &amp;#x200B;  THAT'S how long it has been since the Kings were over .500.   &amp;#x200B;  :-("
Didn't someone throw it in the stands and break sometimes glasses??  Edit. Durant punched it https://theundefeated.com/whhw/kevin-durant-reaches-out-to-vet-who-got-hit-when-ball-flew-into-stands/
"Maybe, but I don't think the Heat's scenario with Jimmy/Bam/Harden+ G Leaguers would have been nearly as good as the Net's Situation with Kyrie/Harden +good role players and Kevin Durant coming back eventually."
"Yup. Even as a high volume player at full health in 2019, Griffin only had 37 dunks, because he was shouldering the Pistons' entire offense from the high post and perimeter all season (and did an incredible job, hence the All-NBA Third Team honor).   Blake couldn't play off of guys like Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant in Detroit. Instead, we kind of needed and expected him to be all of those dudes on his own."
just shut the fuck up kevin durant
“I’m Kevin Durant”
Kevin. Durant.
"I wonder this myself. But the question is just to the voters. Their decision.  2012 - injured  2013 - he was a good first option and co-lead playmaker in the good Warriors team. He played really well. He was in the discussion for third team, but there was no big event to push him over the established stars. First team was Chris Paul, who had a great season on both ends so easy choice, and Kobe, because obviously, he's Kobe.  2014 - this season it was pretty much accepted Curry is something else, but also there is a lot of competition on the guard positions. Chris Paul again is an obvious choice as a leader, defender, point god etc., and Curry lost the first team All-NBA by a few votes to Harden. Why? Good question. Hard to say. Harden had a bit more points per game (a bit more minutes) and Rockets had a bit better record.  2017, 18 - Durant came and that kinda put the perceived ""value"" of Curry in the NBA culture down a lot. Nothing is more influential to the awards than being the only star in your team and GSW was now a team with Kevin Durant. That's it, he was playing just as good individually.  2020 - injured again  2021- yeah look around. The Warriors are too weak, when they were a few games above .500 Curry seemed a favorite for the first team All-NBA."
"it doesn't have to be as formal as classifying someone a villain or a hero, a lot of it happens in isolated incidents. a lot of the incidents come from the most innocuous of moments, too  a recent example is that quote from steve kerr deliberately being taken out of context on twitter, making it sound as if kerr specifically was saying that kevin durant was the reason he 'didn't enjoy' that last season with him as much as he did the warriors' tanking seasons  when michael jordan accurately said that steph curry 'isn't in the hall of fame yet' which is literally true, in response to a hypothetical all-time starting lineup of hall of famers he'd choose, it was reported as though jordan was saying that curry wasn't 'hall of fame caliber'   there are so many simple examples of media-engineered hysteria, it just is what it is"
"Yeah, after seeing Kevin Durant play that well against the Raptors, there's no way the Raptors win if Kevin stayed healthy. Sure was nice to see Raptors win. What a great experience."
I mean that's still kevin durant lmao
Kevin Durant with the FACTZ
Because he gets hurt a lot and has played on teams with Kevin Durant
"Where’s the implosion of the locker room I was promised? Where’s the drama? Oh wait. That shit doesn’t fly in Brooklyn. That’s called culture.   The identity of any decent building or company or organization doesn’t fade with new members. That’s why they’re a good organization. That’s why they went to the nets.  Also where else could Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have signed at the same time? Like 3 other places lol one of them being the Knicks. That’s called intelligent planning and recruiting. That’s called being a good organization.  Don’t be upset that Tillman wouldn’t trade harden to the sixers, or Houston’s awful front office. You’re just a hater bro"
"I disagree so much with this statement. First off, we're comparing two different parts of the league when comparing the tanking era and the superteam(read: Kevin Durant) era. The former involves a handful of teams racing to the bottom. Who really cares if a team tries to lose and wins 10, or if they try to win and win 20? They're trash in both scenarios. There's very little entertainment value in watching the bottom teams of the league compared to the top teams. They don't have the stars and they don't have the highlights.      The latter involves the teams everyone cares about, the teams competing for a title. These are the teams that really matter for an individual season. They have the best players, best coaches, best games, and are actually in the playoffs. Disrupting the balance between these teams is far more damaging to the league than a few shitty teams becoming really shitty teams. When KD joined the Warriors (and now looking it's like the Nets might be there 2nd coming) he completely ruined every other teams' chances at winning the title. The Warriors were foregone champions barring injuries. It ruined how entertaining the league was. It hasn't come close to that 2016 season ever since.   It is not better ""for sure""."
"Idk why you were downvoted. It's a valid feeling  to be relieved to not face Kevin Durant in the playoffs,"
His dad wrote an open letter to KD on Father's Day too: https://theundefeated.com/features/wayne-pratt-a-letter-to-my-son-kevin-durant-on-fathers-day/
"I don’t think think anyone actually hates the nets themselves, just the fact that everyone flocked there all of a sudden. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving going over there didn’t really get anyone in their feelings (I don’t think) but watching harden force a trade to a contender then seeing two solid veterans get bought out so they can ring chase just kinda sucks as a viewer.   Doesn’t make what the players or the team did wrong, and the viewers aren’t necessarily wrong either. Just kinda sucks a little is all"
"Once again Kevin Durant ruins everything.  But seriously, congrats to the nets on a great game. They look scary af."
"Kevin ""2x Finals MVP"" Durant"
"Kevin Durant in his return currently 15 points in 13 minutes on 100% shooting.  Okayyyy buddy, come back to Seattle?"
"I just love how they casually subbed in Kevin Durant at the end of the half, it’s like they’re playing MyTeam"
"It’s crazy that they are doing this while only having Kevin Durant, Kyrie, Blake Griffin who can suddenly play again, Aldridge, Joe Harris and other solid role guys."
I get nervous every time Kevin Durant hops around on one foot
Kevin durant and 4 mugsy bogues would beat a team of lebron james and 4 mugsy Bogues in a best of 7 series.
"You're right, whether it's PF or C, there's always been skilled and great bigs playing--it's just that the positions have really evolved throughout the years. This is nephew-level take from OP. The back-to-back MVP is a big who is fast and skilled like a wing, and has playmaking abilities. In 2017-18: Anthony Davis was third, Giannis sixth, and Durant seventh in votes. In 2013-14, Joakim Noah was fourth in votes. In 2012-13, Tim Duncan was seventh in votes. In 2011-12, Kevin Love was sixth and Dwight Howard seventh in votes. In 2010-11, Dwight Howard was second and Dirk sixth in votes.  OP is romanticizing this too much. It was only eight years removed when Noah was a point-center in the MVP discussion, just not as good as Jokic. A lot of bigs have adapted a perimeter game and some play like a wing (or are wings but are tall like centers). Either way, the ""bigs"" are not likely to go away; they'll just keep adapting and evolving."

"&gt;Lmao. Did you really just say that?      This is embarrassing, ROTY is always and historically about Volume &gt;&gt;&gt; Efficiency. Winning has also never been a factor in ROTY. Lebron was shooting 40% as a rookie, some of the best scorers of all time in Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and more also were inefficient rookies. Its clear you dont know how this award works."
"But neither Brown or Tatum are Kevin Durant or Harden.  I mean we can recognize the gulf of difference between those right? Both Perennial top 5 players with MVPs to their names versus 2 young all stars?  &gt; Kemba's also been available for essentially the past 3 months.  This isn't a positive, he was quite literally garbage his first 2 months back.  &gt;I wasn't expecting them to be 1st seed but being under .500 at this stage of the season is crazy.  You can say they are underperforming (which they absolutely are) without getting silly with comparisons to the Nets who are without a doubt one of the deepest and quite possibly the most talented team in the league."
You’re comparing Dan Marleje to Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant about to scoop his ass up too.
The Nets only care about the playoffs. If Kevin Durant says he feels 99% healthy the Nets would put him in street clothes for another 2 weeks.

I don't follow NBA all that much. I know that Klay Thompson is injured and Kevin Durant left. But still: How come they suck so hard now when they dominated just 3 years ago?
"People love to tout accomplishments of players when they're playing, but the first and most important ability is availability.  Steph and especially KD are not durable players.  The Warriors lost the 2019 NBA Finals primarily because their best player, Kevin Durant, got injured in game 1.  The Nets were a 7-seed in 2020 because their best player, Kevin Durant, was out for the whole season.  The 2015 Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs because their best player, Kevin Durant, was injured for most of the season.  In the 2016 playoffs Steph Curry's play regressed a fair amount from his regular season MVP performance - rolling his ankle and being injured for 6 playoff games likely didn't do him any favors.  James Harden has **never** had a significant injury - I was legitimately shocked to see the news that Harden will be out for at least 10 days with a hamstring injury.  I would bet that if the playoffs were today, Harden would play through it.  But I cannot remember a time where Harden had to miss more than a week because of injury.  Sure, when they play at full health, Durant and Curry may be better than Harden.  But the only player in the past 10 years anyone can argue is anywhere near as durable as Harden is Lebron.  Doesn't this count for something?"
Somebody like Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. But that would just be silly.
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.

"&gt; Literally one of these proposed trades gives the Ws 4 legit starters next season. You’re glossing over that. Right now you’re talking about Oubre and Wiseman. Replace both with Klay and the player brought in.  First of all, speculating that the Warriors would be able to land Beal or KAT is extremely optimistic. If they believed those trades were plausible, they would certainly have tried to make them happen when they still had a drift pick instead of Wiseman.  Secondly, it assumes Klay is going to come back as the Klay he was two years ago, before two very serious injuries. While it certainly isn't impossible, it's not the likely otucome.   &gt;GS hasn’t designed this team around Steph that’s pretty damn clear dude.  You cannot be serious.   &gt;The Celtics have basically missed their window for a title being stingy.   They missed their window by swinging big with Hayward and him not working out as well as they hoped.   &gt;The Sixers have taken huge risks and seen it pay off.   The Sixers have gotten nowhere. They have two second round and one first round exit. How the fuck is that *paying off*?  The Celtics have gotten to the Conference finals in 3 out of 4 seasons, and the Sixers have gotten there 0 out of 4 seasons. And you think Celtics failed, and Sixers succeeded?  WTF?  &gt;Same with the Lakers.  What risk did the Lakers take? LeBron decided he wanted to retire in Beverly Hills, and he and Rich Paul built the team once he was there.  What risk was involved in signing LeBron, a guaranteed Top 3 all-time NBA player?   &gt;Same with the Nets.  Again, what risks did they take? They had KD and Kyrie Irivng *picking them* as a destination, due to their connection with Sean Marks. There is virtually zero risk in signing those two players.   &gt;Same with the Raptors during their title year. You have to take risks.   Again, what risk? The Raptors had a contending team before, and was able to trade for one of the best players in the league for vastly inferior players?   All of your examples are risk-averse moves.   &gt;If you think trading project players for an impact player is a bad answer I can’t help you.  Nobody thinks trading project players and drift picks for someone like LeBron, Kawhi  or Kevin Durant would be a bad answer. However, there's no such trades available for the Warriors.  Whatever you end up trading for is going to be significantly inferior to those trades.   &gt;There’s no upside to building long term unless your goal was to Alienate or trade Steph  The goal should be doing whatever is best for the team. Whether that ends up pleasing or alienating Steph is secondary.   If you can actually find a Top 5 player you can trade for with Wiseman, Wiggins and draft picks, then for sure, you do that.  If the trade you can find is a Top 25(ish) player who still doesn't get you there, then yeah, maybe it's rebuild time."
Bro they don’t need Kevin Durant
"It's like saying ""what did Jimi Hendrix do better than Stevie Ray Vaughan""? One was the trailblazer that set the blueprint for KD to pursue jump shooting because otherwise he would have been relegated to a post presence. Legacy aside, Dirk's ranking is heavily influenced by a historical postseason run as the focal point of the offense - the next best offensive weapon was Jason Terry. Kevin Durant has always had an all-NBA level offensive talent next to him in the playoffs, which allows him the privilege of better spacing and thus higher efficiency."
Because Draymond can be an overbearing jerk. He already drove Durant off the team.   Just because he knows the game well himself doesn’t mean that he can teach it effectively to others or is a good mentor.   We already see reports of Wiseman talking to Kevin Durant daily....probably because he reached out to him on how to deal with being bullied by Draymond.
Kevin Durant or Giannis
"Volume &gt;&gt; Efficiency when it comes to ROY. Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Wiggins, MCW all won ROY with below average efficiency. Edwards is improving and at his pace, yeah he will still win ROTY based off of how the award is historically."
"I know Kevin Durant and a few others played with him over the summer, they said he looked like his old self."
"looking forward to 30 for 30's ""Kevin Durant: Thots &amp; Prayers"""
"I agree, Giannis on a team with absolutely no depth sounds like a nightmare. But on the topic of depth and ring chasing, remind me which team included Kevin Durant, Matt Barnes, Varejao, and Ian Clark? Sounds like an incredibly deep team right? Lol."
If you're a 7ft center whose name is not Kevin Durant you should not be trying to cross someone over and do a spin move which inevitably leads to a charge or a turnover.   Like he's got some handles but he's definitely trying to play above his level. Those moves might work on high schoolers but it's not going to fly against an NBA defense.
that’s just kevin durant
"So we gonna cancel Pail Pierce for smoking weed bug Kevin Durant gets to be a racist, homophobic fuck head and only gets fined?   Shit is getting out of hand."
But Kevin Durant is still employed.  OKAY.
"**Most recent championship runs**  Kevin Durant averaged 29.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists on 49/34/90 in 21 games in the 2018 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  Kawhi Leonard averaged 30.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 49/38/88 in 24 games in the 2019 playoffs. He won his second Finals MVP award and his second NBA championship.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  -------  **Most recent playoff runs**   Kawhi Leonard averaged 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds and 5.5 assists on 49/33/86 in 13 games in the 2020 playoffs.  Kevin Durant averaged 32.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists on 51/44/90 in 12 games in the 2019 playoffs.  LeBron James averaged 27.6 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.8 assists on 56/37/72 in 21 games in the 2020 playoffs. He won his fourth Finals MVP award and his fourth NBA championship.  --------   Keep in mind here that Kawhi's stats are similar, arguably better (depending on what you value), without being on a superteam or even having a fellow superstar on his team (in my opinion, Paul George is borderline, not a superstar but a star. If you think he's a superstar, that's fine, but he's undeniably worse than Curry/AD. KD and LeBron have had better teams around them than Kawhi has). Kawhi's Raptors/Clippers supporting cast pale in comparison to LeBron's Cavs/Heat/Lakers and KD's Thunder/Warriors/Nets.   Again, everything except the stats are OPINIONS, and I have my own, and you can have your own. Please stop following me around and being weird about this. It's just basketball man"
This sub hates Kevin Durant more than anything I've seen in real life  According to people on here everyone hates him for joining the Warriors but I've never seen anyone in real life still be obsessed with that by now
Kevin Durant did it against tougher competition
We got have concede that this is more of a millennial thing than anything else. People klno where near as notable as Kevin Durant running around with multiple accounts here
You know you done fucked up if Kevin Durant is telling you to grow up
Kevin Durant actually hits those game cheesing runners at an unrealistic clip just like in 2k lmao
Jabari Parker was our best Kevin Durant defender tonight.  Let that sink in.
Since when is Kevin durant a part of Brooklyn’s big 4?
I would 100% put all my money on marcus smart if he and kevin durant fought.
"crazy what Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden wanting to live in NYC can do for your franchise right!"
Kevin “AimBot” Durant
"After hours of statistical analysis I have determined with statistical significance at alpha&lt;.05 that all Kyrie Andrew Irving, Kevin Wayne Durant, and James Edward Harden Jr are all good at the game of basketball."
"It's probably already been said but this is a very ""I'm Kevin Durant, you know who I am"" game"
"Steve Nash doesn’t get enough credit for developing unknown talents like James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving"
Bro we have fucking Evan Fournier guarding Kevin durant and a rookie in Kyrie lmao our roster is hurting so bad rn
"kevin ""elite defense"" durant"
"At 23 Kevin Durant put up 30ppg on 65ts% against the Heat in the Finals. Think he also had a couple scoring titles by that point, two or three, cant recall. In other words, Tate has some catching up to do."
"It’s so crazy how it’s actually a debate on who’s the best player on the nets, james harden or Kevin Durant. That’s so ridiculous lol having 2 of the best players the last decade on 1 team."
"“Harden drives, he kicks it to the corner to Kevin Durant, the defense doubles KD, KD kicks it to Joe Harris, Joe Harris is picked up! Joe kicks it to Kyrie for a 3!”  Defense: Fuck this shit"
Kevin Durant ridiculous shot
"Lol what is this ridiculous comment?  Steph got to the playoffs with his best offensive teammate being Andrew Wiggins. Once Wiseman went down the Warriors had no right making the playoffs  Yet here you are bragging about Harden elevating a roster made up of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Joe Harris and generally a much stronger bench than what the Warriors are supporting Steph with  And some people think I'm too harsh when I say this subreddit has to have the lowest sports IQ of any subreddit on this site. This shit you said is just ignorant garbage"
"If anyone in the east truly believes they can beat a trio of James Harden,Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant then I feel bad for you"
Kevin Durant is so good it seems unfair. The man is a cheat code. Big ups Durant.
I like how irving left the cavs because he wanted to be a focal point and ended up playing alongside kevin durant and james harden.
Kevin Durant made a movie nobody saw
Kevin Durant is good at basketball!
Kevin Durant is top dawg.
Headband Marcus&gt; Kevin durant
I’ll choose to hate Paul George and Justin Jackson over Kevin Durant any day of the week
"Seriously, though, this is a nice list at SF...   Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Chris Mullin, Andre Iguodala, Bernard King, Juan Toscano Anderson   It might be top 5"
Kevin Durant might be cool
&gt; KD is Kevin Durant  This is a hyperbole I can get behind.
"I remember when we  were 12, my best friend was a huge Texas fan and was obsessed with Kevin Durant. He bought, traded for, and bartered our whole school and more for dozens of KD rookie cards. He even got a lot of them sealed and rated. I wonder if this will make him much money some day haha"
"Lmao Perk ain't kicking nobody's ass man get that shit outta here. Haslem and Oakley have been calling Perk soft for damn near a decade now. He's a soft ass fucking dude. Kevin Durant called him a sell out and his bitch ass was out here crying on national TV, that's the dude you think is going to punk anybody?"
Would you rather he play against Kevin fucking Durant?
"Okay , I hear you. But were those people that have tried to attack Curry named Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie?   Cause this is a whole different level than someone on a random Tuesday in January trying to iso Curry"
Kevin Durant has entered the chat.
"Nah unless you’re a player fan you would feel different. But if you’re a loyal fan of a team, you love guys like Dame. In a league of Kevin Durant types, people love the loyalty he shows. That’s always gonna be a plus for fans of the league"
"Yeah the whole ""buBbLe FrAUd hEaT cUlTuRe"" circlejerk for the last day has been tiring. Its the only thing that really bothers me about this sub; feels like theres a sizable portion of people here who dont actually care about basketball, they are just here to jump on whatever hate bandwagon is currently active. They get their memes and copypasted comments ready and just sit on r/new until whatever team/player that is currently the hate target loses. Clippers, Paul George, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Trae Young etc. It goes way beyond legitimate criticism and just ends up being a circlejerk where the frontpage will be covered with just ""x team/player sucks"" for a couple days and the comment sections are worse than twitter replies. Like when this sub turned into the official Paul George haters club for a week before suddenly remembering caring about mental health. I come here for basketball and memes, not to see the sub used as megaphone for venting your personal frustrations.       Like look at the posts yesterday when Miami lost, literally within seconds I saw people posting long ass hate comments they had clearly typed out in advance and were just waiting to copypaste spam the PGT with. Like how fucking sad is that? We had like 10 different frontpage posts that were all shitting on Miami or Butler in some form. Comment sections just full of insanely bitter 76ers/Bucks/Celtics fans that have apparently been seething since the last playoffs and waiting for their chance to do some hating.  Like yeah it was kinda embarrasing for the Heat to get swept, but did they really do anything that bad to get this level of hate? Saying that you are locked in is too arrogant? Losing against the reigning MVP and DPOY who just added Jrue+Tucker to an already solid roster? I can understand getting some shadeunfreude after getting your ass beat last year, but cmon man it gets embarrasing when you got Raptors flairs out here spamming comments about how embarrasing and trash the Heat are whilst finishing 12th. Even the official Bucks twitter account out here being petty posting cocky fan tweets that hade like 3 likes on em, like thats not something you can dig up from every fanbase on twitter.    If the Clippers end up losing I will prob just unsub cause the amount of concentrated hate in this subreddit will be enough to literally resurrect Hitler."
*Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant have entered the chat*
"Harden adds to the presence oversea as I think he is popular in china. The nets can have a big presence as their best three players are famous. Anyone who follows the NBA knows who Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden are.  We will see how long they stay with the Brooklyn Nets.   Knicks will always be New York's team as they have been bad for many years and still have a big loyal following that the Nets do not have in New York."
...Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant dropped 30+ppg in the finals on LeBron and won FMVP.
"Kevin Durant is better imo, I feel like that’s an unpopular opinion but Durant is the more talented player to me"
I do not agree with you. The Knicks are much  bigger than the Nets in New York. It is a big gap when it comes to enthusiasm between the two franchise. You can see the fans in Madison square garden and how they reacted to the New York Knicks winning a play off game.  I saw a comment say that Derrick rose is bigger in New York than Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.  People in New York still care more about the Knicks than the Nets even though the Brooklyn Nets have a much better basketball team.
"I've thought about this question quite a lot. Lebron is the easy answer. But I think possibly the only guy in history whose five would have no weaknesses would be Kevin Durant. Getting the ball up the court with handles, rebounding, shooting from any spot, enough size to protect the hoop and not get posted up, the Snake Clones could do it all.  The Lebron's would probably win it all, but at 6'8"" ish they would have some trouble inside against 5 Giannis's or 5 Kevin Garnett's."
Kevin Durant
Joel Embiid is shooting at Kevin Durant levels from the mid range this season my guy.

"Look no one roots for refs, and we all acknowledge them when they make mistakes, or when they let their egos get in the way.  But I'm really sick of players bitching and whining and pouting at refs CONSTANTLY, and generally acting like immature brats.  Think about it in these contexts:  NBA players are ***so vain*** that they absolutely refuse to shoot free throws underhanded, even though it would improve their opportunities to win and would maximize their scoring output\*.\*  *But...*  they are not too vain to flop around faking contact while making goofy, histrionic faces and looking ridiculous.  Also, NBA players are ***so sensitive to perceived embarrassment,***  such as getting dunked on, that they will literally sprint away from the paint and run out frame rather than contest a layup.  *But...*  they routinely court embarrassment, game in &amp; game out, behaving like bratty children whining at refs after EVERY. SINGLE. PLAY.  It's so uncool. It's so unlikable.  &amp;#x200B;  Kobe shaking his head at refs vociferously with his pursed lips and his nose in the air, or Tim Duncan with his bulging eyes pleading with his hands up, or LeBron scrunching his face up in utter hysterics, or Draymond skrieking 6 inches from a ref's face with spittle flying all over the place, or Dwyane Wade &amp; Kevin Durant fake laughing about a call acting with phony mock indignation. Luka literally does all of these!  I don't know when exactly every NBA star each developed their own signature ""bitching at the refs"" move they use 50 times a game, but it's one of the worst parts about watching."

That fan you ask? Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
Many people. Even Kevin Durant.
"That’s my whole point and you clearly don’t watch Wiggins play. You would think he’s a below average shooter just by looking at boxscores, like yourself - clearly proving my point.   Basketball isn’t played in a boxscore.  Wiggins is an efficient scorer that takes bad shots which does not mean he’s a bad shooter. Kevin Durant is a better shooter than Lebron, but Lebron has a better career FG%. It’s why you can’t use 1 stat to prove someone is a better shooter.   My draymond point is that you’re using an unrelated statistic to prove a point. Yes, TS% has some indication in someone’s ability to shoot, but eFG, and raw shooting numbers is a better indication than TS%"
"Yes and no. Players can do what they want 100%, but players who try to intentionally harm the organization they're leaving, or are Kevin Durant, are assholes."
"reach how so? Is it that unfathomable that Kevin Durant who is an NBA MVP, 2 times Finals MVP, 4 time scoring champ and averaged 27, 7 and 6 on 54, 45, 88 shooting splits when he played this year while being a better defender is better than Harden? It's one thing to think Harden is better, but to think it's a reach that someone could think KD is better is a reflection of your lack of basketball iq."
"Most guys in the league don't win shit, especially with LeBron and KD constantly stacking the deck in their favor.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, six players have been the best player on a finals team - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Butler.  Since Jimmy's been in the league, the only players that have won shit are LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Tim Duncan, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kyle Lowry, and Anthony Davis."
"&gt;You must literally have a mental disability. I'm not saying this as an insult, but you start off with denying rip through fouls. The Kevin Durant rule. It was a big deal when it came about. Literally everyone is aware of it.  I am aware of the rip-through calls.  I am also aware that there is no justification for those calls in the NBA Rulebook.  If you cannot grasp the relatively simple point that the game must be played per the published rules, you are well beyond your depth here, and should not be attempting to insult anyone else."
"You must literally have a mental disability.  I'm not saying this as an insult, but you start off with denying rip through fouls. The Kevin Durant rule. It was a big deal when it came about. Literally everyone is aware of it."
Kevin Durant is hated unless he goes against LeBron. Then he is loved
He wants to be Kevin Durant. That's the problem.
Wilt never had to win a play in before beating Kevin Durant. Lost a lot of respect for him after I found out.
"Because Kevin Durant violates the offensive foul rule all the time and Smart takes advantage of the charge rule. One is legal, the other isn’t. You don’t have to like either, but at least one is allowed for in the rule book, for the exact reason of preventing people from doing what Durant did. But he still got the call lol it was a complete joke of a call and everyone knows it."

"Really happy the Celtics didnt just lay down, if we can force this to six games I’ll count it as a huge win.  But if I’m Brooklyn I’m fucking terrified of Philly and Milwaukee.

Embiid will get unlimited points against Blake, and they’re not about to wall off Giannis the way Miami did."

"This dude made a thread yesterday with the title:   &gt;Why is Kwame Brown loved for defending himself in social media, but Kevin Durant gets hate for doing it too?  He clearly has an agenda."
Is it? KD left in free agency.   Harden failed to show up to his team's training camp and instead was attending strip clubs during a global pandemic. He then proceeded to mail it in the first few weeks of the season and then forced his way out after getting bitched by the Lakers two games in a row. To top it all off his former team got next to nothing for him in the trade because he only wanted to go to a team with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.   The Rockets gave Harden everything he wanted. Morey was the most aggressive GM in the league during Harden's time there.   KD gave OKC 8 elite seasons before bolting.  Harden gave Houston 8 elite seasons before bolting.   Not sure how anyone can argue that what KD did was worse lol
Mind explaining how Kevin Durant has exhibited floor raising better than Curry.   No slander on Russ. Point is that he has been a floor raiser. He won MVP that way. But would you rank him over Curry?

The best modern comparison to Larry Bird is Kevin Durant.
"If Kevin Durant played this lineup, I'd bet my life savings he'd cry on the court."

Kevin Durant played in 19 of 24 quarters in that series.  Stop being disingenuous.

"It's really difficult to be a top 10 player in the league without being either an elite defender or an elite playmaker. Off the top of my head, KD's the only exception, and... I mean, he's fucking Kevin Durant, we all know why he's the exception. Kyrie's a godawful defender, and while he's definitely a *good* playmaker he's nowhere near the level of Steph, Harden, Luka, Jokic, or even Dame."
I have all too many.  &amp;#x200B;  But I have nobody who is at good at what they do as Steph Curry or Kevin Durant are good at basketball.
"Kinda Weird, mostly because of Bill Russell and Harden. But I don’t think mine is too much different.  PG: Chris Paul, close second is Nash  SG: Harden  SF: LeBron  PF: I’m just going to say Kevin Durant, even though I don’t think he’s ever been considered a PF. But If not him Tim Duncan  C: Hakeem"

Nets' Kevin Durant once again ruled out due to NBA health and safety protocols -Adam Silver
This same Kevin Durant who’s holding up on Steph switches got crossed up so bad by Draymond he didn’t even bother chasing after him a quarter earlier.
"Kevin Durant is the impact player with 8 points on 9 shots?  Yeah, not right now."
"&gt;You said ""a million"" when referring to the difference in lump sums, didja?  That'd be off by 100% even if it was relevant.  Better luck next time.   &gt;   &gt;And you neglected to answer the question, what happens at the expiration of the Nets' proposed contract?  Oh, trying to distract and pivot to the difference in lump sums without acknowledging that they were referred to as lump sums and not per-year pay? It's okay, we'll recap again.  *ME: When people discuss NBA contracts they talk about the lump sum.*  *YOU: Not when the contracts are different lengths, as they are here.*  *ME:* [*""The Warriors can offer Durant a five-year contract worth $221 million while other teams with sufficient salary cap space can offer him a four-year contract worth $164 million.""*](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/28/kevin-durant-warriors-knicks-nets-free-agency-rumors-max-contract)  Are they saying the yearly salary or the lump sum there?     &gt; Uh oh, someone has lost their temper. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get over it -- I doubt this is the first time you've embarrassed yourself online, and I bet it won't be the last, especially if you continue here.   Nope, I already labeled you that. To quote [myself earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lgfqq6/julius_erving_nearly_joined_kareem_and_bigo_in/gmsi4dq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)...  *""Great, call the people who published the sources and complain to them. I don't care that much about a random raging nephew.""*  That's what set you off.      &gt;you were caught talking out of your asshole about an episode that you have no knowledge of and spreading gossip  Nope, I told you I wouldn't take your opinion over actual sources and showed why your argument that Mikan wouldn't forget because he was a ""smart basketball player"" and a successful lawyer was wrong.  I just happened to do so by bringing up elements of how the brain functions that you knew nothing about.     &gt;Unrelated science of any sort is not supporting evidence.  Have you noticed that you can't decide between falsely claiming you're familiar with what I'm talking about and trying to dismiss it? You don't know whether to posture as knowledgeable to pretend that the knowledge doesn't matter.  :)  Actual studies of memory storage and neuroplasticity are direct supporting evidence of people's tendency to store memories when they're smart.  The rest of your two paragraphs there is just more spastic nephew rage without a point. You try to go ad hominem and posture because you can't actually discuss the phenomena in question. You just don't know anything about it.     &gt; You've insisted that Mikan forgot the check, when even your source doesn't say that, and in fact your source is obviously speculating with no evidence at all. As that source is known to do.   Oh I see, this is your argument, the source says Mikan ""froze or forgot"" and your big point is that I said forgot! So he might have just ""frozen""! But he didn't forget! Yup, he may have just had a muscle seizure for the whole meeting, that's a reasonable alternative and should have been listed.  LOL.     &gt; Only because of the eye-witnesses. A detail you like to ignore, without success.   That was already included as I said. Also when you get to the bottom of my post, you'll encounter another concept you know nothing about. It's the part where I say catastrophic subservience. It's a known phenomenon under various names. I even know the evolutionary dynamics and brain mechanisms that cause it.   I bet you don't know either one of those. :)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; With your completely imagined story, that I've repeatedly shown to be nonsense.   Here's the part where you tried to ignore me bringing up your key weakness. I told you to write your angry, frustrated, spastic little missives towards them. I'm doing this for my own amusement only, since despite your rage you can't challenge what I say.     &gt; A cheat sheet, you say? Exactly like one that Mikan could've used  Nope. Einstein had the sheet because he'd forget the physical constants. Mikan in this case forgot that part of the presentation entirely. If it helps, [Einstein also once gave an entire lecture at Princeton with his fly open.](https://youtu.be/3LU6kbao3vo?t=259) Entire important things can slip your mind due to how neuroplasticity works.  Your attempted equivocation was cute though. But you're not sophisticated enough to sneak anything like that by. Don't try.     &gt; Not everyone who is intelligent is forgetful. Therefore, those who are forgetful have a malady with respect to those who are not. This would be simple for you to understand, if you were in the intelligent cohort.   *You don't know what intelligence or forgetfulness even mean.* So nothing you try to say about it matters.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; How did Mikan become one of the most successful lawyers in Minnesota without a strategy for coping with the very serious forgetfulness that you claim he suffered from?  You can't figure out how because you don't know what people forget and don't forget, and not only that, you couldn't understand what I meant when I said it was a net BENEFIT to the person. They've overall stored MORE useful and relevant information than others, which is why their cup is filled to the brim. That's how you can be overall greater than the average while forgetting random things.     &gt;Who said anything about speaking out of turn? A simple elbow nudge to the pocket containing the check would've sufficed.    &gt;   &gt;And the meeting in question was a multi-hour outing, that included a shopping trip, so it's not like there were never opportunities for a quick, private word.  No, you just don't understand what you're talking about on any of this.  [""The NTSB was critical of the flight crew's monitoring of the approach, and even more critical of why the first officer and flight engineer did not challenge the captain for his errors.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Flight_801)  So yeah, if they won't challenge their captain until seconds before they're all dead, it's not far-fetched that other people at a meeting might not have said anything when Mikan didn't pull out a check.  You just don't know anything about any of this stuff. It's cute that you think neuroscience studies and known psychological phenomena aren't factual support though."
"Not sure who to root for in this one, I'm a fan of both Steph Curry and Kevin Durant."
"People know hardens scoring is way down but he’s also just not impacting game at close to a mvp level, maybe not even top 10 lvl.  I thought he be the 1b to durant even if he was scoring less than Kyrie but he’s closer to bkns Kevin love(people forget love had argument for top 5 in 2014)"
Greg oden. Tremendous potential. High school class of 2006. Microfracture knee surgery ended it all. Fortunately no one drafted me over Kevin Durant.
"Nah, it probably wouldnt have been okay because Kevin Durant was really only getting to join because of a fluke cap jump. Normally when teams like that form they got to gut the roster to make it happen at least so the balance isnt as fucked up as it appears.   But it would have been better. I'll never the Game 6 he played vs the Warriors when it looked like he was throwing the game lol."
"""W*e took huuge bet replacing Harrison Barnes with prime Kevin Durant.*  *Nobody could've imagined that we would've been better than the previous season.""*"
"i mean even as recently as the summer before he joined the thunders he [said the same thing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-kevin-durant-offered-advice-thunder/467406001/)  &gt; “I grew up a Lakers and a Clippers fan,” George said. “I idolized Kobe. There will always be a tie here, a connection here. People saying I want to come here, who doesn’t want to play for their hometown? That’s a dream come true, if you’re a kid growing up on the outskirts of L.A., to be the man in your city. But it’s definitely been overstated. For me, it’s all about winning. I want to be in a good system, a good team. I want a shot to win it. I’m not a stats guy. I’m playing this game to win and build a legacy of winning. I’ve yet to do that. I’m searching for it. If we get a killer season in Oklahoma, we make the conference finals or upset the Warriors or do something crazy, I’d be dumb to want to leave that.”  that whole article is actually a pretty decent read"
"""I'm rich and do what I love.  Don't cry for me."" - Kevin Durant"
You replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin durant
"As much as people make fun of KEVIN Durant for his hair, Pierce's beard is a travesty."
Casuals like Kevin Durant have Kobe at #2
You still have time to realize he's trolling given Kevin Durant of all people is his example.
"LeBron scored his 4,000th point in game 7 of his third year when he was still six weeks short of his 21st birthday. Kevin Durant reached 4,000 in his 19th game of year three, just two months after his 21st birthday."
Kevin Durant fans weird as fuck lmaooo
I have no idea about you’re talking about lmao seriously take your pills you can continue your Kevin Durant stanning another day
Nah you got over 500 upvotes on your initial comment even though it’s just you sucking off KD. Then people called you out for trying to sneak in KD outplaying Lebron and you got downvoted to hell for defending it. Damn I just realized you just pulled a Kevin Durant lmao
Kevin Durant coming to Boston if OKC doesn't choke against GS
"If I learned one thing in the Grit N Grind era, it's that defense is invisible to most fans and way too many TV ""analysts.""  Tony Allen would clamp KD and the storyline would be that Kevin Durant is a choker.  Like no, maybe TA is just an incredible  one on one defender?"

All of Kevin Durant’s shots are quality shots due the fact that it’s Kevin Durant taking them
No bro. They had to figure out how to replace Harrison Barnes' minutes with Kevin Durant. That cant be easy. /s
"&gt;I guess someday, after you've learned to read, you'll realize that the differing contract lengths are explicitly mentioned there. And wow, I'm super impressed that you spent your time searching the internet for one counter-example -- and still failed at that.  Ooh I see, so trying to lie about the topic, now? We were talking about whether they use per year money or the total amount. Let's recap.  *ME: When people discuss NBA contracts they talk about the lump sum.*  *YOU: Not when the contracts are different lengths, as they are here.*  *ME:*  [*""The Warriors can offer Durant a five-year contract worth $221 million while other teams with sufficient salary cap space can offer him a four-year contract worth $164 million.""*](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/28/kevin-durant-warriors-knicks-nets-free-agency-rumors-max-contract)  Are they saying the yearly salary or the lump sum there? Don't think you'll avoid it either. If you keep trying to do so I'll just pin you down to this issue.  &gt;""We""? Are you having a psychotic episode over this now? Again, it's long since time for you skulk away and hide again.  I see you've never heard of the ""royal we"" as used when speaking to plebians and when giving academic explanations to those who don't understand. :)  &gt;First off, learn what emoticons are for. Using them at all in an adult discussion -- that you are trying and failing to have here -- is pathetic, but misusing them is even worse. What is this, your first week on the internet?  You don't even know about a ""we"" grammatical construction, so nice try there. Also, I'm glad that you're upset about me not taking you seriously. That's why I'm smiling at you. :)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Second, you imagine that Mikan suffers from the same malady that you do, with absolutely zero supporting evidence. Furthermore, forgetting a cashier's check for a million dollars is nothing like being, say, unable to remember the molecular weight of cobalt. When you grow up, you may learn what a cashier's check is. It's not something that you want to just lose track of, because it's nearly cash.  Fail right off the bat. Neuroplasticity is not a ""malady,"" it's a standard feature of the brain that has predictable results at high levels.  This is the danger of you trying to argue about something you don't understand. It's also why you never should have said you were familiar with it. You're not. You clearly know nothing about the issue.  &gt;Someone with that inability to remember extremely important information would have a very difficult time becoming successful in multiple fields where timely recall of such information is critical.  Ooh I see, so is this your critique of the concept of neuroplasticity and storage abnormalities in the brain? That people who display it could never be successful in multiple fields or fields where timely recall is important?  I don't think you know what actually causes things not to be remembered in those cases. This is where you actually have to have some grounding as to the neural functions that shape and store memory, so you'd know what never gets forgotten by highly intelligent people and what easily slips their mind. If you did you would never have said that. :)  Or you can tell me why that storage mechanism doesn't function the way neuroscientist have determined it does and provide an alternate method, with evidence of course, with an equally compelling evo-psych explanation to go with it?  &gt;Third, and most damning to your forgotten-check fantasy is that Mikan did not go to that meeting alone. So now your whole ridiculous premise rests on multiple people suffering identical bouts of forgetfulness, simultaneously.  That was already covered in the actual published source. The one you clearly know nothing about and haven't read. :)  &gt;You're back to recycling this pathetic argument? That's weak even by your subterranean standard. You are again forgetting the other half of that statement, which was ""successful lawyer"".  Nice, you forgot that I responded to both your time-wasting and ignorance-exposing reference to Mikan being a smart basketball player AND your claim that he was a successful lawyer, then act like I didn't say it! You're having a hard time keeping track of this convo. I think we know why, also.  &gt;There is no evidence that Mikan suffered from your malady, and there is plenty of evidence that neuroplasticity had nothing at all to do with this negotiation, despite your desperate and sad little fantasy.   &gt;   &gt;Please post some references to your studies of known patterns of multiple people forgetting the same thing, simultaneously, due to their high neuroplasticity. If you knew a tenth of what you claim, you'd realize that's well nigh impossible.  No no. You told me you were familiar with what I was explaining to you about neuroplasticity. So go ahead and show me what you know. You already tripped up by saying it's a ""malady."" Dead wrong. Unless you've got some evidence that high neuroplasticity is a ""malady"" or classified as a disorder or debilitating condition , you've already shown that you're in way over your head.  Why don't you quote the DSM-5 and show me where it's listed?  Or you can show me where and why the work that's been done establishing these patterns is invalid, and what's been done that's established your version, that ""smart = good memory for all information in all fields."" LOL.  Or you can tell me Einstein wasn't smart enough to display the memory you're trying to attribute to ""smart"" Mikan?     &gt;Welcome to the internet.  Welcome to your personal nightmare where you're stuck trying to argue with someone who knows far more than you do about everything involved and instantly sees through all your evasive tactics and won't let you ignore points. You deserve it with your little Reddit nephew attitude.  :)"

Again, it's long since time for you skulk away and hide again.  &gt;By ""imagined"" you mean that's credibly sourced. You claimed it wasn't credible because Mikan was unlikely to forget due to your reasons which showed you have a poor understanding of how the brain works.

Fourth, again, we have eye witness accounts that contradict your little fantasy.  &gt;It's unrelated to *basketball*.

That's weak even by your subterranean standard.  You are again forgetting the other half of that statement, which was ""successful lawyer"".  &gt;Now now, don't get scared on me. You said you were quite familiar with what I was describing about neuroplasticity. But you claimed that Mikan, being smart and a successful lawyer, wouldn't have forgotten the check. Which contradicts known patterns of behavior among people with high neuroplasticity.  There is no evidence that Mikan suffered from your malady, and there is plenty of evidence that neuroplasticity had nothing at all to do with this negotiation, despite your desperate and sad little fantasy.  Please post some references to your studies of known patterns of multiple people forgetting the same thing, simultaneously, due to their high neuroplasticity.

You are still missing the point, unsurprisingly.  Re-read the above response as many times as it takes, for it to sink in.  Should probably only take you a few more days.  &gt;You're stuck. :)  Welcome to the internet."
"&gt;Holy hell -- I thought you finally skulked back under whatever rock you've been living under, but no, you're back to embarrass yourself further.  Some days I actually have better things to do then just bully you for my amusement.     &gt; Not when the contracts are different lengths, as they are here.

The original claims being that I wasn't going to trust a random fit-throwing Redditor over a published source and that it's very believable that Mikan would forget the check. We're still beating you up over those. In fact this is all part of it. :)     &gt; Because the eyewitness accounts completely contradict your imagined story.   By ""imagined"" you mean that's credibly sourced. You claimed it wasn't credible because Mikan was unlikely to forget due to your reasons which showed you have a poor understanding of how the brain works. You claim now that you're ""familiar"" with what I said, so show me how the studies on it are wrong.  Go on, I dare you. :)     &gt; That's the best ad hominem attack you could come up with, after two days of stewing about your failure here?   No, ad hominem attacks are what YOU need because this conversation quickly went way over your head and you're falling apart on even basic things like how the standard when talking about NBA contracts is to use lump sums (you won't be getting away from that). You use the ad hominems as a way to try to discourage me from continuing to harm your confidence and reputation by dismantling what you say. It won't work, I know you've got nothing. I could attack you back if I felt like it, with actual sting because you know I'm the more knowledgeable person here, but it's not a necessity.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Again, for the nth time, negotiating contracts is not an ""unrelated area"" to law. That you are unable to grasp this simple point means you desperately need to discontinue here. Read an occasional book, and learn something.   It's unrelated to *basketball*. You said Mikan wouldn't forget the check because he's one of the smartest *basketball* players ever, which I said was irrelevant just like how Einstein was known to be terrible at sailing despite being a great physicist.  It's okay, you're having trouble keeping track of the conversation, I know. But don't think that your own confusion is a problem for me. I understand these things very clearly.     &gt;You are still woefully unable to understand the point. No one is arguing that people never forget things -- caused by neuroplasticity or otherwise. The point is that Mikan did not forget the check in his pocket, and we have reliable eye witness accounts explaining exactly what happened, and why.   &gt;   &gt;You got caught talking out of your asshole on subject that you were uninformed about, when you told this nonsense, long-since-discounted gossip about a forgotten check. I was forced to illustrate your ignorance, and since then, you've been running scared, trying to hide behind your imagined diagnosis of the brain of a man you never met, and knew extremely little about -- until I educated you on that, as well.   &gt;   &gt;The lesson you should learn here is, don't talk out of your ass on subjects you know nothing about.   &gt;   &gt;Better luck next time.  Now now, don't get scared on me. You said you were quite familiar with what I was describing about neuroplasticity. But you claimed that Mikan, being smart and a successful lawyer, wouldn't have forgotten the check. Which contradicts known patterns of behavior among people with high neuroplasticity.  So you can either admit you're NOT familiar with those things, or you can tell me why the studies and information on that is wrong.  Losing your composure and cursing and trying to posture and call me names and pretend that you're the smart one here (I think we both know the truth), isn't going to do it, and I won't let you.  You're stuck. :)"
Kevin Durant also isn't exactly your average NBA player from a mental aspect as seen by his actions in the past.  you can attack your critics just fine in these covid-19 season from anonymous accounts just as well as previous seasons

Kevin “Freeman” Durant
"Plug in a player who can shoot very similarly to Steph and has for almost as long as him with a much worse supporting cast? Prime Steph has always played with at least 2 All NBA players (and often an all star caliber player off the bench) until now, where has 1 All NBA player and several other good role players (revitalized Wiggins).  Give Dame a bunch of low post split opportunities by rotating around Klay or coming off moving Draymond &amp; Bogut screens and he's putting up stats nearly as good as Steph. Not 2016 regular season Steph, but damn near close considering his stats are comparable and he's been rotting away on the Blazers for years  I'll take it one step further; Dame wins just as many rings as Curry does in his exact situation  Put Dame on the 2015 Warriors (vs 4 straight injured point guards, no Kyrie or Love in the Finals, 2017 Warriors (Kevin Durant on his team vs a historically bad Cavs D) and 2018 Warriors (with KD vs LeBron and Jeff Green as his 2nd best player) and he's very likely winning 3 rings too. I know I'll get downvoted, but it's true."

"There's actually a strong case for him right now playing better than Derrick Rose was playing in his rookie year.  Better advanced stats across the board, more steals, better rebounder, better passer, a VASTLY better 3 point shooter.    I'm actually struggling to find a stat Derrick Rose was way better than LaMelo at.  He's actually having a better **rookie** year than Durant as crazy as that sounds.  And no, I'm not saying he'll be better than Durant, cmon.  The one rookie whom I'm pretty sure had a better rookie year than LaMelo though is Blake Griffin.  [Derrick Rose](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=rosede01&amp;p2yrfrom=2009)   [Kevin Durant](https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=ballla01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;p2yrfrom=2008&amp;player_id3=griffbl01&amp;p3yrfrom=2011)"
I got two words for you: Kevin Durant. Draymond Green. Must see TV.
Give me 2019 Kevin Durant
fuck the warriors. fuck the warriors. fuck kevin durant. they made the league boring for 3 years cuz no one could possibly beat them. shit is not fun for any team’s fan other than the warriors. fuck the warriors and fuck steph curry
Kevin Durant is a 7 foot Kemba walker
Giannis without finishing is Kevin Durant
"Kevin of Durant, the freed."
LaMelo currently has the 4th best BPM ever for a teenager.

"The real super star of the warriors, forget that Steph Curry scrub, forget Kevin ""the Snake"" Durant, forget Draymond ""Triple Single"" Green forget Klay ""Icy Hot"" Thompson"
That Kevin Durant guy can get pretty damn unstoppable too
"""Well hello there, welcome to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada! We are here with Kevin...""  ""Durant.""  ""Kevin Durant! And to start here Mr. Kevin Durant in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, I have this record for you! We know how you love your records... if you could just take a look- ""  ""Oh wow. Heh, yeah. This that Superfly! Curtis Mayfield, damn. I used to had this shit on th-""  ""Tell them where you remember this record from Kevin.""  ""Um, yeah it's like I was saying, my mom used to tell me about this one Curtis show she saw when she was younger, and this was like the only record we had in the house for like the longest, man.""  ""Hmmmmm. That's not right. You see I distinctly remember that there was a slightly different story going on. From what I heard. Do you remember the Roc-a-Fella studio sessions where you first met Jay? And this record was playing in the hallway you were waiting in? Why don't you go ahead and tell everyone about Jay, and that session.""  ""There's really nothing to shar-""  ""And why don't you tell the fans about what you did for Jay under that mixing board on that rainy night in Newark. Tell 'em Mr. Kevin.""  ""What do you want.""  ""I want you to do exactly to me what you did for Hov. Nothing held back. You will slobber, and suck, and you will put your fist in my like a civil rights sign- is that understood Mr. Durant, here in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada?""  Kevin sunk to his knees to do what had to be done.  ""Doot doola doot doo..."" Nardwuar snarled.  ""Doot. Doot."" Replied KD through tears."
"[Shams] He's heading back inside now, thinking everything is safe, but Kevin Durant is wrong. He is very, very wrong."
[Shams]: Kevin Durant is taking a huge dump right now  KD: wtf??   [Shams]: Now he’s pulled out his phone and is looking around
You are Kevin Durant. We HAVE to know!
"They’re one of my secondary teams to root for, worth getting familiar with. They have mini-Shaq and Diet Kevin Durant."
"Let me put it this way, if the Kings have 40m in hardcap space between Fox and Barnes’ salaries, do they save money by skimping on pay Fox his max? No the Kings will pay that either way - they aren’t going to *not* pay their franchise player, and even if they did another team gladly would.  Barnes would just get offered 12m instead (the rest) of 20m.  Teams would just skimp on mid-tier priced role players than not pay stars imo.  I don’t think Joe Harris gets 18m for example, I think the Nets would rather sacrifice him than Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is number one?  &amp;#x200B;  Huh?
That and closing the gap between his %s on shots outside the paint from the left side of the court vs the right side. His whole career he’s near Kevin Durant level on the left and near Andrew Wiggins level on the right i haven’t seen a split quite like it over a large sample size. Some team is going to game plan against that in a playoff series at some point if it keeps up
"Tl;DR: The answer is yes, depending on the size/pedigree of your football club  Take a club like Ajax for example. They had a team full of world beaters that happened to run up against thr least sp*rsy sp*rs team in almost a century. A year later, half the team is gone and they finish 3rd in their group. So unless you’re a club like Real Madrid, your window is really only one or two years because of players constantly transferring   On the flip side, if you ARE Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, barca etc, you can retain the players, consistently make deep runs with enough depth to continue to challenge for domestic trophies, and can lure star players away from other clubs with the prospect of playing for the ultimate prize in club football  Compare that with a team like the warriors, who for the vast majority of my 3 decades on this Earth have been absolute shite. They get some good draftees, pair them with the right coach, become obscenely lucky with their timing and the new CBA to add Kevin Durant, and they enjoyed a dynasty"
"I mean dude, there’s no need to be dense. They won 73 games, came very close to repeating as champions, then added Kevin Durant.    It’s clear why they didn’t get MVP hype. The team was just too good.   Plus there wasn’t even a consensus on who was better: Kd or Curry."
"&gt;I mean, yeah, I've said that repeatedly Wiggins is shittier Harrison Barnes. I wouldn't have said that Barnes was some essential part of the Warriors plans going forward in 2015.   He literally was, the only reason we gave him up was because we got Kevin motherfucking Durant lmao"
"It would be funny to see him asking for touches in the post in a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving."
Saying Floyd is the best boxer ever is like saying Kevin Durant is the best basketball player ever
"Oh great... another stat geek who probably hasn’t attended a single econometrics class in his life is citing a bunch catch-all stats without post estimation test results. Cool.  And RAPTOR WAR, seriously? That thing currently has FVV, Jerami Grant, and John Collins to be above Kevin Durant and Giannis btw. A really solid stat from 538.   And fyi, Booker and Lavine are ranked at exactly same spot — 76. So going by RAPTOR WAR, if Zach and Booker were to switch teams, the Suns and the Bulls would still be at the same spot record-wise. So if the currently 15-9 Suns has Zach instead of Booker, would that make Zach an all star?"
Where have I seen this ? Oh yeah Kevin Durant
"Yup was hoping the Knicks at that point were gonna take Mikal Bridges or Porter Jr. but oh well...I knew Knox was a scrub from watching him on Kentucky, I knew his game wouldn’t translate, his skill is absent and he was just drafted purely on potential due to his Kevin Durant like frame."
Would I rather have a guy who has a Kevin Durant like scoring arsenal and efficiency or the guy whose peak is Marcus Smart at best?    Hmm...
"Nobody is coming at me other than delusional Raptor fans who refuse to look at what I’m asking them to look at. Let me guess. You think VanVleet belongs near the top of the list? No, clearly you are the rational human being. VanVleet is clearly better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Wilt Chamberlain. Clearly you are the rational human being here."
"He said Igoudala, who by no means is a bad player but is only a 1 time all star and career 33% 3 shooter, should be the one to take an OPEN shot over the two greatest shooters of all time, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, and one of the greatest scorers of all time Kevin Durant. It was a shit take."
"Surely, a team involving Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden don't *need* Joe Harris to win. If that's the case, then they're not winning it."
"Well betting $5 aint much of a risk, lol.  In all seriousness, I wouldn't take that bet.  During the 'Process 76ers'.  I wouldn't have taken them over UK team that had 11 NBA players in 1998.  Or even the AD, MKG, and company UK Team. Or even that 2001 Duke team with J. Will, Dunleavy, Boozer, and Battier.  We can say with a high degree of confidence that your typical top-end Euroleague player is middling NBA player at best.  Luke, Gasol, are the exception not the rule.  Juan Carlos Navarro, Jasikevivus, Darius Songolia, etc, are more typical of top Euro-League Talent.  Its not like Euroleague is producing 1 All-NBA Talent every year. Its just not that.  If you have a situation of a top-end NBA player on a NCAA roster plus 2 NBA rotational players I wouldn't bet against them against a typical top-Euroleague Team.  When you start talking top-end talent in basketball it matters.  In HS we had 2 future NBA players on our team.  We would play scrimmages versus Mid-Major colleges think, MAC, Horizon League Level Teams. We would beat them. Mind you the other 10 of us couldn't even play at that level.  But when you start talking top-end talent.  It goes a LONG way in basketball.  Look no further than 2010 World Championships of Basketball.  It was a B/C Team but the USA had Kevin Durant.  The best player by far in the tournament. Team USA could win games just because they had a single talent no other team in the world could match."
Maybe because he hasn't been playing? Or when superstars come together their Stats decrease cuz they have to share the ball with each other..  Steph: 29/5/5 on 48/42/92 with 65TS%  Kevin Durant: 29/7/5 on 52/44/87 with 66TS%  Looks like KD is still the one putting up better stats or they pretty much even
"It’s easy,         Step 1. Tank         Step 2. Draft Kevin Durant.         Step 3. ????????        Step 4. Cease to exist, fade to eternal darkness and embrace despair.         Step 5. Success."
"I’m a grammar nut and I don’t see anything wrong with it.  I’d personally change it to say for Nets forward Kevin Durant before his first game against them   But that’s just me, it works either way"
"This is the way I see it.  When all 3 are on the floor, Harden is the primary offensive option, the game runs thru him. Kevin Durant is the first scoring option, Kyrie is the second scoring option. This team is honestly more complex then who’s the 3rd option and who’s not and I think it’s disrespectful to all 3 to try to put them in that position. Kyrie is averaging 28 ppg and is on pace of getting into the very prestigious 50/40/90 club, so I definitely agree with you."
"Collin Sexton, Nets pick, dad dicks Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving into oblivion and then does it again a day later for fun"
"LeBron James + Steph Curry + Kevin Durant + 10 1sts, 26 2nds and Adam Silver’s nudes."
Kevin Durant and lebron in shambles
"I’ve been on “contact tracing protocol” for 6 meetings already.  Me 11/02/2021, future me might average more protocols than Kevin Durant."
"As much as I love data showing Duncan to be superior, I must say that RPM is highly suspect. For example, it suggests Vince Carter was better than Kevin Durant in 2013. Moreover, Ryan Anderson was above LBJ in 2011."
44% from midrange is elite. Kevin Durant shoots 45% from midrange for his career.
"My favorite clip to demonstrate Steph's gravity is when the defense forgets about Kevin Durant.  It starts with leaving him wide open at the 3pt line for a few seconds, then he goes to the basket and starts calling for the ball.  He catches and goes up for the dunk with no one anywhere near him.  I don't think there is any other player in league history who could make all 5 defenders forget they need to cover one of the best scorers ever."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
I don’t think anyone is going to be surprised if a team with James Harden and Kevin Durant turns out to be good and makes it to the finals
1. LeBron James 2. Tim Duncan 3. Shaquille O’Neal 4. Kobe Byrant 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Dwyane Wade 8. Dirk Nowitzki 9. Kawhi Leonard
Dude this is Kevin Durant one of the best scorers of all time
"lmao FUCK KD but this is adorablelol  &gt;Durant said he started to feel better about his decision during his time with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  “I was worried about how my peers were going to feel about me,” he told Steinberg. “In my profession, that’s the only thing I care about. So when I was talking to Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and they were like, ‘Congrats, man, do your thing,’ and Paul George was like, ‘Congrats, man, I am happy for you,’ and Kevin Love was like, ‘Shoot, do what you gotta do,’ that eased my mind a little bit, because I want that from my peers.”"
kevin durant
His ability to turn on a switch when he plays Kevin durant
It’s pretty wild that the Nets managed to put together a Big Three and have Kevin Durant be the most likeable of the stars.
"Kevin Durant was my favorite player in like 2012. I loved his MVP speech. Bought an okc hat with his name on it, and thought I'd be a fan for life. Then he choked to Golden state and joined them. I'd be a pretty salty gsw warrior fan if I had to follow KD there. Instead it's fuck KD🐍🐍"
"My apologies, I conflated the two situations.  [*The reason for the nearly weeklong quarantine is due to Durant traveling to and from the practice facility with a team employee three separate times on Friday, with neither of them wearing masks. The team employee reportedly tested positive for the virus.*](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-to-quarantine-after-close-contact-tested-positive-for-covid-19-rejoin-nets-friday/)  He wasn't wrong to do what he was told, he was wrong to send that ""Free Me"" text like he wasn't partially responsible for his situation."
&gt;Jesus fans online are annoying nowadays. People have to stop making everything championship or bust.  Do you think having james harden. Kyrie irving. And kevin durant in one team is a factor or is it completely manufactured by annoying fans
"[Yup, it's true](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)  Unsurprisingly he got zero sympathy lmao"
Middleton doesn't deserve it over Grant but coaches are going to reward Milwaukee with at least 2 all stars due to their record.  Also I bet Kevin Durant doesn't even make it cause of his injured ass.
"Because Kevin Durant would HUMILIATE Giannis, over and over again. And when Giannis is taken off of KD after giving up too many buckets it makes him look like a chump. Giannis is explosive going forward but lateral quickness reminds me of James Wiseman. KD just crosses him over with his eyes closed.  Giannis does good on KD when he comes in as a help defender. Yeah his length is nice, but imagine guarding KD on the perimeter, it's not going to be pretty."
"Everyone: ""Can Kevin Durant actually still carry a team as it's best player? Guess this is his chance to prove""  KD: ""You know who I am. I'm Kevin Durant"""
"Disclaimer : I'm a LeBron fan, been watching him his entire career. Wasn't a Heat fan, I was a wherever HE-AT fan. Lakers flair but I rock with KD hence the Nets bandwagon flair....  LeBron has demonstrated repeatedly on social media that he's willing to praise himself directly (""try, just try"") or indirectly with pseudo-intellectual attempts at layered meanings.  This is one of those times.  Health willing, there is no need to ""appreciate while we can"" a player still good for 5 more elite seasons remaining at minimum and 2 borderline all-star years after if he still plays.  LeBron on the other hand has 1, maybe 2 more Finals MVP-level years remaining. Even had to throw the #KD tag in there to make sure looking for Kevin Durant related tweets but don't follow him would see it. It's not like he doesn't have the biggest social media presence in basketball or anything!  A non self-serving tweet would have simply been ""GREATNESS!!"""
"Kevin Durant just posted a whopping 50.4 Game Score (according to basketball-reference.com), just the third highest in NBA playoff history."
"Most comments in this thread are complaining about the Bucks, their coach, Giannis, or expressing frustration which says it all. Nephews don't understand we're witnessing greatness. Lebron/Steph/KD are like Rafa/Nadal/Djokovic we're blessed to witness this.  I don't like Lebron James on the court at all but damn is the Suns Lakers series and Suns Nuggets or even Clippers Jazz night and day in terms of how little I care about the other two series. Any game with Steph, KD, or Lebron playing good minutes and playing to win is must watch basketball.   Kevin Durant is an all time great. I'm still not a fan of Harden or Kyrie but I definitely am pulling for Brooklyn over the Bucks. KD, Kyrie, and Harden OOZE skill and BBIQ. KD takes his physical gifts and matches it with such versatility.  Hope Giannis can develop his post play, play-making, and maybe get a hook or floater, his shooting is just not there and eventually he won't be able to just ram into the opposing defender and dunk it when he ages."
KEVIN DURANT IS A FUCKING LEGEND.
"1) They didn't look to exploit hobbled Harden on the offensive or defensive end. Offensively, they were doubling him at times in the first half (why?), and didn't target his hobbled ass on the defensive end.   2) Brook Lopez's drop coverage got exploited continuously by KD, and then on the offensive end, they only passed it to him in the post ONCE. He literally had Shamet on him at times and they just seemed to ignore him.  3) KD going off which is almost a given, he's Kevin Durant.  4) Giannis, Jrue, Khris all had terrible decision-making/shot selection.  If they had just ONE of these things differently, they would've won. 3 of them were completely in their control, with the exception being KD obv. That's why my original comment said ""they lost because the Bucks were complete doo doo water both offensively and defensively.""   Most of these also falls on coaching, but at the end of the day the fact that they lost is extremely embarrassing, I'm still in shock ngl."
"2017 Warriors are the GOAT NBA team. Kevin Durant is over there, maybe the best 1v1 scorer in NBA history. You stopped him? Okay. There's Steph Curry running around, the best shooter in NBA history, the most dangerous off-ball player in NBA history, and an elite 1v1 creator off the dribble. The two best pure scorers of the 2010s. Pick your poison. You somehow locked them both down? Okay, cool. There's Klay Thompson, the best catch-and-shooter in NBA history, sitting on the elbow, waiting for the pass. And on the other end he's locking you down with Iguodala and Draymond Green, a DPOY/serial 1st-team All-Defense.   Just an absurd, all-time great, totally unfair team."
"Kevin Durant has always been in LeBron’s shadow. Tonight, he looked a hell of a lot like LeBron James at his best."
"Let today serve as a reminder to all the nephews who were shit talking yesterday:   Kevin Durant is very, very good at basketball"
Kevin Durant was taught not to play with his food
As somebody cleverer than me once said:  Kevin Durant is made to get buckets like a great white shark is made to eat.
Kevin Durant is clutch... giannis is not.
&gt;To accomplish something that not even Michael Jordan or LeBron James ever accomplished.   Yeah because he's KEVIN DURANT!
"That's just Kevin Durant. That's what he does. So good he makes that look ordinary, for him at least!"
Not Kevin Durant tonight
Nobody in this god damn planet can guard Kevin Durant.  You just put your hand in front of his face and pray to whatever god you follow that he misses.  I still have ptsd from him cooking Tuck and Ariza in 2018 and then all of our defenders in 2019
"This is definitely the only good game Kevin Durant has ever played, you're right my mistake."
Giannis is an amazing player … he isn’t comparable to Durant. They aren’t close. Kevin is levels better.
Hell I've played quarters against the wall twice and I can already say Fuck Kevin Durant.
"PJs only real job this series is to guard kevin durant and he does it the best out of anyone on the bucks, he should be doing it whenever he's available on the floor  he had to sit with foul trouble after he poked harden in the eyeball"
"Its PJs job to guard kevin durant this series that's all he has to do, he was probably the most important player on the floor for the bucks in game 3 which they won  He does the best job out of anyone on the team of guarding him, putting him on KD at the end of a close game like this is exactly what you should be doing  Maybe giannis should have been guarding KD during the stretch when PJ sat with foul trouble, they put khris on him instead and durant just destroyed him.   but he probably would have destroyed giannis too since he has done that all series"
"And Jeff green and Kevin Durant both had career nights. Both played one of the best playoff games they have ever played in their lengthy career.   Giannis is only 26 lol the bucks will have plenty more chances in the next 3-4 years, even these next 1-2 games lol. This sub is so over dramatic and negative lol"
Kevin Durant was just fire tonight. Arguably one of his best performances.
Giannis is akin to Kevin Garnett with worse shooting skills and better handling. Also no one can guard Kevin Durant when he’s on fire like tonight so it doesn’t matter who’s job it is.
I think we saw a glimpse of an alternate reality where Kevin Durant was born with a Jordan/Kobe type of personality and became a relentless scoring machine.
"How do you chalk this up? Is it the mental gymnastics from these Bucks players or coaching problem?   Giannis late 3, stupid fadeaway, having the ball in his hands less than a min left so he can shoot FTs.   On top of Khris Middleton trying to shoot over a locked-in Kevin Durant. People only see KD's offensive prowess but he was locked in on defense as well.   No ball movement which was their bread and butter.   Brook Lopez and not even playing Bobby Portis which would give them more mobility over Uncle Jeff."
"I know Kevin Durant is good, but he can only bench 180 pounds. /s"
"""Fuck"" - Kevin Wayne Durant, 2021"
I think there’s a subtle difference between comparing the gap between you and a nfl talent like Bowden to that of Giannis and Kevin Durant.
Kevin. Durant.
"Kevin Durant firmly put his hat back in the ring for best current player in the NBA.  Can't take that away from him regardless of the rest of the series.  But I don't get the reaction that seems to say the series is over.  I still think the series is a total coin toss.  If the Bucks win the series, regardless of injuries and criticism, they make the conference finals and have a decent shot at making the NBA finals.  And they ain't firing their head coach, regardless of how bad one thinks he is."
Kevin Durant is better than Lebron James. Simple as that.
I can come up with a list of 5 players not on the first team that could beat the 1st team (with only one player even being on the 2nd or 3rd team):      1- LeBron James    2 - James Harden   3 - Jason Tatum      4 - Kevin Durant   5 - Anthony Davis
[I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.](https://youtu.be/qb_hswYhkdw?t=55)
"okay, but here's the thing: who gives a shit when you've got Kevin Durant"
"Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant"
"If you were watching the game you saw a ton of possessions where Harden just dribbled for 15 secs at the top then they were forced to scramble on a desperation shot or pass.  This just happened to be in a crucial moment and KD knocked it down. Biggest shot of the night.  As a nets fan I was going ""wtf wtf wtf you are kidding? Omg wow Kevin Durant..."""
Bucks look like they could be out coached by a 10 year old in the last minutes.    But Kevin fuckin Durant. Jesus Christ that man can ball
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
"Serious question: how many trips to the Finals has Bud cost us? Also, Kevin Durant is sick..as in watching him do this to my team made me sick"
Kevin Durant didn’t even play 50% of the regular season
"Kevin Durant?   Dude is top 3 in the league for the last decade and had insane games coming back from his injury. Harden may have been the glue, but Durant was popping off."
"Kevin ""These Shoulders Were Built For A Reason"" Durant"
Who knows? Kevin durant for some reason just looks better when theres another superstar on the floor. Regardless if they are playing well. It just worked. Kd went off and it could possibly be because he was comforted knowing james harden was in the trenches going to war with him. Confidence is everything in basketball. And kd found his with james harden on the floor.
"Kevin ""Damian Lillard"" Durant"
I love Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant say his name
Kevin Durant
"Not Wilt, not MJ, not Bron. Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant didn't even make your list.  ho.ly.
IM KEVIN DURANT
"Here’s the thing.   You remember the first guy you ever made in a basketball video game that  just completely broke it? Chances are, you made Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant is too skinny, the SuperSonics shouldn’t waste the #2 pick on him."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant appears to be the best nba player
Forget Kevin Durant I’d just take him being Jeff Green for a second
he thought he was kevin durant for a second.
"Wait wait wait, Kevin Durant didn't make the list???  And wtf is this a legacy award? CP3 was not better statistically than Kyrie this season.  Better leader and more impact, yes, but that doesn't determine all nba  Edit: NVM, I forget KD was injured so long."
Bucks are just that dumb they played drop coverage against Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant did what LeBron couldn’t when AD got hurt. He might be the best player in the league right now.

Kevin Durant fucking durant?
"""Y’all know who I am."" - Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant
I haven't watched a whole lot of Kevin Durant. I now see why people talk about him the way they do.
Wow... Kevin Durant... Respect
"Kevin Durant is not kicking out Kareem, Wilt or Hakeem. Man ya'll really don't watch basketball."
"There aren’t 3 guys that could match Durant’s firepower down the stretch of a close game.   Giannis is a great offensive player, but his defense and versatility are his strengths, not going toe to toe with Kevin Durant. Unreasonable expectation."
DPOY guarding joe Harris in the corner while Kevin Durant setting the arena on fire
KEVIN WAYNE DURANT THE GREATEST NBA PLAYER IN THE WORLDDDDDDDDDD
Agreed.  Antetokounmpo destroys offensive fluidity in half-court scenarios.  If he were guarding Kevin Durant maybe it’d be a different story.
Kevin Wayne Durant.
whether jeff green hit his shots or not is irrelevant to the performances of lebron james and kevin durant
Kevin Durant
Drop coverage against fucking Kevin Durant lmao
"Which means 9 shots that Durant didn't take went to other players who got into rhythm and score better down the road   Efficient = Winning the game   Kevin ""easy money sniper"" Durant"
Kevin Durant went to a special place it was nobody’s fault you can’t stop greats in the zone.
Kevin Durant
"Hear me and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the great Slim Reaper. You may think this is suffering, no. It is salvation. The universal scale tips toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile. For even in death, you have become children of Kevin Durant."
"This team has to have the worst offensive IQ of any team this playoffs. I've never seen a team that plays into what works for 2 quarters and build a big lead just to default to iso the next half. Jrue and Khris were taking the worst isos of all time acting like they were prime Kobe and Tmac. Giannis was playing smart the first half by handing the ball off, setting good screens, and not being baited into taking 3's just to fall back into that and fadeaway jumpers. Almost forgot this man's hands turned to stone when he had an open dunk attempt.   Bud needs to be fired no matter what. I've never seen a coach for a ""contender"" make so few adjustments in a game This man saw KD cooking players one-on-one with Brook playing in the paint and just kept watching it happen like KD was just gonna forget how to play. These boys really had a double digit lead in the first half and got cooked by Jeff Green and Kevin Durant. I'm sick."
"Kevin Durant, proving that Achilles was just a giant bitch"
It's probably the best since Jordan's 54 against the Knicks in 1993.  But this sub will downplay it because it's Kevin Durant
"Samee,this is when I turned on the TV and witnessed a Kevin Durant masterpiece"
Kevin Durant might be good at basketball idk
Anyone who thought Kevin Durant cannot carry a team should not be taken seriously.
Kevin Durant is the best player in the world
"Soo. Steph Curry who couldn't even make it into the playoffs. Lebron James who barely played and is hobbled and Julius Randle who may be good but no love for Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell?  Luka Doncic who can't get out of the first rd?  I whole-heartedly disagree with HALF of this list.  Oh yeah, did I miss Kevin Durant????!!!  Who picks Playoff P over KD?  No Booker?"
I don’t think anyone can beat Kevin Durant in a 7 game series
Kevin durant gets me hard
"I was originally rooting for the Bucks but I found myself rooting for Kevin Durant in the second half. Not because I wanted the Nets to win, but damn was he playing well."
"“I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am“ type game"
Nets are pretenders. Their coach sucks. They're basically KD or bust.  They basically are Kevin Durant and a bunch of guys from the early 2010s
Kevin fucking Durant
"Hes better than giannis, who didnt want any of kd this game. 1st team all nba, Mvp and dpoy didnt want to guard kevin durant. Idk man"
they are waiting for a third miracle to happen like : kevin durant will get injured in game 6
kevin durant is good at basketball i think
So just because only three guys have won championships as a top pick means that it’s pointless to get a top pick? So Indy shouldn’t even try to get a Dwight Howard or a James Harden or a Kevin Durant because they didn’t win a chip with their original team? You didn’t even mention Kyrie Irving btw or how a ton of those top picks have brought their teams to the conference finals or finals… It’s better to be a first round exit every year and take a gamble? You’re mentioning Giannis and Kawhi but it’s just a fact that it’s a lot easier to get star talent in the top ten every year than in the 15-20 range.
"You’re breaking it down game-by-game as if Magic wasn’t way more efficient than the Lakers’ leading scorer except managed to do it on much higher efficiency.  The guy was scoring, rebounding, and playmaking, doing it all. That’s why he won FMVP. He was the most complete player in the series, even if he wasn’t the runaway best player…  The 1982 FMVP was not a joke. 2015 was a joke.   Stephews tryna rewrite history they never even witnessed lmao  There is no world where Steph has more than 1 FMVP. He deserved it in 2015 and was outplayed by Kevin Durant in the other two"
"Go the Warriors sub and look at the post which says “Kevin Durant is your FMVP”  Read some of the comments in this thread.  There’s positivity (which is good), but also a lot of that negativity which is what I’m talking about.  “Not gonna lie, the team was kind of like ‘wtf’? Curry robbed. sucks big time”  ^ This comment was upvoted 111 times. 111 times.   There’s many posts like that. If anyone is interested, I can DM them the links on the Warriors sub. For some reason, the autoMOD removes my comments when I post the link  The point I’m trying to make here is Warriors fans move the goalposts a lot, so the original comment was funny to me"
He's Kevin Durant. Do you expect him to be stopped?
"Well, let’s see. Jeff Green, or Kevin Durant. I’ll take Uncle."
Kevin Durant (multiple teams ) including the Texas longhorns
"James Harden is better now than he was in 2013. Kevin Durant is just as good.  Patty Mills is still great, too."

"&gt;Lol. Impressive. Nephews really out for blood tonight.  Did... Did you unironically call me a nephew for asking a question? Are you 12? That's something a literal child would say.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Yeah - dude didn’t respond but averaging 25 a game Jordan is enough to get an 8 seed if he had another star like Kevin Durant and James Harden. They’ll have each other (granted they stay healthy). This is Lebron and Melo’s 37 season. Which will be Durant’s (Harden will actually be 36)     Did 37 year old Jordan playing in the NBA exist? What about 38 and 39, when he was with the Wizards? Ten seed twice. You're arguing for a player that literally doesn't exist.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And Jordan won a chip at 36 then averaged 22 when he was 38 -40.     Jordan was 34 according to BBRef, turning 35. You made 36 up, which is a complete lie.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;And I never said lead. I said “produce enough”. But you did get me with KG. So I’ll replace that with Wilt and Tim Duncan. Sound good?     You said top stars and produce enough to be 8 seed, implying they're getting the team to the 8th seed, implying they're the leader and best player.   Yeah, Wilt and Duncan are better examples. The dude you were arguing against was still right with the 3 players only tho.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I do appreciate you going through all that work and digging through my post history. See anything else you want to discuss?     Nah.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Side Note: I also said “off the top of my head”. This Warriors fan funny enough decided to leave that out. Also the way the other guy responded didn’t sound at all like this warriors fan made it sound. And finally Warriors fan listed 2 not 3 and put words into the other guys mouth for him.     Why would I have to include you saying off the top of your head? That was in your 2nd reply which I didn't quote.  If you aren't confident in your options, then don't say them lmao. Don't blame me. You listed 6 guys and proceeded to say ""Do you not know the guys I listed?"" after the person challenged you..  &amp;#x200B;  The way he responded didn't sound like how I'm saying?  ""Ok so 3 guys ever. Not looking good for a guy with an achilles surgery under his be  That's what he said. The only time I referenced ""what he said"" is when I said ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but, he seems to be correct?"" which literally has nothing to do with ""What he said."" It's about whether he was right or not.  &amp;#x200B;  Finally, me listing 2 and not 3 doesn't change anything, it's me demonstrating that you're even more wrong than the guy implied. Only 2 of your examples work and the Bucks fan was generous and said 3. Again, doesn't change anything. You could include a 37 year old MJ that doesn't exist or a 37 year old Lebron that doesn't exist and he'd still be right."
"Harrison ""Kevin Durant"" Barnes"
We’re coming for you next Kevin Durant.
I wish Kevin Durant provided the service you do. Just friendly investment advice to NBA fans.
Lol. Impressive. Nephews really out for blood tonight.

This is Lebron and Melo’s 37 season. Which will be Durant’s (Harden will actually be 36)   And Jordan won a chip in at 36 then averaged 25 when he was 38 and-40.   Besides I was talking about Harris’s extension anyway. Which Harden will be 36.   I never said lead. I said “produce enough”. But you did get me with KG. So I’ll replace that with Wilt and Tim Duncan. Sound good bud?   But I appreciate you going through all that work digging through my post history. Anything else you want to discuss?
How did Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant out-rebound Bam Adebayo and Blake Griffin?
Kevin Durant is a scorer even tho they averaged the same amount of points thats not the highlight of LeBron game unlike kd is known as a scorer
Harden really has no excuses. I think he's just out of shape from his injury but he has Kevin Durant. Finals or bust  Is Claxton injured or benched?
It's inspirational to see Kevin Durant left playing with Stephen Curry to try to win a championship on a team with no other allstars.
"People will give Kevin Durant shit for being 240 at 6'10"" or 6'11"" but Bol Bol at 7'2"" 220 needs his minutes."
"Kevin Durant. No this isn’t just a salty Cavs fan talking, people just like parity"
Lebron can get more points but Kevin Durant is very efficient and inefficient shots if that makes sense? His height allows him to hit a ton of contested shots. Lebron has expanded his post game and three point game late in his career but Durant came in a polished scorer. Before Durant missed that season in okc it was widely predicted that he would break the scoring record one day.
"He doesn’t have to wear a mask for nobody to recognize him, he’s not kyrie or Kevin Durant. And I saw Jason something, the guy who did Ted lasso, on the train ride home from a yankee game, nobody gave a shit or didn’t recognize who he was"
"Kevin Durant, idc. tHE HArdEst roAd, honestly I don't care about that either. There is no basketball player I'd rather watch than Kevin Durant."
"The obsession that some people have with Bol Bol is something else. And Bol Bol definitely agrees with them.   Bol was never going to be a good NBA player. All his ""potential"" was completely theoretical and ignoring massive amound of red flags. Yeah he can shoot and dribble pretty well for being that tall but when you have no speed to strength to be able to utilize that and you play like you're Kevin Durant but have the BBIQ of Javale McGee you are not going to be a good player."
"&gt; Do you support Malone’s lineups and decision, specifically regarding Bol?  Definitely.  You need to prove yourself in practice. And when you enter games, you have to play the right way. It still is basketball. Bol Bol? Black hole on offense, black hole on defense. He doesn't try on D, and just shoots everything on offense, every time. If we had a stat about 3rd stringers vs 3rd stringers, we get murdered almost every time. Why? Bol Bol.  As I stated, I don't agree he has played anything close to ""well"" in his opportunities.  &gt; Do you agree that when placed in the starting lineup against KD, he played very well and with energy and focus?   I agree he tried. That is the thing. You don't get to choose when you try. You have to play hard and the right way every single time.   &gt; Would you also acknowledge the fact that a 21 year old son-of-an-NBA-legend would probably have a strong emotional response to G.I. Malone’s military style seniority system while he’s watching guys like Dos Verdes and Austin Rivers make significant negative impacts in positions he can play?  Who cares who's son he is? He has to show _he_ belongs, and that he has the right mindset to be an NBA player. He hasn't shown that. Now, Bol Bol can't even start to thing to play Rivers position. Bol Bol isn't an SG. And Rivers _proved himself in the playoffs_. Remember? We beat Lillard/McCollum. With Rivers.  &gt; You REALLY gonna sit here and suggest that Bol Bol should be eating pine for JaMychal Green or Austin Rivers? Especially when Malone is running a 3-guard lineup with the Geriatric Duo in the front court???  YES! You have to play basketball, a team game. you have to show effort, every single time. YOU ARE NOT A STAR! You don't have _anything_ given to you, never. Bol Bol acts like he is Kevin Durant, and as he doesn't need to do the dirty work. He can rot on the bench with that mindset, he is no good at all to any TEAM with that smug attitude."
"Yeah, I feel like these guys think everyone in New York are like those hardcore psychos from that meme that's been going around recently. Like nah that's like 0.001% of the NY population. An average New Yorker doesn't give a fuck about the Knicks, or basketball other than like Lebron James or Kevin Durant lol"

Jokic   Kevin Garnett  Steph Curry  Durant  Chris Paul
"CP3 was pretty bad. No Ariza or Mbah a Moute (Warriors always had better depth), remember Morey had to trade a pick so they could get rid of James Ennis so they wouldn't be BARELY over the tax. Harden didn't hit his normal free throws in game 6. And the Warriors still had Kevin Durant for 4.5 games."
"Could totally be wrong, but shouldn’t they try to develop him as a Kevin Durant lite opposed to a typical stretch big?"
Kevin Durant has pretty much always played with another all nba level player
"That's cool and all but for Kevin Durant specifically, probably not relevant"
In this post: some mf who lives under a rock that never heard of Kevin Durant. Lol   (Speaking of which I don’t think any Nets  got mentioned at all)
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James.
"Yep, and meanwhile he's not nearly as injury prone as a bunch of other superstars are. Look at the number of missed regular season games over the last 5 seasons before this one:  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old  Why is AD the one who's considered the most injury prone?"
Kevin Durant didn’t deserved the hate when he went to GS. He gave OKC everything he had and they decided to back Westbrook as the number one guy.
"Kevin Durant joined the Warriors not just because he wanted to beat LeBron, but because Steph was a serious threat to his status even as the 2nd best player in the league, let alone LeBron as #1. He knew Steph would defer and he needed to be seen as the top dog on the Warriors, lest he be seen as the third best player in the league. After a few years of Steph deferring, his mission was accomplished and he moved on, having secured the perception he was better than Curry, even though Curry readily accepted being the #2 option to placate KD and his fragile ego."
Steph Curry is undoubtedly better than Kevin Durant
"LeBron and Steph are already there, but I don't think Kevin Durant will get there tbh"
Russell Westbrook is the Best PG since Magic Johnson.  Jaylen Brown has more potential than Jayson Tatum.  Kevin Durant is the GOAT 2nd fiddle.   Porzingis is the most predictable player in the NBA. Second is Carmelo  Giannis is more dominant than SHAQ
"yeah but he's so good that's almost a disservice!  lavine is in that weird niche of players where, if he's your #1 everything on offense, you're fucked. but if you already have a great #1 ball-handler, playmaker, scorer, and you add lavine, you're a legit title contender. he's closer to klay thompson than kevin durant, in that regard."
Kevin Durant is the perfect #2 offensive player in the league ;)
Bubble AD was Kevin durant with Dwight defence lol
"If Westbrook can't even win a single ring after a career of playing with James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James and Anthony Davis there is no way he escapes the failure label."
Kevin Durant will never be the best player in the NBA because he cannot playmake like the other top 5 players can
Kevin Durant
You do understand it isn’t that hard to look this shit up lmao. Trae and donovan didnt get the full supermax because they haven’t gotten all nba nods. Luka has.  Kevin durant aint got a supermax cause he didn’t play for the warriors/nets long enough out of free agency. Ditto for pg and jimmy. Not sure about davis but I’d imagine its something similar. The supermax was brought in to incentivise small market players to stay with their teams.
"Yeah, that Cavs team was historic offensively. . Problem was, you guys essentially traded Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant and kept everyone else. We had no shot."
Kevin Durant is also 11 inches taller than him.
"Kevin ""Dexter"" Durant"
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
We will never know how good Kevin Durant really is.
Trae young got the same contract as Luka.   So...suggests he is also a supermax rookie extension player.  And what about Donovan Mitchell's 5 195 rookie max?  What about Paul George? Kevin Durant?  Anthony Davis? Jimmy Butler?
"Steph curry&gt;Kevin Durant as a player and from a legacy stand point. He won a ring as the only real star on his team, he won two mvps, and he broke the single season wins record. I think people rate Durant on what he was supposed to be a decade ago. When he was 22, went to the finals and win an mvp. Since then he’s never won a ring as the man, he’s never won another mvp, and he is still falling short in the playoffs. Unless Durant manages to win a title this year with kyrie our or win another mvp I really don’t see him as even a top 15 player of all time. Hell even giannis has surpassed him at this point     Steve Nash should have never won an mvp. Every year he won there were guys with far more impressive seasons and stats. Namely Kobe in 06 dragging one of the worst rosters ever assembled to the playoffs while scoring 30+ points a game.    I have a second one for Steve Nash as well. I don’t think he would really improve that much in the modern era like people claim. Nash was never that skilled or gifted as a scoring threat or shot creator. He was one of the best shooters ever but it was on low volume. He paved the way for guys like harden and curry, but their skills far exceed anything he could do. I don’t think giving Nash more shots would have made him a 30ppg scoring threat and he’s even said it himself he was running at 100% during those suns years and he never had an extra gear to tap into. He was already at his absolute best and there was no improvement he could realistically have."
Kevin Durant? He plays basketball? I only knew him from the deodorant commercials.
It's not the Warriors fault. They did the correct thing.   In my original comment I specifically stated it was Kevin Durant who didn't.
Kevin Durant boarding a plane to Tokyo rn
Kevin Durant ruined what could've been the greatest NBA rivalry of the past 20 years
KD would rather the first like of his Wikipedia be “Kevin Durant is an American hooper” than ever win another ring
Can Kevin Durant stop with this “hOoPeR” shit

"&gt;SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)  I'd suggest Luka and Wiggins. Opposite in personalities, one is a dominant playmaker and scorer whereas the other is a great defender and solid scorer. Luka wayyy more on ball whereas Wiggins is more offball.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)     I have a better one:  KP vs Draymond:  KP is a giant PF/C that misuses his height by being a sharpshooter from deep despite his height. Dray is a relatively small PF/C that is a historically elite defender despite his height. Dray is mobile as hell and an iron man whereas KP is stiff and injury prone. Also opposite in personalities as well as being opposite in games."
"he can still average 40 if he wants to, but now he has kevin durant on his team so he can chill"
What does that have to do with why Kevin Durant isn’t being talked about?
Kevin Durant going off rn
OK so they are stacked.... because of Kevin Durant  And his play should be discredited because he's too good or something?
Since when was CP3 ever in the same realm as Kevin Durant??  What “normal” contender has 2 MVP level players on it?  You mean normal superteam lol
"Can find mention of Adrian Dantley in this thread. 24.3 pts per game, true shooting percentage higher than Kevin Durant. (and this was back when the league TS% was 5 points lower than it is now)"

Kevin Durant
"If anything Kevin Durant going to the Warriors harmed Steph Curry's legacy. They won the title before Durant got there, but once there Durant got the Finals MVP and most of the credit."
Wouldn't Jalen Green have to be Kevin Durant in order to break Kevin Durant's career high for threes?
"Thank you Charles!  Allow me to quote me over the past several years, and I get downvoted for saying it but it’s true: unrestrained free agency is destroying sports. You can’t buy a jersey, you have no idea where that player on the jersey is going to be 15 minutes from now, much less an entire season. Stacking teams is bad, letting Lebron leave Cleveland where he’s a hometown hero is bad, and watching Kevin Durant give a huge middle finger to the good people of Oklahoma City was bad.   Please, please, please… as a fan, demand better."
"Melo was better in every way. His consistency and longevity was a huge key. Paul George is amazing DONT get me wrong. But Melo was heavily snubbed from a bunch of all nba back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. (2006,2009,2011, 2014) these four all nba selection should have been given to him. 2014 and 2009 one should had been automatic but for whatever reason boozer got it over him in 2009 and Kevin love in 2014.  Also don’t forget the forward selection from the 2000s was heavily dominated by Garnett dirk duncan lebron. There was no way PG would get first place over them. Melos 2013 all nba selection was also the hardest to get first place. Durant managed to edge Melo out with 50/40/90 and Lebron was just at his absolute best. Had the knicks management with Phil Jackson been competent the Knicks would had been a consistent playoff team. No reason to blow up a team that was second seed in 2013."
There’s a reason why the average Thunder fan’s opinion of Paul George is much higher than Kevin Durant despite the discrepancy of their careers in OKC.
Kevin Durant. The legacy killer. All you gotta do is play with him and your legacy drops like a fucking stone lmao.
Kevin Durant led league in scoring multiple times  End of discussion
"What is he gonna do? What is he gonna do that he wasn't able to do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal?   He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's gonna win games for sure but how much will it matter in the playoffs when this is the same Lakers team that sagged off of him during the Bubble Run.  The only way I see him get busy is when you make him the 6th man and he plays with Monk, Melo, Dwight and Ariza while AD and LeBron are on the bench. Even then his shooting inability is a detriment to winning basketball. Even then, I don't think that's possible coz why you paying this dude who never learns $40M as the 6th man."
My lineup of these players would be this:  PG: Ben Simmons and Steph Curry(pretty obvious)  SG: James Harden and Jrue Holiday(Again pretty obvious)  SF: LeBron James and Kevin Durant(maybe the most and least ball dominant superstars)   PF: Kristaps Porzingis and Zion(Guy who is 7 foot but only takes jumpers vs. guy who isn't but scores everything at the rim)  C: Jokic and Embiid(Great playmaker meh defender vs. great defender meh playmaker)

"I can't believe we lost to this ""Kevin Durant"" scrub"
Miles bridges &gt; Kevin Durant
Kevin “despite the loss” Durant
It’s entertainment tbh. I like watching the people who called Harden better than Kevin Durant last year suddenly lash out and call him washed over 3 games
"Green interviewing Durant a few months back is a good watch. They end up sort of jointly claiming it was the way Kerr and Warriors management approached their argument that played a big part in Durant bailing. I think it sounds fishy to me, and more like ""we're going to blame these people instead of, maybe, ourselves for how things went down.""  [https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/18/kurtenbach-draymond-green-kevin-durant-couldnt-help-but-tell-the-truth-about-the-warriors-breakup/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/18/kurtenbach-draymond-green-kevin-durant-couldnt-help-but-tell-the-truth-about-the-warriors-breakup/)  TBH I feel like KD was looking for some kind of cred in his career that going to GS, and winning titles there, didn't provide, and he may have actually thought it hurt him cause he was teaming up w/ proven, extant stars. Still dogged internally from not getting it done with OKC, for some reason. He was such an incredible fit with not only the Warriors' players but their system that I will never truly understand why he bailed."
"Kevin Durant on Kyrie Irving: ""We support his decision"""
&gt;  since joining Brooklyn  Kevin Durant his last year in Golden State: 5.9 APG.    Kevin Durant his first year in Brooklyn: 5.6 APG.
What buttons do I have to press to unlock Kevin Durant for the hornets?
Kevin Durant. First time I saw him play live (OKC) it was like watching ballet. Dude is graceful in a way that that all other incredible athletes in the NBA can’t be.
Kevin Durant is so good at putting that basketball inside the hoop.
Kevin Durant &gt; Lamelo Ball
My list:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  5. Nikola Jokic
Lol I got all excited to read a Booker post because he's really having an incredible Finals showing for his first run at it at age 24 but the top comment is about Giannis lol    Insane that he's right behind a name like Kevin Durant though. Shame he had that 3/14 game right in the middle of this series
"And the nets with Kyrie, kevin Durant, and harden aren't?  Is LeBron retiring next year and I didn't know about it? Is AD leaving?"
01 LeBron James.   02 Kevin Durant.   03 Giannis   04 Jokic  05 Stephen Curry.   06 James Harden.   07 Kawhi Leonard.   08 Anthony Davis.   09 Luka Doncic.   10 Embiid  are your superstars in the league (honorable mention Dame)
"As a bucks fan injuries largely benefited them on their road to the playoffs but they also suffered their own.  They lost a key starter in round 1 then nearly lost giannis for a very very long time.  Also the butterfly affect is real. Generally speaking...the nets are going to be better with kyrie or harden at full strength. That being said...what if Kevin Durant had 5-10 less shots in his takeover games...that harden or kyrie missed or didn't capitalize on?   Now I'm not saying Brooklyn is better without those 2 cause tneu certainly aren't...but in a short sample size...kd played out of his mind and they would have needed harden and kyrie to play that insane to ""equalize"" thr production kd did as the primary handler and scorer."
And the bucks were one Kevin Durant shoe size away from being eliminated.
Kevin Durant - it’s impossible what a stick figure can do what he does
"Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant"
"that trade would be the dumbest thing Portland ever did, and they took Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan AND Greg Oden over Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant was the difference between the Warriors losing in 7 and winning in 5 against the Cavs. If Murray goes 2020 playoffs nuclear maybe the Nuggets steal a couple of games
1. Kevin Durant 2. Steph Curry 3. Giannis Atetekumpo  4. Nikola Jokic 5. Joel Embiid 6. Luka Doncic 7. LeBron James 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. James Harden 10. Anthony Davis
only high iq humans are fans of kevin durant
If you want to get into fights on this sub constantly: Kevin Durant  If you want to never get into fights on this sub: Steph Curry
Bucks were a size 18 shoe away from being sent home by Kevin Durant and scrubs
"Cool to brag about acting in bad faith lol?   It’s really not that hard   2009:  LBJ, Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant you could make arguments for more people also Kobe was 31 and his numbers were dipping and his defense was getting a lot worse   2010:   LBJ, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, and again Dwight Howard   I’m not even sure this is a discussion unless your argument is Kobe is better because he was popular? He was contributing less than these guys that’s nothing to be ashamed of he was top 5 both years, but not top 3, which is a criteria you created"
"That doesn't make a lick of sense.   &gt; If FMVP was what you said it’d go to the best player in the league since he’s on the best team and won the award. That very rarely happens.  I never said this. You get 7 games or so against the best competition on the biggest stage to prove you're the best. Each game matters, each possession matters. Westbrook aiming for the 5th seed really didn't matter yet he won MVP.  You bring up Iggy but that's an anomaly. Let's look at others  Lebron (best in the league)  Kawhi (top 3 player in the league)  Kevin Durant (top 3 player in the league)  Durant  Lebron  Iggy   Kawhi  Lebron  Lebron    8 out of the last 9 years it has gone to a top 3 player in basketball."
"Kevin Durant, greatest shooter of all time but still gets disrespected by this sub."
"they been around for just over a decade. missed the playoffs like 3 times?  been to a finals, been to 4 WCFs, were a serious contender for half the decade. Had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and more play for them. Now they have promising young talent in Shai and a huge number of assets to work with. yeah they never won, but compared to other newer teams they’ve been spoiled."
Kevin Durant
Necessity is different than luxury. To beat the Cavaliers of Warriors didn't need Kevin Durant with their existing roster (they were injured and lost by one minute in G7). But Durant was a luxury and they changed their roster to get him and then he was a necessity to win.   You make it seem like LeBron and the Cavs like he had no help whatsoever. Kyrie Irving Kevin Love LeBron James. All amazing shot creators and their Prime.  You're mixing narratives for the Warriors and KD
Kevin Durant and many other celebrities would disagree with you...
No shit Doncic &gt; Ayton  Blazers would have been better if they drafted Michael Jordan instead of Sam Bowie or Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden imo
"Kevin Durant hasn’t made first team in four seasons, he’s the best non top 5 player ever."
Warriors have the greatest regular season all time and then add Kevin Durant. I guess that’s what it took to beat LeBron so maybe it is fair
"Bruh KD is better than Giannis. You can argue for Giannis 2-5, but THIS SEASON, Kevin Durant (y'all know who he is), was the best player on the planet. LeBron needs to reclaim his throne (which he's done multiple times, but he has to prove it yet again)."
"It is wild that KEvin Durant is considered one of the best scorers ever  Yet him and Lebron both have identical career PPG right now (27)  I am not saying you are wrong, it is just wild that Lebron's scoring ability of all things gets overlooked"
Giannis/Middleton.. good lord.... We've created Kevin Durant.
"&gt;The very first mention of Giannis on March 26th, four months before he would get drafted: ""I don't care who we draft in the first, I just want Giannis in the second. Kevin durant 2.0.""  Well he could hardly be more different than KD"
"Presti is a good GM, and has recently put the Thunder in a great spot asset wise for the future ... and he's made some good trades with Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Paul George, etc....  But goddamn, he could have had Durant, Westbrook and Harden in their primes on the same team had he just given Harden the contract he wanted.....  Instead he traded Harden, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two 1sts and one 2nd.   Oh and then KD left 4 years later.  ...... man, imagine if that core had stayed ...... the Warriors dynasty maybe wouldn't have even gotten 1 ring in the 2010s."
"Well honestly Kawhi will never be Durant, which is why it's insane tho think someone could become a Kevin Durant.  I suppose becoming a Kawhi is basically the ceiling at this point. Like, if you train your fucking ass off to become a shooter, you could get to Kawhi's level (still optimistic).  But KD? That was a silly take. Although I doubt anyone saw him becoming Lanky Shaq either. He was so hard to read, it's not surprising only a couple people on here were die hard homers."
"I think he got a bit unlucky to go against the Nets/Durant.  People were slamming him for not adjusting to Kevin Durant and acting like it was an easy adjustment to make. Absolutely no offense to y'all, but a healthy Nets team likely wins easily this year and I think even with just a healthy Kyrie that would have been outcome and that's just because there's no real adjustments to KD and Kyrie.  The adjustments people were offering ""stop drop coverage""(against the Hawks they simply adjusted their drop coverage against Trae and it worked wonders by sending Giannis to help earlier to prevent the possible lob and still being able to stop Trae as he drives in), ""bench Lopez""(he did in one game and it cost them offensive rebound after offensive rebound), ""double KD""(he did when there was no Harden and Kyrie, but doing it with Harden on the court would have been a mistake, injured or not), all weren't really that viable."
&gt;Kevin Durant 2.0  I wonder if there is an alternate universe where Giannis never puts on the muscle but instead has a better shooting coach to refine his shooting
"Yes, Kevin Durant (who was shown to have an incredible basketball IQ multiple times) thinks like a random redditor that seems the game as only 1 on 1. I guess you probably talked to him in DMs to know that's how he thinks right?  Jesus Christ, the level that this sub goes to sometimes is insane."
"They needed KD, stop fooling yourself. The 2017 Warriors also didn't only switch Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant, they also lost a lot of the depth that made them win 73 games in 2016 to begin with (Speights, Bogut, Barbosa, etc.). The Warriors went from one of the best second units in the league to one of the worst, so no, the didn't ""just traded Harrison Barnes for KD"".  The Warriors got exposed in those playoffs. They survived OKC because Russell Westbrook can sometimes be the actual worst and then got hammered three straight games by a team that had more talent in the top than them, they wouldn't have beaten the 2017 Cavs (a much better version of the team that actually won)."
Kevin Durant Game 6 ECF of this year? Whatever game he went absolutely crazy and dropped 49.
Kevin Durant trying daily to use Twitter?? to untarnish his name and legacy
Kevin durant went from scoring 66'6% in regular season to 59% vs bucks (ts% which includes free throws)  Nets as a whole went from 61% true shooting in regular season to 56% true shooting in playoffs (slightly below league average )  helped by injuries but still accomplished the job of showing dowm the nets offense  it was the other side of the court thst was a problem
"Name nba players that has no flaws. How many there are? like 3? Kevin Durant (but he has some injury concerns so maybe doesnt fit here?), Lebron James (but he is at the end of his career so maybe doesnt fit either), Luka Doncic (below average 3pts/ft shooter, lots of To...so maybe bot him either?).  You are massively underrating Sabonis. He can defend. Defence isnt only blocked shots. Its steals too (Sabonis had 1.1 per game), its deflections (was high on the list), rebounds (one of the best in the business), he was like leading nba in distance covered on defence meaning he is putting effort there.  Even advanced stats that kinda did nt like Sabonis last year - werent bad whatsoever for his defence (they suffered on offense mostly).  Also he just turned 25, is on great contract and keeps improving massively every year."
"Yes, because the NBA went through and required each player to be measured and listed at their actual height.  He measured at 6’9 [here’s an article ](https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard)"
"Kevin Durant had no business speaking on these matters after what he did to the people of Oklahoma City. Sit down and listen, Kevin. There is a thing called a “team” and there is a thing called “loyalty.”"
His bacon game is strong: 3 degrees of Kevin Durant.
Its great to see how truly delusional kevin durant really is. Probably has been living in a bubble that only includes his yes men for the pst decade.
"I think the majority of people believe that the teams were fairly even but Durant tipped the scale and ruined everything. Of course there are people who believe the Cavaliers were superior but that’s probably because the breaks that the Warriors had in 2015 far outweigh what the Cavaliers had in 2016. The Cavs still managed to win two games in 2015 with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving being injured which is very impressive.  Being said, I believe the rivalry was amazing to watch until Durant came and made it so one sided that the 2017 and 2018 Finals weren’t even worth watching."
"it's funny because among the reasons why KD decided to go to golden state is that the team was going to be clearly better than any other (and they basically were alredy better than any other with harrison barnes playing SF).  So yes, KD is trying his best to validate those 2 rings he got without much issues because let's not forget he was playing with a team that ended up winning a little more than 70% of the games played when KD was out for injury or rest.  In 2017 Warriors vs Cavs rematch without KD would've had still be a close series. Imagine thinking it was even exchanging Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. Yeah, Kevin is delusional about this topic and it's not the first time he proves it."
"&gt; These teams should be lauded for creating the structure to capitalize on it  This is exactly right imo. If you are not a traditional power and/or a desirable market, then you simply cannot expect to have a team full of in-their-prime superstars. That simply doesn't happen for 24-25 teams in the league.  What a ""small"" market team (any team not in the list of 5-6 that can count on a regular influx of superstar talent) *can* do, on the other hand, at least in this era of collaborative superstardom, is commit to being very good for a long enough time that eventually things break right and you can steal one.  That's how Dirk's Mavs did it; that's how the Raptors did it. Those teams hung tough every year, making deep playoff runs, developing world-class chemistry, and ignoring the noise about how they were ""oN a tReAdMiLl"" and would never, indeed *could* never, break through.  Ironically enough, that's exactly how great teams had tended to be built for decades before MJ broke everyone's brains: the GP-Kemp Sonics, the Stockton-Malone Jazz, even the Hakeem-centric Rockets: those teams all lurked around the fringes of contention for an extended period of time. It just so happened that when MJ was healthy, he snuffed them all out. That, combined with Shaq's relatively shocking move to LA and the fluke Spurs season that gave them Tim Duncan, put everyone in the NBA into dynasty-building mode and licensed multi-year tank jobs in the eyes of the public. Front offices could ask their fans: ""How can you expect us to beat the Duncan Spurs or the Kobe-Shaq Lakers without multiple superstars of our own? We *need* to be bad for many years to accumulate the necessary assets, which we will then magically develop into contenders down the line . . . Do not ask us how our young guys will suddenly understand how to win and please do not ask us about why we aren't winning and signing good veteran players in the meantime, either!""  Never mind that there was plenty of evidence that this approach to team-building was cynical at best and a complete farce at worst--evidence in the form of the '04 Pistons, or those tough mid-aughts Pacers teams, or the CWebb Kings, or even the Shaq-Wade Heat--it was easy to sell long-suffering fans in non NY or LA markets on the prospect that a dynasty was always around the corner, on the other end of the tanking rainbow.  Combine that with a wised-up Obama-era basketball fandom that had newly welcomed in thousands of professional-managerial class career strivers from homes in the suburbs, a group of (overwhelmingly) white men who had been trained since childhood to conflate efficiency with absolute moral good and uncritically to accept unlimited asset accumulation as the way of the successful, and you had the perfect storm. This group had cut their fandom teeth on immersive video games that offered the opportunity for bored kids to play God with roster construction and rewarded them for signing players at below-market rates on long-term contracts, exchanging expensive veterans for cheap kids, and accumulating draft picks like free lottery tickets. They could play the games and the Game beyond the game; could be the superstar and the manager in the C-suite that their parents and teachers had prepared them to become.   Of course, a video game can't simulate the toxic effects of perpetual losing and of a lack of locker-room leadership; it can't foresee Kevin Durant and James Harden leaving OKC for their own autonomous reasons any more than it can predict that creating a culture of unlimited entitlement for blue-chip prospects will produce a ""star"" player as fundamentally broken as Ben Simmons.  If the Bucks pull this off, then I'll be all the more delighted that they did so despite their own botched tank job, which produced lottery picks like Brandon Jennings and Joe Alexander and Jabari Parker and ""major"" free-agent signings like Greg Monroe. Despite themselves, the Bucks have built a contender the old-fashioned way: through chemistry and determination, through a culture of winning forged out of years of steady, unheralded improvement, and, most of all, through a heaping portion of luck. Luck gets sneered at around here, and in most of the other self-satisfied neoliberal hell-holes that constitute the majority of social media in this country, but no portion of luck can make a bad team NBA champions. It can make a *good* team into champions, and I think that ought to be enough. Imagine if we had thirty teams trying desperately to be good every year, and holding out hope that, one bright day, everything would break right and their steadfast determination to improve and persevere would finally pay off. I think it'd make for a much better league."
"""Don't ever compare him to me""  \- Kevin Durant to ESPN (maybe)"
“Kyle Korver is the second greatest shooter of all time behind Reggie Miller.” —Kevin Durant
Im a Kevin Durant fan but even i will acknowledge that 2017 Warriors team was not equal.
"Prime Jordan was athletically gifted and had bigger hands than Kawhi. In his time the 3 ball wasn’t prioritized. I’m sure if Jordan played in today’s era with its training and facilities and his work ethic he’d be a solid 3 point shooter. He doesn’t need it though, given how efficient he was in the paint and midrange. He was a shorter Kevin Durant with just more skill"
"2011 Mavs beat Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Dwade, and bosh. Giannis beat a nets team without Kyrie, a crippled harden, trae young, and Chris Paul/Devin Booker they can’t be compared"
Kevin muh fucking Durant
"I'm so fucking sick of Kevin Durant. On the court, killer. Of the court, just fucking unbearable."
But who cares about kevin love’s experience? Durant and Dray have been on the olympic team before. Why will love’s experience add anything of value when the team has that already? How about we put players on the team based on their play.
Has team USA forgotten Kevin Durant is on their side
Here's the thing: the 2017 Cavs were better than the NBA champion 2016 version. That's how far the Kevin Durant addition separated these relatively competitive teams. Turned a competitive 7-game series into what was more or less a sweep.
Kevin “The Gaslighter” Durant
kevin durant is such a troll lol I love it
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
Look I’m by no means a lebronstan but he played for a shit Cleveland team (where he had little to no input) for years before he joined Miami to win. Kevin Durant did the same thing with OKC before coming to the warriors and breaking the league. Lebron then went back to Cleveland and delivered a championship which like it or not is respectable. Then he went to LA who at the time only had Magic Johnson to offer. You point is weak g.
Kevin Durant
"“All basketball players are equal, but some are more equal than others.” - Kevin Durant probably"
"It's not even like the 2016 finals were hyped up as some clash of the titans either. The Warriors were heavy favourites going into that series, and most people thought the real finals were the WCF. They were a 73-9 team vs a Cavs team that had chemistry issues and ups and downs all year. The Cavs winning that series was an underdog victory, and then the Warriors who should have already won added Kevin Durant."
So you’re saying that if you were Curry you would tell your team not to sign *Kevin fucking Durant* because you wanted to win the hardest way?
&gt; Giannis being a top 25 player ever because Kevin Durant wore oversized shoes is ~~crazy~~ **idiotic** to think about.  FTFY
"I don’t think he’s referring to the likability of the teams or integrity with which they were built…he’s referring to the fact that in 2016 the Warriors and Cavs were essentially completely even, top to bottom, and then one of them added Kevin Durant, thus making the matchup unbalanced.  Pretty hard to argue against that tbh, Durant is insane if he thinks it was an even matchup"
“Kyle Korver was an all star player.”  — Kevin Durant probably
"The two teams went to the final minute of a Game 7 the previous year, and then one team added Kevin fucking Durant. In what world was that even?"
Kevin Durant without Kyrie and half of harden almost beat Giannis with the bucks being 100% healthy besides donte. He was an inch away from beating Giannis. I don’t care about regular season awards how many times do we have to see that shit doesn’t matter
"I’m going to admit I didn’t like the KD to the Warriors move and I kinda don’t care that much 5 years later but still not a particular fan. At the same time , Kevin really exposed how stupid a lot of fans logic is. So many fans are all about “HOW MANY RINGS THO???”. Kevin Durant was a legend before and after winning those rings in Golden State but now he has 2 rings, albeit in a move most people don’t like, so is he now all of a sudden legitimatized??? And now you still have people who say “But he did it the wrong way tho”. It’s just funny"
I defend hard when I play pickup and I’d def lock your bitch ass up *he says in Kevin Durant voice*
Name something this sub loves more than Klay Thompson.  Note: Shitting on Kevin Durant is excluded from this.
"No, but it definitely is by having Kevin Durant even remotely interact with it, lol.  Also, when people say they don't care in earnest and mean it, do they post on Reddit?  It's okay if you like the nuances of Twitter beef, man.  Most people do."
"I’m not arbitrarily deciding, when the bucks got taken to 7 games vs Kevin Durant and 25% of James harden that’s when I decided.  When the suns lost 2 games to the clippers without 2 starters and kawhi that’s when it because obvious to me. Let’s not act like the bucks weren’t about 1 inch away from getting knocked out in the second round. Not trying to rain on your parade, but be real. The two remaining teams are simply the healthiest."
This is not true at all.  He asked why the former DPOY wasn’t being assigned to guard Kevin Durant.  He wasn’t going after Giannis for his play.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o0v85c/cj_mccollum_bruh_first_team_all_defense_and_aint/
"I remember a couple of years ago he was asked something to the effect of why doesn't he train with players on other teams in the off-season. He said something like why would he train with them when they're his opponents.   &gt;He told The Athletic: ‘I can’t work out with you in the summer and then play you in a few months. It feels weird. It doesn’t feel right with me. Like other players, it’s cool for other players, but I don’t. I don’t want to. Other guys do it. ‘I feel like with LeBron and KD [Kevin Durant], KD did that to LeBron. Take a lot of his thoughts and use it against him. And that’s what I don’t want guys doing to me.’  [Source](https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/25/nba-mvp-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james-kawhi-leonard-summer-training-10055101/)  I think he just has a killer mentality, which I love. But because he doesn't train with them he doesn't build the same relationships. Like most of those guys grew up playing AAU ball together. Giannis didn't and he's also not into training, so he really isn't making friends.   I absolutely love his way of thinking. If other players don't give him props and go to his games then it's whatever. It doesn't seem to phase him."
Kevin Durant is the only all time great who is as petty and insecure as Shaq. He's going to slide right into that seat when Shaq retires.
So lazy how everyone on this subreddit just loves to hate on whoever lost the most recent game smh  Reminds me of how this place was an anti-Giannis forum when the Bucks were down against the Nets.   [As the great kevin durant once said](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1376187247461023746)
yeah cause they have kevin durant
"&gt; kd is probably an inch or two taller  I thought that myth was laid to rest when KD was actually measured by the Nets to be 6'10"".  I.e. tall for a wing, but kind of undersized for a C.  Giannis has at least an inch on him:  [for example](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/giannis-antetokounmpo-of-the-milwaukee-bucks-talks-with-kevin-durant-picture-id1232700466?s=2048x2048)  What's definitely can't be the case btw is Giannis being the same weight as in 2018 (when he was last measured). 2018 was the tail end of his scrawny phase, he was still quite thin and his measurement was 242 . Then in 2019 he showed up quite buffer, same measurement though because they do not reweigh players often. And he has kept the same ""weight"" ever since. Current Giannis is at least 15 pounds over his 2018 iteration, 20 pounds more likely.  I would put him somewhere between 257-262 and yeah, he is quite bigger than KD too which is easily visible while on court."
"It's not ""ridiculous"" to say otherwise when he got outplayed by Kevin Durant while going against a far worse defense with a far better supporting cast."
"Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James"
kevin durant
When a guy is double teamed that isn't Kevin Durant who just shoots over everyone that isn't a good shot.
"You know those games like tonight where Middleton looks like he can never miss, and just rises over everyone and hits seemingly every single shot no matter where he is on the court?   That's how Kevin Durant is but just all the time."
"He's Kevin Durant, not much needs to be said honestly."
No one beats Kevin Durant. Durant is still winning at life now. I'm like...I mean he's like the chillest dude ever. Don't hate.
i think he is. so does kevin durant
Kevin durant was 2 inches over the line and now the bucs are here
He’d be like Kevin Durant.
Going against Kevin Durant is never easy though
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are significantly better players than him
Is that Kevin Durant?
Lopez twins are basically Kareem and Kevin Durant
“Mr. Kevin Durant sir”
Lmfaooo   “Mr Kevin Durant”
"When Oden was drafted by Portland the GM at the time (Kevin Pritchard) hinted that Minnesota had offered KG for the pick.  Forget Durant for a minute and imagine a Portland team running Brandon Roy, Lamarcus Aldridge and KG for a few years."
or beloved Thunder Alumni Kevin Durant
"RJ Barrett will be considered a top 15 player in the league  Knicks will make it to the ECF once in this timespan   Celtics blow up their core and rebuild  Kevin Durant leaves the Nets (without winning a ring) when he’s a FA and goes back to OKC, and leads them to a ring  Luka Doncic is the best player in the league (but on a different team)  Like you said, Kawhi retires early  Cade Cunningham is first team All NBA in 2026, leads the pistons to the ECF, but is not the best player in his draft  Jalen Green wins an MVP in 2026 and leads the Rockets to the finals  Kings finally make the playoffs  Lebron retires in 2025, after playing with Bronny. Wins a ring with Bronny.   Trae Young leaves the Hawks to help form a super team out west, with Nikola Jokic  Suns and CP3 win back to back rings this year and next year   Devin Booker wins 1 MVP  Giannis wins another MVP and a ring in 2023  Seattle and Las Vegas get expansion teams, bringing the NBA to 32 teams  James Wiseman is traded next summer and thrives with his new team"
"Look at Kevin Durant, James Hardin, Lebron, Russel Westbrook, heck look at just about every player today.   Now rewind 25 years back.  Most big name players had maybe 1 trade , majority of them started and finished with who they was drafted with.  The game has changed because these Gen Y &amp; Z kids can’t figure out how to stay loyal to their teams and city.  When Lebron dropped Cleveland I lost all respect for him, then he tries to run back, but look he ran away again."
"Isn’t a super team 3+ star players? Like the Nets, or when KD was on the Warriors.  Kevin Durant + Kyrie Irving + James Harden  Stephen Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant.  I’m not referring to the Clippers here, but some 2 star player teams do give the definition a run for its money though."
Kevin Durant is not Giannis. Big fucking difference.
"&gt; Team missing their 2nd best player has worse record than when they have their 2nd best player.  Lol uh yeah it's a little different when that second best player takes your team from a 62.5% win rate to an 86.2% win rate.   Again, nobody is saying Chris Paul was as good as a player as Harden was at the time. Just that he was the team leader, therefore he led the team. And also that without him the Rockets of those years would've never been in that position regardless.   Harden is awesome. An all time great. But he couldn't bring as much success to those teams alongside any other player in the NBA that he did with Chris Paul. Hell his team doesn't even look as good when he's next to Kevin Durant, and objectively better player than Chris Paul **ever** was. Chris Paul was the catalyst for that teams success, plain and simple."
"Yeah.. CP is not that great of a defender anymore lol, I really dont know why he has that rep still. He does some stuff offball, a steal there, a help double here, and he holds his own aggainst bigger players, but other than that he is just there, not like he is guarding point of attack at any point in the game, he usually guards the Danny Greens, PJ Tuckers of the world, while Mikal gets the best player, be that Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, and even Book guards guys like Conley, Lowry when need be."
"yeah youre right lets not blame kd for completely shitting the bed in the 2016 wcf, he was taking more shots than westbrook in games 5-7 and still completely bricking  but youve probably deleted that series from you brain considering how embarrassing it was, then imagine joining that team directly after lmaoooooo what a fkin scrub  &amp;#x200B;  imagine if curry joined the cavs after the 2016 finals, thats literally what kevin durant ACTUALLY did"
"Kemba Walker, Kevin Durant, and Kareem are a few others lol  Also Jeff Goldblum"
"I said that Kevin Durant is the frontrunner, not Mikal Bridges.   You people do realize that Durant is also having a really fucking good season?"
"This sub loves piling on the Lakers, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being 18-3?  I didn’t realize until now that the Suns are currently 18-3.. why is no-one talking about this?  They won against an amazing Warriors team today and even won by 6 pts to the Nets with a sizzling Kevin Durant. And from what I know they’re just about fully healthy.   For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what’s the main reason for the early season success? It's not surprising they’d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing Finals run.."
Kevin Durant retire?
"Jesus, it's Game 21 of the regular season. They got Kevin Durant because what the fuck else were they gonna do? Just be like ""nah I'm good"" when a top three player wanted to join them?"
I'll never forgive Kevin Durant for taking away this kind of warriors basketball from us for several years
"No it's more chill than that, Kevin Durant is arguably the best basketball player in the world. It isn't an insult to the teammates that the team plays worse with him on the bench."
Tbh you deserve it for not simply signing Kevin Durant. Rookie mistake tbh
I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am.
"Reggie miller: ""Former mvp james harden""  ""Former mvp kevin durant""  "" *Former* M V P derrick rose""  Derrick rose is a good player why does he always sound so surprised"
"This clown said Harden has never been on a team he could play off ball with, somehow forgetting he’s been teammates with Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving all within the last 3 season 💀💀💀"
"Yes, the smart thing to do against James Harden and Kevin Durant is lazily go for easy rebounds."
"""julius randle slips as Kevin durant double dribbles"""
Yo this Kevin Durant guy has been kinda buns tonight
"Over a large sample size raw on/off is still bad... because of the rawness.  Kevin Durant on/off net rating with the Warriors, full regular seasons.  - +8.6  - +1.9  - +16.1  The team around him was mostly the same and his quality of play was mostly the same."
Kevin Durant just lightweight dropped Julius Randle
Kevin Durant and Patty Mills
Kevin Durant would fucking feast with those rules
Look at Bobby Portis top 5 from 3pt! He's also grabbing 8.4 RBD per game. He's a poor mans Kevin Durant and he's also Mayor of Milwaukee. Crazy Bucks got him for Vet Min this year.
The one that has Kevin Durant
Dude the way he balled out in high school and college and even in his first summer league game and then just turned into Kevin Durant in Thunderstruck ONLY says he got injured somehow. Or just the crazy case of Yips ever
"Well, there’s no denying it was a special season. Guess it kinda wore off for the voters after doing it again though. However, because it was special, it was an exception. Outside of that, MVPs have always been from the top seeds in each conference.  Westbrook also had that narrative that season as well. Kevin Durant leaves to go form a superteam with the team that broke the nba record for regular season wins… the lone superstar left in Oklahoma City goes out and averages a triple double, not done since Oscar Robertson, and in his record-setting game for triple doubles in a season, sinks the Nuggets out of their playoff hopes with a 30 foot dagger from deep… quite easy to sell for the voters."
"I loved that sequence in the Christmas game, Kevin Durant tried to stare down Love and then he ignored him to make that crazy pass lol"
yeah thats why montrezl harrell is better than kevin durant it's so obvious everybody knows it
"Yeah, Magic played on great teams. He was fortunate in that sense. But you do realize Curry played with KD for 2 of his rings?  The one ring he didnt win with Durant wasn’t necessarily this historic path either…He beat the Harden-Rockets in the WCF whose 2nd offensive option was a post-prime Josh Smith. In the Finals, they versed the Cavs with a hurt Bron and no Kyrie/Kevin  If your argument for Curry is revolving around superteams or hard paths, it’s not really going to hold up"
I forgive Kevin Durant and Chris Paul
Kevin Durant
"What makes you sound stupid is claiming every all time great has been dominant on both ends of the ball. Most have been dominant on one end of the ball and good on the other end. Steph doesn't have the wingspan to block shots or the body to guard the post, but his perimeter defense has been all-defense worthy so far this season. Also, to reiterate my point since you obviously didn't fully grasp it, my point was never that that he's better than those players, but definitely that he's been more impactful. He changed the game, that's not just a cliche. Defenses have had to adjust around players before, but other than all time great big men, nobody has made the entire league reevaluate the way team defense is played. Just curious, how often did MJ see a box and one? Or Kobe? Or LeBron? Teams have been adjusting the way they guard Curry for the last decade and he continues to stay ahead of the game. I'm not saying Curry is the GOAT. What I'm saying is we've seen changes to the league to a degree that nobody has seen since the days of Kareem BECAUSE of Steph Curry. Anyone can be bigger, faster, stronger, and there have always been those guys so there's a precedent. Curry made the entire league reevaluate their approach to the 3-point shot, on both sides of the ball. The way the 3-point shot is taken nowadays is because of him. The way the 3 point shot is guarded nowadays is because of him. The 3 point line extends to 23 feet, half court is 47. Steph Curry singlehandedly showed the league that you can actually use those extra 24 feet when you're orchestrating your offense. Lebron is probably the GOAT and he didn't change the league in any significant way. Same with Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Kawhi, Kobe, Giannis, Jokic, or anyone else. You're arguing that Steph isn't as good as some other people but that was never my point. My point was about his impact."
Even Kevin Durant who was one of the most dominant college basketball players I've ever seen couldn't do this with a couple of other NBA players on his team.   Winning the NCAA championship is much more about coaching than anything. The NBA caters much more to its stars.
"Team is healthy again and playing well together. Kevin Durant is an exceptional player that can take over and help win a game, but the chemistry of this warriors team before him and now this season is just off the charts. So fun to watch."
I mean they have one of the best regular season players of all time in James Harden no matter how he’s playing this year and they also still have Kevin Durant who can basically make everything out of nothing
Are you Kevin Durant *and* Steph Curry?
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Andre Iguodala   Kevin Durant   Draymond Green  It’s pretty obvious why they targeted Steph.
Kevin Durant.
"I never said it would make him look bad, i said it wouldn't make him look as good.  If we don't use this cherrypicked made up stat Steph isn't the only player with a high TS% while averaging 20+, guys like Adrian Dantley, Kevin Durant, Charles Barkley and Amar'e would all make the list.  Kevin Durant by the way, who has a higher TS% than Steph while averaging the same amount of points on less FGA this year."
"There's only one argument.  Kevin Durant.  With how close their play is this season, even that's not a great argument."
Pippen would be getting barked at by MJ and Rodman for letting Kevin Durant shoot over him repeatedly.

Kevin Durant would be the only argument
"&gt; I legitimately don’t know where the narrative of him being a bad defender came from.  He used to get targeted on switches by other teams.  Notably, when the rest of the defensive lineup was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant.  The ""no shit Steph is the weak link"" lineup. Did you know he's also a worse rim protector than Rudy Gobert?"
two words. Kevin Durant
"Curry was rattled that first year in the Finals. If Lebron (the actual best player in the league for the last 7 years) had any actual formidable team around him that year, Warriors would have been in serious trouble trying to get by on that performance from Curry. The second year in the Finals he got directly outperformed by his matchup, Kyrie. And couldn’t close out a 3-1 advantage, despite being the supposed best player in the league. And you act like he straight up chose to play worse than KD lol. That’s such a cop out. KD just flat out was the best player on that team. Think back to the Rockets Warriors matchup that went to 7 games. Hell, Chris Paul outplayed Curry in that individual matchup as well. The one consistent thing in the Warriors last two championships that no team had an answer for? Kevin Durant. That’s why he was rightfully the Finals MVP both times."
Kevin Durant is 6 inches taller.
Having Kevin Durant on your team definitely fixes a lot of things
"Its not the same, teams trap curry off the ball from near the half court line. he is constantly seeing 2-3 bodies because he is capable of blowing a game open from anywhere on the court. Teams have conceded layups to Kevin freakin Durant because they are so hyper focused on taking away stephs 3 ball  With Giannis teams will build a wall to prevent him from getting to the paint and his gravity as a roller is also pretty devestating. But there are parts of his game that you can absolutely disrespect, and teams have done so even in the championship year."
"Last post-season, Giannis said Kevin Durant is the best player in the world. When your peers say your that good it should be taken of notice since they actually play against him"
I mean Harden and AD gonna be the best lob duo of all time but he still isn't worth fucking Kevin Durant lmao. Even with WB attached
"Nets got Aldridge and Mills with the best player in the league, Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant is worth more than AD and WB, Lakers had wb, ad, and washed vets"
Now imagine someone like Kevin Durant joining that team and with Klay healthy. That's would just be so unfair
A guy named Kevin Durant is active
"LeBron's never played with someone dumb enough to take the ball away from him in crunch time before  Remember we're talking about a guy who thought he was a better scorer and should take more shots than Kevin Durant, it wouldn't surprise me if he thinks he's a better option to run an offense than LeBron James"
Kevin Durant being in the league is the only argument
"Curry isn’t always efficient in every series. He underperformed severely in 15-16 and got locked down by Kevin Love. Kyrie outplayed Curry that series. Curry also avgd 22 against the Rockets in 19, with Durant being the best player for the Warriors, Harden avgd 35 and was the best player that series. It’s up on who is hot or not. If Kyrie and LeBron are hot GG. If Curry and Thompson light up then GG. Doesn’t matter who’s better team"
"Kevin Durant. I'd say there's an argument there.  That's about it, though."
Kevin Durant exists
"He’s the first freshman since Kevin Durant to score 20+ ppg &amp; shoot 40% from 3, was the best of all the prospects in college and showed potential to be an elite ball handler at 6’7 220 pounds"
"He's up one game, not really what I would call ""all of them""  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/stephen-curry-vs-kevin-durant-head-to-head-record-since-2013-including-playoffs"
"yeah, he’s amazing. the only thing i can think of is in a close game down the stretch when you need a bucket but  the defense is focused on stopping steph, they can force the ball out of his hands. someone bigger like kevin durant can get you that clean shot when the game is on the line."
Kevin Durant. That’s my argument.
Kevin Durant existing.   Those 2 are the clear cut top 2 with Giannis a step below them
"Kevin Durant is ranked 15th all time in FT%. He averages more free throws per game than anyone inside the top 40 for FT% (Trae Young currently averages the same attempts at #42 in FT%).   Basically, consistency is hard. Only 14 people shoot better than him in all history and all of them have taken much fewer shots than he has. It's so hard to be a 90%+ FT shooter and almost impossible on high volume (no one has ever done it on his volume)"
"“Hey Ty, just checking in on how you’re doing man. Congrats on the championship, by the way we just replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant for free. Anyway gotta go bro”"
Kevin Durant on Patrick Mills: “I call him The Weeknd sometimes. He just be looking like him for no reason.”
Did you look at their box numbers when you made this post?   Both giannas and Kd were going neck and neck in all statiscal categories.   You don't win a championship by luck. You verse nba ready players for 4 straight series. Some championships are harder then the other. I disagree winning a championship is the whole point of a sport.   If that's the case Karl Malone is better then kevin durant.

I'd fucking hope Kevin durant and harden could score some points on thr suns bench  Your comments make it so insanely obvious you didn't watch the game
- Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant played 45 minutes in that game.  What the fuck?
&gt;Edit2: Also you just got Kevin Durant randomly too lmao  You mean a superstar joined a team with good culture and good coaching.... and because of good drafting had the money to pay someone.... waow
"Perception means a lot. Daryl Morey banned nicknames for players from his draft room when they missed on Marc Gasol in draft. Everyone referred to him as ""man boobs"".   &gt;For instance, in the 2007 draft there had been a player his model really liked: Marc Gasol. Gasol was twenty-two years old, a seven-foot-one center playing in Europe. The scouts had found a photograph of him shirtless. He was pudgy and baby-faced and had these jiggly pecs. The Rockets staff had given Marc Gasol a nickname: Man Boobs. Man Boobs this and Man Boobs that. “That was my first draft in charge and I wasn’t so brave,” said Morey. He allowed the general ridicule of Marc Gasol’s body to drown out his model’s optimism about Gasol’s basketball future, and so instead of arguing with his staff, he watched the Mem­phis Grizzlies take Gasol with the 48th pick of the draft. The odds of getting an All-Star with the 48th pick in the draft were well below one in a hundred. The 48th pick of the draft basically never even yielded a useful NBA bench player, but already Marc Gasol was proving to be a giant exception. (Gasol became a two-time All-Star in 2012 and 2015 and, by Houston’s reckoning, the third-best pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade, after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.) The label they’d stuck on him clearly had affected how they valued him: names mattered. “I made a new rule right then,” said Morey. “I banned nicknames.”  http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2016/12/how_daryl_morey_used_behavioral_economics_to_revolutionize_the_art_of_nba.html"
"Kevin Durant. I loved watching those OKC teams, and they were honestly my favorite team when I started to get into watching the NBA. Used to be my favorite player by far, and then ditched the team and turned into a straight up diva. Obviously an amazing player but I hated that move so much"
"He enters into that discussion, and same thing with Kevin Durant, then it just depends on who you're taking out of that top 10"
"Kevin Durant &amp; Kyrie Irving.   Durant NOT for joining the warriors but for trying to explain that it wasn’t a weak ass move. If he just went “yeah, I joined the best team. Fuck you” I would not have had a problem.   Kyrie is self explanatory"
Lol you mean Kevin Durant with role players and borderline amputated James Harden?
Kevin Durant
"You guys never did that though. You just drafted Steph, Klay, Draymond then pretty much waited. The only important pieces you got were Andrew Bogut and Iggy and the Blazers are not a Bogut and Iggy away from a championship.  Edit: also what impactful trades have we not made.  Edit2: Also you just got Kevin Durant randomly too lmao"
"I've been watching basketball for about 30 years, and I'm a bit sick of hearing that KG would be best at anything if he was playing today. Honestly, he's on the same level as Anthony Davis. Couldn't do shit with his original team, even though he did have a few all-stars during his time there. Then he joined other hall of famers and won a title, and now he's a top 10 of all time, or whatever ridiculous rating he's given on these boards..  Compare that to any of the players on the list - these are all players carrying their teams. First round exits by player:  Curry: 1  LBJ: 1  Jokic: 0  Giannis: 3  Kevin Durant: 1  So he's basically had more first round exits in a row than the rest of the players we're comparing him to had combined for the career.  Oh, and about the help: Cassel and Sczerbiak both made all-star, and he also had some solid role players in Billups, Laphonso Ellis, Marbury, Terrell Brandon, Gugliota, Laettner, Isaiah Rider etc.  For comparison, Jokic had 0 all-stars playing next to him, and hasn't had a first round exit to date."
Kevin Durant
"Well then I don’t know what the fuck your point is since stars still take a ton of midrange shots. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, CP3, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Kyrie Irving, etc. all take a shit ton of midrange shots. Even stars who aren’t good at them like LeBron, Jayson Tatum, or Anthony Davis shoot them all the time.  Most of the change we’ve seen is role players shooting threes instead of spotting up for abysmal long twos that they should never take except if they’re at risk of a shot clock violation."
So Kevin Durant wasn’t the reason the warriors were so good.
"Being a scorer and a floor general are not mutually exclusive. A scorer is not just a kind of player, it is a role; one that can be shared with other roles to be carried out by a singular player.  Someone like Chris Paul is a good example of exactly the kind of player you are thinking of, not LeBron.  For comparison:  CP3 averages 13.6 FGA and 9.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron averages 19.5 FGA and 7.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron for his career, shoots the ball nearly 3 times as many times as he assists on a successful shot. CP3 can score, but he cannot do it in high volume like LeBron can. LeBron can and does so, thus he is a scorer.  CP3’s job is to run the offense and set up guys, while scoring here and there. LeBron’s job is to also set up his teammates, but half the time he is running his offense, he is also looking to score.  You can’t average 19.5 FGA and 27 PPG for your 19 year career without prioritising your scoring when you run the team’s offense.  For comparison, Kevin Durant, who is known first and foremost as a scorer, averages 18.6 FGA for his career.  Kobe Bryant, who is infamously known as a chucker, averaged 19.5 FGA for his career. The same amount as LeBron James. Even excluding Kobe’s rookie year, he averaged 20.2 FGA for his career, only 0.7 more than LeBron.  So how is it that KD and Kobe, who average 18.6 FGA and 19.5 FGA respectively, are scorers, but LeBron who shoots the ball more than KD and averages the same 19.5 FGA for his career as Kobe, is “not a scorer”?  It just simply sounds silly to not call LeBron a scorer. Just because LeBron runs the offense and is the primary playmaker of his team does not mean he’s a scorer.  If you can’t understand something as simple as a player holding multiple roles and abilities that even a child can understand, then I sadly can’t help."
"I’d like to go back to this point. I heavily disagree. Being a scorer and a floor general are not mutually exclusive. A scorer is not just a kind of player, it is a role; one that can be shared with other roles to be carried out by a singular player.  Someone like Chris Paul is a good example of exactly the kind of player you’re thinking of, not LeBron.  For comparison:  CP3 averages 13.6 FGA and 9.4 Assists for his career.

The same amount as LeBron James. Even excluding Kobe’s rookie year, he averaged 20.2 FGA for his career, only 0.7 more than LeBron.  So how is it that KD and Kobe, who average 18.6 FGA and 19.5 FGA respectively, are scorers, but LeBron who shoots the ball more than KD and averages the same 19.5 FGA for his career as Kobe, is “not a scorer”?  It just simply sounds silly to not call LeBron a scorer. Just because LeBron runs the offense and is the primary playmaker of his team does not mean he’s a scorer.  If you had said “he’s not just a scorer, he’s an offensive juggernaut” then you’re not wrong, but to say he’s not a scorer simply is.  Calling LeBron a scorer isn’t undermining him, it is simply stating one of the facets of his game. He is a offensive juggernaut, precisely because he is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history along with being nearly equally great at being a floor general."
"I’d like to go back to this point. I heavily disagree. Being a scorer and a floor general are *not* mutually exclusive. A scorer is not just a kind of player, it is a role; one that can be shared with other roles to be carried out by a singular player.  Someone like Chris Paul is a good example of exactly the kind of player you’re thinking of, *not* LeBron.  For comparison:  CP3 averages 13.6 FGA and 9.4 Assists for his career.   LeBron averages 19.5 FGA and 7.4 Assists for his career.  LeBron for his career, shoots the ball nearly 3 times as many times as he assists on a successful shot. CP3 can score, but he cannot do it in high volume like LeBron can. LeBron can and does so, thus he is a scorer.  CP3’s job is to run the offense and set up guys, while scoring here and there. LeBron’s job is to also sets up his teammates, but half the time he is running his offense, he is also looking to score.   You can’t average 19.5 FGA and 27 PPG for your 19 year career without prioritising your scoring when you run the team’s offense.  For comparison, Kevin Durant, who is known first and foremost as a scorer, averages 18.6 FGA for his career.  Kobe Bryant, who is infamously known as a chucker, averaged 19.5 FGA for his career. The same amount as LeBron James. Even excluding Kobe’s rookie year, he averaged 20.2 FGA for his career, only 0.7 more than LeBron.  So how is it that KD and Kobe, who average 18.6 FGA and 19.5 FGA respectively, are scorers, but LeBron who shoots the ball more than KD and averages the same 19.5 FGA for his career as Kobe, is “not a scorer”?

He is a offensive juggernaut, precisely because he is one of the greatest scorers in NBA history along with being nearly equally great at being a floor general."
"Look at Dwayne Wade early in his career. Or Dwight Howard. Derrick Rose. Anthony Davis.   Hell, even Kevin Durant. They all came into the league firing, and none except *maybe* Kevin Durant are considered top 10 players, and Durant was far better in his first few years than Luka was."
"Eh, it's a somewhat decent comparison but I think a better comparison would be a Center having elite ball-handling/play-making skills.  Centers in the modern era can definitely shoot the 3 ball, it's not exactly rare. What is extremely rare is seeing a 7 footer glide down the court while handling the ball, using moves like euro-steps or step-backs, etc.   This is how you get once in a lifetime guys like Shohei Ohtani and Giannis/Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant.  And yes, I know we don't exist anymore.  I'm a Jazz fan since the Sonics disappeared, but I honestly don't have anyone on that roster right now that I dislike."
"This is generally what I do. It makes zero sense to compare players like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry to Wilt, Russell, West, Robertson, etc. The game and league were just too different."
1 Chris Paul  1 Michael Jordan  1 Kevin Durant  1 Karl Malone  1 Shaquille O Neal
"It's all relative. The Jazz have been tearing through the regular season for a few years now, but no one takes them seriously because everyone knows they can't match up with the best in the playoffs.   I think the thing about the Nets right now is they don't look like a team that can win a tough playoff matchup. The bench sucks ass and they don't have a lot of chemistry yet. Will they get it? Maybe. But they've gone from a superteam to a question mark, with their only sure thing being Kevin Durant is an amazing scorer."
It’s crazy but I have this theory that Harden and Kevin Durant are actually two different people.
Funny enough Kevin Durant said something similar about “measuring stick” when we beat the suns last season with Kyrie

"Totals is a shit measure of longevity objectively, no matter how you define longevity, which is the ONLY ambiguous and subjective part as it encompasses years, durability, career consistency, and actual performance as a scorer scored within basketball games. And it's still shit for all of them. Context is the most important thing behind any statistic, and totals lacks any context behind those variables that underpin it, and that is the root of its problem in trying to measure anything. You have no idea where the points are coming from, how much is attributed to each variable, only that these players have accumulated these points, under vastly different circumstances, career trajectories etc.  * if you weighed injury resistance heavily as longevity you have players who struggle to stay on the court (Chris Paul no.45) outperforming players who are ironmen (John Stockton no.49).   * If you weigh years played heavily as longevity you have players (Bob Petit no.40) outperforming players who played half the years of others (Scottie Pippen no.62)  * If you weigh consistent performance over a long period of time heavily you still have no way of discerning from totals whether someone was a truly great scorer for a long time (James Harden no.32) or was simply an above-average scorer who played forever (Ray Allen no.24). Also see Kevin Durant vs almost everyone above him.  * It doesn't tell you anything about career consistency. Eg. over 80% of Wilts points were accumulated before he hit 30 (over 9 seasons), he averaged 18ppg in his remaining seasons 30 - 36. yet he's 7th in all time scoring purely because he averaged almost 40ppg over 9 seasons. Meanwhile Dirk who is right next to him maintained a consistent level of performance over a long period of time.  And the result of this shitshow is so easily demonstrated by removing player names and comparing stats, example:   * Player A - 19711 points total (no.49). Player B - 18713 points total (no.63). who's the better longevity scorer? Most people would pick A.   * I'll divulge more stats: Player A averaged between 14 - 23 points per 100 possessions over 20 seasons. Player B - averaged between 23.1 - 44 points per 100 possessions over 13 seasons. Literally zero overlap in scoring. Who's the better longevity scorer? almost everyone would change their pick to Player B now. These 2 ppl btw are John Stockton and Stephen Curry.  Moving onto Lebron, Lebron has essentially recorded more points per 100 possessions than Kareem every year, every phase of their career. Now late in his 30s, Lebron is recording a full 10 points per 100 possessions more than Kareem at the same phase of their career. Lebron is already the more accomplished longevity scorer by any objective observer. And this again goes all the way back to the problem of points total, Kareem despite scoring less in every stage of his career has more total points simply because he played more games. Has nothing to do with his prowess as a scorer, nothing to do with his ability to sustain his level better, absolutely nothing to do with performance, and given both players have played 19+ seasons, clearly nothing to do with ""longevity"", it's simply a matter of running the numbers and playing the requisite number of games.    Same thing with Jordan. The man averaged more points per 100 possession aged 38 than Kareem ever did in his career. He's scored an order of magnitude more than Kareem ever did at any stage of their careers. The man also played 15 seasons, stretching from 21-39. He's a better scorer longevity wise than Kareem. It's pretty clear the only reason he didn't pass Kareem when he retired is because he decided not to chill on the wizards for longer, or stay on after the second 3peat.   TLDR: This whole points total thing is dumb no matter what angle or definition you look at it. It's even dumber when you consider the public's fixation with it as some great measure of longevity. If you still don't get it at this point, all I can say is good luck, have a nice day, and your job that requires any critical thinking. Ciao"
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant and Golden State.  I think fans are wholly justified in being angry with players who force their way off the team while under contract, and toxically entitled if they complain about players who leave in free agency.  A free agent owes you nothing."
2018 Warriors had the same core as the 2016 Warriors *and Kevin Durant*. The team that lost in 7 games to that squad with their second best player injured would easily beat the 2016 Warriors
What?? The best offense in basketball is give Kevin Durant the ball and get the hell out the way.
"As he said himself, LeBron is the best player in the world.  Or Kevin Durant like he said during the playoffs. I don't know. Giannis seems to think like the average r/NBA user"
Yeah but it's Kevin Durant lol  His TS% that season was 63.5%
"I mean, the first statement isn't false. Roberson, Westbrook, Adams, Ibaka, Kanter, and some Waitors here and there is very elite defensively, but very bad spacing which ultimately cost them the series vs the Warriors. The Nets are a stacked offensive team because of Kevin Durant. And I'm not really counting the games where he had Kyrie and Harden because they also take shots away from him. I'm talking about games 4-7, KD turns it up with no Kyrie and Harden on one leg"
I think you’re severely underrating Kevin Durant
You don’t know a thing Kevin Durant. The Clippers have been clowned in LA as long as they’ve been around. We just both happen to be competing at the same time now; how could there not be animosity? Lol
Kevin Durant is arguably the greatest playoff scorer of all time in my eyes. Put him on the Bulls and they win 6 rings as well
"I'm assuming you're referring to the [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32260331/nbarank-2021-ranking-best-players-2021-22-5-1) and [SI](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/09/23/ranking-best-nba-players-top-100-2022-kevin-durant-giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james) lists. But your question ignores grammatical tense of those articles -- your question is in the *present tense* while those two outlets issued *predictions* in *future tense*. You aren't asking a question answered by them, no wonder you don't agree.  ==================  SI:  &gt;Who **will be** the NBA’s best players in the 2021–22 season?  ESPN:  &gt;We asked, ""Which player **will be** better in 2021-22?"" Voters had to predict what they expected from each player during the season.  u/Hot-Ad5735:  &gt;Who’s (i.e. who **is**) better?"
"They don't care that he posts videos, they care that he isn't showing up and isn't being aggressive enough on offense  Nobody gives a fuck about videos, i've seen videos of Mitchell Robinson looking like KD that he posts, are you angry about that? Are Knicks fans angry about it? That he doesn't go in game and act like Kevin Durant   https://www.instagram.com/p/CF2IJ54pRTU/   This was last year,  SHIT ABOUT TO GET REAL with 3s   He went 0/0 in threes"
You think Kevin Durant could outrun Simmons. Fox. Players like that?
“I’m Kevin Durant. Y’all know who I am”  Then destroyed them
"I get what you’re saying , but the Nets’ big 3 didn’t play many games together last season and still played very well together when they did. Even when it was just 2 of the 3 of them playing. There’s simply too much talent to not be able to make it work. This isn’t a Boston situation because it’s Harden and Kevin Durant that he’s playing with , two top 10 (at the absolute minimum) players."
kevin durant does not dribble high.
It's Kevin Durant
"&gt; Yes he was still raw at that point and once again, it was not until MJ was 24 that his team finished above .500 or advanced past the first round of the playoffs. James Worthy went on to average 13.4 ppg the following year, so again to argue that MJ was going to be tearing up the league out of high school or as a one-and-done is completely asinine.  &gt; If your argument is that MJ is the GOAT over LeBron because once he lost to the Pistons enough times, he learned from it and hit an untouchable peak where he just couldn't lose and that overrules the sum total of LeBron's career, I'd personally disagree because there are years he didn't win a championship where he was as good or better than he was in '96 or whatever and the difference was that he had better teammates, but at least there's some kind of logic.  &gt; Saying that MJ's legacy would be better if he entered the league straight out of high school is just silly because we can already see that it took a few years for MJ to be the undisputed best player in the league and again, the argument for MJ is already pretty much just '6-0 in the Finals' so it seems like additional years of not having that much team success would be more likely to hurt than help him.  &gt; Giannis and LeBron both won their first championships at the same age as MJ did with his. I'm not so hung up on the idea of LeBron being the GOAT that I can't acknowledge that while you could say this year's championship was somewhat weaker due to all the injuries, there's at least some non-zero chance that Giannis improves his shooting to the point that he ends up better than either of them.  &gt; With Jordan though (and a lot of other older players), it's more about the story where because they entered the league closer to their prime, a higher percentage of their career is on teams that win big and they don't get as much of a 'loser' reputation. If MJ had an additional 3 years at the beginning of his career where his team wasn't winning and it was then year 9 where the Bulls still couldn't get past the Pistons, I assure you he would be looked at at least somewhat differently.  &gt; Just consider someone like Kevin Durant, who was leading the league in scoring and playing for a 50+ win team at the age MJ was a rookie. Throw those earlier years out and he's been on a 50+ win team every healthy year of his career, and if the Nets win the title this season like they're favored to you could say he's got 3 titles in the 10 years he's been healthy to finish the season and could very well have a couple more with better injury luck. Now I don't think he's at MJ's level, but those three additional years of losing at the beginning of his career have certainly made him underrated when considering whether he should go down as a top 10 player of all time.   lol, i think you replied to the wrong person"

I think the answer is Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
&gt; Man what more does Giannis have to do before everyone agrees he's the best player in the league.  Be better than Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant ended his engagement because he needed time to focus on basketball
"Best scorer ever and Kevin Durant, Kobe, Lebron, Kareem and Harden are not close to Jordan as a scorer"
"In this situation co-stars is referring back to the subject of the sentence which is Kevin Durant. It’s grade school English man, come on now.  And Lebron wasn’t injured. It’s the same pathetic excuse every time. It’s like when he had a “broken hand”. It’s pathetic as fuck. He played full minutes and was in no way limited. He just couldn’t get it done."
Tho in the 2021-2022 season Kevin Durant is tied with Kyle Kuzma in points so far. Borderline all-star might be a stretch for KD.
jesus christ do not put kevin durant at center he weighs like 200 pounds  he would get killed by any actual center
Yet Doncic isn't even the leading scorer during his own playoff career.

"Best Player Ever: Michael Jordan  Best Scorer: Kevin Durant  Best Offensive Player: Steph Curry  Best 2-Way Player: LeBron James  Best Defender: Hakeem Olajuwon  Now I'm just imagining a line-up of Curry, Jordan, Durant, LeBron and Hakeem"
As opposed to Kevin Durant who won 3 years in a row? Or anyone else?
Kevin Durant has not and will never be the best player in the NBA
"I think once Lebron retires people will generally consider them equal, with Lebron having more longevity and feats, whereas Jordan having a higher peak and perfection.   While I used to shit on Lebron for his finals record, we have to also account for the fact that finals appearances are worth something in itself.  6-0 in that decade was incredible. But Lebron having tons of finals appearances with 3 separate teams over the course of two distinctly different eras is extremely impressive.  Also, that Kevin Durant warriors team would have beat the bulls too."
"[Yes.

"Kevin Durant, borderline all-star"
"&gt; The argument is that Kevin Durant is better. As a basketball player.  He's not though, he doesn't impact winning as much as Giannis Antetokounmpo does."
0. Boban   1. Kevin Durant.      Didn’t want to hurt Kds feelings and have his burners go off.
The argument is that Kevin Durant is better. As a basketball player.  I'll never understand people who just look at achievements.
"Nothing close to that. Outside of the recent times injury riddled campaigns, they’ve been a playoff team in the western conference since 2013. Not to mention the rings and finals appearances. Oh and the whole Kevin Durant thing. Almost forgot about that one."
"For fucking real.  Uhhh yeah any gsw fan that wants to complain is getting a big ol ""boo hoo"" from me on this one. 5 straight finals, 2 mvps, 3 titles, signing Kevin Durant after greatest regular season of all time and now all of a sudden theres a curse cause the guy who got you a top 10 draft pick this year is refusing to get vaccinated? Even when the warriors have losing seasons they find ways to squeeze out moral victories. The only reason they have kumknga rn is cause they got dlo in a sign and trade when durant went to brooklyn  Fwiw Klays injuries are nothing short of a tragedy and no one deserves that kind of horrible luck and hes a good dude it seems, but like cmon man then the nuggets (murray), lakers (brons groin in 18-19 and ad's everything), nets (all of last season), clippers (kawhi), and celtics (hayward and kemba) are all cursed too. Fuck it the knicks are cursed then too cause mitchell robinson broke his foot last season and he couldve helped against capela in the playoffs  Edits for fixing typos"
"OKC has even less appeal than NO, and yet that didn't stop Kevin Durant from getting more endorsements than you can shake a stick at shortly after he broke out playing for the Thunder."
A lot of people underrate Kawhi offensively because he isn't super flashy  But his percentages are literally most similar to guys like Larry Bird and Kevin Durant
"there is literally no lineup you can put together that would be ""hell in a handbasket"" with James Harden and Kevin Durant on your team. In fact, it's like the best possible scenario fro Simmons."
I don't think you need to be that worried about shot creation with James Harden and Kevin Durant on your team....
they got james harden and fucking kevin durant to be the shot creators and volume scorers hahaha
I have ingrained in my mind people giving wide open runaways to the basket to Kevin Durant because they noticed Curry was going to the corner.   You never had two offensive players of this calibre together and the defense/physicality is an issue but I really see the argument since offense is the most important side of the court the way the game is played. It's a 'defensible' take.
My point isnt lebron will be the best for 5 years. My point is. If Lebron outplays Kevin Durant. I think the bs that Kevin was better last year Even if bron wasnt injured (takes brought by skip bayless) Is completely wrong. Whether AD outplays him in the one series. Heres my thought. If AD outplays lebron in the finals they both outplay Kd but lebron outplayed AD all playoffs besides that. Who is the best player on the court (Not including kyrie harden russ)
"Yes, but the thing is Kevin Durant is a literal once in a lifetime player. I don't think the longevity should be questioned. The fact that he was able to recover from an Achilles and played 3 playoff games, back against the wall for almost or the entire 48 minutes is insane. I don't really think it's a waste of time to hypothesize since the top 10 is considerably hard to break into, but KD certainly is the best player to make it there.   Even as a Lakers fan, I have a hard time seeing the Nets choke this ring away unless Kyrie/Harden both suffer crazy injuries again."
"No because just because a player wins the title doesn’t make him the best. It does put him in the convo. KD has a 2-1 record against Lebron in the Finals, if the Nets beat the Lakers and Kevin Durant does great Lebron doesn’t have that angle, now if the Lakers beat the Nets and Davis is clearly better than Lebron but is getting matched by KD? KD is the better  currently."
"I think if you think Kawhi is a better shooter than Kobe, then Kobe isn't top 15 at this point. I value my own ability to evaluate a basketball game. For what it's worth though, I'm not a Kobe stan. And my take on Steph Curry is usually in relation with Kevin Durant who I think is better than Curry and Kobe"
Did he not have james harden? But i Digress. This year everyones takes have been this Kevin Durant&gt;Lebron James James Harden&gt;Anthony Davis Kyrie Irving&gt;Russell Westbrook So my take is this if lebron wins with the “Inferior team” alongside the guy Kevin Durant couldn’t win with and Kevin Durant has a guy who Lebron did win with. I dont ever wanna hear Kevin&gt;Lebron. If Kevin wins this year I think the past year and this year Kevin&gt;Lebron

Best: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Scorer: Kevin Durant  Offense: Stephen Curry  2 way: Hakeem Olajuwon   Defender: Bill Russell
Really this just reminded me why Kevin Durant was the most important player on the Warriors
"Yeah I don’t think so. You’re falsely equivocating the Spurs entire success mainly on Tim Duncan which is false especially when he only has 3 FMVPS. He’s had help, and you cannot tell me the resurgence of the Spurs after their disastrous 2011 season of losing as the 1st seed to the 8th seeded Grizzlies is mainly “Tim Duncan’s efforts and leadership.” The Spurs especially from 2013-2014 were a well oiled machine that went well beyond Tim Duncan as the focal point. And if you’re willing to do that, you have to acknowledge Duncan’s failures of being unable to repeat and often going out in an embarrassing fashion. When it’s all said and done, Kevin Durant will be ranked higher"
"Because of gravity. It’s the same reason as to why Kevin Durant can get a wide open path to dunk the ball in the NBA finals when the defense collapses on Stephen Curry.  NFL defenses collapse around the ball handler which leaves the rest of the field vulnerable to attack.   Now it’s hard to even imagine what a lateral based offense would look like because NFL players at the current moment are massively unskilled and untrained in this skill. We only ever see the laterals in desperation moments at the end of games by guys that have never practiced it.   If NBA players can pass to each other without constantly turning it over, it stands to reason that football players can figure it out too.   The only thing that would be a slight hinderance to this strategy is the face mask obstructing vision somewhat.   The big problem with this strategy is that it’s so against orthodoxy that it will be hard for any coach who even wants to try it to get the opportunity to do it with skilled football players as they will be prevented from even trying to do it from then hive mind. It’s hard to even compare something that doesn’t even get practiced versus the orthodox method that is continuously practiced."
Delusional Morey wants to trade Ben for Kevin Durant and james harden.
so stacked only according to you...I watched since the 90's. when did you?  [here ya go](https://kansascity.sbnation.com/oklahoma-city-thunder/2012/6/7/3070192/kevin-durant-best-player-2012-nba-playoffs-spurs-thunder). any sources from you calling OKC stacked?  and they lost in the 1st round in the West. yet somehow KD can't beat the Pacers lmao  yea and still not healthy. + Lebron having a choking reputation = OKC favorites. not that hard to understand  yea cause Cavs had locker room issues in BOTH 2017 and 2018. bUt LeBrOn SuCh A gReAt LeAdEr
"We'll both played great but Kevin Durant was the best player in the series as far as how the narrative did change, the championship , the right kind of Championship win, combined with people in the media having something against the right player can switch the perception of a lot of things up"
"When Steph ""playoff underperformer"" Curry, Kevin ""can't carry a team"" Durant, Draymond ""triple single"" Green and Klay ""role player"" Thompson go 16-1 in the playoffs but are apparently all trash"
Larry Bird or Kevin Durant
"Yeah the replies here are crazy and mad disrespectful. Lesser players like Kidd, Iverson, and Dwight all carried their teams to the finals playing in the East but Kevin fucking Durant can't?? He's really gonna lose to Victor Oladipo and Bogdanovic??   I guess the Warriors weren't that stacked then based on these people's logic lol"
kevin durant would like a word
Kevin Durant
"I think it's combination of Giannis really stepping up the last three years or so + KD not really having the great accolades that show how fucking good at basketball he actually is.   Starting below is a praise about Kevin Durant so feel free to stop reading here:  Like the guy is a fucking monster, almost 7 feet tall, bombing from anywhere and everywhere, as fast as a guard, he's unstoppable on a decent day and just goes complete god-mode on his good days.   Despite his public image and relative lack of accolades, I personally can't find 10 (or even less) people better than Prime Kevin Durant at the sport of basketball. It's like the guy was born to play basketball or something, man. Giannis may one day be a greater player than Kevin Durant on the all-time rankings, but I can't see him being a better player."
"That really is pretty nuts, though, isn't it? This is a guy that wasn't even an all-star until 2017. Like, Kyrie already had three all-star appearances before Giannis got one. And we're already at the point where it's not crazy to talk about Giannis overtaking Kevin freaking Durant."

Kevin durant easy length and moves plus the ability to score anywhere
&amp;#x200B;  2016: Kevin Durant or Derozan/Lowry (surprised no one mentioned it)  2017: Kyrie Irving  2018: Jimmy Butler  2019: James Harden  2020: Paul George  2021: Ben Simmons
Wanna hear something crazy? Michael Beasley put up comparable stats to Kevin Durant in college:  Kevin: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kevin-durant-1.html  Beasley: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/michael-beasley-1.html
"I think you’re missing the point, you’d be picking players based on their play for your specific team. You’d be getting Kevin Durant from his time as a net, not as a warrior. So Dwight Howard wouldn’t really count and Kevin Garnett would probably be taken out considering he wasn’t that good on the Nets. Also how can you call yourself a Nets fan and leave Dr. J on the bench lmao.  C Kenyon Martin  PF Kevin Durant  SF Dr. J  SG Vince Carter  PG Jason Kidd  James Harden only has 1 season on the Nets, I didn’t really think he’s done more for the franchise in that 1 season compared to Vince. I think if harden has 2 or 3 more great seasons and brings a chip to Brooklyn he’d have that spot in the Nets all time team."
Im surprised that not many people have mentioned Kevin Durant
"See where he said ""Kevin Durant was one of the best college players anyone had seen"""
"kevin durant played shooting guard and then transitioned to a small forward, so if he counts, i want him.  i think kd has a pretty great shot because he just might be the best 1v1 scorer ever"
Kevin Durant if he counts as a swingman
Kevin durant
Kevin Durant
"Fuck KD… but your rules allow for KD, since he started his career as a 2 guard.   Kevin Durant, Kareem, Hakeem, Kobe, Bird, Payton, and Lebron are the only players I would trust to give prime MJ any real competition 1v1, and Kareem is probably the likeliest of those to win but KD is runner up and meets your rules"
"C Dwight Howard (was on the Nets one day in 2018 before being waived)   PF Kevin Garnett   SF Kevin Durant   SG James Harden   PG Jason Kidd  Julius Erving, Kyrie Irving, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe Mutombo, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Andrei Kirilenko etc on the bench."
I will say this again.  Greg Oden was so good he was the consensus pick over Kevin Durant by most people and nobody batted an eye because he was the best big man prospect since Tim Duncan.
"Kevin Durant was one of the best college players anyone had ever seen, and Oden was *still* the consensus #1 pick by a wide margin. A few would have picked Durant, but no one faulted the Oden pick"
LeBron has only won 4 MVPs in the last 14 years. Wtf are you saying man? 2008 and 9 Kobe came second. Kevin Durant came second in his third and 4th one. He also joined the warriors. He only has himself to blame for that.
"Kobe would try the absolute hardest to win. Physically, Tracy McGrady's length would give him probably the best chance (I know Kobe claimed he beat Tracy one-on-one but in their actual televised games T-Mac gave him lots of trouble). Size is such a huge advantage in basketball, especially one-on-one when you don't make special rules like one-shot-per-possession or limiting the number of dribbles.  EDIT: I'm assuming we can't pick Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant would smoke MJ

What about Kevin Durant?

"bro its easy to call klay the 4th best player when the other 3 were Kevin Durant and steph curry , its semi-debatable even whether or not draymond is that much better in terms of value to their offense . the title “all-time great” player doesnt take into consideration whatever player you want to compare , whether that’s kawhi or James harden , it’s a simple yes or no about the player . and the answer is yes for klay , end of story"
"Harden has choked literally almost every playoff series.   Harden's recent playoff stretch (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard -   In 2019: Harden shot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws (3rd worst game of this season by FT%) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable.  2020: 17 point effort on 4 of15 from the field and 1 of 9 from the perimeter.  Even before then;   2012: choked in the finals  2013: choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook, shooting 7/22 at home in the elimination game  2014: choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  This man crumbles when the team needs him most."
"How is the real answer not in any of the comments? Neither the deal nor Morey had as much effect on the trade as the fact that Harden and Durant planned for a reunion. Harden wanted to go to Brooklyn and the Rockets made it happen for him. There was a report that Harden and Durant talked about reuniting on the Nets. It had nothing to do with Morey not offering Maxey or some pettiness regarding Morey. Here's the link to the article: https://abc13.com/james-harden-to-get-traded-brooklyn-nets-houston-rockets-trade-kevin-durant-nba/8013697/  And here's the quote: ""The idea of playing together again came up during Harden and Durant's offseason workouts together in Los Angeles. Sources said the players talked openly about whether the combination could work and how a trade facilitating it could work."" Clearly the Thunder connection was there, and there didn't seem to be as much chemistry with Embiid. The Nets package was ""good enough"" compared to the sixers and they also satisfied Harden's wishes at the same time."
Kevin durant is overated. He hasn't won a scoring title in over 8 years but he's considered the best scorer. He hasn't won an mvp nor carried a franchise in almost a decade but is considered the best player in the nba ? That makes no sense to me .
"I'll start from least to most controversial:  \- Giannis's peak is already the second best for a PF of all time, Garnett was even better defensively but wasn't as good as a scorer  \- Heliocentric ball dominant guards, no matter how much assists they may rack up, make their teammates worse and unless they are a truly elite scorer(example: LeBron) they cannot be the best player on a championship team, as they are only floor and not ceiling raisers(example: Westbrook.) Controversially, I also believe this to apply to current Luka and think the Porzingis situation is partly caused by Luka's extreme ball dominance and refusal to pass early in the shot clock. Players like Curry who can play off ball well will always be better than players who can't, with the SOLE exception of LeBron James.   \- Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are just as good skillwise as Magic and Bird, the only difference is that Magic and Bird didn't have their prime overlap with Jordan the way Curry and Durant did with LeBron. For example, Durant would have threepeated MVP just like Bird did if LeBron wasn't in the league. Also, as I mentioned before, neither one of them needs to hold the ball constantly, which makes them much more ""plug and play"" than other stars."
ESPN: Kevin Durant does not believe he can carry the Nets to a championship. Something something can’t win with these cats.
Kevin as in Kevin Durant II
"ESPN and Podcasts tomorrow,  ""Kevin Durant claims that Nets don't need James Harden to win the championship""!"
"Kevin Durant gets 28-35 points no matter what it feels like watching him during the game. He might be the lowest variance high volume scorer ever. He rarely goes off for 40+, and he'll never have lower than 25"
"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Listen I get that the model looks at injury seasons unfavorably but cmon man lets be real for a second. Even if klay doesnt get his legs back and isnt a great defender anymore or cant drive to hoop like he used to his shooting alone will allow him to be at the very least a rotation player. This same metric has kevin durant, kyrie and bradley beal as borderline allstars while FVV is an allstar?? Likewise in what world in robert covington a borderline allstar?!? I dont care what advanced metrics they used to create this list, anyone with eyes who has actually watched basketball will tell you this list is complete garbage."
"&gt;*The Sixers are well-aware of what they squandered as the No. 1 seed with homecourt in this year's Eastern Conference playoffs. Reflecting on their own second-round loss and citing a number of small moments that helped decide the season's final outcome, a la Kevin Durant stepping on the line in Brooklyn's Game 7 loss to Milwaukee, one source said, ""It shows you how much we fucked it up.""  Lol at least they are aware"
This is kind of outside the box but I'd almost say that Kevin Durant puts up way better stats than you would think while watching him  A lot of times he will get like one bucket every 2-3 minutes the whole game and end up with 30 while you never really notice him the whole time
"Lebron, Steph, Kevin durant, Harden and Kawhi"
I love how 2018 is always used as the example for this argument. That was literally the only good Rockets team Harden has played for.  And even that is nowhere near a 73-9 team PLUS Kevin Durant.
"I think we can match them. Luka is a similar comp to Harden, so we just need to add an Irving and a Kevin Durant from the trade block. Seems doable."
"Off the top of my head, you could make the argument that Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, and Kobe Bryant are better scorers. So I don’t think saying top 5 is anything outrageous"
They say this like the Celtics have a Kevin Durant on their roster or something.
"Not a trade, but what if Kevin Durant went to *literally* any other team? Would his new team beat the 73-9 Warriors? Would Lebron have 6 rings? Would Curry have won another ring or two with a different max player?  So many questions, but instead we got the most boring period of the NBA in years."
He's on the ground holding the ladder steady for the real candidates  He's the third leading scorer on his team and is playing next to Kevin Durant. He doesn't have a chance.
"He was finals mvp lol. And what kind of argument is ""if you replace him with steve nash, the pistons would be better"" No shit sherlock. If you replaced Tayshaun Prince with Kevin Durant they would have been better too."
"&gt;Also: Kevin Durant would not need to form another super team just to beat a 36 year old Lebron, some of you guys have him as a Top 15 All time?, lol.  If this is what you wanted to talk about just make it the thread"

Kevin Durant didn't form a superteam to beat Lemickey 😂
"Bruh the Nets are in their own tier right now from everyone else come playoff time lol. Rn I’m questioning the Lakers’ health, chemistry, and size even with LeBron there AD has been underperforming this year on top of all that, the Bucks and Sixers are routine frauds, I don’t trust PG to not become Pandemic P come playoff time. Utah right now is the closest thing to them because their shooting and star power (playoff Mitchell is a monster) but I just don’t see a team beating a trio of Kevin Durant-James Harden-Kyrie Irving in a 7 game series with their defense actually tightening up finally."
Nets are getting way too disrespected. I don't think you guys realize still who Kevin Durant is. Plus it's not like 6ers have nurse they have rivers.
"Except when Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are on the other team. Which in this case, they are."
"*I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am*  \- Kevin Durant"
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are technically on non max deals.  They both took small pay cuts, their deals each had several bonus clauses, then the Nets signed their off season moves in such an order to add DeAndre Jordan at close to 10M a year over 4 years."
"That's not the argument at all.   &gt;Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  You're using a very generic TS% argument that doesn't actually apply. In the Durant/DJ comparison, both have positive efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a positive addition, therefore you want more of them.   Deandre Jordan = +12  Kevin Durant = +27  +27 &gt; + 12   In the Kyrie/Kemba comparison, both have negative efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a negative subtraction so you actually want less of them.   Kyrie Irving = -21  Kemba Walker = -17  -17 &gt; - 21  It's basic number line math. More negatives is not more good. A guy scoring poorly isn't helping you by scoring even more poorly.   Another example is Carmelo Anthony. Would you rather have Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a star or Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a role player?  At this point in his career, Carmelo Anthony trying to score 20ppg is detrimental to his team, he's better off scoring in a limited capacity and letting other guys take the shots instead.  &gt; so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans.  And for all intents and purposes, when Kyrie was sucking ass through a straw he tried to be the hero and got in everyone's way. When Kemba was sucking ass through a straw he let the Jays take over as the #1 and #2 options."
"Basically this argument is that volume doesnt matter at all. Would you rather have Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  Not to mention, like I said earlier, scoring is less efficient on average in the playoffs than in the regular season so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans."
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that’s an opinion."
"If Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant come back in time for the playoffs, Warriors could have a shot."
Didn’t Bron and the Cavs have Draymond crying in parking lot for Kevin Durant to come join them? Also how many championships does your franchise have?
This man must not know about Kevin Durant. Do you know who he is?
Kevin Durant is the Thunder franchise GOAT. Come on man.
"good points, but ultimately the fact he is playing with Kevin fucking durant will really be a disadvantage to his case  but your banking all of this on a couple things  1. that they get the first seed 2. that KD and Kyrie continuously sit out  even with all of that which is kinda unlikely embiid as a second seed will probably be ranked higher, at this point it is all speculation but thanks for the discussion and sorry for assuming that you were being bias"
Terry Rozier over Kevin Durant. Maybe LaMelo over Giannis but it’s sorta a tossup.
"Kevin Durant is higher than Harden if you're counting the Nets. But given their star power, none of the Nets will get it.   LeBron or Embiid for me right now.  Lillard or Curry or Jokic ain't in the conversation till they become at least top 3 seed."
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Dončić  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
&gt; what about kevin fucking durant.  Don’t know where you were looking but absolutely no one forgot about KD.  I’m a Lakers fan so it’s AD I’m concerned with.
I heard so much “well if AD was playing things could be different” but what about kevin fucking durant. Wouldn’t he just cancel that out?
Russell Westbrook achieved far more in an OKC jersey than Kevin Durant did.
Kevin Durant is treated like he's basically a hair under LeBron and the undisputed second best player in the league.
Kevin Durant doesn’t qualify because of games played
Kevin Durant.
"cuz this net rating thing, is just a subjective advanced stat (some websites even measure it differently). It correlates very very strongly with team results. you can put Kevin Durant on worst team in the league and odds are that he will have negative net rating.   I will give you a few more players with negative net rating:  Zion Williamson (-0.6), Beal (-4.4), Demar (-1.1), Fox (-7.2), Vucevic (-8), Sga (-7), Bam (-0.9), Lavine (-1.5)  while we have such: DiVicenzo (+12.1), Royce Oneal (+11.3)   So basically, if your team is doing good - your net rating is probably good, if your team is doing bad - its probably bad. How much impact you had on team doing good/bad? debetable. but you cant make much argument that Divicenzo is better than guys listen above.  And in my opinion Pacers doing not so hot has a lot more to do with missing Warren Oladipo/Levert for so long + some role players for shorter period times (Turner, Mcconel, Lamb etc) than with Sabonis ""bad"" play."
"&gt; Giannis, like KD, is more of a really tall wing than an actual big  Giannis has consistently shot over 60% of his shots from the paint. Kevin Durant hovers around 27% most years. I would say Giannis is an actual big while Kevin Durant is a tall wing."
"Over 60% of Giannis's shots are from the paint and this has been the case every year he has played. On the [classic graphic](https://basketballphantom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Basketball-Positions.jpg) with the basketball court numbered 1-5 where the players play, a 4 and a 5 is under the basket. Even if you look at guards that dive to the basket a lot, I haven't found any that break 50% except for Dwayne Wade a couple years.  Giannis is 6'11"" and gets most of his buckets under the rim. To me he is a clear cut big (with a lot of talent and handling skills).  Kevin Durant hovers around 27% his percent of shots under the rim and I wouldn't call him a big but a pretty straight forward SF who just happens to be tall. Bigs nowadays aren't what they used to be 20 years ago. However I would argue the same thing is said about PG's where they score a lot more now. I would also say wing players must be able to shoot the three now which also wasn't the case in the past. Bigs have gone through an evolution, just like other positions have as well."
"Kevin Durant would have been my pick until they added James Harden, had Kevin played more consistently of course"
"You know what gets lots of guys into the hall? Winning championships.  Harden, in case you forgot, was on a team with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka - they even made it to the finals (the only time Harden's ever been).  The guys Harden keeps losing to? Yeah, it's the Warriors - including the Warriors beating him last season when Curry and Klay were out and Draymond led a team that was mostly rookies, two-ways, and 10-days past him on national television.  Harden played on teams good enough to win. If only Harden had actually won."
"Brick city tonight, but thank god we have the big 3 compliment on ~~Kevin Durant~~ BRUCE BROWN"
Kevin Durant is robin to bruce brown . James harden is Alfred and kyrie is a custodian
davis can get confused. he sometimes thinks he's kevin durant
"holy shit.  harden was out for the 1/3 of that last quarter and they just fucking dropped 42 like it was nothing.      It's hard to imagine how they could have done better than 75% shooting but I mean, Harden doesn't get into foul trouble, add Kevin Durant for 8 minutes in that quarter, and some pairing of Durant/Harden/Irving on the floor at all times.... Jesus christ could they have scored 60???"
Kevin Durant is in pretty good spot right now. There isn't an urgency to rush him so he can just focus on getting to 100%.
"I think guarding Harden and Kyrie should be manageable - it’s stopping fucking Kevin Durant which will the challenge. We have great defensive personnel, but I don’t think KD is someone you can really scheme for / stop consistently.   If the raptors do win a 7 game series against the nets, it’ll be because KD is out / playing poorly."
"Then by your logic, Kevin Durant shouldn't be an all-star let alone a starter and a captain no? He has played in 19 games so far out of the 32. That translates to 59.3%  Looks more like you are biased than following any kind of rulebook!"
Kevin Durant hitting a hesi pull up jimbo from the top of the key is literally orgasm inducing
Kevin Durant took over the league in 2016 and he will do it again in 2021. When you look at it. KD pretty much dictates the powershift in the NBA.
Kevin Durant? Chris Bosh?
"James Harden, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid are probably the names that come to my mind as far as having an arsenal of repeatable moves. there are other skilled players like Curry, LeMelo etc but they are skilled in a morr free flowing way as apposed to a set of moves that they stick to."
Of course not. He’d just pass that shit to Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant
"Right now? Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Zion Williamson are the ones that come to mind for me. Those are all guys who you can look at and go ""damn, how do you guard that??"" I *want* to put Giannis in that category, but teams seem to have figured out a pretty workable way to guard him, at least until someone on the Bucks coaching staff figures out that just because you *can* let him handle the ball every possession doesn't mean you *should.*"
So is Kevin Durant. Interesting.
"No, I said Harden can't win because his team is too stacked offensively. Part of that includes having Kevin Durant, the better player and more valuable player to the team on his team. You know this, don't be naive. So arguing Harden can win MVP as the less valuable player by comparing it to Lebron winning with Bosh is literally trying to say ""Lebron was worse than Bosh and he STILL won MVP on his stacked team!"" Thats a faulty example.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; If Harden doesn't clearly show he's the best of the Nets trio obviously he's not gonna get MVP consideration. But if he emerges as the alpha dog (remains yet to be seen if he will but his last week or so has hinted that it could be the case), the fact that he has a top 5 player teammate (KD/Wade) and a top 10-20 player teammate (Kyrie/Bosh) won't necessarily eliminate him from MVP consideration just like it didn't for LeBron in Miami.   I don't really have much to say to this. This is like saying Damian Lillard or Luka can win MVP or something. Like, yes its theoretically possible. Anything is possible. But this is about the chances of it happening. ""Likelihood of being MVP"" That's what I said. And besides, this is Durants team. Kyrie knows it, Harden knows it, Nash knows it, we all know it. Durant is here BECAUSE its his team, he's the alpha this time.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I'm not convinced Harden is a better player than Durant but that's not the argument you were making originally. If you said, ""you can't win an MVP when you're not even the best player on your own team,"" sure, I'd wholeheartedly agree.   I am convinced Durant is better than Harden and most are. And yes, that was my argument. If you didn't get ""Durant is on Hardens team"" when I said ""Hardens team is too insanely offensively stacked"" I'm sorry, but I feel like thats obvious enough."
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"I picked the 6 year stretch that Kevin Durant played in OKC on good teams, omitting his first playoff run to account for inexperience and youth. I used LeBron James' most recent 6 year stretch. What's the issue here?"
"Kevin Durant in the postseason from 2011-2016:   - 26.9 points per-75 possessions, 58.0% TS (46.3% FG, 33.2% 3PT)  LeBron James in the postseason from 2014-2020:   -  29.1 points per-100 possessions, 60.2% TS (52.2% FG, 34.8% 3PT)"
"Smh just sign Kevin Durant in free agency, how hard can it be"
7-footer who started his attacks from the perimeter and leveraged a deadly jump shot as his primary weapon? Sounds a lot like a prototype of Kevin Durant tbh
"Kevin Durant, guard him with someone smaller he will just shoot over them, put a big fella on him and KD is blowing by him to the rim  Dude just gets buckets however you wanna give it to him"
A contest isn’t really a contest when you’re Kevin Durant
"And they are all wrong Only 2011 can be argued and even then is still wrong.  2011- Lebron forms his BIG THREE with Wade and Bosh who at the Time were still Borderline All-Stars, and doesn't even finish Top in the East with the The Bulls entire Offense running through Rose who got them the First seed but sure debatable. He wasn't even Second Place lol  2014- NOT EVEN FUCKING CLOSE, Kevin Durant was on another Level this year and the Votes were not close, Russ was out for almost half the season and KD averaged 32 points and led OKC to the Second seed in the league all while having better Stats than Lebron it was a fucking Landslide and rightfully so  2015- Basically Lebron's Worst season since his rookie year, had comparable Stats to Steph, whose team had the best record in the league while Lebron wasn't even top in his own Conference. He wasn't even in the conversation it was between Steph &amp; Harden  2018- Lebron had worse stats than Harden who averaged 30 points led his team to the First seed in the West during the Time of the KD Warriors, Lol Lebron was fourth in East and he should've gotten MVP?, Harden took warriors to 7 game and came the closest to winning a Chip against a fully healthy KD warriors than Anyone else meanwhile Lebron got Swept in the Finals."
Yes I Kevin Durant am juiced. But I’m also just fuckin better
"There were always 2 issues with Kevin Durant's recovery from the Achilles:  1) Would he still be the same player? 2) Could he sustain his health long-term?  I'm pretty sure the first question has been answered with a resounding yes. But the second question still remains and I hope I'm wrong but the long-term health of Kevin Durant is the main issue as he continues his post Achilles career. I'll believe it when I see it, but I don't think KD can sustain playing all games in a post-season or even regularly playing in the regular-season. I hope I'm wrong, but that's just my gut feeling based on the foot injuries he's had over the years."
"“He's not historically dirty, it's just that any time anything like this comes up people choose to say ""well he's historically dirty so this thing that isn't a thing is somehow actually a thing for him."" Then all those incidents that aren't incidents pile up. Same thing they did for guys like Stephen Jackson.  Bev years ago dove for a ball and it hurt a guy. Kevin Durant famously made the same play the next night, arguably more dangerously, and it didn't injure anyone since that's all pure luck. But ever since that one incident any time Bev is judged it's in the harshest light, and that's how someone becomes ""historically dirty.""  Clipper fan."
Your franchise would have won a title since 2008 if it hadn't been stolen from the city of Seattle and relocated to the middle of nowhere. Imagine if Kevin Durant was a career supersonic.
Also OKC stole a Mavs assistant to Dirk's shooting coach who copied all the of Dirk's drills and introduced them to Kevin Durant.
"&gt; He's euro Kevin Durant with a little Arvydas in there too  I don't disagree with this, and this is a bit off-topic, but if you *really* want to see white kevin durant, i beg you to please go watch some Chet Holmgren highlights. ***That*** kid is the next KD. He is absolutely fucking *ridiculous*."
"I think Kevin Durant is the best all around scorer I’ve ever seen. MJ was obviously incredibly gifted in many aspects of the game. But I think his mentality and versatility are what make him (a) GOAT. Pure offense, one man vs. the bucket, on an average day - I’d go KD over Jordan too"
"He's euro Kevin Durant with a little Arvydas in there too, he really will be special if he pans out. He also seems to love the game and want to be in there, even if it's just 10 minutes now. I don't even know what his prime would look like but if he gets anywhere close to it he'll be a good player"
"&gt; The NBA was eager to capitalize on the excitement sur-rounding Linsanity, and adding Novak, who had never dunked in five seasons as a professional, was just another wrinkle to the theatrics. For a role player with a few mil-lion in career earnings, the cash incentive ($20,000 just for participating) wasn’t insignificant, and the potential spotlight could have done wonders for the Knicks forward. He had been lobbying the league to let him join the three-point shootout, but they preferred Kevin Durant. At 6' 10"", no player as tall as Novak has appeared in as many games without dunking. And he wasn’t about to risk becoming a meme at All-Star weekend."
"Damn I loved when he went ""I'm Kevin Durant... you all know who I am."""
I mean... He's Kevin Durant.
"Of course he would, but he’s better than James Harden. He just is. There’s no argument, guys can seriously halt Harden in the playoffs and prevent him from scoring at times. You can’t do that to Kevin Durant. He’s clear cut #2. Just stop. It’s LeBron, KD, then a conversation."
"Bro we get it, you’re on Harden’s nuts. You can talk your shit about Harden against almost any guy in the league, but God damn, Kevin Durant is not one of them."
"&gt;So using your logic James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Steph Curry arent perennial candidates either, AIGHT  All of these guys have more than 1 season getting first place votes. 2 of them literally won the award multiple times. Try again  What the fuck are you talking about."
"Being top 5 in MVP for multiple years means you're a perennial candidate.  So using your logic James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Steph Curry arent perennial candidates either, AIGHT"
Ray Allen and Kevin Durant have the best looking jumpers. My personal favorite is Carmelo Anthony jumpshot.
Kevin Durant James Harden Kyrie Irving DeAndre Jordan Joe Harris  Good luck scoring 90 without your starting 5
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12.

He’s playing with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving?
Yepp as a Sixers fan I love my team and Embiid is a monster but how do you guard Harden Kyrie and Kevin Durant lol
Lol imagine losing to a team missing Kevin Durant 💅💅💅
Idk how you can put the clippers over the nets when the nets just beat them without Kevin Durant.
salivating at what a fucking scary yet thrilling an nba finals series will be with the full Clippers squad against the full Nets squad. Kevin Durant in the Finals? I’m scared shitless
How is Kevin Durant an NBA player?
Kevin freaking Durant is in street clothes on the bench man 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
"Reminder, the nets are missing kevin fucking Durant lol they’re gonna won the chip."
Nets still don't have Kevin durant lmao  This team is so op
"Chris ""Kevin Durant"" Boucher"
Kevin Durant still alive too.
AND KEVIN DURANT ISNT EVEN PLAYING

"Fun fact. Kevin Durant, James Harden, AND Russell Westbrook have actually played together before, on the 2012 USA Basketball team."
Am I the only one who hates the was Kevin Durant plays? Like I hate how he ISO’s so many times even when others are open especially Curry on the three point line.   See how stupid that sounds? ISO players are necessary to win close games. I know y’all fantasize about the perfect passing system ala San Antonio but in reality that doesn’t work 100% of the time.
I'm no Yao Ming expert but he'd probably be barbecue chicken on defence. He wouldn't fit into the defensive scheme the Rockets employed against the Warriors at all because he was far too slow to be able to switch. Yao Ming on Steph Curry or Kevin Durant on the perimeter would be guaranteed points every time.
"People in this thread be like ""Easy, give me one of Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant"""

Kevin Durant and Brandon Roy😢
"Imagine thinking Luka Dončić was a top 5 player in the NBA and had GOAT potential because he won two games against the Los Angeles Clippers and lost in the first round lol. Couldn’t be me. Luka Dončić isn’t even a top 15 player in the NBA.   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Jaylen Brown are better."
Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet.
"1. Actually they aren’t rotating them on a substantial level,  as seen by the fact all 3 are playing a ridiculous 40+ minutes  2. Yea you kinda left out 1 little detail about Kyrie playing off ball in Cleveland: they didn’t have a kevin Durant. In your comparison,  the co on-ball presence (Lebron) is harden. So while Kyrie and Bron could just take turns scoring all game, Kyrie and harden can’t do that. Which brings it back to my point about diminishing returns...  3. As you just explained Harden is on ball. But he’s not just on ball and able to do his thing, he has to get the ball to Kyrie AND KD. So he’s more of a traditional PG. So as PG that means he’s not averaging 30, 35 like he normally does. And if he’s not averaging 30-35, well then he ain’t “James Harden”.  Perfect example is Chris Bosh and Kevin love.  Both still good players obviously, but Bosh became a percentage of what he was before (they won a title with him scoring 1 point in a clinching game), and Love at the end became a straight up role player."
"Because they have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving."
Blake is nowhere near Malone. Of course Stockton is gonna win more if he plays with one of the best players ever. It's the same thing with Westbrook of course Westbrook is gonna win more when he plays with Kevin Durant.  You're comparing one player who was pretty much never the best on his team to one who was the best player by far for 90% of his career.
"I'd say Jokic is a better passer which is huge praise in itself. He's the only player in the world that has no discernable flaw on offense, other than LeBron, and he does it as a 5 which creates a matchup nightmare for every team in the league. The best player he's ever played with is a borderline all star and he led a 3-1 comeback against arguably a title favourite. Give Jokic a Pascal Siakam or Bradley Beal type player and he could average a triple double on a championship team. LeBron is top 3 at the absolute worst all time but in 2021 Big Honey has it all.  As for Giannis, he reminds me a lot of young LeBron. If you can't knock down your free throws and if you can't score at 3 levels, you can't be the best player in the world.  I think that LeBron, Jokic, Kevin Durant, AD Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry have an argument for being the best player in the world. Doncic is knocking on the door. Everyone else either has a major flaw (Giannis, Harden) or is just not as good as someone else who does the same thing (Lillard [Curry] , Embiid [AD] )."
kevin durant imo

"They basically have the most creative offense in the league, they can score however they want and make any kind of plays. On defense they're ok. Kyrie is an overhated defender, he can be solid if there's a need for it. Harden can be a great defender, especially in the post, if he wants to. Kevin Durant is a solid defender, due to his length and agility he can contest shots well, get blocks."

"It's hard to overstate how uniquely gifted Kevin Durant is.  There's never been a player with his combination of size, length, coordination, and skill in the history of the NBA.  Players who have his size and length are usually far less coordinated and skilled.  Players who have his coordination and skills are usually much smaller."

"Bucks? I’m sorry but why the bucks? Cause of Giannis? Ok how are the bucks going to guard Kyrie, James fkin Harden and Kevin fucking Durant???"
Isn’t it obvious? Most people are in their feelings. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship. LeBron James and Anthony Davis witnessed first hand  the monster Kevin Durant is in the playoffs.
Wardell Stephen Curry II doesn’t have an argument that he was better than Kevin Durant in 2017 or 2018. You don’t take a backseat to a player that isn’t better than you.   Considering Wardell Stephen Curry II as the second best player of the 2010s and Wardell Stephen Curry II being better than Kevin Durant when they were both on the Golden State Warriors are the most embarrassing takes on r/NBA.
I hope he fixes his shit and averages at least 10 a game... Points I mean not the other stuff. There's no reason for his shot to have regressed so badly. I mean I get there were the Durant years and Kevin Hart took his soul but cmon...
"Since I followed the NBA in the 2001-02 season, none of them.  Let's take a list in order: Tim Duncan 2 straight years, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash 2 straight years, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James 2 straight years, Derrick Rose, Lebron James 2 straight years, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry 2 straight years, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokuompo 2 straight years.  Not one time did I feel anyone else should have been MVP over them."
"He's Kevin Durant, y'all know who he is"

Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. The sorriest franchise in sports would’ve never won a championship if Kevin Durant didn’t get injured.
"One thing no one has mentioned yet is that Kevin Durant had a lot more time than other players to recover. He basically had nearly 2 years to recover and rehab. The injury is not as big as a problem as the timeline, especially in a time sensitive business like the NBA"
I hear this Kevin Durant fellow doesn't provide too much offense.
"Couldn’t be Kyrie Irving. Kyrie Irving doesn’t care about individual awards. He’s a champion and winner.   I’m so happy to have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving on the Brooklyn Nets. They care more about their team and winning."

"The Brooklyn Nets Big 3 is the greatest trio of all time. Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving is just unfair."

Kevin Durant should be the favorite to win MVP. Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. James Harden will lead the Brooklyn Nets in assists after the Oklahoma City Thunder game. Only way Kevin Durant doesn’t win MVP is because the media still hates him.
Kevin Durant is not going to win MVP and a championship this year. Kevin Durant is 1-7 in his last 8 games played. The Brooklyn Nets will finish with a bottom 2 record in the East. The Brooklyn Nets will never win the NBA championship.
Kevin Durant is going to win MVP and a championship this year. Kevin Durant is 7-1 in his last 8 games played. The Brooklyn Nets will finish with a top 2 record in the East. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship.

"In 2018 'the help' didn't get hurt until the WCF against the Warriors. In the 2 series prior Harden averaged 28.5 on 40.7/34.4/88.9 splits.  Kevin Durant has averaged 29.3 ppg on 48.0/35.5/86.4 splits **over his last 8 straight playoff appearances.**   So yeah Harden has a regular season case, but there is pretty much no way to argue he's been better in the playoffs than KD."

So Kevin Durant is being used as a role player now? Why is he getting a touch every 6 plays?
Kevin. Durant.
"If some people were wondering about the presence of outliers, I've created a sorted table using interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of consistency.    |**Rk**|**PLAYER**|**TEAM**|**PPG**|**PPG SDev**|**PPG IQR**| --:|:--|:--|--:|:--|:--| |12|Jayson Tatum|BOS|26.6|±6.3|±6.0| |22|Christian Wood|HOU|23.5|±4.0|±6.0| |18|Jerami Grant|DET|24.3|±6.3|±6.0| |16|LeBron James|LAL|25.2|±6.8|±6.75| |2|Kevin Durant|BKN|30.4|±5.9|±7.0| |17|Collin Sexton|CLE|24.8|±7.5|±7.5| |11|CJ McCollum|POR|26.7|±7.4|±8.0| |21|Paul George|LAC|23.9|±6.8|±8.5| |1|Bradley Beal|WAS|34.4|±9.1|±8.75| |25|Donovan Mitchell|UTA|23.4|±6.7|±9.0| |22|Nikola Vucevic|ORL|23.5|±7.7|±9.8| |14|Kawhi Leonard|LAC|25.9|±6.1|±10.0| |15|Nikola Jokic|DEN|25.4|±6.7|±10.5| |24|Zion Williamson|NOP|23.4|±7.5|±10.8| |7|Jaylen Brown|BOS|27.3|±7.4|±11.5| |9|Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|27|±8.4|±12.0| |3|Damian Lillard|POR|28.7|±8.9|±13.5| |7|Luka Doncic|DAL|27.3|±8.5|±13.8| |9|Zach LaVine|CHI|27|±9.5|±14.5| |4|Stephen Curry|GSW|28.4|±11.7|±15.5| |20|James Harden|BKN|24|±11.5|±17.5| |19|Gordon Hayward|CHA|24.1|±10.0|±18.0| |5|Kyrie Irving|BKN|28.1|±7.3|±18.3| |6|Joel Embiid|PHI|27.7|±10.7|±18.3| |13|Trae Young|ATL|26.1|±11.5|±19.8|  What is interesting to note is the prevalence of high volume three point shooters at the bottom (LaVine, Curry, Harden, Irving, Young).  As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."

"Clearly, you’ve been sleeping under a rock because the NBA announced two years ago that they recognized the inconsistency with their measurements and are going to start providing real player heights in socks with updated measurements.   An NBA employee lined up Kevin Durant and measured him from head to toe with a measuring tape. Yet here you are trying to argue that a single Tim Duncan case from 20 years ago invalidates this fact"
"No.  The baseball hall has only ever really blackballed players who did some pretty bad things.  Like the Pete Rose betting scandal and the poster boys for the steroid era.    Curt Schilling was a very borderline case even without the recent internet outbursts.  He probably *should* be in based on his career alone, but it's not a slam dunk, and thus he's a case where the voters do have some leeway and chose to use it.  If Schilling was Kevin Durant caliber with 10x All-Stars, an MVP, and undeniable place as one of the top 5 players in the sport for his generation, then Schilling would be in the Hall easily even with his loud mouth."
"It'll depend from person to person. On paper, Kevin Durant is easily a Top 11-15 player. If he won another FMVP, surely he'd be a Top 10 player... depending on how you feel about his Warriors stint. If you feel that those rings ""don't count"", another FMVP might bring him to your personal 11-15 (and that's assuming you're not the kind of person that sees the Nets in a similar situation). Overall, Kevin Durant is arguably one of the best of all time but there's always going to be a little scrutiny against him.  Steph on the other hand is easily the second greatest point guard of all time, and to me that puts him in that 11-15 slot regardless of who you are or how you view him. Another MVP or even his first FMVP would squarely put him up with the eleven or twelve ""top 10"" basketball players."

Brooklyn Nets vs Los Angeles Lakers   I want to watch Kevin Durant sweep LeBron James in the NBA Finals again. I just hope the Los Angeles Clippers don’t make the Finals.
I mean every big 3 that's formed before this one has had the third guy sacrifice a lot of their shots. Kevin Love was averaging around 20 shots a game prior to Cleveland and started averaging 13 or 14 a game with them. Ray Allen was averaging around 20 shots a game in Seattle then about 13 or 14 with Boston. Both was averaging about 17 shots a game in Toronto then went down 12-14 during the Bron heat years while wade went from 20 shots a game to about 17. The absolute best case scenario was golden state where instead of Klay sacrificing shots both Durant and Curry sacrificed a little from their shot total.  Basically if go off of history Harden's taking the amount of shots you'd expect a 3rd option on a big 3 team to take. They can try to figure things out and get him more shots. However both Kyrie and KD have already gotten mad when they felt they weren't getting enough shot attempts in the past.
"When you're as top heavy as the nets, you could use a Kevin Durant"
"*A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below.*  ----  I might be alone here, but imo Shaq was trying to do something similar to Kobe's tweet challenges. He just did it in a macho/tough love/awkward way, and on live TV. But I think he was romanticizing and thinking he could say that and then Donovan would take it personally or say ""challenge accepted"" and then go crazy and then Shaq would feel like he was on the same shit Kobe was on in terms of mentoring/inspiring the new generations.  All speculation, but I think maybe this was a step away from his hating and petty past, and an attempt to start being more of a tough love older brother/mentor.

He just decided to turn into Kevin Durant from mid range this year also as a bonus  51% from 10-22 feet sample size is for nerds
Kevin Durant is who Kyrie thinks he is
I wanna be Kevin Durant when I grow up

Kevin Durant Or James Harden PnR
"&gt; I never lied you idiot. The Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records. So easily debunked huh? Apparently not, because clearly you had no fucking idea.  You 100% are lying. I literally looked at the NBA attendence rankings and I provided you the highest average attendence for VC and Lowry+DeRozan, which one was higher? Lowry and DeRozans. It is actually the highest average attendence in Raptors franchise history. What was that about not setting attendence records?  You also claim the Raptors struggled in their early years. Simply not true.  Here are try Raptors average attendence for each season from the inaugural thru Vince Carters last full season with us.  Season | Rank | AVG :--|:--:|--: 95-96 | 3 | 23,178 96-97 | 8 | 18,266 97-98 | 18 | 16,468 98-99 (VC Drafted + ACC opening) | 10 | 17,567 99-00 | 9 | 18,451 00-01 | 6 | 19,347 01-02 | 4 | 19,783 02-03 | 10 | 18,963 03-04 | 8 | 18,307  Outside of a single outlier in 97-98, attendance has been stable before, during and after Vince Carter. The Raptors didn't struggle with attendence in our early years. We also didn't even set league attendence records, we were 10th in attendance during his rookie season. In the 1st and 2nd season of the Raptors existence we were 3rd and 8th.  &gt; I never said he was making HOF solely because of his raptors career. Hes making it because he's an icon of basketball and that started at Toronto, vinsanity was Toronto and Toronto basketball started with Vince Carter.  Toronto Basketball started with Mighty Mouse Damon Stoudemire, not Vince Carter. For someone who acts like they know so much about the Raptors, it's odd you forgot about Mighty Mouse, someone that fans haven't forgotten nor has the franchise.  And as a Raptor, he has been long surpassed by Lowry and DeMar. What VC did after leaving the Raptors strengthens his hall of fame case especially with his longevity and his willingness to take a step back, something other star players have has trouble with as well so hats off for VC for that. But he is not the greatest or second greatest Raptor.  &gt; Hawks supporter* NBA fan. Imagine thinking because you support a team it means you know nothing about the rest of the NBA...  Hawks fan who doesn't know nothing bout the Raptors or basic attendence figures*  &gt; Clearly you're just butthurt because Vince wanted out after putting the raptors on the map and not getting any supporting cast until it was too late.  Actually, I'm not. I actually think Vince Carter should get his jersey retired by us (after Lowry and DeRozan) and regularly go back and forth with other Raptors fans about it. Vince Carter got fucked over by how trash our ownership and front office was (and so was Chris Bosh). I have no issue with Vince Carter leaving and I understand why he would want to leave. I have no issue with Bosh, Kawhi, Mighty Mouse, Canby and McGrady but the issue I have with VC is how he went about it. He basically pulled a Harden except he added on just completely not giving a fuck on the court basically just purposefully playing beneath himself to hurt the team. There was also talk of him telling opposing teams our plays, not sure if it is true or just a rumour, but it matches up with how he was actually playing on the court.  &gt; Even kawhi and Bosh didn't want to stay in Toronto. Maybe if you idiots actually had an eye for greatness you'd retain actual *great* players. Peak Lowry and Peak Derozan don't even come close to peak VC.  Are we talking about Greatest Raptors or Best Raptors? Cause you do know there is a difference right? Kawhi is the single best player to wear a Raptors uniform. But he isn't the greatest, he doesn't have the longevity nor accomplishments to hold that title, Lowry does. What you seem to be arguing is, LeBron is the greatest Laker because he is the best player to ever put on the Lakers Purple And Gold over Kobe/Magic, or that Kevin Durant is the greatest Net of all time cause he is a better player than Dr. J. Or that LeBron is the greatest Heat player cause he is the best player to wear the jersey even though we all know the greatest Heat is D Wade.  Also, you're a Hawks fan. Get a chip in the modern era before talking about retaining great players. Maybe if idiots such as you weren't Hawks fans or stopped being idiots who don't understand the difference between greatest and best or basic attendence figures maybe y'all will do something with Trae instead of wasting him away like you've done with Hawks stars of the past."
"man, the refs do not like kevin durant.  second missed call against him.  the call the nets challenge removes a foul for durant but the heat still scored.  this would have removed a foul and given the nets 3 points."

*I think Kevin Durant is a great scorer.*  \- Magic pro scouting
Kevin “Javale Mcgee” Durant
Bad pass? End of clock? Hand in your face? Doesn't fucking matter when you are Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant would be a better question. I think Durant overtakes Larry when he retires.   https://www.landofbasketball.com/player_comparison/larry_bird_vs_kobe_bryant.htm
One washed DeAndre Jordan as your only real center and no Kevin Durant.
"Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Why not? I bet my life Sean Mark's is gauging the market. You dont turn down the chance to add James Harden to Kevin Durant. That doesnt mean your roster might not need to be tweaked afterwards. There are obvious weaknesses and imbalances with this trio.
James Harden + Kevin Durant
"Yeah these super-teams usually take some time to get it together. The Big 3 Heat started off 9-8 also. Hell, the Warriors with Steph, Klay, Draymond and Kevin Durant lost their first game by 29 points."
Kevin Durant TS% hovers around .64-.65% the last couple of seasons while hardens is around .62-.63% he is not that more efficient and as scoring 4-5 points less a game. This is also in offenses that harden has to carry as the lone offensive threat while KD could stand around on GS and only take the most perfect shots while Curry and Thompson went of for 50+ on any given night.
The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the championship. I want to watch Kevin Durant sweep LeBron James in the Finals again.
Your basketball team is worse off if Kevin Durant gets injured.
"Really sad to see the downfall of these once great veteran players, here is a stat that will shock you, Both Kevin Love and Kevin Durant scored ZERO points tonight."
nice try kevin durant
And Kevin Durant is 100x better than whoever the 2nd option on the Cavs was that year.
Kevin Durant is bitch made tho
How do you score 19 with no Kevin Durant
"not exactly because hes only really creating shots for himself. it takes shooting an ungodly percentage from midrange to make up for the inherent difficiencies with that type of playstyle. kevin durant and the dubs had similar problems (tho not anywhere near to the same extent) in golden state, where kd would often get lost hunting his own shot on middys, and even when he was shooting well the offense could get real stagnant and struggle to score. instead, theyd look better with curry running things a lotta time  but anyways, thats not their biggest problem. their defense is garbage. they have 0 rim protection. deandre jordan fucking sucks"
Bruh I would bet anything in the world that the nets make the playoffs. They have kevin Durant for gods sake. It’s two games of a basically newly constructed team. Ppl gotta chill.
"isaac okoro! although his advanced stats are horrible, his disruption of passing lanes and lock down defense passes the eye test 100% and coaches are noticing it. man just locked down james harden and kevin durant several times in 2 games"

I’m from r/soccer and what Kevin Durant  said can be applied to every fucking sport
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving trading secret hesi techniques during practice.
"Without a doubt Lebron takes it. Lebron is simply just better. Kevin durant is a great player and when he retires will probably be a top 10 maybe top 15 player. However, Lebron has had incredible defense for most of his career and changes the game more. Durant is a better isolation scorer but if you had to put one on a team then Lebron will carry you further."
You misspelled Kevin Durant on team A
"They hired him [because KD loved him.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-raves-about-steve-nash-hire-every-time-im-in-the-gym-with-him-i-was-always-like-a-sponge/)   Like I said, the Nets were giving these guys a lot of freedom and kind of a 'blank check' of, '*hey we'll do what you're into.'*"
imagine thinking kevin durant assembled the warriors teams
Kevin Durant - 1  ScarJo and her bath water - 0
"&gt; Don't care about formatting  I wasn't trying to be a dick, it just makes your comment almost impossible to read. If you want your idea to be legible then use proper formatting lol.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html#all_shooting  KD is a career 38% shooter, but his highest percentage is from the farthest distance at 44%. 51% from the farthest tracked distance this year with Brooklyn. Why? Because he can shoot from anywhere. Why doesn't he have the volume from that distance as Steph? Because Steph can't pull up over anybody at the free throw line. Why in a professional basketball game would you shoot from 40 ft when you can just shoot over the top of anybody? You wouldn't. I'm not arguing that Kevin Durant shoots as often from range as Steph, I'm saying he can. And he can.   &gt;  I have a perfect set of eyes and KD isn't a long-range shooter, unless you have numbers to prove otherwise.   You have no number on KD shooting. Just one article that rightly talks about how good of a shooter Steph is. If you don't think that KD can shoot from range that's fine. It's just a really bad take that isn't supported by watching him play lol."
"Win a playoff semi finalsThe Oklahoma City thunder in the finals against the golden state warriors, they were up 3-1 and Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had horrible games which caused them to lose to the golden state warriors , then continued to lose the whole series 4-3. Pretty disappointing as a thunder fan during those years."
Kevin Durant absolutely ruined the competitive balance of the league when he blew a 3-1 lead and joined a 73-9 team.
"Hypothetically, if the Knicks were down down to Kevin Durant 3-1 in a series and then ended up winning 4-3, he would probably join them next year."
"Nets already Ballin on offense  Announcer - "" now here comes Kevin Durant off the bench """
Maybe KD was trying to iso too much but it’s still  Kevin Durant lol even the threat of him touching the ball freed up enough room for Curry Klay Dray etc   The Rockets were literally built to counter the 2016 Warriors with their switching defense vs the Warriors motion offense. KD’s gravity made that much tougher
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
No way Kevin Wayne Durant made your offence worse man cmon
dawg it’s kevin durant
"Only to get dicked down by Kevin Durant in the playoffs. Our of the entire west, I think the Cavs matched up worst with the Spurs that year"
"Ben Taylor's list is a career value list, not who was actually the best player while taking into account their careers, which is why it can end with a whack result where Jordan is at No.3 (which is asinine in itself), Larry Bird at 11th and Steve Nash ahead of guys like Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Dwyane Wade.  I respect Ben Taylor for following a criteria through his entire list, but if your criteria gets you Steve Nash ahead of Steph and KD and Michael Jordan at No.3, then your criteria was useless to begin with."
"Kevin Durant, Mike Conley join Kobe Bryant as NBA Oscar winners after 'Two Distant Strangers' takes Best Short  From CBS sports app. Apparently the Oscars going on"
Surprised Kevin Durant hasn’t been mentioned as much here.
Kevin Wayne Durant decided to start playing “for real”
Not when you have the top 1 iso player on your team. Plus some guy named Kevin Durant too.
&gt; He was never in the convo lol  Someone wasn't watching during the 2017-2018 season  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy  https://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/5042/kevin-durants-improvements-earn-defensive-player-of-the-year-shine-with-stein  https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/kevin-durants-defensive-player-year-campaign-picking-steam-213340705.html  Lemme know when Harden ever gets this kind of defensive praise
"Says the Rucker Park announcer, who is not actually kevin durant"
&gt; Kevin Durant says the team wants to have a white version of the City Edition jerseys that are inspired by the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Bruh don't make me like the Nets like that
"Y'all know who he is, he is Kevin Durant. In seriousness though, KD has missed a third of the season, played 28 minutes and still made everyone look like they shouldn't even be in the same court as he is.  KD gets hated for his decisions and internet antics, but only a healthy LeBron James has been able to consistently see eye to eye with him in big games. This dude has a shot to become a Top 10 player of all time this year with a championship and that's insane to me considering how much i respect Hakeem Olajuwon."
"""I don't think you have the facilities for that big man""  -Kevin ""Big Shaq"" Durant"
"“I’m Kevin Durant, y’all know who I am”"
"Harden averages 22.9 points per game in his playoff career, which ranks ninth among active players behind Kevin Durant (29.1 PPG), LeBron James (28.9 PPG), Stephen Curry (26.5 PPG), Russell Westbrook (25.4 PPG), Damian Lillard (24.8 PPG), Carmelo Anthony (24.5 PPG), Kyrie Irving (23.5 PPG) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.0 PPG).

"Fun fact: 538 player rankings dont account for injuries so it thinks kyrie and kd were bums last year lol  kevin durant is projected as a [""key role player""](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/kevin-durant/)"
Kevin durant is so special. Gonna take more time out of my day to appreciate his play
I. AM. KEVIN DURANT. I. AM. THE BEST.
Because he’s Kevin Durant?
"On Kevin Durant not suffering from rust after returning from injury: ""I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am."" - Kevin Durant."
"No, literally no reasonable person has said Kevin Durants entire FMVP case was predicated on the fact that more defensive attention went to Steph. All GSW fans say he played elite. In fact, nobody even argues against Durants 2017 FMVP so it's not ""won FMVPs."" People argue Steph deserved it in 2018, not that Durant didn't deserve it."
I mean no… he’s Kevin Durant
Op is talking about Kevin Durant not Julius Randle
"Man, this Kevin Durant guy seems like he could be big for los Nets"
Kyrie Durant and Kevin Irving
Kevin Durant could miss 3 seasons and still drop 30 his first game back
"""Yeah, two teams played, but only one of them has Kevin Durant, so that's the only team that matters. Speaking of Kevin Durant, did you see that incredible, once in a lifetime, never before seen regular floater from Kevin Durant? Incredible that such a thing could ever happen."" - Doris Burke, probably.  We played well for I'd say two, two and a half quarters. CP3 was off, and it wasn't a good game to be off. Booker played well for the first time in awhile, and I'll never understand why we stop going to Ayton after he's proven to be nearly unstoppable down low. And... Well, I won't complain anymore, but this game was frustrating to watch for many reasons.  GG Brooklyn. I don't like KD, but I like seeing healthy players, so happy he is back. Sucks that we snapped our streak of not losing back to back games, but at least it happened to good teams on a very difficult stretch of games. Losing to the Celtics (on a back to back) and then to the Nets isn't the worst thing to happen all season."
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
"You play well all season during the regular season, and then you wake up and the other team has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it doesn’t matter anymore."
"You play well all season during the regular season, and then you wake up and the other team has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it doesn’t matter anymore."
"You play well all season during the regular season, and then you wake up and the other team has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it doesn’t matter anymore."
Kevin Durant is so fucking good.
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
"You play well all season during the regular season, and then you wake up and the other team has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it doesn’t matter anymore."
Today I hate to love Kevin Durant.
Kevin. Durant. You know who I am
This is why that KD “I’m Kevin Durant” quote is so iconic. People do seem to constantly forget how good he is
it’s tough to keep faith when i watch kevin durant play for brooklyn
What is Kevin Durant?
kevin durant
Most years you don’t have kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
Because he is Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant had a huge impact on the way big men played basketball. He expanded on Dirk’s shooting impact by adding ball handling as a 7 footer. You can tell by the way young players talk about him just how much he radicalized that position. Big men being primary ball handlers is in large part because of Durant’s prowess.
he had 17 points in 19 mins on 100/100/100 splits his first game back after missing 2 months with a hamstring injury  He’s just Kevin Durant
every kevin durant bucket is a victory for posters everywhere
Kevin Durant the type of dude to break up via Twitter
Wher s kevin durant mang
"You realize they were traded over a year after Kyrie Irving and Kevin fucking Durant CHOSE to go there, right?"
Kevin Durant. Before him 7 footers weren’t shooting threes or isolating from the perimeter.
"It's actually a matter of numbers. If a player takes less than multiple other teams offered him, or they sign a max contract when they otherwise couldn't, that's circumventing the intended rules.  When you said ""assembling a championship roster is not hardly circumventing any rules,"" you just completely misquoted what I said, which is that *going around the salary cap* is the rule that's being circumvented, not trying to win. That's called a strawman argument and it's not a good thing to do.  Lastly, the ""sacrificing money for happiness,"" in this circumstance, also harms the happiness of the other players who follow the spirit of the rules and the happiness of the fans who don't get a competitive product, and, according to the players who do it themselves, actually doesn't even make them happy, since they get huge backlash for messing up the league. Look at Kevin Durant. And Dwyane Wade said the Heat didn't enjoy being hated either."
"I mean the high profile FAs you’re taking about were Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I love Randle and given his age and contract I do think he’s ultimately a better signing for the Knicks than Durant or Kyrie, but he’s not better than either of them."
"When you are comparing two guys of this stature, stats this shallow are kind of pointless. Talk about what they actually do that makes them great, then bringing in specific advanced stats that demonstrate it.   For example, you cite Steph's ""superior playmaking"", without account for position. Kd is a better playmaker vs. Other players at his position than Steph. If I play KD, I get to play a point guard alongside him who might be playmaker. If I play Steph, he is my point guard and I might not have playmaker to put around him as easily.   Kevin Durant is the greater player for his career. GM's would take prime KD over prime Curry. He plays a much shallower position, a more important position, and has (had?) much more defensive impact."
Honestly at this point Kevin Durant could cut himself shaving and the nets would hold him out 3 games
"Here is what a PF looks like in 2021: Anunoby, Tatum, Maxi Kleiber, Aaron Gordon, Kevin Durant.   We're not talking Otis Thorpe here. Simmons (6'10"") is clearly better equipped to chase these guys around."
"First of all, win one first.   Second, KD isn't getting remembered as a Net. There's nothing he can do in Brooklyn that will make that the first image that comes to mind as a basketball fan, and you're being insanely biased if you think the first image that will ever come to mind is #7 Kevin Durant.  You're talking about if he wins two in a row as if he didn't already win two in a row lol.   It would add to his personal legacy to bring a ring to a team that has none, obviously.  But that's different from the city's legacy.  How the Nets are interpreted by national media and how they're interpreted by NY are two different things."
"There's this really unique moniker given to kevin durant, something to do with serpents"
Why settle for Klay Thompson when you can get Kevin Durant.  He's got the ceiling for something like a KD lite if he works on those handles
"It's beyond the *rules.* Not just good players. Literally circumventing the intended rules of team-building.  The Lakers with Malone and Gary Payton were indeed a superteam because Malon and Payton signed for far less than they were worth. As were the 2011-14 Heat and Kevin Durant Warriors since both involved colluding to take less money or salary cap glitches. But just making voluntary trades, like the Celtics did in 2007, is not a superteam."
Kevin Durant /  Russell Westbrook
&gt;How can anyone look at these and not think Steph Curry is the better player/higher than Kevin Wayne Durant All Time?  Because you're looking at a small sample of their entire careers.
"That's not what a superteam is. A superteam is a team that's built beyond the intended rules of the league. That's what the prefix super- means, beyond what's supposed to be. In this case, by guys taking less money than they're worth or salary cap glitches. That's how Lebron, Wade and Bosh ended up on the Heat and how Kevin Durant was able to sign with the Warriors (raise in cap allowed a 73-win team with 3 All-Stars to have a max slot)."
Kevin Durant tweet lol
Kevin Durant
Look I get it. You want to think the Bucks have a chance. But they dont. Just accept it.          Kevin Durant and James Harden are greatness personified. Giannis is simply not good enough. Bucks are not serious contenders so please save the delusion
"I love how Thunder fans are the battered wives of the NBA.   A decade ago, their franchise had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook.  Their brilliant front office loses Harden then Durant.   The Thunder fans are left with the very least of the three.  Yet here they still are, defending Russell like hes going to come back to them and once again lead them to a sixth seed and first round exit.  Russell Westbrook is incapable of playing with another great player and making them better.  Just ask Paul George, or Kevin Durant or James Harden.     I guess you weren't a fan of the Thunder way back in 2019.  You should look up Oklahoma City and their lone playoff series from that year.  You can tell me some more about Westbrook being better than Lillard."
You're out of your fucking mind if you would pick julius over kevin Durant.
Pulled a Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant walked out on the Thunder at age 27 after a finals appearance and one loss to the Warriors. At the same age, Jordan had lost to the Pistons three times in a row and never appeared in the finals. He stayed with the Bulls."
You’re either a little kid. Or Kevin Durant on a burner.
"Its a three-way tie between Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler, and Kelly Oubre Jr."
Kevin Durant
"An amazing moment in NBA history. Once Kevin Durant said fuck it and just pulled up from deep to win the game, you just knew Steph Curry was going to join Oklahoma City because he needed to play with another MVP and 3 other Allstars to win anything."
Reminds me on how much I hate Kevin Durant now
Sorry if my original post seemed like I was slandering but I also adore Bam. I like the heat in general.  With Bam the Dude could really BE something If he just realized this is his moment to actually play with some aggression. Getting 3 boards tonight is pretty unacceptable. He should honestly be pretty ashamed. I just don’t want us to never get to see him at his best.  On defense he gets baited into switching every time because opposing offenses know hes a good switch defender. He should only be switching when it makes sense.  I wonder if he just has the Kevin Durant thing where since they have actual skills they don’t want to be big men
Are you Kevin Durant?
in a kevin durant mask
It's not just 2016. He was bad in 2014 against the Spurs and the Grizzlies in 2014. He would have gone down 3-1 against the 2014 Grizzlies in his MVP year if Reggie Jackson didn't score 30 points in game 4. He wasn't good either in 2013. His numbers in OKC is basically the same as James Harden on the Rockets in the playoffs and yet KD is treated like he's unguardable in the playoffs and Harden is a choke artist. This idea of Kevin Durant being unguardable is completely false. Kevin Durant being able to shoot over anyone is something that people romanticize about.
&gt;Kevin Durant has done more damage to his sport than any other athlete ever has  LMAOOOOO
The idea of Kevin Durant is better than what he is in real life
Kevin Durant has done more damage to his sport than any other athlete ever has and people let him get away with it because they have such an irrational hatred for LeBron. It's sick.
And that person roasting him is Kevin Durant in a mask

I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
Kevin Durant or Michael Che?
PG: Steph Curry   SG: Michael Jordan  PF: LeBron James  SF: Kevin Durant  C: Shaq
"you can only fail so much when you have Kevin Durant.   i don’t know how well these 3 will mesh, and i would def be worried about depth if i were a Nets fan. i don’t think they’ll win a championship but wouldn’t be stunned."
"&gt;“Well, but the only complaint that Kevin Durant had about Golden State was he wasn’t Steph Curry, and he never was gonna be Steph Curry in that market. And no matter what he did and how many championships they won, Steph Curry was still the guy.”  Warriors fans love Steph Curry not just for his skill but for his dedication to the team and organization. You don't earn that overnight. He won't have that in Brooklyn either. He will likely be the best player on any team he is on, but he will never be beloved like Steph is in the bay. He gave up his chance at that when he left OKC."
yeah it's even worse when you consider how his team doesn't exist anymore with kevin durant being one of only two players still in the league that used to play on that team
"Yep, they will most likely have success for sure, but there are way too many variables for the Nets.   * Traded away their bench and future for Harden * Kevin Durant is coming off a huge injury that leaves him susceptible to re-injury * Kyrie is a fucking moron * Harden until shaken, has a bad history with clashing with PGs * Nash is a rookie coach * Their big 3 are 32, 32 and 29 years old  Again, they will almost certainly be a contender, but anyone acting like they will be Title favorites for the next half decade a la Golden State are really simplifying it and underrating how well constructed the Warriors were."
"lol what kind of stupid are you?  You would bet EVERYTHING you own that a team with a prime Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving have no shot at coming close to winning a title?"
"&gt;taking one of the greatest teams of all time to 7 games  VERY easily the greatest team of all time.   Kevin Durant in the playoffs was about as good as Michael Jordan ever was in the playoffs, probably more efficient on lower volume, I actually haven't looked that up. Also had the two best shooters of all time. Also had elite team defense.   They would fucking crush any team to have ever played before them."
"&gt; Sure it's a lot of picks, but are we confident with what Houston's new FO is going to do with them? The fact that two best players the Nets traded away in the deal are both not with the Rockets makes it seem super weird to me. Is Oladipo even better than LaVert anymore? It's certainly a 50-50 debate in my eyes. And most people are saying Oladipo being an expiring was a cost cutting ownership move.  I'm willing to bet this is a Fertitta thing.  &gt; And Nets will most likely implode. And out of all teams, for the Nets to go all out giving away their future like this with such potential for disaster is just insane. Different ownership, different front office, different coaches and roster yet it's once again the Nets who gives the most amount of picks in the history of trades. How? How does it happen once again?  Let them play literally a single game before saying anything about what is ""likely"" going to happen, jesus christ.  The Nets acquired an all-time great player that perfectly aligns with the rest of KD's basketball career.  They are making a win-now move, that's the sort of move you make when you have a 32 year old Kevin Durant."
"Well that's just you being disingenuous IMO, his team was at a massive talent disadvantage, and the only reason they had a chance in that series was because of Harden, he was the only shot creator on that team once CP3 went down, and the other 2 team had 2 MVPs, and another 20+ PPG scorer in Klay, arguably the best 3rd option of all-time (well until now with this Nets team...).   Harden is just a worse version of LeBron. LeBron always lost to better teams, until he stacked the deck and made the best team and won championships. Even the Finals he's lost in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, he gets a pass for because again, he lost to better teams and nobody rightfully holds that against them because there's an acknowledgement of the talent disadvantage he was at.   KD lost to better teams in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016, until he stacked the deck in his favor and won championships.  You say LeBron took GS without Kyrie and Love to 6, and yeah, he did, but he didn't actually win that series and he was horribly inefficient. Does anybody *blame* him for that? No. Nobody sane does.   Harden took the 2019 Warriors to 6 with a decrepit Chris Paul who was useless for the first 5 games of that series, and yet somehow he gets blame for that? That series was INSANELY close, 2-2 after the first 4 games, with none of the games in that series being decided by more than 6 points. If you want to argue that he could've done better once KD went out, sure, but if anything that proves what every sane basketball fan believes, which is that Steph Curry &gt; James Harden. Klay Thompson was also a better #2 option than CP3 was at that time given his injuries, so again, he was at a talent disadvantage.   Point is, that Harden has never lost to any team where he was the favorite, where he had the better team. Now, you can argue that's what makes you a truly great player in this league.   However, has Kevin Durant done that before? Has Kawhi Leonard done that before?  Hell, has LeBron done that before?   It's really, really fucking hard to win a championship, which is why these superstars just stack the deck in their favor to try and increase the odds. The NBA has never been more like Game of Thrones than it is right now."
Kevin Durant never carried Russ. That’s just a fact.

"I know man but in this particular season, we have protocols in place. Those protocols alone will be the reason some players will miss games.  I’m saying, since he’s been gone, for whatever reason that is, he would have to go through COVID-19 protocol regardless of the reason.   Kevin Durant missed a couple of games this season because of the very same thing I’m talking about. Kyrie, since he was away from the team, would have to complete said protocol and be cleared to play.   That’s what I mean. And that’s what that article says.   The philosophy is he would not be able to play that specific game you were talking about for the reasons I just mentioned. It doesn’t matter whether he wanted to or not. Since he was away from the team, even if he disclosed those reasons, he would have to clear protocol which doesn’t happen quickly."
"Toronto fans gave a standing ovation to Kevin Durant getting injured against them in the Finals, if Kawhi was there for more than a year, choked in the playoffs every time, and then threw the rest of the team under the bus when things didn't go his way, I'm sure they'd have been bigger assholes when he left unceremoniously."
"I don't mean to be a dick, but where were you getting that stat of Shaq scoring over 29 points per 75 posessions on a +4% relative TS% in the playoffs? Because it appears to be wrong, and you've yet to post a link to it.  Shaq only got over 29 two times, in 1997 and 1998. And looking at the league average TS%, Shaq beat it by 1.6% in 1997 and 8% in 1998. So it looks like he only did this once in his entire career.  For comparison Jordan got over 29 points per 75 posessions in the playoffs a ridiculous 12 times, and was 4% better than the league average TS% an equally ridiculous 7 times.  Looks like LeBron got over 29 pts 4 times and 4% better TS 3 of those seasons. And those were all pre-Miami. In the seasons after he has around 8 near misses on the 29 pts, but on much better TS% and really high assist totals.  Kevin Durant got over 29 pts 2 times and was easily 4% better than the league average both times.  James Harden got over 29 pts 3 times and was 4% better once.  So even if you want to chuck out the regular season, Box Plus/Minus, Win Shares, RAPTOR, Offensive Rating and everything else in favor of this insanely narrow 29 points per 75 posessions on a 4% better relative TS%, it looks like Shaq only did it once, while Jordan did it 7 times, LeBron did it 3 times, and KD did it twice."
"&gt;""If I miss, it’s not my fault. It’s the environment. Or someone else’s fault.""   ~ Kevin Durant"
The Nets GM has an unhealthy relationship with risk smdh.  Brooklyn won the Kevin Durant lottery and then put every dime on a parlay with Irving/Harden/DJ.  I'll take the house on this one
"Yeah, because KD basically stopped trying to take shots towards the end of the season and the first few games of the series. The ""I'm Kevin Durant"" quote only came because he finally started being aggressive and take shots again."
"Lol people act like ISO ball is bad. The way the Rockets defended was to switch everything and contest passing lanes, that's why ISO ball was utilized so much. It's fucking Kevin Durant, there's nothing wrong with him taking an ISO."
He also said the Raptors were going to get Kevin Durant.
"Now no one else wants to say it...but fuck it, I will :  These guys that the Warriors currently have, just aren't as good as Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Don't really care how much this offends u"
"Bro, Harden played with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Westbrook again. CP3 got hurt at a bad time but come the fuck on. Stop pretending like he's never had quality teammates. His style of play just doesn't work in the playoffs. Selfish basketball doesn't win playoffs."
Can we please get Kevin Durant back?
"One thing I can be certain of is that neither Kevin Durant, James Harden, nor Kyrie Irving, give two turtleshits what any media member or fan has to say. These years of Brooklyn Nets hate posts that are coming, are unnecessary."
"Come on. The event was stupid, but Bosh is a class act, LeBron and Wade are meh, corporate guys, but they arent unlikeable.  This team has  Kevin Durant - Burner accounts, insecure, this latest kerr shit.  James Harden - Killed Houston with his demands then bounced in the most bizarre hold out ever. Floppingest flopper in the league  Kyrie..... The grand daddy most unlikeable shit stain in the league. What a fucking douchebag. Or i guess im just a pawn.    Fuck Brooklyn"
"seemed pretty obvious just watching it  kinda dumb too, you're fuckin Kevin Durant why would you care if people don't think you're better than LeBron  you were probably not but that's besides the point, kobe in his last season was probably not top 50 in the league but he sure as hell thought he was number one, KD has all the reasons in the world to not be insecure yet he is, will never understand that"
"The nephews got to hate someone, especially if it’s someone the caliber of a Kevin Durant."
"https://mobile.twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1337038330278649860  You did last month  If you can’t read the article: &gt;	Sources said the Rockets have no interest in a Nets offer, unless it would include either Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving."

Hey has anyone actually checked to make sure that actually *is* Chris Boucher and not just Kevin Durant wearing his face?
Little did we know Chris Boucher is actually the 2nd coming of Kevin Durant
"We gave him EVERYTHING he wanted, except for the people who didn’t want to play with him. Ironically - Kevin Durant."
"no, kevin durant is a top 10 player of all time. Harden is an all time great as well just no on the kd tier, it will be similar to when kd was in golden state, 2 top 5 players, but kd being the clear best player on the team. dude is just too good and hsi height makes it impossible to guard him, the midrange is also the most important shot in the playoffs and hes arguably the 2nd best midrange shooter ever."
Wait: Kevin Durant is Batman James Harden is Robin should not Kyrie Irving be Batgirl and Deandre Jordan Alfred.
"Wouldn't Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant be the butler?"
"I remember when KD signed there was a lot of people hoping it would fall apart. Y’all this is Kevin Durant and James Harden on the same team. Oh and Kyrie Irving. This is going to work just fine. They should cruise to the finals, and likely beat the Lakers or Clippers."
The Los Angeles Clippers are a better team than the Los Angeles Lakers.   As a Kevin Durant fan.... I want the Los Angeles Lakers to make the NBA Finals. LeBron James will have a 1-3 NBA Finals record against Kevin Durant.  Nets in 4.
The pick swaps are irrelevant for a team with James Harden and Kevin Durant...
"Since 2008 we've seen 6 or 7 out of 13 teams win a title that could be called superteams. Superteams being 2+ all stars being brought in via FA or trade and not homegrown or in Durant's case an MVP favorite joining a 73 win team with 3 all stars who just won a title.. 13/26 teams to make the finals in that span could be considered superteams  * 2008 Cetlics: KG and Allen join up with Pierce (3 all stars) * 2011-2014 Miami Heat: Chris Bosh and LeBron James join with Wade (3 all stars) * 2015-2017 Cleveland Caveliers: Kevin Love and LeBron James join Irving (3 all stars) * 2017-2019 Warriors: Durant and DeMarcus Cousins joins Steph, Klay, Draymond on a 73 win team (4-5 all stars) * 2020 Lakers: LeBron and Davis join the Lakers within one year of eachother. They didn't team up with an all star in LA, but you had 2 top 5ish players teaming up around the same time.  So while we only saw one true super super team (2017 Warriors) we've seen a lot more of all star caliber teammates joining forces and seeing success. Even teams like the LA Clippers, while not a conference or NBA champion, had two all NBA level guys agree to team up together and join during the same offseason. You also have Durant and Irving teaming up in Brooklyn and Harden forcing his way there.  Prior to 2008 there were not as many instances of all star teammates all joining up simultaneously for a chance to win a title. Sure you had your old vets who were ring chasing, or sometimes you had front offices making a blockbuster trade to acquire another star player (a la 2005 Miami getting Shaq to pair with Wade) but almost all of those instances had the team in question developing homegrown talent (Wade etc...) and then trading for a star to pair alongside. Not 2 or 3 teammates deciding to all meet up during the same offseason.  Prior we had seen the 2004 Lakers with an aged Payton and Malone join Kobe/Shaq. We saw an aging Charles Barkley join up with Clyde Drexler (who had joined the season prior) and Hakeem in Houston. In 1983 you had the Sixers and in '69 you had Wilt and Jerry West. So superteams have always existed, but the level of star players joining forces all at once, and specifically at the players request has been unprecedented.  That's not to say it's necessarily a bad thing, and I don't think it's really hurt parity too much, but it is just something to note. In the era of player empowerment (which I'm 100% here for) there have been a lot more superteams forming at the hands of the players, rather than in days past where FOs would draft/develop all NBA guys Bird/McHale/Parish Celtics, MJ/Pippen Bulls, Dirk/Nash/Finley Mavs, Duncan/Manu/Parker/Robinson Spurs"
Kendrick Perkins is a media clown. The Brooklyn Nets are going to win the championship if Kyrie Irving plays and the Big 3 is healthy.   Kevin Durant is the best player in the league and the Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the league.   The Brooklyn Nets will sweep the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers in the NBA Finals.
I apologize. Bradley Beal averages 9 more points on 54%EFG and Kyrie averages 26 on 56. Who has Kevin Durant on his team.
"&gt; Ironic he left GS cuz he wanted earn a chip on his own (his words not mind)  Pretty sure [Durant said literally the opposite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2020/12/21/kevin-durant-going-to-the-nets-was-not-trying-to-prove-i-can-make-my-own-thing/?sh=4cbca0505b14) in his own words:  &gt; “Everything I’ve been a part of is my own,” Durant said on a Zoom call with reporters ahead of Tuesday’s season-opener against Golden State in Brooklyn. “I feel like every team that I’ve been a part of, I left my mark on each team. I stamped what I bring to the table and I never looked at it as mines. &gt;  &gt; “I don’t look at the Nets as mines, it’s our team and it’s from the fans to the owners to the players, it’s our team, and I feel like I add my piece to the game. And my role is to go out there and be me every single game. I might play more, get more touches than other guys but I still don’t feel like it’s just mine so when I was with OKC and I was with the Warriors, nobody on our team felt like it was one guy’s chance to take this whole thing over or to have one singular voice. No matter where I played since I was 8 or 9 years old, it’s always been about the team, so I try to shy away from...My game is going to speak for itself but personality-wise, individual-wise, I try not to make myself bigger than the group but I know I add to a basketball club and I felt that way with the Warriors. &gt;  &gt; “***So it wasn’t about me going to the Nets to try to prove that I can make my own thing, whatever the hell that means.*** It’s just that I’m coming here to play basketball and add to a group of great guys.”"
"Hes one of the best 2nd options if not the best 2nd option we have in the nba (if you even consider Anthony Davis a 2nd option player when most would say hes a top 5 player in the league right now). When it came down to it in the Finals, he was a gigantic reason they won that series.  He obviously has tried and failed to be a leader and a first option but to discount his ability and say he's not even top 20 is absolutely foolish (Kevin Durant also tried and failed to be a first option for years before he joined the Warriors and won thanks to the leadership of Draymond and Curry). The difference between Kyrie and no Kyrie for that Cavs team was literally a championship (they could have beat the Warriors the year before as well if Kyrie wasnt injured), so your take that Kyrie doesn't make a team better or impact the game is ridiculous.  At best he is a fringe top 10 player, but I think for sure he is top 15. And I don't know about saying Dame is better than him. Dame has never made the finals as a first option and he has been outmatched in every way in a number of series. And its also hard to say that he could be a good enough second option like Kyrie also."
"You're right, he always played with a top 15 player who had multiple scoring titles and a MVP called Kevin Durant. He scrub bathroom tiles."
"So you just hate on every player not named Steph Curry?   I’ve seen you bash Harden, Giannis, Lebron, Kevin Durant, etc."
"Yeah, because you just resurrected them and started giving them opinions they don’t have.   When Kobe was alive , did he speak on trades? Or tantrums? Was Kobe calling kevin Durant a snake? What was his comment for all the other kyrie drama?  Invoking someone’s dad to put opinions in his mouth because he’s dead"
Marv Albert: *Kevin Durant awaiting for the return of Drazen Petrovic to play alongside him*

The stacked Warriors team with Kevin Durant? You just proved my point.
"""Wow. Wish I could gain 100 lbs in the off season, fuck around at strip clubs, and throw temper tantrums then get teammates like Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. That's easy. Being a good teammate and staying in a small market. That takes skill."""
"He’s killing someone lol. But jokes aside, harden isn’t a good 3p shooter- he’s average or slightly below average. His elite efficiency comes from ball handling and stepping in to FTs. So I wouldn’t assume, even with his head on right and participating in the offense, that he suddenly becomes an elite 3p shooter. Kyrie is a sharp shooter, but his elite ability is the iso imo. His dribbling gets him to the basket and he can finish better than anyone in the league under the rim. It’s like the ball just can’t miss the hoop when he’s on. Kevin Durant is the best offensive player on the team and now he’s going to be the best defender and play off ball.  This offense has a lot of problems and 99% of those problems is going to be buy in. There’s going to be a lot of sacrifice from guys who left their last teams because they were unhappy with their role. Kyrie wanted more attention and the ball. Durant wanted more attention and the ball. Harden wanted... idk more of the same I guess no clue what that bitch wants cause he got whatever he wanted. Long story short, I see problems here but it’s not purely fit, but about maximizing talent and their personalities."
Can I say what same thing about LeBron? You mean the decision?  Last time I checked he came back to Cleveland and won a championship? And admitted that he didn’t leave in the best way? Which kind of made up for it all? Has Kevin Durant done any such thing to redeem his character or image?  Otherwise idk what you’re talking about
kevin durant
"Kevin Durant should have known that association with a player as mentally unstable as Irving was dangerous.  Harden's arrival will give him at least a second super star he can count on.  On the other hand, who will accept to sacrifice him in this trio?  Indeed, 3 super stars who love to carry the ball ...  There will always be only one ball on the field. One of them will have to accept to make efforts. Who will be the Chris Bosh of the trio ? And who will be the D.Wade?"
This will always be blamed on Kevin Durant when it comes time to take stock at the end of his career.  That's for sure. He chose the easy way out the day he left for the Warriors rather than staying at OKC to lead them to the title!
"nah but it feels kinda unnecessary, Steve Nash as coach , Kyrie(maybe),Kevin Durant, levert,etc.  it’s like you’re making another super team and the main guys are RING HUNGRY so .. doesn’t help"
"I’m still in disbelief that they were able to pull this off. The two high profile guys in the headlines for off the court issues ending up on the same team, and this same team just happens to have fucking Kevin Durant.   Ridiculous."
"I was playing Nier Automata this morning and thought to myself ""Damn this is just like Kevin Durant""."
Kevin Durant was one of my all time favorite players until he decided to go to Brooklyn. I bleed blue and orange regardless of whatever this damn team puts me through.
"Curry: Chews on mouth guard  Klay: Called Lebron a fuccboi   Green: Gets too animated and enraged during a game  KD:”I wanna focus on basketball and avoid all the drama, we’re also too too heavy to build a team and legacy; I’m going to the Nets”  Teams up with two guys who broke covid protocols to party. One is a flatearther who doesn’t seem like he wants to play anymore, the other straight up just threw his teammates under the bus and forced his way out....  Kevin “grass is greener on the other side” Durant everyone!"
Kevin Durant is never going to pass him the ball because he won’t even realize he’s there
"&gt; I cannot believe Brooklyn has Kevin Durant, James Harden, and ~~Kyrie Irving~~ LOL imagine telling a Nets fan this would happen even three years ago"
Anthony Davis is scared of the Brooklyn Nets. Kevin Durant has a history of destroying LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the playoffs.   Nets in 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers.
Kevin “Don Draper” Durant
You're basically saying each one of them is going to average over 25 points a game. I just don't see that happening.  Kevin Durant is currently averaging 30 a game without the other two guys playing. And one of them takes a whole ton of shots away from other players.
Kevin Durant has never once exceeded our expectations for a whole season. He’s never won on his own and this season would’ve been his last real chance to prove he’s on Lebrons level by winning as the alpha dog.
Kevin Durant carried the Warriors bench. Embarrassing post.

Knicks with the consolation win of forcing Nets to play Kevin Durant in the final minute
"They'll go from probably being the best team in the east to the best team in the east.   Defense will be an issue, but even if Kyrie falls off the side of the planet, it's still James Harden and Kevin Durant. This isn't a KL-PG situation, these are two scoring champs, MVP winners, and offensive firehouses.  We're about to watch real fun basketball from the nets."
Can you imagine how good a team with James Harden and Kevin Durant added to a team that was already a playoff team would be?     The last thing they would need is a (another) weirdo headcase added to the mix.
Kevin Durant is not better than Lebron James. Lebron was able to carry a sorry-ass Cavs team to 5 Finals. Kevin had to join the greatest basketball team of all time to win a championship. Lebron has been and always will be better than KD.
"He's on a stacked team now that Kevin Durant is healthy and he decides to not play the last few games for no reason. No end in sight either. To make it even better, Nets now got a 3rd superstar in James Harden but they are in cap space hell if Kyrie ends up not even playing with his crazy contract."
"If Kevin Durant was likable, then most people would consider him the best player in the NBA. Kevin Durant is the clear cut best player in the NBA. He will get his damn respect in July.  Nets in 4 over the Los Angeles Lakers or Clippers."
"  Update on Kyrie situation.    I’m told he’s been “furious” at the organization for some time for not giving him more input on the head coach hiring. He was not in favor of Steve Nash. Also, his relationship with Kevin Durant has been described as “very distant” recently  Holy shiiit !"
Every time we get a bucket the nets just walk up and drain one. God I wish we had shooters. This grind it out style is brutal and doesn’t work against the indefendible Kevin Durant
"I love how confidently you say a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and possibly Kyrie Irving won’t win shit. Their OKC final together was a long time ago, and they are both two of the best offensive talents of all time. Maybe they won’t win anything, but I am not as confident about that as you are"

James Harden is one of the best scorers and playmakers in NBA history who plays at his best with marksmen on his team and a secondary ball handler to pull some of the scoring and passing load off of him.   Kyrie Irving is (IMO) not a first option for anyone but is one of the best backup guards ever, we saw this in Cleveland when he played behind Bron. His ability to slot in behind another expert scorer and passer let's his iso gifts shine bright.  Kevin Durant is the best scorer ever, hands down. He doesn't like the spotlight and like we saw in Golden State is a fucking savant when you need a bucket from anywhere on the floor. Give him two solid playmakers and two legitimate offensive threats to share the load? We might see the best version of KD.  Imagine a KD/Kyrie PnR with Harden sitting in the corner. How the fuck do you even defend that? Either Kyrie eats his man's lunch, Durant picks his shot in the post or Harden lines up a three. If you don't want them in the floor together? That's fine, you have three of the best ISO scorers ever. Stagger them out so every six minutes one goes in and one comes off. Run Harden/KD while Kyrie rests, then Harden/Kyrie, then Kyrie/KD. Those are three of the top 7 1/2 punches in the NBA today and all three of them thrive on picking apart defenses and setting up a perfect shot.  Now that said, they have the lowest floor of any super team I can possibly imagine. If they play poorly or don't mesh they won't just kill the team they may well kill the franchise. The Nets don't have their own pick for close to a decade and they have no money. They're all in on this trio and they are three of the most volatile personalities in the NBA. Harden might go strip club crazy again, Durant might feel iced out and walk, Kyrie might... Kyrie it up."
Kevin Durant getting Harden to care is his only hope
"By kevin fucking durant and James fucking harden? Of course  What is wrong with you people??? Even peak pippen would get scored on by these guys at a good clip, are you insane?"
Noo..  It's James Harden dude.  Not to mention they also have Kevin Durant.  And Kyrie Irving. Or maybe. I'm not too sure about Irving. He might've signed with a religious group or something
Kevin Durant
So who's going to be the Nets' starting center? Kevin Durant? lol
"Ppl seriously complaining about the bench. They have fucking James Harden, Kevin Durant AND Kyrie Irving AND Joe Harris, Shamet is servicable as well, what do they want that bench to do?"
The team with Kevin Durant where  James Harden is the second option
“KD didn’t know”. We gonna act like Lebron’s pulling the strings behind the scene but Kevin Durant isn’t telling his front office to trade for harden? Fuck outta here
"Ease up man, i love Randle.   But do you think Kevin Durant ever considered wearing safety orange, and walmart blue?   Ya me either."
"Especially on this Nets team where they have been kind of crappy without Harden in the lineup. ""Superteam"" or no superteam, he is very clearly the best player on a team that has Kevin Durant. That's pretty huge."
"Durant's opinion of the bubble:  [Link](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/6/26/21304001/kevin-durant-on-bubble-that-situation-looks-crazy-right-now)  ""Kevin Durant made it clear in [**talking to Marc Spears three weeks ago**](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/6/5/21281792/sources-kevin-durant-will-not-return-during-the-2019-2020-season) that he wasn’t coming back this season, no matter what. “My season is over.” he said. Now, in an interview with Austin Freeman and Chris Wright of [**DawgaTalk101**](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CB3KODJhopg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), KD points out that even if he was well enough, he “probably” wouldn’t have played. The biggest NBA star who’s tested positive for the [**coronavirus**](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/31/21113178/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-travel-china-map) doesn’t like what he’s seeing in the Orlando “bubble.”  “I feel me, right now, probably wouldn’t have played because the unknowns going into that situation looks crazy right now, seeing so many new cases. It’s just so unpredictable. It’s easy for me to say right now because I’m injured. I probably wouldn’t went down there.”"""
"Maybe they will. Kinda depends on where they’re drafted though. Are we still talking about Kawhi in the same way today if he wasn’t drafted to San Antonio?   If these guys are drafted to OKC, they’re likely to become superstars. That organization has produced Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Domas Sabonis, Jeff Green, Steven Adams, and now they’ve turned guys like Dort into productive NBA players. Their player development is off the charts.  If these guys are drafted to somewhere like Cleveland or Sacramento, chances are they’ll be squandered in a bad organization."
"The Thunders would be really good.   Ep 1: Okla-Home-A: the Thunder is born and the team comes to OKC for the first time with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in tow. Shows some background on what happened with Seattle  Ep. 2: The Thunder Rolls: Drafting Harden, and covers the challenge to LA in 2010, taking Dallas to the WCF, and going to the Finals in 2012.   Ep 3: When it Rains, it Pours: Covers the Harden trade post 2012 Finals, the Westbrook injury in 2013, and the tough 2015 season.   Ep 4: You the Real MVP: Covers Durant’s 2014 MVP season and his impact on the city.   Ep 5: New Beginnings: Covers the hire of Billy Donovan and the departure of Kevin Durant in 2016  Ep 6: The Brodie: Episode goes in-depth on Russell Westbrook’s relationship with the city and organization.

Could possibly feature: Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs, Evan Mobley, or Jonathan Kuminga"
"Wow, so no injuries ever I think Penny Hardaway would be a top 5 point guard all time , Grant Hill would be a top 30 player, Bill Walton might overtake one of the main guys we think about on the greatest centers of all time list, look at the career of Derrick Rose and how different that would be oh, and just not to mention the Championships and Seasons that would be different if other all-time great players never got injured, like what if Chris Paul didn't get injured in the 2018 Conference Finals , what if Kevin Durant doesn't get injured in 2019, what if Kyrie and Kevin Love don't get injured in 2015, what is Steph Curry doesn't tweaked his ankle against the rockets in 2016, etc the shit would be all over the place lol"
Alright. James harden at 22 vs Steve Nash at 22... Larry Bird at 22 vs Kevin Durant at 22.   Magic Johnson as a rookie vs Kobe Bryant as a rookie.   It’s fucking ridiculous to say a player can’t do this or can’t do that because of his circumstance right now. How do you know what he’ll do in the future? I don’t. I’m just saying if you watch this dude play it’s clear that his potential is super high and he can be all time great scorer.
If Kevin Durant played with Jokic he’d average 50
You clearly don’t watch him since his ability to create his own shot is nowhere near Kevin Durant lmao.
"In my opinion, Steph Curry earned his rings. He was drafted by the Warriors, developed into a superstar and won League MVP in 2015 while leading his team to the NBA Finals. Although the Cavaliers were mostly Lebron and a string of role players, it definitely wasn't Steph's fault. Of course, you always play to win, what else would you rather he had done?. Injuries and asterisks are always part of the game. Now the Warriors acquiring one of the best players in the world also wasn't his fault, a team coming off a championship run is expected to retool and get better. In the subsequent dynastic years, I believe that, while KD was the best player on the team, they would not have enjoyed a similar degree of success without Stephen Curry on the floor.  Kevin Durant, already regarded as one of the greatest scorers in the game and a former MVP, chose to join a team who had beaten him the prior year , coming back from a 3-1 deficit, had already been to the Finals for two straight years, won the NBA Championship in 2015, the best Regular season record in nearly 70 years of NBA History, had the best shooting backcourt in history, a soon-to-be Defensive Player of the Year , and a cast of solid and functional role players like Igoudala and Livingston. He could have gone anywhere he wanted, yet he chose the path of least resistance. It's not that his rings don't count or anything, but in in the historical  context of what it took to get to the title, his rings are greatly diminished in value.  Steph Curry is greatest shooter of all time, one of the greatest and most transcendent offensive weapon ever deployed at the PG position, a 2x League MVP and a 3x NBA Champion. I truly believe that he was the most important piece in the Warriors Dynasty.  Kevin Durant is arguably the greatest scorer in NBA history and a certified superstar. It's just that KD's championships will never receive the appropriate appreciation because of how convenient it was for him as compared to Dirk Nowitzki in 2011 or Hakeem Olajuwon in 1995."
"&gt;I assume because Steph had already shown he could win a ring without KD's help.  Yes, all he needed was for both Kyrie and Love to be missing for him to win, Kevin Durant would have won in 2012 if Wade and Bosh were injured"
"KD’s OKC team is one of the best teams to lose the finals and are one of (if not THE) greatest what-ifs in NBA history. KD is a GREAT ball player but a shit competitor. He went to GS to guarantee himself a ring. Yes, that lacks competitiveness. Not to mention he joined the best regular season team ever, who were his biggest rivals at the time. Had he gone back to OKC and taken down GS himself he’d be much more respected. Really it comes down to the fact that GS didn’t NEED Kevin Durant, or vice versa. He just wanted to skip the hard steps"
"&gt;Durant's rings are legit, Curry's rings are legit,  No Kevin Durant rings are not 'legit', No Stephen Curry's rings are not 'legit' you put any other Superstar in that position and the outcome is the same. They are real rings but they should be viewed to a lesser degree than other stars rings, both these players have now jumped to everyone Top 15 All Time because of these rings."
Because Kevin Durant joined a 73-9 core he blew a 3-1 lead to
"One of the most efficient high-volume scorers in league history. Here’s a list of every player with multiple seasons of TS% of .62+, usage of 25+ and 1,000+ MP, and how many times they did it:    Kevin Durant — 7   Steph Curry — 6   Adrian Dantley — 5   LeBron James — 3   Giannis Antetokounmpo — 2   Charles Barkley — 2   Amare Stoudemire — 2   Karl-Anthony Towns — 2    That’s the list. In addition to that, there’s only 11 other guys with 1 such season.    Dantley was an amazing individual scorer. Pretty selfish player though, and a lot guys reportedly didn’t like playing with or coaching him. Probably the standard bearer of empty scorers."
"I mean it’s not something you can really hold against the player, but it definitely still is a “bust”. That team spent that draft pick and got nothing for it, when they could have had Kevin Durant."
Skill boost: Kyrie Irving - imagine Kyrie somehow being even more skilled!  Athleticism boost: Joe Harris - defensively he can be a liability due to his lack of athleticism  3 inch size boost: Kevin Durant - the thought of KD being the same player but 3 inches taller is frightening
"If we are going by GameScore, here are the top 10 in NBA history. Note obviously gamescore gives higher points to volume scorers with decent efficiency but it’s a decent metric. Shout out to Jimmy Butler for making the top 10, Shaq for being a beast and Lebron for making 3/10 spots   2000 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.6  2017 - Kevin Durant 30.3  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.1  1993 - Michael Jordan 29.6   2017 - LeBron James 29.6  1991 - Michael Jordan 29.4  1987 - Magic Johnson 28.3  2018 - Lebron James 28.3  2020 - JIMMY BUTLER 27.7  2020 - Lebron James 27.5"
"You’re writing all of this as if it matters. I have never, and will never, ever, watch THJ and Kevin Durant both shoot threes and walk away think Hardaway is better at it. You can bring in all of your pointless stats and analytics. Do you think KD cares about analytics? He cares about scoring and getting to his spots. He doesn’t take more threes because he doesn’t need to. He’s become a top 15 player ever and has won multiple rings taking the amount of threes he takes, so it clearly works. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. He’s a better 3 point shooter than THJ. THJ can jack up as many shots as he wants, KD is better at it."
Wake up you’ve been in a coma for weeks. Life is good Lebron just won the finals after being down 3-1. Kevin Durant is on the Oklahoma City Thunder and is 27 years old. Anything else you hear is part of the delusional consciousness trying to stay in the coma.
"It’s not a bail out take. I’ve never heard anyone use an argument like yours. You’re saying simply because KD doesn’t have an impressive three point percentage at his volume, he’s not a top three point shooter ever. Yet you’re ignoring the fact that because his game is predicated around scoring at all three levels, he’s not solely relying on his three point shot. Comparing him to guys who take half their shots from 3 doesn’t make sense, because that’s their whole game. If Kevin Durant was in Hardaway’s role, even though that’s likely impossible to happen, he’d hit half his threes."
"Neither does Kevin Durant, but he’s considered the second best player of the decade so..."
"Im going to assume you don’t realize why Tim Hardaway Jr. needs to come off curls and needs screens in order to get his shot off, so i’ll explain it to you. In basketball there is a thing called dribbling, or ball handling if you will, which allows a player to move their feet freely without travelling. The player in question, Tim Hardaway Jr., is not great at it, and cannot consistently create his own shoot, so he needs good passers like Luka Doncic and screeners in order to get open. Kevin Durant meanwhile, can dribble at a level higher than a guy at the local ymca and thus, is able to get open off the dribble, minimising his reliance on back screens, elevator screens, horns, curls, etc. They are two different players, one can shoot off the dribble and, for that matter, in any other setting, while the other needs plays drawn up in order to get his shot off. There’s levels to this"
"Why did I lose my respect for Curry? He ran to Kevin Durant to join his team so they could form a superteam after choking a 3-1 lead, his 2 rings are as meaningless as KD's. His 2015 ring was in the most injury riddled playoffs."
Kevin Durant is the better player overall but why did you lose respect for Curry lol?
"Not really sure what that means but you told me Tim Hardaway Jr.s three point shooting capabilities were on par with Kevin Durant, which is laughable and does not deserve a serious response."
"You make me physically ill. I hope you have fun watching Tim Hardaway Jr. in the playoffs, I have pretty high hopes considering he’s a better three point shooter than KEVIN DURANT. Exit basketball reference for a few hours and turn on a basketball game, preferably a Nets game,it’s pretty fun. Let me know how it goes! The goal is to score more than the other team, and they have 4 12 minute quarters, a total of 48 minutes of game time, to beat their opponent. It’s a fun sport, hope your first time watching it goes well."
"The common thing among NBA fans is to have a jersey of their home team and if they have a second jersey, it's more likely to be a Jordan or Iverson college or pro jersey (both Philly and Denver for Iverson) than a second jersey for an active player from their home team.  Growing up in Texas, I also saw a lot of Kevin Durant college jerseys."
"Kevin Durant, his hair is pretty bad"
"There is nothing to disagree with on any of these, even in the case of Lillard, yes then being a 3 seed and getting swept by a six seed was a horrible look but just looking back at that Blazers vs Warriors Conference Finals, no Kevin Durant and it just seems like the Blazers blew some significant double-digit lead in every single game"
"As long as the lack of glory and respect continues to eat away at Kevin “Skin Thinner Than his Legs” Durant and Kyrie “Three Eyes and Zero Brains” Irving, I’ll be satisfied."
"Kevin Durant shot historic amounts of contested shots during his playoff stints with the Warriors.  In the 2014 NBA finals, LeBron averaged 28ppg on 68% TS, and led every game in scoring except one. Not exactly like the Spurs won off of Kawhi's defense on LeBron, they won because their offense shot 53% from the field, and 46% from 3 throughout the finals."
Kevin Durant is why I ripped my pants riding home from work today.
Thon Maker and Kevin Durant/Kevin Garnett
1 Kevin Durant  2 James Harden  3 Kyrie Irving
"I’ve honestly never heard anyone say “Kevin Durant only puts up big numbers and was efficient only on superteams”. He’s widely regarded as a GOAT tier scorer and highly efficient. In 9 seasons in SEA/OKC he posted 25ppg on an efficient 61 TS%. 25.8ppg on 64 TS% in GSW and now 26.7ppg on 67 TS% in Brooklyn.   It would be pointless for anyone to say he’s anything short of incredibly efficient. The only caveat people have, is that Durant isn’t as *dominant* in the playoffs as his 2017 playoff run suggests. A jump in efficiency of that magnitude from 2016-2017 is unheard of. That’s the only issue people have ever had with KD and his efficiency.   But that’s the results you get when a GOAT level scorer is in an all time great shooting system. KD’s only played on two different extremes in terms of spacing his whole career, horrific spacing in OKC and all time spacing in GSW/BK, his true abilities are most likely something in the middle."
Kevin Durant was the best player in the 2012 playoffs and was the best player on the court while playing against prime LeBron
“If MPJ can be Kevin Durant”
Kevin Durant duhhh
"I fucking adore jimmy butler. I would classify him as having superstar impact.  However, Kevin durant is a generational talent and easily a top 3 scorer of all time (if not the best). Dude can score at will. He’s only played 31 games this season, has had injury set backs and is still on of the better scorers in the league while contributing 5 assists and 7 rebounds. Right now durant is still better"
Are you mentioning Stockton in the same breathe as Kevin Durant?
"That's a good point.  That was the definitive ""I’m Kevin Durant. Y’all know who I am."" game.  Lou Will and PatBev's postgame ""I promise we tried"" presser for that game really tied it all together.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiW_kwXwDv0"
"They're pretty good, but I'm partial to LeBron and James  edit: Kevin and Durant were also great."
Is Kevin Durant responsible for rising homelessness in the Bay Area? Return at 11 for wild and unfounded speculation!
He also forgot Kevin Fucking Durant.   Apparently he doesn't know who he is. 😔
"I can’t believe I’m saying this … but Kevin Durant is seriously underrated. I know he’s been injured, but he’s still a top 2-3 player"
"Yeah but Karl Malone and Barkley ran in to Jordan’s Bulls,AI ran in to Shaq and Kobe’s Lakers.Those players didn’t fall short for the same reason as Westbrook. Russ has had Kevin Durant,Paul George,James Harden,and Bradley Beal."
"SAS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS AGAINST THE BROOKLYN NETS I MEAN MY GOD, RUSSEL WESTBROOK! KEVIN DURANT! JAMES HARDEN! THAT OKC TEAM! YOU KNOW WHAT IM TALKIN BOUT PEOPLE I MEAN REALLY, ...but this is a 4 game series, and let me tell you why. Kevin Durant.  MAX: Stephen A I completely agree, BUT YOU ARE WRONG THIS WOULD GO SIX BECAUSE OF ONE MAN. RUSSEL WESTBROOK. RUSSEL WESTBROOK IS A GUY! RUSSEL WESTBROOK IS A DUDE!

"Full quote here :    Kevin Durant: ""You can't stop none of these guys: Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, bad haircut Herro."""
"Oh no, Kevin fucking Durant outplayed Jokic?  No goddamn way!"
"You said nobody has led the league in scoring and efficiency before. I have no idea how you’re qualifying this, but it’s not true no matter how you slice it. Plenty of other players like MJ, Shaq, KD and others have led the league in scoring and been top 10 or 20 in TS% like Steph this year, and first among high volume scorers.  Kevin Durant this very year has a better TS% than Steph. And Jokic is only 1% worse than Steph. On just scoring and efficiency Steph is only slightly ahead of Jokic. And he’s well behind in assists and rebounds. Steph’s defensive impact is also much worse than Jokic. All centers tend to have a much bigger defensive presence because of their size and length, but you don’t deflate their impact because all centers tend to be good.  Again, all of the advanced stats favor Jokic. And you guys are the ones who haven’t watched Jokic this year. He’s been an absolute genius on offense all year, and the team has been completely lost any time he goes to the bench. His scoring, passing and even offensive rebounding is just unstoppable. Steph has been transcendent this year, but Jokic has been even better."
Did you watch Kevin Durant from 2011-2016 before he went to the warriors?? In 2014 he won MVP because he carried an OKC team without Westbrook for most of the season. He’s won 4 scoring titles. I agree with most of the post that I responded to. But saying that KD can’t be the center of a good offense is an asinine statement.
“It’s pretty insane how efficient a team with Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving is!!!”
good job kevin durant. you are a very good player
No thanks to kevin “fucking” durant.
MJP guarding Kevin Durant is the Spiderman pointing at Spiderman meme.
These poor Nets fans. Having to survive with just *check notes* Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"Not to turn this into a ""Iguodala vs CP3"" discussion, but I disagree. I think everything went wrong for the Rockets in that series and they very well could have won.  They didnt, that's all good. CP3 fit great with Harden on that team, and CP3 was definitely the closer as you say.  Harden/Kyrie/KD have proven they step up when it matters. Argue that Harden hasnt, that Kyrie hasnt at times, and that KD needed the Warriors... but they've all been huge contributors on deep playoff teams.  Best the Sixers have done is a 7 game loss to the champ Raptors (should be my flair) where the best Philly player in that series no longer plays for that team (Jimmy B).  The 6ers have something to prove and they wont be the underdog. The Nets have something to prove in a sense, but they have a tonne of talent, and there's one tried and true notion in playoff betting - the team w the best player wins. That player is Kevin Durant.  Love the bet and the banter, hope this series happens even more so now!"
"He'd be a less athletic Kevin Durant, and nearly identical when it comes to game impact. He would be a Top 5 player."
"If it was that easy who does Wade clearly push out of this top 20 list I hastily assembled in two minutes?Nash, Chris Paul, Harden, Barkley, Robinson and others didn't even make the cut...   * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Tim Duncan * Wilt Chamberlain * Shaq * Kobe Bryant * Oscar Robertson * Hakeem Olajowun * Kevin Durant * Bill Russell * Julius Erving * Stephen Curry * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Moses Malone * Kawhi Leonard * Karl Malone"
"He not even the best player on his team when he play with Kevin Durant. Curry fans are something else. This website really take regular season 2 serious. Clowns. GOAT James, Ant Davis, Durant, and Kawhi r better than Curry."
"I'm talking Danny Green and their 6/7. You're definitely right, the Sixers have great individual defense. I think for me it's great offense &gt; great defense here. The only matchups I'm aware of so to speak is Ben and Matisse, the other guys are weaker defenders comparably and need to step up.  Seth will be hunted on defense every time he's on the floor, and the Nets passing should be good enough to get out of double teams/find the open man under the basket.  Man Harden is the guy that teams literally had to double at half every time he had the ball. It worked, because he didnt have reliable guys to pass to. Now he has Kevin fuckin Durant and Kyrie Flat Irving. This will not be an easy matchup for any team."
"&gt;you just look at their accolades?  LeBron, four MVPs, four rings, finals mvp all four times, I think about five or six all-defensive teams, all the all-nba teams and All Star appearances  &gt;you just look at their stats?  Probably James Harden, when you take his time over the past five or six years I'd say he's been the best regular-season player overall during that stretch  &gt;you just look at how they play on the court?  Either Kevin Durant or Steph Curry , Kevin Durand because it's just so effortless , he's 7 ft tall with a 7-6 wingspan and all that other stuff Stephen A Smith says, nobody can block his shot and sometimes when you're just not paying attention the motherfuker got you 33 points on 12 shots or some crazy efficiency like that, Steph Curry because of the distance and how effortless he makes that look, the handle, the arrogance in which he plays with and I can't think of another guard his size that's had to be guarded the way he has"
"&amp;#x200B;  |Player|Pts/75|rTS%| |:-|:-|:-| |Wilt Chamberlain 1960-66(His best scoring seasons stretch)|29.7|\+4%| |Kevin Durant 2010-14|29.0|\+8%|  I'm sorry but your feelings are not facts. Kevin Durant is a better scorer than Wilt Chamberlain, regular season and playoffs. If KD or any other star played 140 possessions every game, they would also average 50 points. Wilt was barely above league average in efficiency"
"&gt;The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen. If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint. Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  You dont really seem to get that Danny Green cant guard Harden and if Thybulle is on the floor their offense is gonna be bad. Tobias Harris and Seth Curry will also have to play big minutes. Its not gonna be like you are thinking at all. Embid is gonna have to sometimes. Also you keep ignoring that they are going to get burned in Drop coverage heavy.  &gt;'m more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers. Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender. If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all. You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster. Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing. The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that. That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5. All bad defensive setups. Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum. If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  Harris has never been known as a good defender in his career ever. He will get roasted by any of the big three...like any of them, same with Seth Curry. I'm basing this on the reality of what they are. Okay so you know nothing about the Nets basically and are talking about things you dont know.  They have not said that. They have been trying to move away from Jordan for awhile. Claxton has been called their best defender by Nash. He's much better on defense than Griffin, you do not know what you are talking about.   They are benching DJ right now for Griffin too and as Claxton ramps up he will get more minutes. They wanted to bench DJ when Aldridge was there too. Which is why Claxton got minutes the very first day Aldridge got there and DJ got a DNP.  Every single metric shows DeAndre as a poor player, they are not gonna play him good minutes in the playoffs. Claxton will get minutes. That is flat out false lol. Nash literally called him their best defender. DJ literally was a DNP last game. They may experiment with BG at the 5 but once Harden comes back its gonna be clear Claxton needs to be the center.  Nic Claxton has also been on Covid protocol for awhile and Nash has been ramping up his minutes as he only got back two games ago.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;No, that's not what spacing is. Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping. And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot. If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers. You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule. Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team. Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  Spacing is the result of having good shooters on the floor you cant leave, you arent getting it. The Rockets had no off ball movement at all. All Harden/KD/Kyrie has to do is get by his initial defender and the others already have an advantage. Houston had stationary shooters for years and their offense was great, LOL now those stationary shooters are KD/Kyrie/Shamet/Harris, you do not know what you are talking about.  You are reaching hard.  Younger Gobert? Lol it was 2-3 years ago when Gobert was still a defensive force in the league and it happend 2 years in a row. Embid is not a better defender than Gobert. Harden destroyed them the first two-three games in both series. It took them 2 games to adjust. By then Cp3 could kill them when they ran drop coverage lol, what do you think Kyrie and KD are going to do Embid. And the only reason Harden did poorly in those last couple of games was because they were sitting on his left forcing him right, something that DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. They built their whole offense around stopping Harden, good luck doing that with KD and Kyrie on the team.  The thing is....Philly is actually only marginally better on offense than those Utah teams as well. To boost their offense you would need to play Curry and he's gonna get reamed on defense.   &gt;It's not a lazy take. The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense. We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it. Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game. We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency. This obviously isn't a bad idea, the man is the best pure scorer in the NBA. But Steph/Klay/Dray all had to be selfless in order to integrate Kevin Durant. And Kevin Durant is a hyperefficient scorer whose only goal was to win. Granted he phoned it in the next two years and refused to run our offense, but our stars sacrificed for him. Kyrie and Harden simply are not as selfless as Steph and Klay. Harden and KD both think they are ""the guy"" and there is eventually going to be friction. Just like there was with Shaq and Kobe. Just like there was initially with LBJ and DWade. Steph was our guy and stepped back for KD, and he didn't care who ""the guy"" was. The difference to your current setup is there is a third star with a history of problems in this exact area and locker room drama and this ""big 3"" has only played 2 games together.   &gt;   &gt;You are grasping at straws and I think you are really emotionally invested in Harden getting a championship here. I'm not rooting against them, I personally visually love Kyrie's game and KD is fascinating to watch, and Harden is who the other team has to game plan around. But I just do not see this as a good fit. I see the same perfect storm around each team like last year's Clips who get hype because of the talent before people take the rose colored goggles off and notice their flaws.  Mhmm..narrative nonsense.   You are grasping at straws. You have an idealistic view that off ball-movement based offense is best and only the players who fit that mold will win.   Harden and KD is one of the best fits in the league and Harden and Kyrie literally went like 16-3 together."
&gt;I mean we all know the classic Kevin Durant rings at GSW don't count because things were so easy for him at GSW and I agree but does the same apply to Steph?    No. Just because a ring is easy doesn't mean its not a ring. KD won 2. Live with it.
"Why are you bringing up things that has nothing to do with Op's question? Kevin Durant's 2012 run was simply better than Steph Curry 2015 run, Kevin Durant would have beat the Heat to if Wade and Bosh were injured in the Finals. I don't care for what happened in 2016 because it has nothing to do with OP's question. KD faced the better teams, had better stats, better efficiency and only lost to Lebron James at his peak with his Superteam."
Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. I really wasn’t expecting KD to be THIS good considering the fact that he had a major injury and hadn’t played in an year and a half. AD has been super disappointing for me. The fact that the team is still relying on Lebron more than AD speaks for it self.
Kevin Durant would have one too if Wade and Bosh were injured in the Finals
"Kevin Durant would have won to if Wade and Bosh were injured in the Finals, wtf kind of logic is this? KD faced harder competition and had the better numbers, I'll give the edge to Durant"
"&gt;  He's gonna have to. There is a reason Gobert has never done well against the Rockets lmao. Its because his drop coverage gets him played off the floor. Kyrie, James and KD will kill him that way, be it easy mid rangers or pull up threes. Harden will get possessions with him on the perimeter. They simply do not have enough to slow them down.  The Jazz defense is great and they have a better team defensive system, but typically when Rudy Gobert leaves the key, bad things happen.  If you've watched the Sixers this year, Embiid doesn't leave the paint.  Again, he has the lucky advantage of very switchable teammates with length and athleticism.  &gt;  Lmao and if one of Harris or Thybulle are in there, either there offense suffers or there defense suffers. Danny Green also cannot guard Harden one on one either. He will absolutely be pulling that extra defender be it iso or pick and roll, never mind that in your scenario Kyrie or KD(two of the best iso players in the game) are still getting one on one coverage at the end of the day lol.  I'm more and more getting the impression that you don't watch the Sixers.  Harris isn't DPOY caliber in his minutes like Simmons, Thybulle, and Embiid when he tries, but Harris is an excellent and versatile defender.  If you'd watched Sixers basketball, what you're describing is not how they've defended the pick and roll at all.  You're generalizing with a vague idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the roster.  Also, you seem to be basing this idea that Claxton will get playoff minutes on nothing.  The starting lineup contains DAJ and will for the playoffs, they've already said that.  That doesn't exclude the possibility of him playing light minutes to start with Claxton off the bench, but what they've been experimenting with more is KD going down to the 4 and Blake at the 5.  All bad defensive setups.  Claxton is only slightly better on offense or defense, and the politics are keeping his minutes to a minimum.  If LMA were still playing Claxton would never take off his warmups anymore.  &gt;  Yes it is, that's literally what spacing is, what are you talking about. We had decent spacing in Houston, not great. Turrets? We had average to below average shooters who took a lot of 3s. That was pre floater Harden and Harden being the only all star on his team. Damn...its a shame Harden has never beaten a team with a great rim protector....Gobert lol. Kyrie and KD dont have to run around any screens, we didnt do that in Houston. Harden can get them open looks by them standing still. But just to be clear, KD and Kyrie to get around screens that;s a lie. Harris will be playing plenty of minutes.  No, that's not what spacing is.  Spacing is the result of something, not literally someone just sniping.  And any decent NBA defender can recover to a stationary turret to contest a shot.  If there is no off ball movement, the spacing suffers.  You're pointing to one playoff victory over Gobert when he was younger as proof of your erroneous point, but you're really just highlighting the exception to the rule.  Not only that, but Harden's efficiency really suffered that series and the Rockets won because they were clearly a far superior overall team.  Good luck replicating that on current Rudy or Embiid, especially with no off ball movement and a far worse defense than in Houston.  &gt;  This is lazy take bro. This is essentially ""there is only one ball""  It's not a lazy take.  The Warriors moved heaven and Earth to fit KD into their offense.  We fundamentally changed our offense to work him into it.  Steph had just led the league in scoring while shooting 50/45/90 and he took 2 fewer shots per game.  We also made all of our triangle sets feature KD in scoring position, which gave Steph a lower quality shot selection and lowered his efficiency.

"&gt;It is easy. Harden is a way better scorer, having 36 and 34 pt seasons Even Durant's MVP year dont come close. Harden is way better playmaker too.  If you genuinely think James Harden is a “way better scorer” than Kevin Durant you don’t understand basketball.   &gt;If you think KD is better despite all this statistical evidence, then that is the definition of emotional based analysis.  You haven’t provided a lick of statistical analysis lmao"
"Y’all dumbasses can talk about health all you want. Did you forget this is a sport? Which also includes injuries? This isn’t 2K where you can just turn the settings off. There’s no point putting asteriks on things because someone couldn’t stay healthy. There’s also no point creating fake ass scenarios that didn’t happen. The Raptors load managed Kawhi for a reason, like it or not. That converted into a championship. The Warriors clearly didn’t manage their players enough that season, resulting in an injury. Maybe the Warriors shouldn’t have needed to spend all their energy beating a CP3less Rockets? Do I need to remind you of the series the Raptors went through to get their Chip? It’s not just about the Finals it’s also about how you got there. Sometimes these things (injuries) can be avoided with the proper measures in place. No one wants to talk about how Kawhi was having a historic post season on a bad leg? How many games did Klay actually miss? Count them. Everyone loves talking about how OP Kevin durant to the Warriors was, the Raptors beat a KDless team and all of a sudden the Raps had the advantage and the Warriors sucked? Klay Thompson played 32+ minutes in 5/6 games of the 2019 NBA Finals. Now tell me, with that information, why do NBA fans want to make it sound like he missed the whole series? Enough with the hypothetical bullshit. The Raptors won that year and they’re in the history books."
Kevin Durant OKC -&gt; GSW. Randle literally this year. There are easier ways to say you don't watch basketball.
"I don't think it's the same lol. It's not like Steph can say ""nah I don't want KD to join because I won't get to be the undisputed #1 option"". That's kinda just being selfish and prioritizing what he wants over what his FO and teammates want. If everyone else wants KD to join how can he say no? He would be interfering with his teammates trying to win again and his FO trying to build the best team they can just because of ego? It's just actively choosing to make the team worse for arbitrary reasons. It's on KD for choosing to go there, he can easily go anywhere else. The Cavs and LeBron were recruiting KD too, right after they won the title in 2016! Literally every team would have accepted him lol  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/12/lebron-james-recruited-kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-cleveland-cavaliers-2016"
"A list of American bigs who can do those things off of the top of my head (active only): Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns, Zion"
"Players being more involved in organizing the players they play with and how the team plays in general.   Lebron broke the norm when he signed a 3 year deal after his rookie contract was up, Wade and Bosh also did this. This was clearly organized and discussed beforehand in order to set up teaming up. They wanted Melo to do it, but he wanted his money and guaranteed so he got the full max with full years, like every other player out there.  From there he went to the Cavs but only on the conditions that they're willing to give him more control with who is on the team, ensuring they spend as much as possible, and making sure they trade for Kevin Love.  In terms of his best friend running an agency, they're able to essentially tamper without tampering and make one another money. That setup is magical as they're using Lebron's status to recruit, Lebron praises players signed with Klutch more often, and teams Lebron is on often sign those same players almost solely because Lebron wants it. KCP signed on an inflated contract with the Lakers almost solely due to the clutch connection.  Other players like Durant have even credited him for starting this trend while other old time players blame him for it. This type of arrangement and thinking definitely shows forethought and strategic planning to maximize they're control and power in a league where the power for team management was always on the front office's side. Kobe couldn't even get the Lakers to trade Bynum when he wanted."
"If it were anyone other than KD it'd be easier to take seriously. Kevin ""I literally got a rule created because of my offensive tricks"" Durant. It's hilarious to hear him talk about other people baiting fouls with clever moves, since he's one of the kings of that.  Though I'm guessing Luka probably does the same thing when he talks to refs. I'd eyeroll if I heard him do it too, though."
The Kevin Durant was just an example. Like I said it’s a difficult job I’m 100% sure but also like I said. It’s the job they signed up to do. Missed calls happen of course I’m not saying they should never happen. People are human. But the difference between your friends and nba level refs is nba level refs have so much technology on their side that can show they were wrong and yet they will still make the wrong call and when it comes out in the L2M report they still do not have to answer for it. And there’s literally no excuse for guys like Jayson Tatum or JJ redick getting Ts or even ejected (this year) for bouncing a ball or passing a ball too hard at a ref.
"It's a little weird when it comes from Kevin ""Rip-through Daddy"" Durant"
"Both can exist you’re right, but when players fuck up they have to answer questions explaining why they fucked up. Refs can miss a whole Kevin Durant “saving a ball” by standing damn near in the front row seats and players can’t even talk about it and they don’t even have to answer questions about why they came to that decision. It’s difficult I’m sure. But that’s the job they signed up for. It makes completely no sense that they have the power of instant replay and still mess up games or the go on power trips and T people up for bouncing balls “hard”."
"No, he doesn’t.  Very few people are capable of fitting into any offensive system.  Harden IS the system.  He’s not running a motion offense, he’s not running triangle sets.  He’s running pick and rolls and hunting for mismatches.  If he gives up the ball it’s for an immediate shot/layup/dunk or because he got stuck.  When it’s not his “turn” to run the offense he stands at the 3 point line without moving as a “spacer”, which is better than what he did with CP3 and RWB in Houston where he routinely didn’t make it past half court for those possessions and let them play 4v5.  Kevin Durant can fit into any system because he’s capable of moving off ball, hitting set shots, playing iso ball, hitting open players when he attracts too much defensive attention, and playing elite defense.  Harden does not put in a defensive effort and does not move off ball.  If you think a player can fit into any system just because they have a high bbiq, I’ll refer you to Rondo clashing with Rick Carlisle’s system in Dallas.  Rondo is one of the 5 sharpest basketball minds in the NBA, and he was so such a bad fit that he legitimately gave up on his team, embarrassed himself and fucked over his own reputation.  Harden plays well when his floor is spaced by other shooters, especially those who move off ball well, and a good big man for pick and roll screens capable of being a heavy alley oop threat.  He has a geriatric Blake Griffin and DAJ, and the best floor spacer (Joe Harris) is who he replaced in the starting lineup when he got there.  He is not a good fit where he is and he’d be a slightly worse fit with the Warriors.  People are being tricked into thinking it’s an okay fit because, as usual, he’s winning regular season games.  The big 3 over there haven’t played together (literally two games) and they’re expected to roll over the Sixers?  Fit and matchup matter, and I’m glad the dubs didn’t get him.  I’d much rather wait a year and have Klay, who isn’t as good as Harden but a much better fit."
They played like 8 years together. Zero championships. With Kevin Durant.  If Westbrook was great they should have at least snuck in one.
"&gt; Also John Wall had even more time to recover from his achilles tear than Kevin Durant  do you mean... john wall had even more time away from the game meaning he lost more conditioning, practice, and has more to adjust to?  isn't that what i JUST said in my other posts"
It's funny how much stuff like that makes a difference. In college I had really skinny arms and a decent wingspan so id call them Kevin Durant arms and people would always go along with it
The difference is that Hayward never an achilles tear that is known to permanently decrease players' athleticism to a very noticeable degree. Also John Wall had even more time to recover from his achilles tear than Kevin Durant yet looks significantly worse on the court and is still plagued by follow-up injuries.  Wall basically looks exactly like people fear when they hear achilles tear while Durant is the positive outlier.
Kevin Durant is the most overrated player of this generation
Kyrie was on the same team as Lebron James and is now on a team with Kevin Durant and James Harden
"Kevin Durant  Better in the clutch, better defensively, scoring is arguable  Harden is a better playmaker though"
Kobe and Kevin Durant both won championships.
"This is really dope. Great back and forth between them, why the fuck don’t they show stuff like this more often? Maybe because most of the time when a player’s talking to red it’s not as calm or family friendly as this. But yeah I hope we see more convos/footage like this. Fuck Kevin Durant"
Injuries derailed Kevin Durant and Steph Curry for a while too.   Always sucks and almost always changes the NBA landscape when it happens.
Gonna say the team that still has Kevin Durant (and Kyrie Irving) is gonna beat the team whose second best scorer is Kyle Kuzma.
The one with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving???
"&gt;Lol, I knew the Cavs were screwed when y'all went from a trash guard to literally Kevin Durant  Yeah that must have been a really hot take at the time."
Just use Getty's preview images:  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/kevin-durant-of-the-united-states-dunks-during-the-mens-basketball-picture-id1234421913?k=6&amp;m=1234421913&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=ifJAQqpoWTgmbxYC3ekG4caq1MQ7gQPd0qNN7GFfy9E=
"James Harden was a bench player when he played with Russ and KD, stop being disingenuous. Harden started a grand total of 7 games in his three years in OKC and while he did win sixth man of the year, he also averaged 12 ppg on 37/31/79 splits in that Finals against the Heat, he wasn't 10% of the James Harden we know now.  Amar'e Stoudemire also didn't make five All-NBA teams in seven years by accident, he was putting up 25 and 9 on 56% FG with ease. Stoudemire, Marion and Joe Johnson aren't Kevin Durant, but they offered Nash alot of help."
"1. What do you mean ""another""? 2. What were they realistically supposed to get in the trade? Spencer Dinwiddie was a UFA who everyone knew was leaving. He could've just signed with a cap space team and the Nets would have gotten nothing.  3. That completely random Capela ""rumor"" by the random fan (not even some low-level writer, but literally just a random fan) on Twitter seems to have given people completely unrealistic expectations of what was going to happen. 4. The current roster includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Bruce Brown, and Nicolas Claxton. I think they'll be fine."
"You can’t just go and paint a broad brush over it, and not every situation is the same. Fact of the matter is KLove put up numbers on a bad team and showed he was pretty meh as a third wheel and wasn’t a major contributor to that championship team. As a “super team” they got fucking smoked by the warriors in 2017. They weren’t remotely in the same class. They never even won 60 games in a season together those three years. They got lucky 1 year and won a ring they probably shouldn’t have.  You can look at a team as it’s constructed and say it’s supposed to be a super team, but subsequent events can change that perception later. People thought the 04 lakers were a super team but a loss and a Malone injury and now no one says that.  You can look at the nets and say they are on paper a super team but if they never play a season together then how can it be a super team? If Kevin Durant and Kyrie won a ring and harden was out the whole season would you still call it a super team and discount KD?"
"Dude I hope you do. I absolutely hate to see the Russ slander here. I cannot think of an all star level guy who doesn’t give a fuck/goes as hard as he does. People really don’t appreciate what they have.   Sure, he’s made dumb mistakes and can’t shoot like Kevin Durant but I think both of these criticisms are widely overblown in a league full of hyper analytics. Dude reminds me of DWade"
"Kyrie, a player known for his scoring, put up 20.4/4.4/6.4 on 35.6/22/91 shooting splits against the Bucks in 2019.  Embiid, against the Raptors, put up 18/9/3 on 37/34/84 shooting splits.  Lowry against the Wizards put up 12/5.5/4.8 on 32/22/73 shooting splits.  Harden put up 24.5/4.5/10 on 41/31/88 shooting splits against the Spurs in 2017.  Damian Lillard against the Pelicans in 2018 put up 18.5/4.5/4.8 on 35/30/88 shooting splits.  Durant against the Mavericks in 2016 put up 26/6.4/3.2 on 37/28/85 shooting splits.  STEPH CURRY put up 24/5/5 on 40/28/90 shooting splits against the Rockets in 2019 with KEVIN DURANT, KLAY THOMSON, AND DRAYMOND ON HIS TEAM.  Dirk in his MVP year as first seed against the Warriors put up 19.7/11.3/2.3 on 38/21/84 shooting splits.  Russ put up 19/10.4/11.8 on 33/25/65 shooting splits.   Seems like other top 15 players 100% would put up such awful shooting splits in a single series with crappy teammates or against great defensive teams with a gameplan to stop them."
"It's never a guarantee, and that's important to note, but I disagree with both your objection and your list of teams.  Let me try to use baseball to get across what I'm trying to say.  The Yankees may not have the highest payroll in baseball every year, but for as long as most people can remember, they have never really acted as though they are under any financial constraints.  They just go out and sign the most expensive free agents or trade for those same guys once their original teams realize they can't afford them anymore, so when you look up and down their roster, it's full of guys like Gerrit Cole, Giancarlo Stanton, Aroldis Chapman, and so forth.    Yankees fans always defend their titles by saying they did it with home grown players.  For years, they touted the ""Core Four"" of Jeter, Posada, Rivera, and Pettitte.  Yes, those were four guys that they developed internally, but the reason why they stuck around so long in New York is because whenever they wanted money, they got it.  If the Pittsburgh Pirates developed that Core Four, they would have all left the Pirates as soon as they became free agents, if not sooner.  So the notion that they were entirely homegrown doesn't really hold much water once you get past the early team control period.    Likewise, the counterargument that they bring up when they are criticized for buying players is that they don't always win, therefore money doesn't guarantee you a title.  Problem is, no one is arguing that, either.  When people complain about the Yankees buying their players, it's not because they are guaranteed a title, but rather because they get more kicks at the can when they do that, and because of how much money they have, they can just erase mistakes that they make by paying large portions of salary when they dump a guy, or by just burying him on the bench behind another guy they just paid.  Teams like the Reds and Royals can't afford to do that, so they have to approach player acquisition in a much different manner.  In basketball, it's much the same, even if the landscape for team building is completely different because of things like the salary cap and max contracts.  Max contracts are, in my opinion, a real issue in the NBA, because the limit what the top players can be paid and thus eliminate any bidding wars for those players.  If you want Kevin Durant to come play for you, you can't offer him more money than anyone else, so his decision to join you comes down to two things: (a) the city, and (b) who he's going to be playing with.  And ever since LeBron and company decided to do it at the '08 Olympics, it's been player-driven movement to particular cities.  It doesn't mean you *can't* win by building your team the ""traditional"" way, it just means that it's incredibly difficult to do so, and it's a formula for catching lightning in a bottle, not a formula for lasting success."
"&gt; Don’t remember nash playing with Kevin Durant  Nash did play with Dirk, who was the closest thing to KD at the time. That team had a bunch of other problems though, like Cuban trying to GM 2K-style (eg, getting both Antoine Walker and Antawn Jamison)."
"I mean, Russ has played with some pretty unbelievable teammates, I could easily argue it is those teammates that helped drive winning/advancing over Russ. The one year he didn't the Thunder got trounced in the first round of the playoffs.  Every other year of his career he has had at least one of Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Paul George. This year with Beal, who you could argue is a tier below those guys, the Wiz also got thrashed."
"So in scrolling thru, it seemed like you’re biased to make Steph seem more important/make it seem closer than it was. Even strategically not posting his stats in some cases.   Then I got to this:  Durant 35/5/4 vs Steph 25/5/5 : equally important. 🤨 Yea you’re biased bruh.   Numbers aren’t everything but when all things are pretty equally, uh, yea the numbers  do matter. They’re both scoring, they’re both facilitating. Steph is a scoring guard so it’s a pretty apples to apples comp. It’s not like we’re comparing Magic vs Kareeem where the stats can relatively be put aside. Steph isn’t giving you 8+ pasta a game like a traditional PG. he’s not a defender. So he’s judged on scoring—-and the next guy did it better. Simple as that. That doesn’t mean Steph ain’t great but Durant is just better.   If for no other reason, KD at 7ft is more impervious to a bad game or being slowed down by defense. There is no answer for kevin Durant. Period. Whereas I’ve seen with my own two eyes Steph struggle for majority of a series, have problems with certain defenders, or just not make shots as tends to happens when you’re a guard sized shooter. KD is largely bulletproof from all that AND THE NUMBERS BACK IT. KD is/was better. No need to try and finagle a way into a different conclusion."
"The warriors went 73-9 and added Kevin Durant. They earned it by building a great team, but they will forever be the most stacked team ever and nothing will come quite close."
Woah now watch out here this guy is giving a level headed response on Kevin Durant
Yeah who needs Kevin Durant and James Harden when you have Shawn Marion and Joe Johnson
It's Kevin Durant.
"They won't let me to make this into a post so I'm just going to copy paste it here. It's about KD and Harden but it's similar to KD/Curry  Kevin Durant is an incredibly overrated player. His impact on the team ends with his own performance. He can't control the game like LeBron and Harden, he can't make role players from C- to B+. His (Nets) offense was scoring 80 points in several games in this last series. He makes incredibly tough shots that take godly skills and that only he can make and that's why people think his 40 is so much better than Embiid's 40 with 17 flopped FTs. In reality 40 is 40 and artistic touch doesn't matter. He scored 49 on 36 shots in game 7. Or 32 on 30 shots in game 6. You can give him credit for playing all the crazy minutes but I mean how much is LeBron scoring on 36 shots? Or Curry? Or Harden? Harden got this team scoring 140 every other game and no it's not only because of Kyrie. Playmaking is the second most important skill in basketball and KD is not elite at it while there are guys in the league elite both at scoring and playmaking.  Harden didn't win a ring again so people will continue to put him at like number 7 in the league but before he got hurt he was arguably the best player of the first round along with Kawhi and Nets are a much better team when he is the Batman and running the show. He just has the game under control, understands the tempo, when to run what, he is LeBronesque in that sense. Kevin Durant essentially plays like Micheal Beasley but he is so much better than Beasley that he can pull it off efficiently and no shot can be considered a ""low IQ"" shot for him because he can make pretty much any type of shot. Still, no matter how good he is, that style of play will never have the same impact and uplift other players on the team like it's the case with LeBron, Harden, Curry.."
Yeah and none of them are Kevin Durant or James harden lmao. You can’t just name good players and put them on the same level as a generational talent.
"Nash has never had teammates as good as Russ’s. Russel Westbrook has Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Paul George. I love Amare but Prime Nash never had anywhere near those level of teammates. Put Kevin Durant on those sun teams and remove Amare they win a minimum of one championship if not more."
https://brobible.com/sports/article/kevin-durant-tweet-scarlett-johansson-bath-water/ he doubled down on the bathwater
"He’s not a “loser” because obviously he’s fucking not one, but “hey he won one finals game with Kevin Durant and James Harden (not to mention a  prime Serge Ibaka) on his team” is not a winning argument in this debate. He’s played with larger list of near-prime superstars than just about anybody else in league history."
"&gt;Klay is going to return and go back to being himself, an extremely valuable piece on a contending team, they don't even deserve to be in the same discussion.  Klay hasn't even played a single game since signing that contract. Thinking he will be close to what he was before is just ridiculous, especially after 2 major injuries. He's more likely to be like John Wall than Kevin Durant. And I say this knowing Durant missed most of the last 2 seasons"
"Let’s go with it. Here’s a response for Kevin Durant:  Yo KD, you really hurt a lot of gay people’s feelings with what you said. I hope you understand saying it in private doesn’t mean it’s less harmful. We all make mistakes but this one hurt a lot of people. Doesn’t make you a bad basketball player or trash, but speaking your mind can sometimes make other people feel excluded. Asshole, loser, irrelevant are all things Rappaport is that don’t denigrate gays."
"&gt; I would rather have Thad straight up...  You're behind by about 2-3 years.  &gt;  LaVine became an efficient 27 point-per-game scorer last season on a game fueled by explosive at-rim baskets and deep 3s, yet he will now share a backcourt with DeRozan, whose midrange style is a relic of a bygone era of basketball. But DeRozan’s shot selection and playmaking also quietly evolved in his three seasons with the Spurs. Since 2018-19, DeRozan ranks third in isolation scoring efficiency among all 104 players to log at least 200 chances, according to Second Spectrum. Only Steph Curry and James Harden rank ahead of him. Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson are right behind him.  &gt; This statistic may come as a surprise, considering DeRozan’s reputation as an inefficient player. But even on the Spurs, a team without a lot of knockdown 3-point shooting on the roster, DeRozan was able to feast, getting to the basket or pulling up from midrange.  &gt; That uptick in scoring efficiency is a by-product of DeRozan’s playmaking development. He takes better shots and looks to pass far more frequently. He weaponizes the threat of his midrange jumper, snaking his way into the paint and using jabs or pump fakes to draw defenders out of position and open passing windows. He plays with a seasoning that he lacked earlier in his career, when he was making All-Star teams."
Not if you are Kevin Durant.
"fellas, is it sus to have an account solely dedicated to defending every action taken by kevin durant?"
OKC Kevin Durant in the regular season: 30/8/4 on 62% TS  In the playoffs: 29/8/4 on 57% TS  Also lets look at Steph Curry from 2013-16  Regular: 25/5/8 on 63% TS  Playoffs: 26/4/6 on 59% TS
"to be fair, steve nash could've won it all if he had kevin fucking durant at his side"
"The Harrison Barnes 2016 Finals. All he needed to do was play decent in 1 game and he went abysmal in three straight.   If he played well and the Warriors win that Series, I do not believe Kevin Durant ever ends up in Golden State"
This Kevin Durant guy might be really good.
"&gt; He's been to the NBA Finals,  With James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Prime Ibaka."
Don’t remember nash playing with Kevin Durant  I do like Westbrook a lot but he hasn’t been great consistently in the playoffs
"&gt;He's been to the NBA Finals,   with Kevin Durant, a decade ago  &gt;he's played in 4 Conference Finals  with Kevin Durant"
&gt; for 2022 FA  Who would we even target?  Harden? Kyrie? Kevin Durant? C'mon man.  Lavine is already working on his extension.  Westbrook or Wall? Absolutely no thanks.  That just leaves Beal as the only option left and going all in on that seems really stupid.
Kevin Durant
"They filled the Kevin Durant hole with Andrew Wiggins. There's certainly room left over, but it's not like the hole is wide open. And at the same time they've filled the Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, Quinn Cook, and Jacob Evans slots with Wiseman, Porter, Bjelica, Toscano-Anderson, and Poole. The bench has been upgraded. The Iguodala and Livingston holes still need filling, though."
"A meh run franchise attracted Kevin Durant, signed David West well below his market value, found great rotation pieces in guys like Looney, Damion Lee and JTA, drafted Eric Paschall and Jordan Poole well below their true value and turned Andrew Wiggins into a great defender...but yeah I guess they suck"
Yuck! Gross! Google links.

"&gt;Kevin Durant said he ""probably"" would have skipped Orlando even if fully healthy: ""The unknown going into that situation looks crazy right now, seeing so many new cases. ... I probably would have chilled.""  [Full quote](https://twitter.com/bengolliver/status/1276309378698604545?s=21)"
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain – including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 – all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year – and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
"While I don’t think very highly of the Warriors front office, I can’t really criticize their decisions the past couple years. Imo the roster is really far away from being a championship roster, even with Steph, Dray, and Klay. They have no cap space and there aren’t any superstars forcing their way out right now. There’s a Kevin Durant sized hole on the roster, sort of a no win situation for the organization."
"Here's two reasons I'm abrasive.   1. The last five years of idiocracy has shown what people who just follow their media and do little thinking or learning. Especially prevalent in sports, where few spend time learning deep basketball, it's just shallow entertainment or tribal homerism.  2. My target audience isn't people who think that championships define player ability. The only argument I'll accept is that Durant wasted a ring getting injured, while someone like LeBron managed to be there practically every big game. Take this year for example, the biggest impact play of the playoffs, by an exponential margin, was Kyrie landing on Giannis. That completely saved his legacy, because that's just how most sports fan are simplified to think, but my opinion on most players doesn't change because of low sample size, nor because of these obvious lucky or unlucky breaks.   Kevin Durant is a tier two all time player. If you were drafting from a pool of all players, how do you let him fall past pick 12 or so just to draft some big from 30 years ago? Fit matters, efficiency matters, unstoppable offense over team defense is the cheat code in basketball. Durant is a top 10 talent of all time.   My target audience is not people who can't see that because Durant had to play in the West against the GOAT team and multiple other stacked teams with an ultra ball dominant and ultra inefficient player, in the era of team basketball and pace and space, or this year with injuries to his top two teammtes, because they're clueless about probabilities and reality, Or because they're blinded by Dream Team era basketball, like most of media and even many professional GMs, coaches, players, etc, even though all logic and stats show how much more skilled players are now and how much smarter teams and players are due to years of analytical knowledge and basketball experience."
Luka Doncic or Kevin Durant
Yep it’s definitely up there with the blazers missing out in Jordan and Kevin Durant.
"Harder working, probably not in most cases. Coachable? Well, compare someone like a Giannis or a Jokic to Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving."
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
"He knows it isn't true. Just like 90% of the people who say Drake likes kids know it isn't true. They're either doing it for the memes or because they just hate Drake and don't care about throwing dirt on his name. It's crazy how all these people commenting about Drake being a pedo are NBA fans even though they think several of the highest profile players in the league, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, etc. are close friends with a known pedophile."
"Nope.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/draymond-green-says-kevin-durant-changed-when-lebron-james-was-considered-best-nba-player-after-2017-finals/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2021/7/6/22565221/kevin-durant-defends-tweeting-with-fans-after-report-steve-kerr-wanted-him-to-lay-off  KD stans almost as insecure as him to have to defend KD’s obvious insecurity. It’s made clear through the people around him, the reporters around him, his social media activity, etc"
All time list would be   1. Jordan 2. Kobe 3. Kevin Durant 4. Deron Williams 5. Shaq
"Kevin ""Ellie"" Durant"
or have Kevin Durant and be located in New York
Superstar gets thrown around too often. LeBron is a superstar. MJ was a superstar. Giannis is a superstar. Kevin Durant is one.
"What even is a forward at this point. Because you cannot tell me that Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Cedi Osman all play the same position."
Dosent change the fact that Draymond played at an star level especially in the playoffs. And was apart if the same core of the 2016 super team.  No that's still intent because it didn't happen. You gotta learn your definitions bro. Intent and action are two different things.   According to Howard Beck. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843699-inside-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irvings-plot-to-team-up-in-brooklyn  Can you show me your source for Lebron and AD plotting. Because I can only hazing remeber it happening toward the end of the season.  I already admitted it wasn't accurate to say that the Cavs were a response. I even said if the Warriors didn't make the jump they did then Lebron would have destroyed the league. But like I said a 1000 times. This is about the Lakers not Lebron.   Second how xan the Nets be a response when they were plotting the same time the Lakers were. Funny how you ignored that. And again Nets weren't a super team until they got Harden. And Lakers weren't until they got westbrook.  You gave me an example of a super team. Not a definition. I need a definition otherwise you can just call whatever team you want a super team that fits your narrative.   For example my definition is three all stars and results. By giving you a definition you can hold me accountable and call out my inconsistencies  You know you're inconsistent with your labeling. Whivh is why you don't wanna give me your definition.
That contract being as low as it was was how they were able to sign Kevin Durant.
So ?  Raptors like Kevin durant.  Is that going to happen ?  Nope.
Because Kevin Durant is better than Kobe ever was. The Laker in me can't bear to see that
remember when kevin durant joined the greatest regular season team of all time
"Have you heard of, Kevin Durant?"
"Warriors got Kevin Durant, who carried them to two rings. Only reason why they could stop a healthy Cavs team was because KD carried a 73 win team over the hump"
"there are actually a lot of people hating on the lakers’ moves still, but the nets would have far more because Kevin Durant"
I’m also from a city where Kevin Durant once lived
"Oh yeah I know, I'm just saying the fact that y'all got Kevin Durant to take a pay cut moves the needle way more imo then the cheap players the Lakers got to fill out their roster."
Have Kevin Durant.
Because twittering isn't what got Kevin Durant the reputation for being soft and sensitive. Joining a frigging 73-win team after losing is.
In before Kevin Durant signs.
"LA Lakers now have THREE superstar players (LeBron, AD, Russ). Over half the league doesn't even have 1 superstar player on their respective rosters!  &amp;#x200B;  Then let's look at Brooklyn. Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving. Another team with three friggin superstar players."
"Do you enjoy watching all the NBA superstars play together on a handful of desirable NBA markets? LeBron, AD &amp; Westbrook...superstar players...all on the same team...Kevin Durant, James Harden &amp; Kyrie Irving...superstar players...all on the same team. You have well over half the league without even one superstar player on their roster! xD"
[KD was out for half the season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-stats-2021). While [LBJ](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lebron-james-stats-2021) played 10 more games and had 1 more attempt per game. I still feel as if your selection of referenced players is poor due to injuries lol. And Let's not forget [Curry](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/steph-curry-stats-2021) was hitting 10-12 3s a game while attempting nearly double KD and LBJ.
Ask Kevin Durant
Series averages:  Kevin Durant: 30/6/3 on 46/40/89 shooting(60% TS)  Stephen Curry: 25/7/6 on 47/36/86 shooting(58% TS)  James Harden: 29/6/6 on 42/24/89 shooting(54% TS)  Chris Paul: 20/7/4 on 41/37/75 shooting(52% TS)
Tatum made multiple Conference Finals as the best player on the team. Russell Westbrook has an 8-21 record without Kevin Durant in the playoffs in his career.
"For example:   Michael Jordan changed the way basketball shoes were perceived when he signed his iconic Nike NKE, 1.42%  deal in 1984 and debuted the Air Jordan 1. Basketball shoes became so popular that they soon outgrew the court and were being worn as everyday shoes.  For years, basketball shoes adorned with names like LeBron James and Kevin Durant sold well. But lately, the performance basketball shoe market has struggled.  Basketball shoe sales now represent less than 4% of the athletic shoe market, a massive drop from their 13% market share in 2014, according to data from research firm NPD. In addition, basketball performance shoe sales are also down roughly 13% compared to the same period a year ago, the fourth consecutive year that aggregate basketball shoe sales have declined.  A lot of people are still choosing to wear athletic shoes, but not high performance basketball shoes. What happened?  “This is the culmination of the athleisure trend, where we are wearing athletic inspired footwear and apparel but we don’t intend to use them for sport,” Matt Powell, Senior Industry Advisor at NPD, told MarketWatch.  According to research firm NPD, the athleisure industry grew 7% over a 12-month period in 2019, and shows no signs of slowing down.  That’s one of the reasons having a star like LeBron James’s name on a performance shoe doesn’t guarantee it will sell, which has forced brands to pivot."
"He also looked way worse on defense vs the Nets compared to the Bucks and Raptors. He didn't suddenly become worse as the stats imply, guarding Kyle Lowry or Brogdon/George Hill is different from guarding James Harden and Kevin Durant. Bobby Portis didn't suddenly become a better defender vs Atlanta and Phoenix, the matchup changed. Stats without context don't tell the whole story, the eye test without context doesn't tell the whole story either."
"Joel ""Kevin Durant"" Embiid"
"I don't know, Kevin Durant is going to give him a run for his money"
Nets aren’t really old af.  James Harden: 31 - was an mvp candidate when healthy  Kevin Durant 32 - arguably best player in the league Kyrie - 29  All are 32 or younger and aren’t coming off a season where you question if they’re past their prime.  Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan are the only 2 who really fit that bill and Jordan doesn’t play.
"It's pretty wild that the members of the 50/40/90 club in the last decade are Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Malcolm Brogdon, and Kyrie Irving."
1. Stephen Curry   2. Ray Allen   3. Klay Thompson   4. Reggie Miller   5. Steve Nash   6. Kevin Durant   7. Larry Bird   8. Kyle Korver   9. J.J. Redick    10. Dirk Nowitzki
"Ya, it’s basically the only concern. But he’s got wide shoulders. Looks like a scaled up Kevin Durant.  The other big center prospect is Chet Holmgren - he’s even thinner and doesn’t have a frame to build on"
Kevin Durant in shambles rn
* PG: LeBron James * SG: Michael Jordan * SF: Kawhi Leonard * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Hakeem Olajuwon  You cannot score on this team. Michael Jordan defends the point of attack like he always did on the biggest stage. 6'6-7ft with DPOY potential on four positions and Durant is an elite defender as well.  KD and Kawhi provide spacing. Jordan is cutting defenses apart. LeBron bulldozers people and orchestrates the offense and Hakeem gets tons of easy baskets.   I don't know how this team loses.
Thatll be the year there's either a Michael Jordan 2.0 or Kevin durant 2.0 that goes #2 lmao.
I'm happy to see Kevin Durant redeeming himself for a championship he didn't get this recent season.
"Because they're the USA, reigning champs, and have Kevin Durant."
"“Who do you put on Kevin Durant, Drewwy?” - Andrew Bogut  Mate he’ll be requesting a trade to the Boomers by the end of the 1st"
"He probably got into it with a few Heat fans, it happens. Heat had Wade and Shaq, then the Heatles, then the improbable bubble run when the Bucks were the best team all year before COVID…some Heat fans probably said “after that sweep Giannis ain’t staying!”  Then maybe no credit is given to the Bucks by some Heat fans…Nets would’ve smashed you, Lakers and Clippers injured; Bucks were a fluke…  The imagined vindication is tainted. Bucks won it all, Giannis stayed…That’s awesome …Now let’s hear the naysayers repent…”If Kevin Durant just wore shoes that fit”"

"Either that or put Lebron at PG and add a 6'6+ Hall of Famer with elite defense who can shoot from 3. MJ can defend the point no problem.   Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Hakeem Olajowun is already a nightmare to score on, but you can make it even better by adding more length and defensive prowess."
"Bluntly, Devin Booker played his heart out in the NBA finals, lost, and then got on a plane to Tokyo.  Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday could have partied for a month in Milwaukee. They were on a plane to Tokyo as well.  Kevin Durant is the best basketballer on the planet (and, yeah, Im a bucks fan. Father time is undefeated, and the future belongs to Giannis. But right now ? Its KD). After a rough ECF loss where he left his heart on the court, he's there too.  So. They are all American athletes.  And as an Australian, I'm proud they are there. We will need to go through them for the gold medal, and there is no better way than to face the best."
"Team USA has been on the rise since their first loss in the opening game against France.  Kevin Durant is in MVP mode and he led this team to victory against a Spanish team that is too dependent on Ricky Rubio.  He had a huge game with 38 points, but in the end, he was all alone.  The scoring was more evenly distributed for the Americans and that made the difference.  I got a better look at Garuba in this game. He is really frustrated on offense. There will be a lot of development work to do with him so he can really establish himself in the NBA as a role player."
A little touch and go in the 2nd; everything was falling for the spaniards.  But the US stemmed the bleeding and in the 3rd pushed the pace and got hot.  Thank god this team has Kevin Durant.
I’ll be watching the Gold medal match to see if Kevin Durant can retire from the Olympics with 400 career points. That would be a first in history.
"Not 4x Scoring Champion, MVP, 2x FMVP Kevin Durant..."

"**2004:** Dwight Howard, Andre Iguodala.  **2005:** Chris Paul, Lou Williams.  **2006:** LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo, PJ Tucker, Paul Millsap.  **2007:** Kevin Durant, Al Horford, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Thad Young, Jared Dudley, Marc Gasol.  **2008:** Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Danilo Gallinari, Eric Gordon, DJ Augustin, Brook Lopez, Robin Lopez, JaVale McGee, Serge Ibaka, Nicolas Batum, George Hill, DeAndre Jordan, Goran Dragic.   2009 with James Harden and Steph Curry is probably the end point?"
"Didn\`t it all start when he had that put back dunk against McGee/Durant during the GSW game that Kevin Harlan was calling? Luke was still the coach during that time. He had good games here and there but I think that dunk started his fame outside the laker fanbase. In terms of being taken seriously though, it was during Vogel."
Why doesn't EVERYONE simply become Kevin Durant ?
Why doesn't Kristaps Porzingis simply become Kevin Durant
Harden is on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
"It's called a dip and it's not as awful as people on here are saying. It's understandable because coaches go crazy over this. It's a rhythm thing. Players who dip before shooting:   * Steph Curry  * Bradley Beal  * JJ Redick * Jayson Tatum * Kevin Durant * Klay Thompson * Fred VanFleet   Should I go on? It doesn't slow the shot down. I don't understand the logic behind why it's bad. You still have to bend your knees and the dip motion happens simultaneously with the lower body. By the time you raise up to shoot, the ball is coming out an the top of the jump."
"After Kevin Durant got to make up his own nickname, we should never let them get that choice again."
"&gt; Lol everyone knows pippen made garbage pay.  MJ's contract was a smaller percentage of the cap than Curry's bad ankles contract. He was making 3.8 mil to Scottie's 2.9.   &gt;And anyways, Jordan didn’t go and team up with magic and bird so your point is irrelevant. Lebron was the OG Kevin Durant  MJ made an agreement to join the 57-25 Knicks and gave the Bulls 24 hours to match. MJ was the OG Kevin Durant, the Bulls just paid him more than the salary cap to stay.   Also, the NBA was willing to let the Knicks pay MJ 15/mil a year in endorsements outside the salary cap. The league itself signed off on MJ breaking the competitive balance. MJ was great, but he's not whatever ideal of competition you've made him out to be. Cry fucking more and/or keep jerking off to your myths."
"Lol everyone knows pippen made garbage pay. And anyways, Jordan didn’t go and team up with magic and bird so your point is irrelevant. Lebron was the OG Kevin Durant"
and Kevin Durant said he didn't like the Slim Reaper despite that being one of the best nicknames ever
"I remember watching the opening ceremonies for the '08 Olympics, seeing Lebron walk out and my buddy standing next to TV like a weather man and saying ""Bron Bron is going bald bald"", while pointing at his fading hairline.  I also, for some reason, remember watching an OKC playoff game about 7-8 years ago when my friend said, ""Wait, is Kevin Durant balding?""  Not sure why I remember this, but you can't hide the fact that your balding on camera unless maybe your in some bad lighting. Especially if it's live TV since live broadcasts tend to have super bright lighting."
"Kevin Durant has slightly better stats on slightly higher effeciency, but what really puts him over Curry is that he is a really good defender, unlike Curry who is average to negative, but you are right that they aren't that far apart."
Kevin Durant and James Harden to the Celtics  Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson to the Nets  And we both give a second round pick to the Wizards because we feel bad.
"He’s actually an incredible finisher. He’s shooting 66% from 0-3 feet, which is almost exactly the same percentage as Kevin Durant in his second year and better than Giannis in his second year. He’s a very solid 1v1 defender but, like most young players, he needs to work on his team defense. Also his size, strength, and freakish wingspan give him a lot of versatility on defense(he’s built just like PJ Tucker)."
"Sure, but that's like saying it's easier for Kevin Durant to get a shot off than Steph Curry so that makes him a better shooter.   Luka and Trae have been in the league for 3 years. In their rookie years, Trae put up 12 assists/100 possessions to Luka's 9/100. In their sophomore years, Trae put up 12.3/100 to Luka's 12.7/100, despite Trae playing with arguably the worst supporting cast in the league.  Now, this year, Trae's putting up 12.9/100 to Luka's 13.1/100.   Their turnover numbers have been comparable all 3 seasons too, Rookie: Trae 5.7/100 to Luka 5.2/100, Sophomore: Trae 6.4/100 to Luka 6.1/100, and now: Trae 6.1/100 to Luka 5.7/100.  I don't think you can just decide to knock someone because your eye says they're working harder if they're executing at the same level.   From my eye, Trae draws infinitely more defensive attention than Luka, so his being able to execute at the level he does is even more impressive. His game against Dallas was the most defensive attention I've ever seen a player given. Full court pressed all game, the man assigned to him played hard ball denial when he was off the ball, and then whenever he caught the ball in the half-court he got doubled."
"Lol kevin durant is never not a good choice. He's a lanky 7 footer who can shoot the lights out, he's a good fit with anyone.  It's not like AI was an incredible shooter himself so him and giannis could have some serious spacing issues"
Why were Kevin Durant and kyrie attracted to the nets. Kawhi and Paul George to the clippers. Being in new York and La matters a lot.
"The last few minutes of this game had incredibly fun line ups featuring Marcus morris &amp; kevin durant at the 5. The skill level both teams featured in these 5 man line ups was incredible. The Clippers are a very formidable shooting team, but I struggle to imagine they are the best ever even thought they are on pace to match the '16 GSW from 3 (41.6%). They are very dependent on that 3 ball going in as they consistent lack a punch at the rim besides Zu. PG, RJ, &amp; Lou are just not the young pups they used to be who could get to the rim at will &amp; finish or get fouled. Thru 22 games their tipping point is 43% from 3, in that they are 11-1 when they shoot above that &amp; 6-5 when they shoot below that. It will be interesting to see how Ty Lue starts manufacturing offense if their jumpers stops falling at the rate they need them to. Perhaps they will begin tightening up their defense to make up the difference which is middle of the pack at the moment but capable of being top 5 given the personnel."
such a fucking classic stupid ass Bill statement comparing Kevin Durant to Kevin Love. Just so unneccesary
"Yes, he was playing well but not 70M well.    That contract was more of a “show Kevin Durant we’re not actually cheap” contract, given out the final year before Durant’s contract expired in an attempt to lock up key players to demonstrate to Durant that they were willing to go all in to win the championship.    I often laugh at how much money they spent during this time (they even went into the luxury tax for Dion freaking Waiters) to show that they weren’t cheap, all because they actually *were* cheap when it came to James Harden.     In the end they paid about 4x as much as they would’ve paid Harden in bloated contracts for role players and luxury tax fees, and Durant left anyway."
or barnes to fucking kevin durant
How about…Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant
Almost like going from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant.
compared to the entire city of Toronto cheering when Kevin Durant injured himself? yeah okay buddy kindly fuck off lmao
I like those tho. Miss our our fuck steph curry and fuck Kevin Durant by lil b blaring in the playoffs.
Second greatest Thunder ever is Kevin Durant   The second best player to play in a Thunder jersey is Westbrook
Kevin Durant has been a paint presence for years. Him and Serge Ibaka used to be the best paint defense duo in the league. People really just forget his early thunder years where he was top 5 in blocks per game year after year.
The only redditor that could do that is Kevin Durant
"Devin Booker, I was nuetral on the suns but dude can really ball out  Jo Morant seems like he can only go up, I'd be so mad at the universe if he reached his ceiling early. I know in life you should manage expectations but I see him being a super star   Harden, never saw him play too much and was infamous for flopoing but maaan during that time he was in the top 5 mvp race he was looking lethal. Harden was just steam rolling through the league, that west coast road trip where they beat everyone was spooky cos every win you could just add **they're missing kevin durant tho** felt like the opening scene of a horror movie, truly scary hours"
Kevin Durant did.
- Kevin Durant: Worse - Kyrie: Better - Harden: Better
"Kevin ""I'm not a tsundere b-baka"" Durant"
Kevin “It’s not like I’m defending you because I like you or anything” Durant
"Hilarious how last years ring went from the hardest and realest ring anyone can win, with even Kevin Durant saying this would be the most impressive ring in NBA history, to a Mickey Mouse ring."
"Probably what happened it’s just a meme, Kevin Durant saw a meme just like this and he said he was dying when he saw it"
&gt;Kevin Durant (Thunder)  The Westbrook slander continues lol.  Ask anyone in OKC who the greatest franchises player in Thunder history and everyone tells you its Russ.  Terrible dude.
Can this team make the finals?  Steph Curry/Chris Paul  Michael Jordan/Kobe Bryant  Lebron James/Larry Bird   Kevin Durant/Kevin Garnett  Hakeem Olajuwon/Shaq
That fan? Kevin Durant.
What do you make of this? https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/09/why-kevin-durant-will-be-the-greatest-scorer-in-nba-history
They don't have Kevin Durant?   Also if you haven't given up on the Wizards by now you're a moron or just don't simply understand basketball   Tell me how the Wizards can win having a net negative as their starting point guard and having the same defensive strategy as traffic cones?

"41% on 2 less attempts a game.  Steph Curry creates his own shots, his off ball movements to get open looks is unparalleled. I love Klay, but he benefited greatly from the gravity of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant generating open looks for him. I severely doubt his ability to shoot that effectively as the number 1 option of a team."
"Yes, I am serious. How is he a whole step above Kevin Durant?"
"The article is somehow worse than the headline.  &gt; It would be one thing if Golden State still had Kevin Durant. He was a big reason why the Warriors made five straight trips to the Finals in the glory days. Durant, almost single-handedly, won two of their three championships during his three seasons in the Bay. &gt;  &gt; Remember, Durant, not Curry, was the Finals MVP in the Warriors’ last two titles. Curry, without Durant, was the author of the biggest choke job in NBA Finals’ history."
"Didn't he break his foot 2 months ago? That'd be a crazy quick return.   That's the injury that made Brook Lopez and Kevin Durant miss entire seasons. Matter of fact, both Lopez and Durant tried to come back early but ended up re-aggravating the injury IIRC."
Kevin Durant made Scott Brooks COTY the very next season. The end.
"I can care less they are not my teams. Defense wins championships not offense. You should know that. But Bev on Luka is not the answer. That’s suicide, I mean even Luka was yelling don’t switch. Lol. Doc Rivers tried guarding KD with Bev, how did that workout? He’s Kevin fucking Durant."
They became toxic before the season even started with no history of winning lmao. I’ve legitimately never seen that before in a fan base.  Warriors fans were less annoying when they signed fucking Kevin Durant. How is that possible?!
Because he's not Kevin Durant.
"KD has always been 1B (to 1A Lebron) in the league since forever. He was even looking like he was THE best player in the league before he went down in GS. He got hurt and missed a year, but he’s still the better player IMO.  As great as Curry is, he’s no Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant is probably the best offensive player in modern NBA history, I don’t see how you could pick anybody else."
Kevin Durant top 5 my white ass
"The model is biased because of the Lebron effect.  The original model (elo) was bad at predicting the Lebron's Cavs. so they added playoff experience to the model and also added categories (Carmelo) for all players which affect things greatly. Clippers have playoff experience and two players in the top two categories (mvp/all-star).  Nets are not that high because Durant is only a ""Key role player""  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/kevin-durant/"
"Kevin  ""Jon Jones"" Durant"
I can Google Kevin Durant and Kyrie's thought process?
https://youtu.be/3ZqgM4H8oM4 his best play as a Laker was a preseason chasedown block of a Kevin Durant alley oop.
"They did not win 73 games out of pure luck. They were genuinely one of the best teams ever, even before Kevin came. even if you feel it’s common sense, it’s still not reality. It didn’t happen. we can go back-and-forth all day, the fact of the matter is curry won a championship and MVPs without Durant. He would still be an all timer without him."

"Let's be real, it makes the nets super stacked. Harden was a one man conference finals booking and you let him join Kevin fucking durant and Kyrie"
"Why? Kevin Durant is a 7 foot guard and one of the greatest scorers ever and good defensively. If we're going purely by peak, Durant legitimately has a case to be top 10 ever already, as at his offensive peak, he's completely unguardable, similar to Jordan and LeBron and every other great   Regardless, GOAT rankings are done by career accolades, you're measuring careers not greatest peaks ever."
"It doesnt matter about the overall offensive games of each player, all that matters is Steph and Klay, being the 2 greatest shooters in history, completely warped defences to their mercies and left one of the greatest iso scorers of all time, Kevin Durant, with wide open shots. The nets team now relies on the isolation brilliance of the big 3, which is still incredibly effective with these guys, but can take your role players out of rhythym."
LeBron is an illiterate version of Kevin Durant tbh
Comments like this are so dumb lmfao. Did you expect the fans to cower down in fear of Lord Kevin Durant and vote to forfeit from the playoffs?
BREAKING: Tony La Russa: Kevin Durant should be ashamed of himself for blocking a player on a layup attempt in a blowout win.
Booker is just a smaller Kevin Durant
It's great to have him back. Not my favorite guy but such a smooth scorer.   He's Kevin Durant. Y'all know who he is
The KD warriors was the funniest one. People honestly thought replacing the worst starter on the Warriors with Kevin fucking Durant wasnt gonna work
"a better player cant join a lesser player? there is a reason kd was the one winning the finals mvps when they were together. and just to quote kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."" also he once said “I would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he’s the most talented basketball player I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kerr said.  “It was more just a level of basketball that I’m not sure had ever been reached before.”"

Just work hard Nesmith and you could be as good as Kevin Durant. Pritchard could definitely become the next Harden if he would just dedicate himself to the game
Can we please have a Nets game without Kevin Durant almost dying
"""kevin durant, one of the great competitors of the game"" lmao what"

He won more there than anywhere else and your post reeks of hindsight bias. They could've improved and were a good team.  This is the exact same kinda mentality that validates Kevin Durant leaving the thunder.
Bill Russell is one of the most overrated players of all time and I’m glad you feel the same way. It’s a joke that he’s consistently ranked as a top 10 player. Kevin Durant deserves a top 10 spot over him
"Lol so I could develop dribble/handling as good as Trae Young because I haven't played basketball since high school? Why not simply draft a high schooler at 45th and just teach them how to dribble like Trae, right? draft cheat code  There is such a thing as skill and talent in different facets of the game. If you can expect MPJ to learn to dribble at an elite level as a freaking seven-footer (there is literally only one seven footer in the league with elite handles and his name is Kevin Durant, btw), you should also expect to just be able to teach Trae Young good defense as a 6'1 guard with average wingspan, right? Handling and playmaking are genuinely just not in MPJ's skillset and that's just the way it is. Why not just teach Shaq to shoot free throws and teach Simmons to hit threes? Shit doesn't just work like that"

Are we talking this current life or the past life where KAI was literally Kevin Durant?  Because it’s different in both lives.
Kevin Durant
"Holding him to 9-22 FG, 1-6 3PT is getting cooked?   Last year in the playoffs Kawhi went off but not against Kleber. According to Second Spectrum, there have been 17 different occasions where an opponent has defended Kawhi on at least 100 half-court positions in a playoff series. (Since 2013-14, which is when tracking began.) Kleber in last year's playoffs held Kawhi to his third-lowest effective field goal percentage (41.4) among that group, behind only Malcolm Brogdon in 2019's Eastern Conference Finals (34.5) and Kevin Durant in the 2013-14 Western Conference Finals (39.7).   The other Mav who has spent a bunch of time on Kawhi in that series was Dorian Finney-Smith, and he got torched: Kawhi had 30 points on 66 half-court matchups with DFS, compared with 44 on 115 matchups with Kleber. His eFG% against DFS is 63.2%, which dwarfs the figure he has posted against Kleber as well.  Kawhi is a top 10 player in the league and will obviously find a way to score, but Maxi is making it as hard as anyone else for Kawhi to score."
"What a bunch of horse shit. Stop posting.  https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-on-if-the-warriors-mishandled-his-calf-injury-hell-no-211347829.html  &gt; So we got straight to it. Did the Warriors mishandle the injury?  &gt; Durant slowly straightened up with a perplexed expression on his face.  &gt; “Hell, no. How can you blame [the Warriors]? Hell, no,” Durant told Yahoo Sports. “I heard the Warriors pressured me into getting back. Nobody never said a word to me during rehab as I was coming back. It was only me and [director of sports medicine and performance] Rick [Celebrini] working out every day. Right when the series started, I targeted Game 5. Hell, nah. It just happened. It’s basketball. S--- happens. Nobody was responsible for it. It was just the game. We just need to move on from that s--- because I’m going to be back playing.”"
"Anyone with revisionist history in regards to the Heat should get out lol. They were viewed like the Kevin Durant GS Warriors at the time. Well all thought they were just gonna blow everyone out and win 3 rings in a row. Dirk and co. put a stop to that train early on, especially because Lebron choked super hard. He definitely grew and became clutch af because of it though."

Will be able to score it a little, but will be so bad elsewhere on the floor that he'll lack the minutes to score significantly.""  &amp;#x200B;  That has to count as ""incredibly incorrect,"" right?"
"Kevin Durant 2018-2019, most recently"
"You’d think Kevin Durant or Yao Ming was writing the article, because holy hell this is an insane reach"
"What’s stopping every tall, skinny wing from being Kevin Durant?"
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
"Kevin Durant   If I lose, it’s to the best"
Kevin Durant is technically a PF this season true?
"Hm. I think Gordon Hayward, Goran Dragic, Payton Pritchard, ~~Tyler Herro~~, Duncan Robinson, Cody Zeller, and Doug McDermott are more similar to Larry Bird than Kevin Durant is."
&gt; he should be the runaway MVP favorite  He won't get considered because his team mates are Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"I knew someone was going to mention that.   It was a terrible &amp; uncomfortable joke. It's not like he said ""Fuck Kevin Durant. He ain't getting shit""."
Kevin Durant
Ok. So Bradley Beal is better than Kevin Durant then.
"No. For the simple reason that Paul could have done the same.   New Orleans Paul playing with LeBron + Love and then LAC Paul playing with Durant + Harden is very likely winning a couple of rings as well.  As a comparison, Kevin Garnett has fewer rings than Bosh, but KG would have massacred the league if he had Bosh's teammates."
"Yes but not actually. There's far more of a gap if you've ever seen them in the floor together  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2020/7/6/21314643/frank-vogel-lebron-james-anthony-davis-wants-lakers-dominate-orlando  Just look at that first photo, is AD on a platform? Cuz thats like a 3 inch difference.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1219176-2012-nba-finals-lebron-james-versus-kevin-durant-is-just-what-the-nba-needs  Or that one of KD and Bron, I've seen an inch difference and that ain't it"
Kevin Durant: wishes to spend rest of career in OKC  Kevin Durant: proceeds to leave OKC to build a super team in Golden State the upcoming offseason
"I mean Kevin Durant had the same achilles injury and he's cooking in the games he's played. And Klay relies on way less athleticism than KD.   Klay has had the back to back injuries which is worrisome, but we've seen guys come back and still play at an elite level. We wont know til it happens."
"I mean bro, Lakers are a strong team, but not a super team. We don’t have three absolute stars, just two.   If you told someone that the nets would have Kevin Durant, Kylie Irving, James Harden, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan with Steve Nash fucking coaching them they wouldn’t believe it. They probably would try to send David Stern into the future to stop it."
Kevin Durant?
"He signed for 4 years 44 million and his ankle issues were so bad that NBA media thought they gave him too big of a contract. For comparison, from the same draft, Blake Griffin’s first new contract was 5 years 95 million.   The cap spike played a huge part of course but yeah this literally allowed them to sign Kevin Durant."
"Remember when Kevin Durant liked a post about anti-semite and human filth Louis Farrahkan? Yeah fuck KD and fuck Scott Foster, too."
"James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook  The first basketball I watched was the OKC 3"
When coaches game plan do they say “okay guys today our game plan is to stop James harden!” No. They say “okay our game plan is going to be trying to stop James harden Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving.”  Edit: and harder shots?? That’s just straight false
I fuckin hate to say it but ain’t nobody beating this Nets team 4 games out of 7  Not to mention they still have Kevin fucking Durant coming back
I know we’re playing some of our worst defense this season so far.. but this Nets offense is ridiculous. Now add fucking Kevin Durant... unstoppable.  For me they have to be the clear favourites at this stage for the title.
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"Stephen curry, Lebron, Kobe, Garnett, Duncan, Shaq, Kevin Durant. So basically, Iv seen what some people consider to be half of the greatest peaks of all time"
"It depends on how you define things.  If Embiid wins MVP and takes his team to the Finals, we could see his career as being on par with Kevin Durant when he was with OKC.  Now, imagine if Embiid wins MVP, a few championships with the team that drafted him, and DPOY, I think it'd be fair to say that resume surpasses KD's career.  That was where Greg Oden was projected to go.    Until this season, people have forgotten what a superstar big man can do during their prime years.  Oden was projected to have that offensive capability that Jokic and Embiid have demonstrated while also being a perennial DPOY.    All that with elite athleticism and point guard skills (ex. during NBA Combine, he was faster than Mike Conley and could keep up with point guards during dribbling drills).  It's very much possible."
"Eh, I'd say he's been close to KD's level. Jimmy's PER is higher at 26.2 to 25.3. Jimmy puts up 21.4/8.0/7.4 and Durant puts up 29/5.3/7.3. Jimmy has an ORTG of 123 to Durant's 120. Durant is obviously a more efficient scorer, but also turns it over way more and doesn't get nearly as many assists. And it's of note that Jimmy is playing 2 fewer MPG so his triple slash line is a bit diminished because of that.  And I feel like it would be hard to argue that Jimmy isn't the better defender. Am I saying that Jimmy is as good a player as Kevin Durant? No. But I don't think he's nearly as far off as the weight their names carry."
"I was curious who the 17 are:  LeBron James (LAL)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Giannis antentekuonmpo (MIL)  Luka Doncic (DAL)  James Harden (BKN)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Paul George (LAC)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Kevin Durant (BKN)  Russel Westbrook (WSH)  kawhi Leonard (LAC)  DeAndre Jordan (BKN)  Marc Gasol (LAL)  Chris Paul (PHX)  Dwight Howard (PHI)  Derrick Rose (NYK)  So 3 Lakers, 3 nets, 2 clippers and a Knick."
"As far as teams that won a lot I feel like the Jordan Bulls and the showtime Lakers are probably the most likeable dynasties in NBA history, not that they didn't have their haters but still        The 2014 Spurs come to mind, there was enough gap between the other titles they had won and I think there was enough Collective heartbreak from how game 6 and 7 had ended the previous year even if you weren't a huge Spurs fan, the very young Kevin Durant / Westbrook / Harden Thunder, the Charlotte Hornets of the 90s, the recent grit-and-grind Memphis Grizzlies we're also very likable obviously as mentioned earlier we got a great game 6 and 7 out of that finals but I've always been curious how that team would have done against the Heat that year        I also feel like the 20 14/15 warriors were very liked but I don't think a lot of people like that they won the championship"
"Bad Boy Pistons for sure, the Heatles, the Kevin Durant Warriors, I would say the 2008 Celtics have become retroactively disliked, and I can't speak to it for sure but I'm sure there was a lot of basketball fans in the 1960s who are fucking annoyed at the Celtics winning as much as they did"
"Kevin Durant, until further notice. need to see him play a playoff series, and lose, without being injured while playing, to change my mind.  Third is Giannis, Jokic, Dame, Luka, Embiid, AD, CP3, Beal, Harden, etc. Have at it."
Because Mason Plumlee is the Black Kevin Durant
"It's not like he's always playing on a stacked team, Kevin Durant has missed more games than he's played and Kyrie Irving missed a little over 1/4 of the Nets' games.  He definitely has an easier situation, but he's still been the biggest driving force in the Nets' success."
Kevin “Durant” Knox
"EPM is from the old RPM creator and he basically uses a very similar form to it now it's very tried true and solid.   LEBRON publicly publishes all its methodology and its box score prior and also uses luck adjusted data for on/off. It's kind of just a modified version of PIPM that specifically incorporates player roles better which was needed.   RAPTOR incorporates player tracking data which it's still very much tbd on what/if any of it actually helps create a more stable and valid model year to year(using too much playtracking data is part of what screwed up RPM). There are just all kinds of face validity basic tests it fails on top of that. Ex Conley has shared basically &gt;90% of his minutes with Gobert this year if your model cant isolate the defensive impact of Conley from Gobert then your model isnt doing a very good job. Sure enough that's what's happening, Conley has the 7th highest DRAPTOR which is comically high he's fine he's nowhere near that impactful defensively teams like the Heat have targeted him in games this yr. Better models like LEBRON do. Not making proper adjustments for player role is also how you end up with things like Jordan Clarkson having a higher offensive RAPTOR than Kevin Durant."
I remember a young Kevin Durant that used to be soft-spoken and humble like Anthony here.
2 weeks later: The Nets are being very cautious with the ramp-up of Kevin Durant (left hamstring strain) - meaning he's likely to miss one or two months
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant would absolutely have been made to bulk up to play the 4 and be an injury risk from day 1 after having stayed at Texas for two more years. James Harden would be made to play off ball two with his creativity restricted to mid range jumpers. Every NBA owner of 1990s is just as dumb as the OKC owner who traded him for peanuts. The real statement is can you imagine if the NBA had decision makers like Darryl Morey in the 90s. The NBA had a very tough time transitioning from a big man’s league. 1999-2007 are some dark days. Harden and Durant are lucky to have hit the league when they did in alot of regards.
Kevin Durant. I thought he was going to be a Sonic.
That would've been a Kevin Durant tier pussy move.
2015 16 Warriors could've won a championship if they had Kevin Durant
"Current superstars would have hard time in 90s.   Dude, can you imagine how what havoc would James Harden and Kevin Durant wreck if they’re never double-teamed thanks to illegal defense rule."

"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
"&gt; So heres whats up: conventional wisdom of the past few years is that Kevin Durant infinitely improved his shot quality while in Golden State. It had gone so far that people began discounting his stats.  Idk, I feel like the reason people discounted his stats and anything else he did like winning rings was cause they were such the ultimate superteam that basically it was a pick your poison defense teams had to do."
So you think Ben Simmons is scarier than Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant cause I love how he plays
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant open shots frequency in 2016 in OKC- 37%  Kevin Durant open shot frequency in 2017 in GSW- 36%  In the Finals - 27%   Things people don’t want to acknowledge though
"MPJ could definitely be scoring champ. I think he could have a career trajectory similar to Harden. He doesn't have the ability to convince refs to give him free throws just because he's next to someone yet, but he is one of the more natural/effortless looking scorers I've ever seen. I'm not saying he's as good as a Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, but I am saying he has that same effortless look when he's getting buckets. Like, he doesn't even look pressed or stressed or anything.. I said it before and I'll s ay it again.. I fully believe MPJ could average 30ppg over an 82 game season eventually. Like within the next 2 years even. Truly a great pick by the Nuggets."
Steph by far. Show me another superstar that can consistently get Kevin Durant open shots just by existing.
kevin durant?
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant and James harden have played a total of **5** games together
1. I think the overall 3pt% improvement is due to players perceive the rim better with a static background behind it instead of a wave of fans.   2. The players on this this list with the highest % of 3 pointers -unassisted- are:  1. Zach Lavine (48.8% UA)  2. Mike Conley (41.7 UA) 3. CJ McCollum (39.7% 3PUA) 4. Kevin Durant (38.8% 3PUA) 5. Paul George (35.7% 3PUA)  Lavine really stands out here with almost half of his 3s coming unassisted. CJ’s larger volume also means he’s hitting a higher total amount of unassisted 3s in total (hitting 1.9 per game vs Lavine’s 1.7)  To me these are the most impressive shooters on the list. The ability to spot up from 3 unassisted is the most lethal skill out there and you can feel it when those players have the ball.
"Such snowflakes they are. What kind of weird human are you that you need only LeBron James to tell you to get a vaccine. Not Kevin Durant, not James harden, not Steph Curry. But only lebron? Weird motherfuckers."
Kevin Durant baybee
"There's a massive difference between saying that stats are misleading and saying that stats don't matter. Looking at TS% and PPG randomly would make you believe that Anthony Davis is the 2nd greatest playoff scorer to Michael Jordan, which is untrue, however ignoring stats would mean that you wouldn't recognize Davis as a great scorer at all.  Looking at stats without any context would land you at thinking that LeBron James is as good as a scorer as Kevin Durant or that Karl Malone was a better scorer than Kobe Bryant and Larry Bird, which are asinine thoughts and the reason you have to actually THINK and watch the games before making a stupid conclusion."
"&gt;  I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Fair enough.  It seemed like you were making that implication, but if you're not I appreciate the clarification.  &gt;  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics. It's true I didn't watch him on the Bucks, but on the Celtics, he wasn't being double teamed regularly.  None of his years with the Celtics were close.  His years with the Sonics were much, much better, although the end of his Bucks tenure was solid (minus when he basically got replaced by Michael Redd).  &gt;  Also wtf, you claim Lillard has McCollum to prevent him from being double teamed? I think you are the one who does watch Lillard enough. Even with a healthy McCollum Lillard still gets double teamed on most plays. Go watch any series against where the Warriors beat the Blazers.  I can flat out promise you I've watched more Lillard than you have.  I was a few years above him on the same AAU squad, I watched him dominate from very young all the way through Alameda and have been a huge fan of his for his entire career.  The Warriors almost never double teamed Lillard.  Zone trap is not the same as double team, and Lillard purposefully drove into extra defenders so he could move the ball and work the 4v3.  Lillard purposefully driving into an occupied area of a zone to force more defenders on him and make a teammate open is not the same as shooting against a double team.  Lillard is almost always guarded by Klay 1v1 when they play the Warriors.  &gt;  Also I am a Blazers fan and a big fan of Dame, but this has nothing to do with that. Here is a list of players I also think are better shooters than Allen. Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, obviously Steph.  Dude....this is just bad.  Really bad.  Trae Young isn't even a top 10 shooter in the NBA right now.  Just because he has highlights hitting 35 footers doesn't mean he didn't miss 10 before he made that.  His shot selection is piss poor and his percentages are worse.  Not that that's the end all, and he is a talented player, but he's just not a very good shooter.  Damn the disrespect to an all time great here is savage.  Not one of those people besides Steph is a better shooter than Ray.  &gt;  I simply value the ability to create your own shot more than I value the ability to catch and shoot.  Then it might interest you to learn that Ray shot a better percentage on 3's he created than any of the people you listed in the last paragraph and Dame.  The fact that Ray Allen was shooting 40% regularly in an NBA that didn't value the 3 and would bench you for shooting off the dribble is insane.  Devaluing his accomplishments just because we're not qualifying them with context is a huge mistake."
"I didn't even call you unsophisticated, only people who just want to flat out compare numbers.  Also idk what you consider prime Ray Allen, Bucks or Celtics.

"Oh not sure if you know, they also have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving"
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokić|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Dončić|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"It’s cause he was considered #2 behind lebron even when he was in OKC. He even got tired of being  #2  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  “The Oklahoma City Thunder superstar receives plenty of recognition and praise for what he can do, but there's always someone ahead him. LeBron James, the Miami Heat and even Greg Oden have always been in front of him.”  And this was in 2013 lol"
Warrior's front office convincing Kevin Durant to go there after the WCF
"Actually no, people forget (I blame KD joining GS) but teams have been doubling Steph for a long time now. Steph has been pretty much been drawing double teams all season long and even when Kevin fricking Durant was on the same team the defence would still focus more on Steph. In terms of gravity Steph is definitely the sun, he’s just that more lethal."
"Got a dark skin friend, play like Kevin Durant,  Got a light skin friend, play like Kevin Durant"
&gt; Finding a playmaking big guard to take the load off of Curry and Draymond as they age while also being a good shooter to space the floor is extremely hard.  The ball was taken out of Steph's hands because of Kevin Durant. They aren't going to do that again especially not for a rookie.   Ball is great and he'll continue to get better. But the Warriors already had a ball dominate guy who could shoot and playmake (d'lo) and they shipped him off knowing that Steph/Klay is the backcourt and Dray needs to run the O with Steph otherwise you don't get the best out of either one.
"The same Kevin Durant who has missed more than half of the season, and who has only played in 8 games with Harden?"
"Yeah, but think, add Kevin Durant and maybe they go 13-0 instead of 12-1. Big difference"
"That doesn’t matter, like at all, he has Kevin Durant on his team, they won’t give him MVP"
Why were other NBA fanbases complaining about the Warriors superteam when they had just as good of an opportunity to sign Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant hasn't played in a month also.
How the fuck can you win MVP in a season when 1. You publicly take a dump on your team and force them to trade you 2. You're playing on the same team as Kevin Durant AND Kyrie Irving  It's stupid.
"And then there was the additional effect that it had on a certain player on the team.  After having seen his best friend, James Harden, shipped out a few years prior, Kevin Durant now watched another good friend and valuable player getting let go a year before his next big payday.  It prompted him to believe that the remaining cats were incapable of winning a Championship and ushered him out the door in FA to create a superteam in the Bay that destroyed parity in the NBA for several seasons to come."
Kevin Durant.
"First of all, there have only been 7 awards since his last MVP, and they are:  Kevin Durant (13-14) Curry 2x (14-15, 15-16) Westbrook (oops) Harden (17-18) Giannis 2x (18-19, 19-20)  Not sure how you take any of those away. Even the RWB year, Harden and Kawhi were right there.  13-14 was a nice LBJ year but Durant averaged **32** on 56% eFG%. 17-18 was also great, but again, Harden was absolutely deserving. In 18-19, he didn't even make the playoffs, so that's obviously out. The Curry years were statistically some of LeBron's least impressive seasons.  He definitely had a case to be MVP several of those seasons, but it's just not ""stupid"" that other guys won."
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;they also didn't have kevin durant.    Just like the last 11 games.
"I think a lot of it, too, is his personality doesn't work well for someone who's contentious, like an SAS or Ben Shapiro.  I get in many arguments/debates myself, but I often have the patience to address nuance, and I'm willing to put the research in where we're arguing about researchable information, and sometimes admit my original opinion was wrong; if you're not up for doing these things, I would strongly advise to generally avoid arguments.  It's clear to me that Kevin Durant doesn't have that temperament, and in fact can be pretty funny and charming while being laid back."
Those last 11 games were without Kevin Durant
"I mean it’s alright to be a realist and say they haven’t won a championship yet, but if that’s your description of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden immediately after, thats pretty disingenuous.   Good thing Embiid doesn’t have any injury or weight problems! Knockdown shooter in Ben, too."
He also had to play with Kevin freaking Durant and Russell Westbrook
"&gt;Ok, but that Rockets supporting cast was elite both offensively and defensively,  i sorta understand what you're saying, but at the same time, they also didn't have kevin durant. it's a tough sell."

Harden: 38  Kevin Durant: 35  Curry: 38 - 40  Lebron: 43  Kawhi: 34
"Kevin Durant also played against a young Steph Curry, which you never did, I actually believe a 12 year old Steph would beat you in a 1 on 1"
Kevin Durant is an internet person. With the fragility of an old lady. So sensitive
"We literally have film of middle school Steph shooting 3s in games, he was known for shooting 3s even as a child, a kid Durant played against him and said Steph was scary. But sure a internet person knows better than Kevin Durant"
"Yeah, it's only the same amount as Kevin Durant"
"They already did it though, and what is there to even trade for that would make them a contender anyways?  I don't think the Warriors or Steph are going to be losing sleep on what could have been, considering they already got to the top of the mountain.  And the Warriors gave Steph the most anyone could have wanted throughout his career, I mean, how many superstars were given Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant?
They'd have two of the three best players in the series against every team PLUS Kyrie Irving. Their defence might be trash but they have enough firepower to make up for it and then some. They're second in the East even with Kevin Durant missing half the season.
"Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Tim Duncan"
Kevin Knox and Kevin Durant
"The article highlights what any smart basketball fan who has watched the Bucks for years can see:   - Giannis is much more devastating as a play finisher than as a play creator, especially in crunch time situations at the end of games.   - Giannis on a championship team is a lot more like Anthony Davis than he is LeBron.   - When Giannis is the play creator on the team, he's a 7-foot Westbrook, which is an incredible player, but one that's got glaring flaws that will be exacerbated in a playoff setting.   - Bucks are better off letting Middleton and Jrue make decisions with the ball in their hands in late game situations than Giannis, Middleton is the best bucket gettor on the team, and Jrue is the best decision maker on the team. Middleton is the 2nd best decision maker on the team.   - The existential question for the Bucks now is are Middleton and Jrue good enough to be your primary creators on offense on a championship caliber team? Will Jrue Holiday be more aggressive on offense when it counts like you could argue he needs to be on this team? 2 player comps I would make, is Jrue Holiday is smaller Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton is smaller Kevin Durant."
The defensive issue I can accept in this series.   Kevin Durant is the most unguardable player in the NBA. Him and Curry.   Though he's not even putting a dent Durant's game.   But yeah... the offense? It's embarrassing. And the Nets aren't even a great defensive team.
Fuck we are struggling with Trae Young. No way we stop James Fucking Harden and Kevin Durant and Kyrie shiit
"I think in pure basketball ability, Kevin Durant maybe one of the 5 best players of all time, no joke.  In terms of accomplishments, accolades, and legacy, he’s around 10-15 in basketball greatness.  One way to think of it - I would have KD on my all time basketball starting 5, especially since he’s proven he can mesh with all time greats."
"Yeah I guess you have a point actually. 55/40/90 is a lot more exclusive than I would have thought. Literally the only members of that club is Kyrie Irving x1 and Stephen Curry x3.  On the flip side, setting it to just 50/40/90, but instead using 2P%, gives us the following:  Larry Bird x2  Mark Price x2  Reggie Miller x1  Chris Mullin x1  Peja Stojakovic x1  Steve Nash x4  Jose Calderon x1  Ray Allen x1 (I forgot to check minimums before saying he'd get like 4, my bad)  Kevin Durant x1  J.J. Redick x1  Stephen Curry x4  CJ McCollum x1  Kyrie Irving x2  Malcolm Brogdon x1  Khris Middleton x1  In retrospect and after remembering what the minimum makes are, I actually agree with you. I think this list covers it pretty well, with it being largely the same except for a couple newcomers, as well as Steph, Price, and Kyrie getting more of these seasons."
Who agreed to this assessment?  Did the world just forget Kevin Durant exists?

That doesn’t mean he more unguardable then Kevin Fucking Durant you bout lost your mind
They can get Kevin Durant and start making shots
Lol right? “Beyond Kyrie Irving and Kevin Fucking Durant this Nets team isn’t really all that talented”
Its a goddamn fever dream.   KEVIN DURANT IS A NET
"Look if Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving beats us by hitting open jumpers all day, I can live with that.  *loses by 40*"
I'm Kevin Durant.
"I think we're thinking that since the Bucks have Giannis, who is supposedly top 5 player in the game, we would see something ala Luka vs Clips or Lebron vs Dubs that a singular talent can match a super team.... except Kevin Durant is also top 5, and possibly Top 2 player in today's game...."
You can be named Kevin Durant
"1. Predictable offense 2. When one person gets the ball, nobody else cuts, they just stand there and watch them iso 3. No one is attacking Kevin Durant or Kyrie on defense."
Kevin Durant is the best player but it's a one series award so it could go to Joe Harris for all we know  Iguadala won a finals MVP
I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am.
Nets have some tall boi called Kevin Durant  Bucks decides to run a zone defense against said tall boi
"Bad defense by the Bucks and good defense by the Nets along with showtime Lakers-esque ball movement   Also, Kevin Durant"
It doesn’t help when DPOY UNICORN RIM PROTECTOR/PERIMETER LOCKDOWN Giannis Antetokounmpo decides to guard Mike James instead of Kevin Durant lmfao
Fam he’s guarding Kevin Durant. I don’t know what you want him to do about that
Then he’ll have the power of a grown Kevin Durant and a tiny bab…I mean Andy Wiggo.
"Bud is so gone, I cannot believe Pat fucking Connaughton is getting these minutes in playoff games. He knows this matters, right? Why is he running a 2-3 zone against one of the greatest outside shooting teams EVER? The Bucks don't stand a chance with Harden back unless they adjust somehow  Giannis is so bad at free throws at it makes me even more mad because he takes 10 years to shoot them  Kevin Durant might be the best player in the world it's really close at the top rn with no clear player pulling away"
"people are so ignorant here, it's so sad. do you watch the games? it was very clear last year that Giannis is not a top20 player in the playoffs. I discussed this with Giannis fans last year and here we are again. and just 2 days ago people were saying that the Bucks were clear favorites against the Nets without Harden!!! the Nets that have Kevin Fucking Durant, the best player in the playoffs right now, maybe the best player in the world actually. plus Irving who can score 30 points easily. how the Bucks could be favorites with a leader who can't shot? people don't understand how this game works..."
I’m Kevin Durant.
"The coach is supposed to set his team up for success and make quick adjustments based on the flow of the game.  For game 2, there isn't much he can do at this point to win the game, the team is getting outplayed in a number of key areas.  However, for the last 2 playoff runs under Bud, the Bucks have run a steady offense of ""Give Giannis the ball and let him go 1-5 whilst surrounded by shooters"", this strategy works in the regular season, but as we all know, in the playoffs the good teams will ""build a wall"", which shuts this strategy down.  Another issue with Bud is that he does not seem to adjust his minutes schedule much in the playoffs, I'm not going to go on about this issue in great detail because it's been covered on this subreddit a lot, other teams play there superstars 40 minutes+ in big series, whereas Bud keeps Giannis at sub 40 minutes in must-win games.  Lets go back to Game 1:-  The Bucks were crushing the Nets at Points in the paint, both Giannis and Lopez were dominating inside, Lopez was 8/11 from the field, and yet he played just 27 minutes. The 3 point shots were not falling for the bucks, so why not adjust your game plan and push more at whats working? Take the ball inside more on the nets where your bigs are hot.  Late in the third quarter, Kevin Durant gave up his fourth foul, he told Steve Nash to leave him in the game, and he did. The next few posessions, Durant was guarding Brook Lopez, someone he has trouble guarding in the post, the Bucks (Coach Bud) could have run a play to post Brook up on Durant and try to draw a foul and put him on his 5th foul heading into the fourth quarter, but no such adjustment was made.  These are the kinds of adjustments that great playoff coaches and championships team make, if the Bucks want to win a championship, I believe they'll need a better coach then Bud, who has had limited playoff success.  In my opinion, the biggest problems for the Bucks start with coaching. That being said, I do credit Bud for finally moving away from the ""Giannis 1-5 with 4 guys sitting on the wing strategy"" and putting the ball in the hands of Holiday and Middleton more.  I also don't understand why the Bucks don't run a few post up plays for Brook Lopez, the guy is still a GREAT post scorer, you could run 2 plays a quarter for him in the post and you'd probably get some great quality production, but instead they relegate to just sitting him on the perimeter. He is still effective, I just think they could get more out of him. The Nets would have trouble guarding Brook inside with his size and strength, especially when they are running a Griffin-Durant combo."
LeBron mops the floor with Kevin Durant stay mad bro
ELITE nets defense putting in work. Kevin durant is the real DPOY in my book

Kevin Durant just came back from an Achilles injury and is dominating
Kevin Durant. That is all.
Probably the easiest 30 mins of playoff basketball for Kevin Durant…what a beast
see my comment to the other guy--  &gt;switchign every time to shutdown star players is a fuckign pipedream. Kevin and Ky are getting whatever the fuck they want regardless what brook lopez does.  obviously playing drop against shooters is tough but kevin durant and kyrie irving will get their shots either way to a certain extent so its like shrug lets just do what we do?
"I have to dream, I cant just wake up and suddenly Kevin Durant shows up to my team"
&gt; Kevin Durant doing his thing by only competing with superstar teammates.   As a LeBron fan I'd be insane to hate on KD for this. We need to let this narrative go that championship teams don't have exceptional rosters led by exceptional players.
Why did I wake up and be a Blazers fan? Why couldn't I have been a fan of a team Kevin Durant plays for?
"Fuck Kevin Durant, man."
Y'all ever wish Kevin Durant would decide to come play for your team?
When kevin durant pulled up for that midrange jump shot it showed great ingenuity by steve nash
"It's a percentage of the cap.  They'll be fine. Superstars are a crazy deal, which is why they cap max salaries - market rate for guys like Lebron/Jokic/Luka/Durant would be more like 50-60% of the salary cap.  It's actually kind of a thing that fucks smaller market teams.  Everyone is going to spend their cap, but smaller market teams that can't attract free agents just have shittier max players. Klay and Kemba make almost as much as Lebron and Durant.   Here's a list of some players that make as much or more than Bradley Beal:  Steven Adams  Kevin Love  Blake Griffin  CJ McCollum  Kristaps Porzingis  Khris Middleton   It sucks when you're a smaller market team and you are paying the same amount for below-all-star level talent as your opponents do for generational talents."

Kevin Fucking Durant....my god.
kevin durant is a gd cheat code
"No one says he has to be Chuck or Zion in the post, but why can't he be at least as effective as KD? Here's some vids of KD scoring on post-ups:   - [Kevin Durant Post Scoring '18/19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-OR0w8gnWU)  - [Kevin Durant Post Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_muizwtF7w)  KD's not backing guys down with power moves. In the first video he can't even back down Jrue - so he just shoots over him.   There's no reason Porzingis can't do the same thing over Nic Batum. He should be able to get an uncontested 15-foot turnaround against any Clipper defender besides Zubac, any time he wants. But he doesn't want - he'd rather just sit in the corner and watch. He doesn't even roll to the high post off the P&amp;R like Bobi does."
Turns out that Kevin Durant really is the best player in the league this year.

"Ah yes, Kevin Durant, always takes the hardest path"
How do you attempt a comeback when Kevin Durant of all people is this hot?
Kevin durant is just too good
I'm pretty positive Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA
fire budenholzer at halftime and promote whatever assistant will make getting inside the focus  the complete lack of a paint focus against a team playing KEVIN DURANT AND BLAKE GRIFFIN AS THEIR BIGS is sabotage  trade middleton too. hes soft in the center and will always fail them

Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the NBA

"Buncha kids watched a Ben Taylor video and think that Jordan wasn't good at Defense.. probably the same ones who think Kevin Durant was only ever good in the Playoffs due to Steph's ""gravity"""
"I don’t understand how a player as talented and dominant as Kevin Durant comes across as so insecure, both in his personality and with the teams he’s chosen to join and help assemble. To be clear, I love watching him. But it seems like he doesn’t wanna be on a team unless it’s All-Time Talented, and I don’t think it’s necessary cause he’s good enough to win with less talented teams."

Kevin McHale Durant
"all week you talk about how the bucks are in this, this is gonna be the real finals, they match up well they have elite defenders top to bottom, jrue, giannis, nets dont play defense they should feast inside  and then you remember kevin durant hasnt actually lost a playoff series since he was in oklahoma city, unless you count the raptors finals where he played like one quarter and blew his achilles"
"Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers? That's cool and all, but we have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and that handsome fellow James Harden on the bench."
"As someone who was bullish on Kevin Durant's return:  1) The injury occurred in his non-dominant leg. This is very rare for an achilles tear as you usually are pushing off, more likely to injure your dominant leg. The other most prominent example of a player tearing their achilles on their dominant leg was Dominique Wilkins who had a very productive season after his injury.  2) He had a mega-long recovery time. His injury occurred on June 13, 2019 and he played his first official game post-injury on December 22, 2020. That is over 18 months as a result of an offseason, sitting out an entire season and then a delayed start to this year. Someone like Kobe tried to come back too soon. Durant was about as cautious and took it as slow as one could possibly do, and still took caution during the season.   3) Nature of his game - he can shoot over people forever. He doesn't need to be hyper athletic and just destroy people off the dribble in order to be effective. As he plays more and is able to trust his leg more, you see more of that returning, but he has never been reliant on it."
Kevin Durant tricked y'all
"Yes, casuals. Kevin Durant is still a cheat code."
Dubs should feel bad that they drove Kevin fucking Durant out of town
"He’s Kevin Durant, y’all know who he is"
"Much, much better shooter than either of them on much higher volume. Better touch.   Chris Paul is an all time player easily but Kevin Durant is arguably the greatest scorer of all time. Players like curry and Trae have shown that you can get it done without height."
"Ok, so how about the 1955 Championship? Does that deserve an asterisk? That was the first year with the 24-second shot clock, which was probably the biggest rule change in NBA history, so shouldn’t a season with that huge of an adjustment have an asterisk?  Same with the 1977 Championship won by the Blazers, right? That year, the NBA absorbed 4 ABA teams, resulting in an expansion of the league by 22% over its previous year’s total, a level of expansion not seen since the late 1940s, when the NBA was truly in its infancy, and the dissolution of the NBA’s competitor league, leading to a dispersal of talent that really has no comparison historically. This directly resulted in the two Finals teams acquiring hugely impactful stars from the ABA (Maurice Lucas to the Blazers, Dr. J. to the Sixers). This type of thing had never happened before or since, so obviously the Blazers deserve an asterisk, right?  We can probably cross off the 1994 Championship for the Rockets, too. The best player on the planet and reigning Finals MVP abruptly retired in his prime the previous offseason, which has never happened before and has obviously never happened since, so I’d say those count as abnormal circumstances, delegitimizing the Rockets’ ring, right?  The 1999 Spurs’ championship clearly deserves an asterisk as well since it was a shortened, 50-game season. Pretty unprecedented, so that doesn’t count. Same goes with the 2012 rings won by the Heat: another lockout season that definitely shouldn’t count, right?  The 2002 season saw a major rule change involving the elimination of illegal defense. This greatly altered the way the game was played and had a huge impact on how teams were built, so that probably doesn’t count either, right?  2015 for the Warriors is another one you can probably throw out the window. I mean, how many other times has the other NBA Finalist been missing its second and third best players? Those aren’t exactly what I’d call “normal circumstances,” so that’s an asterisk, according to you.  Same with the Warriors’ other rings in 2017 and 2018. They were only able to build that superteam thanks to a monumental cap spike the previous offseason that allowed them to sign Kevin Durant, so neither of those rings are legitimate, right?  You’ve already gone over 2020 and why that apparently doesn’t count, but let’s not forget 2021. The circumstances around this season have been anything but normal. Shortened offseason for certain teams, extra-long offseason for others, 72-game schedule packed into a shorter timeframe, players missing time due to coronavirus protocols, no fans for the regular season, inconsistent fan levels in the postseason, so this is obviously another ring that won’t count, according to you.  So there ya have it. The 1955, 1977, 1994, 1999, 2002, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 NBA Championships all don’t count since they have to be won under “normal circumstances” to count. We could probably find several more that also don’t count, but those are the main ones that popped into my head. So, do you agree that none of those rings count?"

"...idk, if you ask my mom if she knows Jordan Clarkson, she wouldn't have any idea, but if I ask her if she knows Kevin Durant or Lebron James or Steph Curry, she knows for sure."
"Man, people who dont watch the Timberwolves play at all and still bother to say these takes is ridiculous. Ant has a massive role which is carrying the offense, he has to take way more shots than the rest of the team due to them simply not being very good enough to score.  Its easy to be Haliburton and be the 3rd or 4th guy and you can average 10pts some dimes and that's it. Some of the most elite scorers in the NBA have been inefficient rookies and some even won ROY. Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, ect."
"Probably because we’re actually decent this year and have won some games against good teams. Also correct me if I’m wrong but I’m pretty sure the last 4 or 5 games we lost were all within 2-5 points at the end. So it’s not like we’re getting blown out even by great teams like Brooklyn and philly who we’ve played a lot recently. So not overrated I don’t think, plus most of this shit doesn’t matter because we all know who’s gonna be in the finals this year so unless you have Lebron James or Kevin Durant on your team your chances are looking slim"

"The biggest mismatch for us not including the Bucks and Sixers are the Bulls, the Nets biggest weakness is sharp shooting 5's and Vuc is a certified Nets killer.  I'm not dismissing the Knicks defense, but you do realize the Nets had 5 players out this game right... and two of those guys are Kevin Durant and James Harden. Our best and biggest win over the Knicks was with just Durant right after the Harden trade and Kyrie on his sabbatical. If they let up this many points to the hobbled skeleton Nets, it's definitely not gonna be better when the Nets are healthy."

you havent watched the nba for all-time if you think an all-star big -&gt; mvp caliber big is one of the biggest differentials of all-time haha  we see bigger literally every season. harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. way bigger difference
yeah it's obviously a big difference.. one of the biggest of all-time? no lol. an all-star to an mvp caliber player isnt one of the biggest differences of all-time. plenty of players go from   just this season harden went from playing with david nwaba/pj tucker at forward to kevin durant. that's a way bigger difference.  or anthony davis going from playing with elfrid payton as a primary playmaker to lebron james  or lebron going from anthony parker at sg to prime dwade.  and im probably missing a bunch of bigger ones. vucevic to jokic isnt on the same tier lol

"Draymond Green on Kevin Durant: ""In the locker room he’s like, 'These are the easiest baskets I’ve gotten in my whole career.'"""
"Because of new TV deals bringing in massive revenue for the NBA, the salary cap ballooned in the summer of 2016.  Each team was given a bonus of $24 million in cap space. So basically every team in the NBA had cap space to sign free agents. And those that already had some space, just ended up having wayyyy too much space, they didn’t know what to do with it.  As a result, that summer 2016, free agents were overpaid like craaazyyyy. Some bum players like Mozgov and Parsons, among others, basically got paid like all-stars. It was ugly.  And most famously, it gave the Golden State Warriors the necessary cap space to sign Kevin Durant. And the rest is history."

I'll just answer 2005.   Kevin Durant comp Tracy McGrady  Kyrie Irving comp Allen Iverson  James Harden comp Dwayne Wade
"6 assist doesnt matter cause he's one of the only pg that's a legitimate threat to score 30 and offers his teammates unreal spacing. That ability to take on the scoring load is why he's different and something most point guards lack. And even if he sucks in the Finals those other guys struggle to get there. And he's won 3 WCF without Kevin Durant  I said he was 2nd, but I wouldnt debate  Isiah Thomas over him personally."

"&gt; Something people ITT are conveniently ignoring.  No, I'm not ignoring it. I'm talking about who is better *right now.*  How relevant are KD and Harden's first ~8 years or whatever number you want to use when evaluating a player *right now?*   &gt; Replace KD with Harden on those GSW teams and I guarantee he would still average his usual chokes in the playoffs.  Statements like this are among the dumbest on this subreddit.  Why are you using a situation you cannot prove either way to make a point?  There's literally nothing that supports what you're saying.  The last time we saw both Kevin Durant and James Harden in the playoffs, Harden was the better player overall."
"&gt;It's all about process driven analysis and Brooks flaws were blatantly obvious at a very early stage.  How early of a stage are you implying here? This just seems like peak revisionist thinking. It's incredibly easy to look at what Brooks has done in recent years and his relative inability to grow as a coach and lambast Presti for not firing him in the past but this claim that everyone knew his ""blatantly obvious flaws"" is complete bs. Could you describe the ""process driven analysis"" you used to arrive at your conclusions? It seems like your just bandwagoning the Scott Brooks hate train.   &gt;Furthermore Presti held onto Brooks for years after the early successes in 2011 and 2012. He held onto him for so long until Kevin Durant had already mentally checked out.  Yeah, Presti held on to him for three more years in which the team made the WCSF, made the WCF, then barely missed the playoffs cause of a Durant season-ending injury. What a terrible three years lmao. And this was after they already dealt Harden so the ""he only did it with three mvp talents"" doesn't shake out either.   &gt;so long until Kevin Durant had already mentally checked out.  Again, this is just straight up incorrect revisionist thinking. You're claiming Scott Brooks caused Durant to ""mentally check out"" even though Durant stayed in OKC for a season **after** Brooks left, made it to the WCF finals, then said he would have stayed had he won? How do you look at that and claim holding on to Brooks caused Kd to ""mentally check out""."
Solely result oriented decision-making is considered bad practice nowadays. It's all about process driven analysis and Brooks flaws were blatantly obvious at a very early stage.  If Masai Ujiri had followed the same approach Toronto would not have promoted Nick Nurse and fired coach of the year Dwane Casey after playoff failure.  Furthermore Presti held onto Brooks for years after the early successes in 2011 and 2012. He held onto him for so long until Kevin Durant had already mentally checked out.
"I'm sure no names like Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are beside themselves that all eyes are on Reggie fucking Bullock and Julius Randle."
Ibu Yamasaki. He plays like a Japanese Kevin Durant with a projected height of 6'9. He's the best high school player in Japan right now.
All these players listed would be traded if Kevin Durant or Steph Curry were available/interested. Even Dame and Zion. The list of truly untouchable players is really short
Kevin Durant hates gay people.
"Basketball is now an international game and there are more athletic bigs born outside the U.S. than inside the U.S.  The NBA now has a vast network of international scouts looking for athletic bigs.  Colleges and even some high schools look for international bigs as well, offering them an opportunity to get ready for the NBA.  Meanwhile American players who would have been bigs in an earlier era would rather be power forwards and even small forwards.  Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant could have been centers but prefer to play as forwards.  One exception you forgot to mention is Edrice Femi ""Bam"" Adebayo, who sounds foreign but was born in New Jersey."
"Yes you just described a guard. He was 6’10 coming into the league, https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/"
"There's this other dude named Kevin (I think his last name is Durant) that's pretty good too, you should try to get him"
"He's 7'0 and *possibly* still growing. Kevin Durant is 6'10, Ingram is 6'9 maybe 6'10. Once you start getting to 7'0, physics tends to treat your body a bit differently.  You're right though, he's very light weight, so that might help his longevity."
"Rookie scorers arent efficient, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Lebron James all were inefficient."
"I mean, his build is more Kevin Durant/Brandon Ingram than a ball handling center."
"&gt; Speaking to Bob Fitzgerald on KNBR, Durant put fact over fiction when answering the age-old question of how tall he really is.  &gt; ""Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6'10"" and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I'm 7-feet,"" Durant finally revealed.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/amp/"
https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2018/07/26/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-home-pull-up-podcast-c-j-mccollum/amp/  That’s why he spent like four years not understanding why the fans booed him and took it so personally.
"Yeah my bad, he didn't say it convincingly just that he could see himself retiring at 35, here is the article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2780594-kevin-durant-says-he-can-see-himself-retiring-at-age-35-number-in-my-mind.amp.html"
Yeah it'll be interesting to see how well he can bulk up or if he'll always have the lanky Kevin Durant frame.
Just like how Kevin Durant won 2 Finals MVP's. This is who Harden decided to join in his prime.  And I menioned other stars aside from Dwight.
But guys!!! His +/- tells the true story!! Trade Wiseman and Minnesota pick for Kevin Durant and start a dynasty 😩😩
This is nothing money for Kevin Durant to pay
"We, as a society have to do better.   We, as a society HAVE to stop victim blaming and victim shaming.  This man was threatened, abused, and dehumanized by Kevin Durant and he's the one being relentlessly harassed being called snitch, rat, herpes face, herpes boy, herpes mouth, ugly herpes toad, etc.   There's something wrong with this and we are all to blame!"
"&gt;	It’s also very clear you cannot have a conversation without resorting to personal attacks.   Cry harder lmao   &gt;	Joining the league MVP has nothing to do with basketball ability. You really got me on the MVPs and more rings.  You still don’t get it do you. We have 3 years of data that shows Kevin Durant shoots below league average effiency when asked to initiate the offense *on the warriors*. Durant with a stacked warriors roster without Curry are a fringe playoff team. Add Curry to the mix and take out Durant? Curry keeps the offense firing in all cylinders.    &gt;	. Yet, Kevin Durant has had a better individual season, playoff performance, and consistent success than Stephen curry.  Curry beat Durant not sure how what you’re thinking here. Head to head Curry destroyed Durant with an inferior cast.   &gt;	Isn’t a better player than Kevin Durant. It’s also fucking stupid how you make it seem like kd&gt;steph is such a casual argument.   Yes you’re a casual fan we have already discussed this. Curry has the better peak. Curry’s playmaking and volume hold up against -10 defenses where Durant cratered in OKC when asked to do the same.   If Durant is the better player why couldn’t Kerr trust him to initiate the offense deep into the post season? Why according to touches, time spent with ball, passes completed, does it show that Curry is first in all these categories while Durant is third behind Draymond?  Why did Ty Lue and lebron and the rockets all try and trap Curry from half court and leave Kevin Durant wide open? These guys are obviously just stat nerds too, huh?"
"Less than a year ESPN put Steph higher than KD.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11%3Fplatform%3Damp  So if anyone is align with clown takes it’s you. It’s also very clear you cannot have a conversation without resorting to personal attacks. Joining the league MVP has nothing to do with basketball ability. You really got me on the MVPs and more rings. Steph curry revolutionized basketball with his three shooting. Broke the league and for two years they had no way to answer. Yet, Kevin Durant has had a better individual season, playoff performance, and consistent success than Stephen curry. You seem to convieniently ignore every single thing besides rings and MVPS, which rings in of itself are extremely circumstantial (draymond green&gt;Steve Nash, amirite?).   Steph curry is a phenomenal player, a once in a lifetime talent. Literally changed the game. Isn’t a better player than Kevin Durant. It’s also fucking stupid how you make it seem like kd&gt;steph is such a casual argument. No. Only people on this website who religiously use advanced stats (especially notoriously faulty ones for defensive metrics) and tie up everything before golden state and after and ignore it because you get butthurt about his team choices."
"&gt;	go talk to anyone in real life, Kevin Durant is a better basketball player, both in his prime and all time than Steph curry.   It’s nice that you keep parroting ESPN esque takes, clown.   &gt;	Your argument begins and ends at MVP’s and statistics.   Yes because Curry *has more MVPS, more rings, led better offenses and **didnt join the league MVP after getting smacked playing like dogshit .***  &gt;	I’m not allergic to critical thinking, I just watch basketball   Ya let’s use your famous “”””eye test””””” im sure someone like yourself—who has ESPN clown takes—knows more than analysts and coaches.   &gt;	Because Kevin Durant was and is elite at both.  Lmao. Is he? According to what? Your feelings? Or data that is trackable *that measures impact*? Clearly you’re having trouble with this distinction. That data shows Durant grades out neutral: which if you don’t know what that means it means he’s *not elite*. Lebron, for example, has anchored top defenses like in 2013. Durant hasn’t come close.   &gt;	You get in your feelings about joining a super team there at the end, again derailing your argument.   It’s not derailing my argument it’s supporting it: Curry didn’t join Durant. Durant joined Curry. Wonder why that is? Why did Durant’s effiency plummet **7 points** the moment he was forced to handle the ball and be a primary creator?  You’re embarrassing"
"Amazing how he did that by himself and that he didn't have 3 other all stars with him plus a great bench. At least the Cavs were full strength in their first, wait, they didn't have Kevin Love and were down 2-1 until Kyrie was out too. Kevin Durant had nothing to do with it either, right, the all around better player than Steph yeah he held them back.  Steph had a good run but the Suns gonna shit on them from now on sorry."
"I've found that converting their stats to per 75 really help compare stars across eras to Stars today, as stars now play about 75 possessions a game  |***Player***|*Pts/75*|*Trb/75*|*Ast/75*|*rTS%*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |***Luka Doncic***|***28.1***|***9.2***|***8.4***|*+11%*| |***Kevin Durant***|*25.7*|*6.2*|*2.7*|***+26%***|  &amp;#x200B;  |***Basic Advanced Stats***|*BPM*|*DBPM*|*Net Rating*|*VORP*|*WS/48*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |***Luka Doncic***|***6.4***|***0.7***|*+2*|*12.3*|***.157***| |***Kevin Durant***|*3.6*|*0.1*|***+3***|***12.6***|*.142*|"
"Bruh I legit thought of K Love cause you said Kevin, probably should stick with KD or Durant"
When you realize the Nets have been playing at a league best pace without Kevin Durant.
https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy
How many years have you been a warriors fan exactly? They drafted one of the deepest teams of all time and brought on kevin durant following the best regular season ever.
That’s going to be the Kevin Durant sequel when builds a super team with the goon squad and superman
"He’s the second best player at his position ever.   Wherever people want to rank him overall doesn’t matter to me, some people (like Kevin Durant for example) say he’s top 5, others say he’s top 15.   Regardless of wherever you wanna put him, he along with Shaq and Tim Duncan were the best players of their era and the only dude better than him at his position is the greater player of all time."
kevin durant
What I find most incredible is that Kevin Durant doesn't even apologize for his intolerable comments.  He only said he regretted that it became public. That's quite different.  An exceptional player who will never be able to have the same aura as LeBron James off the court.
"It's true but I don't get what people are exactly trying to argue. That Kerr should change the way the team plays, so it would maybe do better when Steph Curry is out?   Yeah it would be nice, but you can say the same about any team. I dunno, is the supposition here that another coach could make a team centered around Wiggins, Oubre and Toscano-Anderson win NBA games? Come on.  This team had four max contracts basically, and at the moment three of these players are out, and the fourth decided to leave so as a lesser evil they chose to s-n-t him for, ultimately, 30 miilion a year for Andrew Wiggins. There's really no wiggling space in this situation. To just hope that their max players, who are good an worth that money, will just be fit, is probably the best they can do.  When they decided to keep all the stars and add Kevin Durant, many people had a first though: ""wow, so this is gonna fuck up their roster possibilities for those years"". Because of that I don't expect that much from Kerr. Yeah the offense is shit... But what can you realistically expect if, without Curry and Dray, anybody they have with any playmaking instinct are guys on minimums and two-way contracts."
"I mean it comes down to the players. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, Lamarcus Aldridge is a stronger lineup than any 5 the Lakers can put out there."
"My guy Joel Embiid went from Russell Westbrook to Kevin Durant in terms of percentages, th doubt is warranted"
Have you heard of Kevin Wayne Durant
"Top 10 in order. By the way, I don’t overreact to 30 regular season games like some do. A 3 month stretch isn’t going to undermine years of someone else’s work.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Stephen Curry   4. Kawhi Leonard   5. James Harden   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Damian Lillard   10. Anthony Davis"
"Yes they would, if the y are attracting so much attention on defense that their SF gets wide open shots lol  That literally happened in ever Finals vs the Cavs, be it Harrison Barnes or Kevin Durant himself. The Cavs knew who would break them."
"Yeah, it is an old tweet - and my point is that even when it got press [back in 2016](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2014/10/30/old-tweets-kevin-durant-uses-gay-slurs-including-at-russell-westbrook-damian-lillard-rips-lebron-james/) thanks to r/nba's very own /u/jewishdoggy [posting it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2kq2z4/i_dug_deep_and_found_tweets_from_nba_players/), he still didn't delete it. Dude's thin skinned and emotionally immature."
"My dude. You can’t even explain to me what a single of those dumbass advanced stats means. Go talk to anyone in real life, Kevin Durant is a better basketball player, both in his prime and all time than Steph curry. Real life is not Reddit. Your argument begins and ends at MVP’s and statistics. I’m not allergic to critical thinking, I just watch basketball and have friends in real life.  And sure, explain your stupid ass argument about iso vs team defense. Because Kevin Durant was and is elite at both. You get in your feelings about joining a super team there at the end, again derailing your argument. His temperament or “weakness” as a man doesn’t mean he’s not better than curry. Because he is."
"Ah yes, defensive titan Kevin Durant"
"I don't know Rapaport for more than Prison Break and dunking on Trump all the time, but if he made KEvin Durant that mad, that makes me like him more."
Or you just ignore it like an adult? He's not 21 anymore and who gives a shit what Michael Rapaport thinks? Kevin Durant certainly shouldn't.
Kevin Durant isn’t walking through that door
Kevin Durant would solve a lot of our problems lol
"I mean, Kevin Durant went #2 overall in his draft, as did Brandon Ingram but yeah there seems to be sort of a trend. I think it's due to the fact that the team who picks second likely misses out on the clear cut best player, so they try to reach for the player with the most upside to try to make up for it."
Kevin Durant is an idiot for even engaging with that clown. Do stupid things get stupid results. Should of been a worse fine than what he got.
"That's bs, Kevin Durant is not property of the NBA to be getting fined for DMs that Rapaport initiated"
"&gt;This is one of the greatest regular-season losses of all time, proving how garbage of a roster this year.   That's a shit and delusional excuse lad. You have no idea what an actual ""garbage roster"" looks like. or maybe you do. Your team did play against LeBron's Cavs a lot before  &gt;  GSW is not a bad team by any means.. They have more talent than the Phoenix Suns, but Suns just playing better as a team.    People thought GSW would be like that, but nope. Even with Klay, there wouldn't have been much of a difference. They don't have the 2015 bench depth, or a Kevin Durant. The entire West is different now   &gt;    Steph is not a LeBron or KD or Giannis either.  To lead a team single handedly, you gotta be able to do A LOT more than just shoot and score points. Someone like Steph is far too easy to neutralize when his ""magical 3pt shots"" ain't falling. He's too small.. And it's just the Regular season  &gt;  Most of you GSW fans been a fan since 2014, so you probably still delusional about the whole ""GSW being shit"" reality. But that's always been the case, until they got that insane bench depth in 2015, and then Kevin Durant.   &gt;  Draymond is not at his DPOY level either.. He used to carry the entire defense before. He's also the true ""leader"" for that team. Always has been   So when Dray is not leading, and not being energized.. GSW looks stale  &gt;   **EDIT**:  GSW are also in the West, so even less room for error. Especially since many West teams that was in the lottery before, are now high level contenders.    The goddamn defending Champions was also in the lottery just few years ago.. That's a massive difference"
"There hasn't been a whole lot of parity in the league like there was in the 70s. Instead you have teams that go to multiple finals, back to back championships, even three-peats. We've got dinasties and the greatest teams (and players) in nba history dominating.  Chuck, Karl Malone, John Stockton had to face Michael Fucking Jordan and the Bulls, a team that three-peated on two separate occasions.  AI ended up having to face the dominant Kobe-Shaq Lakers who'll end up three-peating. That decade, in the west, ended up being dominated by the Lakers and Spurs. Also why Steve Nash doesn't have a ring.  And then you have the Big Three Celtics, the Big Three Miami. Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant weren't going to beat *that* Miami team.   And then the later half of the decade, you got a team that just broke the record for the best ever regular season record. And then the next year they add one of the greatest scorers ever to their roster. So it's not exactly crazy that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Damian Lillard weren't going to get to the finals having to go through them  And of course you've got LeBron going to the finals every year, Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan's biggest obstacle in the east.  The point is only one team gets the chip. Out of 30. And we've been seeing the same all-time great teams stopping so many MVP-caliber players from getting a ring.   The NBA community's gotten to a cancerous point where players aren't appreciated for their greatness. Instead all we wanna talk about is all time rankings, which is why the media and fans have put so much value on rings.   And then the media wanna complain why these superteams are formed? And then they're gonna talk about how great players like Brodie don't have a ring?? Like damn. Look at the competition they're facing."
Healthy kevin durant was out and so was looney they had no backup center and where playing shaun livingston almost as a starter
"Players can be great without winning championships, but I'm quite reluctant to accept this line of reasoning for Russell Westbrook.   Allen Iverson was a 5'10 underdog who did all of the heavy lifting on middling rosters in Philadelphia, and Charles Barkley spent the peak of his career losing to Michael Jordan's Bulls before succumbing to unlucky injuries in Houston. The Stockton/Malone duo didn't benefit from a stellar supporting cast on the Utah Jazz, and the 1998 NBA lockout was merely insult to injury after the Game 6 loss to MJ's Bulls. (Karl Malone is a despicable human being off the court - would hold off from including him amongst ""the greatest"" of anything except sexual offenders.)  Russell Westbrook has been beset by injury, and he had the misfortune of playing versus LeBron/stacked Warriors rosters during his prime. Other than his time with Kevin Durant, Westbrook doesn't have a history of finals appearances or deep runs in playoffs despite having decent rosters.   Westbrook's stats look impressive because they are artificially inflated by his high usage rate and penchant for stealing rebounds from teammates. Triple-doubles are more commonplace in today's NBA than in prior eras - a fact worth noting when discussing this achievement. He has no difficulty with offensive production, but most people would critique his playmaking and 3-point shooting (especially given the sheer volume of attempted shots).   If you define ""greatest point guards"" as players who masterfully facilitated their team's offense, then I wouldn't place Westbrook on that list - in spite of his Hall of Fame-tier stats in certain categories."
This is ridiculous. Those were private DMs and Kevin Durant was wrong. Rapaport does like to guzzle cum.
"&gt;No, it's way worse. The Warriors with KD playing are the greatest team of all time, the Warriors without KD are merely a superteam. The Raptors' number 1 and number 2 options playing injured is worse  No, it's not  &gt;Klay went out at the end of the 3rd in Game 6 after getting his ass kicked all but 1 quarter he played in what the fuck are you talking about you poor deluded soul  Klay literally got injured in Game 2, didn't play Game 3 and got rushed back which led to his easy ACL tear  &gt;and why don't we put in Ibaka's 2015 injury too while we're at it  An injury from a week before in the Finals or actually IN the Finals is the same as a Finals. Kawhi literally injured Looney himself in the Finals, you didn't even watch your own team's Finals games.

Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant come to mind
The 2019 raptors were taken to 6 games by 12 minutes of kevin durant and curry and a bunch of g league players
The Nets are a team of scrappy underdogs. Kevin Durant is renowned for his mental toughness
"The most baffling thing is that Giannis doesn't even maximize his defensive skill in the playoffs. How can you have Kevin Durant slicing up your team possession after possession and not take up the task of guarding him as an All Defensive First team player?   The great players step up and take the tough defensive assignments, but not Giannis."
Kevin Durant is a good basketball player
"Don't care about Bucks choking: KEVIN. DURANT.  This is exactly the night he needed and he did it! His gamescore was 49.4 - FOURTH BEST ALL TIME IN THE PLAYOFFS, behind MJ, Chuck, and Dame. Easily his career night.   Honored to have watched this historic performance."
Well his team probably didn’t sign a prime Kevin Durant after blowing a 3-1 lead so yeah
[I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.](https://youtu.be/qb_hswYhkdw?t=55)
"Curry is an all-time great too, but we cannot deny the fact that after fucking ripping his fucking achilles and still playing as if he never was out for a season Kevin Durant is a freak of nature in the NBA."
He is Kevin Durant. You know who he is
&gt;behind an all-time great performance from Kevin Durant - 49p/17r/10a in 48 minutes  Don't forget Harden's triple single as well.
[I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.](https://youtu.be/qb_hswYhkdw?t=55)
wym man he meant Kevin 'Harden' Durant
I was hoping to hear “I’m Kevin Durant. Y’all know who I am” in his post-game interview lol
Kevin Durant is the best player to ever do it. Lefraud is not even top 5
He injured it and recovered because he's Kevin fucking Durant  Warriors fans can be optimistic about Klay now
I’m Kevin Durant you know who I am
KEVIN DURANT GREATEAST BASKETBALL PLAYER ON EARTH.
"Yeah, and when the team needed him to score and match Kevin Durant when it came down to the wire most of what he could muster were transition pullup threes and turnaround fadeaways over James Harden and his 1.25 hamstrings, both of which he bricked because he's a terrible shooter."
KEVIN DURANT- THE GREATEST TOUGH SHOT MAKER IN NBA HISTORY
"No idea but this is the best game I've ever seen Durant play. No superteam teammates (but I'm sure the history books will count 1/10th of James Harden somehow), just Kevin Durant vs. the world and delivering. That floater running three he hit to bail the Nets out of the shot clock was unbelievable."
Mf's doubted Kevin Durant lmaoooooooo
I don't want to hear it. Kevin Durant is the best offensive weapon in the game today and arguably in history
Kevin Durant. My god. What a game. Take a bow.   Hot Take. Giannis is arguably unplayable in end of game situations.
Kevin Durant.
I mean y'all know who he is. He's Kevin Fucking Durant.
You can’t tell me Kevin Durant isn’t the best player in the league.
I don't want to hear it. Kevin Durant is the best offensive weapon in the game today and arguably in history
"Kevin ""nephew reaper"" Durant"
why the fuck would you think Kevin Durant couldn't carry a team
Kevin Batman Durant except Durant would probably go down on his girl.
"I AM KEVIN DURANT, Y'ALL KNOW WHO I AM."
"Bucks deserve to lose this one. Embarassing. KEVIN FUCKING DURANT MAN... insane, coming of a horrific injury, played every second, 49 point triple double.   Also, bye Bud."
"What a game man, Kevin Durant is just a monster. Plain and simple."
Kevin Durant is a super hero
"Kevin Durant might be the goat, idek anymore. This was probably _the_ greatest playoff performance, at least the most impressive.  Played all 48 minutes, a 49 point triple double to carry the corpse of James Harden and a couple of role players in a series-commanding game 5 to the win? *Sheesh*  I'm just happy I was here to witness history."
someone shoulda signed this Kevin Durant character he's pretty good
"Kevin Durant out here putting everyone else to shame playing the whole game with a repaired achilles. Just amazing! Also Coach Bud never ceases to amaze me, but not in the same way lol."
Kevin Durant: not too bad at basketball I guess.
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA and has been since 2016.
kevin fucking durant
Bruh Marv Albert needs to retire   But shout out Kevin Durant ! He was ballin!!
"kevin durant: ""i told coach""  wait how's that possible according to this sub players aren't allowed to have any input on their coach's decisions"
Kevin Durant. Jeff Green.
"That was honestly one of the worst coaching performances I’ve seen in a playoff game.   His defensive choices (dropping Brook, refusing to match up Giannis on KD, having Jrue check a hobbled harden) were abysmal, and that was absolutely brain dead offense. Just nonstop iso-ing but doing it when not even trying to exploit matchups. Like, you should not have Jrue Holiday iso on a locked-in Kevin fucking Durant when Harden can barely move out there."
"I was looking at my screen in disbelief for the last 20 minutes thinking ""There is no way the bucks screw this up. How are they looking so bad? Oh my god now the nets are up. They are really losing to Kevin Durant and the player is formerly known as James Harden. Why did Giannis just pull up for 3 like he was actually going to hit that shit? Did Middleton just hit the backboard? How can a team with this much talent look so bad?  ""  Unbelievable performance by KD but holy shit but unless the bucks come out possessed the next two games this is an all-time choke job."
Kevin Durant.
"Attack a one legged Harden instead of isoing against the tallest guy on the other team.  Oh, and double Kevin Durant when he's torching the fuck out of you.  Oh, and bench Lopez and put Giannis at the 5."
literally The Kevin Durant Show
"There is nothing super about one leg harden, Jeff green, Blake griffin and Kevin durant lol"
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is better than Lefraud i quit on the Lakers James.
“I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am.”
Put some RESPEC on his name. THATS KEVIN DURANT. Best player in the NBA.   WOW. Can’t make this shit up. Best game of his life in the biggest moment of his career off an Achilles.
The Bucks lost to Kevin Durant and Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.  I get he's decent but he's Jeff Green.  Jeff Green.
Giannis MVPs: 2. Kevin Durant MVPs: 1  Make it make sense.
I absolutely LOATHE being on the receiving end of a Kevin Durant masterclass.
there is a reason why nba players have said kevin durant is the hardest player they ever guarded
He’s Kevin Durant
His name is Kevin Durant!!
His name is KEVIN DURANT
One of the greatest performances off all time. This is lietrally gonna go down as a classic. He played full 48 minutes too .That's crazy. Kevin Durant climbing through all-time list !!
Bucks run maybe the ugliest offense I’ve ever seen. If you’re just going to run ISO after ISO then it helps to be the team with Kevin Durant. Big yikes for that choke job.
I’m Kevin Durant you know who I am
"“I’m Kevin Durant, y’all know who I am”"
"all time joke job. bud is straight up embarrassing at this point. also, kevin durant is ridiculous."
Kevin Durant invented the game of basketball
"A god walked amongst earth today, he took the form of Kevin Durant"
That was beautiful to watch from Kevin Durant
^Kevin  ^Durant  ^is  ^the  ^best    ^basketball  ^player  ^in  ^the  ^world.
All time Choke Job by the Bucks paired with an All Time Great Performance by Kevin Durant  What a night!
Kevin Durant go brrrrrr
Imagine being a first year head coach and getting to roll out Kevin Durant for 48 minutes in a Game 5
Kevin Durant is fucking impressive. Seems that he became miles better from his Achilles tear
Legacy game by Kevin Durant.
This Kevin Durant guy seems to be pretty good. If he keeps practicing he might make it big in this league one day
Who said Kevin Durant could only get a ring by joining the winningest team of all time??

KEVIN DURANT
Kevin. Durant.
"Recently Kevin Durant lead his team to a gold medal, Giannis lead his team to the NBA championship  LeBron recently lost to the Suns in the playoffs, and came back from an ankle injury. Not hating LeBron, injuries happen, but KD and Giannis has more recent success compared to LeBron"
Kevin Durant is poetry and the way he talks about basketball is poetry too
Paul George and Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant. Just beautiful to watch. Kyrie is also another one.
I think one day Kevin Knox might be able to flow like Durant.
Kevin Durant
"Lacob said in 2019 they were retiring [Iggy's jersey](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/why-warriors-will-retire-kevin-durant-andre-iguodalas-jersey-numbers) \- so I guess the Hamptons Five are all getting retired, not sure anything was said about SDot yet"
Kevin Durant is also on the list.
Kevin Durant??
super skinny meme Kevin Durant &gt;&gt;&gt; both of them
"&gt;	He brought OKC with Kevin Durant down,  This is a fucking load of bullshit and just revisionism to force a narrative. We missed out on a good playoffs run when Patrick Beverly blew Russ’s knee out. He was the athletic slasher to KD’s clinical perimeter shooting. What brought us down was KD and Westbrook both underperforming after being 3-1 up against GSW. After that we all know what happened."
What do you do when you face maybe the best team of all time and then they add Kevin Durant???
"Westbrook is not an asset when surrounded by other good players. When in a role-player position, he brings everyone down.  He brought OKC with Kevin Durant down, he brought Harden down on Houston. And he missed how many shots in that game last night. He can't shoot, so he doesn't create space for good players. He can't be the main ball handler on a team that already has LeBron. You don't need him to rebound on a team that has AD.  He has proven to be pretty incredible when he's on his own surrounded by a bad team like the KD-less Thunder and the Wizards. The Lakers should not have Westbrook play on the same rotation as LeBron and AD. Ever.  He should play off the bench and lead the second stringers. The LeBron/Westbrook/AD is not a trio that can work."
"Most people don't hold it against him, but I feel like its all about framing. Its an accomplishment in itself to go to the NBA finals 8 times, full stop. But the way its being described, while technically accurate, doesn't convey the entire story.  &amp;#x200B;  Its the difference between ""Giannis dropped 50 in the NBA finals to close it out"" vs ""Giannis dropped 50 on the Phoenix Suns"", or even ""Kevin Durant took the Bucks to 7 by himself"" compared to ""He won 1 out of 4 games after Kyrie dropped"".   &amp;#x200B;  Bron's run is a terrific feat, but will probably look even better when history starts to erode away. Rarely was there another true contender in the conference with him that had a snowballs chance in hell of actually winning the title during the 8 straight if we're keeping it a buck."
I think 5 things would've happened:  - The Thunder win the championship in 2014  - Kevin Durant doesn't go to Golden State in 2017  - Either the Cavaliers repeat in 2017 or the Spurs win in 2017  - The Rockets would've won the championship in 2018  - The Raptors would not have won the championship
"day to day specifics don't really matter in this situation. look at Seattle, they drafted Kevin Durant who looked super promising like the next big star yet that didn't stop Bennett and company from moving the team.  Regardless of what happens with Zion, the Pelicans are in deep trouble as a franchise in that city."
"What's funny is that most champions - even in the last 10-15 years - were easily their best when they had their mid-range and/or post game working.   The Warriors just happened to have two of the absolute best shooters ever - and one could argue the two best, period. But, the Warriors set some records, made some Finals, and - oh, by the way, added Kevin Durant - so the fanbase who doesn't fully understand the game suddenly thought every team should just shoot threes.  Yes, two points is fewer than three.  But, if I can get 10 points from driving the lane/shooting mid-range shots or get six points shooting threes, I'd venture to say the 2-pters did more to help the team."
Kevin Durant I see. Lebron has slowed a bit. He's still a top 3 player of all time but he's definitely not the best player in the league RIGHT NOW.
"Its Lopez's counter if he's runnin the PnR and takes a pullup middy when Lopez drops to cover the roll-man (like Chris Paul or Kevin Durant), but the shots Bam were taking were basic triple threat jumpers. Sure it would help, but the midrange is close enough to the paint where Lopez can't easily be beat, and Lopez can contest set shots among the best of them."
Kevin Durant is a mid range assassin. It's his best shot. Look at what it does for his game
"I think he is. Dude is a bad off ball defender and is late in transition D. He also is inefficient shooting the ball. Russell Westbrook going 100% speed is the only good thing about him in offense (its the only good thing he does on offense other than the obvious kickout to the open man) and even then his passes are reckless and so are his handles. He's a point guard yet I don't trust him in handling the ball compared to other elite point guards. Dude is too reckless and that's just not good.   Don't get me wrong he has upside, but his downsides overweigh what he can give to the Lakers team. He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. He's been traded three times now and for a good reason.   What's he gonna do now that he didn't do with James Harden? With PG and Melo the first time? With Kevin Durant? With Bradley Beal? This is the same Lakers team that left him wide open during the Bubble when they eliminated the Rockets. What's he gonna do? Tell me? Distribute the ball and kick it out? How many times will he turnover the ball? And if he does, do you really want LeBron and AD be spot up shooters for him? How many times will he shoot an unnecessary jumper?"
"He is as good a shooter as anyone ever NOT named Steph Curry.  Its a debate... You can slice it up... Best shooter with variety... best catch and shoot... best in motion... best off the bounce... three levels... distance- deep range... but simply on PURE SHOOTING he's right there.  Reggie Miller Ray Allen Kevin Durant Larry Bird Klay Thompson  There's some style and flavor preferences no doubt when we argue, but the debate for 2nd best shooter EVER does include Klay Thompson."

Kevin Durant
"Just because there aren't 10 ""KD is an amazing player"" threads on this sub every day does not mean he's being slept on. He's Kevin Durant. We know who he is."
Kevin Durant is still somehow playing great ball despite an Achilles tear. Like he never left.
Kevin Durant good
Kevin Durant—best player in basketball.
With Kyrie out the pressure is on James Harden. Luckily he has the best #2 he's ever had in Kevin Durant
If I had just woken up from a coma and you told me that Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles 28 months ago and has since played a full all-star season followed immediately by a full Olympics schedule and still looks this elite I'd tell you to go fuck yourself completely
Kevin Durant is just not fair. Nobody should be allowed to have that size and skill combination
Kyrie didnt even play in 2015. He also wasnt on the team in 2018. So literally steph needed a top 20 player in Kevin Durant to beat Lebron and Kyrie.
The memories of rookie Kevin Durant?

"Not in last 10 years (a bit more) but I do think about Portland's possible lineup of KD, Giannis, Dame.  Blazers: Kevin Durant, Damian Lilliard, Giannis Antetokoumpo, (2017: one of 'em? John Collins/OG/Jarrett Allen.)"
Man is crying about being the third option to fucking Steph Curry and Kevin Durant and not being top 75. Lmao fuck off Klay
"That's a poor excuse for his lack of skill development.   Shaun Livingston had skinny legs too, but he could still post up. He couldn't back guys under the rim like Shaq, but he wasn't embarrassing himself like KP. You give Livingston a defender in the post that's 7"" shorter than him and not named Kyle Lowry, that's BBQ chicken.   [11 minutes of Shaun Livingston hitting turnaround jumpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPvJE7e51ug)  KD also has skinny legs, and can't back anyone down either. Here's 11 minutes of him scoring on post ups.   [Kevin Durant Post Scoring '18/19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-OR0w8gnWU)"
"Reggie was also the star of his team in an era where the rules were much less favorable to perimeter shooters.  Klay has spent his whole career with the most shooter friendly officiating the league has ever seen, and he’s had Steph Curry and Kevin Durant drawing the defenses’ attention."
"But that's not at all what I said.   I said the things that set curry apart are skills he developed. His range, quick release, and handle, are all things he had to work on instead of being given. In contrast, KDs figured out how to absolutely maximize what he was given ( in terms of physical advantages and no duh He's put the work in to develop the skills behind that ). How hard they work on those skills or developing others is something completely separate. If Curry was 7 ft tall, he'd have no need to develop that range and quick release and could work on his post game much more or whatever.  Think of it this way, if you took Curry and Kevin Durant, and took away all their previous basketball knowledge and skills, and made them play one-on-one against each other. Who do you think would win?"
Yeah that’s a pretty hot take lol. He was never lower than third and that was only when Kevin freaking Durant was second.
"Heres  a small sampling of players English has outscored in his career...Reggie Miller, Jerry West, Patrick Ewing, Ray Allen, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant."
"I would say a lot of guys have valid arguments for being the second best shooter of all time. For example, a guy like Kevin Durant might have lower 3pt percentage but his volume of total jumpshots is higher, mid-range percentage is higher, and shot difficulty is much higher due to always being the defensive focus. It would be possible if roles were reversed, meaning Klay is the primary offensive option with defense centered on stopping him, and KD becomes a spot up shooter, that KD comes away with more efficient stats while Klay's drop off.   Obviously, Klay is an amazing shooter but I just feel like Steph redefined what a perfect shooter is and as a result players taking difficult off the dribble shots with efficiency is my criteria for who the best shooters are to me."
How will James Harden or Kevin Durant score on that monster?!

"It worked for a bit, until Kevin Durant realized who he was. It was like when Rockets guarded KD with CP for some possessions in 2018, I think the smaller defender can get underneath KD and make it harder for him to pull up. At the end of the he’s KD so nothing will really work in the long run, but giving him different looks defensively might make it a little tougher."

People aren't going to like this lol  Paul George vs. Steph Curry is about as united as r/nba will ever get  At least until we get Steph Curry vs. Kevin Durant and James Harden
"Correct. Bob McAdoo and Dominique Wilkins.  3 guys made it in, but weren't on the original list and were mid career. Dennis Rodman, Reggie Miller and Gary Payton.  There were other guys in the league / rookies but obviously didn't have enough resume, since it was 1996/97. That gets Ray Allen, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Allen Iverson, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash.  Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce were another year or two away and Dwayne Wade was a few more years.  The rest of the new list is all active. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Russ Westbrook.  No real issues maybe other than Davis and Lillard, how do they stack up against full career Tony Parker, Tracy McGrady, Chris Webber, Vince Carter and especially nearly full career Dwight Howard who seems a glaring omission. Does Grant Hill get any leeway for what he should've become and proved he could be (although for not long enough)?  Anyone likely a lock for this in 25 years when they do 100 years? Doncic? Jokic?

McAdoo, now an assistant coach with the Heat, was the original Durant – in size and skill set and star power – during an early career that mirrors Durant's first three seasons.  Both were drafted second overall, were named Rookie of the Year and won three scoring titles at a young age.  “He reminds me exactly of me,” McAdoo said Monday, sitting courtside at Chesapeake Energy Arena on the eve of Game 1 of The Finals. “His game is basically the same, except he's got much deeper range than me. I didn't grow up with the 3-point line. But he's a carbon copy.”  McAdoo and Durant have even talked about the comparisons, per a push from Thunder assistant Maurice Cheeks.  “He even came over and introduced himself to me about three years ago and told me that his coach, Maurice Cheeks, told him that he played just like me,” McAdoo said. “So every time I see him now I tease him, I call him ‘Baby McAdoo.'”   Guess you know better than the man himself."
I think rings is extra weak in this comparison because Klay was never the #1 option for his rings. He was paired with the greatest shooter ever and then added Kevin Durant. It's hard to toss out rings as an argument with that lineup.
Did you just compare Bob McAdoo to Kevin Durant??
Yup. The fact that the best regular season team of all time replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant is just absurd.

Ever heard of Kevin Durant? The man who used fake accounts on Twitter and Instagram (and who knows what other sites) to defend himself from criticism?
I mean Kevin Durant exists my dude lol  Spoiler: I love KD
Bruh Kevin Durant is at 23k points and 3 years younger than Lebron. James Harden is at 22k points and 4 years younger. They ain't even close to the same path as Lebron at 35k lol tf.
It’s not gonna happen. I remember someone saying that every arena was gonna boo Kevin Durant for going to the warriors and it never happened
How was it like being able to play with Kevin Durant and Kyrie
"We wanted Kevin Durant, but we compromised. We took the remainder of Derrick Rose's knees instead."
"Yall need to find somebody to make a ""Fuck Ben Simmons"" song in the vein of the ""Fuck Kevin Durant"" or ""Fuck Steph Curry"" songs"
"Toronto when Durant went down in the finals. Bill Walton, Portland Trail Blazers, 1978 NBA Playoffs. Kyrie Irving/Kevin Love, 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers. Bill Russell, Boston Celtics, 1958. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks, 2003 NBA Playoffs. Derrick Rose, 2012 Chicago Bulls.   Injuries happen. Bucks were still a top team in the league and have arguably been the best team in the league, record wise, the last 3 years. Cry more."
Who on the hawks could have guarded Kevin Durant?
"Dude who cares? Lots of MVPs embarrassed themselves in the playoffs (Jokic got swept) due to the ironic algorithm of getting the MVP (Great stats-great team record with the minimal amount of help) otherwise, in 2017-2018 one of Kevin Durant/Steph Curry could've gotten it otherwise. You wouldn't want that would you?  And pointing out objective facts? You're obviously just cherry picking and I just see no purpose of you doing so? Like what's your point? Unless you're trying to prop up a better player then you're really just hating."
PG: LeBron James  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Larry Bird  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Hakeem Olajuwon
Remember Kevin Durant coming into the league? He couldn't even bench 185 at the combine. He'll grow.
"Curry was completely destroying the Clippers in that 2019 series up until Kevin ""You know who I am"" Durant decided to double his FGA and warriors started just running iso plays for KD or just use Curry PnR to set up free dunks for Iguodala and KD"
Can't believe we let Harrison Barnes go in order to sign Kevin Durant
do you not remember kevin durant going 7-33 in the playoffs against your own team?
Kevin Durant opted to take the hardest road and go to the underdog franchise Golden State Warriors
"Hes got weird proportions -- very broad shoulders, small head, short torso, long legs. I think it makes him look bulky if he beefs up even a little bit in the shoulders.  In contrast, say, Kevin Durant has such a narrow build that he could bulk up a bunch in his upper body and still look like the Slim Reaper."
You think the defending champs vs a super team with Kevin Durant and James Harden having the lowest ratings in 14 years is not surprising?
Kevin Durant?  Lebron James?
The guy filled a role of starting in the Playoffs already thanks to being the guy with the capabilities to guard Kevin Durant.  PJ was valuable for the Bucks.
"All that matters ultimately is: ""who is guarding Kevin Durant in the playoffs?"" With Tucker, that question is answered. Without him, it becomes a game of musical chairs that either asks Giannis to do too much on both ends or asks Holiday or Middelton to consistently guard out of position."
I bet Sixers want Kevin Durant and Harden for Simmons too
"Perhaps, but they might not beat Brooklyn if anyone else was guarding Kevin Durant."
"Sounds like a solid plan. If they can manage to snag, for example, the next Kevin Durant or James Harden, or even better - Both, that'd be huge for them."
"Bucks are the reigning champ led by Giannis, a 2 time MVP. Considered a top 3 player unanimously. The favorites for the finals (I believe) are still the Lakers from the west and the nets from the east. Lakers are led by Lebron James as you most likely know and his costars Anthony Davis and Westbrook. Nets are led by Kevin Durant, James Harden, and for now Kyrie (lots of drama surrounding him right now).   Lots of other teams in the mix that are “contenders” like the Jazz, Suns, Hawks, and others each led by their own all star.

Giannis shooting average from the FT line isn't even fair and it looks like he might do it anyways. His form and speed have improved a ton.  I'm not claiming he'll shoot like Dirk or Kevin Durant but is it really out of the question that he shoots like 32% from 3 on 3 attempts per game? He seems savvy enough to know not to let it limit his attempts at the rim.
Kevin Durant is laughing his ass off watching Westbrick tonight

"What?  I'm assuming you're saying LeBron has been the best player since 2008 where Kobe was arguably the best.  So by that logic Kevin Durant was the 2nd best other than in 2009 where Dwight led the Magic to the Finals.  Hmm.. thinking about it but I don't know man.  I'd argue James Harden could have been #2 in his MVP year and in the year where Giannis first won it.  Also as a Warriors fan, how can you not list Steph as the 2nd best in at least one of those 5 years during that run?  He was better than KD at least once.  Also KD was injured all of last year, so 2nd would by default fall to:  Harden/Giannis/Curry/Kawhi/etc."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is going to join the Suns after seeing their Hardest road to the NBA Championship
"It's actually the same interview where he said the line ""y'all know who I am. I'm Kevin Durant.""  https://youtu.be/gVZeGCTDLPw  About the halfway point he talks about Pat Bev.  It's really a fantastic interview."
Just watched half of it and thought I was missing something  p.s. what did he do to kevin durant in the first minute of the clip?  was too fast for ol me to see
A guy like Kevin Durant existing  Also Steph Curry  Oscar Robertson's triple double record and being the only player to ever average a triple double would be broken
"I just think they were a little premature on deciding that Chris Paul - who had warranted 160 million only 2 years prior - was on the decline as an athlete. Injury history has always been something to consider with this man but his mvp level play has always been above and beyond when on the court. If we really want to look at the pieces that weren’t working towards a championship for the rockets I think unfortunately we have to look at James harden. I’m not talking in terms of marketability or return on investment from superstardom but from only a perspective of winning I think we can question James ability to win, especially considering he cud not get it done with Kevin Durant twice and the likes of Russell, John wall, and of course Chris Paul."
"So, his Lakers stint completely invalidates everything from 2012-2018? You're acting like players don't want to trade their teammates for upgrades. You should keep the same energy when you traded Lou Will for Rondo. Or Kevin Durant trading Levert and Allen for Harden.     [Did Lebron not help Kuzma up during the same series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbf5NcCtcw)? You clown on Lebron for walking away from Kuzma, but I know for a fact you call Kuzma trash and if he was on your team, you'd be wanting his ass traded as well. I bet you were calling Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram busts in comparison to SGA. Try to be consistent instead of coming across as an idiot."
Yep kevin durant traded for harden to go to the nets

"LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Chris Paul   Dwight Howard   Carmelo Anthony   Russell Westbrook   All of them could retire tomorrow and would still be first ballot. You have others who’d get in but not 1st ballot because of a lack of longevity(Jokic , Giannis, etc)"
"His role is different though.  Everywhere KD goes his role will be exactly the same.  Get the ball, dribble it a couple times, and shoot.  James is such a good facilitator that he is one of the best point guards in the league *while also* being one of the best scorers in the league.  Prior to this, he did both because he was the best point guard on his team by a country mile *and* the best scorer on his team by a country mile as well.  On a team that has arguably the best scorer in the league, another elite scorer, and no good point guards, it makes sense for him to focus less on being a scorer and more on being a facilitator/playmaker.  Kevin Durant will never have to do that because he doesn't have that skillset."

"just because somebody has played that position doesn’t mean that’s where you rank them, nephew  is kevin durant a shooting guard? cuz that’s what he came in the league playing  he’s also played C  lebron has played both point guard and small ball center, would you rank him at either of those positions?  you named a broke back bird, and barkley who i already named  saying “larry johnson and shawn kemp were no joke” is literally just you talking because i never said they were a joke  so you named one player that was competition for malone, who i already said  chuck lol"
Yes because if you actually didn't offer kevin durant that contract if he wanted to go there you're historically incompetent at the job of making the best basketball team you can.

"Career:   Larry bird: .564 ts%  Kevin Durant: .615 ts%  Larry bird's best year: .612 ts% and still below KD's career average. No, bird was not a better scorer.  And Bird's 50/40/90 seasons are overrated since he made less than 100 treys in each of those season."
Unless if your name Kevin Durant. Then you take the hardest road possible
James Harden: sitting at home eating ice cream to force a trade back to CP  Kevin Durant: sitting with his agent figuring out which super team he can form now to most fuck Brooklyn  Kyrie: burning sage in the badlands and drinking aloe water  Nets fans: Experiencing another yearly disappointment with a wide open finals
Am I totally off or does Ayton look like Kevin Durant if Durant got stung by a bee and his face swelled up a bit
"Larry might be special and I didn't watch him play, but I am taking the 7 footer who can shoot. Do I need to drop my Kevin Durant Copypasta or is this enough?"
Kevin Durant will shoot minimum 80%-90% in an open gym from most midrange locations…
"The NBA timeline is fucked right now, Giannis is superhuman and we’ve found this out because Kevin Durant has large toes meanwhile in the west CP3 is about to break the curse and kawhi has vanished. Weird Times"
"Of course, the blame falls mostly on the stars because they have more impact, but this is one of the rare instances where the coach is so wrong on his adjustments that even r/nba can diagnose it properly.  I’m always critical of Giannis’ limitations, but you do best to minimize them and maximize them in the playoffs, and one way you do that is by putting him at the 5 around shooters for longer.   Have him at have the game at the 5 so he can maximize his help defensive output to the best he can and so Lopez stops playing drop coverage while Kevin Durant is pulling up wide open every play. It was painful to watch the Nets call a screen on Lopez literally every play every game while Giannis was in the corner on Blake.  On offense, have him at the 5 so he can be the screener with maximum space to roll hard with his insane gravity. That opens up opportunities for Middleton &amp; Jrue for jumpshots, open looks for 3 and the easiest looks for Giannis at the rim.  He can’t be the on ball player like Bud has been forcing him to. It’s painfully watching him iso against the wall on the ball; he needs to be more efficient and play a smaller role taking smarter shots. He only needs it in transition.  That way? His game would be maximized on both ends and he’d be &gt; Jokic."
Interesting. Would you also say 1987 Larry Bird teleported to 2021 would be a better player than present day Kevin Durant?
"This guy really got screwed I think by that ""2 years away"" off-hand comment by Fran Fraschilla and calling him brazilian kevin durant. Think it really affected his confidence and the way the fans perceived him. Even in this thread years later it still follows him. Feels like it set a clock on him."

Larry Bird. Kevin Durant would just leave to go play with his friends.
"No ligament damage is very good. That said, if the Bucks play him again this postseason, we are going to see another ""Kevin Durant"" Game 5 Finals moment happen again."
I’m not gonna say the most unique but Kevin Durant nasty man. 6’11. 7 something wingspan. Gifted scorer. It’s rare seeing someone with KD’s build playing so fluent
"Kevin Durant is dislike by both OKC and GSW. He's played for 3 franchises and is disliked by 2 of the 3, this is really odd for a player of his caliber."
"I don't think Kevin Durant is soft at all.  It wasn't meant as a statement against Durant.  What I'm saying is that there is a massive difference between the way the game was both played and called in the 1980s.    It's the same reason why I think Larry Bird, who was a three-time All-NBA Defensive player, would be an average defender at best in the modern NBA.  You simply can't do the same things in the modern NBA that you could back in the 80s, and those are things that wear offensive players down, require them to expend extra energy all game long.  *You can't even handcheck anymore.*  Over the course of an 82-game season, it reduces effectiveness, especially if you're playing against guys like Oakley or Laimbeer who are two times as strong as you are and don't give a fuck about whether or not you want to play with them on Team USA or show up for their charity event in the offseason.  Let me explain what I meant when I said this:  &gt; Whoever was guarding him would just grab Durant around the neck as he drove past, drop him on his head, and just keep doing that until he learned to settle into the low post.  Let's suppose that Kevin Durant fell through a wormhole and was somehow also rostered by an NBA team in the 1980s.  There's this assumption by people that whoever his coach was would recognize Durant's unique talents and use him to the fullest extent.  I think that's just plain false.  The Celtics had probably the best shooter in the 1980s in Bird, and when he led the league in 3PAs, he took fewer than 200 of them, and in the modern NBA he would have been ranked so far down the list in attempts it's comical.  There was a way to play basketball and that's how you played it and that's all there was to it. ​An '80s coach would see Kevin Durant and say ""You're a seven-footer, you're going to play in the low post, I don't care how well you shoot or move with the ball.""  They would still run their offense through the point guard and, at best, Durant would become a Garnett-like player who plays with his back to the basket and shoots mid-range jumpers.  If Durant insisted on playing iso ball, taking dudes off the dribble, he would be neutralized pretty quickly by hard fouls, and relegated back to the low-post duties that a big was supposed to stick to in the 1980s.  The dude is insanely talented, but he would be hamstrung by circumstances.  No one would be ""shitting themselves"" over the things he could do."
"&gt; OKC shouldve won the chip in 2016, and its not the FO or the role players or the coaches fault they lost. They lost because their franchise player Kevin Durant Sucked.  very idiotic way to look at OKC's 2016 season. Westbrook was just as bad as KD in that WCF overall. And OKC's management definitely takes blame for trading Harden 4 years prior."
"Not the same thing tho, without klay we cant even compete. Okc were amazing even without harden.  OKC shouldve won the chip in 2016, and its not the FO or the role players or the coaches fault they lost. They lost because  their franchise player Kevin Durant Sucked."
"I'd say lowkey Kevin Durant is a strong contender for this(at least on this sub)  Whenever there's a post about KD on here a lot of the people hating on him are Warriors flairs, especially when Steph is also involved  I think a lot of Warriors fans actually resent him for taking FMVPs and credit away from Steph  A lot of them seem to act like he never played for them"
Kevin Durant
"Even after the I'm Kevin Durant game he was like ""we tried but yall heard what he said"" and laughed it off. He's an underrated good quote"
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is way better than Larry Bird lol. If you don’t think so you may actually be a racist
Kevin Durant. It’s kind of not close. He has literally every skill Bird has plus 2000s level ballhandling and crazy athleticism for his height. He’s a slightly worse passer but I can build around that.
"Then so be it lol they got fucking Kevin Durant in FA. I think any reaction about the best lotto team getting the no. 1 pick would be overblown.   Plus, “what will the warriors do with the first pick??” becomes an exciting story to watch"
"This is great, but what happens when you only focus on scoring. This is what gets lost in the flow of the game, the visual aspect.

"I'm 36. Kevin Durant is obviously a better basketball player than Larry. That's not even factoring in the defensive discussion because there's no discussion there, but on offense Durant also clearly blows Larry out of the water.  There's some major fucking hero worship going on here, which is typical among casuals."
Kevin Durant is not a strong modern player.  We are not talking about Lebron.  Kevin Durant is walking proof that these stick guys from the past could easily dominate in the modern NBA.  Show me one example of Kevin Durant’s strength?
This take is so incredibly bad when we are talking about Kevin Durant and Larry Bird.  Let’s try and fit Kevin Durant and term man handled into the same sentence.  Larry was way more physical than Durant and he was also a way better passer than Durant.  Both are drop dead shooters from every point on the court.  I believe Larry Bird was the only superstar of Jordan’s era that Jordan never “beat”.  The over lap is early in Jordan’s career and Bird’s dumb driveway injury was the turning point for Jordan getting past the Celtics not some epic Jordan performance for victory.
People need to watch full games from that era. Its not as physical as highlight tapes make it out to be. You’re high out of your mind if you would take Larry Bird over Kevin Durant.
larry bird. idc what anybody say kevin durant ain’t proved nun w/o a super team. not to say larry was playing w scrubs but at least he gone go at them
Yeah and Kevin Durant came back from a Achilles tear to be a top 3 player in the nba this year
"Doesn’t work that way anymore.  We still put shit on the 04 Lakers for not going all the way. We still crap on the 2011 heat for choking against Dallas. We still discredit any title Kevin Durant has ever won.   Internet age, and people remember shit."
I was happy to see the crowd feel the same way I did and give Giannis a well-deserved standing ovation. Not like what Toronto did to Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant should have an asterisk next to each ring he has. Asterisk should just say” warriors were already a 70 win team with Harrison Barnes.” Any one better than Harrison Barnes also would’ve won a title.  Paul George, kawaii  siakin derozan,Ingram, Tatum, Middleton, Butler, James , all could’ve won if they had that talent. In my mind he’s still ringless."
"Sure, but ""losing his livelihood"" doesn't really apply here. Kevin Durant is the 1%."
"* 2020 - Jimmy, Bam, and Dragic get injured in the first half of the finals. * 2019 - Kevin Durant missed half the playoffs, tears his Achilles in the finals, and then Klay Thompson tears his ACL in the finals. * 2018 - Chris Paul gets injured in the Western Conference finals, swinging the series. * 2017 - Kawhi is blowing out the KD Warriors and then gets Zaza'd. * 2016 - Andrew Bogut breaks his leg in the finals and Draymond gets suspended for nut tapping LeBron. * 2015 - Kevin Love gets his arm snapped by Kelly Olynyk, Kyrie Irving's knee cap breaks in the first half of the finals, and the refs don't call a technical foul on David Blatt for calling a timeout with no timeouts left."
Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose would like a word... if he's not 100% you don't jeopardize a man like that.
Kevin Durant isn't that great.
Kevin Durant?
It is every year: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kevin-durants-injury-is-exactly-why-the-warriors-needed-kevin-durant/
In terms of how the fans view him it's Kevin Durant  He's better than Westbrook of course but OKC fans hate him for obvious reasons
"Kevin Durant has the GOAT skillset. Think of playing a 5v5 with 4 average player and someone you pick.  Who is the guy that will maximize the most number of combinations of 4 different skilled average players?      I think, it is KD."
"Mikal Bridges can develop all three levels of scoring - spot up, pull up and at the rim, in a really short time : my opinion it will happen in next two seasons. And another: Poetl will become better at defending in space and become dpoy level impact defender (already elite rim protector, but struggle in defending space aka pnr) And another one: Ntilikina is nba  level player and he should play as shooting guard #FREENTILIKINA Michael Porter Junior will be next Kevin Durant Houston will be contenders(i hope they draft Mobley) nex season, Kenyon Martin Jr will be in the race for Most improved player and Khyri Thomas is nba level player his defense is insane. Utah need better defenders to be the true contenders- Gobert cant hold whole defense on his own and Utah failure is not his fault Raptors will be back stronger than ever and B mis season be title favorites"
Kevin Durant is not a greatest of all time type of player... Definitely a generational talent... But not a 🐐
Imagine if it was illegal to double team Kevin Durant what he would do
"Bruh what? Harden barely misses any games. Kevin Durant is not the guy who’s only sort of injured and misses a couple games. At least he hasn’t been that the rest of his career, his increased breaks this season could’ve been from caution around his Achilles, they didn’t need him to win, etc... but then he showed up and kept playing 48 minute games.  The only one who’s consistently injured or out for bullshit is Kyrie.  But even without Kyrie, I think Harden and Durant can win a chip with this team.  Would you have this same critique of the Lakers since AD is injury prone?"
"He's not as good as Kevin Durant either? Wow, Pippen must have really sucked"
"That Kevin Durant joining the Warriors was anything like Lebron James joining the Heat.     KD had a once in a lifetime free agent opportunity where a star player could leave his team and go to a better team without leaving money on the table. Everyone on the team got paid and they didn't have to gut the roster to add him. No ones done it before because they didn't have the option.       Lebron, Wade, and Bosh took significant pay cuts to all play together. It literally was an unfair competitive advantage.  After getting 4 straight trips to the Finals  they put out that they weren't going to do that again because it set a bad precedent for the league. Basically, f\*\*\* you I got mine now we care about parity.     That being said, Lebron did back it up by continuing to go to the Finals after leaving the Heat and Durant is involved in the whole Harden forcing his was to the Net fiasco so... it all evens out."
Kevin Durant can't even sleep at night without another all-nba player in bed with him
"&gt; JUNE 30: The Warriors are trading for D’Angelo Russell, Treveon Graham, and Shabazz Napier from the Nets, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports (Twitter link). The move would be made via sign-and-trade in exchange for Kevin Durant.  Thanks."
"&gt;he got robbed of mvp  When did he get robbed of a finals MVP? 2017 and 2018 there was no way he'd get it over Kevin Durant, and 2015 I don't even think he was on a single ballot. Hell, in 2015 a member of the other team had more votes than he did."
Kevin durant is the most skilled player ever
"He should have that in Durant/Green, but I can kind of understand Kevin in if you didn't know Durant was going to say yes. My guess is PG told them no so the pool was fairly limited. I don't think he'll see the court much but his game is more international friendly (if he gives a shit)."
Not Kevin Durant thats for sure
Unless your name's Kevin Durant
I want to insult Kevin Durant. Have him come to my house and beat me up. This way I can sue him and will never have to work again.
Possibly unpopular? Kevin Durant is the most talented basketball player in history.
"Yes. Example: Jimmy Butler 4 team trade where Philly sent out Butler and Mathias Lessort (2017 2nd round pick, #50).  It’s uncommon but I guess technically legal.  Edit: better example: D’Lo to GSW. Traded by the Brooklyn Nets with Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier to the Golden State Warriors for Kevin Durant and a 2020 1st round draft pick. (top-20 protected)"
I know someone who doesn’t have Magic top 10 but has Kevin Durant in there
kevin durant lookin like hyman roth or uncle jun back there lol

"Idk this bucks team really isn’t that good, remember they just blew like a 20 point lead to Kevin Durant and Jeff green"
Basically the entire history of Kevin Durant moving teams.
"I think Bud coached circles around him in the Semis and without a Kevin Durant performance he wouldn’t have gotten 7 games.  He also clearly doesn’t have any real power considering he was basically like “If Harden wants to play, he’s going too play.”  He might eventually become a good coach, but with the current setup he can’t even really be one."
"This is the most rational take. As a white guy, I’m not offended and I could care less if the entire team is black, but I do think ESPN needs to be consistent and set an appropriate precedent. There was a lot of anti Semitic stuff  that came out early pandemic and none of those guys paid a heavy price. Kevin Durant said some ugly, racially charged homophobic stuff in that silly Rapaport battle and nobody batted an eye. This is why some people are cynical of loud wokeness. It’s not that they’re pro racism or against diversity. It’s just that there is often an insincerity to it from the loudest, most visible parties. So back to the case of Rose, either racism is tolerated or not. Make your move, ESPN."
Kevin Durant leaving Steph for Kyrie.
"I don’t have an opinion here but Kevin Durant told Westbrook hours before his decision that he wasn’t leaving OKC. Paul George said that OKC was home when he signed that contract and then forced himself out of OKC a year later.  Point is, things change and people change"
Kevin Durant wanted Dillon Brooks.
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.   Cavaliers  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|49.4|37.1| |Kyrie Irving|46.8|40.5| |J.R.

"OKC as a team has horrible spacing. They were just not very well put together. They did do very well because of their two stars but ultimately wouldn't be enough.  Let's look at their rotation and shooting in the playoffs by order of minutes played.  |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |Kevin Durant|43.0|28.2| |Russell Westbrook|40.5|32.4| |Serge Ibaka|52.1|44.9| |Steven Adams|61.3|0| |Dion Waiters|41.7|37.5| |Andre Roberson|46.5|32.4| |Enes Kanter|55.1|14.3|  The only ones with respectable shooting was Ibaka and Waiters. You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R.

"The moment you have a player like Kevin Durant, you’re in win-now mode  They didn’t have a choice"
Kevin Durant on the warriors would be crazy. Imagine Steph and KD on the same team OMG! /s
The way Kevin Durant has turned heel is crazy. If he was a football player I would be convinced he has CTE...
"Kobe was one of the most clutch players of all time!  Kobe, on the otherhand, was a player who showed up really well with these playoff clutch numbers. His +141 plus/minus in 366 minutes ranks as the 2nd best career playoff mark since '97 (LeBron is #1 at +181 over 452 minutes). Kobe was an extremely skilled offensive player who was able to carry a massive role for his squad and was legendary at being able to create his own looks and was underrated as creating high quality looks for his teammates.

"TV viewers are down 50% compared to the finals 2 years ago. One would assume that Finals with Kevin Durant and Harden (NYC) against LeBron/AD or Kawhi/PG (both in LA) would draw a much bigger audience. If it is indeed manipulated for the business by the officials as you state, they are not very good at it."
"Kevin Durant was a rich man's Cade (who is consensus first pick in what looks like a loaded draft) as a freshman, and was PoTY. Oden still got picked first. Tells you a lot."
"LeBron won his first MVP when Duncan was averaging 19/11/4 and All NBA Second Team. LeBron came in 2nd for MVP voting in 2006, Duncan was still only 29 years old. Only 6 of Duncan's 19 seasons was LeBron not in the league. LeBron was also a star by his second season, so Duncan played against MVP contender LeBron for 12/19 seasons, Duncan himself was an All NBA/All Star caliber player for 8 of those seasons.  Duncan and LeBron definitely had overlap. Even Durant was averaging 30, while Duncan was making All NBA teams. And the two of them had about 6 seasons of overlap where they were going head to head for All NBA spots.  For your Kobe comparison, I'd say Steph is a little different, because they did have 7 seasons of overlap, but in those 7 seasons, Steph didn't become a star until about 2015, not to mention Kobe missed an entire season and was ass his last two years. They really didn't overlap in their primes. Same with Kyrie, who wasn't even drafted until 2011, him and Kobe had like 2-3 seasons of overlap.  As for Westbrook, he 100% counts, he was an all star caliber guy by 2010, him and Kobe were competing for All NBA spots for a number of seasons, 100% a valid comparison.  Boozer was a 2x All Star and the best player on a team that made the WCF. Sure he's not a HOF guy, but he was still a solid player who was putting up 20 &amp; 12. Marion too was nothing to scoff at. 4x All Star who peaked at 22 &amp; 12 with great defense. Kevin Love was averaging 26/13/4, finished All NBA 2nd team and had two MVP finishes. Just because these guys aren't top 10 players of all time, doesn't mean they didn't have great seasons. You're really diminishing the impact some of these guys had.   PF being a historically weak position (which is a debatable claim at that) doesn't really matter, Duncan didn't play from 1950-PRESENT so it being 'weak' in the 50s and 60s is irrelevant. He spent his prime going head to head with 4 other PFs who are consensus top 25 players of all time.  Kobe spent his prime going against solid guards, but none of whom are really considered top 25 players outside of Wade. Nash and Kidd are pretty consensus top 40 guys, as is Iverson.  You can't seriously think that 00s guards were more stacked than 00s forwards. Part of guards being worse in the 00s at least early 00s was due to handchecking rules, those being removed allowed guards to dominate more a la Deron Williams, Steve Nash, Steph etc..."
Less than LeBron in Cleveland but far far more than kevin Durant or LeBron in Miami.    Durant is a coward and loser who joined a superteam who beat his team.  I've always had zero respect for him since then.
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/amp/
https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard
Kevin's- Minnesota Timberwolves.   Where you at Durant and KPJ? We need to finish our Kevin starting 5.
"So you actually think that Kevin Durant at 180 pounds, gets listed at 7 foot as a rookie, cannot bench a bar and you think he plays center or PF in 2007 when your average PF and center had literally 100 pounds on him ?   Listed height would not change his position that's my point, not a single coach on earth would play KD at center or PF just because his official height being 7 foot"
" &gt;If the overall context is whether Curry opened up a lot for Durant, I would say that’s an easy yes.  That's not the overall context though   Secondly, you literally just disagreed with Kevin Durant and almost regurgitated what the Twitter dudes were saying  They were saying that Curry receives doubles unlike any other player in the NBA and KD was disagreeing with that and explained why"
"Huh?? Forwards were absolutely stacked in the 00s. All NBA are two forward slots, not just PF.  Dirk, Duncan, LeBron, Garnett, Pau, Stoudemire, Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Webber, Karl Malone, Barkley, Peja Stojakovic, Wallace, Vince Carter, Shawn Marion, Tracy McGrady (Houston he was a SF and was All NBA as a Forward), Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Carlos Boozer, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Blake Griffin, Paul George, Zach Randolph etc.. all competing for All NBA honors.   Forward Slots were a lot harder to attain than Guard slots in the 00s. 10s not so much, but 2000s was the era of PFs. The 5 greatest PFs of all time (Duncan, Dirk, KG, Malone, Barkley) all played at the same time, and Dirk, Duncan and KG played for nearly 15 seasons side by side.   Kobe played 2 seasons alongside peak MJ, most of his career with Wade, and missed out on almost all of Harden's prime and wasn't playing when Jerry West was active. Kobe receiving more All NBA first teams isn't so much a matter of him being better but rather his position being less stacked during his prime."
I'm convinced Kevin Durant is bipolar...
"I can't help but wonder if Kevin Durant *really* thought he was going to be ""Mr. San Francisco Bay"" after he ditched the Thunder. Perhaps he had seen LeBron win plaudits in Miami and thought he could replicate that popularity, but this seems to be one consequence of player departures: You don't get to build your reputation in an individual city, at least not anymore.  When stars move, they are no longer municipal giants; they don't inspire affection amongst the great mass of the people. Fans' fantasies are shattered, and all that remains is a cynical, transactional feeling about the player that shields both player and fan from surprise and hurt.  Curry doesn't inspire that kind of detachment. Kevin Durant does. Durant might know that now, but it probably doesn't hurt any less."
Why the hell does Kevin Durant give a shit what people on twitter and shit say he literally gets off to it
Yes. Steph did outplay kyrie after the 73-9 team added Kevin Durant.     But when it was evenly matched (even favoring the warriors slightly) kyrie thoroughly outplayed him.
Kevin Durant  Jerami Grant  Draymond Green  Bradley Beal  Damian Lillard
"They were really on Twitter lecturing Kevin fucking Durant about the game of basketball looool. The audacity. And don’t even get me started on the Warriors fan from Toronto, that dude was embarrassing (but also super entertaining lmao)."
I asked for examples of Kevin Durant making multiple salty statements towards Steph and got sent a Twitter like he claimed as an accident.   The guy in his post mentioned the like tweet and the salty comments. I am asking for the salty comments but I can see very quickly they don’t exist

The owners pay the players.  When Durant sits on at home rehabbing his achilles who is paying him?   What ticket is he selling when he sits at home doing nothing?  What tickets is Kevin Love selling while banking 40M a year?
Lebron had his career high in Miami.   Paul George just had probably his best individual post season.   Kevin Durant.   Kyrie had a 50/40/90 season. Five 40+ games  Harden had a 40 point triple double and a near 40 point triple double with BKN this year. + a bunch of 30+ point games.   Curry and Kd were still putting up 40 and 50 point games in gsw.   We still see those performances
"With someone who has as low an EQ as Kevin Durant, you can never be sure if he is defending his teammate or actually producing good basketball analysis."
"regardless of the validity of anyone's assumptions about KD's feelings or how successfully the Nets lineup worked together, i find this article very amusing: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/1/14/22231805/kevin-durant-karmic-wheel-nets-warriors-james-harden"
"Tf you on about. He literally has gone out of his way to call out these false narratives himself. It's literally exactly what he's doing. Him calling out fans for believing that false narrative, *is him calling out that false narrative.* Not to mention through every other time he's done it.   But more importantly the bs these fans believe ain't his damn responsibility. The people we have to blame are the people who believe bs and the people who spread bs.   It's the people who have such little sense of accountability that they *need* Kevin Durant himself for them not to take every rumor at face value, and even when he *does* call them out himself, you *still* get mad.   The reality is it's the fans who are mad at themselves and the media for believing whatever bs they believed. But when KD does call them out it's the fans who can't take that responsibility, and act like it's KDs fault. ""Who's to blame"" my ass."
&gt; Warriors were MAJOR fucking basement dwellers  Interesting slant to take on the subject of...*checks notes*...Kevin Durant

"You know you’re talking about Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, right ? Why are we acting like they’re scrubs who couldn’t hang with those guys ?  Appreciate greatness while it’s here my man."
"Gravity is the catch word, some folks on this sub swear that every shot a teammate of Steph hits, it's because of Steph's ""gravity"". They casually forget that Steph also plays with a guy that is at worst a Top 5 shooter ever and that his former teammate in Kevin Durant was also a 40% 3-PT shooter.  None of that was based in any evidence aswell, as Steph got more wide open shots in the regular season and playoffs than KD did during their run.  Steph is the greatest shooter ever, but people act like the difference between him and Klay Thompson is some gigantic shit, Klay legit beat Steph in a 3-PT contest before AND shoots almost the same percentage. Anyone that thinks that James Harden and Dame haven't been defended the same way Steph gets defended, is clueless."

"Almost all of those players straight up resigned with their team and got super max deals which are one of the few carrots that small market teams can offer superstars. Additionally a good amount of those players then left those teams to go to large markets. IE Steve Nash to the Lakers, Jimmy Butler from Minnesota to Miami , Dwight Howard to Lakers, LMA from Spurs to Brooklyn. Even mentioning Kevin Durant is the antithesis of your point. He joint one of the GOAT teams in the 3rd biggest market in the country.  It’s a total misnomer saying superstars pick small market teams. More often then not super stars ditch small markets to go to places where they can market themselves better or places with lower income tax."

"How is KD not better than Oscar Robertson or Jerry West?   Forget careers. There is no way you’re drafting Bill, Wilt, Magic Johnson, etc over Kevin Durant.   Bill russel and Wilt are great but please don’t tell me they’re better basketball players than Kevin Durant.   Why would I draft magic Johnson over KD when I could draft one of the top 5 scorers of all time who can also play amazing defense?"
There’s a reason he shot 76% TS in his first playoff series when teams finally couldn’t gear entire defenses to stop him  James Harden’s Houston playoff stats are identical to Kevin Durant in OKC. If Harden was the one to team up on a superteam in 2017 and won a couple rings then we would remember him a lot differently...
The warriors gentlemen swept the 8 seed rockets in 2016 without Steph so your argument just fell apart completely. They dominated Houston who had harden.  You can say this for any superteam created.   If Kevin Durant wasn’t on bkn no one would be mad harden joined them.   If wade wasn’t on Miami no one would be mad lebron joined them.
Kevin Durant. That's who
"I need Draymond, Gilbert Arenas, Kevin Durant, and Richard Jefferson to be the new TNT halftime show once these dudes retire. Maybe they can do an ESPN halftime segment?

"what's crazy to me about this situation is that y'all are blaming the warriors fan base, but as a dude that really likes KD, i've been in these same discussions on this site and fucking *all of you* have used these same talking points to shit on kevin durant.  every single time. how steph's gravity is unlike any other player in the league and the only reason kd was able to win two finals MVPs is because the other team had to spend their focus on defense on doubling steph curry because of his gravity.  and it aint coming from fucking warriors fans lol"
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe?

The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.

The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
I think both of them are bad actors. Like really bad. I enjoyed Kevin Durant in his movie. Some people yesterday also suggested me Ray Allen (haven’t watch it yet though)
"Literally says Kevin Durant in the title, dumbass. Kd is using his real name and you are using a fake name."
"I hate our owner. I don’t know why you would get the indication that I don’t. To be honest I still like James Harden, because of the way Tillman ended things.  That doesn’t make it untrue that Kevin Durant was able to make millions just by taking meetings with silicon valley executives. The boardroom is all about that. There’s a reason why tickets to see the Warriors are still some of the most expensive even with Kay injured."
"Where in there did he gameplan to double Steph every play, or double Steph and leave Kevin Durant wide open on a fastbreak? That’s a 100% conversion rate on KD’s buckets  And was this an objectively good strategy, or the better one?   The Cavs had a historically bad defense for a Finals team with a bad scheme of a lot of easy switches for easy mismatches, and sometimes they outright doubled for wide open dunks and layups. Javale feasted in the Finals because of those.  You can post a video linking Lue saying that but that doesn’t mean his scheme was to literally give the best scorer of all time wide open fastbreak buckets."
KD winning 2 more rings would not be in anyway similar to the 09-10 Lakers. It would be similar to the 12-13 Heat. People don't rate those rings Lebron had in Miami (I certainly don't). How does Kevin Durant forming another superteam cause him to jump up 5 spots?
"If Ayton became a US citizen then a 2021 team thats 100% healthy like everyone.... I would go with ..   Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Ayton.  Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, Karl Anthony Towns.  Kyrie, Booker or Zion for the last 2 spots. 12 deep."
Not if you’re a multimillionaire who wants to get even richer. Kevin Durant made millions just by taking meetings there. Is the wealthiest city on earth dude.
Kevin Durant? Seriously?   The guy above may have said New York/LA but San Francisco fucking counts.
As if an nba team thought not guarding Kevin Durant was a good strategy lmao
"So you’re basically saying the main thing russ has over CP3 is he scores more points and played with Kevin Durant. By the way, CP3 could have easily won MVP in 2008."
"I love Steph, but why are these people literally arguing with Kevin motherfucking Durant about who gets double teamed more, James Harden or Steph? Insane shit."
These kids are really arguing with Kevin fucking Durant about defense coverages that’s hilarious
You get a chance to ask KEVIN DURANT anything then yell out that like a weirdo?
Steph fans trying to explain a double team to Kevin Durant. Ok man.
Kevin Durant is dope man
they was arguing about double teams to fucking kevin durant of all people
"nah this shadow dude is a menace. Imagine telling kevin durant ""do you know my name?"""
Kevin Durant is your star player. Kevin Love should have been the Haslem/David West veteran of that team. A guy that barely gets playing time but can impart knowledge to the young ones.   You act as if he has not played for team USA before.
"What are you talking about?  The pool play is basically a round robin tourney.  Their pool has France (a few NBA players headlined by Gobert but after that, not much), Czech Republic that got in by the skin of their teeth against Canada missing Shai and Murray, and Iran.  If they have that day, it has to be absolutely apocalyptic.  In reference to the FIBA WC team, you cannot seriously compare a Derrick White to Damian Lillard or a Joe Harris to Kevin Durant.  For the rest of the world, they're still massively behind.  Sure they lost to Nigeria and Australia but they're more than likely will adjust and be better."
It was before my time as well. I just meant that more in the sense that they passed up on drafting MJ.    There’s an alternate universe where Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant go down in history as Portland players. Blazers picked huge busts one spot ahead of each
"Reminds me of another player, who’s playing third fiddle to Kevin Durant and James Harden"

"""Sources tell me Dwight Howard to the Knicks.""  ""Chris Paul to the Knicks.""  ""Kevin Durant to the Lakers.""  ""Kyrie is 95% to the Knicks.""  Just a few off the top of my head.  Look - I completely agree that Stephen A has great connections and does break info.  But please don't pretend that *ALL* of these guys would never be above blurting something out to try to be the first to break the story.  Which is what I believe happens - he's likely extremely well connected to the Knicks and his sources there feed him anything they think they have a good shot at - and he spits it out publicly."

"I have a couple nets jerseys. I’m a suns fan. I bought them for the number. Joe Johnson and Kevin Durant. Other than that, no.   Soccer jerseys on the other hand, are all over the place, and I don’t even like soccer. They’re all gifts."
o no what will Kevin Durant Damian Lillard Devin Booker Jayson Tatum and Zach Lavine do without offensive help
Kevin Durant can only score on super teams and can't create off the dribble.
"On paper, just looking at the numbers (stats and size of players), this sure looks like a blowout in the favor of the PPG team. I'd argue if you look at this a bit more deeply, it's closer than you'd think.  How would    \- James Harden during his peak of having the offense built around him work with. P.S. He's not a great defender   \- 2006 Kobe Bryant, who had the offense built around him then work with. A good defender who won't enjoy having to chase Curry and Nash   \- 1987 Michael Jordan - pre-championship and basically a one-man team who would also be working with   \- Late 1960s Wilt whose team was built around him playing with   \- 6'5"" Elgin Baylor playing power forward  versus  \- Steve Nash, who while not the best individual defender, can be effective in team defense. Plus he brings playmaking to his shooting   \- Steph Curry, was an adequate team defender who will bring a lot besides shooting   \- Larry Bird in 1986-87 (or if you count the 85-86 season where he almost had 50/40/90) was at the peak of his powers   \- Kevin Durant 2012-13 is not the player he was in 2016-17 but was hella effective with a VORP of almost 9.0 and a Box +/- of 9.3   \- Dirk Nowitzki is at a big disadvantage to Wilt but if this is played using modern rules Wilt's going to get pulled away from the basket. And that's really the point  The second team is set up well for modern day NBA rules and can be effective under those of previous eras. The thing that thought experiments like these never take into account is who would the head coach be? If Phil Jackson gets the first team, does Red Auerbach get the second?   If it's one game, it might not look great for the second team but if it's a series, that's where I'm putting my money."
"If only the US had Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Bam Adebayo to make up for that."
"In football I've seen it defined as a player who stays in the top 2-3 in the game for 10+ years, so Messi and Ronaldo for example. Of current NBA players, the current ""generational talents"" by that definition would be LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry.   The players coming through now? I can only really see Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson making it to that level."
"If we're considering having had a constant impact deep into the playoffs, I'd say the likes of Jokic, Embiid, Luka and Dame still have some work to d to make the top 5:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kawhi Leonard"
"&gt; I dont think it was on purpose, the wrap up foul was definitely a missed call but I don't assume they intentionally missed it  If they're that incompetent, it's not exactly any better than them not calling it on purpose.  Especially since these are supposed to be the ""best"" refs they have.  That's a call that even a volunteer elementary school basketball ref can make 100% of the time.  Come on, you know the NBA doesn't want their stars fouled out, especially on the biggest stage.  They did the same thing in the Nets series, when Kevin Durant got his fourth foul early in the third quarter, and convinced Nash to let him stay out there because he knew the refs wouldn't have the balls to give him his fifth that early in the game.  He proceeded to show he was right by absolutely mauling Middleton on one no-call, and I believe there was at least one more obvious one where they swallowed their whistle."
"Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Duncan Robinson gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Damian Lillard yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Durant hit the locker room door, former NBA great Jared Dudley hugged him and said, “Y’all look so defenseless.”"
"In case you are pay walled:  #Thwaaap! Giannis Blocks a Shot—and Milwaukee and Phoenix Have a Series A brilliant defensive play by the two-time MVP prevents a dunk, and NBA Finals are thrillingly deadlocked  The NBA Finals between Milwaukee and Phoenix are knotted 2-2 after Milwaukee’s impressive 109-103 come-from-behind win Wednesday. A few quick thoughts:  This is a refreshing reboot. The Bucks haven’t won a Finals since 1971. The Suns have never won a Finals. While I enjoy watching pinnacle talents like LeBron James and Kevin Durant stack their championship résumés, seeing all these new faces on the league’s biggest stage is energizing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, future Hall of Fame point guard Chris Paul—these Finals are full of first-timers with an opportunity for career-defining moments, and we’re getting a bunch of them so far.  Fresh energy is always good. The NBA built itself on starcraft and iconography—elevating names like Magic, Bird, Jordan, James, KD and Curry, but the hazard comes when the biggest stars are eliminated or injured, and the assumption is that it’s a “down” year for the sport. Not always. This series shows it.   Giannis! The low-key Middleton deserves credit for bailing out the Bucks with 40 points in Game 4, but this series has been an indelible showcase for Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP who still contends with a low frequency of grumbling that he’s not among the NBA’s peak elite. Bah: Giannis is incredible, and he’s only getting better. Antetokounmpo seemed lost for the season when he injured his knee in the Eastern Conference finals; versus Phoenix, he’s playing with characteristic relentlessness, averaging 32.2 points and 14 rebounds, and appears locked in on the chance to get Milwaukee its first title since Kareem and the Big O delivered one.  Giannis’s signature Finals moment may prove to be a spectacular defensive one: with barely a minute left in Wednesday’s game, he leapt from somewhere on the outskirts of Sheboygan to block a game-tying alley-oop dunk by an airborne Ayton. Watch it again if you can, it’s astonishing: Antetokounmpo is thoroughly beaten on the play, spun in a pick and roll, and has a foot near the free-throw line when Booker lofts the oop skyward, and yet Antetokounmpo somehow manages to track back, turn his body completely in the other direction, and leap for a perfectly clean swat above the rim of a 7-foot-1 center.   Who does such things? Basically, comic book characters, and Giannis.    Meanwhile, Middleton has been quietly essential for the whole Milwaukee run, including those two Giannis-less victories over Atlanta to get here, and dumping 38 in a crucial Game 6 victory over Brooklyn when the Bucks looked like toast. In the 29-year-old second-rounder, the Bucks have a co-headliner whose fluid, clutch scoring perfectly complements Giannis’s blunt power—these stars may be dissimilar, but that’s why they’re such a potent 1-2.   Focus on Giannis, and Middleton burns you. Switch it up, and get more of the same. The Bucks can maddeningly complicate things for themselves, but it really may be that simple.   As for Phoenix, they remain very much in this series. (it’s tied, for crying out loud!) The Suns got some early excellence from the veteran Paul (32 points in Game 1) as they raced to a 2-0 series lead, their rotation has more depth than Milwaukee’s, and they had a clear chance to jump to a 3-1 lead Wednesday. In Game 4, Booker had the thrilling, pour-it-on “Booker game” everyone had been waiting for, with 42 points—though playing with five fouls in the fourth quarter, Booker also got a miraculous reprieve from officials who missed a double-armed intentional tackling foul he made on Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday.  The NBA is a sport in which they’re now halting games for dull, FBI-style forensics on fingertip out-of-bounds plays, and they somehow didn’t see the equivalent of a QB sack.  There’s no asterisk to this title. There’s been a persistent muttering that this title will be somehow diminished because Phoenix got past some banged-up teams (the Lakers without Anthony Davis, Denver without Jamal Murray, the Clippers deprived of Kawhi Leonard) and Milwaukee barely escaped an East without a fully loaded Nets team. Please. The path to any championship is always paved with opportunism and moments of fortune, and great teams capitalize. If anything, I’d take the other side of the argument: winning a championship this season, which arrived fast on the heels of the “bubble tournament” in Orlando and began with empty stadiums due to Covid-19, is an even more striking accomplishment. No asterisks for the “bubble title,” or this one. Come on. Don’t be absurd.   I have no idea what’s going to happen here, and that’s great. Some truth in the fine print: Game 4 was the first really competitive, down-to-the-wire game of this series. As the series shifts to Game 5 in Phoenix on Saturday—thanks, basketball, for the extended delay, maybe I’ll go off to culinary school and get a degree in the interim—it’s hard to get a read on where it’s going. Phoenix’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. Milwaukee’s championship-starved crowd is at full tilt. You could argue the Bucks have momentum, but the home teams have held thus far.   Do you have a sense that one opponent has unlocked the other? I don’t, and that’s the exciting thing. There’s nothing duller than a Final with a vibe of inevitability, and there’s none here. We truly don’t know for sure who’s going to win it, and that’s the best possible sell. That, and Giannis. He’s really something else."
Kevin Durant called Jrue the best guard defender in the league
"&gt; Melo is such a bum for being selected to play on teams that included the best players in the world.  Now, see... I didn't say that. I said quoting his Olympic accomplishments isn't as big a deal as people make it out to be because he was constantly playing with LeBron, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Durant all players who were/are eons better than Carmelo Anthony was.  But I can see you're obviously upset. Chin up, sport."
"""Sexist Superstar Kevin Durant comments on his focus of the WNBA players' snatchs (box)"""
"&gt;“I enjoy watching the WNBA,” Durant told Insider. “I pretty much follow all the girls and try to keep up with the box scores and see how they are doing each night and watch as much as I can.”  Click bait headlines be like: Kevin Durant ""enjoy\[s\] watching \[...\] all the girls and tr\[ies\] to \[...\] see how they are doing each night"""
Until I see him face guard Kevin Durant for 50 minutes and hold him under 10….he’s a fake DPOTY to me
If you step out of bounds you are out of bounds until you step back in.   Just because you jump in the air when you are out of bounds doesn’t mean you are back in bounds. So in that Kevin Durant no-call he was out of bounds for 3 to 4 whole steps and never came back in. He even fell over out of bounds like 5 feet into the front row. Just cause his foot may have been in the air when he touched the ball does not mean anything.
"Giannis baskets are not the same as Kevin Durant baskets. 2 points is not 2 points, I'll explain later."
Watching Kevin Durant “dribble” a basketball hurts my brain
Kevin Durant that can dunk way better than he shoots.
Kevin Durant did it first lmao
"you have to understand how insecure curry fans are, deep down they know all he's done the last 6 years is: blow a 3-1 lead, space the floor for kevin durant, and miss the playoffs twice when he got his team back from kd"
Kevin Durant. Great player but can’t win unless he has Steph curry and klay Thompson and Dray
"Talk to someone who isn't a sports fan. They'll recognize Lebron's name like they would Jordan or Gretzky. Not Kevin Durant or ""KD""."
"Never seen a reaction to a single referee play like this before. Maybe the out of bounds on Kevin Durant was this bad, can't remember anything else coming close."
"Kevin Durant on all levels, nobody else comes close."
"The Warriors, a few years ago, were the greatest basketball team ever. Kevin fucking Durant was their third best shooter. But...  I think it did hurt the game overall. So many teams try to play that style now. Both the Suns and Bucks are so much better when they are driving, posting, shooting mid-range shots, etc."
How is that any way relevant to the Bulls vs Magic series though?  Best comparison for that MJ series would be if Kevin Durant came back from his Achilles injury for the bubble last year and the 7th seeded Nets lost to the Heat or Celtics in the conf finals. No one would hold that against KD.
"LeBron, Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Dwyane Wade, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Chris Paul, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  I don't think Dirk was even a top 10 player of the century. Some people might argue that Dirk was better than Wade and CP3, which is ok, but even if you have him over these two, there are still 10 other guys on that list."
"So dumb, I’m not even saying this as a Nets fan bc I loved KD before he came here, but we are experiencing an unreal talent in Kevin Durant, and it’s dumb that people want to troll about it because he likes to shit post on the internet like they do.   Enjoy the insane show he puts on. He loves basketball more than anything. The man lives, breathes, and shits basketball more than anyone since Jordan. He should be given way more respect."
"he averaged 20/9 last season, and I know its isnt on a Kevin Durant efficiency"
"I knew Kevin Durant was good without making up this weird comparison (excuse me, ""record"") with Michael Jordan."
Kevin Durant is a living breathing basketball cheat code
"This has nothing to do with curry, damn lol. The comment is regards to you stating ""its just a statistical fact"" as a rebuttal to who the best overall shooters in the league are.  Yes he is statistically in the top 10, but in regards to assessing who the best overall shooters are, you have to consider the types of shots they are taking. On the move, in the corner, spot up, how open they are, these are all things that need to be accounted for in an overall assessment.   Dame shot above 40% from 3 once in his career, but I would still rate Dame as a better shooter (current slump withholding) than Lonzo.   For example, Kevin Durant is shooting 40% from 3 right now, but only 43% are assisted and almost none are from the corner.  Lonzo is having a great shooting season so far and has improved dramatically, 44.7%, but 76% of his 3's are assisted, and 20% are from the corner."
"&gt; Current players J.R. Smith and Kevin Durant both liked Stephen Jackson's posts on Instagram, including the video in which he defended DeSean Jackson.  This is very weaselly worded.   Durant did not ""like"" the video where Stephen defended DeSean. He also did not ""like"" the DeSean anti-Semitic post. Rather, he ""liked"" a completely separate Farrakhan post that had nothing to do with Jews."
"Per a quick Google:  Current players J.R. Smith and Kevin Durant both liked Stephen Jackson's posts on Instagram, including the video in which he defended DeSean Jackson.  Then this week, former NBA guard Dwyane Wade stepped into the middle of controversy by expressing support for Nick Cannon, the TV host who was dropped from Viacom after making anti-Semitic comments on his podcast.  ""We are with you,"" Wade tweeted to Cannon, with an emoji of a Black fist. ""Keep leading.""  The same day, former NBA player Allen Iverson posted a picture with Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who has been deemed anti-Semitic by the Anti-Defamation League. (Both Stephen Jackson and DeSean Jackson have also expressed support for Farrakhan; Stephen Jackson commented, ""Love u bro"" to Iverson. )"

"Kevin Durant has been unstoppable from mid range this season. I think he's shooting well over 50% from there so far.  According to Basketball Reference, he's shooting 55.9% from 10-16 and an insane 71.4% from 16-3pt line."

Kevin. Durant. Missed 1 shot just to remind us he's mortal.
"I mean Curry also experiences a significant drop in efficiency in the playoffs. 2017 was the only time where he was performing up to or better than his regular season standards. And that was when he had, you guessed it, Kevin Durant on his team."

"So Scotty wants to elevate his bad back game where he scored 8 points and Jordan scored over half of the team's points to seal the sixth championship okay, well I find it interesting that he didn't bring up a certain game 7 in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals where somebody in that game had a migraine and compared to the flu game but whatever, like Kevin Durant said ""this guy Scott"" 🤦‍♂️"
"This is the same overrated player who had trouble in FIBA at first, it is that hard to score as a 6'2 guard without the no-touch rules? How about adapt your game to real basketball instead of complaining, see if a guy like Kevin Durant who has legit talent, see if he is struggling? LeBron is not struggling, Jokic, Curry, etc.. there's a difference between real talent compared to a overrated hero shooter"
2019 Clippers (8th seed that took giga-Warriors to 6 games) were the 3rd best team in the west. Had they not fucking lost a random game at the end of the season to a tanking Lakers team (Caruso had 30+ points) they would have finished a higher seed and proved it.   Also Kawhi is the second best player on the planet only behind Kevin Durant.
People talk about the NBA like Kevin Durant is still 25 years old or something. Youth doesn't win in this league. If your three best players' average age is under 27 you're simply not likely to be a good team.
"Kevin Durant is MVP, give me all the stock!"
"I don’t think the hate was bigger in 2011-12. The media didn’t want to give him a third straight mvp after switching teams, for whatever reason the move to Miami was frowned upon and they didn’t want to reward him. Kevin Durant was never going to win an mvp no matter what he did in golden state either. He got humbled by losing to Dallas and the media was more willing to give it to him his second year in Miami."
Love it. I’m in Brooklyn and I can see Kevin fucking Durant and James Harden still for 10 bucks. Only a little more expensive than the (very fun) Dlo years

TIL Kevin Durant is Lambchops_Legion.
"He'll let you down less in the Finals if you actually pay attention to how the whole system is working.  Finals Curry is like the tank in an MMO. The tank doesn't do the most damage, but their job is to soak up as much enemy attention as possible.  Steph tanks the opponents' defensive efforts. It takes everything they've got to stop Curry, and they do that... but the cost is that the rest of the team kills them.  That's why Kevin motherfucking Durant can stroll down a wide-open lane to the basket while three defenders rush an off-ball Curry at the three-point line. Teams would rather give an open dunk to *Kevin Durant* than risk Steph Curry shooting a three on the *fast break*."
Imagine if same Morris did it to Kevin Fucking Durant
"Who wins a pre-30 vs post-30 game in the NBA?   **Pre:** Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Post:** Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Nikola Vucevic."
"Magic is almost universally seen as a top 5 all-time player.  Do you think Steph has earned that seat and is the best PG of all time in the top 5 alongside the best SG in Jordan, best SF LeBron, best C Kareem?  A guy who has one championship as the best player, and no Finals MVP, is in *that* class? Is Steph even better than Kevin Durant?? How many legends are you slotting out of the top 5 for the new school?  This is like when Kobe fanatics put him in the top 5, above Shaq, when he was the second banana to him for half his career."

"Getting 50 points in 35 minutes on 28 shots?   Blows my mind.   This season, we are really seeing what separates great talent and basketball smarts from guys who just game the system.   I'm not a Trae hater. Love the guy actually. Hope he rebounds from his slow start and looks like his former self, but you see a guy like Curry who never cops out of an open shot by trying to draw a foul, and he just keeps on playing well, while the guys who relied on the rules to score are struggle. This game is a perfect contrast between the two.   Trae still had a great game. But you see how much better the guy who has always relied on talent and hard work is playing now that the rules have change. No difference whatever for Curry.   We see the same thing with Kevin Durant, though, in his case, the other end of the spectrum is his own teammate in Harden.   We see it with guys like Paul George, who is playing every bit as well as he ever has despite rule changes.   Love to see this. It's great for the game."

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."
That and they’re not actually attacking Kevin Durant the person.   They’re attacking the fictional character who entertains them during games since they’re not privy to every aspect of his personal life. It’s kinda like when people like/hate a character from a tv show/movie vs the actors themselves.
"Height is really effective in one-on-one. Kareem beat Dr. J very easily by just backing him down, and IIRC Kevin Garnett won the Team USA 2000 one-on-one tournament as well. So Shaq or Wilt Chamberlain might be able to back everyone down and score over them.  If it's not them, I'd go with Kevin Durant. I also think he might be the only player ever who could play with 4 clones of himself and have a starting five without any major weaknesses. Even Lebron would be a couple inches too short at center."

"I mean, for men, your body naturally loses testosterone and other hormones that regulate your metabolism as you age. It's not just about not twitching your legs. Literally the chemicals that determine how efficiently your body breaks down the calories you consume will dissipate as you get older. And some men see a faster and/or more severe decline than others.  And genetics also play a big role in your hormones and metabolism. Go to Wal-Mart and look at the families there. You'll see families where everyone is the same height and all have the same body type.   Zion, genetically, is always going to have to work extra hard to keep his weight in check. He can have the same caloric intake, the same amount of exercise, the same habits as his teammates, and he's still going to pack on weight easier than they will. Just like Kevin Durant would have an extremely difficult time gaining weight."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant. He's one of the most consistent superstars I've ever seen.
"if you think carmelo is better than westbrook thats just plain silly, westbrook is conserving his energy in a long 82 game season, if you know something about basketball you can see when a player is actually trying out there. let me give you an example   when you watch a player like kevin durant , when he is at his best what is he doing? yes he is pulling up from thress and mid rangers   &amp;#x200B;  when lebron is playing at his best, he is going to the rim at will and hitting fade away shots   when ad is playing his game he is blocking shots and hitting mid range shots   &amp;#x200B;  when westbrook is at his best he is going to the rim and hitting bank middies, he isnt doing that, so he isnt trying"
One of the first nba games I ever watched was when Kevin Durant hit that game winning 3 against the mavericks and I became an instant thunder fan.

"i don't think simmons had a problem with them picking rubio first, the issue was flynn  https://grantland.com/features/nba-draft-diary-2009-bill-simmons/  &gt;It took 21 minutes before someone (Fran Fraschilla) gushed about Rubio’s once-in-a-generation passing, two-steps-ahead-of-everyone timing and incredible career (playing professionally since age 14). Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is going to regret not being more excited about Ricky Rubio on June 25, 2009. More on this in a second.  &gt;4:51 — I have to come clean: If the Zombie Sonics take Rubio or Curry, they will be employing my favorite college player of the decade (Kevin Durant); my favorite international player of the decade (Rubio) OR my favorite college player of the past two years (Curry)  &gt;4:57 — In desperate need of a point guard, Sacramento takes … Tyreke Evans. It’s as if these GMs are trying to hurt me. I feel physically ill.  &gt;5:01 — The T-Wolves are on the clock with two straight; hopefully, they’re smart enough to take Rubio, or I’m going to pull out a can of whipped cream and do whip-its until I pass out.  &gt;5:03 — Phew. Sota took him. The best part: Stern going into “I’m gonna be extra gregarious right now because they’ll be replaying this in Europe!” mode as he announced the pick. Gotta say, I can’t kill Kahn for turning Randy Foye and Mike Miller into Rubio. Nice work. An orgasmic Fraschilla says Rubio is “the best passer in the last decade of drafts” and he’s “got a Gretzky-like feel, he sees the game two and three plays ahead.” Totally agree.  and then....  &gt;5:10 — So much for Minnesota doing the right thing. The Wolves just took Syracuse’s Jonny Flynn … whom I really like … but … well … he’s a point guard. Didn’t they just take Rubio? Did I black out? You’re going to have two young ball handlers playing together — one who’s 5-foot-11, the other who’s 18 years old and weighs 180 pounds (and 30 of that is his hair), and that’s your plan? Who’s guarding the Kobes and Vinces out of those two? Why didn’t they just take Curry? And why aren’t the ESPN guys wondering about a trade here or, at the very least, murdering this pick? THEY JUST TOOK TWO STRAIGHT POINT GUARDS!!!!!!!!!!"

Kevin Durant
"Not only he is basically traded for Kevin Durant, he is still Andrew Wiggins on 33 million dollar a year contract, and the Warriors are fine with that because it works decently enough for them to have a pretty ok player as their 4th max contract. Just like a year ago they were ready to pay something like 80 million dollars for one year of Kelly Oubre. Cause unlike most teams, luxury tax seems a minor inconvenience for them. I'm not sure what is the ""natural"" narrative about them exactly."
"U act like the warriors didn’t subvert the spirit of the game by signing Kevin Durant lmao, technically legal, but ruined the spirit of the game. Where’s your hate for the warriors?"
"Between the fuckhead Raptors fans defending/denying that shit despite the existence of, you know, a video record of it, and the same fuckheads downvoting anyone who points out what fuckheads they are, they're always a mess.  I do not like the current Nets but I hope Kevin Durant never loses a game in Toronto in his life."
And Kevin Durant on his team somehow angry and wide open. And there’s only 23 seconds left in the game.
I'd rather have Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
Otto Porter Jr has turned into Kevin Durant
I mean Kevin fuckin Durant better outplay a rookie lol
r/nba: Kevin Durant feels [Josh] gidd[e]y when he sees Scottie Barnes' IQ and enthusiasm.

Kevin Durant
"Funnily enough, [KD was a Raptors fan](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/)."
"#[Brooks] Kevin Durant on Jayson Tatum: ""How old is he? 19? 20? Sheesh."" Durant said Tatum’s IQ and enthusiasm for the game is “rare” for a rookie. Durant added Tatum is only going to get better."
They have James Harden and Kevin Durant. Blake Griffin corner threes were the lesser evil.
Kevin durant is a once in a lifetime type player and talent and third quarter showed y’all why
Kevin Durant..Couldnt lift weights ended up prob one of the best scorer in the history of the game
"I like him. He's real asf even if it means he's exposing himself for being insecure loll. And he has supreme confidence in his skills, just watch his 'I am Kevin Durant"" interview"
"Lol, what the fuck did you want the warriors to do? Say no to Kevin durant you moron?"
Oh lord you’re really that delusional. “We just added one player to our championship team who happened to be a top 15 player of all time.”  While we traded away our best player for another better player. We didn’t add a HOF to our existing team.   Also yea I fucking hate the Bulls and Lakers for that too bud. They were so obviously better than the competition that it wasn’t fair. But people don’t hate them as much because their fans somehow still aren’t as insufferable as you whiny Warriors fans bitching all the time.   Your team did a great job at building a good roster. You got rewarded for it in 2015 and almost in 2016. And then you added Kevin Fucking Durant to your 71 win team without giving up anything. “wE DraFTeD AlL oUr PlAYErs ExcePt ONe”
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
You can't spell KevIn DurAnt without AI.
"Kevin ""Supa Hot Fire"" Durant: ""First of all, I'm not a role model"""
Many fans and execs are hoping Kevin Durant violently brings him out to pasture.
"The Warriors like to collect former MVPs:  * Kevin Durant, 2014 NBA MVP * JaVale McGee, 2012 &amp; 2013 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Juan Toscano-Anderson, 2018 LNBP MVP * Otto Porter Jr., 2015 Shaqtin' a Fool MVP * Nemanja Bjelica, 2015 EuroLeague MVP"

Should Kevin Durant be included in that or no?
Guarded like they did Kevin Durant
Bobby Portis is just Kevin Durant with normal ankles.
Bobby Portis' comp is actually Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant gonna make a fake account and start sending subliminal subtweets at ya for this comment.
That would be Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant scares me
Celtics can have the W please don’t injure the best player in the nba kevin durant too fun to watch … currently curry is better this season but if durant is healthy he is the best
Weird how Kevin Durant and James Harden can put away bad teams
If you had to give the Nets two all-stars this year isn't it clearly Kevin Durant and Patty Mills
"If my goal is to win a basketball game for my life I’m just choosing the best most talented players ever who can mild into just about any scheme or systems. This is gonna skew hard to modern players from within the last 30 years also it’s 2021 and this is the era of position-less basketball so I’m gonna put players at whatever position I want to       Guards- Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Klay Thompson   Forwards- Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Bird  Bigs- Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Giannis    Just crazy defensive versatility with this team and it’s full of shooting and elite interior scoring. Lots of players who can create a mid range and I wanted a large collection of stars who can also play well off the ball and can have impact if they aren’t touching the ball much."
"Whenever you devise a metric, you always want it to spew out like 90% what you'd expect and 10% you didn't.   Unrelatedly, the top 6 in EPM are   1. Nikola Jokic  2. Steph Curry  3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo  5. Kevin Durant  6. Gary Payton II  Who would have expected Durant to be up there?"
"What? in such a weak center era he wouldn't be an all-star? he had all-time great potential, it's not for nothing that 29 teams would have taken him over Kevin F\*\*\*ing Durant"
This is a big reason why tony Allen was so effective. He will try his very best to deny you getting the ball and keep you from getting to your spot. He is the only person to defend Kevin Durant well because it was such a risk to get the ball in durants hands.
"Giannis faced kevin durant on Opening Night and beat him in that game. I know it is a regular season game but Kevin Durant has an MVP player in James harden while giannis has khris Middleton. In my opinion, Giannis is better because if you look at his teammates none of them are in the top 10 player list in the NBA both lebron and kd has anthony davis and james harden. Im not trying to disrespect khris Middleton but the man is inconsistent imagine if giannis had a top 10 player that fits his playing style that is consistent like jayson tatum who is close to being top 10 nobody in the east or NBA is beating the bucks. Giannis can carry a team better kevin durant needs MVP and all star caliber players on his team to succeed"
Kevin Durant if you get on his bad side
"He was only ever like that when he had Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant getting all the attention, and Russ was feeding him easy shots at the rim."
"Alright, you caught me. It's me, I'm actually Kevin Durant."
Well your kids some bum ass bitches. You gotta raise them with some respect. Imagine not recognizing Kevin Durant as the goat. And this is coming from a person who is not KD
"Kevin ""Charles Barkley"" Durant"
KD went from being The Servant to being The Serpent.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/1963239-kevin-durant-chooses-the-servant-as-nickname-to-replace-slim-reaper.amp.html
In what world is Kevin Durant a top 10 all time player?
"I am a life long MSU/Magic/Lakers fan, but became a warriors fan when Draymond Green got drafted. I went on to be a Curry fan. I hate that Kevin Durant left the Warriors but also hate that he made it obvious that he was better than Curry, while they were teammates.  I have long hated James Harden for on-court reasons. Among my favorite recent NBA moments were the warriors beating the Rockets in the playoffs. I have long hated Kyrie Irving for off court reasons.  I like rooting for the Nets to implode even more than I liked rooting for the Rockets to implode."
"Well actually, they’re called season-ending injuries, and they effect how you play after you return for a period of time unless you’re Kevin Durant who’s a top-10 all time player.  If KP remains healthy he will not only return to his Knicks form, but he will be far more seasoned and impactful."
"I don't really think that's true. The Warriors have signed multiple FA All Stars in the last decade in David Lee, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, David West, etc.   Yes Curry has played a big part, but you're *severely* underrating organizational culture. GS wasn't an GA destination pre-Curry because Cohan was a god awful owner. Joe Lacob is legitimately one of the best in the league, and players trust that the organization will put together a winning roster. That matters to players."
Kevin Durant and even Lebron to an extent are not all time great players because they teamed up with peers to win a ring. How hard is it really to look across the league and pick the best players to join?  KD will never be a top 10 player all time in my book and Lebron is still way behind MJ…
"I guess Jason Terry is a better scorer than Tracy McGrady I guess or does that seem ridiculous because maybe where a player lands in terms of totals doesn't have bearing on how great of a scorer they are. Theres so many examples of how that logic is flawed. Vince Carter &gt; Larry Bird or Zach Randolf &gt; Dr. J or John Stockton &gt; The Admiral. Kevin Durant is unlikely to ever catch Karl Malone I guess he's not as good. On that note, do you also think that Karl Malone is the second greatest scorer of all time among all retired players?"
Kevin Durant speaks Parseltongue
"&gt;Antjuan Lambert, who is listed in the Nets media guide as director of team security.   &gt;   &gt;Lambert worked in a similar position with Golden State for a season when Durant played for the Warriors, according to his LinkedIn page. Lambert at one time also served as Durant’s personal bodyguard, according to The Athletic.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/nets/2021/06/12/nets-security-guard-reprimanded-shoving-pj-tucker-altercation-kevin-durant/7672368002/"
I don’t want Kevin Durant to win another ring
How is that a decline? He’s literally just scoring less because he’s got Kevin fuckin Durant there to take the scoring load.
I wish that all players who would be considered skinny for their position had they played in the 90s or 2000s be kicked out of the league. Tired of seeing centers who look like and try to play like Kevin Durant.
Seattle Supersonics fan here. I hope Kevin Durant never wins another thing of meaning unless he returns to Seattle. And I should note for the record that I love him and always will.
"yall got me googling ""Kevin Durant legs"" cmon man"
Kevin “Sensitive” Durant
"I would like LeBron to win another ring this year. Just to see everyone bring up the GOAT Convo again. Beat the Nuggets when Murray comes back, then the Clippers when Kawhi comes back, then the 70-12 Warriors with Klay back in the Conference Finals. Then the Nets in the championship with Kyrie back with Kevin Durant and James Harden, after KD wins League MVP."
"\[Kevin Durant\] Spending all day on twitter is great and totally normal! I absolutely love interacting with my fans there. Truly, I can't imagine why anyone would suggest spending my free time reacting to anonymous strangers tweets about me would be a bad idea."
"I would also like to see Westbrook and Harden win a ring to rub salt in the wounds of the two MVPs they drafted winning elsewhere.  Kevin Durant, as you will recall, was drafted by Seattle.  I'm not a Sonics fan, but fuck OKC for stealing that historic franchise to move it out into the dust bowl."
u/Mr_Mojo18 would like to apologize to Celtics fans in advance once Kevin Durant clicks on this thread and scores 71 points tomorrow night
"For better or worse, KD plays methodically to get the best shot he seeks.   I think it was the “I’m Kevin Durant” interview game"
"Nah, Kevin Durant is highly efficient and probably the most efficient out all the players listed here."
"I never suggested I felt strongly about the Kings trajectory. I just pointed out that this person was misinformed about everything they said.   Eg. they said we don't have any 3pt shooters aside from Hield, but Barnes is shooting 40% from 3 on 5 attempts per game. He has made more than Kevin Durant this season. They said Haliburton's 3pt shooting last season was a fluke and they'd be shocked if he makes 35% with defenses paying attention to him this season - he's currently at 38%. They said we overpaid Whiteside last season even though we gave him a one year minimum because he isn't even worth an NBA roster spot, but he's playing a significant role for one of the best teams in the league this season.  We stink and it's fair to say we stink. But don't present the reasons we stink as facts if you don't know them."
"As a first generation Asian-American who spends plenty of time in circles with native born Asians, plenty of them only know Jeremy Lin for his ethnicity. The fact of the matter is that yes, Jeremy Lin, was born in California, but he's more prominent in the public eye of most Asians because he's Taiwanese-American. My Korea-born dad who doesn't know who James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, or Dwight Howard are knows who Jeremy Lin is."
"Kevin ""The Ashy Assassin"" Durant."
"I hope the Raptors miss the playoffs for a decade.  It’s pure pettiness, but… - They gave us our most painful playoff loss maybe ever and **gloated** over it for years. - They used that loss to relentless call Giannis a choker and paper MVP - They were somehow simultaneously just as relentless about our “choker” ditching us for Toronto, where he would of course be a legitimate superstar - The whole goddamn Kevin Durant thing - Borderline delusion about being a “championship franchise” when they were just carried to a ring by Kawhi and a historic collapse from GSW   You asked for petty.  Don’t tell anybody I fucking love Scottie Barnes."
Kevin durant has never won a real ring
"I never want Kevin Durant to lead his own team to the championship and I want the loss to be as painful as possible losing Game 7 of the finals or getting upset in the first round, something like that"

Ricky out rebounding Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin to this point 🤣🤣🤣
"Do you watch NBA games or look just look at BBall Ref. Watch games.   Because the starters are better than the bench unit. Russ’s net rating is not solely based off of his time running with the starters whereas harden and PG played more with the starters because of Russ’s reputation as a floor raiser  Is Reggie Jackson/Andre Roberson/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Steven Adams a stacked team? No, it only through the addition of another superstar that they become stacked"
Kevin Durant easily takes the cake.  *Why aren’t any of these dude’s like KD?*
"The push on Kevin Durant during one of the NBA finals game between OKC and Miami. I remember you could see Westbrook yell ""thats a foul!"" on the replay. It was clear push with one hand while KD was mid air shooting the ball.  I only remember that the game was really close and may have swung the series in favor of the Thunder."
tall skinny guy throws ball in the vicinity of the basket = next kevin durant
James Harden and a Kevin Durant
"This is the 4th consecutive season Westbrook’s team has had a negative net rating with him on the court without the teams best player.   When Westbrook was in his prime without Kevin Durant (easily a top 20 player of all time, perhaps will end his career as a top 10 player) the Thunder were only at the level of a low seeded playoff team."
Ah yes Kevin Durant the notorious anti 3 point shooter
"I hate to link the NYpost, [but this is how people were talking about Wiggins pre draft.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2013/11/02/andrew-wiggins-dealing-with-lebron-type-hype/amp/)   I never heard people talking about Zion like he was going to be a top 5 player all time.  &gt;	CBS analyst Doug Gottlieb sees Wiggins as a cross between James, Kevin Durant and Tracy McGrady, with Wiggins’ athleticism unlike anything Gottlieb has seen since Kevin Garnett came out of high school in 1995.

"Look, there's a difference between when you think you're gonna marry a girl and she leaves you for another dude, and when a girl leaves her boyfriend for you and you know going in she's gonna leave you for another guy one day. How you get 'em is how you lose 'em.  I still think Thunder fans are a little in the wrong, because he played his best while he was there and say what you like about Kevin Durant, that man plays out his contracts, he doesn't sign a long deal and then force his way out. I think KD deserves significantly more respect for that alone than any of the stars who've forced trades.  KD also did us a solid - one that was of benefit to him too, but still a solid for us too - on his way out, to be fair. The S&amp;T for KD got us D'Lo, who in turn got us Wiggins and Kuminga, and we appreciate that too.  But I genuinely think fans are being entitled if they complain about players leaving in free agency. A player owes you nothing after the conclusion of their contract."
That is false all his teams he was on were better before him and made them regress. Hence why empty stats.   The thunder were better with Kevin durant. The rockets were better with cp3 and harden. The wizards are better without him this year while the Laker struggle...
"Dawg, I am only saying he is inconsistent on offense not “god awful” which is ambiguous at best. I’m not saying he’s Kevin Durant or anything remotely close, just that he’s inconsistent."
&gt;You actually thing the pre-KD warriors are a greater roster than any KD warriors team?  Bro its really obvious they are saying 2016 warriors had the best regular season of all time. No one thinks the warriors got worse when they added Kevin Durant.
"Hard to say, KD is the best player between the 2 teams, but this version of Harden is probably just slightly below that version of Kidd. Past that though, I think K.Mart and peak Richard Jefferson are better than everybody else on the current Nets. 00's Nets are a more well put together team, but then there's Kevin Durant. Nets in 7."
Warriors had a 28 point swing in the 4th just the other day. They've given up leads like that multiple times. 22 points in the third is not over especially when the other team can put in Kevin Durant and James Harden.
This Kevin Durant kid seems to have a pretty good head on his shoulders.
"2x MVP and DPOY? Averaging 28/12/6 for the last 4-5 years while being one of the best defensive players?   I love Durant, he’s my favorite player,  but using the “ringz” argument in favor of him is stupid. He joined the 73-9 team that beat him. The Greek’s one title and FMVP  is worth both Durants combined…  Any combination of curry, Kevin and Giannis is fair and will get no argument. But saying Giannis isn’t even in the same conversation as them? Gtfo"
"Why would Kevin Durant even enter the debate at the same time as Curry?    Let him win a ring on his own first?    Like he has been one of the top-3 players of the past decade, no doubt - but Curry &amp; Lebron's careers seem half a notch better at this point."
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry Era
The Kevin Durant Steve Ballmer one remains too stupid for me to really believe it wasn’t parody.
List is pretty funny if you only focus on one attribute at a time:   Nikola Jokic - the MVP is not winning the 100M dash any time soon  Nikola Vucevic - has the vertical leap of your favorite pet turtle   Zion Williamson - forgot that appetite was part of “body control”  Kevin Durant - your grandma can out-bench press him… [seriously](https://hoopshype.com/gallery/kevin-durant-players-bench-press-nba-draft-combine/)
"So youve got Steph Curry and Kevin Durant at the top above him.  Competition for 3rd is tight. Looking into it thoguh, yeah, he is right there. He is a lethal do it all scoring package. Shooting, Handles, quickness on the drive. His 3 ball is so ridiculous and smooth.  I'm not ready to just move Harden off the podium just yet. Harden has not been good this year, but I've gotta give him half a season before I take him off that podium."
"Wilt averaged 30/5/22 for his career, therefore Wilt &gt; MJ.....that doesn't make sense does it? it's more nuanced than that.  MJ never had to face a 73-win warriors + Kevin Durant did he?  &gt; No one in their right mind would ever say that about MJ.  MJ never took plays off? MJ never had a bad game? MJ never got beat off the dribble? Did you even watch MJ or have you just seen his FreeDawkins highlights lol? Come on man.  &gt; My man gave up and walked off the court with like 5 minutes left in a playoff game last year. We gonna forget that quickly?  That has nothing to do with talent level as a player, and you know it. Seems pretty obvious to me at this point you have a personal bias toward MJ/against LeBron and you're arguing in bad faith.  I think MJ is the GOAT, but i acknowledge that LeBron is close in terms of talent and playoff performance. You're acting like it's not even close."
"He literally had 2 playoff runs where he was legitimately playing better than Kevin Durant (2014,2016) Westbrook is a volume scorer, Durant isn’t. KD plays through the offense that was mostly run by Westbrook. Durant was the best player on the team for sure but you can’t really consider Russ to be a complementary player with the kind of play style he has. He needs the ball in his hands to be effective and they were winning a bunch of ball games playing like that. OKC didn’t win the big one due to a myriad of reasons, but that’s just how it was."
"When you have Kevin fucking Durant on your team, and you take more shots than him with way way less efficiency, then I'm sorry but no amount of triple doubles can make up for that net negativity."
"&gt;Even a lakers fan   &gt;   &gt;Then and only then did being in a big market helped.  Lmao did you expect him to have an issue all 7 of top 15 players that changed teams recently play in NYC and LA right now?  Also, well, I guess them NYC and LA front offices are just THAT good, aren't they? They got 7 out of 7!  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;big markets beats little markets in the NBA  Good, so just say it and stop pretending you turned LeVert into KD because ""good FO"" when it was just [arranged between the players](https://www.sportscasting.com/why-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-decided-brooklyn-nets/)"
"I love kd. Dude is a spider demon born in a lab to be the perfect basketball player. Appreciate everything he did for us. But no one escapes being made fun of. Not kd, not Curry, not Klay.  Harden has been one of the most effective basketball players of all time over the last couple of years. Hall of famer for sure. No denying that. But also, this year’s rule changes have effected his game more than almost any other player in the league. So much of his game is built around both foul baiting and the space that the fear of fouling him creates.  Players in the league absolutely appreciate the effectiveness of his game. But I’m sure they also share the fan’s frustration with it. It’s more than just how you feel about playing against other good players. If KD rains jumpers on your head you just shake your head and shrug. There’s nothing you can do. He’s Kevin fucking Durant. If Harden hooks your arm and gets to the line you - and your fans - feel cheated.  So let’s see how we look back on Harden and his game in a couple of years. Is he still a top of the line, too 5 player in the game type of superstar under these new rules? I think it’s fair to question that. And given the frustration that style of play causes in folks, I think you can expect a lot of cheerleading his demise if it turns out he isn’t that anymore."
"Okay so the Nets have a superteam because they made good moves, that's what you're saying? That's weird. I thought our FO has been very good lately, why couldn't we sign anyone even though we were in the ECF 3 seasons ago and already had Giannis? Must be our logo, it's probably ugly. FOH.  Nobody said the Nets are some kind of powerhouse. What I said is even though they SUCKED, 2 years later they got 3 superstars playing for them. And [here's how](https://www.sportscasting.com/why-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-decided-brooklyn-nets/). And don't get me started on the Lakers signing LBJ and AD forcing a trade there. Y'all need to gtfo of this thread fr with these flairs."
this makes me wonder what kevin durant looked like in high school.
Ah the Kevin Durant way
"&gt;Wall should have been shutdown because he was also injured.  Maybe, but he was still taking a high amount of shots as the season progressed.  And both of those guys were much better options than when Wall was trying his best Kevin Durant impression halfway through the season  Wall was probably the worst net negative player on high volume last season, like he should not have been taking those shots at all  I remember the Wolves game where Wall was basically the Wolves best player and threw away the win  Idk anyone who watched the Rockets last season, and thought that Wall needed to play that selfishly to win games"
Nah that’s just a huge range that’d insinuate hes closer to 30 than he is to 10….like imagine if I said Kevin Durant a top 30 player ever
"I think the title of best player in the world is actually pretty far from unanimous right now, a lot of people pick Kevin Durant, a lot of people still pick LeBron, you'll even see some people pick Stephen Curry, but I think the Greek Freak has the strongest case right now"
Magic Johnson Michael Jordan Kevin Durant Tim Duncan Hakeem Olajuwon
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and 4 unprotected firsts"
MVP: Kevin Durant  MIP: Robert Williams  DPOY: Giannis  6MOTY: Patty Mills  ROTY: Mobley
"Russ has had Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal maybe the best PG13 season ever and none of them wanted to stay with him or won a championship"
Kevin Durant. Warriors move made me dislike him a lot. But seeing him carry the Nets in the playoffs changed my mind.
MVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Rudy Gobert  MIP: Jaren Jackson Jr  6MOTY: Lou Williams  ROTY: Jalen Green
"I mean Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving are Nets. How do you think I feel?"
"Kevin Durant, thought he was a massive pussy and snake but he's actually fucking crack up and doesn't give a fuck"
"Kevin Durant because I think hes better, winning doesnt make someone better or worse its really only information you should use if you have no clue how to tell if a player is better or worse than someone else. its close though"
"Saying KD is ""slightly better"" than  Tim Duncan on offense is an insult to KDs all time talent or an extreme overrating of Duncan's offensive ability. Knowing r/nba its probably both.  There is literally  no stat, metric or anything in any way that would suggest Duncan is even close to Kevin Durant on offense. Never sniffed a scoring title, never was an efficient shooter, extremely limited offensive skillset. Didn't have much  above the rim game even for a big man. Slow in transition.  Duncan is no where near KD on offense."
"Kevin Durant passed Duncan back in 2017 or 2018, he just was on shittier teams his entire career (Duncan had a super team his entire career basically)"
"Cool. Mamba mentality says that superstars should warrant it, Kevin Durant (superstar) says it’s lame shit. Both Kobe and Gilbert are understanding that mamba mentality is going against the conventional etiquette of an open gym run, that they want doubles. Gilbert was also a ball hog and that notoriously limited his game, he didn’t want doubles to pass out of them and make the right play. But even then, you’re telling me y’all are giving a pass to Noah, DLo, and those guys for having to double a 22 year old, 0 time all star DBook in an open gym? The thing that Gilbert and Kobe recognized to be doubled was to be recognized as a superstar, and they should want that. DBook wasn’t at that level, and even then KD still thinks it’s lame.   You don’t double in open gym unless there’s a clear understanding that one player is above the rest. Booker chose to play against NBA level guys in an open gym so that the playing field was level enough that he wouldn’t have people doubling him in a pick up game. It’s lame that those guys couldn’t hold a 22 year old Devin Booker, he’s in the same league as them and was a 0 time all star. If you can’t guard him, pick someone else who does a better job."
"For most of the “normal” guys who don’t party hard socialite style, probably. He seems like the type of guy to shoot the shit after the game, while also being committed and smart enough to hold good BBall conversations with the Kevin Durant types."
"So it was dead then, but it's apparently alive now despite the fact that Brooklyn seems to have constructed a similar team but with more depth? Unless Kyrie goes crazy and shoots Kevin Durant for keeping a globe in his locker or Harden gains 50lbs from eating too many strip club chicken wings, they're winning the title. Who's going to stop them?"
Kevin Durant.  Last season in the playoffs pushed me to the other side. Dude did everything he could do so I'm into the hype.
"LeBron in close out vs Phoenix: 29-9-7, 13pt loss  Booker in close out vs LA: 47-11-3, 13pt win.  Didn't seem like LeBron was the best player in the playoffs this year. Did you even watch Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo?"
Kevin Durant is better until proven otherwise
Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant,  He joined the Warriors to get his two rings, but his skill is undeniable. His play in the Olympics reminded me what it was like when I liked him in the Thunder. Still don’t want him to beat my team of course, but I respect him."
Kevin Durant. He's on my favorite team now
Where’s Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant. Still not a fan of the Warriors decision but he’s an all timer, and we need to enjoy players like that while they’re playing. I learned this because of my other player I disliked (more like indifferent to), Kobe Bryant. I started becoming a big fan his second-last year in the league when I was fortunate enough to see him play in person."
"Kevin Durant, I don't like the decisions he makes but he is amazing at basketball, and at least very sincere."
"Kevin Durant. I was a big Oden fan, hated him on the Thunder, HATED him on the Warriors, but now...he's in Brooklyn"
"It’s just a different game today. My argument is that Jordan’s skill set may not necessarily translate like people think. Would he be the best in the league, most certainly. But who knows if he’s out to better numbers, he’s probably not winning as many championships in todays league. Similarly, Kevin Durant may have gotten man handled back then."
"Jordan could probably average 40 in today’s nba. Your comment is ridiculously short sighted.   Jordan was a freak athlete even by today’s standards, and much more all around skilled than most of today’s stars WITHOUT modern training.   Yes the genetic pool is better in today’s league but overall skill by today’s players is comparable. Today’s players come into the league raw, with little solid coaching and team training. Players only spend 4 years in college if they aren’t draft able freshman year.   Anyone of Beal, Westbrook, Durant, Curry, AD, luka, harden, lavine, Giannis, Lebron would be capable of averaging 40 if that’s the only goal they had.   You can watch era bridge players like Kevin Garnett or Kobe dominate in multiple eras. Would kobe not be able to dominate the league? Didn’t he play against many of the same players MJ dominated?   You are being a bit too hyperbolic and tunnel visioned with your thought process. You are being very liberal with your definition of evolution.   Would Barkley, shaq, Hakeem, bird, Stockton, Kareem, GP, magic, pippen, D Rob, kobe, Malone… not be good players in the league today?"
2022 Finals Potentially crushes all  PG Kyrie Irving  SG James Harden  SF LeBron James  PF Kevin Durant  C Anthony Davis  SF PF can go either way
Personal fav : Boyfriend and I were making out in his treehouse and it was very passionate. Sadly it all ended when he heard a Weird sound. I asked what’s wrong Daddy and he screamed “Look there’s a snake in the treehouse! I laughed and said that’s Kevin Durant the Traitor. Shame on you🐍😡
Kevin Durant. He’s only good at basketball.
"Yes you are wild for thinking that. Luka will get better as a player but there is only so much better those box score stats can realistically get    I think the true evolutions he makes to his game will be things like his defense, making a higher percentage of threes and extending his range further. He could add more variety to his mid range and maybe even post game even though he is already pretty good at both.   He’s just gonna learn to be a better two way player and a more efficient superstar.    Lebron James was a way better between 2013-2018 than he was between 2005-2010 but he didn’t improve statistically that much. Same thing applies to Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, etc  Guys who come into the league and become MVP caliber players at 20-21 years old rarely ever end up improving their raw box score stats that much."
* 1980-1982: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * 1982-1983: Moses Malone * 1983-1984: Larry Bird * 1984-1987: Magic Johnson * 1987-1993: Michael * 1980-1982: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * 1982-1983: Moses Malone * 1983-1984: Larry Bird * 1984-1987: Magic Johnson * 1987-1993: Michael Jordan * 1993-1995: Hakeem Olajuwon * 1995-1998: Michael Jordan * 1998-2003: Shaq * 2003-2007: Tim Duncan * 2007-2009: Kobe Bryant * 2009-2019: LeBron James * 2019-2020: Giannis Antekumpo * 2020-currently: Kevin Durant   Format like this
"Kevin Durant is better overall, Giannis won due to injuries. Had Nets been healthy in series against Bucks, they win it."
"Kobe didn’t say a single thing about Booker’s mentality, he just said he personally wants the double. You have Gilbert Arenas and Jameer Nelson, DBook has Trae Young, Kevin Durant. Both of those two stars talked about how doubling is some hoe shit and “only a few would understand.”   I’m saying most hoopers because anecdotally every dude I hoop with who played legit college ball all agreed with Book except 1. If someone who actually hoops doubled in a open gym, I’d be fucking shocked. Literally have only seen that when playing with guys who don’t hoop"
"""He allowed"" that? What, was he supposed to say ""no, I don't want Kevin Durant on my team""?"
The league became goofy after that year. There's no way Kyrie and James Harden should be on the same team as Kevin Durant in Brooklyn. And Westbrook on the same team as AD and Lebron...on the Lakers. They are driving away fans like me.
People say this like he didn’t have a noticeably better game and overall series than Giannis.   If Joe Harris doesn’t turn into Andre Roberson minus the defense that series we’re looking at 3x NBA Champ and FMVP Kevin Durant.
I’d say there’s a pretty clear top-5. In any order.   Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Steph Curry  Kawhi Leonard  LeBron James  I’d probably have Durant and Kawhi 1 and 2 but the margins are incredibly slim and I’m not mad at any argument for a different guy at the top spot.
2022  * PG: James Harden * SG: Kyrie Irving * SF: Lebron James * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Anthony Davis
Kevin Durant for sure
Kevin Durant!
"Kevin Durant, with Giannis as a close second.   I don’t mind anyone picking Giannis—partly out of homerism, and in larger part because he’s closed the gap that much with his legendary Finals—but he gets romanticized too much for winning it all. If not for KD’s overlong shoe on that would-be game-winning three, would this even be a discussion?  I haven’t forgotten how KD outplayed Giannis head-to-head; I lost count of how many times my heart dropped after his daggers in that Bucks-Nets series."
Kevin Durant can fit in this space.
"I don't think KD is worried about what he can do in whoever's Arbitrary ""all time ranking"". Pretty sure he wants to win a chip right now. But I can't speak for the man aint like I'm Kevin Durant answering this dumb ass question from an alt. - Kuvin Derant"
You draft Kevin Durant and now Shane battier is upset he’s coming off the bench and thinks his role should be upgraded
"Well yeah but they also had Kevin Durant for 3 years, and elite bench for a couple years, Prime Klay, Prime Draymond. It's a lot different now."
Yeah and that trade is getting Kevin Durant
It’s Kevin Durant man…….   The one athlete that “dude he doesn’t read his messages” doesn’t apply to
adding kevin durant to the best team ever is not unnecessary hate
"I’m a 6’ overweight middle aged white guy who hasn’t played any competitive ball in 20 years. He’s Kevin Durant. In a game of 1 on 1, I could take him."
No he's Kevin Durant.
"At least Kawhi won a ring for the Spurs before he dipped, unlike Kevin ""Can't Win With These Cats"" Durant"
"Oddly enough, I also can't text Kevin Durant and can only communicate through Instagram"
"Brooklyn or OKC.    Warriors KD will always be just 3 of the worst nba years ever where KD joined an all time great team that was capable of winning the championship without him and he decided to hop on the bandwagon for easy rings.     When I think of KD I used to think about his 2011-2016 playoff runs and all the great battles he had with teams like Memphis, San Antonio, Dallas, etc   When I think of warriors KD I remember an all time great talent who was scared of adversity and got the defensive attention of a role player despite being an all time talent.   Last year was the best Kevin Durant I ever seen and straight up the best basketball player I have ever seen except for 2013-2018 lebron James and early 2000s shaq. If we see more playoff runs like that I’m gonna accociate KDs legacy with Brooklyn because it’s the best version of himself"
the next Kevin Durant
and then they morphed together into kevin durant
"I would not consider them as hated as the Zaza example you gave out, but Kevin Durant, James Harden and Paul George"
Mf you think KEVIN DURANT is an AVERAGE DEFENDER lmaoooooooooooooooo
"I think the Warriors should get rid of this Ezeli guy and sign, uh , let's say Kevin Durant"
"Lmaooooo Australians and Europeans are way better basketball fans.   You guys look at travels and step backs and think it’s awesome. You guys were a Kevin Durant away from not even getting a medal at the olympics lol. The rest of the USA roster when out together was junk. It took KD (the best player on the planet) to single handedly beat us.   American players and fans just like toxic hoops. That’s why guys like Kobe and all the good skills coaches who don’t slut for likes on Instagram say that euro and Aussies are good prospects. We watch, scout and play the game properly. All Americans do is jump really high."
the issue is almost none of that was done off the dribble. he had no on ball creation and relies on jokic to create shots for him.  now his potential is kevin durant high but learning how to dribble a basketball when your that tall can be challenging to say the least/

&gt; flaming out miserably  ECF is flaming out miserably? Aight lol  &gt; one great playoff run  Giannis won a ring as the best player on the team. Here is a list of the only other players to do that within the last 10 years:   -LeBron James  -Kawhi Leonard  -Kevin Durant  -Steph Curry  -Tim Duncan  That's it. That's the list
Kevin Durant seems chill af
Draymond Green says at one point Kevin Durant blocked his number and they only talked on Instagram    loll
Case in point: Kevin Durant.
"Festus Ezeli locked eyes with his point guard, leaped past two defenders and threw down an alley-oop dunk.  It was late September, and Ezeli — more than 4 ½ years removed from his last NBA game — was playing pickup in Sacramento. As he followed that alley-oop with chase-down blocks, offensive rebounds and putback dunks, he realized that, for the first time since knee issues had ended his professional career at just 27, he was moving with ease. Gone were the fears about stepping the wrong way and aggravating an injury.  Finally, Ezeli told himself, the time had come to contact teams in hopes of returning to the NBA. When the G League season starts next week at a bubble environment in Orlando, Ezeli will be part of a waiver pool that allows franchises to claim him. At any point over the following month or so, he could receive a call from someone asking him to pack his bags, board a flight to Florida and play his first pro game in nearly half a decade.  At age 31 with an extensive injury history, Ezeli is an unlikely member of basketball’s striving class. In 2016, while with the Trail Blazers after the Warriors renounced his rights in order to sign Kevin Durant, he was diagnosed with a defect in the cartilage of his left knee. Doctors told Ezeli that he needed experimental surgery. His playing days almost certainly seemed over.  As Ezeli spent six months post-surgery confined to a wheelchair and relying on help to use the bathroom, he sank into a deep depression. Basketball had become fundamental to his identity. Without it, he felt lost.  “Depression is an understatement,” Ezeli said of that dark period. “Until that point, I never understood the importance of mental health. … But not being able to walk on your own for half a year, you definitely become close friends with depression.”  After Ezeli underwent surgery on his right knee and missed the 2013-14 season, he helped Golden State win the 2015 title. Little more than a year later, fresh off careerhigh averages in points (7), rebounds (5.6), blocks (1.1), minutes (16.7) and field-goal percentage (54.8) for a team that reached the Finals, he signed a two-year, $15.2 million deal with the Trail Blazers in free agency.  “The trajectory of my journey has always been about overcoming seemingly impossible odds,” Ezeli said. “I mean, I went from getting cut from my high school team to playing meaningful minutes in the Finals.  Ezeli was waived by the Trail Blazers in June 2017 without playing a game for them. As he built up the muscle in his left leg and re-learned how to walk, he went two years without shooting a basketball. In that time, the NBA embraced a position-less style, prioritizing speed and versatility over size.  Traditional centers like Ezeli were replaced by basketball unicorns: interior defenders who also can hit 3-pointers, pass and guard any position. Even Ezeli’s close friends and family encouraged him to consider other career options.  Genial and articulate, Ezeli could find success in broadcasting. There also was the economics degree from Vanderbilt he had yet to use.  His message of perseverance resonated with many who hadn’t even followed his career. In April, Ezeli created an Instagram page with the handle “@RebuildingTheBeast” and invited people to share their stories of resolve. In less than 10 months, the account has featured more than 300 posts about everything from living with physical disabilities, to dealing with personal tragedy, to navigating mental health issues.  The Instagram page has nearly 3,000 followers. Ezeli plans to soon publish a “Rebuilding The Beast” podcast series, with interviews from people who’ve overcome personal challenges. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, whose father was assassinated in 1984 by two gunmen outside his office in Beirut, is one of Ezeli’s first guests.  “I love his zest for life,” Kerr said of Ezeli. “His desire to play, his engagement in trying to make that happen. I love all of that, and I sure hope it happens for him.”  At least five days a week, Ezeli arrives at a gym near his Los Angeles-area home by 6:30 a.m. After 90 minutes of basketball, he does yoga, Pilates, weightlifting and rehab exercises intended to strengthen his left leg.  His body fat is below where it was when he was in the NBA. In pickup games, Ezeli flashes the same hustle and explosiveness that made him a key part of the Warriors’ rotation.  Overseas clubs recently inquired about signing Ezeli, but for now, he’s focused on the G League, from which 35 players were called up to the NBA last season.  “My goal is to play in the NBA again,” Ezeli said. “Whatever I’ve got to do to get there, I’m willing to do. I don’t like to regret things, so I’m just going to leave it all on the table and see what happens.”"
"According to 538s model, Kevin Durant is projected to be a borderline all-star. Lmao.  I am honestly really disappointed in 538 here. They do great election work, but this model is really lazy and doesn't take into account a lot of common sense stuff."
"Watching Kevin Durant in the Olympics was the first time I've ever rooted for him and I'd say in those games I came to like him a little bit. The US is such a dominant basketball country that we don't root for players just from sharing a nationality, but when we need a bucket against France, I sure do like KD haha."
People call Kevin Durant all sorts of worse things to him than bitch. Don't think it matters to him.

"Gonna be interesting to watch Blake Griffin, LMA, Kevin Durant guard Lebron, AD and Dwight"
Would Kevin Durant become Ekans if he joins the Denver Nuggets? 🤣🤣
Second teams would probably be:  PG: Oscar Robertson  SG: Jerry West  SF: Julius Erving  PF: Charles Barkley  C: Wilt/Russell(whichever one you didn't pick)/Hakeem  vs.  PG: Steve Nash  SG: DWade(or Harden if you want better spacing)  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Dirk Nowitzki(in a few years will probably be Giannis)  C: uh..... Dwight Howard?
James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  Blake Griffin  LaMarcus Aldridge  Patty Mills  Joe Harris  Paul Millsap  vs  one balding boii   lmfao the audacity

[MPJ next GOAT confirmed](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781918-michael-porter-jr-says-his-game-is-giannis-antetokounmpo-kevin-durant-mix)
"Public relations 101 is to not dignify those types of reports with a response. If every organization/player responded to every negative report, you would have Kevin Durant minus the Burners."
"Yeah last year was such a mess that I think they kind of get a pass, and they were still just a Kevin Durant toenail away from moving on. If it's not Nets/Lakers in the final, that shit is embarrassing for all of them, and I really hope it plays out like that tbh."
"It certainly counts as an extraordinary feat for LeBron. Can't really discount it.   But it also shades the team in question, that being the 73-win team. That team wasn't nearly as dominant in the playoffs as they were in the regular season, they lost 9 games in the weeks of the playoffs whereas they only lost 9 throughout the entire season.  Quite honestly it was pretty obvious Cleveland coasted those years. I believe those Cavs could've won over 62 games the years LeBron returned (Aside from 2018) had they played to their potential. I recall Kevin Durant saying OKC was more worried about beating Cleveland in 2016 than Golden State since they viewed Cleveland as being the most talented team in the league (Although the Warriors won 73 and had the UMVP/DPOY). Could've just been KD talking nonsense but regardless it goes to show the teams were far more evenly matched than the narrative would have you believe (Kyrie also outplayed Curry in the Finals, which is almost never brought up)"
"He wouldt score 40 a night if Jordan didn’t manange that. Simple as that, Kevin Durant would be killed"
Kobe literally admitted he retired with no idea on how to guard Kevin Durant and that he had no weaknesses on offense   https://youtu.be/WLmccH35j8Y  Starts at the 2:04 mark he said KD was the hardest guard he’s ever had in his life and retired not knowing how to slow him down.
Durant isn't known to have big hands.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2218531-kevin-durant-says-he-cant-palm-a-basketball
LMFAO Kevin Durant got injured and then what happened? Harden got beat by Curry. LMFAOOOO
I thought you were talking about Kevin Durant lmao
It would be fucking terrible.   &gt; Kevin Durant vs Kawhi sponsored by Chevy  Americans... would that fight have a halftime show?
"And he's better than Kevin Durant , and everyone else in the league not named Bron"
Kevin Durant is 2-1 against LeBron in the finals
Kevin Durant is actually the hardest to guard   Don't know what Iguodala is talking about
Kobe did too.   https://www.sportscasting.com/kobe-bryant-kevin-durant-toughest-defender-same-guard/
This kinda explains it https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/7/18/20699090/kendrick-perkins-espn-fox-kevin-durant-free-agency-tv-talking-head  Dude was beloved by his teammates when he played too
Chuck with the W. Lebron made this culture of players being soft af and leaving their situations just cause they ain't good for a few years. He's probably the softest top 15 player oat and that includes Kevin Durant.
"lol KD ""asked"" to come to the Warriors? Draymond called the man from his car after game 7. Half the team flew to the Hamptons to convince him to sign with them.  KD didn't just show up one day and decide he wanted to play for the Warriors, they were recruiting the shit out of him all year: https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/report-warriors-players-recruited-kevin-durant-all-season.   It was still a very weak, disappointing decision by him, but man it's crazy how the narratives get out of control on here."
"if kevin durant played in the 90s, where its 1 on 1 basketball, he would score 40 a night. see how that works?  illegal defense made scoring more difficult. people forget that because the talent level has risen so tremendously."
"yeah, any edwards and kevin durant are basically the same 🙄"
"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
Just pick two modern teammates. James harden and kevin durant have 0 degrees of seperation since they played together on the 2021 nets.

"Yea just your typical 2nd year player  &gt;Among players who averaged at least 19 ppg, Porter finished with the 2nd-highest 3-point shooting % (44.5) in the NBA to Kevin Durant (45%).Under the same parameters, his 54% overall FG percentage was 4th behind Zion, Giannis and Jokic.  &amp;#x200B;  Man what are you on"
Kevin Durant the obvious choice!
"I would just turn on the TV and see which teams you like to watch. After that I believe there’s a database somewhere not sure of the link but you can look up some players.  Here’s a couple I would HIGHLY recommend watching because they are all stars and all time greats at the moment 1) LeBron James and the Lakers 2) Steph Curry and the Warriors(they will make a comeback next year) 3) Kevin Durant + Kyrie on the Nets 4) Giannis Antetokoumpo and the Bucks(he’s just fun to watch dunking too lol) 5) Some extra all stars - Westbrook, Beal, Jokic, Embid, Simmons, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell  Anyhow those are some all stars the first 3 points are hall of fame level (except Kyrie), then you can learn about each player on your favorite team.  Hope that helped"
"Certainly there's Asian bias, I'll even provide you with some examples:  * [1st team all state (California) alongside Ryan Anderson, James Harden and Chase Budinger; co-MVP with Kevin Durant of McDonald's All American game](https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team). Despite these accolades, he doesn't get any scholarship offers to notable colleges, aside from a walk-on at Stanford and a full ride with Harvard. * Slam Online article ""Life in the Fast Lane"" shared Lin's Draft Combine scores (or BAM):AVERAGE SPEED Jeremy Lin: 16.66 mph Derrick Rose: 16.60 mph John Wall: 16.48 mph Kyrie Irving: 15.67 mph Lin wins this battle.START SPEED Lin: 13.93 mph Wall: 13.25 mph Irving: 12.64 mph For Rose, BAM has only average speed data.

While we can argue that he's not in the NBA currently due to age or injuries, I wonder if perhaps things would be different had he gone to an actual top 16 college; or been drafted where the scouting metrics had him; or been acknowledged for his physical attributes.  Your 50 downvotes are certainly due to fans of Lin who are biased in their opinion, but the greater bias lies elsewhere."
Kevin Durant and Devin Durrant only separated by 3 degrees
It says six degrees of separation for Kevin Durant but it’s 7 degrees from Chet Carlisle..
Derrick Rose didn't have Kevin Durant on his team.
Kevin Durant&gt;James Harden&gt;Russell Westbrook

There’s a reason they joined our team and not yours lmao. For all the talk of your brand you guys haven’t been able to pull any top tier free agents in the last 20 years while we literally pulled Kevin Durant
He's Kevin Durant one of the best to ever play who gives a fuck and the nets not selling out makes sense theiy have only been in ny for maybe a decade they hold no weight in ny even being a superteam.
"Ok I can only take so much doc rivers slander in this thread. Dude has his problems, and he fucked up MASSIVELY three times through his career, but he is NOTA a bad coach and deserves a bit more respect in spite of his fuck ups.   dude won a ring.  Coached us through and out of the Sterling saga, which is one of those things you can’t properly rate. Took a healthy 2019 warriors to 6 with a team with no stars, a team that traded away their best player midway through the season, and, unlike the Toronto Raptors, actually won games Kevin Durant played in.   And after people cried for the 76ers to trade either Ben or Embiid every off season because “they could never fit together,”  guess what? They now do, in fact, fit together and work really well together, actually. And hey, remember how Tobias Harris wasnt good? Guess fucking what! He’s good again! Maybe even really good coaches can also be major fuck ups at times and none of us actually know the complexities of coaching in the nba and what makes one “good” or “bad” at doing it and we just think the fuck ups are more important because there are memes about it.   All that said, lol, the answer is obviously spo."
"&gt;Certainly advanced stats have never been kind to Kobe,   There's a lot more to advanced stats than a bunch of box-score composites. prime/peak Kobe was significantly better than what his box-score advanced stats show, and his +/- numbers seem to agree with that. He didn't lead the league in a single advanced stat over his prime, and yet had the best offensive +/- numbers in the ten year study (02-11) and his minute-adjusted +/- look better than anybody on the list outside of LeBron and Duncan. He was higher than Wade, Nash, CP3, Dirk, Duncan, etc.   https://sites.google.com/site/rapmstats/10-year-rapm   Offensive +/-: Kobe: +6.6   LBJ: +6.6   Wade: +6.2   Nash: 5.5   Paul: 5.2   Essentially/virtually tied for #3 overall and the guy ahead by .1 (Wade) isn't even remotely close in terms of minutes played (Kobe played 29783 min over this sample. Wade? 20540. A difference of nearly ten thousand!).   So he's #3 overall, and only KG and LeBron are ahead. He's ahead of Duncan, Dirk, CP3, Nash, etc.   He's #1 in ORAPM (tied with LBJ...except Bryant played more than 4200+ more minutes over this sample)   Again, here he's ahead of Dirk, Nash, Wade, CP3, Duncan, etc.   He has the third best two year Offensive APM (behind only Nash and LeBron, and he's .1 behind LBJ) Kobe: +6.0 http://www.backpicks.com   That 2002-2011 study does basically cover Bryant's prime and that's why it's the one to use BUT it doesn't even include his remarkable 2001 season.   Here's the RAPM from that season (playoffs and reg season included) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/11181n4avq5wefk/AABLySVPmcZXb0uiGPEk53fpa/2001.txt?dl=0   He's #2 among all stars/superstars behind only Duncan. He's #2 in minute-adjusted RAPM overall/among all players(williams (lol) played 1800+ less min and wasn't in Bryant's universe anyway, and Stockton played nearly 1000 less min)...he's ahead of freaking peak Shaq   Duncan: 5.52   Bryant: 4.39   Shaq: 4.37   His 2001 run WOWY score is among the very highest recorded. It ranks #13 on the list (out of 1591 recorded player seasons) at 5.9, and is ahead of any single season from Duncan, Bill Ruseell, KG, Jerry west, Oscar, Shaq, Hakeem, Drexler, Ewing, Bird, etc. That Lakers teams had a 14.2 SRS with Kobe IN, a SRS change of 10.8! from the games he missed.   Now let's look at what is widely regarded as his peak (2008)   In 08 Bryant was very widely regarded as the best player in the game despite the measly 24 PER and ""advanced stats"" that pale in comparison to LBJ/CP3, and yet he put up better offensive +/- than anybody in game outside of Nash (who played a ton less minutes) and in fact had the best minute-adjusted numbers in the entire league along with KG.   Nash: +7.26   Kobe: +6.29 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Kobe (24 PER): +6.29   LBJ (30 PER): +5.07   CP3 (30 PER): +3.41 https://www.dropbox.com/sh/teutg7zvxudqnlw/AACIF1UxAphVjODbTtO57\_mia/2008.txt?dl=0   Offensive and Defensive Adjusted Plus/Minus : 2007-08 Bryant was#2 in Off Adj +/- Rating   Bryant #1 in Adj +/- Rating https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxs2bv40jBt6GD7txEUcnItyvax\_zUfbTbnx1YXsL4/pub http://www.countthebasket.com/blog/2008/06/03/offensive-and-defensive-adjusted-plus-minus/   SWAgR Wins (minute-adjusted RAPM, first available in 2008): #1 in 2008 http://www.gotbuckets.com/   Over on the PC Board a poster completed a study that measured how well a team did when their star missed games.   It's called WOWY (with and without you)   In other words, if you looked at all of the activity of players moving in and out lineups over the years, whose team changed the most based on a given player’s presence?   Kobe (prime) had one of the highest scores recorded at +6.5.   He's higher than Russell, Wilt, Chamverlain, Duncan, Shaq, Bird, KG, Dr J, Karl Malone, Barkley, Durant, and many other great players.   His prime WOWYR is among the highest ever recroded at +6.5, and he's at +4.9 for carreer. To put that into perspective, Shaq is at 6.7 for career, and 5.2 for career.   The answer? Regression, the same statistical method used on play-by-play data in the last few years to create irreplaceable impact metrics like RAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus). Since comprehensive play-by-play does not exist before the late ’90’s, WOWYR instead regresses WOWY data, or game-by-game plus-minus data.

And what's particularly impressive about Bryant is that he made astronomical impact on great teams and next to some other stars. It's easy for a superstar to take a horrible team and get them to mediocrity, or turning a decent team into a good one, but making HUGE impact on amazing teams/ strong contenders is much more impressive, and so the fact that this his impact is at this level while playing with Shaq from 02-04 (on teams that weren't built/around him and while playing with another superstar whose biggest strength was also scoring, so certainly not the ideal situation to make maximum impact) and then anchoring the contending teams of 2008-2011 (the 08 were one of the strongest non-champion in history and GOAT level with Pau, and the 09 Lakers were one of the best teams in history and statistically one of the strongest champions ever, and obviously the 2010 Lakers were the champs) is extremely impressive   2000-2003 RAPM:   Tim Duncan: 6.653076648712158   Kevin Garnett: 5.877338886260986   Dirk Nowitzki: 5.492855072021484   Kobe Bryant: 5.319833278656006   Ray Allen: 4.893278121948242   Shaquille O'Neal: 4.781240940093994   Vlade Divac: 4.614269256591797   Eddie Jones: 4.310861587524414   David Robinson: 4.280535697937012   John Stockton: 4.192468166351318   Top-10 from 2000-2007 using this data (no priors other than the ridge penalty):   0 (Tim Duncan). 6.500221252441406   1 (Kevin Garnett). 5.95599889755249   2 (Dirk Nowitzki). 5.492483615875244   3 (Kobe Bryant). 5.328146934509277   4 (Manu Ginobili). 5.262575149536133   5 (Paul Pierce). 4.795802116394043   6 (Rasheed Wallace). 4.647972106933594 7 (Ray Allen). 4.319425582885742   8 (Shaquille O'Neal). 4.274540424346924   9 (Andrei Kirilenko). 4.141995906829834   Here's 2006-2010:   0 (LeBron James). 6.657414436340332   1 (Kobe Bryant). 6.563058853149414   2 (Vince Carter). 6.485203742980957   3 (Manu Ginobili). 6.1238603591918945   4 (Dwight Howard). 5.78971529006958   5 (Tim Duncan). 5.780171871185303   6 (Kevin Garnett). 5.3996477127075195   7 (Dwyane Wade). 5.073834419250488   8 (Steve Nash). 4.619450569152832   9 (Baron Davis). 4.204566478729248   2004-2009 APM:   Tim Duncan: 7.90   LeBron James: 7.27   Kobe Bryant: 6.95   Glenn Robinson: 6.84   Kevin Garnett: 6.68"

"It’s because he has a history of doing so.   Who else has scheduled a special with espn to announce their move following free agency? Anyone other than him? I haven’t seen one but admit I could be wrong if I missed someone else doing so.  The decision is one clear example of an all time media blunder but also shows how intentional he is in controlling stories and how typically it’s done in a narcissistic manner.  His comments related to China are another example and have aged particularly poorly.   It’s like Kevin Durant with his burner social media accounts-love them both as players but they are not going to get the benefit of doubt while they show patterns of behaviors.  They also don’t need our approval in how they act with the media.  It simply explains why people assume he is crafting a narrative with his Steph comments, because he shows patterns along those lines."

"It’s like the Durant shit. I absolutely loathed Durant for bitching out and signing with a 73 win team that knocked him out after his team had a 3-1 lead in the playoffs. On the flip side I can’t hate the Warriors for signing him. Literally every Basketball team should’ve been trying to sign him, including overseas leagues trying to throw obscene money at him.

"Cuban tried to do this with Westbrook in 2016. In the first round of the playoffs, OKC was up 3-1 and Cuban said to the media that Westbrook was ""not a superstar"" -- I think in an attempt to get Westbrook to try and prove him wrong and potentially shoot OKC out of the next game.   Westbrook dropped 36/12/9 and OKC closed them out in game 5. Kevin Durant then called Mark Cuban an idiot."

javie? and you think the motherfucker isnt biased? didnt he defend the kevin durant obvious step out of bounds a couple years ago when he was still with the warriors? thats your analyst?
Yes but did you know Kevin Durant is the all time leader in free throws drawn in the 3rd when his mom is in Pittsburgh and the concessions stand is selling hot dogs
kevin durant really joined forces with this mf and thought ppl would love him lmao
"They weren't the same draft class though.  The choice is Harden or Steph.  The other choice was Russ or Love.  Both are tough decisions even in hindsight, and I doubt anyone would call Kevin a better player than Russ anymore (prior to his move to Cleveland he definitely had a case, though); but the synergy of Steph, Durant and Love would have been insane."
"Yeah he's a superstar, no he isn't a better scorer than Harden and KEVIN DURANT."
"[""Kevon Looney drawing Kevin Durant comparisons"" - Feb 2013](https://youtu.be/7ZuJ9I8oZAo)"
All I know is fuck Kevin Durant.
"Without mentioning his 50+ and his 60 point games, which are amazing but are outliers. How is he a better scorer than Harden and KD? When each guy has had like 7-8 years with higher ppg than Tatum has ever had. Kevin Durant is consistently like a 52/40/89 guy as well. Tatum has potential to be one of the best scorers in the game, but don't go making him out to be a better scorer than Kevin fucking Durant right now you make yourself look like a fool."
"This was the parking deck every single game at the Q in 2017 for KD.  Even the viewing parties for games in Oakland. People blaring the Lil B ""Fuck Kevin Durant"" song in unison from like 100 cars.   Nets in 4 though  Boston won't win anything, maybe one QUARTER."
"After the game Kenny said Tatum wants to be Kevin Durant.. next series Tatum is either going to prove himself as a superstar in this league, or he’s gonna get humbled"
"Yes and Russell has never even done that with players like James Harden, Kevin Durant and Paul George. Tony Parker actually won meaningful basketball games. Russell Westbrook is all stats he doesn’t help you win at all."
hopefully tatum can just duel kevin durant and I'll treat that as the actual series in my head. Everything else is just such a power difference hard to get excited.
its so nice to see kevin durant participating in reddit discourse
"I don’t hate the human being Kevin Durant, but I hate the move."

"Yeah I mean I was disappointed, but Kyrie has chosen where had gets to play exactly once in his career. He chose to play with kevin durant in his hometown team. I'd probably pick that too. Despite everything, the man had some great games in green.  Honestly were it not for his horrendous bucks series the worst part about kyrie would be the media's thirst for narratives. Every single interview quote is torn apart and printed in the worst possible light. That's what you can expect when a superstar leaves a superteam, but still it was annoying af."
"I don't necessarily hate him either, but I don't understand why any Celtics fans would root for Brooklyn this year.  Kyrie is whatever, but I can't root for a NY team lead by him and Kevin fucking Durant. Also never enjoyed Harden's foul-ball so the entire team is really easy to root against."
Kevin Durant in that game closing was equally bad if not worse.  That’s a game they win and go into the finals if Klay doesn’t go crazy
Kevin durant was up 3-1 in the wcf to 73 win warriors WITH Russel westbrook on his team who was balling. They both choked it away after that but dont act like it was only westbrook
Dude literally has zero playoff series wins as the best player on his team  Zero  No one really wants to build a team around the guy lmao he doesnt contribute to winning basketball unless he's the sidekick to kevin durant
I don’t want to see Kevin Durant sweep Russ in 4 thank you very much.
"He's 24th all time in points scored. He's 12th all time in TS%. There  are zero players who have more points and a higher TS%. Maybe Kevin Durant in a couple years.  ""not great""  You are out of your mind if you have a hall of fame without Reggie Miller."
I think it'll just be an Unholy Trinity of blame unless one of the guys just plays historically bad like if Kevin Durant goes 2011 finals LeBron on us yeah he's going to get shat on all summer
I’m Kevin Durant.  You know who I am.
"That would be the most amazing ""re-tooling"" in NBA history. Trade away Kevin Durant for essentially a #1 pick, a #2 and a #4. Admittedly, they did have to use their own picks for the top 2 picks, but trading KD opened up that door."
"I'll always dispute this when people say the Lakers were trying to be bad. At the end of each season when it was clear they weren't gonna make the playoffs, sure, *then* they were no longer trying to win games and were instead prioritizing looking at their young players. But the Lakers were bad because of a combination of sheer incompetence by Jim Buss (and maybe Mitch Kupchak, depending on how much input he had), and having an aging star in Kobe Bryant.   Post Achilles Kobe wasn't any good anymore, and kept getting hurt, but the Lakers were trying to be loyal to him so he was still one of the highest paid stars in the league, and he wasn't wanting to take a back seat, so no other stars wanted to go sign up to be his sidekick. On top of that, the Lakers had gone all in on the Dwight Howard. Steve Nash combo, and that backfired and really screwed the Lakers immediate future, when Nash had essentially a career-ending injury in his 2nd game with the Lakers and Dwight Howard left after one year.  So that was the backdrop for why the Lakers were doomed to be no more than simply mediocre. But what made them as bad as they were was this stupid insistence that every year they could land a star player just cause they were the Lakers. So every year they tried to pitch the stars to join them, and when they got turned down (LeBron, Melo, LaMarcus Aldridge, etc), they would refuse to sign any non-stars to long term contracts so they could keep their cap clear for the next summer. Rinse and repeat.   This finally came to a head when Kevin Durant wouldn't even give them a meeting in 2016 (when he met with like 5 other teams), and the Lakers panicked and blew all their cap space on Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, signing both to fully guaranteed 4 year contracts for huge money. Mitch and Jim were both fired a few months later, and Rob Pelinka then spent the next two years trying to dig the Lakers out of the hole they were in."
"Fun fact... Joe Harris is good friends and still hangs out with a lot of his college friends, who are mostly semi nerdy / semi douchy NYC finance people.     I love imagining Joe going from practicing and hanging out with Kevin Durant, Kyire, Harden straight to a bar with a bunch of people no different than any of my own friends and doing the same shit we did in the city"
What does that mean for Kevin Durant lol
"lol, sit down, this post is better than any of them ""Gems"" you've posted:  1. Ben Simmons for Kyrie Trade 2. Will Kevin Durant ever get his jersey retired ? 3. Having seen multiple “F\*\*\* The Celtics” memes on the Raptors sub and none on ours, here's a meme"

"A big part of this is the longevity the 2000s class has had thanks to modern medicine as well as their own hard work.  Chris Paul, Lebron James, and even Kevin Durant have all had 12+ year careers and more importantly are still in MVP talks all these years later. Normally these types of superstars in history would be relegated to role player roles or bench roles to the end of their careers.  For example Kevin Garnett Tim Duncan Dirk and Kobe had tough final years to their careers due to injury and age in similar years career wise Chris and Lebron are in now."
"""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am."""
"Look I get you guys are knicks fans and I know the feeling of going from a laughingstock to a legitimately good team, it's an awesome feeling. I'm not saying the knicks haven't had a great season or aren't a great story, I just have a different philosophy on what level improvement is impressive. Also you guys are downplaying how hard it is to go from a good team to elite, which isn't fair to the Jazz or their fans. Playing at a level near the Warriors or the MJ Bulls is absurd, especially if all you did is add a player like Mike Conley (who's no Kevin Durant).  I just think it's way harder to go from a good team to elite than what the knicks did. I still think Randle should be MIP and that Thibs has proven all of his doubters wrong (I was one of them)."
"&gt; And we did build our team, we didn’t need several free first rounders to do it either.  Just nets superfan Kyrie Irving to convince his best friend and free agent Kevin Durant to team up with him. And then for them to convince James Harden to shoot his way off his team to join them."
"Never forget that time Durant cruised to an open dunk because the defenders rushed to stop Curry shooting a fast-break three.  ""Yeah, Kevin Durant with an open lane to the basket is the less worrying threat here."""
"Haha yep, I routinely remind the Nets sub that this Nets team doesn't form unless Kyrie grew up a Nets superfan, and that his best friend is Kevin Durant, and that his other good friend/ex-teammate is James Harden.  That being said, Sean deserves some credit for amassing good support cast and making sure they were cap flexible two years ago.

"But that’s not him capping it he’s just not as good as Kevin Durant/Stephen Curry/Lebron James. Same shit with Lillard.

Julius Erving  17. Karl Malone  18. Moses Malone  19. Elgin Baylor  20. Kevin Garnett  I'll admit that was a little harder than i expected, but i'm sure there are tons i left out."
"No I didn’t want do discredit him for that, just saying that Kevin Durant is the more efficient player. LeBron is unstoppable, even more in the playoffs because he can get to the rim so easily and score at will"
*Kevin Durant awakes bolt upright from a nap and opens reddit*  There's work to do.
Your original comment said “he had Kevin Durant” and that’s it  https://imgur.com/a/ABFuZnP
He played with Kevin Durant. We can objectively measure a players value added to his team. Robert Horry won 6 titles I’d take a lot of players over him. You don’t just use raw wins of a team.
This comment complimenting Steph is how I know you definitely are not Kevin Durant
If he just cut out the unnecessary pull up 3s (his favourite player is Kevin durant lol so I don’t think it’s gonna stop) he would be really efficient. Hopefully he just gets better at them next season
"The Bucks should trade him for Kevin Durant in the off season.  That way the Nets can have Kyrie, Harden, Giannis."
"yeah, most top players tend to go with their first name or a nickname, except a few. For example:  Lebron James: we just call him lebron, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Giannis Antetokounmpo: we call him giannis, and the same applies for him  Kevin Durant: we call him mainly KD, followed by durant or kevin durant, but mostly KD  Steph curry: we call him steph, and we also call him curry, but I feel like I personally use steph for, around others who know ball  James Harden: Usually just harden or james harden  Anthony Davis: I think most people in real life and online mostly refer to him as AD, and ocasionally by his full name  Kawhi leonard: literally Kawhi, never heard him called by his last name alone unless its by a commentator   Luka Doncic: Luka, Doncic, and Luka Doncic are all common, but I use Luka the most  Kyrie Irving: simply kyrie  Carmelo anthony: I think I've only referred to him as melo  Paul George: PG, PG13, or Paul George, never Paul or George  This can go on and on, but a LOT of guys are referred to their first names, even the likes of Klay, Russ, Draymond, etc"
"RIP Kevin Durant - one of the legends of the game  Roasted to death on August 19th, 2021"
&gt; kyrie wanted to play with KD but the celtics werent willing to sign&amp;trade for him  The Celtics weren’t willing to do a sign and trade for Kevin Durant? I’m gonna need a source for that.
Kevin Durant “saving” the ball with his foot 3 feet out of bounds.
I'd argue the opposite. Lebron makes teammates better in a way Kevin Durant can never. And that's not insulting KD. But lebrons playmaking and leadership is on it's own level.
Except for that Kevin Durant hates you now
"Definitely the Nets. I get to hang out with my best friend Kevin Durant, and the Bucks can go to the finals again."

"In the playoffs, Durant shot 57% TS% in his OKC days, he shot 65% during his GSW days. It's pretty asinine to think Durant would put up those numbers regardless just because he's Kevin Durant. He's obviously a great scorer, and I'm not even arguing Luka's a better scorer (FWIW I have Durant and Curry above Luka pretty easily in terms of scoring) All I was saying is that your examples are flawed, especially when using TS%  Durant averaged less PPG on the same TS% as Luka did during his OKC days, I don't think my comment was that far off. Not once did I say Luka has an argument over them, but rather your initial argument was flawed."
"He scored 35 ppg on 70% TS largely cause he's Kevin Durant lol, his entire game is based on uber efficiency  What other player would be capable to score 176 points on 110 shots in a series?   Also, what MVP candidate did Curry play with against Portland?"
"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/11/golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-kevin-durant-argument-suspension-what-did-they-say-report        &gt;Green accused Durant of making the whole season about him even though he was going to leave after this season. Green let out his frustrations about how Durant has handled free agency — keeping his options open and keeping the story alive, consuming the Warriors and their season with talk of what Durant will do next.        this is what it was about, and no i dont believe its not about this because a few years later they said conflicting stories to each other where neither of them take any blame for it."
"Luka averaged 36 points on 57% TS in the Clippers series  Curry averaged 36.5 points on 66%TS in the WCF against Portland   Kevin Durant averaged 35 points on 70% TS against the Cavs in the finals  Luka’s elite, but he’s never been as efficient as Curry/KD have so far (especially during the regular season)  That’s whats separating them rn"
"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32051548/lebron-james-reacts-amassing-zero-votes-nba-best-player-offseason-survey  “LeBron James took to Twitter to react to ESPN's offseason survey of 10 NBA scouts and executives leaving him without a single vote for the title of best player in the NBA. …  … In the survey, Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant evenly split the voting among those 10 scouts and executives for the title of best player in the league.”  I guess NBA execs and scouts are delusional trolls as well…"
"I think that article is about a different incident. There were [a bunch](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/14/18094918/kevin-durant-draymond-green-drama-fight) of different fights between them over the years.  The tl;dr is that by December of the 18-19 season KD still hadn't told anyone on the team what his plans for free agency was. I think most people on the team assumed that meant he was leaving or at least wasn't committed to the team long-term. He was also behaving pretty ridiculously at the time, like when he got super mad at Draymond for passing the pall to Steph instead of him during a game."
Source? Because based on [this article](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-draymond-green-explain-their-view-infamous-argument) that's not the case at all.
The people who still stigmatize marijuana in the US are also the people who don’t care what Kevin Durant has to say lmao
"Wilt's 1963-1964 season is one of the greatest single seasons in NBA history. As No other all-time great as had a weaker supporting cast around him in the NBA Finals than '64 Wilt.  The Warriors finished 3rd in SRS with a rookie Nate Thurmond and players like Wayne Hightower, Tom Meschery, and Guy Rodgers leading in shots. Wilt had a .325 WS/48 in the regular season (3rd all-time), and his .323 WS/48 playoff run is 4th all-time in the Shot Clock Era.  In the WDF, with his team playing poorly, Wilt put up 38.6 PPG on a +7.8 rTS%.  In the Finals, he finished with 29.2 PPG on a +2.4 rTS% against the greatest defense of all-time. Only one other player (Tom Meschery) shot above 35 FG% in that series.  This year Kevin Durant had a spectacular performance against the Bucks--he played heavy minutes while his team was injured and/or playing poorly. This was basically Wilt Chamberlain every postseason before '67, and Wilt was doing it against far superior competition than the '21 Milwaukee Bucks.  The mixture of scoring, passing, rebounding, and defence that Wilt provides is so impactful to a team and it's why i don't understand the narrative that his stats and impact were all empty."
idk Kevin Durant is constantly browsing social media to respond to shit and he gets paid more 🤷‍♀️
Kevin Durant partners with weedmaps to make money.
"So there exists only 1 super team? The Warriors? That’s laughable. It’s all semantics and subjective to biased opinions then. Again, look at what the league was doing, Celtics with KG, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce was the Super team of their time just not labeled. The Lakers and other teams did the same.   Lebron bailed on Cleveland why? Why didn’t he just push forward n win it then? Because he wanted to start Ring chasing with the best odds… look at the intentions and moves. Lebron, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love is a super team. Are we just arguing semantics and minor details here? To split hairs so we can dump 100% of the super teaming on Durant while forgetting all context of every other Franchise trying to super team? Or just excuse Lebron?   Lebron crushed the East for how long with Super teams? Take out Lebron of his teams huh? So why not just take Curry out of the Warriors, Kd with Klay and Dray isn’t a Super team either just an extremely great team led by Durant in that case  I applauded Lebron for leaving Cle the first time, he was smart enough to know he can’t carry alone. The league is trending towards stacked super stars and super teams at the time. He was a genius to orchestrate his OWN super teams on HIS terms. And then he can bail on the franchise (Cle, Mia, Cle) n let them sink of swim. The Warriors were a self made “super team” and Kd joined it. So he had it easier than Lebron having to put together a super team, so what? If I recall at least KD left the Warriors but let them work something out of it. Lebron just nopes the fuck out on the franchise with no help on the future I think."

Kevin Durant literally said he didn’t like how management handled it.   How are you blaming Draymond?
Jrue was literally the missing piece for Milwaukee to win a Title. Without his defense the US Olympic team was getting fucking wrecked. I just don't get why anyone could throw shade at this baller? He's a streaky shooter when he's on he's straight FIRE but when he's off his shooting is indeed dog shit. Bucks have many other shooters to take those shots when he's not on. Kevin Durant said Jrue is the best defender in the NBA and on top of all that Jrue is the perfect guy both ON nad OFF the court you want on your team! Put him on literally any other team in the NBA and they will instantly become a better team.

"Really? Better than Chris Paul, Westbrook and Kevin Durant?"
"I think the headlines are a bit wrong about this. I guess first it’s because Kevin Durant didn’t answer the question directly. That’s said, he said that left GS because he realized the culture sucked and that was obvious to him after that altercation with Green.   I don’t think he is blaming other people for the altercation but he is blaming other people / culture for the reasons he left ."
"&gt;  Every advanced metric? Let's compare Magic's first 12 seasons to Steph's.  You're comparing raw totals of stats for seasons Steph missed.  That's ridiculous, of course Magic is going to have higher totals, he played 906 games and Steph played 756.  150 extra games, of course Magic is beating him in total win shares, VORP, BPM etc.  Not only that, but Magic peaked earlier.  So even for the stats like ws/48 you're ignoring the fact that Magic retired before he could drop off production in his 30's.  Even in the stats you mentioned, Steph's best seasons are better than Magic's, and it's not close.  So sure, go ahead and count the seasons Steph was playing next to Monta Ellis with glass ankles.  But you don't then get to ignore that Steph's peak was head and shoulders above Magic's and that despite Steph's age, it's still going.  Not only that, but you're not adjusting for league average.  You want to see how well Magic performed relative to his league vs how Steph did vs his?  Here's some perspective:  Stats Magic led the league in:  Steals per game (2, but never actually led steals), FT%, assists (4), offensive win shares, ws/48, VORP  Stats Steph led the league in:  Scoring (2), Steals per game (total steals twice), FT% (4), PER,  TS% (2), offensive win shares, win shares, ws/48 (2), OBPM (2), BPM (2), VORP, 3 pt FG made (6), FG made  Again, my point is not whether Steph is better or not.  I never made that argument.  What I'm trying to get you to acknowledge is that it's a real debate, and there are good arguments that Steph is better.  His peak season, 2015-16 is better than any of Magic's career, for example.  He then dropped back in production because the Warriors got Kevin Durant, but he was every bit as good the next 3 seasons."

"I don't care if you're tired of people comparing it to a normal job -- it *is* a normal job to Kevin Durant. It's the only job he has, the only job he knows. His decision was based solely on what was best for him. You can put it on a pedestal all you want, but for him the things he mentioned that made it a no-brainer are the same types of things that would make it a no-brainer for anyone else in any role.  Better city with more things to do for a young person with money, higher chance of success in your job, more accolades and recognition, chance to work for a much better and more successful company that you already have friends at. Only a total idiot would pass that up.  As a Mav fan I'm super happy/proud of what Dirk did, but even as much weight as that ring carries, if he'd have teamed up with Kobe or Shaq when those chances were out there... he'd have won several more rings and would be considered better than people consider him now."
Why was Kevin Durant at his camp?
That was an all time blunder for Dumars. Thank god he won a ring a few years later. I've always said I never understood taking international guys that high unless they're a Luka type of player where they're so accomplished overseas that it makes sense. Carmelo literally was the best scorer I've seen in college until Kevin Durant came into Texas. That was a no brainer pick.

Kevin Durant

"Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Giannis, LeBron, Embiid, Jokic, Doncic, Curry, Dame, Kawhi. Who are you taking Gobert over even for the regular season? If you want to argue health that’s fair, but given they all play at least 70 games who are you taking him over?"
Kevin Durant just leaving a team with no regard for the city or fans? I refuse to believe it. He would never do that.
Fuck Kevin Durant and I’m so sick of him talking about this bitch made move he made. I’m glad this will forever follow his legacy.
"My question is why did he leave the thunder the way he did, after trade deadline when they tried to do everything they could to keep him, one of the great mysteries. He defends the shit out of himself about leaving a team that was a win away from the finals, (which he and others blew after being up 3-1) and then defends himself about leaving that team on a burner,(which is a pretty obvious response to critics before and after his first team, the league responds with the “Kevin Durant” clause). Everyone, at the end of the day, has a desire to be liked, but it is interesting he would create burner accounts to defend himself and so forth. He will never win a ship in jersey. If he does, then he is justified, but okc was his team, and they lost. Win in the playoffs or/and shut up. Nobody cares anymore and his legacy will be that of the biggest bitch in nba history. You will have to educate me if there it’s a bigger bitch. Of course he eventually ran afoul of the warriors, a winning organization that built from ground up and their culture. Live life man"
I always felt that the 73 win warriors were only one Kevin Durant shaped piece away from winning a chip
"&gt;""Kevin Durant is pretty much like, this is gonna sound weird, mentally penetrating you.""  The entire r/nba subreddit came in their trousers after reading this"
"Kevin Durant was easily better than Kawhi. If he doesn't get injured, he runs away with FMVP for the 3rd year in a row"
"Now I get why the Oklahoma City Thunders organization and fanbase calls Kevin Durant a ""cupcake""."
"&gt; nobody says any player should consider a fans opinion lol, but they're allowed to say it's the weakest move ever done by a player in history of sports.  Yes, you're allowed to say whatever you want.  But moving the argument from the unfalsifiable 'weakest move' framing to the factual 'Kevin Durant moved to a better team, in a more desirable city, in a place where he could make far more money' properly shows how ridiculous it is.  &gt; and nah don't rewrite history, OKC has always been a well ran franchise and the team durant left was stacked. He had more than many superstars in history could dream of, and they were up 3-1.  I didn't say it was a bad roster.  But it's a franchise that hired a series of bad coaches, let top talent go because they were too cheap to sign them, and is located in one of the three worst media markets of any team in the US.  That he left is incredibly unsurprising to anyone with the slightest amount of perspective (which is still more than a huge number of people in this subreddit).  &gt; actual professionals like you understand KD more lol, can you sound any more pretentious  Yeah I stand by this one.  You have to go through some incredible mental contortions to make a coherent argument for why KD was obligated to not go to the Warriors, and anyone who has picked between multiple desirable employment opportunities, or jumped ship to a company at the top of their field, knows how bullshit this is."

"Did YOU? Kevin Durant left him for a reason even though they had a godly 2016 team. He knew you can’t win with Westbrook as your #2, especially not as your #1.   There are better scorers, passers, playmakers in every single year of his career. He was never so good at any one of those things to justify being labelled as good as he was, if he’s your #1 or #2 you’re not winning a championship and as a #1 his team is a perennial 6-8 seed with a first round exit.  He had all the counting stats yet the impact doesn’t match. Super overhyped because people think 30/10/10 = God yet he’s actively hurting his team when aiming for those stats.   Good player but overrated."
i’m sorry what KD? didn’t you cry to your agent saying [He RUINED your LIFE](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)
Does Kevin Durant know what a decade is
Speak for yourself. I enjoy watching competition. Warriors absolutely dominated anybody team that wasn’t Houston during that run and they were already an all time great team even without Kevin Durant    With KD it really did ruin the quality of the league. I don’t even like hockey very much and I still watched way more hockey especially in the last 2 rounds than ever before when KD joined the team he couldn’t beat

"You’ve got this one backwards. There is no need to speculate regarding this particular point. Marcus Thompson wrote an article following Durant’s exit about how Durant wanted friendship with Curry and company, but never felt accepted. Durant has said as much [himself](https://www.google.com/amp/s/larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kevin-durant-felt-like-outsider-with-warriors/502649%3Famp).   This point would be more sensible if Durant was always distant from the rest of the team, but that’s not the case. Part of the story of him going to the Warriors in the first place is some of these guys playing together for team USA and a friendship growing from that.    What I don’t buy is that someone forced his hand. Rather, I think he was leaving, Draymond knew it and reacted emotionally in a heated moment as he tends to do."

"i'm of two minds about kevin durant and his prolific twitter use. one one hand it's his life and his twitter account. he can do whatever the fuck he wants as long as he's not hurting anyone or himself. on the other hand, sometimes it's best to ignore the haters and trolls and rise above the bullshit. one of the best ways to rise above it all is to not have a social media account or to not respond"
LIGHTYEARS everyone   Also. Man up. Curry should have said something. Klay should have said something. KEVIN DURANT should have said something to the team. Draymond absolutely should have said something.  When Bob Myers clowned KD at the parade… it was painfully obvious that nobody respected his decision to play there.   This is why nobody said anything.   And why his rings won’t carry the respect he thinks they deserve.

No one going to mention how Kevin Durant thinks he joined the Warriors a decade ago?
"For me its Trump(GOAT), 50 Cent and Kevin Durant. 50 Cent has some of the greatest tweets ever."
"Ah yeah I'm dumb because I disagree with Kevin Durant, I think you two are dumber you know why : we can disagree without trying to be insulting, but hey internet warriors and all"
"Steph was the Sky Fucker.  KD has been blessed with a Fucker title too now.  Kevin ""Mindfucker"" Durant, Lord of Ahegaos"
Jordan’s *lowest* FTA in Chicago was 6.9   Kevin Durant hasn’t gotten to 6.9 FTA since 2014  Harden does get more FTA than Jordan  LeBron’s case is weird because it varies so much.
"Oh, no, The best player in the world - Kevin Durant mentally penetrated the Jrud Holiday and the whole Bucks squad, what does this mean to Lebron's legacy? Now on undisputed."
...Kevin Durant is about as OCD to the game of basketball as it possibly comes.
"Giannis is better than Kevin Durant as of August 18, 2021."
"It’s not all that different IMO, the end result is the team was stacked. Miami/Golden State were just the teams they decided on that had the space. If Kawhi, Lebron, Jokic, and Zion all decide to take less and go to Detroit, it doesn’t matter that they had the worst record last year. Kevin Durant just got the recipe from Lebron and took it a step further."
Put Kevin Durant on the Bucks. Because I'm a Bucks fan. It also takes him out of Brooklyn. Also because no one is beating a KD-Giannis pairing
Ya if Kevin Durant didn’t have his length and height his moves are basic. Of course in sports all where it depends on height a 7ft guy will “penetrate” you mentally. Bball is fun to watch but is a funny game.

"""mentally penetrating"" is one hell of a way to put it. that being said, i do understand what he's saying. kevin durant is handful to play against"
&gt; It’s almost a decade later since I made that decision   Kevin Durant thinks a decade is about 5 years
"I've only kind of kept up with this. But do we know the actual full argument?   Like was KD mad that Draymond didn't just submit to him on the court. Or was he more mad Draymond called out the truth in that he already had one foot out the door?   I guess I'm reading the situation as there was a lot of under cover tension that indicated Kevin was leaving before that argument. Dray was bold enough after his fuckup to call Kevin out on it.   I guess this story has been told so many ways in so many places I don't know what all is for sure.   If people really did think Kevin was acting with a foot out the door then Dray was right. It came out at the wrong time but if someone can pickup that you're on your way out its hard to believe that isn't hurting on court chemistry.   Is Durant mad he got called out for his bullshit and he wasn't placated? Or did he legit not know at all he was leaving and Draymond was projecting and attacking a teammate?   If I'm Kerr and I feel the same way yeah it isn't the best move to retain talent but I'm not going go to bat for KD and shit when I feel the same way. If Draymond picked up on it maybe everyone else did too and that's why no one stepped up to talk about it. They were all over KD's being ready to leave.   Makes sense Bob Myers to do what he did as well maybe he's not around KD like Kerr and the players and has no sense that KD was on his way out. So he's still thinking like a GM as he should that an apology would fix things.   Draymond would also be right to reject being told to smooth it over because he feels like he's right in assessing KD being ready to leave.   Overall some of these ""revelations"" just cause more confusion. Short of KD saying yeah I hated playing within a system by year 3 and already decided to leave people are going to make up their own version of events."
"Maybe he set records in his conference, he didn't set actual records. Just off the top of my head Trae Young and Kevin Durant both had higher scoring averages as freshmen."

"I think Kevin Durant is one of the best of All Time.  I love Draymond both on and off the court.  I disagree deeply with everything they just said.  They sound very immature and coddled and out of touch.  They argued ON WORKTIME AT THE WORKPLACE.  The org did the best they could to try to fix it.

Pau Gasol BARELY fits into this list.  Reddit is way too biased on Tim Duncan for what i think are reasons external to the game of basketball.  And I'm fine with that, but you're absolutely wrong if you think Tim Duncan would survive on any other team not Spurs.  Spurs and Duncan is the GOAT match when it came to player + organization. No other organization + player combo will top those two. Curry + GSW comes at #2."

Chris Paul &gt; Kevin Durant He is only behind LeBron and Steph in on court impact in the last decade.
"No, because DAJ was never capable of scoring more than the low teens in points per game.  When you increase volume you decrease efficiency for everyone not named Stephen Curry.  Stephen Curry has two scoring titles on all time efficiency, 63% and 60.4% true shooting while leading the league in scoring.  That's insane.  That Steph can score more points on fewer shots than any of these people is pretty wild, and putting him next to Kevin Durant who is also scoring more than any of these other people on better efficiency...that is the point I'm trying to make.  They literally combined this season for 59 points on 38.9 shots, and that's at 33 years old for both of them.  Anthony Davis and LeBron James best seasons combine for 59.5 points on 43.4 shots."
"Yeah, people acting like AD is the most injury prone star in the league are not being realistic. Look at AD compared to these other top 10 players with how many regular season games they've all missed over the last 5 seasons.  * **Kevin Durant** - 147 games missed, 33 years old  * **Kawhi Leonard** - 138 games missed, 30 years old  * **Joel Embiid** - 131 games missed, 27 years old  * **Steph Curry** - 115 games missed, 33 years old  * **Anthony Davis** - 85 games missed, 28 years old"

"Lol at calling it slander. Also, nice job completely ignoring the fact you were making excuses for an ACLU recognized hate group.   Kyrie has been tweeting a lot of language that’s used by the NOI including a lot of this black Israelite stuff and black superiority language that’s straight out of the NOI playbook. He’s also been dog whistling with the Jewish star on social media very recently. That’s the real tell. Just because he hasn’t liked a post from Louis Farrakhan like Kevin Durant did, doesn’t mean we as rational humans can’t put the pieces together.   You have to be blind or dumb to fail to recognize Kyrie is clearly being influenced by the hate group."
That’s fair too. I still think there is 100% an argument for shaq. Especially needs too. If you happen to have Larry bird or Kevin Durant already shaq looks more priming as a pair for example
"Imagine being a GM and having prime Kevin fucking Durant want to join your team, you can do it, and you don't. That would be the worst GM move ever."

Kevin Durant
"Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden. They all have shown ability to play defense but don’t sometimes because they are old and carry offensive weight."
"&gt; 51% ain’t mid rangers lmao, it’s a lot of drives and finishes at the rim. Furthermore, driving draws contact.  Yes, that's why analytic-focused playstyles emphasize shots at the rim and 3pt shots. If someone's only shooting 51% from 2, that means they're probably shooting much worse from midrange because layups and dunks really buttress 2p%, and they are also much better at drawing fouls.   So if you're shooting at the rim, keep doing that. Otherwise, 3&gt;2 unless you're Kevin Durant."
kevin durant probably. he scores a lot of points but it feels like he could be scoring a lot more. nobody can guard him but he spends a lot of games just chilling
"My current favorite NBA player Kevin Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  Which is crazy because I still think he's the best player in the NBA, but I also think he has a couple of shortcomings."
"&gt;""I heard the Warriors pressured me into getting back. Nobody never said a word to me during rehab as I was coming back. It was only me and [director of sports medicine and performance] Rick [Celebrini] working out every day. Right when the series started, I targeted Game 5. Hell, nah. It just happened. It’s basketball. S--- happens. Nobody was responsible for it. It was just the game. We just need to move on from that s--- because I'm going to be back playing.""   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2848838-kevin-durant-explains-why-he-picked-nets-if-he-blames-warriors-for-injury-more.amp.html"
Kevin Durant as Desiree Allen
Imagine ONLY having Kevin Durant and James Harden as your best players. Maybe they can convince Sacramento to take one of them for Hield.
Harden is an alpha male Kevin Durant is a beta
BRANDON BOSTON JR IS THE NEXT KEVIN DURANT
"You listed a guy who isn't even a starter, a rookie who has never played an NBA minute and a guy who didn't play at all last season due to injury. I'm not sure why you're so upset about this.   Kevin Durant could have me play guard and our Texas team would absolutely embarrass the FSU team."
yeah god forbid JAMES HARDEN AND KEVIN DURANT don't have a third perennial allstar as a teammate poor them
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9. Joel Embiid   10. Luka Doncic   11. Jayson Tatum   12. Bradley Beal   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Kyrie Irving   15. Bam Adebayo   16. Zion Williamson   17. Paul George   18. Chris Paul   19. Devin Booker   20. Damian Lillard   21. Donovan Mitchell   22. Zach Lavine   23. Trae Young   24. Nikola Vucevic   25. Jaylen Brown   26. Domantas Sobonis   27. Klay Thompson   28. Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."
"Let's be real, you're picking 65 games as an arbitrary number because JoJo has two seasons where he played 63 games and 64 games respectively. Kevin Durant missed more than half of the season last year and he missed the entire season the year prior to that, but keep lying to yourself that he is the picture of health and durability in the NBA today."
"Kevin Durant hasn't played through a full season since 2013-2014, almost like he's injury prone or something 🤷‍♂️  You're right, this *is* fun!"
"CP3 has demonstrated so much more than Westbrook on the Rockets, Thunder, and the Suns. Zion is his 2nd year and hasn't had the privilege of playing with KEVIN DURANT.  Don't get it twisted I love Westbrook and don't think he's overrated you just provided two shitty arguments"
Be pedantic if you want but point is it was a very small amount  https://www.google.com/search?q=kevin+durant+foot+on+line&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=insxv&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvKc20D6RZy5760l4r93K9OcOLfOqw:1633630460541&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKoK3a87jzAhWrQjABHcZqD9wQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=645&amp;dpr=3.5#imgrc=h-drtiMup_hphM&amp;imgdii=Gdqh5HGGaa2hFM

"Ok and Kevin Durant was injured most of last season, missed the entire year before that, dealt with multiple multi-week injuries in golden state and missed almost his entire 2nd last season in OKC    By your logic Durant shouldn’t even be in the discussion as one of the best players in the league because he is injury prone and constantly not available       Lebrons 2020 season, playoffs and in 2021 before he got his injury he was playing top tier best player in the league type basketball. It wasn’t until after he came back with like 1 game left in the regular season and playoffs when he started to struggle"
Let me understand- he had a bad series shooting from three five years ago and he played with good teammates so he must not be good… what?  You know you’re talking bout Kevin Durant right? Kevin Durant.
Well no one is saying Kevin Durant is as great as lebron. Lebron wanted to be compared to Jordan so don’t be surprised when people have higher standards for lebron than they do for other guys
"Not just an elite offensive player, Boban has been the single best player per minute in the NBA. Boban is the per 36 god monster.  From 2015-2017 if you calculate the win shares/48 of all players that played at least 10 games the list goes like this.  &amp;#x200B;  |2015-2016|2016-2017| |:-|:-| |Boban Marjanović (.325)|Boban Marjanović (.280)| |Stephen Curry (.318)|Kevin Durant (.278)| |Kawhi Leondard (.277)|Kawhi Leonard (.264)| |Kevin Durant (.270)|Chris Paul (.264)| |Chris Paul (.253)|Rudy Gobert (.250)| |Russel Westbrook (.245)|James Harden (.245)| |Lebron James (.242)|Jimmy Butler (.236)|"
kevin durant.
DAE think Kevin Durant is good?
Kevin Durant gud imo
"What's the covid vaccine mandates like in LA. If they are not restrictive as Brooklyn maybe Kyrie should ask to get trade to LA maybe for Russell Westbrook.  Maybe we see how the trio of Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Kevin Durant do on the same team.   I don't think we've ever seen it happen before. I think people would be thunderstruck of it ever happens"
"I'm not making an argument, I'm just making fun of your favorite team. They don't relate, lol.   Not sure why me pointing out that Kevin Durant trashed Steph Curry after he left the team is bothering you so much, but I guess it does. A little sensitive about something that doesn't relate to you at all, aren't you?  Are you saying that because KD is a great basketball player that he's beyond any kind of criticism?  https://twitter.com/sleiman_jp/status/1384669928330907661?t=EbqyUA1ybCoXUtk31lcWPg&amp;s=19  KD has acted like a child both times he's left a team now. He can't help but talk shit about the people he bailed on. That's who he is. He ""can't win with those cats"" remember? Then he pulls the same shit after he leaves Golden State.   If you think anyone is going to pretend those things didn't happen just because the dude is good at basketball, then you're crazy lol.   Stop being silly. And again, maybe focus on your own team's drama. We're extremely happy over here with our new team.  But hey, keep defending a guy who already turned your franchise down since he can't win with ***you*** cats either."
Kevin Durant. Minimum top 5 player all-time
"I’ll just copy and paste and we’ll see if you can muster a response:  &gt; Setting aside your smugness, the reason harden had leverage to demand a trade is because of his player option after 21/22. Meaning he could walk for nothing in 2022. Kevin Durant has 5 years left on his contract with no options. Ben Simmons situation is showing us that he has no leverage assuming he wants to actually collect his 200+ million dollars over the next 5 years."
They have two MVP and scoring leaders in James Harden and Kevin Durant with LMA and Blake
"I get the 16 &amp; 6 season was his lowest, but the point still holds, Bosh made 5 straight all star games while averaging 18 ppg and 7 rpg including seasons with just 43 and 54 games played. A lot of his stats are inflated by playing on 20-30 win teams in Toronto where he was among the league leaders in USG% a number of seasons. He has one of the largest discrepancies in All Star Games and All NBA teams in league history.   If you look at Bosh's all star years and then compare them to Dirk who averaged 18 &amp; 7 with 37% 3PT shooting a year when Bosh made the ASG averaging 19 &amp; 7 with only 53 games played, Aldridge who averaged 22 &amp; 9 and missed the ASG, Hayward who averaged 20/5/4 for 2 straight seasons and missed both, Pau Gasol averaged 21/10/4, 19/8/3, 17/10/4 and 17/10/3 and missed the ASG each season. Theres a timeline where Pau is drafted by an East team and is an All Star every year from 2002-2016, instead he was stuck int he West and has 6 total all star selections (2 during his only 2 seasons in the East) and 4 All NBA selections.   All of the aforementioned guys and likelyl more, missed the ASG despite putting up stat lines comparable or just outright better than Bosh's.  I'm not saying he is worse than Love or Boozer or West, but even if he's had a better career and peak than those three, it doesn't mean he would've unanimously gotten All Star nods over them. Using Love as an example, he'd be pretty hard pressed to get an All Star selection in 2012 or 2014 over Kevin Love who was incredible those two years. That doesn't mean Love is better than Bosh all together.   Every year from 2005 to 2015 Bosh would be competing for 5 all star forward spots against the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Stoudemire, Marion, Webber, Brand, Boozer, David West, Mehmet Okur, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Andrei Kirilenko, Kevin Garnett (until 08), Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Blake Griffin, Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Anthony Davis, Josh Howard, Peja Stojakovic. Granted these guys didn't all or peak during that 10 year span, but at any given point 5+ of these players were in their prime and Bosh would've had to go up against them for one of just 5 all star spots. Unlikely he beats all of them for 10 straight years like he was able to do in the East where there was less competition.   If Bosh plays in the West he probably causes guys like Love or Boozer to miss a game or two, but at the same time, Bosh would miss out on ASG due to the plethora of talented forwards but at the same time."
"I don't think people hate KD, i think that narrative around him has expired where he was a snake who also wrote insecure posts on  the internet. now the narrative is, he is confident alpha, ""Bitch I'm Kevin Durant, You know who I am."" who also got hella clapbacks on the internet, and will put mofos on blast.  The narrative around KD since the nets playoffs and Olympics has been very positive."
"&gt; Tell me you haven't been paying attention to the NBA the last few years without saying you haven't been paying attention to the NBA the last few years.  Side note but this is the most annoying comment format I’ve seen on social media. Would you say this to someone in real life?   Setting aside your smugness, the reason harden had leverage to demand a trade is because of his player option after 21/22. Meaning he could walk for nothing in 2022. Kevin Durant has 5 years left on his contract with no options. Ben Simmons situation is showing us that he has no leverage assuming he wants to actually collect his 200+ million dollars over the next 5 years."
"Bosh is the most overrated player in the last 20 years. 1 All NBA selection but he was able to rack up All Star games in a super weak East where he was competing with old Kevin Garnett, Paul Millsap, Roy Hibbert and Rashard Lewis for all star spots. If he plays in the West he probably has 2-3 all star games, no way he's making the ASG averaging 16 &amp; 6 over Dirk, Duncan, Amar'e, Boozer, Pau, Blake, Love, West, Durant, Melo, Marion etc...  No way is Bosh better than Wilkins or a top 75 player imo."
"Which is crazy when there's so many potential things to go wrong.    Everyone talks about Kyrie, but there's so much more.  People have totally ignored that Kevin Durant only played half the season last year coming off the achilles - why does everyone suddenly assume he's gonna survive a full 82 games?  Or how about the fact that their entire frontcourt is relying on 3 guys who are way past their primes and could fall off cliffs at any moment?  Or that they still have shit depth?  Or will play no defense?   Yeah, if everything goes right for the Nets, they're leading contenders.  But things rarely do in a long NBA season, and they've got way more uncertainty than most good teams."
Kevin Durant Game 6 vs The Warriors   Said Fuck Yu to The Thunder nd Threw The Game🤦🏾‍♂️
Facts besides Dame embiid and giannis starting I want to have luka tatum zion booker and jokic on my bench. All their salaries should fit under the cap so we can also sign Kevin durant and LeBron James to be our water boys
"Kevin Durant must be fuming. The guy just wants to play basketball and win more titles, then this woke snowflake comes along and starts acting out like some 21 year old Instagram girl.  Too bad the players have so much power in today's NBA. Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, who's next to stir shit while having immunity from being punished?  Well, Ben is getting punished, but it really seems like a slap on the wrist in the grand scheme of things.   Way too often players talk about their rights when they should instead be talking about your responsibilities. How about your responsibilities to your team mates, Mr. ""Vaccine is a racist plot"""
Isn’t it 50% though? They aren’t going to confuse Steph with Kevin Durant.
"Well the money is max money, no matter where, and Kevin Durant is easily the best player on a team with that space, arguably the best player in the world (I feel like I should say again, arguably) and Brooklyn is a pretty cool place to be crazy rich so it's hard to imagine a better spot to ring chase."
Kevin Durant? Great basketball player. Never meddum.
You know there's gona be some graphic that comes on screen in the playoffs that'll be like:  NETS STARS TONIGHT  Kevin Durant - 43 points  James Harden - 35 points  Ben Simmons - 4 points

"Oh trust me, I became an nets fan in like 1998 and Jason Kidd turned me from a young kid who liked basketball to an obsessed die hard nets fan. Use to cut out his pictures in the news paper, along with Kmart and RJ, and hang them on my wall. When he announced he was resigning with the nets instead of the Spurs it was like one the happiest day of my childhood lol (looking back I wish he went to the Spurs, Duncan would have retired with  7 or 8 rings)  Vince was fun, and the whole Deron Williams to kg / Pierce era was… exciting? But nothing has ever come close to those early 2000 nets teams. The last 5 years has brought me back and it’s been an insane amount of fun. I used to get overly excited waiting patiently to see if we would sign Allen crabbed and Tyler Johnson or if their teams would match, and now we have Kevin fucking Durant on our team along with freaking James harden and Kyrie.   If we can just win 1 championship with this team I’d seriously be ok with another 5-10 years of complete mediocrity. If we win 2 or 3 championships then I could care less if the nets don’t make the playoffs for the next 20 years.   Can’t even imagine what it’s been like being a warriors fan over the past decade."
"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have.

"We treat people’s efficiency differently based on how well/how often they create their own shot and the volume at which they do it. That’s why Giannis, who scores 30 a game mostly unassisted, is looked at as a better scorer than Rudy Gobert, who scores half that and the only unassisted buckets he ever gets are putbacks. Absolutely nobody gives a shit where guys score their points when viewing them solely as scorers. Do you also think CP3 is a better scorer than Shaq?  Between “anybody can score that efficiently at that volume with a green light” and “Kevin Durant chooses to be less efficient” this is genuinely one of the most brain dead takes I’ve ever seen in this sub, and that’s a *high* bar."

Do you actually think the Bucks were going to run a defensive strategy that left *Kevin Durant* open?
Lebron  CP3  Any undersized 4/5 that only has big man skills  Knox. Dude has an unbelievable frame (pretty much a stronger Kevin Durant) but looks like baby Bambi in how uncoordinated he is.
It’s all worth it if you have Kevin Durant on your team.
Because Steph Curry is a better player than Kevin Durant.  People don't want to accept that though.
"Giannis 'padding stats in Garbage time' Antetokounmpo: 35 minutes on the court,  Kevin 'meaningful buckets only to try and regain the lead' Durant: 40 minutes on the court , spent more time on the court in the second half, took same amount of shots in the 4th.  You're obviously just basing your whole thing off a series you, like any human being, only remember the highs of.  Edit: Also, 34/11/4 on 67 TS% would be considered by most to be a better performance than 29/10/3 on 54 TS%."
"You are talking about two different things. Being the face of the NBA and being the best is not mutual. Kevin Durant and Giannis will not have to take that pressure on as long as Lebron is in the league. Once Lebron leaves, they will take the reign. That's just how it is."
Kevin Durant isn't even the best player on the nets.
Kevin Durant wanted to step in lol
Same age as…..Kevin Durant
What would the 2012 Thunder be in NFL terms? Put Watson on team that talented and we’ll see where they go from what I’ve seen Russ is too much of a winner without Kevin Durant beside him but ok. I’m convinced you’re trolling me rn.

&gt; Kevin Durant - Borderline All-Star  &gt; Kyrie Irving - Borderline All-Star  &gt; Klay Thompson - Scrub  Algorithms are sometimes bad.
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.      Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights. These players include Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, Jalen Green, Jalen Suggs.      None of these players would have incentive to sign extensions before 2025 as they can get substantially more by waiting for the new TV deal and higher salary cap.  I expect teams to maximize cap space in 2025 to increase their flexibility and target the number of free agents in this class, assuming players don't sign long term extension in anticipation of larger deals in 2025."
"If salary cap sees a big jump, it could lead to a situation similar to where Warriors were able to sign Kevin Durant when they normally wouldn't have been able to. Looking at players that would be entering free agency in their primes - Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, John Collins - would be the biggest beneficiaries.  Second beneficiaries are the 2021 rookie class as they become Restricted Free Agents in 2025. This might benefit teams as the cap hold for these players will be lower than normal as a percentage of cap space, so they would be able to utilize cap space first then resign RFAs using bird rights.

"I agree that he was undervalued in previous years. But him being looked at as a 15th man now is really just down to a two-year absence. [Steph](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/stephen-curry/) and [KD](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/kevin-durant/) were under-projected last year as well, having missed most/all of 2019-20. They're (most probably) both still under-projected because of that, but markedly less now than a year ago -- and the upward correction for Steph was more substantial than for KD because he played more in 2020-21."
"Yeah. Note the players that Kevin Durant are matched with. It's all players that was good, had an off/injury season, came back to more or less where they were and then dropped off. It's also worth noting that Kevin Durant is already 33. Even without injuries, you'd expect him to start dropping off now.  Also, Klay Thompson haven't played a minute of basketball in 2 seasons. Why would you assume that he's back to anywhere close to where he was?"

"Are you seriously going to go with the ""LeBron should have stayed with Cleveland and tried winning it all with Mo Williams"" argument?   Are you going to piss on Magic and Bird because they needed superteams? Or Duncan? Or Kobe?   Oh... just the guy who get draft by a shit team and then fumbles the ball trying to build around him.   Curry had Klay, Dray, and Barnes, and then upgraded from Barnes to Kevin Durant.   Do you honestly think that LeBron would have left Cleveland if they had a squad that good?   Nice false analogy pal.   And yeah... a 36-year-old LeBron lost to the Sun with AD on the injured list.   Meanwhile, Curry didn't even make the playoffs this year... so what's that say about him?   I'm asking you here. I wouldn't make such an absurd claim like you. Curry is fantastic. But you act like good fortune decides whose great. And that is a pathetic argument.   Changing teams doesn't make you better or worse. It's all about context. And if you can't understand how nuanced that is, it isn't worth talking to you."

Great on ball defender. There was on western conference series Clippers Vs Thunder and Chris Paul locked up Kevin Durant for multiple late game possessions
"Since Lebron's career has been so long, you could say he's had a few rivalries.  Stephen Curry for sure.  Kevin Durant as well (on OKC and the Warriors).  But you could also say Boston's Big 3 were a rivalry, too. He battled them in Cleveland and it forced Lebron to take his tallents to South Beach so he could actually fight fire with fire.   Maybe even Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginnobli, too. Lebron's first Finals appearance was against the Spurs. You also had those epic back to back Finals fights between the Heat and the Spurs."
"You gotta split LeBron’s career in 2 main pieces:   •Spurs (Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard) Tim Duncan caused the most damage offensively, so I would consider Tim Duncan to be his greatest rival from 07-14.  •Warriors (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala) Stephen Curry has played longer than KD on the warriors and has had a leader role for almost his  whole career, thats why I believe Stephen Curry is LeBron’s greatest rival from 2015 to now."
"11. Hakeem Olajuwon   12. Kevin Durant   13. Stephen Curry  14. Moses Malone  15. David Robinson  16. Oscar Robertson  17. Julius Erving  18. Karl Malone  19. Dirk Nowitzki  20. Kevin Garnett  But I don’t know, I didn’t really think too hard about it…lol"
"Neither you nor anyone has countered what I said though. Let’s forget about opinions, let’s look at facts  Who came in second place to Lebron in 2012 in MVP voting? KD, Steph wasn’t even an All star in 2012 and played only 26 games  Who came in second to Lebron in the 2012 NBA finals? KD  Who was unanimous FMVP in 2017 against Lebron? KD  Who was the FMVP in 2018 against Lebron again? KD  Who’s one of best players on the Nets who’s favored against the Lebron/AD/Russ Lakers this season? KD  KD is lebron’s main rival and has been before Steph was even an All star and the Warriors had any relevancy.  2 out of Steph’s 3 rings against Lebron, who was the finals mvp including Unanimous finals MVP?  Yea exactly   Bron and KD have a decade long rivalry Steph been his rival for what? 6 years?  Forget espn. Let’s talk the facts. Here’s lebrons comment in 2012 &gt; LeBron:”I know there is someone, somewhere, trying to take my spot. And I know where he is too. He's in Oklahoma. He's my inspiration because I see the direction he's headed, and it's the same direction I'm headed. I know his mind-set, and he knows mine. It's a collision course. We're driving one another.""  https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-durant-rivalry-2012-12  Here’s Kds in 2011  &gt; Durant, though, almost goes out of his way to downplay a budding rivalry. “It's kind of cool for the fans of the game. But as a player, you just want to go out there and play,” Durant said. “You don't want to take anything from your teammates or the organization. I don't want it to be Kevin Durant versus LeBron James. I want it to be the Thunder versus the Heat.”  https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3536713/kevin-durant-vs-lebron-james-the-next-great-nba-rivalry  For anyone who doesn’t agree, mind explaining what steph and the Warriors were doing 2011/2012? Yea exactly lol."
"Maybe Dan Marino and Reggie Miller. Both very respected, but just played in eras before the real value of how to best utilize their skillset was realized.   Adrian Peterson and Russell Westbrook. Work ethic, extreme physicality, great teammates, MVP seasons around a rare statistical feat (2000 yard season, triple-double season). AP's catching out of the backfield = Westbrook's jumpshooting.  Josh Allen and Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi's jumpshooting = Allen's accuracy. Once both figured those out, they were superduperstars.  Aaron Rodgers and Kevin Durant. Both respected more by purists of their respective sports than by national media, it seems like. Both misused earlier in their career (KD at SG and Rodgers on the bench.) Both have pretty fundamentally unmimic-able games. Both have been MVP and best players on championship teams. Both overshadowed by having one of the best all-time players in the sport playing at their position during their career. Both can seem bored during games, and can quietly have unbelievable statistical games. And most importantly, both are pretty emo dudes.  Lamar Jackson and Giannis. Extremely unusual physical tools, really unlimited potential for improvement. Perennial playoff contenders in small cities where they're by far the most famous athlete.    Jalen Ramsey and Anthony Davis. Both cried their way out of bad teams to get to LA so that they didn't have to have the responsibility of being the best player on a team."
"It is Kevin Durant and its not particularly close. No other great players prime lined up with Lebrons like KD, think about it those are two guys who have been considered the best players in the world for a decade plus now. The fact other people are mentioning entire teams shows just how difficult it is to make a case for any one player besides KD. They played each other in the finals 3 times!"
Kevin Durant
Aaron Rodgers is Kevin Durant
"I'll start with one that seems weird given history but I believe to be true: Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson  With Curry off the court Klay often started having tunnel vision at times and they just didn't mesh well as two ""score first"" players  Statically KD/Draymond lineups were actually only like 2 points worse than with Curry on the court, but KD/Klay/Draymond lineups were actually worse than lineups with only KD and no one else"
"I only disagree with this cause 4 of Steph’s matchups with Lebron was shared with KD, who has literally been Brons rival for a decade or so.  Also KD has more overall accolades, and a longer prime than Steph. KD literally finished 2nd behind Lebron in MVP votes in 2011, was in the finals against Lebron in 2012, and had this in 2013  &gt;Oklahoma City's wunderkind is one of the best players of his generation, but he's not the best. LeBron is. Just like it is LeBron who has won the MVP award three times to Durant's two second-place finishes. LeBron is the one with the ring, a piece of jewelry that came at Durant's expense.And it's LeBron who has cast a shadow over Durant's illustrious career. He's always been one step ahead, one accomplishment further along than his friend.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  KD and Brons history extents too far longer than Steph’s. These 2 were rivals during a time when Steph was missing tons of games due to ankle injuries and the Warriors were irrelevant. I can’t say Steph is the 2nd best of this generation nor is he Lebrons chief rival. He literally was not even an all star when KD and Bron first faced off in the finals"
"KD has been considered 2nd to lebron for well over 10 years. Also, Steph was Lebrons chief rival for what? 2 years before KD came? When KD went there, the convo was mostly KD and Lebron, not Steph and lebron.. first take and other shows discussed this relentlessly. 2 of Steph’s 4 finals aganist Lebron, KD was the finals MVP and the clear cut best player every finals, including a unanimous FMVP lol.  KD in 2013, was so fed up with being behind lebron he even had an article about jt  &gt;The Thunder had the best regular-season record in the West but finished with the second-best record in the NBA. They were Western Conference champions only last season but fell to the Heat in the finals. He had an epic 2012-13 campaign, but LeBron's was better. Now, Durant is ready for his turn. He will (likely) finish second in MVP voting for a third time, and his statistical heroics are once again eclipsed by those of someone else, specifically LeBron—which has to be infuriating. Oklahoma City's wunderkind is one of the best players of his generation, but he's not the best. LeBron is. Just like it is LeBron who has won the MVP award three times to Durant's two second-place finishes. LeBron is the one with the ring, a piece of jewelry that came at Durant's expense. And it's LeBron who has cast a shadow over Durant's illustrious career. He's always been one step ahead, one accomplishment further along than his friend.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  KD also finished 2nd behind only lebron in MVP voting in 2011/2012. KD has been behind that man for a decade.  Steph curry wasn’t even an all star when these 2 first faced off in the finals and were first being debated as the #1 and #2 best players on the league, In fact this was a time when Steph faced his injury issues. Warriors wasn’t even a factor  From OKC/Heat  Warriors/Cavs  Now even the anticipation for Nets/Lakers  KD and Bron have been rivals for far longer than Steph has even been relevant.   Literally at the start of last decade, who was behind Lebron in MVP voting in 2010??  In 2012? Who was runner up to the Heat in the finals   In 2017/2018, who was the finals MVP after beating Lebron twice??  For the Nets and the lakers, 2 favorites this season, who are the two best players on each team?  Yea my point exactly….These 2 have been rivals since Steph was only a couple years into the league and The Warriors were irrelevant. A decade long rivalry vs a 6 year long rivalry, in which who was FMVP for 2 of Steph’s 3 rings against Lebron?? Yea my point exactly"
"I think the important part of the context here is it’s not just the ages that make a super team a super team. Age, free agency vs. trades, and the level of talent are all relevant.  Even if the Nets are roughly the same age as the 2008 Celtics were when they formed, KD and Kyrie chose Brooklyn and if you look at All-NBA as a metric for the top 15 guys in the league, Harden made first team for 6 of the last 7 years and is repeatedly top 5 in MVP voting before he was traded. No one thought the Nets were a super team with just KD and Kyrie. Just a really good team. They added a top 5 guy in the league even if you want to say he’s past his prime, he’s undoubtedly top 10 right now. That’s what makes them super.  Pierce had 4 All-NBA selections. 3 times 3rd and once 2nd.  Allen had 2 All-NBA selections. Once 2nd and once 3rd.  KG was the only guy you could say was top 5.  What the Nets have here would be like if the Celtics had just KG and Pierce, and then traded for Duncan, Kobe or Nash instead of Ray Allen. It’s just not the same thing when you have James Harden and Kevin Durant on the same team imo.  Even if you want to classify them as a super team and say they started it, the 07-08 Celtics are definitely the weakest when you stack them up to the Heatles, Durant Warriors, and current Nets."
"&gt;Steph led Warriors.  Most people don’t look at it that way. KD is seen as Brons biggest rival over the past decade, after Kobe. People can argue about who led those Warriors teams but in the finals, most of the conversation is about Kevin Durant, good and bad"
"&gt;Interestingly, LeBron still has more 3-pointers made than Klay (around 200 more), and way more than Kevin Durant (over 300 more)   not really when u find out they been hurt for a minute"
"In my biased opinion I think there is a difference.   Boston traded for Ray and KG and there was no orchestrating by the players. Ainge was tanking the year prior to draft Kevin Durant and when the lottery balls didn't fall he flipped his assets for stars to put around Paul Pierce.   Miami was the first superteam of the player empowerment era in that players would team up to achieve their shared goals.   Bostons involvement is that they kept denying lebron his finals appearances, leading to the decision.   I think there should be a difference in superteams like the Nets where players are signing up to ride the ring train and teams like the (pre KD) Warriors that just became super"
u play as giannis does where you’re banging bodies in the paint and try guard kevin fucking durant for 40 mins a game
Nah. Not after his slow start to his career. Certainly not after he gave the keys to his team to kevin durant.

Kawhi Leonard 2019 5. LeBron James 2013 6. Dirk Nowitzki 2011 7. Kobe Bryant 2010 8. Draymond Green 2016 9. Kawhi Leonard 2014 10. Andre Iguodala 2015"
"Yes, Kevin Durant is over 15 percent body fat. You shouldn’t trust any numbers from players or the nba stats"
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant for the easy counter there. A lot of people overestimate how lean people can look at different percentages, and a lot of that comes from inconsistent measuring techniques.  I tried a quick Google in hopes of proving my point, but it turns out the NBA uses wonky measurements. [These](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/) are the numbers from the combine and they make no sense at all."
Oklahoma City Thunder - Russell Westbrook/Kevin Durant  I know Westbrook stuck around for a couple years after Durant left but KD is so much better that I've got him by a pretty comfortable margin as the OKC goat.
Kevin Durant for Jason Kidd... No thanks
Lmao did you just try to compare Jason Kidd to Kevin fucking Durant????
"He sort of explains why he was playing like that after the play style got exposed in [this interview time mark is 2:10](https://youtu.be/gVZeGCTDLPw), it got overshadowed by him saying that he’s Kevin Durant and everyone knows who he is though."
"Been a chiefs fan all my life, have been a Nets fan ever since they moved to Brooklyn 😎 you have no idea how sick it is having Patrick Mahomes and Kevin Durant and your two fav teams, I’m hella lucky"
"Yeah uhh......Kevin Durant should not be getting 39% of first place votes for preseason MVP choices. This also shows you how much narrative has flipped for KDs favor when KD isnt even the best choice for MVP on his own team, Harden has had a better reg season MVP candidacy for like 5 straight yrs now and was at 6%"
"1. Kevin Durant | Brooklyn Nets: 45 points (38.9% first-place votes)  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo | Milwaukee Bucks: 38 points (33.3% first-place votes)  3. Luka Doncic | Dallas Mavericks: 35 points (16.7% first-place votes)  4. Joel Embiid | Philadelphia 76ers: 14 points (5.6% first-place votes)  5. James Harden | Brooklyn Nets: 11 points (5.6% first-place votes)  6. Stephen Curry | Golden State Warriors: 10 points  7. LeBron James | Los Angeles Lakers: 7 points  Those are  the MVP predictions and the Nets are #1 for Champion with 80 points,Lakers 2nd with 49,Bucks 3rd with 30 and nobody else got more than 4 points in the vote"
"KD was like fuck the ""warriors offense,"" I'm Kevin Durant."
"For elite players, floor/ceiling raising generally refers to their play-style and what role they would suit best on an elite team.  Ball-dominate/Heliocentric players like Harden or Lebron are called floor raisers because their play-style means they are best used when you build a whole offense around them and tend to lose value with the ball out of their hands (though Harden on the Nets has changed that perception a bit).  Its not they don't raise teams ceilings, its that you are better off accommodating a team around them instead of having them accommodate a team.  Contrast this with Kevin Durant who is often described as a ceiling raiser, not because he can't raise your team's floor, but because his skillset and playstyle means he doesn't need an offense built around him to maximize his value and he doesn't run into fit problems as much as other players.  People are getting confused because they are focused on the literal meaning and don't understand what the actual reason those terms came into existence.  The primary purpose to provide a shorthand to help describe how a player would fit on a playoff team."
"Kevin Durant, he doesn’t join the warriors he doesn’t win a ring most likely and isn’t talked abt in the same fashion. 15-20 of the top players could’ve gone to that team and won with increased production as well"

But I also think it’s funny how so many players, coaches, and people surrounding the league rate Kobe so highly among all-time greats yet people on here dismiss Kobe &gt; Duncan as a casual take.   Even considering accolades and statistics, the argument is very close, with it boiling down to what you value more and how you define greatness.   Bruce Bowen, who played with Duncan, has Kobe 2nd all-time. As do many great players, like Kevin Durant. The list goes on and on. I’m not saying I necessarily agree (I have Bryant at 7, Duncan at 8), but for people bunch in actual professional players and coaches with casuals seems silly."

"You're telling me, gun to your head, you wouldn't pick Mike Conley over Kevin Durant? Madness."
"Kyrie's reputation as a playoff performer is almost entirely due to the one shot in game 7.  In fact, Kyrie and PG have been two of the least clutch playoff scorers of the past decade.   Worst eFG% in clutch situations (last 5 minutes; game within 5 points) in the playoffs from 2011-2021 (min. 40 FGA):  |Rk|Player|FG|FGA|eFG%^| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|42|156|.292| |2|DeMar DeRozan|17|54|.324| |3|John Wall|16|48|.354| |4|LaMarcus Aldridge|15|45|.356| |5|Kyrie Irving|13|42|.357| |6|Klay Thompson|20|66|.371| |7|Zach Randolph|25|64|.398| |8|Paul George|22|67|.403| |9|Jayson Tatum|16|42|.405| |10|Manu Ginobili|18|49|.408| |11|Dirk Nowitzki|19|50|.410| |12|Bradley Beal|17|46|.413| |13|Khris Middleton|27|75|.413| |14|Mike Conley|27|72|.417| |15|LeBron James|84|224|.429| |16|Joe Johnson|31|79|.437| |17|James Harden|50|130|.438| |18|Tony Parker|35|83|.446| |19|Chris Bosh|18|43|.453| |20|Kevin Durant|78|186|.460| |21|Tim Duncan|23|50|.460| |22|George Hill|17|43|.465| |23|Nikola Jokic|18|44|.466| |24|Rajon Rondo|21|46|.467| |25|Stephen Curry|49|131|.473| |26|CJ McCollum|26|64|.477| |27|Damian Lillard|36|90|.478| |28|Danny Green|16|44|.489| |29|Marc Gasol|25|53|.500| |30|Dwyane Wade|54|112|.504| |31|Chris Paul|40|87|.506| |32|Jimmy Butler|27|60|.517| |33|Draymond Green|24|50|.520| |34|Donovan Mitchell|19|40|.525| |35|Al Horford|33|65|.531| |36|Kawhi Leonard|49|107|.533| |37|Jeff Teague|23|50|.550| |38|Kyle Lowry|31|59|.576| |39|Giannis Antetokounmpo|27|48|.583| |40|Paul Pierce|30|59|.585| |41|Jamal Murray|25|51|.598| |42|J.J.

Idk anyone who watched Wall and would think that his play was acceptable let alone great  He was one of the worst high volume players last year when he decided to do his Kevin Durant impression
"I find it hilarious when fans on the sub claim that players better be loyal because they need the fans to get money and respect. Like I understand it when it comes to scrubs and cult favorites, but do these pansies really think LeBron James, Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard is gonna have a shortage of fame and fortune lol.   Nets fans were among the ""Screw KD"" crowd for 3 years, did a complete 180 when he joined them. Plenty of Lakers fans disliked LeBron because of comparisons with Kobe before he joined us, didn't take a single second to sing his praises when he landed here. Superstars don't care where the cheers and the checks come from, as long as they keep on coming."
Kevin Durant &gt; Lebron James
Steph Curry &gt; Kevin Durant
"At 2:00, they literally leave Kevin motherfucking Durant unguarded in order to double team Curry."
Kevin Durant :)
Kevin Durant&gt; Kobe
"&gt;Kevin Durant's iso is anything but inefficient. In fact, it's more efficient than a lot of players taking a set shot.  I'm not talking about Durant, I'm talking about team offenses. Iso scoring is objectively a less efficient offense."
"I guess we’ll disagree on whether well-set screens are considered creating offense or not. And my point with the player comparisons is that not all stars are paid for excellent performance on both ends of the floor. Some players, like a LeBron, are elite at practically every aspect of the game but many others aren’t, like Rudy Gobert’s offense James Harden’s defense for example. Rudy gets paid mainly for his defensive abilities and his offensive intangibles, such as screens. But, do keep in mind that he isn’t paid the supermax by the Jazz in part because of what he lacks on the offensive end, and in part because the Jazz need the money elsewhere to be true contenders.   And the All-Star game is just a night of entertainment and is full of flashy offensive moves. Anyone, including LeBron and Kevin Durant can recognize that Rudy’s abilities aren’t flashy or fun, but they do matter in real, complete basketball which the All-Star game definitely is not. I don’t think anyone was surprised that Rudy was picked last, and most of the disrespect was towards the Jazz stars generally thanks to the fact that Donovan Mitchell was the second-to-last player picked.  And you being a Lakers fan isn’t relevant, so my apologies if I came off as rude. It’s just in my blood as a basketball fan to slander the Lakers organization and their fans but I really don’t mean anything by it.  Carry on!"
 Greg Oden &gt; Kevin Durant
Aww man that just ain't fair to KG. Durant had several team mates during his OKC tenure that were better than anything Kevin Garnet had.
"Allen Iverson   Anthony Davis   Carmelo Anthony   Chris Paul   Damian Lillard   Dennis Rodman   Dirk Nowitzki   Dominique Wilkins   Dwayne Wade   Dwight Howard   Gary Payton   Giannis Antetokounmpo   James Harden   Jason Kidd   Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant   Kevin Garnett   Klay Thompson   Kobe Bryant   Kyrie Irving   LeBron James   Manu Ginobili   Pau Gasol   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Reggie Miller   Russell Westbrook   Stephen Curry   Steve Nash   Tim Duncan   Tony Parker   Tracy McGrady   Vince Carter"
"Assuming no injuries, Kevin Durant would have another championship under his belt."
There are very few players I could think of who would be less capable of being a coach than Kevin Durant lol.
"Lol, i don’t know why your feelings got hurt because of this. He was the one choosing to go to a team with Kevin Durant so i don’t feel the need to cut him slack about never having a team built around him. If he would’ve wanted a team to build around him, he wouldn’t go to a team with Kevin Durant, its pretty easy."
He was the one choosing to go to a team with Kevin Durant so i don’t think anyone needs to cut him any slack about this.
I mean yeah the team is gonna look a lot worse if you subtract Kevin fucking Durant from it
"R/NBA CENSORED MY SELF-POST PLEASE SHARE THIS BEFORE IT IS DELETED   Tl;dr: Kyrie is undoubtedly influenced by and spreading the message of the hate group/conspiracy cult the Nation of Islam to impressionable people, and I have undeniable proof. It is an imperative that people know that a multi-millionaire athlete with millions of fans and the ability to bank roll the dissemination of this misinformation through social media marketing supports people who are unquestionably anti-Semitic, conspiratorial ,anti-vax, pseudo-intellectual, racist, anti-lgbtq+ and hateful (and Kevin Durant, JR Smith, Stephen Jackson and DeSean Jackson may be involved/complicit in this as well).   While doing research on the hate group and conspiracy cult the Nation of Islam, I found the following video/Facebook post from October2nd, 2020: https://www.facebook.com/brotherbenx/videos/kyrie-irving/753613808552135/ From a “Brother Ben X” Facebook page. In this video recording of what appears to be a Kyrie Instagram live Q&amp;A, he states that he will not be talking about politics “because with that, there comes a different language, and we will save that for a later day because I have incredible leaders that are on the front lines, shout out to my man stack 5,Steve Jack you know shoutout to 19 keys, you know, shoutout to Brother Ben X, shoutout to, just, like I said I go through an array of DMs a day and doin’ my job to connect as best as I can.”  This is when the video cuts off. As you may already know, Stephen Jackson was a part of the DeSean Jackson controversy of supporting anti-Semitism and Louis Farrakhan(https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29428606/stephen-jackson-says-eagles-desean-jackson-speaking-truth-controversial-posts)the notorious leader of the Nation of Islam who has preached wonderful things such as:                   “You are not real Jews, those of you that are not real Jews. You are the synagogue of Satan, and you have wrapped your tentacles around the U.S. government, and you are deceiving and sending this nation to hell. But I warn you in the name of Allah, you would be wise to leave me alone. But if you choose to crucify me, know that Allah will crucify you.”  “And the Christian right, with your blindness to that wicked state of Israel … can that be the holy land, and you have gay parades, and want to permit to have a gay parade in Jerusalem when no prophet ever sanctioned that behavior. How can that be the Israel, how can that be Jerusalem with secular people running the holy land when it should be the holy people running the holy land. That land is gonna be cleansed with blood!”  “Osama Bin Laden didn’t destroy the Twin Towers. That was a false flag operation to take the world’s attention away from the great disunity in America after George W. Bush stole the election.”  “I’m not an anti-Semite. I’m anti-Termite.”  Quotes from the Southern Poverty Law Center    This is not even close to an exhaustive list of the hate and conspiracy that Farrakhan and his associates in the Nation of Islam have said, but how does this relate to Kyrie? He didn’t say shoutout Farrakhan after all and shouting out Stephen Jackson is not the same as endorsing all of his views. Well in the previously mentioned Facebook post by Brother Ben X, who Kyrie shouted out to over 16k people watching him live, Brother Ben X makes his ties to Farrakhan explicit. In the body of the post is the following: “so, when she said ‘I hear Ben X all the time,’ I said yeah, you’re hearing Me... through Ben!”- Minister Louis Farrakhan (September 17th, 2020)   I watched about 2 minutes of another Brother Ben X video(https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1256414397835492 )where he states that black people are trillions of years old and that white people have only existed for 6k years before I turned off the browser for fear of my brain being fried further. Brother Ben X’s Facebook (600k+ likes 1.2m followers) has plenty of other videos about Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, he doesn't even attempt to hide his ties. The Nation of Islam and its supporters believe a wide range of conspiracies ranging from scientology's dianetics to the Jewish New World Order conspiracy to the NOI classic of the evil scientist Yakub who accidentally created the evil white race through breeding them on an island just to name a few.   This 19 keys turns out to be an Instagram account with 300kfollowers which Brother Ben X has also shouted out on Facebook as part of his BWO program which is some sort of program you must pay for in order to receive classes on things like real estate and private banking (??? Have not looked into this deeply):https://www.facebook.com/brotherbenx/videos/bwo-program/1047497469107279/?__so__=permalink&amp;__rv__=related_videos   This 19 keys Instagram posts motivational quotes, cryptocurrency advice as well as Nation of Islam conspiracy. One post(https://www.instagram.com/p/CLVMouyDkxv/) quotes Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam from 1934-1975. Elijah Muhammad was a humble man who has just as many wonderful quotes as Louis such as:   (5 days after the death of Malcom X) “Malcolm got just what he preached.”    Or from Elijah’s book Message to the Blackman in America(1965) which is 5 stars on Amazon with over 2k reviews and suggests black people segregate themselves from the rest of society “either here or elsewhere.”:  “The so-called American Negroes have never had a Divine Messenger sent to them before the Honorable Elijah Muhammad”  “Beware of the national elections, my black brothers and sisters. There is no salvation in them for you—only false promises. The only salvation for you and me now is in unity and being under the guidance of Allah through His Messenger and His program for us all.”   Clearly Elijah was a humble prophet.    I do not see how Kyrie Irving can shoutout these people(19_keys and Brother Ben X)  without being aware of the hate and conspiracies that are a part of these people’s belief systems. This is a man who believed the flat-earth shit for fuck's sake and he admits he reads random peoples DMs to “connect.” Sure it’s possible Kyrie is totally against or ignorant of the Nation of Islam connection or what the Nation of Islam believes, but this seems much less likely than the possibility Kyrie has been radicalized.     Why does all this matter, why not let kooks be kooks? Because along with spreading hate, the Nation of Islam also is anti-vaccination and regularly warns their followers to not get the Covid vaccine due to x y or z conspiracy (Bill Gates comes up a lot). I do not hate Kyrie Irving or the people who believe these things, however it is an imperative that people know that a multi-millionaire athlete with millions of fans and the ability to bankroll the dissemination of this misinformation through social media marketing supports people who are unquestionably anti-Semitic, conspiratorial, anti-vax, pseudo-intellectual, racist, anti-lgbtq+ and hateful (and Kevin Durant, JR Smith, Stephen Jackson and DeSean Jackson may be involved/complicit in this as well).    I googled Kyrie Irving and the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan and saw nothing talking about this. Please share this information with journalists or on social media. People need to know that Kyrie is leading impressionable people into a literal conspiracy cult. I also from here on it will refuse to give any money to the NBA until this is addressed and urge those who care to do the same"
What bouncer would deny the guest of Kevin Durant who is about to drop a butt load of cash there.
"Let’s go through a list of some notable players who refer to Jrue Holiday as one of the game’s best three defenders or as the league’s most underrated players:   [Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Andre Iguodala, Lou Williams, Joe Ingles, JJ Redick.](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2020/9/9/21428836/jrue-holiday-giannis-lebron-james-ja-morant-all-defensive-pelicans-bucks-clippers-beverley-bledsoe)"
"If you actually believe that Joel Embiid suddenly became better than Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant from mid-range, go ahead. Just don’t cry when he isn’t in the playoffs lmao."
"Kris Dunn, Kevin Durant and Kobe?"
"Draymond may be the ""heartbeat of the Warriors"" and is one of my favorite players.  One may make the argument that not only did he lose this game for the Warriors, but he also lost them Kevin Durant and the 2016 NBA Championship when he got suspended"
[yeah i think heard this kenyon morant guy say so](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27974397/kevin-durant-says-draymond-green-altercation-factored-decision-leave-warriors)  not sure how well he knows kd
1. LeBron James    2. Larry Bird     3. Kevin Durant     4. Julius Erving     5. John Havlicek     6. Kawhi Leonard      7. Rick Barry     8. Scottie Pippen      9. Elgin Baylor     10. Dominique Wilkins
"I mean you’re a Nets fan so you’ll always say that the Nets are better but be honest with me. Golden State had a better offense because of all the back screens and off ball movement you don’t quite see that often from the Nets. You had the greatest PG maybe ever playing with Kevin Durant while Green was setting extremely high IQ screens to open up Klay Thomson, the greatest spot up shooter in history while also having better big man play. The Warriors that year was like watching the Jazz now with twice the talent. The Nets have more offensive talent but that doesn’t correlate to being the better offensive team. The Warriors that year were the second greatest offensive team in history only behind the 86’ Celtics who were literally the greatest team in NBA history due to the passing and off ball movement."
This reminded me of [one of my favorite Onion articles](https://sports.theonion.com/kevin-durant-accidentally-reveals-nba-uses-system-of-ro-1819571930) when I was a teenager.
"Harden and Kyrie will ABUSE Thybulle and Harris. Simmons can't guard KD on every position, even though he did you think Ben Simmons can stop Kevin Durant? Possibly the most unguardable player ever, Damn y'all forget real quick. Nothing is a set in the NBA but don't think Simmons/ Thybulle/ Harris can lock the Nets up."
"Don't pre-emptively complain about downvotes, it's not a good look. You have a direct quote from Kevin Durant you don't need to defend your take."
The Cavs are a super team lmao. Just because the warriors blew them out the water with a better super team doesn't mean the Cavs weren't. These lebron stans are lunatics. If the warriors didn't have Durant. The Cavs would most likely have won back to back rings with there super team. Lebron went to Cavs with Kevin love to create a super team. Just how boston did back in the day.
Never forget that Kevin Durant stole three years of peak NBA entertainment by reducing the need for Steph on the offense.
"Tom Brady: lebron Patrick mahomes: trae young Lamar Jackson: Giannis  Aaron Donald: this could be lebron too, but there is no direct comparison Deshuan Watson: James harden, both really good, and both forced their way out of Houston  Aaron Rodgers: Kevin Durant, great but not better than the king Devante adams:idk Raheem mostart: deaaron fox Derrick Henry: Giannis/embiid Drew brees: Carmelo Anthony  Barry sanders:also Carmelo ig Jamarcus Russell: Anthony Bennett"
"He wouldn't it's not that clear cut, he's not even leading the betting odds       LeBron James +180  Joel Embiid +450  Nikola Jokic +500  Luka Doncic +1000  Giannis Antetokounmpo +1200  Steph Curry +1200  Kevin Durant +1400  Damian Lillard +2500  Kawhi Leonard +4000  Donovan Mitchell +6600"
Kevin Durant.
"What is he better at tho... Steph is so good at that, that teams will sell out double teams to stop him and give Kevin Fucking Durant or Klay 60 points on 9 dribbles Thompson open to do so lmao Kawhi is better built to bang in the midrange and fight his way to the bucket sure. Steph at his peak is a better shooter, better in the midrange, finishes better at the rim...  Just cuz Kawhi can muscle his way to the paint doesn’t necessarily make him better, Steph can get similar results with finesse and he can just bomb away in a way Kawhi could only dream"
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
Kevin Durant: Am I a joke to you?
"Eh he played his whole career in a conference with Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant at the forward spot in the West. Kobe also ended up at SF starting a few times leaving only 1 forward spot.   Also, tbh, even though he is revered now, Dirk was never really a fan favorite outside of Dallas during his prime. Never sold that many Jerseys, also wasn't big on doing marketing for branding. So he was never one to rack up fan votes. Duncan wasn't big on those either but he had the championship pedigree."

Do you know who Kevin Durant is
Is Kevin Durant playing?
So Zach can’t be All-NBA because his team doesn’t have James Harden and Kevin Durant on it. Seems fair
"I personally like a Steph/Giannis matchup more. Steph/Giannis's court chemistry in that All-Stars game was pretty fun.  But also Steph kind of matches with anyone, and the dudes everyone chases (Kawhi/Giannis/Kevin Durant) just mesh well with most guys in general too. Reason everyone wants 'em."
"NBA tries to get premier games in prime time slots. (See LAL v BKN last night). I am an NBA fan and those are the games I watch during the regular season (and Celtics games ;)).   As for picking a favorite team, find a player you enjoy to watch and/or like their story and follow their games. NBA is a star driven league so it’s not hard.   As for understanding the game, the elite level of athleticism and size of the NBA makes seemingly impossible things look common. Enjoy the speed (Kyrie), physicality (lebron, giannis), athleticism (donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Zion) and skill (curry, jokic) for a time.   Then you can watch how teams set their stars up to have the most success ( screens, isolations, ball movement), how the other teams defend that (switch’s, double teams, spacing). Once you notice that you will see how the best players are nearly impossible to stop because of their uniqueness (like Kevin Durant).   If watching a whole game is too much, watch the fourth quarter. That is when things get really interesting. Also, playoff games are really a different thing. More physical, more drama, more everything. Follow the storylines of series and you will start to understand more.   Good luck on your basketball journey!"
"Just highlights some separate issues here.   1.  Relying on a fan vote for starters, basically just becomes a popularity contest.  Heck people literally just submit votes for everyone on their team whether they deserve it or not ""like me"" each year, and the idea you can vote as much as you want just encourages well known players at the top to just stay there.  I like the idea of the final spot being a fan vote, but not the whole starting team.   2.  Highlights also why we can't go by subjective criteria like ""Nobody is more feared then Damian Lillard"".  What does this even mean?  That people would rather face Lebron or Kevin Durant instead of Damian Lillard, therefore he should be an All Star Starter?  Highly subjective and by no means indicative of who truly ""deserves"" to be an All Star (which itself is also subjective, maybe people do think Damian Lillard should start solely because he is ""feared"", who knows right.   3.  Siakam's first name is Pascal"
"Ja Morant, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, Lebron James"
They became the team that had the best regular season in history*****  Would you honestly take that team over any other in history? Even over the next years version that swapped out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant?
"POV Youre the lakers:  Kevin durant is out. Phew. Kyrie’s not getting it done, nice. Alright now let’s just lock down harden and it’s a done deal, easy. Wait, what’s this? They still got Joe “Joey Buckets” Harris wide fuckin open."
"Any combo? Okay. Here’s three lineups I’m confident could win  Offense:  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson  Defense:  Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Gary Payton  Modern:  Anthony Davis(uninjured), LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo"
"Not to shit on Joe Harris; he's an excellent shooter. Having said that, any competent three point threat would have roided up numbers if they were starting on the Nets.  Harris is good, but lets be real. He's putting up those numbers because he's got so much freedom to shoot the ball because the Nets have Kyrie, Harden, and Durant. If Joe Harris is putting 40 on you, your defensive game is pretty god damn good.  Harris is a good shooter, it just bugs me when people attribute  his numbers to his growth or him being in a ""system that allows him to finally shine"". Its none of that. He is just a good three point shooter on a team with James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant."
Damn long time since I seen a (gsw Kevin Durant) flair. Nice to see GSW still loves him
Best Player &gt; Season  Kevin Durant is still the second best basketball player in the NBA besides LeBron.
The best offensive team.... without Kevin Durant.
"alternatively, the Nets are still very good even without Kevin fuckin Durant"
Yeah but there is also this Kevin Durant guy who would be playing
"This team has Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden though. It almost doesn’t matter. They’re way too talented"
So you would rather have AD and Shroughdur over Kevin Durant? Lmao
&gt;&gt; Be Kevin Durant &gt;&gt; Le hardest road
"If you told someone eleven years ago that LeBron James and Kevin Durant would be future opposing All Star Captains, I don’t think they would be surprised.  How do you think they’d react when you clarify what conference they each represent?"
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Russell Westbrook 11. Kawhi Leonard 12. Zion Williamson 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kemba Walker 15. James Harden
Are you talking out of your ass for the sake of talking?   Beal and Harden both have identical number of games at 24. Harden missed like 3 games total in Houston.   His teammate Kyrie only has 20 games. Kevin Durant only has 19. Embiid has 23 games. Giannis has 27 games.  Which player on this list has played 10 more games than him?
"2014- Kevin Durant- It wasn't even close better record, better Stats  2015- Steph &amp; Harden, Lebron wasn't even in the conversation  2017- Russ/ Kawhi/ Harden, All had better Stats, Kawhi and Harden had better records and Russ had a Historical season  There has never been  a Season were Lebron deserved MVP and he didn't get it, Try Again"
"Well you're obviously a Harden stan, but oh well:  https://pickinsplinters.com/2020/05/14/breaking-down-james-hardens-postseason-inefficiency/  The main issue here is, just as he has forced his scoring average up by manipulating bad officiating rules, Harden has forced himself into being a mediocre shooter with poor mechanics and exceptional range, and you portray him as a great shooter. Bullshit. Stephen Curry is a great shooter, Joe Harris is a great shooter, Duncan Robinson, JJ Reddick, Joe Ingles, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, are great shooters. Harden is the China of basketball, just a manufactured knock off version of the real deal born out of a dynamic of competitive necessity following the dominance of Curry. He's boring to watch, and he won't win a ring on his own merits. Your favorite player is kind of....shit."
"They’re incredible if Basketballreference.com is where you watch all your games. Dudes playing with 2 objectively better in every way MVPs in Kevin Durant and James harden, as well as the best catch and shoot 3 pt shooter in the league right now. Of course his numbers are good. Anyone’s would be in that context."
I doubt Kevin Durant is very popular with the players after they got steamrolled for 3 years by him and the avengers
"No, I think he has a better case than Sabonis, arguable with vucevic, but Vucevic is producing on a team that has been blasted by injuries and is just generally worse than the Knicks (they might have the worst point guard situation in the NBA).  Aside from that, I would have him behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Bam Adebayo, Jayson Tatum, Khris Middleton, and Giannis. That would have him at like 7th or 8th in the eastern conference frontcourt, so no, I don't think he deserves to be an all-star."
"Probably because Westbrook’s most efficient scoring year is only better than like LeBron’s least efficient scoring year (his rookie year)  LeBron is like if you combined Russell Westbrook with Kevin Durant and averaged them out  From like 12-13 onward, KD is so efficient that just giving him the ball and letting him score is much more efficient for your team than even peak Westbrook"
"Lol LeBron averaged 34/12/9 on 63.0% TS in the 2017 Finals and 34/9/10 on 62% TS in 2018. Cleveland's second best offensive player in the 2018 Finals was Kevin ""53.5% TS"" Love and his third was fucking JR Smith. Kevin Durant had Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.   LeBron's performances were infinitely more impressive, especially when you consider the colossal gulf between Cleveland and Golden State's defenses. It's not even close."
"1. You clearly didn’t read. That other person brought up the bucks after we traded for harden, implying we can’t beat them since we lost depth. That’s the only reason I mentioned the bucks. You are mentioning the Wizards in a snarky way of dissing KD, as if KD, Kyrie, and harden didn’t all lose to the Cavs too. Your argument made no sense at all and lacked the context I had when I mentioned the bucks. Kyrie and harden both lost to the Cavs the game after so what was your point?  2. Nobody on this planet ever thought, or seriously debated Harden vs KD. He has never been a better player. That would mean for majority of Hardens prime, he would have been considered a top 2 player, cause KD has been considered #2 behind lebron so much that he eventually got sick of it. Proof  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  So We not doing this revisionist history. KD was #2 behind lebron or maybeee #3 behind lebron and Steph. Harden isn’t in that discussion.  3. I’m arguing with multiple people so perhaps that was a generalization. However. Nets were one of the favorites when it was just KD/Kyrie+ the depth they had. Like I said. KD with 1 of Harden or Kyrie can win depending on who else is on that team with role players"
"This makes no sense for several reasons.  1. KD is our leader in almost every statistical category. Losing to the Wizards in February has no bearing on a 7 game series in a playoff atmosphere.  2. Yes Harden is a great player, he has, and has never been better than Kevin Wayne Durant. That’s not even arguable. That’s never been. It wasn’t in OKC when he was coming off the bench. It wasn’t when he was in Houston. It isn’t now and everyone knows that. On no planet has Harden ever been ahead of KD on any tier or list. He’s the second best player on the team and that’s fine  3. I’m talking about in general. We not playing this game of “oh let’s give Kyrie his credit now that it matches my argument”. All year I had to hear nothing but trash on Kyrie’s name. Now suddenly he and harden can lead this nets team to the finals without KD. Nobody on this earth believes this. You don’t even believe this"
"Harden is not our best player. He’s just more durable. Nobody with a brain thinks James harden is better than Kevin Durant and I’m not even getting into that silly argument(never mind that KD is our leading scorer/Rebounder/Best defender/leader in blocks for the nets etc)   Also, KD led a OKC team tothe finals as the best player at only 23 years old and averaged 30/6. Neither Westbrook or especially harden outperformed KD that series or playoffs.   If you are one of those people who thought Westbrook was the better player during that 2012 run. Led me know now so i can end this conversation. We not doing this lmaoo"
Harden is playing with Kyrie and Kevin Durant?
"I live in America but I only got into basketball last year. I'm from Michigan, but I don't have any strong affiliation to the Pistons. I feel like that home team spirit is something you get from being a kid and watching everyone else root for them.  Instead, I just root for the players I like watching. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Jokic and most recently Lamelo Ball are players I root for."
"Bron, MJ, Magic, Bird, Immanuel Quickley, Kareem are 100% lock. Unless he was able to do some crazy shit he’s not passing Duncan, Wilt, Bill Russell, Shaq, Kobe. then there’s guys you could make the argument either way: Hakeem, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Durant. So overall, no."
"&gt; Plus, Iverson was their starting shooting guard and leading scorer, but he was pretty much the worst shooter on the team.   You're assuming that other players on the team could have shot better, if given the same workload Iverson had.   DeAndre Jordan (76% TS) is a significantly more efficient shooter than Kevin Durant (65% TS). Does that mean KD is a worse shooter? Or does it reflect more on the fact that KD has to carry an offensive burden that DJ doesn't? Is Kevon Looney (66% TS) an equally good shooter as Steph (66% TS)? Or does Looney get much easier shots, because Steph draws all the defensive attention?   Iverson carrying the offensive workload allowed his teammates to focus on what their respective strengths were, just like KD and Steph allow their teammates to focus on other things besides creating their own offense.   If you watched the 2001 Sixers, a lot of times what would happen is Iverson would drive, draw multiple defenders, and basically just flip it up towards the rim for his teammates to get an easy offensive rebound and putback. On the stat sheet, that's a negative play for Iverson (0/1 FG). In reality, Iverson created that score by drawing the interior defenders to himself, which created the scoring opportunity for his teammates - it's as much as ""assist"" as Rudy Gobert setting a good screen, or Mark Jackson dribbling in place at the top of the key while Reggie Miller runs off 3 different screens.    In 2000-01, the Sixers were 5th in Offensive Rebounds, despite being only 19th in FGA. They were 2nd in OffReb%. That's in part due to defending bigs having to leave their man to help against Iverson.   In the 2001 Eastern playoffs, the Sixers were 7-2 when Iverson shot 30+ FGA. They were 4-5 when he shot fewer than 30 FGA. If Iverson were hurting his team by shooting, those W-L records should be reversed."
PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Julias Randle  C: Joel Embiid
"Forget about the guards, this era is talented for literally everything.   Point guards like Curry  Shooting guards like Harden  Small forwards like LeBron and Kevin Durant  Power forwards like Giannis  Centers like Jokic and Embiid  All these players will be all time great when it’s all said and done. Curry will be at least a top 2 PG of all time, Harden will be (he’s already) a top 5 SG of all time, KD and LeBron are already both in top 5 of the best SF ever, if not top 3. Jokic is a unique player, one of a kind, and Embiid is an absolute beast. Giannis is a freak of nature, literally built like no one else in the history of basketball. Then you got players like Doncic who’s 21 and is averaging like 28-8-8 or something like that. Tatum is a young stud that might go down as one of the best picks the Celtics have ever done. And I haven’t mentioned yet players like Kyrie (probably the best 1-on-1 scorer ever), Kawhi (one of the best defenders of all time), Anthony Davis, ..."
Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  Zion Williamson  KAT
"I love how Michael Malone gave Bol Bol his first real minutes of the year against Kevin Durant. Then he played him against Oubre the next game so he doesn't look like a complete dunce.  But nah giving a little run out to see if he is capable of shading this tall fucker that can't dribble or drive, only shoot 3s, that's asking for way too much.   Well I don't love it, it was some of the dumbest shit I've seen all year."

Trade Jimmy Butler for Kevin Durant
"Of course I hardly watched his games with the Warriors and other teams he’s been on. He’s on 1/30 teams and I’m not a Jordan Bell super fan.                                  Which is pretty much my point. There’s nothing special from an NBA perspective about him. There never was to begin with. You guys would have seen this potential in anyone. He had the greatest spacing of all time and the luxury of playing up 30 against 2nd teams.                                                             You got him for 3.5 mill which was dumb of the Bulls even in Hindsight. Everything worked out perfectly for you guys. All the fucking time. With Jordan Bell, the playoffs, Curry’s development, everything.                                                                 You have to expect things like Kevin Durant getting injured to happen eventually. They happen to all teams and more often than they happen to the Warriors. Jordan Bell falling short is one of hundreds of players that falls short"
I can't believe the other guy put up a three hour debate on this. The 73-9 warriors replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant.   The 2009 Miami heats second best player was Beasley and third was a 50 Year old Jermaine O'Neal...
Steph Curry wasn't considered for MVP when he had Kevin Durant on his team. Have you ever seen cases where the top 2 MVP candidates are on the same team? How often do you get 2 on the same team in the top 5?
"It would be one thing if KD was healthy and they lost, but they couldn’t even bring it to game 7 after he got hurt. I don’t buy this ""we 100% would have won"" argument regardless of how much worse he was after 1 season. He was not so much worse that it made a bigger difference than Kevin Durant.   If that makes me disingenuous in your eyes, then sorry."
"MVP is usually in cases where there is a really good team that has 1 clear best player. Stockton always had Malone. Like Steph Curry went from back to back MVP seasons and then as soon as GSW's got Kevin Durant, Curry came outside the top 5 for MVP voting."
"I get that rationale, but find it kinda weak. The influence that top NBA players have is fairly limited, and highly concentrated on younger people who aren't high risk. People over 70, with multiple underlying health conditions are the main vulnerable group that needs the vaccine. Most of these people need no convincing and are already lining up to get vaccinated. And the ones that have decided that they don't want to get the vaccine, do you really think that these 75 year olds are going to be convinced to change their mind because NBA star Kevin Durant decided to get vaccinated?"
Agreed. Knicks should go after a top guy like Kevin Durant
"MVP Steph Curry / All-NBA All-Defensive Klay Thompson / MVP Kevin Durant / All-Star Chris Mullin / All-Star DPOY Draymond Green   Bench: Andre Iguodala Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Chris Mullin, Monta Ellis, Harrison Barnes, David Lee, Andrew Bogut, Gilbert Arenas, Latrell Sprewell... sure I'm forgetting some people   Good luck Lebron lmao"
"Dudes the most important player on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on it, but his scoring stats won't be enough because he's facilitating. The assists tite is dope and being 50/40/90 is dope."
Steph Curry   Kevin Durant  Joel Embiid  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic
It took Kevin Durant making the weakest move in professional sports history to pull that off and LeBron still averaged a 30 point triple double in those series.
"Hollinger and Duncan (podcast duo) actually just finished up a 2 part series on which teams they think are the best to support over the next 5 years.   Watch some highlights, read about some players, and listen to that and I think you'll have an idea. But don't stick too hard to one team at the start, you'll find what you like over time   &gt;Is youth development different in the NBA in comparison to hockey and soccer?  Very. In the NBA teams have nothing to do with the players basically until they are drafted.    &gt;Do players that get drafted in round 1 make the roster right away, or do they play in college for 4 years and then compete for a roster spot or play on the farm team  If you're a 1st round pick your contract is already guaranteed, so the team is gonna be paying you no matter what, so they pretty much all play on the team for at least a bit. Some of them won't last on their teams and in the league, but the guys at the top all generally do. The 2nd round is a different story, their contracts aren't guaranteed and the majority of them never make their teams roster and they never play in the NBA.   Players never draft someone and have them go to college, you'll kind of see it with Europeans who get drafted by a team but stay and play in Europe, but never still going to college. To be drafted players also have to be a year removed from highschool, which usually means playing a year in college before heading to the NBA.   &gt; I understand drafts are essential but do picks have very high value or do teams just trade them continually?  Picks have a high value, but it's a pretty steep value curve, the ones at the top are worth much more than ones later on. How this value works out depends on the draft and how many good players there are. A top 3 pick in a good draft can be worth five times a pick at 12. Teams do trade picks a lot, usually as a move to help them win now at the expense of success in the future. As such most of the picks that get traded are from good teams that are expecting their picks to not be very high anyway (examples like the Nets, Lakers, Bucks), but sometimes doesn't work out and not very good teams owe picks (Rockets, TWolves, the Nets of the past).     &gt;Are there lots of young players that get drafted later rounds that actually make it to the NBA rosters or do they get trapped on the farm team and used as trade bait/salary moves?   It's pretty common for 2nd round draft picks to make it onto NBA teams. It's less than half, especially as you get to the end of the draft, but not insignificant each draft. There's also stars that every once in a while come from the 2nd round, Jokic is currently an MVP candidate and he was the 41st pick. I wouldn't say they get trapped on the farm team (in the NBA this is called the G-League), but it's pretty common for them to be sent down to get reps. You will see 2nd round picks and players moved pretty often, they aren't seen to carry a lot of value, but they are probably the cheapest asset that is still positive value.   &gt;Do top picks bust frequently, as a Canadian, I do know that the hype on Wiggins and Bennett completely died out after 1 year. I haven't kept a close eye on them but it seems that they couldn't transition their game/skills to an NBA starter level?  I wouldn't say frequently, but it definitely ain't unheard of. I think failing to make it to the level of a starter is rarer (Wiggins is actually a starter), but it's pretty common to not meet expectations.   In 2018 Marvin Bagley with the 2nd pick and probably won't be a good player, Markelle Fultz in 2017 was the 1st pick but immediately disappointed and is now just a good player, Dragan Bender in 2016 with the 4th pick is already out of the league. There seems to be at least one high level prospect per draft who doesn't get near their expectations.   &gt;I watch hockey and soccer, but the Salary Cap and contract situation in the NBA is much different, based on my understanding, it seems to promote rich owners to throw money and build super teams, so does it make the NBA a bit stale to watch?  There is a salary cap in the NBA, it's just a soft cap, and there is also a cap on the salaries of players. So you can go over the cap, but there are a bunch of restrictions to limit your ability to do so, primarily you can go over the cap to sign players that are already on your team, but you can't go over the cap to get other teams players. However, going over the cap does lead to you ending up in the luxury tax, which the more you go into the more expensive it gets  There's still a big market advantage, but it's to varying degrees. My Nets were able to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency because they are located in New York, but also because they have shown themselves to be a competent franchise who can get some modicum of success. While across the city the Knicks are the most valuable franchise in the NBA, and they haven't been able to get a free agent in close to 10 years because they are so bad. So rich owners (so long as they aren't cheap) have less impact, but the markets teams are in have an impact. The big exception to this I would say is the Lakers, who I think has just a massive free-agent advantage over other teams  On the other hand, some small-market teams are able to hold onto really high-level players over the long term. As I said before there is a player salary cap, where players can only be paid so much. But this quantity is affected by a range of things, firstly how long a player has been in the league, secondly if a player signs with their own team then they can get more and for longer, and thirdly if they are eligible for getting the supermax, which you have to reach certain performance levels for and you can only get re-signing with your team. For example, this led to Giannis Antetokounmpo resigning a 5-year supermax deal with his very small market team the Bucks   &gt;Which NBA organizations are the best to consider supporting for?    Listen to that aforementioned podcast. You want to get on board with a team that is still on the way up, and that once they get there they have a chance to stick around for a while. Just listening to your description of what you want in your team I'd consider anyone except Knicks, Nets, Lakers, Clippers, Warriors because they tend to be the centres of a lot of drama and free agent talk, and just due to competence anyone except the Twolves, Kings, or Wizards, and maybe the Pistons  Just listening to your criteria I think Grizzlies might be a strong option, they are an alright team currently, but they are built around a great young core that should find success in the future. And the franchise has an incredibly strong identity that envelops the team, the Grizzlies are synonymous with Grit and Grind and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Oh and Ja Morant pretty frequently fucks people up with his dunks"
"Look at the clutch playoff champions since 1990. Most have an elite midrange player that can create his own space. Jordan, kobe, pierce, durant, LeBron, kawhi etc. A decent size wing is always gonna be the  most important player in basketball . There is even a quote from kerr that goes:  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
"I stopped watching professional LoL years ago because it got super boring and I didn't even watch NA LCS because NA LoL has always been really bad.  It's very different from real sports because in real sports players ARE the meta, whereas you have a governing body (i.e. Rito) controlling the meta in eSports. So if some player in LoL is using a strategy that is considered OP, and then everybody does it, it makes the spectator experience completely homogenous and every game is the same.  This is completely different from something like NBA. You have Kevin Durant or you don't. You have LeBron or you don't. Teams have to work and build around what they have at a much slower pace because there's no ""patch"" that comes out and then forces your team to practice different strategies and then find whatever is the local maximum OP in any given patch."
Every team Kevin Durant has been on except the warriors then
"Check out this 538 article on why Jordan was the best. They did their All Time RAPTOR ratings and CP3 was 2nd.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-michael-jordan-was-the-best/  The entire list of current players on there is Chris Paul, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and Kevin Durant, which really tracks well with who the most important guys of all time were.  Chris Paul has just had bad playoff luck, with the injury in Houston, and honestly Doc Rivers coaching probably cost him with the Clippers. If you dig into the advanced stats the biggest reason they kept losing in the playoffs is because they let Jamal Crawford take too many of the shots and he was horribly inefficient."
"Yes Lakers fans are terrible, glad you come to realize that!   If the clippers got Kevin Durant and Giannis the season would’ve been unfair. That hypothetical is pointless. The clippers are doing well, they’re clearly better than last year."
"Same. Love the dude cause he always give 100% on the court. But when you consistently take almost as many shots as Kevin Durant as a PG, your BBIQ must not be all that high."
Haha that was such a weird boner moment. On one side all fans were sulking from the Cavs comeback.   And then Kevin fucking Durant signs.
"Dray has had some pretty terrible takes when it comes to the business side of the league. It became clear the moment he mentioned that cringe Apple/Google analogy he used with the whole ""Kevin Durant is the CEO of his own brand"" schtick."
I mean these dudes broke the regular season record for wins the year before then replaced their weakest starter with fucking Kevin Durant.
Yes similar to an argument for Joe Harris over Kevin Durant
Depends on if it’s like a Iguodala finals MVP or a Kevin Durant finals MVP

James Harden Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and it's unfair how they're all on the same team
"I've never liked this take because the NBA was already going towards this direction. In the past decade, the Warriors only led the league in 3PA or 3PM ONCE, which was in 2016, despite having the 2 best shooters in the league. Despite having Kevin Durant on top of that. They rarely even made it into the top 3 for either stat. If anything, the Rockets (mainly Morey and D'antoni) created this era. Hell, you could just give all the credit to D'antoni because the SSOL Suns were doing this shit too. Back in 2008, they led the league with 25 attempts per game which was FAR more than the 2nd place team. And that was above the league average for another decade.   That's not to say Curry won't end up being a hugely influential player. I just don't think we've even begun to see his influence. That'll be when all these young kids watching him now hit the league in the next decade. We're gonna see a whole lot of kids out here shooting like Duncan Robinson because they grew up watching Curry.   Also random fun fact - The Knicks and Magic have both led the league in 3PA and 3PM multiple times over the last 10-11 years."
"Kevin Durant, on the other hand, has to sit out the 2nd quarter."
"1. Players get labeled as cancers if want a change in situations meanwhile teams are openly trading players and expecting players to stay in shape and remain professional as they bench and trade them.  2. Organizations don’t get held to the same standards as players. Kyrie took time off for mental health during stress times and the media went crazy, Stephen A Smith called for him to retire. Sacramento  literally traded DeMarcus Cousins after the all star game and he found out during an interview.   3. Players get ridiculously fined for tampering when it’s a player driven league.  I mean he’s right, player like jimmy butler, James Harden, and Kevin Durant get labeled as cancers for wanting out when a lot of the blame has to go towards organizations."
"I can't believe how I need to point out how Harden's usage has collapsed compared to prior seasons because he is now on a team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. It's literally the lowest it has been since he was coming off the bench in OKC. You apparently seem to know that yourself, but completely disregard it?  Not to mention that despite Harden's usage being way down, he's still playing 5 minutes more per game than Stephen Curry is. Is it that unbelievable to you that Curry is averaging 1.5 less FTA than Harden?  Curry is not unfairly officiated. He does essentially the same shit (but to a lesser extent) and receives the same calls as a notorious foul-baiter. It just looks like you're trying to believe something that clearly isn't true out of some blind love for a player.  and no, I'm not trying to be an asshole. It's not that serious."
"In 2015 the Warriors were more talented, Jesus Christ  Kevin Durant played in 19 of the 24 quarters in that series and Steph was actually really underwhelming that series while Harden was really great."
"Kevin Durant has basically always been a perimeter guy.   Giannis is solid, but I've never liked how aggressively he sends people towards help instead of playing them straight.  AD doesn't generally get close enough to take out perimeter airspaces to my liking."
Lavine has literally the same TS% as Kevin fucking Durant while shooting more 3s and scoring 28 ppg so not sure what you on about
Kevin Durant and playing with a super team.   I  can't remember the last time he played with just 1 all star.
Why would a ring with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving put James Harden over Wade. Why not just say he's better than Wade now if that is all it would take to convince you.
"""Just turn and face. You've always gotta have eyes on. Alright. Now, I know this isn't the best time, but see Kevin Durant? He's a bitch. And he's always going to be a bitch"""
The 73-9 warriors didn’t win a championship. They didn’t have KD. Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet.
"That's why they have nick names like, CP3, PG13, and Kevin Durant hair pubes."
Kevin Durant and James Harden both had more assists in the 4th quarter against the Milwaukee Bucks than the Los Angeles Lakers in the 4th quarter tonight.   The Los Angeles Lakers not sharing the ball is very concerning.  Nets in 4.
"Eh not really. It’s not pointless since a comparison of Harden’s teammates was being made.   Like James has played with Dwight, Chris, and Russ...   But there is a night and day difference between those 3 (in their primes or not) and Kevin Durant even if all 4 are/have been all stars"
Why foul bait when you can pass to Kevin fucking Durant
"lol yea seriously. I doubt Kevin fucking Durant is pulling up from 16 feet thinking ""I'm gonna fake a foul"". That's easy money"
Kevin Durant is the best teammate 95% of any NBA player has ever had. This statement is true literally for almost everyone.
I can't wait until Chet Holmgren gets to the league  Dude makes Kevin Durant look like Kelvin Benjamin
Kevin Durant
"He’s an offensive system by himself.   Helps that MDA is there, Nets are running similar actions.   Of course, passing the ball to Kevin Durant and Joe Harris helps too.   But Harden is an savant in all aspects of offense."
Y’all really Kevin Durant get prime james harden lol
The 16-17 Rockets with a 45% Three Point shooter and Kevin fucking Durant.
At least he didn’t accidentally call him Kevin Durant again
"Because they can sign Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lebron and get a top six pick in a stacked class?"
because he's kevin durant. you know who he is. no one can guard him.
He’s Kevin Durant. You know who he is
"I dunno, this Kevin Durant kid doesn't look like he'll pan out"
They really gave James Harden Kevin fucking Durant
James Harden and Kevin Durant are on the same team. The two greatest scorers of this generation. Still doesn’t feel real   What an unbelievable duo
Force Harden to miss and he gets his own rebound and kicks it to Kevin fucking Durant.  This Nets team is scary.
They really gave Kevin Durant a prime James Harden
"Harden misses a 3, gets his own board and passes to Kevin Durant.  I feel like we’ve seen a team like this with KD before..."
"Landry Shamet is in his third season and has played with Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, and James Harden."
"It sums up how fucking crazy they can be this season in one play. Whatever Harden can't do, they have Kevin Fucking Durant to do it or vice versa."
"Harden misses a 3, gets his own rebound, passes to KEVIN DURANT for another 3"
Kevin Durant is starting to bald and that makes me feel old as fuck
This is what happens to the East when Harden teams up with Kevin fuckin Durant
Why was Pat Connaughton (probably butchered his last name) guarding Kevin Durant lmao
Which one of you flat foots let Kevin Durant and James harden be on the same team
Can someone tell me why Pat Connaughton is guarding Kevin fucking Durant?
"Where is my guy, DC legend Kevin Durant? Drive the dagger in them slim reaper."
"""Nets forward Kevin Durant"" hes getting accolades on our team and it still doesn't feel real."
Nets have Kevin durant and people hate on hardens game hard when he’s the top option
"Coming into the league, Zion, Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, and Greg Oden all had more hype than Luka."
"can't think of anyone current  Matt Barnes all time is super good  Elton Brand, Corey Maggette, Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby, Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford, Steve Francis, Penny Hardaway, David Lee, Allen Iverson, Andre Igudola, Lou Williams, Baron Davis, Monta Ellis, Stephen Jackson, Jason Richardson, Amare Stoudemire, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Jared Dudley, Gordan Dragic, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson, Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Deandre Jordan, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe, Chancey Billups, Danny Granger, Antawn Jamison, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, Demarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, David West"
"Kevin Durant has not scored less than 22 points in a game as a Net.  If he scores 25+, he will continue having a Nets franchise record for consecutive 25+ pt games.  He's played 10 games."
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
how is Kevin Durant real
Kevin Durant is the best player in the east
Kevin durant op
Kevin Durant seems like the kind of dude that pours the milk in the bowl first then adds the cereal.
"Kevin ""CP3"" Durant"
Kevin Durant is balding
Kevin Durant has reportedly invited Giannis to a “snuggle party with harden and Kyrie” apparently “ Kyrie will bring the weed and Harden will bring the wings”. Strange times in the nba
We don't even have Kyrie yet and the offense oozes potential. This is going to be a must watch team. Kevin fucking Durant is incredible.
Kevin Durant and Chris Bosh?

"Full Text for people who can't access the article:  &gt;**Houston, Seattle Feels Your Loss**  &gt;*With whipsawing trades and other player movement routine in the N.B.A. these days, it’s hard to be loyal to teams and players.*  &gt;SEATTLE — If you’re a fan of the Seattle SuperSonics, jilted long ago despite decades of loyal love, you’re seriously happy for the last great talent from your team.  &gt;That would be Kevin Durant.  &gt;After a year spent rehabilitating a torn Achilles’ tendon, Durant now seems to be living his best life in Brooklyn as the leader of the Nets. His odds of winning a third N.B.A. title received a significant boost when a blockbuster trade reunited him this week with James Harden, his close friend and former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate.  &gt;Durant, Harden and Kyrie Irving on the same team? Scintillating, so long as they end up on the same page.  &gt;But if you’re a die-hard Sonics fan — and yes, count me in that group — the happiness felt for one of basketball’s transcendent superstars comes with a flip side.  &gt;We see Durant and are forced to reckon with all the unfulfilled possibilities.  &gt;Recall that the slim, do-everything forward spent his rookie season in Seattle. He was only 19, but he led the team through a dreary and uncertain 2007-08 season. He wasn’t just good, he was prodigiously good; so full of talent and joy that watching him made the doomsday talk of the Sonics’ possible relocation drift away.  &gt;Then reality hit. April 13, 2008. The last game played at the old KeyArena: a win sealed by a Durant jump shot.  &gt;Soon the team moved to Oklahoma City, where it began anew as the Thunder. (Pardon the crankiness, but they’ll always be the Tumbleweeds to me.)  &gt;It’s been 12 years, but the stinging questions remain.  &gt;What would have happened to Durant and our team if the Sonics had never left?  &gt;And how much should fans expect their devotion to be mirrored by professional sports leagues, team ownership and the players we most admire?  &gt;I’m typical of many in Seattle. The Sonics will always be in my blood. I’m comfortably middle-aged, but I can close my eyes and remember my first N.B.A. game: the bright colors and sharp sounds and even the smells of buttered popcorn and roasted peanuts in the old coliseum nestled near the Space Needle.  &gt;I was 6, and the Sonics were playing Jerry Sloan and the Chicago Bulls. I can still feel my father’s humongous hands as he led me to our seats.  &gt;A few years later, when my parents divorced, my father kept our connection close through the Sonics. We went to dozens of games, seated almost always near the rafters. We saw Julius Erving’s first appearance in Seattle — all that grace and power and coolness.  &gt;We were there in 1978 when the Sonics lost to the Washington Bullets in the N.B.A. finals.  &gt;In 1979, we watched Gus Williams, Jack Sikma, Dennis Johnson and my dad’s friend Downtown Freddie Brown as the team won its only league championship.  &gt;Years later, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton formed a powerful, legendary duo, but our hearts were always with those 1970s teams.  &gt;One more memory, this one bittersweet. When my father was dying, far too early at age 75, we rode together in an ambulance to a nearby hospice. I held his hand again as he spoke of our most cherished times. “The Sonics,” he said. Then he recalled, one last time, the glorious, arcing accuracy of Fred Brown’s jump shot.  &gt;That’s love.  &gt;I know I’m hardly alone. We bond over teams, over remarkable wins and searing losses and athletes who remain ever young in our mind’s eye.  &gt;Fans all over the country, who root for all kinds of teams and players, know that love. It is steadfast, faithful and rooted deep into our souls.  &gt;We also know the risk. There are no guarantees that devotion will be rewarded with loyalty in return. (Just ask the Houston fans who have stood behind Harden since 2012.)  &gt;Two years after my father’s death, the Midwestern ownership group that had bought the Sonics moved Seattle’s first big-time professional sports team of the modern era to Oklahoma.  &gt;The fact that the team had been a vital part of one of America’s greatest cities for 41 years did not matter. Nor did the fact that Seattle was known to have one of the most passionate fan bases in sports.  &gt;Nothing mattered but the bottom line. The N.B.A. wanted a fancy new stadium, and taxpayer money to fund a big chunk of it. Seattle’s political leaders balked. There was no compromise.  &gt;The city lost the Sonics and the one player everyone imagined as a franchise cornerstone. The one player who could have brought another title and forged more remarkable seasons, maybe for a decade or longer.  &gt;We have never relinquished our passion for Durant. He matured during an era of constant player movement that seemed to be foretold by the uprooting of the Sonics. He came to personify the modern superstar. He bounced from team to team to team, winning an M.V.P. and world titles and never quite content in one place. But to us he’s still the wide-eyed teen who conjured our last flash of basketball brilliance. We can’t let go.  &gt;It helped that he never forgot the city that birthed his N.B.A. career. When his Golden State Warriors came to Seattle for an exhibition in 2018, he wore a vintage Shawn Kemp jersey and gave the sold-out crowd all they could ever want to hear. “I know it’s been a rough 10 years,” he said. “The N.B.A. is back in Seattle for tonight, but hopefully it is back forever soon!”  &gt;Will that ever happen? To pine for it is to be whipsawed between hope and despair.  &gt;Whenever N.B.A. commissioner Adam Silver utters a single sentence that could be divined as giving a nod toward the Sonics’ return — as he did recently when he spoke of league expansion as “Manifest Destiny” and gave a tip of the hat toward Seattle — the local news goes into overdrive with stories about a possible return.  &gt;Contractors are rebuilding the old KeyArena, soon the home of the N.H.L.’s Seattle Kraken, an expansion team. They have gutted the old structure. Close to $1 billion will go toward increasing its size and prepping it for multiple sports — pro basketball included. The whole endeavor is led by Tim and Tod Leiweke, brothers connected to the N.B.A. and Silver for decades who make no secret of their desire to have an expansion team playing in their gleaming new edifice.  &gt;Does all this mean the Sonics are coming soon? Maybe. But then again, maybe not.  &gt;So Sonics fans keep holding tight to the one last superstar to have played for our team.  &gt;He’s doing his thing in Brooklyn now.  &gt;And we’re still dreaming of the future.  &gt;I can see it now, in two years or maybe five, the SuperSonics back at long last. The first big free-agent signed to herald their return? Kevin Durant.  &gt;Sorry Brooklyn, there’s no such thing as loyalty in the N.B.A., but at least you would still have your team."
"&gt; They didn't guard him for shit, they guarded the other guys decently. if you think letting someone drop 30ppg on 60%ts is guarding them well then i don't know what to tell you.  Dude, this is Kevin fucking Durant. He’s going to score. They guarded him well.  &gt;Harden and Kyrie don't fit well with KD? did you not watch KD just score 42 points and harden have a 30 point triple double in the first game together since OKC?  I watched them win by 7 points against the Orlando Magic, who lost to the Knicks by a larger margin today.  &gt;also Kyrie is having his most efficient scoring season of his career side by side with KD. They will be fine and if they manage to stay healthy I don't see anyone stopping that offence.  Nobody is stopping that offense. Nobody was stopping the Warriors offense either, yet the Rockets were still up 3-2 before CP3’s hamstring injury."
"Oh, so you’re saying a guy who started his rookie year barely 19 years old shouldn’t immediately be thrown in the dumpster because he didn’t have a hall of fame worthy first season? Brandon Ingram would like a word. Even Kevin Durant only averaged 20 a game on 52% true shooting his first year. Meanwhile he’s now at 31/7/6. Give guys time. Oladipo and Giannis taught me to not judge a young player until like, their 5th season."
"I believe Kevin Durant to be one of the 20 best players of all time who otherwise should be in the tail end of his prime/beginning of a very effective post prime where you can still be the best player on a championship team a la 2011 Dirk and 2010 Kobe  However, I absolutely did not think he would come back from an Achilles injury looking this good. The NBA is better when he is healthy and great, I’m glad to see it."

"&gt;Since 2013 only ONE player has lead the league in scoring while outside the top-10 in touches: Kevin Durant, 2013 (44)  Why not just say ""no one since 2014?""  Also, this is the first time a non-PG has led the league in scoring since Durant in 2014 (Westbrook, Curry, and Harden)."
It’ll be interesting what their 8-9 man rotation will end up being in the playoffs. Right now it would be  PG - James Harden SG - Kyrie Irving SF - Joe Harris PF - Kevin Durant  C - DeAndre Jordan 6 - Jeff Green 7 - Bruce Brown 8 - TLC 9 - Landry Shamet  The problem at the C position is huge right now and they need someone they can rely on just as much as DeAndre Jordan. I think that’s a gap that they can fix through the buyout market decently enough. The other gap I’m not sure if they’ll be able to find a fix for is more defense.
"Casual fans don't know anyone but Michael Jordan, Kobe, Shaq and Lebron James. So they won't be the ones who are debating where guys like Kevin Durant rank in the future."

You people are making this way too complicated. First off if they aren’t a great team then they aren’t a superteam. Superteam has no meaning now. And yes kyrie irving/James harden/Kevin Durant is a great team. The nets could make no moves from here on out and I’d easily take them to win the east. It’s just not even close.

"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Bruce Brown"
"Bad take , players clearly are MVP caliber champions by the time they are 22, if you havnt made it by 22 your a bust. Only shit players don't win until they are 27 like Micheal Jordan or 26 like Lebron James, or 27 for Kevin Durant. Bunch of hanger on scrubs"
"Come on now, the guy is literally in a lawsuit right now over his involvement with bringing in Kawhi. Nobody else other than him. You don't end up in a lawsuit like that if you're ""just a consultant"". He had the same exact ""consultant"" role at the Warriors as well and still made vital decisions like picking Steph over Monta, pushing to draft Klay, pushing to draft Draymond, threatening to quit if Klay was traded for K-Love and convincing Kevin Durant to join them. You're honestly disrespecting the man trying to downplay him and put him below Masai's level. I guess that's the Raptors bias though."
Why is that the question. Let the adults talk about pre-Kevin Durant basketball.
1. LeBron 2. Joel Embiid 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis 5. Steph Curry
"Top 10 NBA players  (in order).   Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry II, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokić.  The Brooklyn Nets have 3 of the 7 best players in the NBA."
"&gt; But you know that’s what makes him “Kevin Durant” we can’t just say put him on a smaller body because if you do then he isn’t KD anymore. It is what it is.   But that's my point. He's an unstoppable scorer because he's a great scorer in a 6' 11"" frame. He's a unicorn. We've never seen someone like that."
Ehhh of course. But you know that’s what makes him “Kevin Durant” we can’t just say put him on a smaller body because if you do then he isn’t KD anymore. It is what it is. I agree though I’ll take KD over Harden. I think both are great scorers but I have never seen Harden go to another level of wanting to win a chip. Well not until now so I am really excited to see him with his new team.
He did about as well as you could expect a 6-1 dude could against Kevin Durant when he was on him but Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant.
We are the only team who passed on Kevin Durant and drafted a center. Centers are known for defense. KD = kills defense. Yes I’m drunk and have been in pain since Sam Bowie
"LeBron, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Christian Wood, Stephen Curry"
"&gt;Giannis has gone further in the playoffs than any of AD’s seasons in NOP with Jrue.   The only teams that ever beat AD's Pelicans in the playoffs were the Warriors, and I'm guessing Giannis would have lost to them too. The one time Giannis made it past the second round was against a Boston team that was falling apart due to Kyrie having quit on the team.   My point is this: if you give AD a point guard to run the offense (not even an elite PG, just a decent one) then AD can absolutely dominate in the playoffs. But even if you give Giannis shooters, it doesn't fix his inability to perform against a team that just walls off the paint. Giannis has had good shooters the last two years and in the end he was shut down because teams simply stopped him from getting to the rim.   You can neutralize Giannis, you can't neutralize AD. AD not being able to run an offense isn't a fatal flaw the way Giannis not being able to shoot is. Kevin Durant can't run an offense either, but it doesn't matter because it's not hard to just get someone else on the team to do that. You can't get someone to shoot for Giannis, just like you can't get someone to shoot for Ben Simmons. You don't have to be the main ball handler to win as a star, but you do need to be able to shoot."
A team with Kevin Durant will always be good.
"I did, it's a bunch of nonsense. It's either incorrect or arguing against popular opinions as if they're unpopular.  &gt;He cuts the rim more the Durant and Harden  Last year, Kyrie cut 0.7 times per game, which ranks 7th on his own team. He cut 0.8 times per game in '19 and 0.7 in '18 (only 3% of his possessions are cuts). On Cleveland, he averaged 0.4 cuts per game.  Kevin Durant has averaged more cuts per game than Kyrie literally every year of their careers. Every single one. He cuts two times more frequently than Kyrie  So now, he doesn't cut to the rim more than Durant and Harden. He cuts to the rim less than Durant. You are talking nonsense.   &gt;Kyrie won a three point contest for crying out loud!  lol   &gt; Why would KD and Harden intentionally try to make sure Kyrie, a guy who’s 28 and can drop an efficient 50 on any night, plays 3rd fiddle scorer every night.  Kyrie has scored 50 points or more literally 4 times in his entire career. But he can score that every night? What are you on about my man.  For reference, Harden has done it 23 times.  &gt;There’s a reason LeBron said Kyrie would be selling himself short if he didn’t win a MVP before his career was over.  And that reason is what? Kyrie is not and never was an MVP-level performer, if that's what you're implying.   &gt;My final point is, can we please stop acting like Kyrie isn’t a good 1st option for a team. This guy lead the Celtics to a 41-16 record in 2018. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum were not who they are today, you think if Kyrie’s not on that team they get such high seeding? They were 14-11 without him that year but it just gets ignored because of the playoff run.  Yeah, just an ECF playoff run. Teams who are not good do not make ECF runs and play a G7 for the Finals.   &gt;They beat the Sixers who had their first playoff birth since 2012, and the Bucks who were not nearly the team they are today, and went to 7 against a Cavs team that was brutally swept in the Finals. 2019 was a troubled year because those Celtics thought because they made it that far that they were better than Kyrie.  With Kyrie they best Indiana. And that's it, that's the only series he won as the 1st option.   &gt;Was a it underachieving season, no doubt, but you don’t have to win a championship or go to the finals every year to be called a good 1st option for a team.   What you do need to do is have an actual good performance in the postseason as the 1st option. Kyrie never had that.     &gt;People want him to fail in Brooklyn and be clearly the third option when he’s 28 and has MVP caliber talent.  He doesn't have MVP caliber talent and he never did.  &gt;Hate on him all you what off the court, but as a basketball player, he’s still a top 3 PG in the league and a top 15 player and by the end of the year he could be a top 10 player if the nets have a good year and he keeps up this efficiency.  A top15 player is not MVP-caliber, obviously. And he will not be a top10 player by the end of the year."
"IDK about that. It's more or less a derogatory term in a vacuum. I'm not even sure what a ""servant of god"" would be doing crossin' dudes over or hittin' fools with a hesi pull-up jimbo.  I can't even think (not that that's ever been my strong suit) of a good announcer call for that nickname.  ""Durant! The Servant! Cookin' somethin' SPICY in the kitchen!""  ""The Servant! Airing Hayward's dirty laundry!""  ""KEVIN DURANT! THE SERVANT! Boxin' the Warriors up and sendin' them to go!  Help me out here, man."
Chris Boucher 🤝 Kevin Durant  Being disgustingly good 3 point shooters that look like a strong breeze could snap them in half on the court
"Don't you dare call him cupcake. That term is reserved solely for the softest of the soft, Kevin Durant."
"The 2017 Cavs were the highest paid team in history (at the time). The 2018 Cavs were not Kyrie was not on the books anymore.   Miami, Cavs, and Lakers never had negative preseason odds to win the championship. The only the teams in NBA history to have negative preseason odds to win the chip were the 2017-2019 Warriors. Kevin Durant has spent his entire career playing with at least one other MVP."

The rockets didnt have an offense outside of harden for ages and it worked  Im sure adding Kevin freaking Durant will be enough lmao
"He probably would be. He had that ability within him, and he’d be going up against Kevin fucking Durant everyday in practice. Imo I think he still develops into a stud"
"They don’t have the personnel to compete? No they only have Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. Do you honestly believe what you write..? You could argue their center position is very weak with an aging DeAndre Jordan and a few rookies. Nonetheless they have great defenders otherwise with Harden and Bruce Brown as positive defensive guards. Joe Harris and Landry Shamet also help space the floor. The farthest the Sixers ever recently been was with Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick on their roster. You won’t even convince Sixers fans today that their current team is better than during that ‘18-‘19 season."
"yeah idk how this is a question. people think the box score is what matters but iverson was damn near trae young s size playing in the slowest era in NBA history.give iverson 7 years of kevin durant and I don't imagine it goes down the same way.  maybe if you send westbrook back to 97, but I'm sorry, Iverson was a more impactful player in comparison to the league he was in than Russ is to the league today."
Kevin Durant knows this all too well
"Yep. The New Jersey ""2019/20 Los Angeles Clippers"" Nets. Starring James ""Pandemic P"" Harden, Kevin ""Kawhi Leonard"" Durant, and Kyrie ""Pat Bev"" Irving."
Why do we say this? It’s Kevin Durant. Probably the only player of the last decade that has really ever been in the discussion at any point outside of LeBron ...
Shoutout to Kevin Durant being absurdly good at the game of basketball.
2 time finals mvp Kevin Durant
Except I did because it's Kevin fucking Durant.
This Kevin Durant fella may have a future in the league
Yeah Kevin Durant just averaged 32 fucking PPG
"Lol, every team this year except for maybe the Lakers have red flags, that's nothing special. The difference is is that this team has enough talent to offset those red flags.   What I saw was a doughier James Harden and Kevin Durant mesh impressively well considering the fact they have yet to practice with each other. You really can't draw any conclusions from the first game, especially considering their missing an all-nba point guard."
Kevin Durant and James Harden are the best duo in the NBA. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the second best duo in the NBA. James Harden and Kyrie Irving are the third best duo in the NBA.   The Brooklyn Nets have too much talent. Would not be surprised if they go 16-0 in the playoffs. The Brooklyn Nets are very fun to watch.
Kevin Durant is Van Gogh while Curry is Picasso
"""I'm Kevin Durant. Ya'll know who I am."""
"I never mentioned availability.  I said, people will largely decide if they want it or not.  Not when.  My remark is that Kevin Durant getting it before someone in need because his example enforces the belief others should get it... is ridiculous.   The nba getting it before other front line workers is ridiculous."
"My opinion: Not as trash as some people on /r/nba say, but also not good.  Also my opinion: That doesn't mean much though as long as they are serviceable and are able to grab some defensive pieces, because they have fucking Kevin Durant. They also have fucking James Harden. Not to mention that they also have Kyrie Irving."
"Durant is one of the greatest to ever play. The thing with Durant is that he was always known to be a student of the game with a deep respect for the players who came before him. He looked up to them. He wanted to earn their appreciation and be like them.  That changed when he joined the 73 win Warriors. Objectively, one of the most anti-competitive spineless bandwagon moves in the history of professional sports. He correctly took heat for it.  It's not even so much that he is angry at the ""old heads"" who no longer respect him. It's that Kevin Durant doesn't respect himself anymore. I genuinely believe this. I believe either consciously or subconsciously, he recognized that his decision was cowardly. He thought those titles would matter to him, but they left him feeling empty. Unearned. Not gratifying at all. He put on a show of celebration, but inside he felt ashamed. It's telling that the first opportunity he got, he jumped ship to form a superteam elsewhere, because he knew any ring he received in Golden State would feel store-bought.  His conflict isn't with the vets. It's not with the fans online he snaps back at from burner accounts. Kevin Durant's conflict is with himself. He let himself down and he's still coping with what this means for his legacy and his place amongst the greats who now look down on him."
"I get his point but lets not pretend that Kevin""I have 700 Burners on Instagram and Twitter"" Durant is one to not care about criticism"
"Kevin Durant has a point.  Based on how many ex-players suck at coaching, I don't know how much anyone should listen to them.  I think ex-players though have a lot of input on how to be a professional but actual x's and o's shit, they are very hit and miss.  The fact that they make it public is more so about making themselves sound like basketball gurus than actually providing critic.  Kobe worked out with players anonymously almost and that is completely different.  Shaq is the world's biggest hater and I wouldn't listen to him on anything.   The shit he is right on is obvious shit like Giannis needs to be surrounded by shooters.  Like DUH.  A six year old who watches basketball knows that.  Shaq wants to pretend he is this basketball guru but I can think of no better way to sink a team than make him coach."
"The next closest was Bradley Beal with .46, then Jordan Clarkson &amp; Terrance Ross tied at .45, and 5th was Kevin Durant at .44"
"But also Kevin Durant was right, Portland didn’t have a chance against GS, no matter what McCollum believed, I mean shit they swept them without Kevin Durant."
Here is an interview piece [(link) ](https://www.espn.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/7047/the-kevin-durant-conundrum) with former Mavs Advanced Metrics Guru Wayne Winston who says he wouldn’t take 2nd year Kevin Durant for free because of his poor showing in plus/minus.  Plus minus doesn’t tell you everything and rely on it too much can lead you to ridiculous conclusions. The warriors best play is to try to develop Wiseman (and other young players) so that they can contribute sooner. Warriors aren’t going anywhere this year anyways with out Klay.
"This is blown way out of proportion.  TNT execs are punching the air right now out of excitement from the free publicity LeBron James and Kevin Durant, no. 1 and 2 on the PLANET, are giving them.  Shaq does his job. And he does it well.  And you are falling for it."
"As a response to the tweet:  &gt; why are young players so sensitive when the OG Legends give them constructive criticism? When did the respect level change??  LeBron James:  &gt; There's a difference between constructive criticism and soft hating though. I've seen it both ways come my way, mostly the hate. You can hear it in their delivery.  Kevin Durant:  &gt; Them old heads need to go enjoy retirement. These boys have coaches they work with everyday lol."
“Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James and Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant”
"Because they largely aren’t the in danger.  People can decide on their own if they want it.  If they haven’t decided they want it by now, Kevin Durant getting a vaccine or Ronaldo won’t make a difference."
"kareem and shaq are not kevin durant. therefore, they are worse than kevin durant"
"I would argue Kevin Durant is probably the most disliked player in the entire league right now and he didn't bring it up... LeBron acting like he's dealt with ""mostly the hate"" when I think Durant has dealt with more seems disingenuous to me"
"Actually think it's more likely Harden guards AD he did at times in the playoffs last year. Kevin Durant and AD couldnt guard each other before the KD achilles I wouldnt want to try it now. Jeff Green on AD last year in the playoffs was no good if Green is out there rather have him on LeBron.   Think Lakers would put Schroder on Kyrie, KCP on Harden, LeBron on Durant with some Anthony Davis also."
"Of the last 30 picks, only Alonzo Mourning and Jason Kidd are Hall of Famer, with Kevin Durant who will be the Hall of Famer when he finishes his career."
"Look i want to win obviously. But saying we can’t beat Lebron and AD, or Harden and Kevin Durant, isn’t the own you think it is. We aren’t as good as they are. So for shaq to see a player grab 35/7/5 as we win our 7th straight and then just rip on him for not being a superstar comes across as really strange."
Super petty but since I got downvoted for putting out correct information here's a link to 2 separate articles that say it was 185.  https://www.sportscasting.com/kevin-durant-failed-to-bench-press-185-pounds-and-still-became-the-nbas-best-scorer/  https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/
"""Just be Kevin Durant bro"""
"I think your confusing that embiid is arguably the most valuable player but he’s not the best. He is not better than lebron James, Kevin Durant or Stephen curry to name a few. He’s been more VALUABLE this season leading his team to a top seed. There’s a difference"
"Stephen Curry comes from a long line of basketball demon slayers; Curry is the family name of a lineage of humans that cooked basketball offerings for the basketball Gods, cast down by the basketball gods for flying too close to the stars.  In response, the lineage turned to demon slaying as a way to redeem themselves before the Basketball Gods, training to shoot the ball far enough away from demons so as not to be slain by their infernal pressure.     Each member of the Curry Clan is tasked at birth with slaying a specific demon.  Steph, a particular promising Curry, was tasked with defeating the basketball demon Dribbadon, Demon-god of Handles.  It is believed that Kyrie Irving, upon activating his third eye, will summon Dribbadon into this world to kill beautiful, team first basketball and replace it with ballhogging Demon-iso play.     Curry tried to summon Dribbadon early, as a way to save Kyrie and possibly all of basketball, by defeating him in the NBA tournament of champions and keep him from activating his 3rd eye.  When Kyrie came into the league, he seemed to have no chance of getting to the Championship -- the expectation for activating his 3rd sight and summoning Dribbadon -- due to being on a terrible team with no change in sight.  Curry was taught diligence at a young age though and, despite seemingly not needing to worry about Kyrie, he still trained and prepared for needing to beat Kyrie if the time arose...and almost out of nowhere it did.    Suddenly LeBron James, Chosen champion of the Gods of Basketball, decided to return to his home -- coincidentally being where Kyrie Irving resided.  Over night the team transformed into a championship level team that rivaled anything in the NBA at the time, and -- it seemed -- Curry was not ready yet.  Except he was, by the  grace of the Gods of Basketball -- injuries to key Cleveland players -- he was.     For a year he was.  Right when it was believed the Warriors would be able to defeat the Cavs a second time and keep Kyrie's eye from activating at all -- and possibly leading to the fickle LeBron leaving his hometown yet again -- the warriors inexplicably lost a 3-1 lead for the first time in championship history.  But this was on purpose.  Curry, the clever skyfucker that he is, had reasoned that it wasn't *just* about winning.  No, Kyrie needed to win *because* of him and his demonic handles, not just as a secondary factor.  Almost in unison Curry knew that he needed to prepare and Kyrie, whether by his own design or that of Dribbadon leaking into the real world, knew that he needed to leave the good thing in Cleveland and find a way to win while being ""the man""... as only then could his 3rd eye activate.  Seeing that his power alone would not be enough, Curry set up to lose the championship game as a way to bring in Kevin Durant, a fledgling Basketball Reaper (basketball champions tasked with helping demon slayers in their tasks, often without even knowing their role in the otherworldly battle).     This lead to Kyrie ultimately leaving for the Celtics and Curry bringing KD onto his team, both sides preparing for an ultimate, final battle.  But... somehow Kyrie getting back to the championship never happened.  Not for trying -- being on stacked teams again and again -- but it just never happened.  In the meantime, Curry has been keeping his power level low, conserving energy until the day Kyrie finally reaches the championship again and possibly activates his 3rd eye, summoning Dribbadon to our world.     There have been small stirrings, people wondering if Kyrie has somehow been slowly activating his 3rd eye in other ways.  While World B. Flat seems to be the going crazy, those with links to the HoF Pantheon of basketball wonder if perhaps he is seeing the world beyond our world -- a flat endless world of black and white...Gods and demons... makes and misses.  There is a worry that perhaps there is another way to activate the demon's eye...and so Curry waits for the coming of Kyrie's 3rd eye.  Of Dribbadon.  Of his purpose.

"This is Kevin fucking Durant, not an outlier."
No they'd end up over paying Dlo because Kevin Durant or James harden or LeBron James aren't choosing to move to fucking Minneapolis.  Do you know why these dumbass owners fought tooth and nail to shorten the contract lengths? Because they were tired of getting stuck with 7 years of Vin Baker or Erick Dampier at max salaries.
Why Lebron will not win the 2021 MVP  Kevin Durant! Having probably his best offensive season since his MVP year so far and I think more voters would choose him over Lebron because of the feel good story of being able to comeback from a career threatening injury.
"Kevin Durant honestly has been the Best player in the league so far, He's averaging 30/7/6 on 66TS%, He has one of the Best Narratives as a player coming of an Achilles and still playing on this Level is rare.  A lot of people say he shouldn't win because Kyrie and Harden cancel him out but LBJ one while in Miami and Other all time greats have one with Multiple Hall of Famers on their Teams.  With the Addition of Harden I doubt KD keeps this average and efficiency up though. He's my pick to win it all"
Kevin Durant. LeBron James won’t cry about losing MVP this time because he knows Kevin Durant will win the NBA Finals this year.
"We all agree man. The problem is they don’t look like they’re set up to play 2-way, winning-basketball.  Kyrie scoring 37, KD drops 38, Harden drops a triple double and the team stilllllllll can’t beat Cleveland. That’s the problem.   Kevin Durant is a dumbass for packaging himself to Kyrie Irving in free agency. Durant, Harden, Allen, Lavert, and all those future firsts??? That’s a title team right there. Durant, Harden, no bench, and Kyrie when he decides he wants to show up??? Sorry, have fun with those division title banners cause there’s no rings on the way with Kyrie running the franchise"

It's really not that bad--much better than what it was. Kevin Durant has spoiled people to what a massive player's shooting form should look like.
**It's on the Clippers organization** to evaluate and monitor Kawhi's quad to make sure he stays healthy. That's it. We've seen what happens when a player plays thru an injury for the sake of a narrative with Kevin Durant. I don't want to see that sort of thing happen again. Tis all.
Because he's Kevin Durant
"Right. Like, if you asked someone in 2014, if Curry led his team to multiple 67+ win seasons, multiple Championships, re-invented the game of basketball, recruited Kevin Durant to the Warriors - should he be in the GOAT conversation?   Most would say ""yes, obviously"".   But Curry has a knack for doing highly extraordinary things but making them look ordinary."
Most people that watch NBA basketball are clueless. What do you expect? This Brooklyn Nets team will be better than the Kevin Durant Warriors.   People are going to hate on the Brooklyn Nets when they easily win the NBA championship.
He is playing so well and he's not even in the top 10 according to Vegas:  Player | Odds ---|--- Luka Doncic | +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo | +500 Kevin Durant | +550 LeBron James | +600 Nikola Jokic | +600 Stephen Curry | +900 Joel Embiid | +1200 Damian Lillard | +1800 Anthony Davis | +2200 Trae Young | +2500 Jayson Tatum | +3300 James Harden | +4000 Kawhi Leonard | +5000 Devin Booker | +6600 Paul George | +7500 Bradley Beal | +10000 Kyrie Irving | +10000 Zion Williamson | +12500
"Imagine having 3 all stars smh. 2 all stars in the back court + kevin durant, unfair"
Go YouTube and search Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. The Brooklyn Nets have Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Brooklyn Nets are very fun to watch. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the NBA championship."
"Media clown with a clown take. A “Yes Man” doesn’t take a step back 3 when the game is tied with less than a minute left in regulation.   James Harden wasn’t born with the clutch gene. He has Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on his team, but a “Yes Man” took that shot? Okay buddy. Kyrie Irving looked like a “Yes Man” more than James Harden when he had to inbound the ball in the last play of the first OT.  The Brooklyn Nets don’t have any “Yes Men” on their team. I’m not going to overreact to one regular season game. The Brooklyn Nets will easily win the championship."
Kevin Durant
James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
**Guys averaging 20+ppg on 65%+ TS:**        Kevin Durant - 31.3 PPG on 66.9% TS            Joel Embiid - 26.4 PPG on 66.3% TS            Nikola Jokic - 25.1 PPG on 65.8% TS                      Paul George - 24.4 PPG on 68.5% TS                    That's insane efficiency. KD in particular is pretty jaw-dropping.
Kevin Durant is a very good defender as well
"I still think it’s insane that Kevin Durant had what could have been a career-ending injury, came back and is averaging *31.3 PPG* on excellent efficiency."
"Don't know if anyone point that out but Colin Fucking Sexton outscored Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving COMBINED in the 2 OTs 22 to 19!  Moreover he made 0 turn over while the Big 3 made 2.  Cleveland have a new king, the future is bright for Sexton and the Cavs."
but then you have to worry about kevin fucking durant lol
collin sexton treated kevin durant guarding him how kevin durant would treat collin sexton guarding him what the fuck

"Villain treatment, Kyrie the disruptor, Kevin Durant the snake and Harden the quitter. The media just building up the hype for lakers and nets"
"The fact that you're likely going to get a top 4/5 ish pick in the draft after losing Kevin Durant in free agency, following 2 more rings is just amazing."
"Nets tried to acquire Collin Sexton for James Garden, Kylie Irving, and Kevin Durant, but Cavs refused."
"Imagine your 22 years old and you size up Kevin fucking Durant, dance a lil, and then drain a 3ball in his face"
"The King just got a game off of the Durant super team. Kyrie also put up some monster numbers as the number 2 scorer on his team! Kevin Love, Dellavedova, Jeff Green, Cedi Osman, and Larry Nance were there as support as well."
"Kevin Durant and James Harden played FIFTY minutes man, insanity  No way should they be risking KD for a regular season game against Cleveland"
"Where were you when Sexton singlehandedly outdueled Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden?"
Kevin Durant. James Harden. Kyrie Irving.... still not enough to stop Collin Sexton tonight.
gods save you kevin durant for now you are truly lost
Kevin Durant. James Harden. Kyrie Irving.... still not enough to stop Collin Sexton tonight.
Kyrie is good but man to not even try to get a better look with James harden and Kevin durant is nuts
Offense:  -	Steph Curry -	James Harden -	Kevin Durant -	LeBron James -	Nikola Jokic  Defense:  -	Jrue Holiday -	Kawhi Leonard -	Ben Simmons -	Giannis Antetekounmpo -	Anthony Davis/Rudy Gobert
"A hot Kevin Durant touched the ball once in the last 3 minutes of this game, WTF is Kyrie and Harden doing icing him out lmao"
Why the ball's on Kyrie? They have Kevin fucking Durant!!!!
Wtf is Kevin Durant
I was thinking the Nets should call a timeout to run a play and then I remembered they can just run an impromptu iso for... Kevin Durant.
They were perfectly willing to post up Drummond on DeAndre Jordan but won't do it on Kevin Durant.  Weird.
Kevin Durant is leading the game in rebounds
A Kevin Durant and Tauren Prince shootout was exactly how I thought this game would go
"And then another 3. Kevin Durant, god damn."
Taurean Prince making Kevin Durant shots lmaooooo

Kevin durant about to get fat and become the nets center
Kevin Durant is so 100% KD
"So on a team with James Harden and Kevin fucking Durant, Kyrie is STILL finding a way to take more shots than them on his FIRST game back??  I'm not sure I've ever seen a bigger ballhog than this guy. His ego is fucking ridiculous, really explains all of his behavior"
"""The Warriors do not have a play where Kevin Durant stands still in the corner"" was the Ethan Strauss quote, IIRC. Kerr wanted more off ball stuff from him than he wanted to do."
"Movie stars and other rich folks have been flying from LA to Florida to get their vax shots all week. They've been flying in from other places too.   - [Rich Canadians Are Flying to Florida in Private Jets to Get Vaccinated](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7andv/rich-canadians-are-flying-to-florida-in-private-jets-to-get-vaccinated)  - [Moves to stop the vaccine tourists: Florida governor Ron DeSantis demands people ‘must at least have part-time residency’ after the rich were flying in on private jets to get the jab](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9168737/Florida-governor-Ron-DeSantis-demands-people-time-residency-jab.html)  As for it being ""unseemly"" - the NBA had no qualms about [paying extra to get their guys tested, at a time when tests were in short supply.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/19/nba-players-celebrities-coronavirus-test-access/)   &gt; For 11 days, **Luke Janka, an educator from Brooklyn, went from doctor to doctor to emergency room, pleading for a coronavirus test.** As his lungs tightened and his desperation spiked, he was finally admitted to a hospital, put on oxygen and administered the test. **At the same time, the entire roster of the Brooklyn Nets was quickly tested, even though most players appeared in perfect health.** Results came back fast; four players, including star Kevin Durant, tested positive.  &gt; Actors, politicians and **athletes have had quick and easy access to coronavirus tests** while other Americans — including front-line health-care workers and those with obvious signs of infection — have been out of luck. The **nationwide shortage of coronavirus testing kits** has amplified inequities in a health-care system in which some merely call a concierge physician while others hope for attention in crowded emergency rooms.  &gt; ... On the same day that Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert fell ill in Oklahoma and was tested for the coronavirus this month, a female paramedic lay in a Tulsa hospital bed a little more than a hundred miles away, unable to obtain a test.  I don't see why the NBA cutting in line for vaccines is any worse than cutting in line for tests.  Heck, Barkley himself was on TNT saying the NBA should get vaccines first because they pay more in taxes.

He will transform from skinny KD to... KD. Brandon Ingram is Kevin Durant. Ingram is gone. There is only Kevin Durant now.
"Kevin sounds like a cool dude. Kevin, if you reading this... give us that Durant Joe Rogan podcast please."
How is Kevin Durant not the best for Maryland lol
\[Schiffer\]Kyrie Irving says Steve Nash is active tonight and will assume his assistant coaching duties of holding clipboard for James Harden and Kevin Durant.
"Media clowns only allow LeBron James to win MVP when he has superstars on his team. Kevin Durant should win MVP.  Kevin Durant is my favorite to win FMVP, but wouldn’t be surprised if James Harden or Kyrie Irving win FMVP .  Nets in 4."
The Los Angeles Lakers don’t have a player with the clutch gene. The Brooklyn Nets are fortunate to have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on their team. They were born with the clutch gene. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the most clutch players in the league.
Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet.  Nets in 4.
&gt; They can get blocked easier in limited or no space.  Unless you are curry or kevin durant
"Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant are from/raised in Maryland. Carmelo was here from 8 years old through high school and Kevin was pretty much all his life until college.  Edit I'm dumb. Born != From. Fun fact Micheal Beasley, Jeff Green, Markell Fultz, and Chase Young are from Maryland too, the same county !"
He plays like if Kevin Durant have another growth spurt in just a few months and has to adjust along with growing pains.
"Dirk was not a slow fuck... Why does everyone have to speak in hyperbole to make a point. Dirk was incredibly agile and quick for his height. There are only a handful legit seven footers in the history of the league who could move like young Dirk.  That being said, Durant now is still more mobile than young Dirk was but he is nearly 2 inches shorter and it's also Kevin fucking Durant."
Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. Get the excuses ready for LeBron James when Kevin Durant sweeps him in an NBA Finals again. That is if the Los Angeles Lakers make the Finals.
"&gt;Its entirely possible the hardest worker in the nba is Jordan mclaughlin  I would disagree and strongly at that.  Across just about every discipline, in all walks of life, it is observed that the highest achievers combine natural ability with incredibly hard work.  Among NBA players, given that they are already the elite of the elite, you will find very hard workers. It is almost impossible that the hardest worker among them would be a bench player.  It is most likely Lebron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant or one of the other greats. It is why they are who they are."
Kevin Durant
"How is Kevin Durant not from Maryland!?!? He’s Seat Pleasant’s finest. Shit I’m from MD and was born in a DC hospital, it happens a lot lol."
"As a DC native the Kevin Durant thing is a little weird because he’s technically from Seat Pleasant, Maryland but people like him and Oladipo played in tournaments in DC like at Barry Farm, but went to school and grew up in Maryland."
Explains how when he played with us he was able to play great defense on Kevin Durant (as good as can be expected anyway) one does not simply slow down KD but BI was able to. Can't do something like that without a lot of film room.
He’d benefit from whatever Kevin Durant just took this off season
&gt;District of Columbia(73 players)  &gt;All-time and Active: Kevin Durant - 27.1/7.1/4.1 (2008 - ) - Another tough decision but I went with my gut/recency bias and chose Kevin Durant.  Who the heck else is from DC that made it a tough decision??
"Don't know how you watched the Lakers double Harden and take him out of his ""role"" and can't see that value of being multifaceted. Westbrook's ""role"" is to drive to the rim, the Lakers said we are gonna wait here and make you shoot.    If a player can only do one role they are more limited than one that can do many. This is partially what makes LeBron so great. He identified that AD is a great scorer and defender but can't run an offense. So LeBron became the PG.   AD has holes in his game just like Giannis. The disadvantage Giannis has is he is playing with medium star Khris Middleton instead of an MVP type in Kevin Durant. Nobody would give him shit if he let Durant take all the shots in the clutch because they would rightfully see Giannis as great at all other aspects of the game.  How far do the Lakers go with an AD led team with Khris instead of Bron?  That's what I hate about the Ben Taylor takes. The man seem to have no understanding of team construction and salaries. AD making 10mil less than fucking WB, how exactly are the Rockets gonna win that matchup unless they go GSW and insanely outspend."
Ehhh I still like Kevin “Baby Back B****” Durant
It's crazy to me is how much warriors fans trash their own two time finals MVP in Kevin Durant to make Curry look better
Maryland's all-time and current best are both Kevin Durant.
Hope Kevin Durant don’t con him into joining his super team too!
"also have the best matchup vs the nets, PG can guard kyrie, kawhi harden, which leaves open only *checks notes * kevin durant and harris"
"So Lebron is currently the better player and [shorter](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/ymnsqnp88s7qo6mlzwzd/kevin-durant-leron-james-game-4-nba-finals-2017?fimg-ssr-default), but you want to know who would be better if they were the same height?"
"See: LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant... etc. that’s the reason you don’t have as many wins as a lot of those guys, 6th in the east is off one player and a coach who preaches defense until his guys break."

You forgot the fact that the Wizards have Russell Westbrook and the Nets have Kevin Durant. Quantum Mechanics suggest a Russ Buzzer Beater in game 7 will settle the series.
Why is the thumbnail Kevin Durant?
"wow, i didn't realize kevin durant missed all 6 games, i could have sworn he averaged 33 for the first 5 games.  ignoring the fact i was already referencing this series in my original comment, i'll just point out:  harden: 35/7/5.5 on 59.4 TS%, Game Score = 24.6  steph: 24/5/5 on 53.9 TS%, Game Score = 14.6  pretty much a landslide in harden's favor because steph was pretty bad for the first 5 games.  even in the game 6 where steph was apparently so great and harden so terrible, harden still led both teams in scoring.  the rest of the series is really bad in harden's favor with KD carrying the warriors.  it was really KD vs harden (game scores of 21.8 vs 24.6) and steph vs cp3 (14.6 vs 14.0).  even draymond actually had a higher score than steph.  definitely not the series to claim steph outplayed harden."
"&gt;This seems really interesting, but I’m not quite sure what this accomplishes that Bird Rights + removing the tax for being over the cap doesn’t  Bird Rights are transferrable, so there's no incentive for players to stay anywhere.  Nor is there any financial incentive for teams to keep them, under today's CBA. Arguably, teams are incentivized to move players around.  Right now the Warriors are 54% over the salary cap.  That would require keeping an entire starting lineup together for over a decade with the 1% discount, and there's rarely even a desire to do that.  The Nets are 51% over, despite having imported almost all of their players this season or last -- that would simply not be cap compliant.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I think the main reason I’m confused is that you start out by bringing up the OKC example, but I’m not sure how your proposal would change what happened in that situation.   It's impossible to say precisely.  No one can know how that franchise valued those players at various points -- I don't think anyone thought Harden was a potential max-salary player then.  We also don't know how much any of them valued winning versus money.  Westbrook and Harden were each making 1/3rd of Durant's salary in their final season together, and then the Thunder decided to pay Kevin Martin instead of Harden.  If nothing else, it would've made paying a new player like Martin -- instead of Harden -- less appealing.  Durant, Westbrook, and Harden would have totaled a 12% discount in 2013 which amounts to around $5M with reference to their contracts that year.  Could/would Oklahoma City have afforded an additional $5M/year in a league with more equitable competitive structure?  Who knows?"
To be honest man I don’t follow the NBA to closely so don’t take my list as a sure thing but I would say   1. Lebron James  2 Kevin Durant  3. James harden  4. Joel Embiid  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Curry ( I think he is easy too 10 he’s my favorite player some buddies of mine have said other that’s why I asked) 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Luke Doncic  9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Anthony Davis
Let me go ask him why he was injured and didn’t play!  Why didn’t Kevin Durant play game 6 in 2019 against the raptors?  Stay tuned for more dumb ass observations !
"Lol calm down dude you don’t need to get that emotional about a comment that was designed to be informative. But just for you, below is a quick list of major injuries dating back to 2015. I'm not even bothering to include every single one just because that would take too much time and this is enough to illustrate the point.   &amp;#x200B;  **2015**  * Kevin Durant foot Jones fracture * Jrue Holiday fractured tibia * Carmelo Anthony knee surgery, patellar tendon * Russell Westbrook surgery broken hand * Chris Bosh blood clots * Dwight Howard knee surgery knee edema * Derrick Rose surgery torn meniscus * Jusuf Nurkic ankle sprain, missed 37 games * Brandon Jennings achilles * Wes Matthews achilles * Julius Randle broken leg * Kemba Walker torn meniscus * Jabari Parker ACL * Paul George broken leg (olympics, missed NBA season)  &amp;#x200B;  **2016**  * Anthony Davis surgery for torn labrum and knee surgery for patellar tendon * Jrue Holiday orbital fracture, surgery * Mike Conley lower back fracture and achilles tendinitis  * Marc Gasol foot fracture, surgery * Eric Bledsoe torn meniscus * Manu Ginobli TESTICULAR SURGERY due to impact * Michael Kidd-Gilchrist shoulder surgery * Blake Griffin torn quad and broken hand * Al Jefferson torn meniscus * Jarrett Jack torn ACL * TJ Warren fracture foot * Eric Gordon surgery broken finger * Joakim Noah dislocated shoulder  &amp;#x200B;  **2017**  * [Fuck it, I'm getting tired of summarizing all this - just watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9EVSvRofOk)  &amp;#x200B;  **2018**  * Hayward broken foot * Cousins achilles * John Wall achilles * Kyrie knee surgery * OG Anunoby torn ACL * Jabari torn ACL * Porzingis torn ACL * Sefolosha torn MCL * Mike Conley left heel surgery * Jeremy Lin ruptured patellar * Dion Waiters severe ankle sprain * Roberson torn patellar * Reggie Jackson severe ankle sprain  Alright I'm stopping there, this became a tired exercise and I don't have it in me to keep going. At this point this should just be a main post."
How are the LaMelo Ball-less hornets beating Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant????  &amp;#x200B;  Those guys need so much help to win.
"&gt; Again, do you even know anything about context? Like at all? Cause all I hear is crying but nothing founded by hard evidence of big markets destroying the small markets.  Like do you even understand what the fuck my post was even about? You're off in lala land talking about shit that isn't important to the conversation. Whether or not the players moved of their own accord does. not. fucking. matter. The conversation is about whether or not it's a common occurrence for fucking small-market teams to retain their superstar players for most of their careers. And the fact of the matter is, that they don't.  None of the other shit matters in *the context* of my comment. I don't really understand why you're so bent out of shape arguing for the context of why the players left when my argument isn't about why they left, but that they leave. Ring chasing, going to your hometown, none of that matters in deciding whether or not players leave their small market teams. Can't believe you're this fucking dense to this point.  KD leaving doesn't matter because of where he went, but who he left. He left the team that drafted him, a team that was in the WCF and pushed that exact Warriors squad to 7 games. He left a small market team that drafted him, and they just had to eat it. PG demanded a trade from a team he committed to. Kawhi faked serious injury to force a trade from the team that drafted him. AD demanded a trade out of NO, the team that drafted him.   You talk about drafting well, but players don't want to fucking play for small market teams unless they're literally contending right now, are getting vastly overpaid to play there, or to jumpstart their careers in cases like Jerami Grant's. Do you think a guy like Kevin Durant or Kobe Bryant would WANT to play for the Kings? You realize Kobe LITERALLY fucking demanded the Hornets trade him because an 18 year old out of high school REFUSED to play for the Hornets? Honestly, the fact that you brought up Kobe proves how little YOU care about the context. Kobe is one of the WORST examples of this that there's been in recent memory. Literally refused the team that drafted him out of high school to force his way to a big market. You totally got me bro. I really don't know shit, but you clearly do."
... Cause NBA rosters are limited to 15 players before injuries.    If you look at the Nets roster with their hurt players they don’t have enough to run 5v5 (+subs).  If you gonna stop play instead it doesnt build cardio/endurance.    There was a point Durant was in 3v3 during the pandemic cause the whole team wasnt together.  [Link](https://netswire.usatoday.com/2020/04/27/kevin-durants-3-on-3-play-left-lasting-impression-on-nets-teammates/)  Its an availability thing.
"Steph is averaging 5.5 points more than Harden on 4.4% higher TS%. That’s a massive difference.   Harden averages 6 more assists, but that has to be written off in the contexts of their seasons as Steph gets to pass to Oubre (52.8 TS%), Wiggins (56.8 TS%), Draymond (49.8 TS%), and Wiseman (55.2 TS%) while Harden gets to pass to Kyrie (61.9 TS%), Joe Harris (67.1 TS%), Jeff Green (62.2 TS%), Bruce Brown (58.5 TS%), DeAndre Jordan (75.1 TS%), Landry Shamet (57.6 TS%), and sometimes even Kevin Durant (66.5 TS%) and Blake Griffin (62.3 TS%).  Curry has easily been the best guard in the league this year."
"Yep, Kevin Durant leaving a team that just went to the WCF is because the Thunder were bad. Paul George forcing a trade off the Thunder who he committed himself to after one year is the Thunder's fault for being a bad org, despite him knowing exactly what he was getting into when he signed with them. Kawhi bitched and moaned about the team that gave him everything he wanted and forced his way out, only to wind up in LA. That's somehow on the Spurs?  Show me how the context proves that guys don't want to leave small market teams for greener pastures. Orgs being bad doesn't change the fact that people don't want to play for them. Now, if the question was is it those guys' fault in every case, then no. But the question is whether or not big name players stick around in small-time markets when they've got opportunities at big-time markets. The answer to that question is generally no. The irony of a Lakers fan arguing this is hilarious."
"Don’t think he fits because like most fanbases hated kd when he went to golden state, but I once summarized KD’s career as such:  Kevin Durant is the Tetsuya Naito of the NBA to lebron’s Hiromu Tanahashi. Basically, we thought his impact would be “the next lebron” but it turned out his more lasting impact was saying  “fuck y’all”"
"Kevin Durant. A talented dude who ditched his team for rings. If he would have left to form his own team that would have been fine, but dude joined the most over powered team in the league for a ring.   In his MVP season he was seen as a legitimate competitor to Lebron in legacy. But just few years down the line, it is no longer even a competition."
You forgot Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard. Laker fans smh
"Yes they are. Larry Bird is top 5 all time was the best small forward of all time at the time (LeBron is now) Larry Bird is better then Kevin Durant. Magic is the greatest pointguard of all time, I'm a massive curry Stan but magic impacted winning more then curry etc etc, the team was filled with hall of fammers and multiple players In the top 20 of all time greats in there prime.   It's honestly extemtly comparable to a college player doing it against LeBron, curry, Gianni's, KD etc"
Except Kevin Durant.
"Uhh that's not what he said at all.   &gt;I was supposed to guard [Kevin Durant]. We match up well size wise. KD’s out. The next person I’m guarding is Kyrie [Irving]. Like, who’s doing that? It’s not many players who are doing that. And to be doing it at a high level like that? I don’t think there’s anybody else really doing that. I mean, Kawhi [Leonard] when he was really playing defense like that, of course. But, it’s not too many guys.  Interviewer: Didn’t Kyrie have, like, 37 last night though?  &gt; Yeah, but we won. His plus/minus was negative, too [it was -13]."
guard? yes. Even I could guard Kevin Durant if given the chance.   shut him down? no.
"When did he say it wasn’t fair to judge how Kyrie did against him? I didn’t see that.  Yes, he can likely guard KD as well as anybody, but it’s Kevin Durant. No one’s shutting him down, and I don’t think Simmons would claim to."
No one can guard Kevin Durant
"&gt; I was supposed to guard [Kevin Durant]. We match up well size wise. KD’s out. The next person I’m guarding is Kyrie [Irving]. Like, who’s doing that?  Simmons really acts like he's the only good wing defender in the league."
"James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant still play for the Thunder? Lebron still play for the Cavs? Is Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Kawhi on the Spurs? Paul George on the Pacers, or the Thunder whom he promised to stay for but demanded a trade after 1 year? Hell, Kyrie even forced himself out of Cleveland wanting to be 'the guy' then forced himself out of Boston where he was the guy to go be 3rd fiddle to KD and Harden. I guess they all just proved you wrong.  Giannis is an outlier, and you're trying to paint the picture of the outlier being the norm. Knock it the fuck off, it's embarrassing."
Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson. How do you stop that? Which fusion would be best to face this monster?
Kevin Durant and Tony Allen
Kevin Durant offense and Tony Allen defense
"Nah, you just don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re a fool if you think Anthony Davis is on the same level as Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant as a scorer."
"It's pretty easy to recognise this.   Golden State with Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are an unstoppable juggernaut.   The Lakers without LeBron and Anthony Davis would not even sniff the playoffs.   You add the right two players to the worst team in the NBA and they're championship level.  Unless you're proposing an achievable pair of additions that will transform the team, then the statement is basically meaningless."
"Hakeem was like a generational talent. And Portland was stupid and passed because they had Drexler.  Portland also passed on Kevin Durant for Greg Oden, but that was kinda justified as Oden was like a man among boys he just was always hurt"
"Kevin Durant and every Twitter troll. Just have him sit on a folding chair in some empty Warehouse. Concrete floors, busted windows, line of people out the door and around the block just ready to talk shit."
"Why are you only looking at blazers vs warriors lmfao, talk about changing the subject. I thought this was about Curry vs Dame as individual players?   If you want to bring their teams into it, I wonder who’s team would be better— Dame alongside Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.. and Curry alongside CJ, Melo, and Nurkic who is injured more often than not 🤔. I think we all know the answer"
Is this Kevin Durant?
Because he had Kevin Durant and then James Harden to cover for his historically inefficient production.
"this. Prime LMA played very similarly to 2011-2016 offensively. A 18-23 PPG scorer with an incredible midrange game, underrated passer and a reliable spot up 3PT threat (Dirk was elite, LMA rather average). Rebounding is also pretty similar, both are good defensive rebounders, but played so far from the basket they were never great offensive rebounders.   LMA was a better defender than '11-16 Dirk. Prime Dirk is like a more iso-heavy Kevin Durant, or a better Porziņģis, especially now that Porziņģis has developed his turnaround/low post/mid range game more."
"Nah, Kevin Durant pulled the weakest move in the history of professional sports."
Kevin “McNulty” Durant
"Probably Buck Williams, Derrick Coleman, Kenyon Martin, Kris Humphries, Kevin Durant, order of those 5 TBD. Thaddeus Young and Jason Collins when Nenad Krstic played center are honorable mentions"
The idea that supporting players sitting out from games for no reason is the same as supporting labor in some sort of Marxist corollary is such a scam. Players are not the proletariat. Venture capitalist Kevin Durant is the bourgeoisie. These guys are landlords. They’re bosses. Foh telling me it’s anti-worker to say these rich fuckin dweebs should be playing their whole contract out for the fans.
"I was here for the first time this was posted  Bol Bol is fine but I feel like he's a pretty low IQ player, every time he gets the ball he's trying to do his best Kevin Durant impression"
"Yes, this will surely be the motivation for Kevin Durant to finally score 30 points for the first time in his career"
Kevin “Mcnulty” Durant  “The fuck did i do?”
"Only thing he was carrying was the extra weight lol, but yes he'll have Kevin Durant and Kyrie to cover up for his big game flames out if they themselves are in their right mind, that is true"
"Yeah his overall play and stats are really good but when his team needs him the very most I'm not trusting him, 2015 his team comes back from 3-1 in spite of him, 2017 game 6, even 2018 of course Chris Paul got hurt but 27 missed 3s in a row in game 7? And I understand that was a team thing but a better leader would have done better, 2019 the reverse happens Kevin Durant goes down and they still lose the next two games even though Steph Curry spotted them 0 points in the first half, and then game 4 in the bubble last year against the Lakers , y'all trust that guy if you want to I ain't doing it 😂"
"Fuming is an overstatement. Paraphrasing, she said, ""you can say a lot of things about Kevin Durant, but he can play basketball"""
Interesting coincidence is that Kevin Durant was the all-star with the least games played that year (broken foot I believe). He might end up being the all-star with the least games played this year as well.  Off the top of my head other major injuries that year to stars were Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony.
My biggest fear in life is that Kevin Durant gets no pussy. The thought alone shakes me to my core.
"You watched this game and came out feeling that Embiid alone is enough to win a series against Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin fucking Durant?"
"""*KD sucks! KD sucks!*"" - Sixers Fans  ""*What I do? I'm not even playing...*"" - Kevin Durant"
🙄  Kevin Durant is insecure big guy. What else needs to be said? Literally no one with more than rocks for brains disputes it.
Yes it's very worrisome that there's a team with Kevin Durant and James Harden and Kyrie Irving on it. Thank you for asking.
"Yes, I am too? Why would you think I wasn't?  Did you miss when the basketball player Kevin Durant, the basketball player Kyrie Irving and the basketball player James Harden, as well as the basketball players LaMarcus Aldridge and Blake Griffin all chose to sign with the basketball team in Brooklyn, a Burrough if New York City, the Brooklyn Nets?"
Kyrie is better than harden and Kevin durant at scoring. Kyrie can score with different and several ways.
Kevin Durant shouldn’t be quitting on his team
"“Well he used to, but he stopped coming in because he was afraid he would run into Kevin Durant here after their crazy Twitter beef. Anyways, enjoy your workout Mr. Kurant.”"
"He probably would've been first team in 2013-2014 if voters didn't prefer to put 1 point guard and 1 shooting guard; especially at that time.

Plot twist : OP is Kevin Durant
"The fact you don't think playoff defenses chose to scheme for Curry over Durant because they're more scared of Curry's shooting shows you know nothing about basketball.  &gt; 3 different teams (cavs, 2018 clippers 1st rd, 2019 raptors) have shown focusing your defense on Curry (through swarming defense/traps/box and1s/triangle and2s) is enough to slow him down  Lol you focus anyone and you slow them down. The amazing thing about Curry is that he doesn't need to score to have the biggest effect of the game. Gravity is such a simple concept and people like you still don't understand it.  &gt; The fact you think teams would prefer a 100% Kevin Durant dunk over a 45% Curry 3 is just laughable to me.  They literally did dummy https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/6/1/15727644/warriors-wide-open-dunks-cavaliers-shooters-strategy"
Heaven forbid Kevin durant finds out he’s being called a keyboard warrior by the internet message boards
Kevin Durant is weird
I know I'm getting old but I'm younger than Kevin Durant and I have zero idea what he's saying. It doesn't even look like English to me. Can someone translate this tweet into English please?
All of Reddit aside from you is Kevin Durant.
"Literally me, Kevin Durant"
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
Kevin Durant has been caught red handed defending his jumping to the warriors under a burner account. He kind of shit in the thunder outside of Russ. It was not a good look.
"i dunno, man.  dude seems to be doin' pretty well [at investing his money](https://www.talkbasket.net/126125-kevin-durant-invested-in-coinbase-when-it-was-valued-at-1-6b-its-expected-to-hit-an-over-100b-valuation).  granted, it may be through a business manager, but it seems like he's at least got a few other things to do other that tweet and hoop."

"I imagine you're maybe half joking but Philly has a top 2 defense with a DPOY candidate and Bucks are top 10 with the last DPOY winner. A second MVP player is a great add but it ain't gonna crack open the case so easily lol   Plus, going back to my first point James harden and Kevin Durant have played a total of 9 games this season together, out of a total 41 spent as teammates."
"Zach Lavine. Don't get me wrong, he is a great player. But looking at his stats, you would think he is Kevin Durant or Michael Jordan."
Gotta load manage Kevin Durant who's been load managing all fucking year.  Dude really can't even play 20 minutes on a back to back?  What's the point of rehab if he's not at full strength?

They really used Kevin Durant to beat the KAT-less Wolves instead of the team they're competing with for the 1 seed
But would winning a ring or two with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving add that much to his all-time ranking?
How would that disqualify wade? He won his first ring without a superteam. Hardens only ring is gonna be with Kevin Durant and kyrie irving. Harden bitched out he had a good squad in Houston before he forced a trade for Westbrick and then golden state broke up. They’d be underdogs vs the lakers but not horrible underdogs.
"Give me Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden"
With Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving? Harden looks like a bit of a fool now with how cp3 has held up. He couldn’t man up and get his shit together and stick it out with cp3 and instead forced a trade for westbrick and then dipped and went to create a superteam. Cp3 was willing to stick it out with harden and now has led okc to the playoffs and is helping lead Phx to a 2 seed.
"James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving"
"So if we're saying they have to be superstars at the same time (it's all in one season), none of Barkley/Pippen/Hakeem were superstars when they teamed up.   Amare was the 2nd best player on a 60 win team.  Kyrie was the 2nd best player on a finals winner (Cavs).   And I know Amare and DeAndre aren't equal, which is why using all nba first team as a starting point is flawed, it ignores all context that some years deserving players get snubbed. Also it's easier for big men to make it some years cause of the C spot. If we say you have to be All NBA or MVP in a given year to be a superstar, that means in the 2018-2019 season Kevin Durant wasn't a superstar (he also finished 8th in MVP voting so misses on that criteria) . So right off the bat if we're using first all nba/MVP as the starting point, we cut off KD when everyone knows KD is a superstar."
"Ant and A-rod aside, this is a bigger issue than it seems.  Baseball's marketing is failing its players and its league.  There's no reason someone shouldn't know A-rod.  As I'm undoubtedly sure non-NBA fans know Lebron, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and maybe Kawhi."

"Now, Shaq. Perhaps the most risky part of this team, he makes or breaks it. If he doesn't get along with the team, I'd just replace him with Hakeem or Kareem. But, if he DOES get along, what he offers can't be matched. With Curry like gravity, he's going to be essentially unstoppable. Players like Shaq and MJ are the reason this team has so many passers and floor stretchers. The less Klay has the ball while still stretching the floor, the greater Shaq will be. Imagine a lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Durant/Shaq. 4 out, 1 in, feasting. It'd be so damn nuts. He can rebound, defend and protect the rim, and is perhaps the most reliable and consistent bucket getter on the team. Pass to him and you have a 70% chance of 2 points. If he gets tripled, you have Bird or Klay ready to shoot. And if they are guarded, you probably have a high IQ player like Lebron ready to warp the defense to exploit the triple team, resulting in the most efficient shot. See Shaqs upside? All of that was possible thanks to him simply being, him.   Now, you might see Garnett and be confused. He seems REALLY out of place, doesn't he? You usually have someone like Duncan there. Well, for you, I'd recommend Thinking Basketballs Kevin Garnett: Greatest Peaks video. It is EXTREMELY useful in telling you how good he was. He was a 7 footer with the agility of a guard, yet he had perhaps the greatest fire and spirit out of anyone he played against. As you might have noticed, all of my players have either elite passing or elite bbiq, with exceptions for ridiculous players like Shaq. Garnett easily has that BBIQ. His help defense is absolutely insane, seemingly knowing what the enemy will do before they do, and arriving to obliterate shots as soon as the ball leaves the enemies hands, sometimes before. His positional and court awareness allowed him to prey on mismatches, read schemes and outrebound ANYONE. This help defense and rim protection is crucial for this team, because without him, the team softens up on team defense. He is ABSOLUTELY crucial for the team and I'd urge you to not underestimate him. With so many faces on the team who want the ball, Garnett won't be someone who holds the ball often, probably only for spot up shots and for some smart passes here and there. High BBIQ, remember? Garnett will be focusing his energy on rebounding, 1 on 1 defense and team defense.  Then, we have Duncan. You know, I made this comment because I realized I completely forgot to talk about him. That says alot about his style. Quiet, not flashy, but he gets the job done. He, like Garnett will focus on defense, any kind of defense. I trust him to get the job done. He's the little thing king. So much of what he does doesn't appear on the stat sheet. If this team ever happened, and they played a game, you'd probably look at the box score and think ""Huh, Duncan, meh performance... Disappointing..."" You wouldn't see the leadership and selflessness he displayed when the team was down 17, inspiring the team. You wouldn't see the rim protection, the pass leading to a pass, or the team play. In fact, I don't think he cares about those stats. For another video, I'd reccomend Thinking Basketballs Tim Duncan video or Clayton Crowleys video on Duncan. As I said before, I value BBIQ and passing, and with Duncan playing for Pop for 15 years, he certainly has those attributes. With so many superstars, it's nice to have a consistent guy like Duncan who can't really be gameplanned against that much.  Then, the last 2 are KD and Green. I was SO close to adding Pippen but removed him at the last second for KD. KD's main purpose will be stretching the floor and getting buckets in a consistent and reliable way, similar to Shaq. Draymonds main purpose would be providing the intangibles of spirit and fire, and acting as a ball handler. If Lebrons on the bench and Magic or Bird have been gameplanned against somehow, you have Draymond to fill that spot as the facilitator. He can't exactly shoot but in this lineup, you can play him smallball center or play Garnett at C to make up for it. Jordan/Steph/Klay/Dray/Garnett could be an unpredictable lineup but Jordan at 1 works. This team is just completely unstoppable. Running Lebron + 3nD? I'll go Magic/Jordan/Bird/Duncan/Shaq and feast on your vulnerable interior. Running an old school lineup? I'll go Steph/Klay/Bird/KD/Dray and burn you."
"(Copy and Pasted)  ***Starters:***  ***PG:*** 2021 Steph Curry  ***SG:*** 1991 Michael Jordan  ***SF:*** 2018 Lebron James  ***PF:*** 2004 Kevin Garnett  ***C:*** 1964 Bill Russell  ***Bench:***  ***PG:*** 1987 Magic Johnson  ***SG:*** 2016 Klay Thompson  ***SF:*** 1986 Larry Bird  ***PF:*** 2003 Tim Duncan  ***C:*** 2001 Shaq  ***2 Reserves:***  2017 Kevin Durant, and 2016 Draymond Green.  ***Coaches***  Gregg Popovich (HC)   Phill Jackson (Assistant)  Alright, so I'll explain. First off, that starting lineup will probably be the most used line up, BUT the bench lineup will NOT be used like that all the time. You might be looking at it and thinking that there isn't enough movement, or shooting, or whatever, but we won't be strictly using that bench ever. Players on that bench will be slotted into specific lineups depending on whos hot or the opponents lineup.  As for the starters, I really like this lineup. The thing with it is, EVERY single player there is a) Elite in passing b) Elite in BBIQ and c) Offers something needed. You have Steph who is always going to be in these lineups, because he offers so much. He barely needs the ball. He has the most gravity of any player bar Shaq and he uses that gravity by stretching the defense into knots to exploit openings and defensive breakdowns. Who do we have to exploit those breakdowns? 4/5 of the team is elite at offense and shooting. People hate on Garnett for not having high volume but that helps here as his efficiency is going to be sorely needed. Steph will be able to facilitate or pass to the facilitator, and because this whole team has great IQ, they can consistently make the most of Steph by tracking his off ball movement to relocate to him or get the open man. Stephs ridiculous shooting is just so reliable. He's also super clutch and is able to act as an ok team defender. It's super obvious he HAS to be here. Able to make circus layups or logo shots, he makes any lineup a threat from 3 BY HIMSELF. (By the way, I chose 2021 Steph as I believe he is at his peak right now. He can handle more contact, can carry better, has higher BBIQ, is stronger and is tougher mentally, all the while arguably shooting better. His only loss is a SLIGHTLY slower first step.)  You have 2018 Lebron who I chose because while people love 2013, his 2018 was just more complete and dominant imo. He can shoot and dial in defensively when needed. With so much talent on this team, Lebron can focus on one specific attribute. If he's in a playmaking/offense filled lineup, we know he's athletic enough to be elite defensively, and he has the help in order to focus on that part of his game. He's acting as a jack of all trades in a way. His main purpose in the majority of his usage will be playmaking though. You got an opening? I have no fear in passing to Lebron because he WILL make the right play. Whether that's a Russell lob or a relocated Steph 3, or a Jordan midrange, or his own shot, I trust him to be the primary ballhandler. Him in 2018 was able to do this best. Just control the game. Lebron can handle any assignment defensively when dialed in, but to conserve his energy, the team he's around will probably be elite defensively. This lets him focus on warping the match with his BBIQ. He acts as the glue of the team in a way.  Then you have Jordan. When it comes down to the clutch, he will ALWAYS be in the lineup. Game on the line, he gets the ball. If we need a 3, Steph gets the ball. You have 2 clutch players and the greatest scorer of all time, Jordan really completes the team. He can pass at an elite level and shoot anywhere, (ideally not the 3, but jesus, look at the team. No way in hell he's the one getting the ball at the 3 line when you have such a good coaching staff, so many high IQ players, so many great passers and so many elite shooters. A non issue.) He is GOING to be the leader of the team. There's a reason I didn't choose Kobe or Wilt. Everyone on this team I believe can live with MJ being the leader, bar potentially Shaq. He might be the biggest risk but he also has the biggest upside, we'll talk about that later. Being able to have the goat scorer on your team who is ALSO the goat in clutch means we have a guy in bailout situations. Just pass it to MJ and he'll make something. He can also work as a 1 since he is an elite passer and has high BBIQ. He rebounds excellently and he can use his athleticism to get anywhere on the court. With any elite facilitator, (We have SO many on the team) that's lethal. He can just fly up and dunk whenever he wants, or rise for a jumpshot. He's going to be the centerpiece of any offense he's in, only ever splitting the cake with Shaq.  Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass and offer a new vitality to the team.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense."

"I can't say that I'm familiar enough with those other players' regular season and playoff numbers off the top of my head, so I'm not going to say you're wrong there.  I'm not sure why people point to the point guard injuries in 2015 so much.   Jrue played 3 out of 4 games, even if he wasn't 100%. Conley played 5 out of 6 games. Beverley was out the whole series, but he didn't slow Steph down whatsoever in the regular season (I'll admit it was only a 2 game sample size, though).  And Steph didn't get outplayed by Kyrie in game 1. I'd say they were very even. Steph shot better, scored more, and assisted more while Kyrie had fewer turnovers, more steals, and more rebounds.   Either way, healthy teams win championships. The healthier teams won in 2020, 2019, 2016, and 2015, for example.  And for all the talk about those point guards in 2015, nobody ever mentions the injury that could've had the biggest impact on the Western Conference playoffs: Kevin Durant. If he was healthy, I'm sure he would've made things tougher for the Warriors than Jrue, Conley, or Beverley would have.  As bad as Steph was in game 2, he still hit the shot to send that game to OT.  I agree about game 3 for the most part, but he hit a shot with 28 seconds left to make it a 4 point game and another shot with 19 seconds left to make it a 3 point game. He brought that game back within reach, but the Cavs hit their free throws.  Iguodala was phenomenal that series (other than his free throw shooting), so I won't take anything away from him. They wouldn't have won without him.  But teams that win game 5 of a series tied 2-2 go on to win the series 84% of the time, and Steph put up 37 in that game."
I find Kevin Durant to be shallow and pedantic
"Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Miami and Brooklyn are better than the Celtics. I trust Giannis, Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant more than Jason Tatum. The only favorable matchups are Atlanta and New York for Boston. At the best, he's between the fifth to tenth best player in the NBA Eastern Conference. Boston faces any of them I previously mentioned, and they'll be out in the first round."
"Lol your point doesn't make much sense, we're comparing rookies to rookies.

Kevin Durant. Polarizing figure among nba fans but his game undoubtedly embodies skill and finesse. Also love watching Dr J highlights cause his dunks make him seem like a ballerina with a ball.
he's limited with other ball dominant stars?  like say iso guys like kyrie irving and kevin durant?  pretty sure the nets had the best offense in history while they were playing.
"oh i agree. one plays with guys like lebron james, kevin durant, james harden, etc. the other.. doesnt.  trapping kyrie in those cases just doesnt make sense."
"Remember when everyone meme’d the Knicks for picking up Julius Randle?   Mind you it was not Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irvin, but seeing this feel good story is such an amazing thing for the franchise finally."
"If Kevin Durant had gone to New York and put them in 4th place with the same stats, the media would be calling him an MVP candidate."

"&gt; Carmelo Anthony is a better pure scorer than Kevin Durant  Oh shit. I did it, boys.  I found the biggest idiot on r/nba."
Kevin Durant.
Carmelo Anthony is a better pure scorer than Kevin Durant
Nope. Kevin Durant is a great scorer. Carmelo just chucked away even though he was above average effiency wise (although still not amazing). Part of what makes a great scorer is knowing when to defer like KD did. Carmelo NEVER deferred. Dude just chucked away all while being a black hole on defense and never sharing the ball.
"GSW players communicated with KD all season about how much they needed him:  &gt;""Here's the thing that's interesting about Golden State -- their players have been recruiting Kevin Durant all year. And it goes back to early in the season when the Thunder were struggling. And I don't know if Golden State saw them as a peer; I don't know that they saw them as a threat ...  &gt;Kevin Durant, just like he was hearing from guys in Boston, Washington, different places -- he was hearing from guys on the Warriors about, 'Hey, you can come help take the pressure off of Steph Curry. We need you.' This is when they were running off win after win after win.  Andre Drummond later said publicly that they wanted KD so *they didn't have to play against him*."
"Kevin Durant is a soft skin bitch.  Maybe if his ass would lift some weights, he would stop being a bitch.  Also, hi KD, big fan, stop being a soft ass bitch. You're worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Quit searching for your name on twitter. In fact, delete twitter. Soft ass bitch."
Are we sure this isn't a Kevin Durant alt?
The social media era has not been kind to Kevin Durant.
What about Kevin Durant who perpetually feels the need to argue with trolls on twitter?
Kevin Durant forgot to switch twitter accounts and liked a tweet that saying that he was better than Steph while they were teammates and that Steph “needed another MVP teammate to get the job done”  &gt; Kevin Durant was better than Steph curry both those years😂😂😂😂 everybody knows it bro. don’t try and kid urself. This mf curry needed another MVP and 3 all stars to get the job done💀💀💀💀 trash ass   the tweet in question: https://twitter.com/sleiman_jp/status/1384669928330907661?s=21  Screen recording to prove the tweet is not photoshopped: https://streamable.com/sc55f7   Very authentic😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
"“Kevin Durant”, Dumbledore asked calmly    I just realized KD is just the type of person to sneak his name into the Goblet of Fire 😂"
"For such an exceptional basketball player, Kevin Durant seems to be mightily insecure about his basketball."
If you type Kevin Durant 3 times it summons him
"There's not a way to specifically filter out for the last go-ahead shot so it's possible some of these got 2 in the same game  but here's the list of **most go-ahead shots made in the final 24 seconds of the 4th quarter or OT on a team that won the game since 1996-97, regular season and playoffs combined**  |Player|FG| |:-|-:| |Kobe Bryant|30| |LeBron James|29| |Carmelo Anthony|28| |Vince Carter|23| |Dirk Nowitzki|22| |Kevin Durant|20| |Joe Johnson|19| |Paul Pierce|19| |Ray Allen|19| |Chris Paul|18| |Dwyane Wade|18|  [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/tiny/ygbRx) Generated 4/21/2021.

Kevin Durant is a punk  He seems lacking in self awareness too as a ring chaser
"So...I don't really follow NBA. Is Kevin Durant some kinda weird manbaby on social media? A few weeks ago I saw the Mike Rappaport (btw fuck that dude, total annoying toolbag who deserves whatever he gets for deliberately trolling folks as a grown ass man) and now this...  Seems a bit odd for someone as accomplished as KD is to be spending his time picking fights or gaming social media posts. Is this unusual in the sport or does this kinda thing happen often?"
"&gt; KD is actually a weird guy and not in any sort of good way lol  Eh KD is a headcase for sure, but he doesn't get into fights _(outside of social media)_ and [has given a lot to charity](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/05/21/kevin-durant-one-million-dollars-oklahoma-tornado-thunder). He's got an eternal chip on his shoulder for always being behind LeBron."
Kevin Durant would still have 0 titles if not for Curry
Summon him:  Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant.
"But he's not leading the team like Wade led the Heat. In any given playoff series Kevin Durant can easily be their best most important player, and probably will be for at least one of their series this season. Kevin Durant and Harden are absolutely a 1a/1b thing for the Nets. Winning a championship and FMVP as barely the best player on your team is a far stretch away from winning an FMVP as the clear cut, sole MVP caliber player on your team."
kevin durant couldnt get the job done with 3 all stars in OKC either. hes the one that needed help 😂💀
How many here are kevin durant.
"If this is happening like this, there must be dozens or hundreds of people who have gotten into internet fights about kevin durant...and instead of some neck beard it was actually kevin durant lol.  I bet this dude has so many burners he prob hypes the guy arguing for his greatness with other burners."
Fuck Kevin Durant. You are a top athlete in the world and you choose to spend time on Twitter reading from dudes with Bobby Schmurda as their header profile pic. GET THE FUCK OFF TWITTER
"Kevin Durant is kind of a douche. Great player, also arrogant douche"
"Lulz seriously who gives a shit if people post about this? This is reddit. It's not that serious. If people want to talk about Kevin Durant being a sensitive little bitch, they have that right."
&gt; **Kevin Durant forgot to switch twitter accounts**   Are we sure?
Kevin “EZ-Road” Durant
"It seems like ""This player"" you're talking about is always Kevin Durant"
"Kevin Durant tomorrow. ""I was hacked"""
Kevin Durant is very insecure and his defenders are even bigger clowns.
He did the same thing when liking a tweet hating on Westbrook lol  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/4/23/17272808/kevin-durant-instagram-russell-westbrook-like-twitter-burner-account-nba
"To be fair, if you're Kevin Durant, you could be both."
"Kevin Durant is so insecure and unlikable. He pulled the softest move in history and continues to double down on it.   He made a decision he clearly couldn't deal with the ramifications of. He's been pissed about it ever since he beat LeBron the first time and didn't get the reaction LeBron got after his first ring.   He's a career bridesmaid. The hot, but super annoying girl of the group that always complains, sleeps around for attention, and then wonders why no guy wants to date her.   He'll never be as loved as Steph or LeBron globally. He's left over and over again, so he'll never be locally loved either. No one thinks he tough. He's going to retire with a couple of rings, a bunch of burned bridges, and be remember for his antics despite being one of the most talented scorers and formerly most loved players ever."
Can we all stop relying on an MVP talk written for him by a Christian pastor sex offender he was friends with 10 years ago and all just all start talking about the fact that Kevin Durant is a piece of shit and a stain on the NBA?
I've always thought that Kevin Durant needed the red pill for a really long time.  Like seriously I just can't believe somebody like him gives a shit what anybody thinks.  I'm a nobody and I don't give a flying fuck
 Kevin Durant AlWAYS carring my dream/
"Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Chris Paul. It seems like great players are always coming and going."

"&gt; Kevin Durant was better than Steph curry both those years😂😂😂😂 everybody knows it bro. don’t try and kid urself. This mf curry needed another MVP and 3 all stars to get the job done  You could literally say the same thing about KD needing the 73 win warriors to ""get it done"".  What a trash take."
He’s Kevin Durant. we know who he is
I enjoy watching Kevin Durant play and I’m not a hater but does anyone know anything about his personal life? Does he have a gf or wife? What does he do outside of basketball?
Kevin Durant to raymondqadev: stay right where you are
"They'd be playing with no passing on the floor whenever Kyrie sits. You can make that work in a pinch with Kevin Durant out there, but you need to be a complete team to actually get deep into the playoffs. That offense would be very prone to stagnation"
"Then you have Russell. A lotta people start Shaq, or have Duncan at C, or have Kareem, or have Wilt. I chose Russell because in a team like this, perhaps the most valuable ability is not requiring the ball so much and being able to pass. You already know his purpose. Provide intangibles like leadership and heart, dominate the rim, pass at an elite level, catch lobs, be a defensive beast. There isn't so much to talk about in his role, but that's precisely why I chose him. I don't want a ball dominant guy to dribble the clock for 20 seconds and throw up some fadeaway. I need my center to anchor a defense, protect the rim, switch and pass. Russell does all of that in spades, as the GOAT defender. Russell's ability to both floor and ceiling raise is the reason he had the most successful dynasty of all time. Do you think it's a coincidence Russell, a defense focused player with minimal offense led the greatest defensive dynasty of all time with minimal offense? Those Celtics teams were Russell, through and through. His attributes such as defense was the reason they were so successful. Speaking of defense.....  What you might have noticed is the balance of the team. 4/5 of this team is elite defensively, 4/5 of this team can shoot reliably, 4/5 of this team is elite offensively in general, 4/5 of this team has elite BBIQ, 4/5 of this team has ridiculous athleticism, 4/5 of this team can rebound great and 5/5 of this team can pass the ball. There won't be a confliction because everybody here can congeal and work as a team. MJ/Kobe/Harden/Wilt/Dirk might seem like a cool team but in reality it won't fit together. This team has essentially no weaknesses. For every Kevin Garnett offensive rebound, there will be a Steph dragging 2 defenders across the field leaving Jordan open for half a second. For every miss, there will be a Russell rebounding to Lebron to pass to the relocated Steph or layup by Russell. For every Bill Russell blocked shot, there will be a clutch MJ basket saving the game. The team works really nicely.  Next, the bench. Now, the bench isn't a lineup but it's players who will be played in certain lineups. Instantly, you have the king of facilitation, Magic. Showtime can slot into any non Lebron lineup as the main ballhandler and will be the engine of that lineup. As they conflict so much, I decided to not have them be on the same starting team. Having Lebron and Magic share the court might seem like the no brainer choice to many, but you soon realize how ineffective it would be. Lebron is going to be the ballhandler of any lineup he's in which leaves breadcrumbs for Magic. Having Magic as the bench player essentially assures the bench of leadership and flow, making sure his team has better synergy than the opposition. It's not like it's in his character to oppose it either, as he was willing to play second fiddle to Kareem for a few years. Magic with his height is able to shake things up in a way Steph can't as the backup PG. He can post up or pass from anywhere, and is similar to Lebron where his uncanny court vision assures you that he will make the right choice. His ridiculous build and height can offer a new vitality to the team which is super useful.  Then you have Klay Thompson. Personally, I can't believe this guy isn't on all time lineups more. He's so perfect for this kind of team. With so many faces who need the ball, you WANT a guy who doesn't even dribble, who shoots at an all time level after catching and goes right back to hunting his defensive assignment. He can pass, won't conflict with egos and stretch the floor when a certain lineup needs it. As a cherry on top, he can guard any guard or wing and do a damn good job.  Then you have Bird. I was originally going to have Durant there but I changed my mind. He's the 2nd clutchest player ever, so having him in non-MJ scenarios would be preferred, it would take some creative lineups to fulfill his potential. Able to stretch the floor like Steph and pass like Lebron, he has elite court vision and can be a leader at any time. His incredible array of moves means he is another player that can get you a bucket when needed. He's essentially ambidextrous to make up for his lack of athleticism and has a fantastic ability to manipulate defenses to free up opportunities to score and especially playmake. Against tougher defenses Birds offensive role inside will be minimized since it doesn't suit him, so Pop and Phill would play to his other skills like passing. Yet another guy who can pass the ball well, noticing a pattern? He will need the ball a bit so having so many passers on this team is great. A lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Duncan/Shaq might be a killer when you need offense.  Then, we have Duncan. You know, he's the last person I talked about and I had to add him in at the end because I forgot about him. That says alot about his style. Quiet, not flashy, but he gets the job done. He, like Garnett will focus on defense, any kind of defense. I trust him to get the job done. He's the little thing king. So much of what he does doesn't appear on the stat sheet. If this team ever happened, and they played a game, you'd probably look at the box score and think ""Huh, Duncan, meh performance... Disappointing..."" You wouldn't see the leadership and selflessness he displayed when the team was down 17, inspiring the team. You wouldn't see the rim protection, the pass leading to a pass, or the team play. In fact, I don't think he cares about those stats. For another video, I'd reccomend Thinking Basketballs Tim Duncan video or Clayton Crowleys video on Duncan. As I said before, I value BBIQ and passing, and with Duncan playing for Pop for 15 years, he certainly has those attributes. With so many superstars, it's nice to have a consistent guy like Duncan who can't really be gameplanned against that much.  Now, Shaq. Perhaps the most risky part of this team, he makes or breaks it. If he doesn't get along with the team, I'd just replace him with Hakeem or Kareem. But, if he DOES get along, what he offers can't be matched. With Curry like gravity, he's going to be essentially unstoppable. ""The most dominant player of all time."" That's his nickname, and it's earned. His ridiculous physique allowed him to bully his way into any position into the post and from there, he used his shocking finesse to get the bucket. Or he dunks over them. Either works. Players like Shaq and MJ are the reason this team has so many passers and floor stretchers. The less Klay has the ball while still stretching the floor, the greater Shaq will be. Imagine a lineup of Steph/Klay/Bird/Durant/Shaq. 4 out, 1 in, feasting. It'd be so damn nuts. He can rebound, defend and protect the rim, and is perhaps the most reliable and consistent bucket getter on the team. Pass to him and you have a 70% chance of 2 points. If he gets tripled, you have Bird or Klay ready to shoot. And if they are guarded, you probably have a high IQ player like Lebron ready to warp the defense to exploit the triple team, resulting in the most efficient shot. See Shaqs upside? All of that was possible thanks to him simply being, him.  Then, the last 2 are Rodman and Green. I was SO close to adding Pippen but removed him at the last second for Rodman. Dennis's main purpose will be acting as a rebounding and defensive plug when needed. I had lots of options but I took personalitites into account and I can't have say, Wilt as a 6th man. He wouldn't accept it. Draymonds main purpose would be providing the intangibles of spirit and fire, and acting as a ball handler. If Lebrons on the bench and Magic or Bird have been gameplanned against somehow, you have Draymond to fill that spot as the facilitator. He can't exactly shoot but in this lineup, you can play him smallball center or play Garnett at C to make up for it. Jordan/Steph/Klay/Dray/Garnett could be an unpredictable lineup but Jordan at 1 works. This team is just completely unstoppable. Running Lebron + 3nD? I'll go Magic/Jordan/Bird/Duncan/Shaq and feast on your vulnerable interior. Running an old school lineup? I'll go Steph/Klay/Bird/KD/Dray and burn you. This team literally cannot be beaten AT ALL because of the beautiful mix of BBIQ and playmaking. Players like Shaq are often used in ridiculous lineups like Magic/Kobe/MJ/Dirk/Shaq but be honest, does that lineup work? They're all great but this lineup, it's different. It synergises fantastically and brings the best out of everyone and with there being so many versatile options, it's essentially unbeatable."
"If they're missing Harden though they have literally no true playmakers behind Kyrie. Durant does something for that but 5.2 assists to 3.7 turnovers is not wonderful, we've never seen it but I suspect rolling him out there without a good point guard would turn into an iso fest, and not in the good LeBron way. He's still Kevin Durant, but that type of offense can rather easily be slowed down by a single elite defender like Thybulle"
Dude searched up “kevin durant is better than steph curry” on twiter lmaoo

There’s no way you’re serious with this take. Dame &gt; Kevin fucking Durant? Really?
"Are we talking about non superstars only? Kevin Durants ""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am"" although funny is the literal opposite of being humble lol"
They got beat by Jimmy Butler I’m taking Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for sure
"This is one of the stupidest things I’ve read in a long time. Curry had weapons at points? This is the only full season he’s played without Klay Thompson since they started winning. They’re 29-29. He cost them defensively every night. Ray almost won it all with Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham and Vin Baker. Are you in telling me you’d rather have that core than Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Iggy and Kevin Durant? Hollllllly shit. Certain points. Get the fuck outta here."
Kevin Durant is a very good NBA player who is good at basketball and basketball related things.
"Who is down voting this?  Best all time is not just a summation of rings and accolades, skill also plays a major factor in this.  Lebron is a better basketball player than kevin durant which is why his rings put him higher in the all time rankings even if they were gotten in a similar fashion."
"I think that argument was rendered ineffective when Kyrie dropped 37 playing alongside 3rd stringers and being guarded by Thyublle, Simmons and Embiid.            I cant imagine what Kevin Durant or James Harden would do to them......"

"This guy posted a tweet saying a cancer survivor/huge Lakers fan named Vivian was missing and to please find help her. Lakers players and Ice Cube's son even retweeted it. Then they said 'they found her alive' and started thanking everyone.  So Lakers Twitter Guys held a Twitter Spaces and revealed it wasn't a real person and her pictures at Staples were all photoshopped and her voice was like, using a voice-alter. She also catfished a Lakers Twitter Guy for a month and then he found out it was fake/she might even be a man. lol.  *Anyway,* Kevin Durant showed up and heard the story on the Spaces--kind of judged him for his decisions there.  Then Lakers Twitter got a visit from Taylor Rooks/the whole thing blew up and it's hitting like actual media outlets---and not real media outlets like the New York Post--and went viral.

"They had momentum . Klay was hot and then he got hurt. Easily could have been the reason they lost that game. Then if he plays game 7, warriors would be favored. Especially with Kevin Durant who may not have gotten hurt if they could have had the option to utilize Klay"
"If Steph Curry was Kevin Durant size, with the same skills he has now, he would be like roided up Barry Bonds. Imagine trying to guard Ben Simmons if he could shoot 45% from three. If pulled up at the logo if you didn't guard him out there."
"I said 40+ but thinking about it I think 25+ would probably be a reasonable minimum by end of the season.   Kevin Durant with .25 is very interesting though, given that this year he's listed as PF which, depending on exactly how he's played (I haven't watched many Nets games) would imply he's no longer as oversized in his position. I'm assuming that for the majority of the non-centres, jump-balls will come out of stifled shots in the paint."
"&gt;There are multiple top 20 players who are not ballhandlers lol. Any big man before the mid 2010s is prob going to be in that list.  You never watched Hakeem or Robinson or KG did you? They can all handle the ball much better than Durant can.   &gt;this is such an awful take LOL  Is this an awful take or are you just insecure and don't like what I am saying? Playmaking is the ability to read the floor and operate. So is team defense where you, again, must read the floor and react. It's not a crazy breaking concept like you're alluding to.   &gt;Also funny how it went from ""Durant is an average to below average defender"" to ""Durant is not an elite anchoring defender"" lmao.  What is '''funny''' is actual your inability to read and comprehend something so simple. It's not that Durant *needs* to anchor the defense; it's that he ***doesn't have a high end defensive game*** that would *outweigh* his dogshit playmaking. Again, all of the all time greats have one or two faults. Durant has multiple and is horrible at ***creating for others*** which is something that is essential to running an offense. He doesn't have groundbreaking defense to make up for it either.   &gt;KD shot 54.2% in 2016's postseason. League average TS% was 54%. KD shot 57% in 2014, league average was 54.1%. KD shot 57.4% in 2013, league average was 53.5%. These are big jumps except for 2016, which as I said before was his choke year and a big outlier LOL  Look up lebron and curry's TS% and compare them relatively and come back to me. A superstar who is arguably the best scorer of all time shooting 2% above league average---***all while maintaining elite regular season efficiency***--is pathetic. Do you really need me to explain this? Really dude?  &gt;yes kevin durant lacks bball IQ. The other team lets him score 30 ppg because he is the resident make a wish kid, and the mvp was a consolation prize.  Yes, playmaking and basketball IQ are deeply tied are you kidding me? What happened that MVP postseason, btw? Oh right, Durant almost choked worst than Dirk did in 2007 against the ***grizzlies*** and was bailed out by reggie fucking Jackson. You clearly started watching the NBA after 2017 if you constantly ignore Durant underperforming at the highest level in OKC  &gt;And not even true, his FGA is roughly the same form the RS to the PO, it's just the harder playoff defenses that reduce his efficiency  Now you're finally getting it. You rightly throw in 'reduce his efficiency' but you're failing to realize this is absolutely integral to the argument. Durant craters against -10 defenses when he does any sort of playmaking, ball handling or increasing his volume. Other superstars, besides harden, don't drop the levels Durant does.   &gt;crazy dumb criteria. this literally means that if ur not the point of ur finals team u don't count 😭  Crazy dumb criteria that actually has merit and data to back it up. If you're along for the ride but don't do any of the actual offensive lifting, how much merit does your win have? Durant joined a 73 win team after the unanimous MVP just completed the best scoring season of all time after losing in game 7 against arguably the best player of all time."
And kris Dunn and Kevin Durant have the same initials but only one of them is called KD
"It was an interesting down season by Bryant but he wasn't a top 3 player in 2010-11 season.      The top 3 players in the time frame you're asking;   2009; James, Wade, Bryant   2010; James, Wade Bryant   2011; Wade, Nowitzki, James      Also, Dwight Howard and Chris Paul were closer to be being top 3 than Kevin Durant in that time frame. And Nowitzki was always in the mix."
Basically Kevin Durant
"I feel like his link proves himself wrong. Beverley ranks above Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Damian Lilliard in career 3 point shooting."
I don't hate D Wade. Kevin Durant led the league in PPG three consecutive years from 2009 to 2011. He absolutely WAS one of the top players in the league. D Wade had ONE season of truly elite play and that was 2008-2009. LeBron has really made D Wade's legacy massively overhyped. Alonzo Mourning had more top 3 MVP finished than D Wade
The Toronto Raptors should’ve tanked when Kawhi Leonard left that sorry franchise. They would’ve had a chance at LaGOAT Ball. Fans of that sorry franchise cheer when Kevin Durant gets injured. Shameful. Good luck winning a championship the next 10 years Toronto Raptors fans.
"Steph was hitting these threes at Davidson, just as Thompson was making threes out of the womb. You were also gifted Kevin Durant, by and large it took an extreme amount of luck just like every other dynasty before it."
Giannis Antetokounmpo likes to bully bench players. I can’t wait to watch Kevin Durant bully him in the playoffs.
Kevin Durant?
Imagine if the Warriors add a Kevin Durant-esque player in Brandon Ingram. They would probably have a chance to three-peat.
Ok the fact that Kevin Durant made it into the headline is so irresponsible it’s actually hilarious
"The same goes for Abdul-Jabbar (the time he repeated, he was 40+ and way out of his prime), Chamberlain and Bird.      2 of those 3 still have legit cases to be the goat.      Would Kevin Durant be any more proven than Abdul-Jabbar, Duncan, Chamberlain, Bird just because he repeated/defended?.. This is not boxing...      —    It’s LeBron James btw."
"As horrible as I feel saying this, number 1 should probably be Klay. back to back ACL and Achilles injuries should do a number on his athleticism when he returns. However, everybody has said the same thing about John Wall and Kevin Durant, and they have been looking good so far so I really hope he comes back and looks good."
He had a higher usage rate than KD and I believe more shots per game as well when they were on the same team. This is KEVIN DURANT we’re talking about and Westbrook thought it appropriate to shoot more than him.
"He's one of the goats because he dominated his era, not in comparison to skill and production. For example, people will have him in their top ten, but not Kevin Durant, who's quite obviously better. That's the problem with comparing eras and hence my earlier comment."
Bro you are out here comparing KEVIN DURANT and JOHN WALL who literally TORE THEIR ACHILLES to LUKE KENNARD who has knee tendinitis  Flair checks out by the way 😂

"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Jokic would feast any lineup in the league  or steph, klay, kd, draymond, AD if you cared about defense"
"""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
They drafted and got him some big pieces in coach Kerr and Kevin Durant iggy they (the front office ) just got him the best people to help him win
Kevin Durant in the 2017 NBA Finals.
"I mean, no question GS still would’ve pushed to get KD even if they won that 2016 title. But joining an already established champion would certainly look bad on KD’s part (even though joining Golden State as they lost the title already looked bad enough, this would’ve been much worse). Durant even openly said that he was “glad” that the Warriors lost in the Finals because it got him to think about the possibilities if he joined them.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2668863-kevin-durant-says-hes-glad-warriors-lost-2016-nba-finals-to-cavaliers"
"This includes Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook."
"Correction: there is one reason, which is to prevent Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant from whining about their friend not getting enough minutes"
"Cause it came from Morey.   He's not the greatest scorer of...anything, he's not even the greatest scorer of his generation - that's LeBron/KD right now.  Here's some regular season career averages for comparison:  - LeBron James, 11 seasons: 27.2ppg on 59% TS  - Kevin Durant, 9 seasons: 27ppg on 61% TS  - James Harden, 9 seasons: 25ppg on 61% TS  For reference's sake:  - Michael Jordan, 13 seasons, 30.1ppg on 57% TS"
Kevin Durant put up some scrub numbers SMH
I’m sorry are you seriously implying that Steve Nash was greater than Kevin Durant?
"Embarrassing takes. People really expect the Nets to have a hard time to make the NBA Finals?  You’re betting on Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Mike Budenholzer over Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the playoffs?   Skip to the NBA Finals already."
"Harden wasn't the reason for that rule change, at least not the only one. Kevin Durant was the [absolute master of the rip-through move.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvhzJLgDJWQ)"
Did we not recently see Kevin Durant get cleared to play and then make his injury catastrophically worse by playing on it for just 12 minutes?
"Nobody cares about pickup games you play with random bums. We’re talking about basketball at the highest level, and on this level an offence that has role players attempt a high volume of mid-range shots is gonna suck and be competent unable to keep up with teams that actually play correctly.   Sure, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker can take a lot of them because they’re actually good shooters. Danny Green and Robert Covington and like 90% of role players should be shooting threes or layups almost exclusively because 40% mid-range shooting is terrible."
Super saturated with a bunch of guys who will never beat Kevin Durant or Lebron James in a playoff series
"Harden and Steph led the league in total points scored in 2016 and it wasn't close, but the minutes played differential is absurd when you look at it:  1) James Harden - 2376 points, 50/36/86, 3125 minutes played  2) Steph Curry - 2375 points, 56/45/90, *2700 minutes played*  3) Kevin Durant - 2029 points, 57/30/90, 2578 minutes played  Harden beat out Steph by 1 total point in 2016 and he *needed 425 more minutes played to do it.* Basically played almost 9 more entire games of basketball and managed a single point more than Steph.  That's how fucking busted Steph's 2016 season was."
"No, I pointed out that your implication skipped over Kevin Durant being part of that team. Which is a pretty important thing to skip over basketball-wise. Insane to miss out even.  (And of course before Durant you had the time when Draymond wasn't an awful at 3pters, or when Barnes was shooting in the high 30%s from 3. If part of this hypothetical is that Derrick Jones Jr suddenly starts knocking down 3s at high efficiency then I'm all behind it)."
"It really doesn't.  The book on Portland for the past five seasons or so has been to show hard on Lillard when he comes around a screen, leave one man on CJ and pack the paint because no-one else could hit a 3. Playing Draymond sends you back into that problem.  If you're going to slot Kevin Durant in the team then great. But you can't talk about a great fit when you're running a lineup that has two players that shoot 3s."
"Simmons Embiid and Tobias ""Kevin Durant"" Harris"
"Pair Dame with a player of Klay, 2014-2018 Draymond Green, and three years of Kevin Durant and we'll talk."
Kevin Durant was never going to the Knicks. Knicks fans might be more embarrassing than Hawks fans.
You were 6th last season and the 7th were getting Kevin Durant back.
He did not bet on himself lol wtf. The warriors got Kevin Durant and were not going to re-sign Barnes. He just took the best offer.
"Didn’t he say he wanted to retire in Brooklyn, that it was his last stop? Or did I make that up?  It’s probably Brooklyn, though I’d love to see his career make things right with OKC  Yep: https://www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2020/10/9/21509142/kevin-durant-on-whether-he-wants-to-retire-a-net-as-of-today-this-second-yes  He says “as of this second, yes”. Obviously that could change"
&gt; MIP is just the “player whose PPG increased the most because of a new team/role” award  Who is MIP this year? I can probably give you a few names to make it at least a debate.  We're only 6/7 games in and I can already tell you that Kevin Durant would get the CPOTY award this year (with John Wall as an outside chance) and Klay Thompson would get it next year.  At least the Ingram vs Bam debate last year was more interesting.
"**Biggest surprises:** Sabonis having a career year, Tobias Harris bouncing back from an awful 1st game to winning EC Player of the Week and looking excellent ever since, John Wall immediately returning to form, Steph immediately returning to form, Kevin Durant looking awesome after the injury, Knicks actually looking good under Thibs, PG13 off to an amazing start without Kawhi, Celtics looking better than I expected. Also the rookies seem to be doing very well despite it being called a weak draft. Got guys popping off all over the league.                **Biggest disappointments:** Siakam falling off a cliff since the bubble, Wizards with a lot of close losses (I had them as a playoff team with Russ, not that they can't turn it around), Nets with a few disappointing losses after looking dominant early on, Raptors in general look bad, Oubre's start. Nothing that can't be fixed though on this list."
"&gt; If Harden gets to Brooklyn, reportedly his top preference, would he give up shots and some control to mesh with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, two of the league’s most dominant scorers?  In Brooklyn, Kyrie should probably be the one giving up the most shots of the three.  Harden and KD should be sacrificing the least in my opinion.  Obviously everyone should sacrifice *some,* but I think it makes sense for Kyrie to sacrifice the most, as he's the worst player of the three by a good margin."
Kevin Durant: Sandwich Artist
"Honestly, the rules committee just needs to clarify these rules so there are no grey areas. It’s fairly simple to me.  If I’m a defender I am allowed my ESTABLISHED space. If the offensive player encroaches my cemented position and makes contact while I have done nothing in return (reaching, swiping, ect.) then that simply cannot be a foul. If the offensive player lowers their shoulder into me, extends the off arm, or hooks me with the off arm that’s an offensive foul. Under these pretenses things like rip throughs and guys jumping into defenders (in Trae’s case jumping backwards into Rivers) all encroach MY space which IS NOT A FOUL.  Offensive player’s already have such a huge advantage since you aren’t allowed hand checking on defense anymore that removing these “foul farming moves” simply restores some semblance of balance to the game.  Like what am I supposed to do against someone like Kevin Durant now? If I stick my hand out in space to prepare to contest a pull up jumper he simply rips his arms through MINE and draws a foul. If I contest his jumper too closely and don’t allow him a helipad of landing space it’s a foul. If he drives and we make contact at any point and he flails his arms and gets knocked back it’s a foul. EVEN if I play PERFECT defense and have both arms vertical and DO NOT jump to contest his layup - it’s sometimes called a foul depending on his reaction."

"Thats so weird y'all have Jarrett Allen, DeAndre Jordan, and Kevin Durant. How is post defense and rebounding the issue? I havent been able to see many of yalls games but I feel like those three by themselves have a solid history and reputation of good rim protection and rebounding. Have they regressed in those categories? Or low effort? Either way yall can still pull it together. You have Kyrie and KD that alone will get you in the playoffs. What you do from there is up to them."
"CP3: ""I didn't have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant carrying me up and down the court!"""
I see you haven’t met Kevin Durant.
"NBA Finals games and playoff games impress me more than regular season games.  Wardell Stephen Curry II chokes in the NBA Finals and there are better regular season players than him in the league.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyrie Irving are better than Wardell Stephen Curry II. Two regular season games against the Blazers and Kings doesn’t change anything."
Kevin Durant: a subway story
Kevin Durant had to join the most stacked team of all time because he needed that much help to beat Lebron. Kd's biggest carry job of his career resulted in losing to Memphis in the one series he played without a co-star.

"Not as far as I know so that info is odd (or misleading), it has been 11 media members for a while, [here's an article with that info](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/12/15788456/how-is-the-nba-finals-mvp-awarded-cavs-vs-warriors-lebron-james-kevin-durant-jerry-west) + [Wikipedia with the same info at the start of the post about it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award)   If that changed at any point, sorry.*"
"This is a big reason why Kevin Durant is so unguardable. Him and James Harden are both amazing players, but Harden's shot selection is pretty predictable. He'll either go with a 3 or layup, so it makes it easier to plan for him, especially in the playoffs.  Whereas Durant, he shoots from all over the place. His shot diversity is quite possibly the most interesting I've ever seen. Plus he just hits those shots. He has 3 seasons where he shot 49% or better from mid range in 60+ games played. In a regular season, Durant normally takes ~18-22% of his shots from mid range, so it's not like he's doing this on a small sample size. In addition to that, he has 4 seasons where he shot 48% or better from long 2 range and 6 seasons of shooting at least 38% from three. In a normal season for Durant, ~16% of his shots are from long 2 range and 25%+ are from 3. This makes him VERY hard to plan for because when he has the ball you don't know what he's gonna do because his shot selection is so unpredictable"

"Not every player gets tested everyday and the tests are notorious for false positives and negatives. Walmart is dealing with much, much, much larger numbers of people than the NBA is. The NBA is actively trying to protect teams, Walmart isn’t doing anything more than what they are legally required to continue operating and don’t give a shit if people get sick at their stores. If safety was the primary driver behind Walmart then their policies would look a lot more like the NBA’s whose policies actually are putting safety ahead of making a profit on star players not playing games. Obviously the NBA prefers that Kevin Durant plays because him not playing hurts their bottom line."
"You're right. I think early uncertainty about how the virus operates combined with poor communication from the media has caused a ton of misinformation to spread. Firstly, reinfection is not a concern. If you have a second confirmed case (verified not just through a positive PCR test which have their own myriad of issues, and especially fuck the ""rapid"" tests the NBA uses exclusively) after recovering from the first case, buy a lottery ticket. Secondly, surface (fomite) transmission was an early concern but newer data has shown it is almost entirely nonexistent.  Kevin Durant is not a transmission risk because surface-to-surface transmission is statistically negligible, and his existing immunity prevents the virus from reproducing within his body in enough of a quantity to be a concern for droplet transmission.  At the end of a day, it's a respiratory virus, and it behaves as such. I get being cautious, but there's no reason to ignore science."
"Bro you are getting mad at me for calling Harden a top 5 player in the world lmao. I’m on this sub all the time telling how good of a player I think Harden is. It’s all subjective but is it wrong from me to think you might be a little biaised being a Rockets fan? At the end of the day, KD and Kawhi both were the first option on a championship team, something Harden couldn’t do. I hope you guys figure it out in Houston and he’s able to win a ring there but right now I don’t see a valid argument that would justify saying Harden is a better player than Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard"

LeBron James got swept by Kevin Durant in the Finals that year. Who considers that one of LeBron’s biggest carry jobs of his career? Embarrassing.  That’s like believing Wardell Stephen Curry II was a top 2 player in the NBA in 2015 and 2016. You can’t ignore the NBA Finals.
"&gt;I don't think he's particularly overpaid.   I don't think he's overpaid, but my reasons are a bit different than yours. I'm kind of using this as a piggyback to go off on a bit of a rant, so bare with me.  The NBA has a salary cap and a maximum salary. This has enormous ripple effects. The true superstars will never earn as much from salary as a team is willing to pay them. Nobody can get Kevin Durant in free agency via paying him more. That means a player is comparing destinations based on (a) supporting cast (teammates and coaches) and/or (b) the location (market, city, franchise prestige). This realistically means you have to be a good team or be one of only a handful of franchises that can sell itself without being good, which are currently the two LA teams, Miami, and to a lesser extent Brooklyn. The Knicks don't have that cache right now because they've been bad so long. Imo, this is a major reason why tanking is so prevalent, but that's a different rant.  In theory, the max salary was supposed to let small markets compete with big markets in spending. But the negative is that they can't pay any more to keep star players. Enter the Super Max contract. It's designed to solve this problem, even if some small markets are now worried that giving out a Super Max will cripple their ability to spend in the future. The Super Max is set at two per team. There are 60 slots for this contract. Anyone who is eligible is likely a top-60 player. It sucks that the payment structure is so messed up that LeBron and the 30th-best player will make similar salaries, but that's what was created.   So, I don't think he's overpaid because he's good enough to get one of those contracts. It's just the cap and the max contract that's distorted the rest of the league's contracts."
How do you carry prime Kevin Durant?
"it's klay, not kevin durant  how the hell would they be contenders with lakers/clips  have you not watched how they looked so far this season? Klay will fix everything? Their bottom 3 defense?"
"idk bro it might just be me but losing Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson sounds worse than losing Kyrie or Chris Bosh."
"I’m not a Westbrook fan though I certainly respect his game.  He’s probably so sick of Kevin Durant by now, the endless prying and questions.  It’s like reporters know Westbrook is an emotional guy and want to keep poking him til they get him riled up so they can quote him.  I kinda wish he would just come out and say.. don’t ask me any questions about KD ever again"
Yeah. These were the odds   Luka Doncic +400 Giannis Antetokounmpo +425 Stephen Curry +500 LeBron James +700 Anthony Davis +700 James Harden +800 Kawhi Leonard +900 Kevin Durant +1000

Depends on what you’re training for. In the past steph most likely trained to maintain and improve what skills he had. This past off season he was training coming of an injury going into a season without Kevin Durant on top of the fact he’s not getting younger. So he probably switched his training up to compensate for all those things. Choosing to get stronger/gain mass can greatly affect gameplay in positive or negative ways. In this case it’s super positive.

Steph microwaved so many times in his prime that he could have scored 80 easily if given the opportunity to shoot at will, but that's not what was necessary.     If you told me that the next time Steph and Dame play, they're each going to take 40 shots, and I had to bet on who scores more....I'm picking Steph every time without hesitation."
There is only one guy who has a good argument of being a better scorer than Jordan and that’s Kevin Durant. Love Curry but let’s not get too ahead of ourselves.
"Media personalities, but switch Kevin Durant and James Harden. Kyrie Irving is a better offensive player than Wardell Stephen Curry II too.   What an embarrassing post man. My opinion is not based on other people’s opinion. I watch basketball games and ignore the media clowns."
"""I'm Kevin Durant, you know who I am"""
KEVIN DURANT FROM DOWNTOWN!  AND GOLDEN STATE TAKES THE LEAD
So now you know Curry now has a higher career high than:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Damian Lillard  James Harden  Shaquille O’Neal  Anthony Davis
The Grizzlies were legit. Kevin Durant lost to the same team int he same year.
I know it’s been 12 years. I get it. But I fucking wish Kevin Durant was still a Sonic so bad. I get genuinely depressed about not having a team whenever KD does something dope like this.
"It's hard to talk about this topic without an absurd amount of salt. For me personally I recognize how clutch those shots were. I also recognize how incredibly easy it is to get off a shot like that in single coverage the entire game with no double teams and little help defense. That's why I think Kevin Durant was the best player on the Warriors, but Steph was the most valuable. His gravity (along with Klay) created so many open looks for the entire team and their offense was built around it. We also have to remember Kevin Durant did not close out the Warriors in 2016 while being up 3-1 as the best and most valuable player on the Thunder, and doing this while shooting very poorly and having many turnovers in all losing games."
nets should have signed greg oden over known scrub kevin durant
 *Kyrie Irving* said Lebron James  was the first teammate he trusted to take clutch shots.  Kevin Durant said the quote hurt him
"It was 100% when the Raptors won the Finals. Nobody expected them to get that far, and no one thought GSW would have Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant Injured (again)."
maybe give the ball to kevin durant
"CP3 stuff is from early in KD's career and Pat Pev stuff probably died in that ""I'm Kevin Durant"" series"
You’re just prepping yourself to be disappointed. Nobody can stop Kevin Durant.
Why is it that Kyrie feels the need to take more shots than Kevin Durant every single time he's on the floor?

Let me make this clear I have always been a Kevin Durant fan
Kevin Durant is very good
"Kevin ""Harvey Dent"" Durant"
kevin durant is like 7'5
Kevin Durant is a GOAT contender  Top 5 all time?
So much for Kevin Durant being the best player in the world
USA still has Kevin Durant be calm.
"1st Quarter takeaways:  - USA defense looks really good, except when it doesn't  - Spain, especially Ricky Rubio, has hit a toooon of tough shots, ones which seemed close to impossible  - Kevin Durant is such a black hole on offense that it appears he thinks he's back on the Nets during the Bucks series  - USA has missed quite a few wide open, completely open, shots, and when they're missing, they look beatable. Results best when they're moving towards the hoop, but this is a perimeter-oriented team."
Kyrie you’re just good at basketball that doesn’t mean you were Kevin Durant in a previous life
"If you're Kevin Durant and already a GOAT scorer maybe, yeah"
"USA has 9 All Stars on their roster  Spain has 2 All Stars (Gasol Brothers)  Spain aging:  Pau Gasol - 41 Marc Gasol - 36 Rudy Fernandez - 36 Sergio Rodriguez - 35  Gotta wonder if they can keep up with the younger US legs.   Spain has played US tough in 3 straight Olympics, but that was their prime (Golden) generation for basketball…   Will experience outweigh youth tonight for Spain?  With Kevin Durant out there I say no."
"They’ll always pick the oddest things to overreact about. PJ was nice in that he set the tone for the Bucks defensively and allowed them to fully adopt the switch heavy scheme. But realistically speaking, the guy was 36 and lost a step defensively; I don’t think he was super impactful defensively in the Finals. You could say he did well against Kevin Durant, but KD did average like 35 on 47% shooting lol. Also provided nothing on offense.  Semi should be a fine replacement. Ten years younger, and he’s way affordable on a vet min than paying Tucker to go deeper into the tax.   Fine move. If he doesn’t play well, trade him for cash and look for another wing defender on the buyout market or by trade."
kevin durant new stopper?
"No, you're right. Thanks for catching my mistake. I thought he was hurt in game 3. It goes further to show that Kevin Durant didn't ""almost [win] the series by himself."""
He killed their spacing all playoffs and was a big reason why BKN could employ the help defense they did on Giannis and even Middleton. Kevin Durant literally had one of the best series in years vs the Bucks and people are talking about PJ Tucker's defense on him because he barked at him and would foul him every other play.
The Anti Kevin Durant
I never heard about Kevin Durant but CJ and Dame were doing an IG live on the NBA Instagram account and a fan made a comment about one of the guy’s hair looking like Jamal‘s pubes and CJ read it on the air  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ySRE7199zRo
"At the time, we did talk about how the Warriors did things the right way. Found their superstar and core players through the draft, built incredibly well around those core players, and won a ring doing so.  Then they got Kevin Durant, and all of that went out the window."
I think a big part of it is that when people think of the warriors dynasty many of them think of Kevin Durant joining an already ridiculously good team because that happened more recently
"Kevin ""Megaman"" Durant"
"&gt;5 years ago the Warriors were 73-9, Kevin Durant hadn’t signed 3 contracts with 2 different teams, and the Lakers, 76ers, Nets, Suns, and Bucks were all terrible.  I get what you're saying, but those types of shifts aren't really changing the Cavs future right now.  To offer a comparison, take Khris Middleton.  Bucks signed him coming off a 41-41 season, where Khris was the 3rd leading scorer at 13.4 PPG, behind Brandon Knight and Michael Carter Williams.  His 5 years/$70M was comparable then to what 5 years/$100M would be for Allen this year.  But that's what small market teams need to do.  Lebron isn't coming back (again), and the Cavs need to collect long-term assets that might turn into something.  If they believe Allen is a *potential* good pairing with Mobley and/or Sexland, then hell yeah keep him here 5 years, let's see what we've got.  Capela would be another example.  Didn't transcend to superstar, but stayed a good version of himself, and because of the 5 year contract, was a valuable contract to trade away when the Rockets went into rebuild mode."
Because that Warriors run was retroactively tainted by association with a certain Kevin Durant by some people.  That ignores the fact that the Ws won it all before KD joined.
Remember when Stephen A told Kevin Durant to his face that he knew he was signing with the Lakers and would t back down even though KD kept saying no.  Pepperidge farm remembers
"Kevin ""Kise"" Durant"
"They have a 3x DPOY and a guy who is *fifth* **all-time** in PPG in the playoffs ahead of LeBron Fucking James, and only behind some dudes named Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant, and Jerry West.   They would've won 60 games this year if there was an 82 game season, and their SRS is comparable to the Bucks in 2018-19."
"Five years is an eternity in the NBA, nothing is guaranteed.   5 years ago the Warriors were 73-9, Kevin Durant hadn’t signed 3 contracts with 2 different teams, and the Lakers, 76ers, Hawks, Suns, and Bucks were all terrible."
"I am not everyone else that you are talking about.   Kevin Durant made the biggest bitch move in NBA history. That is why he isnt liked. Not because he left. People were even kinda hype that he might return home and play with Wall and Beal in DC.  He doesnt need you to defend him. He does it himself on social media with his endless burners because he knows what he did was a bitch move and has 0 self esteem.   To each their own, I have no problem with you liking KD. You just seem to have an issue that a lot of people dont.   Stay in your lane bruh."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"

"Definitely watch some historical clips over the years to watch how the game started and has developed. I personally recommend starting around the 80s and watching some highlights of the Celtics and Lakers match-ups, especially their finals match-ups. Detroit in the late '80s brought an overwhelming defensive presence to the game which changed things up a bit. Then of course you have to watch the greatness that was Michael Jordan in the 90s, the double three-peat.   After that you'll be caught up to the 2000s where things are a lot more current and familiar. Assuming you don't know but the Lakers (Shaq and Kobe) and San Antonio Spurs were the powerhouse teams in the early 2000s, followed by a power move by the Celtics in 08 to form ""the first"" ""Big Three."" I personally believe this move  by the Celtics is what has powered a lot of the motivation behind free agency/trades over the last decade plus. Around that same time was the rise of LeBron James, widely regarded as the second-best player (or best, depending who you are talking to) to Michael Jordan. LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat started his Finals dominance the last decade which was very entertaining to watch as he showed up in the Finals nine out of ten years from 2011-2020 with the Heat, Cavaliers, and now Lakers.   The Golden State Warriors rose as a titan in 2015 and began their reign, with Steph Curry greatly evolving the game by extending the expectations of 3 point shooting. Kevin Durant, regarded as the current second-best player to LeBron James in the NBA, joined the Warriors in 2016 and formed what was known as the ""Hampton Five"" - which was arguably the best line-up in the history of the NBA. Kevin Durant left the Warriors after 2019 for the Nets, which brings us to today's game (upcoming year) where there has been somewhat of a vacuum left by the Warriors from the last decade, in which several teams are in-contention (including the Warriors, I think) for the upcoming years to establish a new dynasty.   James Harden's trade from the Rockets to the Nets was regarded as the largest move last year and many expect Brooklyn to take home the championship in the next 1-2 years. It is a great time to get in the game as there are many young players on several teams who are still blossoming as the leaders of their franchises and are expected to join the ranks of the elite like Trae Young on the Hawks, Zion Williams on the Pelicans, and now you could say Cade Cunningham on the Pistons - while we are still watching the rise of other potential all-time greats like Giannis on the Bucks, Joel Embiid on the Sixers, and Luka Doncic on the Mavericks.  Great time to get into the sport and hope you enjoy it!"
&gt; steal some of his techniques  Kevin “Orochimaru” Durant
"Well the Durant one is fresh but it wasn't a missed shot , so for the modern era I'm going Steph Curry , if he makes his shot against Kevin Love the game gets tight again, maybe that changes how the rest of that game goes in a possible overtime and maybe they win it and no Kevin Durant to the Warriors and all those ramifications    I'm going with Frank Selvy game 7 in 1962, if that shot goes in the Celtics don't win eight straight, Elgin Baylor gets a ring , Jerry West gets one earlier , and the Lakers probably win a couple more championships to close out the decade oh, I believe after a while the Celtics just got in the Lakers heads to where they couldn't even beat them with Wilt Chamberlain, and all those finals loss has gotten their head as well because they had their issues with the Knicks afterwards"

That's cause that next December Kyrie was already talking to Kevin Durant about teaming up and then proceeded to tank the playoffs on purpose
Paul George and Leonard comnined are going to miss the same amount of games as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving combined.  Charlotte gets their first ring somehow. Let's say a fourth previously unknown Ball brother carries them to a 65 win season
"Because Donovan kicks it into a higher gear in the playoffs. He has ever since his rookie year. 120 average regular season games don't matter compared to ten, twenty, thirty exceptional playoff games because the playoffs are where you have to put it all on the line to excel. Balling out in the regular season is great if you want to rack up individual accolades, but playoff performances matter *way more* in determining the actual strength of a player. If you can go from being a 24ppg moderately efficient scorer in the regular season to a 29ppg super-efficient flamethrower in the playoffs and you can do it with consistency, then you're not a middle-of-the-road fringe all-star guy, you're a superstar. Mitchell has, among all active players, the second highest playoff PPG in the NBA after Kevin Durant. Even counting small-sample size guys like Booker who had his first playoffs run this year, and looked really good. Guys who take it up another level in the playoffs are just more valuable than players who might be identical to them in the regular season.  You mentioned matchup being a complicating factor, so we can expand the range a little bit if you want - go from just the last two years to the last four, which means Dame should theoretically be really heavily advantaged thanks to his WCF run during the year the Raptors won plus the fact that he's just been in this league for a longer time, whereas Mitchell starts this comparison as a rookie and he had to play against a very scary switching Rockets defense *twice*where he was the only shot creator on the team. In theory, Dame should be heavily favored because he *also* got to play against a worse version of that Nuggets team that Mitchell torched, plus a pretty weak Spurs roster.   Dame's stats are 41.9/38.8/88.3 shooting splits with counting totals of 26.9/4.5/6.9 and a true shooting of 58.2% if we want to round favorably for him, all in approximately 40 minutes per game.   Mitchell's stats are 43.6/39.4/86.2 shooting splits, with counting totals of 28.8/5.1/4.6 and a true shooting of 56.7% (again, rounded up just a touch) in about 37 minutes per game.  So the takeaway here is that in spite of two really bad series against the Rockets in a very unfavorable matchup, Mitchell is actually a *little bit more efficient* shooting from the floor than Dame is, buuut he doesn't quite get to the line as much as Lillard does, and Dame's shot profile is a little bit cleaner, which means he has a bit higher TS% over the last four years in the playoffs. Like I said, this is a game of inches in terms of pure scoring, and about 2-3 assists per game which is, I admit, a meaningful difference between the two - it's not a meaningful enough one to act as though the gulf between these two players is super significant though, and that Mitchell and Dame shouldn't be spoken of as similar-caliber players. While I wouldn't rank either one in my top five, I think Dame has a good case for fringe top-ten, and I think Mitchell has a case for being a fringe top-15 guy, and I don't think that the gulf between those two spots is nearly as large as like ""top ten versus top seven or eight"" and ""top seven or eight versus top 3""."
"Ok, I’m going to drop a few old names in because why not, Lebron, Steph Curry, Irving, Giannis, Kobe (RIP), MJ, Shaq, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Dennis Rodman, Kawhi Leonard. There’s probably a 1 or 2 other names that I recognise that I haven’t put down but that’s all I know of the top of my head, past and present."
"Yeah as a bucks fan I feel this one. So many people are trying to put an asterisk on this championship because of injuries which is just dumb to me. The heat were a decent team, and a pretty tough team to face in the first round of the playoffs. Yes, KD lost his two right-hand-men but it’s still Kevin Durant lol and he played hall of fame basketball against us so it was far from a cake walk. We played the hawks and beat them twice in a row without Giannis, with one being on their home floor, after they had played an incredible stretch of basketball and beat philly. And then we played you guys, the suns, who did have some injuries, even among players that played through it. But, Chris Paul and D Book were still there, and Paul was killing us early in the series and book played really well throughout. Your role players also really stepped up in the series, especially Cam Johnson, Payne, and Crowder (which I expected, crowder is always a pain in the ass for the bucks). And it’s annoying as hell to see people discrediting both the bucks and the suns for things out of their control, that we also struggled with (you guys lost some key players, and we lost probably our best scoring and defensive player of the bench in Divincenzo). Hell, game 1 of the finals giannis was pretty limited and did not play nearly as many minutes as normal, and Chris Paul was dealing with torn ligaments in his hand and was having shoulder issues. You don’t win a championship on pure luck and both of our teams played well enough to deserve a championship."

And why do you automatically classify a tall guy that can shoot as a small forward? Is that as per some rule book or is it something arbitrary in your mind? Why is Kevin Durant listed at small forward and then PG is listed at SG?   When you wrote your definition of what a PG and center is...where did you get that from? Is it from a rulebook or some sort of defined guide on what those positions are? What are those positions based on...size? Skillset? Positioning on the court? If you did not get your definition from a standard guide and are producing it from your understanding of the game then how sure are you that others all have the same definition for what those positions mean? I really hope you get the point im making but in case you dont then let me know and I will try to articulate myself better"

"&gt; Book still has many years to make the finals again.  This is the point that Draymond was making. Thinking Books' got all the time in the world to make it back to the finals is a mistake. This literally could've been his only chance at a chip. If the 2012 OKC Thunder couldn't return to their second finals after making their first one boasting a roster with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka, all on rookie scale deals then no one really has many years to make the finals again."
"Gotta slow down there buddy, you got a lot of hypotheticals that don't work for your case. Also, positions aren't exclusively a one title thing. You can play multiple positions, positions help IDENTIFY a person's strongest potential skillset and where they are on the court. Like you said, you need your center (the person with the best hops or height) to catch the jumpball. ""What if Steph happen to be the size of Embiid:"" Well there's a name for that, Kevin Durant and LeBron James play small forward. The in-between where you are more agile than a center, but as stronger than a PG. Jokic is a power forward, but LeBron also plays as a power forward. That's why they invented 5 positions. And these are GENERATIONAL talent, not everyone will have these skillsets, it also helps determine which roleplayers to get. It's the fundamentals.  It helps determine where they stand to make their offense or defense flow better. If you really understand modern or classic basketball you would know that."
Kevin Durant is thinking about signing with them
"He also throws out a lot of stuff that dosnt stick though, like Kevin Durant to the Lakers"
&gt; Since when was Kevin fucking Durant and James fucking Harden the second tier of the NBA?  Since LeBron and Steph existed.  When is Thunderstruck 2 coming out?
Um what? Since when was Kevin fucking Durant and James fucking Harden the second tier of the NBA? KD is the #2 player of the past decade after Bron
"According to 538 Kevin Durant is a ""key role player"" and has a 5 year market value of 5mil. So I'm not sure I'm a fan of this algorithm...."
*flashbacks*   at least we got Kevin Durant out of it I guess but still that hurts to this day
Not all of us. Half of r/nba is Kevin Durant
Relatively unknown one: Kevin Durant
"Lol ah yes the 4-0 sweep of curry, klay, KD, draymond vs Lebron and the amazing Kevin Love. Such a difficult team for Durant to overcome. What a legend!!! Let’s just call the east weak as shit but forget about KD joining a 73-9 team to get his titles. Couldn’t do it without another 3 stars. At least lebron got his titles with only 2 other stars and 1 other star on the Lakers. If Kevin Durant is the best player why couldn’t he carry the nets to the playoffs. 2007 Lebron carried his shitty team to the finals then did it again in 2018"
The most stacked team in nba history was Kevin Durant on the Wariors.
"Lol yes 36 year lebron vs 32 year old KD.   Lebron at 32 years old: 3 titles, 4 MVPs  Durant at 32 years old: 2 titles, 1 MVP  Kevin Durant has lost in the first round twice at the age of 32. Lebron had never lost in the first round at 32. Seems like Kevin Durant is much worse."
"My point isn’t that the foot being an inch off the line is a fluke or not, my point is that the series should never go to 7 games against literally just Kevin Durant. Durant is easily better than Giannis. Be happy y’all got a ring bruh, he’s top 4 for sure"
There is always a possibility that is Kevin durant
"Fuck Kevin Durant by Lil B is the best NBA song, it's purely genius from a lyrical standpoint"
Kevin Durant left the team he was leading.  Westbrook has been traded because teams rebuilt.  Harden requested a trade because his contending level team was being blown up to shed salary.
"No, the NBA updated all heights to be accurate in 2019. Kevin Durant is 6'10."
"Ben Simmons, Rudy Gobert, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant."
Quote by Kevin Durant?
"you put harden there before kevin durant, the best player on hardens team by far"
good thing jrue holiday didn't lock up kevin durant lol
Kevin Durant
Not exactly the *most* surprising but Stephen Curry set the record for the most points in a 4 game playoff sweep in the 2019 WCF where he averaged 37ppg (146 total points) on 66% TS against the Blazers to sweep them without Kevin Durant.
"Y’all beat a weak Miami Heat team, barely beat Kevin Durant, beat a Hawks team that was missing Trae for two games, and then beat the PHO Suns that wasn’t even supposed to be in the Finals in the first place. Bucks are probably the weakest champs in modern NBA. Dallas Mavs went through POR-LA-OKC-MIA that’s LMA/Brandon Roy, 3x Finals 2x b2b champ Lakers, OKC Big 3, and then the Heatles. Without a sliver of the talent Giannis had. That’s what a paradigm championship team is"
"Andre Iguodala himself said OKC was the best team in the playoffs that year: https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/14/andre-iguodala-thunder-best-team-playoffs-cavs-warriors  &gt; ""Now that we got [Kevin Durant] I can say it,” Iguodala said. “The Thunder were the best team in the playoffs. They were better than us, they were better than Cleveland. They should have won a championship. They played us better than anyone. They had our number."""
"Entire league is available?  Yeah let me just trade Wiggins, Wiseman, Kuminga, Moody for Kevin Durant, Giannis and Kawhi then. Really neat how these things work!"
1. Jordan  2. LeBron   3. Kareem (switchable with LeBron)  4. Russell   5. Magic  6. Bird (switchable with Magic)  7. Wilt  8. Duncan  9. Shaq  10. Olajuwon (switchable with Shaq)  11. Kobe  12. Robertson  13. Moses Malone  14. Jerry West  15. Kevin Durant
"One strong contender is from one guy I knew who was a Cavs ""fan""(really more of a Bron stan lol)  He used to come up with ""insult"" nicknames for all the Warriors players during their ""superteam"" era but it was just feminizing everyone's name lol:  Steph Curry = Stephanie Curry  Kevin Durant = Keisha Durant  and so on  That's middle school tier humor lol"
Roberson? Ibaka? Kevin Durant?
Hope your playing the bucks or Kevin durant lol derozan and Westbrook seems to shoot better against then for some reason
"Kevin Durant on setting the US Olympic record for points scored - ""This guy next to me will be the next one."" The guy next to him is TJ Warren, who scored 53 points in a single game."
"It’s cute how KD hypes up Tatum, like during the playoffs when he said playing against him was like [playing against Lebron, Kobe, and Tim Duncan](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/kevin-durant-pays-celtics-jayson-tatum-ultimate-compliment)"

"Well no there is money involved actually, but that's besides the point. To say it's not about the level of the game is absolutely dismissive. If the USA wins gold this year so what? Everybody knows the US has the best players in the world and could win every year if they really wanted to, but it's just not that big of a deal to most players. Honestly, it seems like most of the player on the US team are playing because they just want to experience the Olympics.         It means more for smaller countries to perform well in basketball at the Olympics than it does for the US because the US is the consensus best country at basketball. The real competition and proof of skill for US players is in the NBA. And why risk your career and legacy playing in the Olympics? These are people that could earn hundreds of millions of dollars over a 10 year period from playing basketball. It's the exact same reason people leave college early to go to the pros. Yeah, you could win a championship for your school, or you could make an extra ten million by getting drafted.        Kevin Durant broke the all-time scoring record for the USA today. Who cares? If somebody broke Kareem's record in the NBA, they'd probably be considered the greatest player to ever live.  So why don't people care about Olympic all-time scoring records? Because it's just the USA whooping up on other countries.      And honestly, I'd say you're out of your mind if you really think that Luka would rather win a gold medal than an NBA final."
Kevin Durant is the new team USA All time Olympic scoring leader. Amazing
"Jayson ""Kevin Durant"" Tatum"
Kevin Durant versus the World.
“But uhhhhh Kevin Durant?” Killed me
Did Kevin Durant pay these guys for that? *cringe*
"Kevin Durant sucks, he can't lead, and team USA has no chemistry."
LOL the Nets this season had the greatest offensive efficiency of all time. They shot poorly for one half of a game. They got endless open looks. Good luck trying to get Kevin Durant to start off 2 for 10 again.
"Big market is a is a dumb argument. Why don't the Knicks, Lakers, Clippers, or Heat win every year. The Nets didn't get Kyrie and Kevin Durant because they are in a big market. Kyrie will sell sneakers no matter where he goes . He went to the Nets because he was a longtime Nets fan."
Kevin Durant is a Brooklyn Net
"Harden is just about tied with Luka, while Dame rounds out my Top Ten.  Book is right around that range, too.  1. LeBron James 1. Stephen Curry 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. Kevin Durant 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Luka Dončić 1. James Harden 1. Nikola Jokić 1. Joel Embiid 1. Damian Lillard"
"bro. Kevin Durant and James Harden? ""Dominant Postseason performers?"" pls. Steph Curry is the best player in the NBA rn, pending how Lebron looks in the playoffs after that ankle injury. stop the troll."
Joe Harris best player  Kevin Durant the biggest snakey bitch in sports  Irving the fake woke Qanon conspiracist   Harden the biggest flopping bitch ever  The Nets buying a championship
&gt; What happened to AD?  he shot hot in the bubble and now he thinks he's kevin durant
Kevin Durant rolling in his grave seeing that shooting foul
Anthony Davis needs to be Kevin Garnett but he wants to be Kevin Durant
"Don’t worry, I remember perfectly, after that you classy gents cheered when Kevin Durant got injured!!!"
Lmfao Noone on the planet agrees that westbrook ever came close to Kevin Durants skill level ever once in his entire life. Even when Durant tore his Achilles he would've been more effective than westbrook today
is AD ever going to stop playing like kevin durant?
"There were people on our sub saying Brooklyn would've been a ""better matchup"" lmaool!! Yeah after Tatum just dropped 50 on us and Tobias damn near had 40, but we were supposed to believe that Kevin Durant vs our perimeter defense would have been a ""good matchup"" according to them. Hilarious"
Embiid is just Kevin Durant with 50 more pounds and DPOY level defense

"I’m ignoring facts? You asked why Durant chose the Nets and I told you why, he said [nobody wants to play for the Knicks ](https://www.sportscasting.com/heres-the-true-reason-kevin-durant-joined-the-brooklyn-nets/)  If your entire point is “wow we’re better run than the Knicks” then, congrats! Amazing!"
"It's fine to boo, not 10 years after something happened lol. honestly I'd be surprised if thunder fans booed Kevin Durant I mean it has been like 5 years let's all just move on"
"If Brooklyn had made its threes at regular season clip,  the game would have been a 25-point blowout.  Even if we erase the three shots affected by Robert Williams - who did a great job all-around - we are still talking about a 20-point game.  Game would have been out of reach by the third quarter.  Low likelihood that Brooklyn will have as bad a shooting performance the rest of the playoffs.  What was more impressive was the defense. Forcing difficult shots, lots of hustle plays, and rebounding.  In particular Kevin Durant really kicked it up a notch, and was really responsible for shutting down Tatum."

Lmao this is only because they had an abysmal first half. Good luck trying to get Kevin Durant to shoot 2-10 again..
"I don't think they said he's top 15. They just said ""He's Kevin Durant. We promise we tried"""
"There may be at least somewhat of an argument vs. Harden, but I personally would need to see Embiid lead a team on a deep playoff run first, he’s yet to really do anything in the playoffs. I know Harden hasn’t had ultimate success there either but the West is much tougher and he’s also been consistently great for longer than Embiid.  As for Durant, there is zero evidence that Joel Embiid is a better player than Kevin Durant. Zero. It’s hardly even a discussion yet, and very well may never be. This is one of the greatest all-time talents the league has ever seen."
"You’re right on all that but I just wanted to point out how it’s just so easy to say “let’s stop Kevin Durant from getting into a rhythm”. Reporters asked Pat Bev this one time in that clips/warriors series in 2019 and he said something to the tune of “KD is top 15 all time, we tried but Great players are great for a reason... we literally had multiple coverages for him and he still scored.”"
He's the same age as James Harden and younger than Kevin Durant
Fuck Kevin Durant 🐍
Kevin Durant is a very good basketball player.
I wasn't surprised because I have watched Kevin Durant play meaningful games before
"Kevin ""ZaZa"" Durant"
"Will be tough, he’s competing against an all around threat 7 footer in Kevin Durant, maybe on a lucky season he gets it"
Kevin Durant was also crazy cold to start the game
Kevin Durant selling out again!
"Been saying this, KD/Kyrie/Harden on the same team is crazy  Irving has the ball, drives to the basket but the opponent stops his drive so he dishes it out to Harden, defense scrambles but get a good close out so Harden passes it to an open Kevin FUCKING Durant   Bruh…"
"Hey well I suppose it’s better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green teaming up to destroy everyone? Lol."
I love that camera shot of Kevin Durant just chillin next to the basket lol
Kevin Durant looking like a stay away order interview
Lol the Celtics put a double team on Kyrie in the 4th to leave KEVIN FUCKING DURANT open for 3. This team is so silly.
"I laughed so hard when they gave Kevin Durant a flagrant foul on Jayson Tatum. The NBA has been a joke for over 10 years, and it's getting worse. It's why I rarely watch it these days outside of a Durant / Curry game."
I'm saying it would have just been a normal foul if the refs hadn't missed the Kevin Durant flagrant foul on the offensive end when he shoved Tatum in the face earlier on that inbounds.
“Kevin Durant” and “clown shit” are synonymous
Sorry to anyone who’s ever had to root for Kevin Durant as a player on their favorite team.  What an insufferable asshole in every way imaginable
I hate Kevin Durant. Not like my opinion matters haha. But he’s a bitch.
kevin durant makin dirty plays
"just chiming in, kevin durant a pussy"
"for real, does she expect him to lockdown kevin fucking durant?"
Kevin Durant is the best player in the world
celtics are living life right with some of the shots the nets are missing in this game.  just straight up rotated off an open kevin durant corner 3 on one possession and didn't pay for it.
Wtf. When did Kevin Durant get 29 points
"I think he's officially listed at 6'7"" too, so Luka's height is pretty much spot-on as we can get. He's no Kevin Durant who might be like three inches off from his actual height. Anyone would round up 6'6.75"" to 6'7"", and I'm not just saying that as someone who may not actually be 6'0"" and may be more 5'11.75"" myself and is kinda sensitive about it lol.  I'm curious about Cade Cunningham's actual height. Is he genuinely going to be essentially a 6'8"" point guard, or is he Luka-height and just including shoes in his listed height?"
"Not that I'm some kind of martial arts master falling wizard, but it's crazy that these are multi-million-dollar athletes and teams aren't investing in training guys to fall better. How many millions of dollars have the Nets put into Kevin Durant only for KD to risk breaking an arm if he falls like this?  Martial arts with throwing techniques like judo take the time to teach people how to breakfall as safely as possible. First day white belt children have to learn to safely breakfall before they can do anything else, and yet we can have super-athlete millionaire seven-footers reflexively throwing their arms backwards like this onto hardwood floors.  Pointless risk. It would suck if a player got seriously injured for something that could be more avoidable.  Straight up, like, each team needs to hit up their closest local judo/jiu-jitsu/aikido/hapkido/etc. dojo and hire them to give their players a one-day seminar on falling safely."
*Kevin Durant Be Thy Name*
Sometimes I forget how much of a huge fucking man Kevin Durant is
How much food — in cheeseburgers — Kevin Durant eat per day
Kevin Durant just went full Family Guy fall in this game y'all 😳
Anyone who didn't expect this is ignorant to what Kevin Durant and James Harden truly are at their core. A couple of number twos scared of being number one. Luckily Kyrie will bail them out and win the series.
Unless you’re Giannis antekouompo I don’t have the slightest clue on what to tell you on how to guard Kevin Durant.
"In the game thread and on twitter, there is a lot of talk about how PG13 was ""terrible"" and  ""gutter trash"" in this game. He was OK and he should have played better but people act he was played horrible the whole game. He had poor first half and a better second half.   PG13 is not a superstar like LeBron or Kevin Durant."
Why would Kevin Durant worry? He’s the best player on any court he steps on
"This is a cliche statement, but it truly applies to him.  There will never be another Kevin Durant."
"Nets starting lineup: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Joe Harris and Blake Griffin  💀"
"I never said he wasn’t the best player on that team, but you’re acting like he carried that team which is extremely untrue. That was a team win if there’s ever been a team win. FVV bailed his ass out a few times with clutch ass 3s and good rough defense on Steph. That year the Warriors sacrificed depth for an unbeatable starting 5, losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is NOT comparable to losing Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving. Especially when there’s no depth because you have 4 stars eating up cap space."
"Time for the Nets, led by Kyrie Irving, to begin their path to a title. He has a great #2 and #3 in James Harden and Kevin Durant."
Middleton is diet kevin durant
To me he's like a Great Value Kevin Durant.
Lol he loved Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant?
"Yeah the reason most small ball lineups in the NBA dont work defensively despite the idea of them sounding good on paper is that stating the obvious but size really matters inside even if it's not always super noticeable with how you structure your defense. Warriors just had nothing to stress the Grizzlies in the paint with X at the 5. Kind of what made Draymond unique the past decade being 6'5 and still being able to be the kind of rim protecting and general paint presence for it to work defensively. Also where vertical spacing helps, Kevin Durant in the death lineups was 6'11, Draymond when he was a 4 had a big to lob it to back in the day. Not that Steve Kerr runs many Steph/Draymond pick and rolls but even when he does just not the same when Draymond is that limited on the short roll as a finisher and there's so little inside to help space it.   Yeah the JJJ thing took balls, I had been calling for it but I didnt think Jenkins would do it to the degree he did. Brandon Clarke was the 2nd best rookie in the NBA last year where was he last night? On the bench, 0 min because he hasnt been good enough to crack the rotation lately. Same idea many wouldnt do that."
"There's nuance and context in every case. The cases where people got punished was due to direct contact to someone with confirmed covid, or being in an enclosed space during a time vaccine was rare.   Once again, if you steal a snickers, should you be punished the same like robbing a bank? Because that's what you're implying here.  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron james: Outdoor, vaccine/testing required ( all negative )  James harden: 50k fine and aSlap on the wrist after going from stripclub to stripclub.  Kevin Durant: Close contact with someone who tested POSITIVE for Corona  LeVert: Tested positive/Came in close contact  KPJ : Porter violated NBA regulations that prohibit attending indoor social gatherings of 15 or more people or entering bars, lounges, clubs or similar establishments.  Kyrie Irving:  50k$ Fine for violating BA regulations that prohibit attending indoor social gatherings of 15 or more people or entering bars, lounges, clubs or similar establishments and seen without a mask.  If you can't see the difference then I don't know what will"
"I’ll take Lakers LeBron, Warriors Curry, Utah’s Rudy, Brooklyn’s James Harden and Kevin Durant.     Everyone else can be protected now"
He was terrible in the short roll this game and has been when teams trap Curry with playoff intensity. Kicking it to the feet of a corner shooter doesn’t cut it unless that shooter is Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. His defense is championship material though.
"What would you describe as ""luckier"", acquiring Chris Paul or Kevin Durant?"
I said it last night I will say it again. When Kevin Durant left Russell Westbrook. Russ dragged OKC to the playoffs for three consecutive years with a much worse team in 2016-17 than this current years warriors team. Steph Curry hasn't made the playoffs without KD! Lol.
"He doesn’t look like that now  I’ve seen a vagina once, 26 years ago. Trust me, it does not look like Kevin Durant"
It was worse than that.  https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/ny-kevin-durant-quarantine-car-masks-20210206-y4y52l5dynb6decymm74xad5ne-story.html
"Ah yes, NBA Superstar Caris LeVert who has been competing for the title of best player in the league against the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard."
"In their first full seasons without Kevin Durant: Westbrook won MVP, averaged a triple double (first player since 1962), and made the playoffs. Curry missed the playoffs.  Westbrook best teammates were Oladipo, Kanter, Roberson, and Steven Adams  Curry best teammates are Draymond, Wiggins, Poole, and Oubre.  I didn’t count last year for Steph as he wasn’t healthy, but he played 65/74 available games for golden state so I’m considering this a full season for Curry."
"Grizzlies could have the most difficult finals run of all time, having to go through Steph Curry, Donovan Mitchell + Rudy Gobert, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Lebron James and Anthony Davis, to meet up against potentially James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  The West is fucking nuts."
"i didnt the mods did  here:  I've seen so many people putting him over LeBron for current best player this year, when he's not even above Kevin Durant (both currently and all-time). If Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were hurt in the 2012 Finals (like Kyrie and Love in 2015) and KD had Kerr instead of Brooks, he would not only have won the Finals, he would have won Finals MVP, something that Wardell Stephen Curry has never been able to do. Additionally, if you replace Kerr with Brooks in 2015, then the Warriors not only would have not won the finals, they wouldn't have even made it past Memphis (which is funny considering tonight)."
#WARRIORS BE GRATEFUL THAT KEVIN DURANT SAVED YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER'S LEGACY. KD &gt; CURRY AND ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE. 2014-15 WAS A FLUKE.
kEvIn DuRaNt iS bEtTeR
Curry showing he can’t win without Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant robbed us of 3 straight years of MVP Curry and I will never forgive him for that
Yall gotta stop making excuses for Draymond. I dont care how good his defense is… hes literally a liability and he literally told Kevin Durant that he dont need him lol
"&gt;Your argument relies on the Cabvs and LeBron just being completely incompetent  Yes! Because they were, that's the whole point. Those Cavs defenses, especially in 2017, were one of the worst in the playoffs and worst of a team that's made the Finals (like 22nd in the league?). Ty Lue is a bad defensive coach  That's the whole reason why their defense was stupid enough to leave Kevin Durant open for fastbreak finishes. It's not mainly because Steph is so great; it's because their scheme was wrong."
"Anyways why tf did Kevin Durant leave the Dubs? just to make another superteam? I thought he wanted to lead a team by himself as the main superstar, but now hes in the Net in another stacked team with 2 MVP type players lol."
"1 acl, 1 Achilles .. separate legs. He has said he doesn’t expect to be the same klay when he initially responds. I don’t anybody expects him to be the same defender (probably ever) but his offense game is reliant on elite athleticism so hopefully offensively I expect him to return back to (or close to) his old self.. similar to Kevin Durant this year."
Kevin Durant has a good personality
they had kevin durant come in a game then leave then come back and leave again on national tv. And then put him in 7 days protocol.
1. Kyle Korver 2. Domonique Wilkins  3. Paul Milsap  4. John Collins  5. Trae Young  6. Steph Curry  7. Kevin Durant   8. Giannis  9. Siakam  10. Sabonis
1. Dwyane Wade 2. LeBron James 3. Dirk Nowitzki 4. Kobe Bryant 5. Allen Iverson 6. Chris Paul 7. Hakeem Olajuwon 8. Kevin Durant 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo 10. Shaquille O'Neal
"https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-vs-jimmy-butler  Kevin Durant has averaged 29.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists in 10 games versus Jimmy Butler in his career."
Imagine trying to compare KDs finals run to LeBron's without any additional context like that.   Kevin Durant was playing with two other players who would go on to win MVP and another great player in Serge Ibaka. LeBron's second and third best players were Larry Hughes and Zydrunas Ilgauskas
"The Pelicans were one of the best teams in the league in 2017-18.  Anthony Davis finished 2nd in MVP voting and 3rd in DPOY voting, leading his Pelicans to the 6th seed in the West (arguably the most stacked conference of all time with the 2018 Rockets and Warriors), even after his co-star missed the latter half of the season with a torn Achilles.  He then averaged 33/13/1/2/3 on 65 TS% in a upset sweep of the 3rd seeded Blazers before falling to the KD Warriors, where he outplayed both Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  But sure, AD has never been that."
"&gt; I'd say either Karl Malone or Kevin Durant(Cheap, fake rings don't count)  ""*Well that's a very bad way to start a conversation*"""
Hey man very cool.  Does this compute In real time or have you already pre-computed and have all combinations loaded?  Seems like a good interview question - design most efficient algorithm to Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is the biggest bitch in the entire nba
"Fuck these refs, and fuck Kevin Durant for being a bitch"
"Your timeline is wrong and actually backwards. Kevin Durant signed with the warriors because there was a TV contract in 2016, so the cap went up $24 million. The Supermax was implemented to give teams more way to keep players like Durant, thus it being called the “Kevin Durant rule” sometimes."
The team that got Kevin Durant
theres not a lot of people that can do what kevin durant can do lmao  theres a couple
Kevin Durant almost fouled out of the last game and there was that borderline call that got reviewed and re-ruled a jump ball that could have been an early #5 for him (he picked up his actual 5th in the 4th quarter).   KD has actual defensive responsibilities now and I would not be surprised to see him either foul out of a game or be forced to sit/play soft on defense because of foul trouble in at least one game.
"""no chance KD can maintain that kind of pace for so long""  Fam, do you watch basketball?  Are you not familiar with Kevin Durant?"
"Didn’t you hear? Kevin Durant is a celebrity, so that makes it okay to be an asshole to women and surprise them on the spot by making them fight for your attention!  What woman DOESNT love showing up to a first date and finding out that her man has another date on standby in case he doesn’t like her? But KD is a celebrity so I guess that makes it okay!"
"Huh?   I’m just saying, being a celebrity doesn’t mean you can treat the women you take on dates as lesser than an average man would. That’s some real celeb worshipping BS right there.   This is an asshole move if the regular Joe did it, and it’s the asshole move if Kevin Durant did it"
That’s something I fully expect Kevin Durant to do.
There was the rumor he only wanted out in New York because he didn’t want to play with Kevin Durant when that rumor was out there
Right but Kevin Durant is probably the best pure scorer we’ve seen. He’s a 2K character come to life. I’m not changing the standards because one exception came out. It’s the same way it’s still not great to be 5’5” and make the NBA (even though Muggsy did it)
But Kevin Durant called him a unicorn. And everyone knows unicorns are good at basketball. Therefore Mavs should fire Carlisle immediately and replace him with KD and problem solved! He’s good at basketball again
"give KP the ball down low and he’s gonna do nothing but force up a middy regardless of whatever midget is on him and that shit will not win you games bc KP isn’t Kevin Durant efficient from mid....I’ve seen teams actually try to bait us into playing that way (Nets going small ball against us earlier this season for example). If you want KP to get himself a decent, efficient look it’ll literally have to be set up for him...and the only guy capable of that on the roster is Luka"
kevin durant.... with the bucket....  HERE COMES KYRIE....... shamet.... YES
Would you say Kevin Durant is a unicorn ?
There's only 1 Durant type player. Kevin Durant.
"other than Kevin Durant, I don't think we've seen such potential player (Luka obv counts as well)."
"&gt;He never had potential  He was [2nd on 2017 NBA GM survey](https://www.nba.com/gmsurvey/2017) to KAT on most likely to have a breakout season.  Durant's [nickname for him](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/01/26/thunder-knicks-kevin-durant-kristaps-porzingis-baskeball-unicorn) swept the league as ""[big men who are really skilled](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/10/7/20898587/year-of-the-unicorn-nba)""  &gt;and you can see it now  Not really what potential means.  Don't let the fact that he sucks get in the way of the fact that there was a chance of him not sucking at one point."
"&gt;Hes not built to post   Shaun Livingston could post up.  Kevin Durant can post up.  Heck, it's not like Dirk or even Hakeem were just backing guys down on the block."
"The square-cube law makes it crazier. What would Julius Randle weigh at Porzingis's height with the same proportions?       Randle_weight * (KP_height / Randle_height)^3 = Randle_weight_if_scaled_to_KP_height       250 * (87 / 80)^3 = ~322lbs.       Randle scaled to KP's height with his current proportions/musculature would be 322lbs. Again, KP is 240, or about 82lbs shy of that. Fun fact, this comes out to the exact same for Rookie Shaq at 7'1"" and 300lb if you scaled him to KP size.       For a fun reminder, Shaq recently said that in his last Laker title he was 395lbs at 7'1"". If you scaled 2002 Shaq to KPs height, he would weigh **424lbs**.         If you take 310lb, relatively well-proportioned Yao and scale him *down* to KP's height, he would weigh 280lbs.        So current KP, when adjusted for height per square-cube law, is:   * 40lbs lighter than Yao   * 82lbs lighter than Randle and Rookie Shaq   * 184lbs lighter than 2002 champion Shaq          He is the same weight as 6'10"" Kevin Durant, no height adjustment here at all. Both 240lb. So scaled up, KD would be heavier than KP.     Okay last one. Giannis is 6'10"" and 242lbs. His current proportions maintained at 7'3"" would have him weighing 289lbs. So KP is ~50lbs shy of a Giannis build, and again ~82lbs shy of a Randle/Rookie Shaq build, ~184lbs shy of 2002 Shaq build lmao"
"Harrison Barnes had a complete meltdown those last three games. If he would have connected in just one of those games and the Warriors won that championship, Kevin Durant would have never ended up in Golden State that off season."
also this:  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/19/nba-supermax-contracts-failure-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-bradley-beal-kemba-walker
Kevin Durant
"what adjustment can you make on kevin durant, they were triple teaming him at points and he still scored  middleton needs to play 500% better defense, he gets lost so easily.  jrue can't guard 4 guys on the perimeter at the same time because KD is collapsing your defense inside  guys have to do a better job fighting through screens because joe harris scorched them off a single high screen over and over, or they simply lost him trying to keep track of KD and kyrie"
"That's too bad.  This year's USA team could've been one of best one they had:    PG Steph Curry (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Dame Lillard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet)   PG Chris Paul (has shoulder injury, might skip if Suns plays deep in the playoffs)    SG James Harden (has hamstring injury, prbly want to rest it)   SG Paul George (might skip if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)    SF Kawhi Leonard (has motivation to play since he hasn't played in the Olympics yet, but might want to rest his legs if Clippers plays deep in the playoffs)   SF Kevin Durant (would prbly skip to prevent overworking so soon after his achilles injury)    PF LeBron James (prbly skip to promote his movie and heal up)   PF Anthony Davis (injured)   C Bam Adebayo (would likely play)      C Myles Turner (still injured?)"
&gt;Kevin Durant  &gt;Libra
I'm convinced some people doesn't know who Kevin Durant is by the way they talk about him.
"&gt; I'm not sure why people thought Milwaukee was better than a healthy Brooklyn  Because they think they're smart for parroting ""dEfEnSe"" incessantly as if any defence is gonna stop a team with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving."
&gt;Kevin Durant is not capable of carrying this team past the Bucks without his Superteam/Best player in Harden.  ????
"&gt;Kevin Durant - Oklahoma hero turned snake. Playing for Brooklyn Nets alongside 2 superstars     Lol, as if that Oklahoma org wasn't shit and he was carrying it on his back with brodie. Blame your FO for being idiots"
*Kevin Durant has entered the chat.*
"Huge Nets fan here, obviously we don't have the greatest interior defense. We do have Claxton who's so far in the playoffs and in the regular season has guarded Giannis very well. We also have DeAndre Jordan but he gets completely exposed on switch-offs and his lack of ability to guard the perimeter at all even to contest a shot. That's the reason he hasn't been playing. What it really comes down to is the bucks hitting shots. Something the Nets proved All season is that it didn't really matter how good your defense was, you just have to outshoot us. I don't expect the bucks to shoot 6 for 30 from 3 again, however to be fair I really don't expect Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving to shoot 25% from 3 again either."
Patrick McCaw has more rings than Kevin Durant and Hakeem Olajuwon
"If Kevin Durant, Jokic, Kawhi or Doncic was on the Lakers instead of Lebron against the Suns, Lakers would've won so yes he's not the best anymore."
Ok yea true I believe this is the same leg he injured during the season as well.  This was the problem with The Nets during the season too: one or more of the big 3 was injured. Kevin Durant has had quite a few injuries in the last few years as well.
TIER ONE  1. Kawhi Leonard  2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. LeBron James  TIER TWO  5. James Harden  6. Luka Doncic  7. Giannis Atentokounmpo  8. Nikola Jokic  9. Joel Embiid  10. Damian Lillard
"why, you think bogdan can defend kevin durant"
Kevin Durant has been less tested than Kawhi so far but he’s been absolutely ridiculous.  Jokic has also been less tested so far and has also been absolutely ridiculous.  I can’t pick between those 3.  We’ll see who stands up to the test(s) in round 2.
More like   Blake Griffin randomly dropped 18/14 with good defense after averaging 5/3/2 on 55 TS% vs the Celtics. Khris Middleton had an underwhelming game and the Bucks couldn’t shoot to save their lives. Giannis hitting 33% of all Bucks threes won’t cut it either.   But Bud has to play his big guns the vast majority of the game. There is no excuse for a Kevin Durant coming back from an Achilles tear to play 5 more minutes than Giannis and Kyrie 10 more. They have got to take advantage of the games Harden misses if he misses Any more.
kevin durant who ?
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to play 44 minutes and Giannis 34 minutes
I blame Kevin Durant for all these 7 footers thinking they need a jump shot
1. Lebron 2. Anthony Davis 3. Kyrie Irving 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Luka Doncic 7. Steph Curry 8. Klay Thompson 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Paul George 11. Jayson Tatum 12. Joel Embiid 13. Nikola Jokic 14. Damien Lillard 15. Giannis Antetokunpo  Honorable mentions:  Devin Booker/Chris Paul/Rudy Gobert/Donavan Mitchell/Jamal Murray. To say top 15 easy is laughable.
Refs missing some Kevin Durant type shit.
"Kevin ""Durant"" Huerter"
Why are they honoring Kevin Durant on the Sixers floor
I'm Kevin Durant you know who I am
"&gt;Historically, the 2019 Warriors nearly pushing the Raptors to a Game 7 without Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant would be the ultimate example.  This isn't ewing theory at work though. Ewing theory states that a team gets noticeably better when their star player isn't playing. That warriors team 100 percent was NOT better with no KD or klay thompson."
Kevin Durant hasn't had a single bad game when healthy. It's unreal.

"Difficult shots are not bad shots for everyone, and you think it's as easy as just *getting an easy shot instead."" That's not how it works. The difference between good players and elite players is the ability to make difficult shots because that opens up the game for everyone else. Otherwise, nobody has to contest as heavily  Harden making 35% of his heavily contested stepback 3s is exponentially more valuable than a guy who can only stand in a corner and shoot open 3s at 39% or get fed layups in the paint.. If you don't know why, then yes that is a misunderstanding of the game.  What do you even think is a ""bad shot"" for Kevin Durant?"
Yes you are the first person ever to make this observation about Kevin Durant
"That's not necessarily true, because when you play with greater players, you have less opportunities to score, you have to share the ball and don't have it in your hands all the time.  LeBron with the Cavs in 2018 literally had the ball in every single possession the Cavs had on offense and while that makes it harder, he has so many more opportunities to score or assist the ball that his numbers will naturally look incredible.  It's easier to be efficient when playing with Steph and Klay, but you don't have the ball all the freaking time like you would have in a worse team, so it's harder to put up raw stats. People also severely underestimate how easy it is to fit Kevin Durant with any superstar, LeBron/Harden need the ball on their hands to be effective, they aren't sharpshooters, the offense has to go through them, that's not KD's case."
"Well that was ballsy, but I guess he's Kevin Durant."
"giannis could average 40/15 and it wouldn’t matter because kevin durant, kyrie irving, and james harden are on the other team. but I agree, will still be a failure"
"No. KD signed with the Warriors in [July of 2016.](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-announcement/amp) The following year Russ was the MVP (and the Warriors won their first title with KD) and then [Presti traded for PG in late June of 2017.](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/reports-pacers-trade-paul-george-thunder) A few months later [Presti traded for Melo.](http://es.pn/2wOmKr7) A week later [Russ signed his extension in late September of 2017,](http://es.pn/2x2XnBY) about 14 months after KD left."
[Im basing myself off of this](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/)
No no that’s dumb Kevin Durant and draymond green Twitter logic. Logical fallacies out the ass there
"Did you not know about the social media burners? Most players are able to tune this type of stuff out, but not KD.   https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-admits-he-still-uses-burner-account-social-media"
"On another note, Kareem's fellow MVP winners were the likes of Cowens, Walton, and McAdoo. This was incredibly easy competition for MVPs and not at all comparable to future MVP competition like Magic, Bird, Moses, Jordan, Isiah, Kevin Johnson, Hakeem, Karl Malone, Barkley, Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, LeBron, Nash, Wade, Durant, Curry, and many more.  Bob McAdoo in 1975 was the only pre-1996 MVP to not make the 50 Greatest List. Since 1996, Derrick Rose is likely the only other MVP who would not make the 50 Greatest.   In 1976, Kareem became the only MVP to miss the playoffs. When the best player in the league can't make the playoffs - tells a lot about the league's quality. Likewise, when the best player of that decade in Kareem missed the playoffs twice in his prime something no other consensus top 10 player has done, that further confirms the weakness of the league's quality"
"Lmaooo prove himself?? It's Kevin Durant, yall know who he is."
"No and Yes. Front office team management who use analytics to make decisions understand that you're supposed to take that back court half-time buzzer beater, and they don't intend for their advanced stats to discourage winning play. Different ""advanced"" stats may encourage the wrong decision in this case.  As a stats-wielding fan, you're just supposed to take them in context and let other advanced stats combine to tell a more comprehensive story. True Shooting Percentage, for example, is an advanced stat from the perspective of a casual fan, an old head, media commentators, etc. If you want your TS% to be as high as possible, you don't take that shot. Then the media will report you as having an extra couple of points in the TS% stat they cite, and it may push you up the leader board.  The same is true for any box score based total value metric, like PER, win shares, VORP, Wins Produced, etc. Pretty much everybody has access to numerous stats that claim to be comprehensive measures of player value, but these are all based primarily on box score statistics at least for offense. That means that every single one of them discourages shooting half court shots at the buzzer.  Klay is (unsurprisingly) right to hone in on statistical plus-minus as providing the best information. The problem is that the best versions are not necessarily available to everyone. Even ESPN's RPM is proprietary. They just give you access to the results. The box-score stats can be calculated by anyone using just official league stats from one player to determine their value, not every possession in the league over the last several years to fit a statistical model of player impact to player minutes.   Kevin Durant is in a position where what front offices think of him is irrelevant. Every single general manager and team president in the league agrees he's a max contract player. His basketball life gets better when the fans and the media thinks he's better, but they are very likely to fall into the trap of accepting just the box-score based value metrics and shooting stats at face value."
"It really is common sense, you have to match your best players minutes with the opposing teams best players. Especially when it’s Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the other side."
Kevin Durant confirmed good at basketball
"Two things:  1. That’s about as embarrassing a loss as MIL could have had. Tons of rest and prep, no Harden, and they got blown out.   2. Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA, and everyone just ignores him. It’s so weird."
Almost like having Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the same team as you makes it easier to play basketball.
Make fun of him all you want but at the end of the day Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players of all-time.  He just out-dueled a two-time MVP in his prime despite coming back from an injury that ended many careers.
He’s Kevin Durant—a top 12 player all time. No idea why people doubted him.
kevin durant fouled out of this game in the 3rd quarter. someone tell the refs.
"Man, this sucks. Giannis has been a more efficient scorer (16/24, 2/5 from 3) than fucking Kevin Durant (12/24, 1/4 from 3) so far and his team is getting absolutely smoked."
"it's impossible to be ""overwhelming favorite"" if your rival team has Kevin Durant as a player"
Without Kevin Durant and Harden they aren’t… even with kyrie that’s a top lottery team…
"New flash: A team with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Joe Harris, and Blake Griffin is still really fucking good."
"I feel bad for you guys. Hopefully Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving can carry you guys past the Bucks. I believe in the Nets though. Even as the clear underdogs, they can win out through heart and determination."
"Kevin ""The Hardest Road"" Durant"
Coach Bud is a shit coach. The Nets were running a small ball lineup with a 4-foul Kevin Durant and he doesn't run a single pick and roll.
Kevin Durant should've fouled out by now!
Kevin “cast iron skillet feet” Durant
How the hell do you call the arm on Kevin Durant a foul but when Durant gets an arm on someone else it is fine. His hands weren’t even straight up
OH MY GOD KEVIN DURANT
Imaging thinking there is someone who is better at basketball right now than Kevin Durant
If nobody got me I know Kevin Durant got me
Motherfucking Kevin Durant!!!!!!!
KEVIN DURANT
"""Fuck Kevin Durant"" - Lil B"
"Kevin ""Achilles"" Durant has more minutes than the Greek Freak"
"My wife walked in, ""has Kevin Durant always been that thin? He looks like a cancer patient"" yes honey, he's always been 7', 87 pounds."
If Giannis doesn't play nearly the entire second half the Bucks are going to lose. Coach Bud can't pull his sub-36 minutes with Giannis shit against Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"ladies and gentleman, this is Kevin Durant without a superstacked team, enjoy"
"If the Nets win this game, without James Harden, it would prove what an incredible player that Kevin Durant is."
Just play Giannis! He should not play fewer minutes than Kevin Durant! Its not that hard.
I don’t care what anyone says about assists and playmaking kevin durant is the nets best player
"While I agree with ur overall take, haaaaavr you forgot about Kevin Durant? Lol"
i do not like kevin durant
"The ""Kevin Durant being late to rotate helping at the rim"" count is at at least 4 so far tonight"
"Kevin Durant, there you go. I dmed my info. Thanks!"
Lmao Kevin Durant is the 2nd best player in the league ur on drugs
"No one is happier that Harden is out than Kevin Durant - it's now a win-win scenario. If the Nets lose he has a great excuse, if the Nets win he gets to pretend it's because of him!"
Kevin Durant and Frank Ocean
"Russ's USG% this year is actually his lowest mark since 2009-2010, and he's got a lower usage rate than other guards like:  -Luka Doncic  -Bradley Beal  -Donovan Mitchell  -Stephen Curry  -Devin Booker  -Trae Young  -John Wall  -Damian Lillard  -DeAaron Fox  -Zach Lavine   As well as front court players like:   -Joel Embiid  -Giannis Antetokounmpo  -LeBron James  -Kevin Durant  But hey, keep shouting nonsense into the wind. We need more jokes around here."
Funny coming from a fan of the team that cheered because Kevin Durant got hurt
Kevin Durant. For some people I think its deeper than Basketball/NBA
&gt; Are there any other closer realistic players comps that aren’t Kevin Durant?  No lol he’s a 7 foot 80 pound shooting guard with shooting ability and court vision. Hard to compare him to anyone really

Kevin Durant is that u
[Kevin Durant says he speaks with Klay Thompson a couple of times a week](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2021/02/14/kevin-durant-says-he-speaks-with-klay-thompson-a-couple-of-times-a-week/).   I was shitposting but I think they are actually tight.
"Hold up, are you implying Kevin Durant *isn’t* a superstar with this comment?"
"The scouting report would say he has shades of Kevin Durant to his game. He'll need to refine his offensive game to work in the modern NBA, but his ability to rise up and shoot should translate into the pro setting. Less certain, however, is his ability to hang on defense. A classic tweener, Durant will need to bulk up if he intends to defend power forwards on the regular."
"I mean there's daily debates on major sports Networks if LeBron James is the greatest player of all time, so I think it's fair to say he's passed some of the stars of the past, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are pretty much both thought of as top 15 all-time, James Harden depending on who you ask is the third or fourth greatest shooting guard of all time, and that's just how eras work, one crop of stars is always going to break through that's why the top 50 list from 1996 has absolutely been destroyed ( and I don't think they got it fully right back then either but that's a different story) , because even then a lot of those guys had to pass somebody"
"Thinking back to that legendary Clippers post game interview where Bev and Lou had to explain to a ""sports reporter"" why Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant."
"That's dumb.   &gt; No one's coming to ~~Portland~~ Golden State to stand in the corner and watch ~~Dame~~ Steph jack up 40 footers all night  Oh, wait... Kevin Durant did."
"The East is so royally fucked if KD and Harden are healthy, it's not even funny.  I love me some Giannis and Embiid, but neither have shown that they can will a squad into the NBA Finals and that was before there was team in the East that was stacked.  Last time i saw Embiid in a high stakes series he averaged 17 ppg on 37% FG to lose in 7 and we all know how Giannis flamed out in the last two years, now they are playing against freaking Kevin Durant with Kyrie and Harden as his sidekicks."
“He’s getting paid the max but he doesn’t look like Kevin Durant to me!”
He’s Kevin Durant....yall know who he is.
"*Stephen A Smith Voice: ""*Are you telling me that Kevin Durant can't bring himself to grab a single offensive rebound in 36 minutes? *36 minutes?!* Not one offensive rebound. This man is a 6 foot 10 inches tall. Nuh uh. Nuh uh."""

So what's irrational about it?  There's nothing irrational about being excited for Kevin Durant being on your team lol
You’ll have a hard time convincing me a rookie Cole Anthony is a better playmaker than Kevin Durant
"&gt; He had Embiid along with Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.       Thoughts guys? I'd personally be putting Giannis, Kawhi, Harden and Jokic all before Dame. Lillard is in that back end top 10 with AD and Luka for me."
"yes Kevin Durant is ""underrated"""
"A valid point, but consider this.  Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant is about to do that. Currently at 55.3/47.2/87.8 with 27 games under his belt and 9 games to go while averaging 27.6 ppg I must add. He shot 10/10 in the last 2 games. If he does that over the next 3 games, he'll reach 90%."
"Jason Kidd changed the whole Nets culture while guys like Kyrie Irving were watching as kids. There is no superteam today if it wasn't for him.  In the same way that the All-Time Warriors team has Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Chris Webber etc... but Steph Curry is obviously the team captain. The All-Time Nets have Dr. J, KD, Harden, Vince Carter, etc., but Jason Kidd is the captain."
Kevin Durant during the 2012 Finals:  30.6/6.0./2.2 on TS%: 65.0%
"Absolutely not. Giannis is not the most dominant player when it matters in the playoffs because hit impact can be limited by good defensive schemes. Kevin Durant, on the other hand, is unfuckingguardable and can get you a bucket whenever you need it."
Is Kevin Durant
People really forgot who Kevin Durant is.
Kevin Durant is good at basketball.
Kevin Durant would NOT be in actual tears. His resistance towards hecklers is some of the most unmatched in sports!
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant doing Kevin Durant things. Props to Alize for that monstrous 20/20 game as well.  GG Pacerbros!  Glad to see Caris LeVert playing stellar basketball for you guys. It sucks that your team is really hit with the injury bug right now. Best of luck for the rest of the way.
"He's known as a Top 15 player all time, no Kevin Durant is not underrated."
Kevin Durant is good
Kevin Durant would be in actual tears
"FWIW Thon Maker was a top 10 pick and super hyped. Called a Kevin Durant/Kevin Garnett hybrid.   Bol Bol had a super famous father who was quite literally the tallest player to ever play in the NBA. I get your point in that physically unique players get more recognition than not, but those two examples are a little different.   I think Poku has quite a bit of potential and is a fun player to watch, but he's sort of a /r/nba user's wet dream. Tall awkward white prospect who wasn't a lottery pick and is on a bad team. It makes folks feel cooler about liking him than a more polished product/prospect.   I hope he pans out! I just think /r/nba specifically is going to focus on a player that looks like the majority of the user base than not."
I mean he kinda did diss Westbrook  https://www.sbnation.com/2018/4/23/17272808/kevin-durant-instagram-russell-westbrook-like-twitter-burner-account-nba
"Well talent-wise absolutely, and impact wise Steph Curry is one of the three most impactful players in the history of the NBA        However a lot of their accomplishments and things they didn't do are going to be held against them, so their careers aren't done but I look at Steph Curry what's going to cost him and his legacy is 2016, he has maybe the greatest season ever and then blew it in spectacular fashion which obviously leads to the slim Reaper, Kevin Durant is my favorite player in the NBA but going to Golden State is always going to be held against him, 5 years later and motherfukers still can't let it go lol, and even if they win the championship this year it's already been diminished in some people's eyes because of the addition of James Harden ( I'm not going to justify the silliness that people were talking about with the addition of the other role players they added) , injuries have robbed both of significant time.          I think if Steph can get this year scoring title and maybe another MVP there would be some people willing to put put him in the top 10, in the case of Kevin Durant had they been able to finish a three-peat I think that would have worked better for him in the historic long run but he's in Brooklyn now so the best thing Kevin Durant can do for his legacy is out play LeBron James in another finals if they do indeed meet again and have the decisive 3-1 Advantage there but I still don't know if that gets him into the consensus top 10 with all the other guys you mentioned, and another MVP or scoring title wouldn't hurt him either"
"He might've reached an NBA Finals if he hadn't tore his hamstring.  Also, did you not watch the playoffs last year? That Thunder team had no business taking the Rockets to 7 games and damn near beating them.   Hell go back and watch Game 4 WCF 2018 4th quarter, in a game with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, old man Chris Paul was the best player on the court and won that game for the Rockets."
You don't have to have a ring to be a great leader.   Is Kevin Durant a better leader than Chris Paul? Is Kawhi Leonard a better leader than Chris Paul?
&gt;The first of many great battles between the 2 Kevin Durant disciples.  ?
&gt;Steph had to recruit KD because he simply couldn’t recover  Or because literally no team will not try to sign Kevin fucking Durant ? What a stupid take.
"&gt;Kevin Durant has his Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award Trophy on top of his Finals MVP trophies  So do we kevin, so do we"
Kevin Durant says hello
"&gt; The players you listed that would have been top 5 in 2012 would not have been top 5 in 2011. Wade, Lebron, Kobe, CP3, and Dwight  I think there's a typo in what you wrote, but many of those players now are playing at a higher level than Dwight has ever played (Giannis and AD are both easily better than Dwight ever was, for starters), and higher than Kobe in 2011 who averaged a ho-hum 25/5/5 on 55% TS.  &gt; This would be the top 10 in 2010-2011 time; Kobe/Lebron/CP3/Wade/Dwight/Dirk/Duncan/Rose/Durant/Carmelo.  I used the year 2012 so let's go with that (it's slightly better towards the late 2000s as you get more into the prime of Kobe, KG, Duncan, Nash, Dirk, and others).  Duncan, Dirk, KG, and Kobe were clearly past their prime by 2012 (and had a much greater dropoff in production than, say, LeBron at a similar age).  &gt; Some notable guys left off the list include Rondo(lead Celtics to a 7 game series against 2011-2012 Heat), Chris Bosh, Griffin, Love, etc.  I don't see any argument that any of these players are anywhere near any of the players I listed.  Bosh, Griffin, and especially Love (who joined Cleveland at 26 in what should have been his absolute prime and then was instantly revealed to actually be a pure good stats/bad team player), are not as good as Giannis, AD, Jokic, and Embiid (to name the big men alone).    The early 2010s also included other all-NBA selections like David Lee, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Zach Randolph, Joe Johnson, Tyson Chandler, etc.  Tony Parker and LaMarcus Aldridge made all-NBA teams virtually every year during this timeframe.  Again, all perfectly fine players, but none of them are anywhere near the players I mentioned, and none of them had any significant success as the best player on their teams (not even talking about success in terms of 'titles' but even 'winning playoff series').   &gt; Also the pace and scoring was also just much lower back then  I do think it's easy for pace and scoring to inflate our opinions of some modern players (e.g. if you took Zach LaVine's stats and put them in 2012 he'd look like the third best player in the league or something), but everything indicates that many of the guys I mentioned are having much more impact on their teams winning than, say, LaMarcus Aldridge or Kevin Love or Chris Bosh were doing in the early 2010s."
"In retrospect the amount of talent in the league is a lot higher than it was in the early 2010s.  Sure, there was prime LeBron/Wade/Paul and the early part of Durant’s prime, but also a bunch of players who never got over the hump and players from earlier generations who were clearly past their peak.   In comparison, in the past few years LeBron and Durant have still been playing at a high level, and there’s also players like Harden/Curry/Davis/Antetokounmpo/Leonard/Doncic/Jokic/Embiid, pretty much any of whom would have been playing at a top 5 level in the league circa 2012 or so.   It’s possible some of this is availability bias — maybe we’ll eventually think of Damian Lillard like Kevin Love if he never wins anything, but Lillard is miles better as a player than Love was."
Remember when OKC fans said they would rather have him over Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is the most overrated fucking star ever jesus christ
"Yeah, we should have spent less attention to Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson to... seal off iggy lmao. The only reason we couldn't close a couple games was kyrie being a complete god damn head case."

"&gt; This dude told Kevin Durant ""we don't need you"".  They, as a team, didn't need him. He was right."
"Kevin Durant made a smart, adult career decision and people who criticize it are either narrative obsessed children or just salty his decision didn't help their team.  Also, despite taking the path of least resistance (a smart move) to a ring, anyone who claims KD has had it ""easy"" does not comprehend the training and effort needed to become KD and to get into a position to get the job offer he did.  He's not a robot or a video gamd character.  It takes work to be KD.  99.9% of people who say KD did it the ""easy"" way probably have never and will never work as hard for something in their life as KD has."

"Kevin ""The ~~Servant~~ Scouter"" Durant"
That game was wild Kevin fucking Durant had to calm Kerr down
"Youre really reaching for straws now huh? Players on all teams miss some amount of time, some teams skip practice, some players work on their games in their free time, others dont.  Being in ""rhythym"" is incredibly dependent on many factors outside of nba court time.  Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Demarcus Cousins all looked good on their first games back from injury, where was the rhythym there?"
Imagine getting kicked out of CSKA and then come straight to Brooklyn to help Kevin Durant win his first chip.
"Injuries are not something can be foreseen. We're talking about the Warriors when they were healthy. Like, no shit, having Kevin Durant on your team helps in any situation. But did they *need* him from 2017-2019? Key word being 'need'. He was a luxury for an already all-time great team.   And I'm pretty sure Draymond was fucking right considering that they literally did win without him, then had a solid chance of winning again if Klay Thompson didn't get injured in the Finals."
... That's not what he was saying. No fucking shit a team with Kevin Durant is better than that same team without him.   The question was whether or not they need Kevin Durant to win... as they won 1 ring in one year before him and won 73 games (and were 4 pts away from a repeat) in the next year
When healthy ( I know I know) Kevin Durant has been the best player in the NBA for the past 4 years
"It must be nice to not have to ever worry about hitting a draft pick.   Just trade away 5 years worth of picks for a couple of late 30's stars that ends up going down as the worst trade ever, then casually sign Kyrie Irving &amp; Kevin Durant in free agency a couple years later. Then give the Rockets hardly any value for James Harden because their owner refuses to trade with Daryl Morey."
Kevin Durant is extremely overrated and is not at all top 30 all time. The idea of Kevin Durant is much better than the actually player. He gets stopped in the playoffs easily unless the defense focuses on doubling Curry and treating KD like a role player
The chad reddit nba user vs the beta Kevin Durant burner
Pistol Pete and Kevin Durant
"He'd pick up a very good 3 point shot today, and also be a world class play-maker &amp; assist-man, have the dribbling skills of Ben Simmons and Dirk's fadeaway, he would have the offensive instincts of Jokic and the defensive instincts of a Ben Wallace/Gobert hybrid, with the agility of Kevin Durant and the strength of Shaq."
I cant believe Nurse sent a double at him at around 2 minutes left... It led to OG having to choose between guarding Joe Harris or Kevin Durant wide open on the 3 pt line haha
In a game with Kevin Durant kyrie Irving Kyle Lowry siakam and ffv MIKE JAMES was the guy who took over in the 4th.   I don’t wanna see the raps ever again gg
Did the raptors just help OFF Kevin Durant for two straight possessions?
Moses Malone-Center        Kevin Garnett-PF                Kawhi- SF          Kevin Durant-SG        PG- Chris Paul           I decided to up the ante and try not to use any top 10 players
"Im not using anyone I even remotely commonly see as top 5, so no Kobe, Shaq, or Hakeem either   PG - Steph Curry  SG - Dwyane Wade  SF - Klay Thompson  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Anthony Davis   Ridiculous defense, ridiculous spacing, with one of the best cutters ever to abuse it."
"Watch the national games.  For comedy and entertainment watch Inside the NBA on TNT.  If you see a game coming up with a great player, watch it.  You'll catch nuggets of wisdom on why they are great from the better announcers.  You will also see at least a couple of spectacular plays every game where you wonder how they managed to do it.  Watch for the players, coaches, and owners that interest you since we don't have a team in Seattle currently.  I personally like watching the Spurs because of Coach Popovich.  I like Coach McMillan's defensive coaching, and he's Mr. Sonic so I'll watch if he's coaching a game.  I'll sometimes turn on a Mavericks game because Mark Cuban is interesting.  If I see Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron, Curry, Damian Lillard, Harden, or some other great I'll stop and watch it.  Heck I'll even turn on Sabonis because I like his dad or Robin Lopez to watch his hook shot."
"What exactly is a good team to you then? Comparing any of his teams to the 1 recent year of the pistons making the playoffs with a 41 and 41 record is not even comparable.  Russ has never had a season at .500 or below ever in his career other than his first season, the year him and Kevin durant were both hurt and now this year. You keeping stretching your goal post over and over. First it's ""none of the teams were good"" which is technically wrong. Comparing his 10 years of playoff births where his worst season was with a mvp James harden at 44 wins. Finishing 5 times above 50 and 4 times above 47 to a pistons 41 and 41 appearance in the east is laughable. Then you stretch it to ""he's not anyone I'm going to tell my grandkids about"" ok? Who cares what you tell your grandkids about basketball players.   The only time other than this year that russ has had a chance to ""lead a team to a super star without an mvp"" are the years the warriors had kevin durant. After that he was paired with another mvp named james harden.   Of course the teams led by russ with no other mvps he had no chance of winning, nobody in their right minds would pick the thunder after losing durant to the warriors over the warriors with Kevin durant.   If you mean ""none of the teams russ IS on have a chance of winning a title"" then that's a fair argument. His playstyle is not imo championships caliber. But cmon, the only time he didn't have an mvp besides this current season is when kevin durant joined Steph curry klay thompson and draymond....nobody but lebron and luck could stop that. That is not russ fault."
PG- Lebron James   SG- Steph Curry   SF- Kevin Durant   PF- Tim Duncan   C- Nikola Jokic   6th Man - Jason Kidd
sign and trades exist. even the warriors got DLO for Kevin Durant.
"The only team he's been on that's done well??? He's been in the playoffs 10 out of his 12 years. Of those 10 he was in 4 conference finals, 6 semi finals. The 2  years he missed 2 of those had kevin durant on the team. Of his 12 total seasons (not including this one bc it's not over) he's made the playoffs 3 out of 3 times without another mvp level. Yeah he may not have gone far but to say none of the teams has done well is being completely false. Also the 2 years he missed the playoffs one of those was his rookie year the second time he missed 14 games at the beginning and Kevin durant missed the first 17, then another 6, then the last 27.  If you want to be  completely honest russ has never even been on a bad team until this year and his rookie year. To go even more at length, russ has only been on a losing team (less than .500 record) 2 times in his entire career, once his rookie year and this year now.  You can talk about his decision making being terrible, his shot being awful, and that he's selfish and arrogant, but there is absolutely no need to lie and say he's never been on a good team outside of an mvp.  EDIT:  tried to fix some terrible spelling"
How did that end up working for Giannis in a playoff setting? Got completely shut down the second he ran into a title caliber squad.   Meanwhile Harden was going toe to toe with the same Kevin Durant who many were calling the best in the world. Dropping 35/6/5 on great efficiency vs a fully healthy Warriors.
"I don't really understand what you're trying to argue here. The Cavs got bailed out on getting 3 #1 picks and decide to waste one of them on the biggest bust of the decade. ""Lebron traded away the majority of that roster to make it a better team."" Obviously, lmao, they probably still don't make the playoffs and don't find a way to off-load Anthony Bennett. Crazy how when Kevin Durant left OKC, the team didn't immediately spiral down into a sub-20 win team."
"Third Team: Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaq  Fourth Team: Steph Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  Fifth Team: Ja Morant, LaMelo Ball, Jason Tatum, Zion Willamson, Bam Adebayo"
did you see the video where he interviewed Kevin Durant? def worth a watch
"Why does everyone forget about Boston's big three. Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnet, and Rondo is as much a super team as any recent team. Atleast Bron left a franchise who's owner had done nothing to give him legitimate chances of winning a title.  Even the way the Lakers got Kobe and Shaq can be scrutinized as much as Bron super teams. And I would only qualify Miami as a real 'super team', the 16' Cavs and current Lakers are fine. Davis was moving no matter what. What KD did with the Warriors and now with the Nets is by far more tampering. Although fairly comparable to Miami. But Harden, Kyrie and Durant all left contending teams, Bron left an organization that failed to bring him help.  It would be like if Milwaukee never obtained Holiday and Middleton, among others, and Giannis left in free agency. Would anyone have blamed him?"
"I think you're not understanding what I mean by brand. Kevin Durant went to Nets to expand his brand. 35 ENT, and any other endeavours. Not everyone has to be Michael Jordan or LeBron to expand their brand."
"Shooting Guards:  Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, James Harden  Small Forwards:  Larry Bird, Kevin Durant"
"You are just biased and are looking at it in hindsight with a closed mind.  Literally anyone in the NBA can get injured as everyone is a professional and has played basketball or another sport their whole life, so everyone has wear and tear on their body, even straight out of highschool.  If your medical staff says you're clear to play, you're clear to play after considering all factors.  Technically everyone is playing with injuries especially this deep in the season.  Ya he was out for 5 games but players have been out for months and reinjure on the spot like Kevin Durant, and other reinjure after being out a week, but long or short they were cleared to play by PROFESSIONALS.   I would much rather trust the medical staff than someone that is typing from their keyboard."
Kevin Durant and Porzingis play similar to you? Lol
"You fucking added Kevin Durant on top of a 73-9 team that just was up 3-1 in the finals. Quit playing it off as a ""free agency move"""
"Lol your acting like y’all added sum bum bench player! You added Kevin Durant, the 2nd best player of the generation, arguably the best scorer ever. To a team just won a championship in 2015, went 73-9 with a 3-1 lead in the finals in 2016, they were a Draymond foul away from repeating as Champs. Please save the bullshit and excuses for someone who just started watching basketball."
Kevin Durant gets less respect than Damian Lilliard
"Just commenting to say you were right. Sort by top - last 7 days, kevin durant liking the tweet is at the very top"
"Kevin Durant is not hated because of his play. He is hated because of his off court antics. I don't think people take things away from his game or appreciate how good he is. If people do that they are idiots. I don't like him particularly even as a Warriors fan. Not because he left GSW or that he joined. But because he's simply not a likeable dude for me. But as my friend said - he took the rest of the league as hostage by joining a 73-9 team. Which makes total sense that people hate on him for that.   Kawhi is just not exciting to watch. Everyone knows that he's elite. But put up like this. You have one game you can go to. You wanna go to a game to watch Giannis, Steph, LeBron, KD or Kawhi? Kawhi is for the purists. He's nowhere near as entertaining as the rest. Also is he hated?"
Kareem with Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant wouldn't join a Nets team that already have Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum &amp; Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
Kevin fucking Durant lol? Kawhi?
"&gt;**They could have** a starting line up with Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, and Kevin Durant   But they wouldn't"
"Exactly.   Even Kevin Durant, hell Carmelo Anthony too, would choose to get paid 1 million a year and come off the bench on a competing team than to stay with the SUCKramento Kings for 25 million a year."
"I hate to entertain this post but you forgot Colin Sexton. He was selected with one of Nets picks. To go back even further, we traded the 6th pick for Gerald Wallace. 6th pick turned into Damian Lillard.   So really its:  Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving , James Harden, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, and Colin Sexton"
"and it's weird that in a Dostoyevsky universe with Michael Jordan he would be more like Kevin Durant, so is there a KD in that universe too? what would he be? Maybe Brian Scalabrine"
"West champions since Jordan left the Bulls:  Spurs, Lakers, Lakers, Lakers, Spurs, Lakers, Spurs, Mavericks, Spurs, Lakers, Lakers, Lakers, Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs, Spurs, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Warriors, Lakers, ???  Notable players for these teams include Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Anthony Davis."
"Jellyfish are cool, but they only go with the flow without achieving a true dominant status. They body everything they meet, no questions there. Jellies are JACKED. But, for the most part, rather than being the best, they feast upon table scraps, similar to Kevin Durant. Therefore, while impressive, a Jellyfish is not the best animal."
"A couple things  1.) again, fuck the bulls for not drafting Porter when he slipped to them. So what he has to sit a year? What’s a year???? He’s a ‘My First Kevin Durant’!!! Idiots.   2.) my god what did who tell him before this game cuz he is throwing that thing up like the ball is on fire"
Could MPJ become the next “Kevin Durant”?
"A typo. Here’s from the article:  “Kevin Durant,"" Green responded. ""Nobody is impossible to guard, but he is as close to impossible as it gets."""
It literally implies that Dostoyevsky created Kevin Durant as a character. It literally makes no sense.  The replies aren't acknowledging the terrible grammar here. If he wanted to say that KD is like a Dostoyevsky version of MJ .... then that's what he should have said.  The editor goofed in not catching this travesty of a sentence.
"&gt;Kevin Durant is impossible to guard, but he is as close to impossible as it gets.  Can someone explain this to me?"
"LeBron was better than Kawhi in 2018 and again in 2020, but in 2019 LeBron was hurt so he didn't play. That doesn't mean Kawhi was better, just that LeBron was out with an injury. Just like nobody would say that Pascal Siakam was a better basketball player than Kevin Durant, they would just say KD was hurt."
"What have the Chicago Bulls done in that time frame? James Harden’s second and third options in 2017 were Eric Gordon and Patrick Beverly and they were up against Kawhi Leonard, Manu, TP, and Lamarcus Aldridge. Kawhi missed game 6 but LMA was still an ALL NBA caliber player. There’s a reason why the Spurs nearly broke the home record.There’s also a lot more to the 0-27 bs. Chris Paul was out and the refs made questionable calls and no calls that forced HOU to switch to perimiter over rim, of which one of the 3s during the 0-27 wasn’t counted when Harden drained a 3+1 over Klay but the refs called it as a foul before the shot went off causing the possession to reset. That shit changes momentum.Fuck you want him to do, take down Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Kevin Durant by himself? Don’t come at me with that bs."
"I think I'm more frustrated with the writer of the article than KD. After all, Kevin Durant is just an abstraction."
"Man it's like this for the whole article.  This is how it conlcudes:  &gt;Every time Durant shoots, the neurons firing inside him are the same neurons that have been firing since he was a boy — and when they fire he can feel the past and present pulsing as one, the action on this court merging with every other court he’s ever played on, with every court out there in the world, on every continent and in every timeline, and the backspins on all the balls are rotating in perfect synchronicity, and when the shot finally drops through the hoop all the shots drop through together, the whole vast catalog of shots that he or any other player has ever taken and made, all the way back to the very first ball that ever thunked into the bottom of a peach basket. And still, Kevin Durant’s galaxy brain rises, out of the arena, to heights where whole cities overlap, whole cities and their teams, high enough that everything starts to make sense, all ideas start to cohere, and running on an N.B.A. court is just running up the old hill, and he is sprinting in an official game but also sprinting through drills, and he has been working for so many thousands of hours that soon Aunt Pearl will have to come over to the rec center and bring him a sandwich — and he is already very high but is determined to go higher, all the way to the origin of everything, the place where all points converge, and then if possible higher than that, up to wherever an asteroid comes from.  Which is a damn shame because KD actually gave some good quotes I thought.  I get writing is subjective but I really think this style of journalism writing is so pretentious."
"T""here is an idea of a ~~Patrick Bateman~~ Kevin Durant; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable"""
"Chipotle's celebrity cards are such a good idea. The cost of a burrito per day, vs the social media posts and pictures of ""I saw Kevin Durant at chipotle"" is great."
"Seriously...nothing against KD but the over-the-top language in this article is wild:  &gt;it is impossible to say whether it will steamroll the entire league or lose narrowly in the second round or dissolve into chaos and go off the grid and turn up 20 years from now on a submarine in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. The Nets seem designed to raise deep philosophical questions about not only basketball but also life. What is a team? What does it mean to belong? What would happen if we took 17 alternate story lines and folded them up together into an origami swan with three heads and a beard?  &gt;Which means they are the perfect team for Kevin Durant. He has exactly the sort of transcendental galaxy brain that likes to rise up very high, and then slightly higher, to think about things like deep time and space rocks and the meaning of life. And the Brooklyn Nets are his galaxy-brain superteam. At long last, after all these many millions of years, Kevin Durant may have finally found his true basketball home."
"This whole article has some of the most over-the-top flowery language I've read.  I'm actually shocked at the comments on the NYT saying it's one of the greatest sports articles of all time.  Nothing against KD but seriously wtf is this:  &gt;it is impossible to say whether it will steamroll the entire league or lose narrowly in the second round or dissolve into chaos and go off the grid and turn up 20 years from now on a submarine in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. The Nets seem designed to raise deep philosophical questions about not only basketball but also life. What is a team? What does it mean to belong? What would happen if we took 17 alternate story lines and folded them up together into an origami swan with three heads and a beard?  &gt;Which means they are the perfect team for Kevin Durant. He has exactly the sort of **transcendental galaxy brain** that likes to rise up very high, and then slightly higher, to think about things like deep time and space rocks and the meaning of life. And the Brooklyn Nets are his galaxy-brain superteam. At long last, after all these many millions of years, Kevin Durant may have finally found his true basketball home.  It's just so overly dramatic.  I get that it's a fluff piece but the stuff about his upbringing and KD's own comments are good enough.  You don't need to call him a ""transcendental galaxy brain"" and ""MJ as a Dostoevsky character"" and the Nets certainly do not raise ""deep philosophical questions about not only basketball but life""."
"Just saying but last time nba stars pushed to play in nba playoff despite leg injury, it did not end well.  Brandon Roy  Blake Griffin   Kevin Durant"
"&gt;that the people writing to him aren’t actually writing to him. Kevin Durant, to them, is just an abstraction, a guy on the TV, a figment of their imaginations.  We should all take notes when we write on this sub"
"The point of my post is thats a really lazy narrative.  And how does “always” equal two years?  By that logic the team with the best record should easily win every year, no questions asked, otherwise its an outright failure.  Bucks barely lost in the ECF to the best team in the world that year.  I don’t consider that underachieving, I consider that a pretty damn good season and deep playoff run.  Congrats on being a fan of the latest Kevin Durant Superteam, I’m sure your championship will be much deserved"
"&gt;What Durant understands, he explained, is that the people writing to him aren’t actually writing to him. Kevin Durant, to them, is just an abstraction, a guy on the TV, a figment of their imaginations.  You do know people change right?"
"&gt;If Dostoyevsky wrote a character based on Michael Jordan, it may bear some passing resemblance to Kevin Durant  I tried, but even that doesn't work well."
"&gt;What Durant understands, he explained, is that the people writing to him aren’t actually writing to him. Kevin Durant, to them, is just an abstraction, a guy on the TV, a figment of their imaginations. So what they are doing is projecting onto him the pain or hatred or longing that they actually feel about real things in their own lives. This is why he likes to write back. He wants to show them that he is an actual human, just like them, with his own fears and hatreds and longings. He wants to connect with them on that level. Even the angry ones, he believes, have good hearts. Hatred, he told me, is just another form of passion, and therefore a sign that you’re really alive.  This is what turned the article for me. KD takes himself waaay too seriously."
Kevin Durant lol
"""If Michael Jordan were a Dostoyevsky character, he would be Kevin Durant"" might be the worst sentences ever written. I don't know if they don't understand MJ, KD, or Dostoevsky; maybe all three?"
"&gt;What Durant understands, he explained, is that the people writing to him aren’t actually writing to him. Kevin Durant, to them, is just an abstraction, a guy on the TV, a figment of their imaginations.   It's good he can compartmentalize like this, although I assume he's gone through some maturing to achieve this given the infamous burner accounts."

Or klay Thompson or Kevin Durant
"There’s another New York team they will milk, cause they were planning on milking them anyway  New York Times wrote some BS article about Kevin Durant and the Nets calling them the greatest team ever already lmaoo"
Every NBA player is on a higher pedestal than Twitter shit talkers. That’s not the reason people shit on Kevin Durant.
Maybe average nba players but trae young is literally a few inches above average American height and only 180 lbs. you see someone like Kevin Durant on tv and say “damn this guys skinny” but he’d fuck just about everyone in this sub up. Just because you’re an elite athlete doesn’t mean you can fight people
"I assume Bucks have 3 guys that can guard all of Kevin Durant, Harden and Kyrie in this “bucks in 5” scenario?"
Kevin Durant obviously.
"Porzingis for Kevin Durant, both are 7 foot shooting guards"
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
"They played:  Michael Jordan: 179  Luka Doncic: 11  Allen Iverson: 71  Kevin Durant: 144  Jerry West: 153  LeBron James: 265  Anthony Davis: 38  Donovon Mitchell: 27  Rick Barry: 74  Elgin Baylor: 134    In other words, 11 games is nothing. One bad game will drop him out of top 10. It's a lot harder to maintain the high scoring than just have a hot start...LBJ's average is insane with more than 3 FULL seasons (in number of games) of playoff games"

Brooklyn D&amp;D party  &gt; Do you want the tiny quicksilver thief (Kyrie Irving) or the burly crafty woodsman (James Harden) or the tall ethereal phantom (Kevin Durant)?
Noel made the classic mistake of not being Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant stepped out like that once. And the refs said 'fuck it play on'.
So instead I will let one of my other 47 twitter accounts write it for me  \- Kevin Durant probably
Kevin Durant
*Kevin Durant and Kyrie could never be the sole focus of the defense and win a championship
You don't think the Celtics have tanked in the past? Have a look at the 1997 and 2007 seasons when they were tanking their asses off to try to get Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant.

"Yeah, is he trying to accuse Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving of being racist against black coaches? It makes no sense"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie both have no idea what it's like to be the focus of a defense. It's absurd.
Kevin Durant.
The 2017-18 Warriors were the greatest team of all time and if there is a debate to be had it's not between them and the 1985/86 Celtics it's the 1990's bulls teams. Kevin Durant and Steph are both top 20 players(maybe even top 15 all time)Klay is the 2nd best(maybe 3rd best now) shooter all time and Draymond is a top 10 defensive player all time and top 3 small ball bigs of all time. Not to mention the timeframe of these players in the league. At the time Steph and KD were the 2nd and 3rd best players and Dray/Klay were easily top 30 players in the league. That Celtics team had one top 3 player in the league at the time and everyone else was a big drop off.   Also the debate over which had better teammates is pretty wasted because they both sucked ALOT. If you argued which was worse it'd have to be that Cavs team but only by the slightest of measures to the point it's not worth debating as it has no impact on the debate.

Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant. Only real contender is LeBron and I think his injury ruined him.
"Kevin Durant.  Even at 90~95% of what he was, Kevin Durant is an absolute stud. He scores at all levels with ease and defends decently enough at his position.  Giannis and Jokic are a close 2nd and 3rd."
"This is a pretty interesting article. It shows why Kevin Durant interacts the way he does online (in his words). It's also more of an artsy piece rather than some serious basketball analysis. If you're a fan of artistic writing and getting Durant's thoughts on deeper meaning of basketball, then you might like it.  If you're expecting serious analysis, don't read it."
All I would say to the Lakers is remember Kevin Durant.   Davis isn’t a free agent and the Lakers probably actually care about his long term health unlike the warriors with Durant who obviously knew he was leaving so didn’t give a shit if he played or not.
Y’all been saying that. Meanwhile he got us Kevin Durant and James harden and we’re title favorites.
"There like a Kevin Durant type and James Harden type away.   Shit, same with a the Magic and Twolves."
"so another form of ‘who are the true superstars in the league?’   That’s easy. In order:  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  I’d love to put Luka Doncic on there because I watch and really respect the Euroleague and how hard it is to win that ish. But no.  Any other name you’ll see or have seen mentioned here all have caveats, explanations, projections, ifs/ands ,wishes and whatever jargon they use to rationalize it.   Fact is, they are not certified."
"[Classic](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/5/7/17326080/brad-stevens-celtics-sixers).  &gt; There’s not a single general manager who would take Stevens over Giannis in a draft that includes both players and coaches. But Stevens is not that far off. He’s undoubtedly entered the top tier of coaches across all of sports. So what would his value be in a hypothetical draft that included players, coaches, and general managers, with all salaries falling under the same salary cap? &gt;  &gt; I’d take Stevens over impressive young players like Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram, which means he’s ahead of high lottery picks. I’d take Stevens over the Jrue Holidays and Steven Adamses of the world, which automatically puts his value in the $20 million range. I’d take Stevens over aging stars like Chris Paul and injured ones like DeMarcus Cousins. &gt;  &gt; Obviously, players like LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Giannis, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant would be selected first. And rising stars like Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Simmons would go ahead of Stevens, too. But are you really taking DeMar DeRozan ahead of Stevens? I don’t think so. &gt;  &gt; It’s tough to know where to draw the line, but there’s no doubt Stevens has proved himself to be one of the most valuable commodities in the NBA."
Dude what are Kevin Durant and James Hardens win percentages? Anybody can ride their coattails to an impressive win percentage they are two of the greatest scorers in history. It's what happens without them that is telling. It's like bragging about getting into MIT when your dad is on the board of directors.
Uh Kevin Durant ? James harden ? Mike James ?  How are you expecting them to compete with that

"bruh... they fucking climbed up to the 2nd seed.... WITHOUT KEVIN DURANT PLAYING MOST OF THE SEASON!!!   like people like to make the comparison of LeBron and Durant both playing on super teams...  But when LeBron is injured, all of his teams (including the Heatles) have literally had losing records.   With Kevin Durant - both the Warriors and now arguably these Nets, are fucking championship contenders *without* Kevin Durant!   Shit is actually sick."
"I mean I think I said it all in proper English so I'm not sure if I need to read it to you?  Rich Paul gave Lebron James oral sex to prove his worth in order to become a tiny man in that position. Rich Kleiman, while jealous of the fact that Rich Paul stole his first name, proceeded to offer Kevin Durant his rectum in order to retain a modicum of fame since he was otherwise only known as the creature from Sin City.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope I spelled that out better for you.  &amp;#x200B;  To add:  Look at you though, my friend! You clearly know English as you continue to talk about ""big tiddy bitches"" in pornographic subs. More power to ya. You na$ti boi."
It is kinda crazy how someone like Kevin durant will have this type of insecurity.
Kevin durant or kawhi if we talking playoffs
"Kevin ""totality"" Durant"
Fact that people criticize LeBron for creating superteams and don’t absolutely eviscerate Kevin “Frontrunner” Durant for literally only ever joining a team with a superstar or more on it is mind boggling to me.
"I genuinely think of the Sonics come back, Kevin Durant will go there at the first opportunity, too."
Kevin Durant wouldn’t allow a 24-1 run   Steph wouldn’t allow a 24-1 run   Harden wouldn’t allow a 24-1 run
"kevin durant looking at the big picture here, not just one season. that's why he joined a team that's lost hundreds of times"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie are a power couple lol.
"""I am a horrible and unbelievably bad liar"" - also Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant James Harden and Kyrie Irving amount for a win tbh
"KD on the grit n grind grizzlies would be fucking scary. They needed an iso scorer and my god KD would’ve made that team lethal.  Mike conley, Tony Allen, Kevin Durant, zach randolph, and Marc Gasol would have the #1 defense and prob still a top 10 or 5 offense"
What about a Portland trailblazers that drafted Kevin Durant. Or even Michael Jordan
Nobody has ever carried Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant and his underdogs.
Kevin Durant cannot be stopped. It’s absurd
Kevin Durant is the greatest player since Michael Jordan
"I get what Kevin Durant is saying about the Warriors being an underdog *franchise* because prior to Steph's arrival, I don't think many people paid much attention to the franchise at all.  But the Warriors definitely weren't an underdog *team* when he joined."
"Sam Presti became the Sonics' GM on June 7, 2007. Kevin Durant was drafted June 28, 2007. What steps did Presti take in 3 weeks than enabled you to use the pick you'd already earned before he was hired to take the obvious best player available?"
I can’t wait to here Kevin Durant talk about Brooklyn in a few years as a team with no star players going into the playoffs that nobody expected to win
Kevin Durant is the most uncompetitive player in the NBA and he is constantly trying to convince himself he isn't. No wonder the man has 46 burner accounts to agree with himself on the Internet.
"""I never line step cuz I'm not a line stepper."" - Kevin ""Phife Dog"" Durant"
Get someone to believe in you like Kevin Durant believes in his own narrative
"Assuming Zbo and Pryzbilla were still on the Blazers, picking Kevin Durant would have also worked out."
Are you trying to suggest it took some kind of special genius to draft Kevin Durant?
"""You the real MVP, Kevin""- Wanda ""Yes Man"" Durant"
"&gt;Durant came in one day to [a film session], he was the first one in film room. He walked up to Kyrie Irving and said, ‘What does underdog mean to you?’  &gt;So Irving went into some absolute soliloquy saying absolutely nothing because he didn’t know what kind of trap door any sort of word was. And then Irving said, ‘What’s it mean to you, Kevin?’ Kevin said, ‘Warriors.'"
[Kevin Durant to agent after leaving OKC: 'Why the f— did you let me do this to my life?' ](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)
"&gt;	What does this have to do with FMVP? KD had the better counting stats and advanced stats that playoffs.  Advanced stats? You mean PIPM/RPM/APM/RAPM (250 games)? The ones Curry decimates Durant in every single category in? Those ones?  &gt;	Kevin Durant is also not a dogshit creator, you don’t know the number of open looks his teammates had given how teams were worried about Durant’s scoring.  Well, if he’s not a **dogshit creator** (he is) why did he have multiple OKC series averaging a **thrnover per assist?** why, in 2019 the momment Curry went down, did Durant have a game with more **turnovers than shot attempts**?  Really makes you wonder why he doesn’t have the plus minus stats, he doesn’t have the increase in TS% of teammates, and he turns the ball over a shit ton when asked to create and ball handle.   &gt;	Dirk sonned LeBron on the biggest stage in their careers guess Dirk &gt; LBJ now  No you dunce. Lebron played like ass. So did Curry in 2016 and Curry’s ankle was fucked. Who cares? Healthy Durant with a stacked OKC roster with an all time creator in WB, an elite rim protector in ibaka and a stacked team in general. Durant, time and time again, couldn’t get it done in OKC. Wanna know why? Because **he himself**played like shit having Westbrook out creating him and turning the ball over less.   &gt;	Steph then went on to get sonned by LBJ, blowing a 3-1 lead, recruited KD to his team and lost both FMVP to him, lol.  Yes steph lost im not sure what you’re alluding to. Curry—when healthy—has never played like a role player like Durant has when he was the primary focus on the defense and asked to create. He just turned the ball over a shit ton and his efficiency plummeted below **leage average**  You start watching basketball in 2018 bud?"

"Best player and most valuable two different things sans Kevin Durant and James Harden, if you want a current example"
&gt;	So if Curry is the reason why they won 73 why are they the 10th seed with Curry this year?  Ya it’s almost as if the warriors are **one of the worst teams in league history** with Curry off the court and he drags them to top ten when he’s on the court. He has the worst spacing over the past years and he’s still averaging all time stats. Also his impact metrics crush Durant’s (like the do each year in and out in the regular and post season)   &gt;	Defense? Teams hunt Curry. They don’t hunt KD.   According to what? Your feelings? Curry grades out neutral to positive just like our dear friend kevin Durant   &gt;	End of story. I’m done here. KD clearly showed in 17 and 18 finals hes better than Curry  Try challenging your own beliefs for once. Maybe you’re wrong about this? Have you ever thought what happens in your head isn’t what is actually happening on the court?   Keep reading ESPN and pearly clutching a FMVP narrative when Durant wouldn’t have ever made the finals again in the west if he wasn’t Curry’s teammate. What did you expect?
Is this the guy that codes 2K? I swear every year on 2K it'll be like Kevin Durant or something wins both MVP and MIP
after watching Kevin Durant for years now.....I don’t think anybody needs to tell him how to score lol
"Its not like he had Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka or James Harden.  How can you expect to win a championship with those guys?"
"&gt;	They don’t try to shutdown KD because they can’t even if they tried.  Lol ya some Reddit clown like yourself clearly knows more than the coaches who outspokenly said Curry was the head of the snake.   KD got shut down year and after before he joined a 73 win team. Did you watch basketball before 2017? Are you really this dense?   &gt;	Harden got totally shut down in the 2012 Finals and Curry got shutdown in 2016.  Yes being the primary ball handler and playmakers for their respective teams. Something kevin Durant has never done when you go according to touches, dribbles per possession, passes completed, etc—you know: **stats** that show much he handled the ball. Why couldn’t his coaches trust him with those responsibility? Oh, right. Because he becomes a turnover machines against bottom ten defenses in the league.   Curry made the finals without KD twice, led two teams to greater than 67 wins and when you take out Curry during the durant gs run the dubs ran at a 40 win pace. Without Durant? Curry kept them firing on all cylinders at a **70 win pace**  Maybe rethink your perspective"
"floor raiser/ceiling raiser is meaningless stuff that talking heads use to sound smarter than they are. certain players have different skillsets and play-styles but its really a league where talent is king and fit is what brings teams over the top. but someone suddenly going from one situation to another isn’t becoming a “floor raiser”   like for example kevin durant when he went to the warriors didn’t all of a sudden go from a floor raiser to a ceiling raiser, he’s just better than the guy who was in his position before"
"No, KD just hasn’t accomplished anything impressive for a player of his skill level.   Curry won back to back MVPs, including the first unanimous MVP. Award or no, was the most valuable player on a finals team (probably multiple tbh.) Led the greatest regular season run of all time. Was a nut kick away from beating a great team led by maybe the greatest player of all time in his prime.   Harden won an mvp, almost beat the greatest team basketball has ever seen, and is clearly the most valuable player on a team consisting of Kevin Durant and kyrie Irving.   Kevin Durant won an MVP, choked a 3-1 lead to Curry, and won maybe the two most meaningless championships of all time on someone else’s already dynasty-level team.   And this is advance metrics and on/off numbers aside, which don’t bode well for him when compared to Harden or especially Curry."
"The author makes that point well in the article:  &gt; Westbrook has played with two full-fledged MVPs in Kevin Durant and James Harden. Paul George finished third in one of his seasons alongside Westbrook. In fact, it could be argued that outside of his 2016-17 MVP season, Westbrook has never even been the best player on his own team. Bradley Beal holds that distinction now in Washington."
You ever hear of a guy named Kevin Durant. Look at his prime years in okc
Kevin Durant
"My understanding is it's the same foot injury that Kevin Durant had a few years ago, so it'll be slow to rehab and gain back athleticism, it could be a lingering thing."
"Kevin Durant, LeBron to name a few who are still playing"
Steph and Harden are top 5 players.   BUT Kevin Durant is at least top 2 player 😅
"I would rank him higher too, but it's mostly a longevity thing. Curry's peak is higher but CP3 has played 50% more minutes and his prime is basically his entire career. I don't know how you can rank Curry higher unless all you care about is titles. But also CP3 is one of the all-time greats and is unbelievably underappreciated because he doesn't have a title. In this league, unfortunately all the fans care about is rings. Curry got drafted into a team that also drafted Draymond and Klay and then surrounded him with elite roleplayers and then also Kevin Durant. Also CP3 should have won at least one MVP, maybe more. If LeBron doesn't exist, CP3 is the best player in the NBA for a decade."
"I honestly don’t see how someone can watch playoff basketball, the truest and most defining part of the sport, and still choose harden over KD. Is there an argument that Harden is one of the best regular season players ever, sure. But he literally just isn’t as good as Durant as a player. Durant is just better and his game is better in the playoffs, AND, he just plays better in the playoffs year in year our. I don’t like either of these two, but i’m taking Kevin Durant over James Harden 10/10 times."
"Of course he was great in OKC, he's Kevin Durant. But you need to realize three important things:  1) He was objectively better on the Warriors. His Playoff TS% rose 8% and he scored at a higher volume.  2) He was playing on a team with an elite playmaker (Westbrook) but because Westbrook isn't quite on Curry/Harden's level, the duo never won.   3) Curry/Harden's on/off number eclipse KD's and if you ask Nets/Warriors fans, it is almost consensus that the most important player to the system is Curry/Harden"
Do you remember watching Harden play the Jazz in the playoffs? Now imagine if he also had Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving next to him.
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving vs Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Mike Conley.  Brooklyn in 4."
"It’s so funny tho. Whenever he mentions LeBron, you know it’s gonna be about his free throw shooting, how Kevin Durant hit the big threes over LeBron in his house in back to back finals, his Spurs blowing him out by a record margin in 2014, and Ray Allen saving his legacy. Also Kyrie hitting the shot of shots in 2016. And maybe Michael Jeffrey Jordan."
michael jordan and kevin durant
Real hate - Kevin Durant Troll hate - Lebron James
It’s a stupid thing that started bc people can’t bear to admit Steph is better. Being more important is being better.    Stephen Curry was and is better than Kevin Durant. You putting a qualifier on it and saying KD is a better player but less important makes no sense. Curry is just simply better
Kevin Durant. Some people act like the guy was a fringe DPOY candidate when he’s been above average on that end at best in his career and incredibly inconsistent overall
"I don't think why the Warriors suffer in a world with 90's rules. You can't go zone or send super hard doubles against KD or Steph. Now Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Shaun Livingston all get to handcheck on the perimeter? You have to keep in mind as well that KD/Klay/Andre are all very big relative to their position in the 90's."
"Shannon: ""Skip, basketball is more than just about scoring right? KD might be a better scorer but LeBron is still the better overall rebounder, passer, and defender. How can you be the best player when you are only good at one thing while the other guy is better at everything else? Stop it Skip.""  Skip: ""My turn! \*slams table, sighs, sniffs\* You know my history with Damian Lillard, I think he's overrated in terms of basketball but he's definitely the best player rapper, I'll give you that. With that said, thank you Damian Lillard for telling the truth!!! I have been saying this for years now Kevin Durant is the best player in the world right now. Do you remember when he first came back from his injury a few weeks ago he scored 17 pts in 15 minutes off the bench. And let's look at what your man LeBron James did when he first came back last week against the Kings? He missed the game winner. And now he's out again. A few weeks ago he tweeted 'A storm is coming.', what storm? It's raining cats and dogs at Staples because the Lakers are in a big trouble. \*Blah blah blah about LeBron can't hit FT\*."""
&gt;Any fairly decent offensive player  Well we are talking about Kevin Durant.
ah yes the decent kevin durant. are you forgetting about kobe and wilt lmao
"I fully believe Kevin Durant monitors this stuff too. At the end of the 2014 season he had 31.9 ppg as his average, then in the last game of the season he played 45 minutes and dropped 42 points to put him just over to 32.0.  At the end of the 2012 season he dropped over 30 several times in a row to put him at exactly 28.0 also.  This would fit his personality."
"Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid"

Kevin Durant ama when????  You know he wouldn’t not answer the joke questions.
"No, they’re gonna depend on James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving to score. You just asked who else they had.  KD and Harden are a guaranteed 30 in the playoffs. Kyrie is a possibility but probably closer to 25. Still don’t see your point. They have the best scoring team of all time on paper."
"Also, you're just never going to keep them out of the game. And people don't wanna see natty athletes anyways. I don't want natty runningback's in the NFL that are 5'10"" and 170.

Amphetamines in baseball in the 70s/80s, simple PEDs like deca and test in baseball in the 90/00s, and the complex things + HGH in the 10s/20s.       You love that Kevin Durant is still able to play at a high level? Cool, me too, and you should be grateful that HGH and what it can do for connective tissue growth and recovery. That's one of the main reasons he is able to be at the level he is, yet practically every other player's career before his was ruined by that same injury."

Deron Williams, Dr J, Buck Williams, Rick Barry, Drazen Petrovic, Kenyon Martin, Joe Johnson, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden. I know plenty about the nets they’ve always been a team I’ve followed.   They had a few bad seasons in the late 2000s early 2010s but as far as talent, the Nets have had a good chunk of the top 50 come through there lol.  Edit: forgot to mention Darryl Dawkins"
"Yes, it's called a Ring of Protection. It's an official strategy of the NBA.   The primary flaw with the concept is that if the Ring of Protection moves and bowls over someone, it's an offensive foul.   The Ring of Protection would actually work better with wide, stocky players like Zion Williamson and Kyle Lowry's butt, and then have a taller shooter like Kevin Durant who can see over stuff fine and has a high release point. With that, you can create wide open shot after wide open shot.  Unfortunately, it's like the granny style free throw. While it's the most effective offensive strategy in the game, the coach's are too pussy to do it in an actual game to avoid being teased by their peers. However, don't be surprised if Tom Thibodeau breaks it out in game 7 of the NBA Finals this year."
Kevin Durant Christ
There’s this guy named Kevin Durant you’ve probably never heard of him
"Kevin Durant is one of my favorite players, but I wonder if he works out at all."
You act like beating a team led by kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant should be easy.
He’s sharing the court with Kevin Durant. So yes definitely
but the nets also have kevin fucking durant lmfao
Giannis 'Kevin Durant' Antetokounmpo
"kj has been exposed as a creepy weirdo so it makes sense people arent high on him these days   anyway, i had it as steph, magic, isiah, stock, cp3, nash, payton, kidd, oscar, clyde, and iverson since i wasnt sure west counts but otherwise yeah, give me any of those guys over westbrook any day of the week. if we're allowed to argue around injuries then id probably take penny over him too. not to mention the fact that everyone except steph/magic never played with anyone who could score as well as kevin durant for 7 years (that length of time is huge). Who knows how much better they'd look with that kind of weapon to pass to."
"That's fucking pathetic lol. Guess you don't look at Larry Bird's rings either, Magic Johnson, Kareem? All these players played on Superteams. The Heatles, how many 'real' rings does Lebron have? When you look at all these things you just realize people just pick and choose what rings to value and de-value. Please do not say BULLSHIT about it being a drafted team or not cuz that shit makes no goddamn sense. Kevin Durant is a 2x Champion and 2x FMVP. If he retired in 2016 in your book then its good your book is not worth looking at."
"Oh it's real for sure. I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there. Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared. It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy."" My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard would like a motherfucking word … James Harden wants to speak to you too"
Kevin Durant?
marial shayok AKA Kevin Durant
"Nobody is impartial, everybody has biases. I get where you're coming from but you're wrong. I have thought this about KD since long before he came to the Warriors. I want to say Steph is the greatest player ever but that's not reality. Obviously nothing is truly objective but I don't understand why everyone seems to somehow think that who someone supports automatically must define their analysis and be the first point of call for criticism. Nobody can ever give me basketball reasons why Harden is better, they just assume I'm biased. If my flair was different there'd be no case to answer. Biases can make some difference (for instance I insist Steph is top 10 all time... It's Steph and Klay we plump for, fuck KD) but not in this clear a race.  As of 2014-2016, Thunder superstar Kevin Durant was the second best basketballer on earth. Some may debate that but that was clear reality for me as someone he was an antagonist for. Since then he's had some small negative points in that race (the move to golden state, to an extent, being a massive dickhead online, the bad luck of injury) but mostly more positives (finals MVPs, championships, yes he was on a superteam but he was THE man on it, general amazing play, the immediate quality at Brooklyn post long layoff).  As of 2021, Nets superstar Kevin Durant is the second best basketballer on earth. LeBron and KD are getting older so their margin is smaller, but they're still the guys in the end, when you peel back all the context and numbers. I have no doubt this consistently held belief is not some shallow warrior bias."
Is that Kevin Durant posting?
you mean the galaxy where he had a prime Kevin Durant?
"The saga of Kevin Durant, for one thing."
"You're talking about it as if these are normal new NBA players. If ANY franchise has a chance to take Kevin Durant, you take it. If any franchise has a chance to take Giannis, you take it. 2-3 years of players like that is FAR more valuable than the potential of Zion.  Zion is one injury away from being Greg Oden. Yes, he may become a superstar but if I was starting a franchise and I could pick whoever I wanted, an unproven second year player with zero playoff experience would not be it.  And Luka is still miles ahead of Zion right now.  So actually, no, you are objectively wrong."
"I disagree. Kevin Durant who people say is number #1 or #2 player in the world depending on who you ask, he has won how? Teaming up with 2-3 All Stars. What did Lebron do to win with the Lakers? Get Anthony Davis. Westbrook has been playing with young undeveloped players since KD left. Paul George was horrible in the playoffs and Melo never really fit. Let’s  put Westbrook on the Warriors next year and see what happens. Give him some shooters and watch him average 25 assists a game."
That’s crazy. I’m thrilled to see how long LeBron and KD can continue their streaks. Right now LeBron does not seem to stop and I think Kevin Durant can average 20 a game for his entire career...
Kevin Durant is playing basketball part time right now
"It’s because he’s zero threat to shoot the three. Morris, even though you wouldn’t know it, shouldn’t be a player you can leave wide open behind the three pt line.   The 4 spot is a lot different than it was 10 years ago. It used to be for guys too small to play center. Now it’s for fuckers like Kevin Durant"
Wall has been arguably a negative for the Rockets this year (and I love John Wall) and yes he has? Every single player on every team he's ever played on (except MAYBE Kevin Durant) speak super highly of Russ as a leader and how he gets the best from his guys. Top 20-25 range is debatable but I would put him there still
"100% true, as a matter of fact he even talked about this after he won the mvp award. Kd is 7 feet and couldn't even bench 185 pounds once because he never lifted weights in hs or college because his coaches were smart enough to not make him.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.complex.com/sports/2017/05/remember-when-everyone-freaked-out-after-kevin-durant-struggled-lift-weights-nba-combine](https://www.complex.com/sports/2017/05/remember-when-everyone-freaked-out-after-kevin-durant-struggled-lift-weights-nba-combine)  [https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/](https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/)  [https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-calls-nba-combine-waste-time-top/story?id=47338234](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-calls-nba-combine-waste-time-top/story?id=47338234)"
"Kevin Durant didn’t lift weights until he was already in the league either and he put up 20 a game, Mj didn’t start lifting until he got got beat up by the pistons a few years in a row and he came in the league averaging 30, this proves nothing lol."
"Kevin Durant didn’t lift weights until he was already in the league, he said his coaches never told him to lift weights.   My theory is they were too scared to tell him to lift weights in the event that he might injure himself because he was rail thin but massively skilled so what’s the point."
There’s no way Anthony Davis is a better player than Steph Curry or Kevin Durant.
"1.) That was posted in 2019  2.) No Kevin Durant on the list = It's not a good list, unless he's not qualified for some reason. Either way, Chris Paul is above LeBron. I think it's safe to say the ranking isn't very accurate."
They look the [same height](http://snotapwi.com/the-desire-to-make-giannis-another-kd-or-lebron/giannis-antetokounmpo-kevin-durant-lebron-james-free-agency/) to me.
"I'm probably just in a bubble. I knew Zion was hyped in high school and last year but my perception this year was he kind of faded and has become under-hyped/underrated.  I mean I'm the only one in my circle who watches basketball, and my general family, friends, coworkers, etc. never have any clue who Zion is when I bring him up. They know LeBron, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, but not Zion. I left out Luka because I'm sure their knowledge of him is only because of me, but the global market for Luka had to be massive."
"If you get your height from your legs + are skinny you just look taller. Not to mention a 7'5 wingspan. Kd is barely taller than lebron in pics of them together.  Also, Embiid got posted at 7', seems to tower over kd in any pic they are in together.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2733943-joel-embiid-says-hes-better-than-mj-in-kevin-durant-burnertwitter-joke  And in this pic kd is wearing sneakers and Embiid loafers lmao. So the barefoot gap would be even bigger."
I mean LeBron is definitely an amazing scorer. But come on now. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry exist. LeBron himself would probably say they're both better scorers than him.
Dynasty? No. Dynasty was Kevin Durant. The end. You can't call it a Dynasty when they lucked out with opposing team injuries in the first finals they won. Then the second at full strength they lost. Then KD gave them easy chips after.
He never was a top 5 player. Top 5 guys right now are  1. Kevin Durant  2. James Harden  3. Steph Curry  4. Giannis  5. Jokic
"Bad Boy Pistons, and you can throw the Kevin Durant Warriors in this conversation as well but I'm still going with the Pistons, when you're actively trying to go out of your way to hurt and injured people , that's what takes the cake"
"Argue semantics all you want but prime Kevin Durant is more valuable than Rudy Gobert, exponentially.  Ever since KD left Westbrook has won been a routine first round exit in 5 games. He has done less with more his entire career than Iverson.  Iverson wins a championship if he gets to play with Durant, Harden, Paul George and Bradley Beal throughout his career"
Plenty of players have made it out of the first round without Kevin Durant.  Donovan Mitchell as a rookie did it.  Against Westbrook’s team that had superior talent
Julius Randle braids  Russell Westbrook vs Kevin Durant
is kevin durant going to get suspended for this?
Shawn Kemp Gary Payton Ray Allen Kevin Durant Jack Sikma
Yes that’s what I was surprised by ! Skip pointed out that Kevin Durant came back from injury like he never left and lebron couldn’t do the same ! James is much better shape post injury than AD is ! 12 points is about 20 less points than usual
"Draymond is the new Kevin Durant. Just bitching to bitch. Anytime he gets to trash corporate NBA he’s taking it, real talk."
"You weren't the kd warriors because lebron and your heat got their ass handed to them by dirk and then the spurs. It wasn't because you lacked the star power that kd had. You have lebron and wade who to a lot of people were both top 5 players in the league. You had an efficient 24 and 12 guy in bosh who was a superstar as well. Hall of famers like ray allen came to be role players and hit the biggest shot in heat history. The heat were absolutely the warriors it's just that while lebron failed horribly in the finals kevin durant on the other hand dropped 35, 8 and 8 on lebrons head while shooting 55/45/90.. kd just a level higher than lebron in the. finals. Dirk two levels higher than lebron in finals"
You are severely underrating James Harden Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the same fucking team surrounded by pretty underrated depth
How much help does Kevin Durant need?
"The Nets didn't make him less effective He had 3 blocks, a steal, guarding every position, and was key to slowing down Kyrie. KD was going to get 40 regardless but you don't want Giannis to get gassed on that end especially when he was going for 50 on the other  Edit: ""They can't let players go off for 40"" It's Kevin Durant we're talking about remember💀"
I’ve seen doctors say that a big reason why Kevin Durant has returned to form is because of his longer recovery time. I think that’s going to become standard from now on.

I wonder if this has ever happened to Kevin Durant before. Like ever in his life has his JUMPSHOT gotten blocked
Game 1 and he plays a different role on this team. On the rockets he was the clear number 1 option. Hes playing with Kevin Durant so it’s not going to be the “same” harden
No basketball game is over when one team has Kevin Durant and James Harden.
Kevin Durant is still good at basketball.
 ah yes that kevin durant guy is very good
"Nets down 16, but we gotta remember James Harden and Kevin Durant are on the court."
Why has Kevin Durant only touched the ball like twice so far
"He's starting to get near the fringe 25 range as more and more greats come through. 10 years ago he'd be a lock for top 25, hell he'd be a lock for top 20 easily 10 years ago, but in that frame guys like Durant, Steph, Dirk, Giannis, Wade, Harden, Chris Paul have all created arguments for themselves to be top 25.   Top 11 is pretty agreed on, in some order: MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Bird, Magic, Wilt, Russell, Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Hakeem.  Then that means Barkley is going up against: West, Oscar, Dr. J., Steph, Durant, Dirk, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Kevin Garnett, Giannis, James Harden, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, Kawhi Leonard. That's 17 guys plus Barkley which makes 18, so you've got 18 guys competing for 14 spots. I think Barkley's got the argument over Pippen and Robinson and for now he's got the argument over Kawhi, Chris Paul and Harden, but it's all pretty close."

"I totally get what you're saying, but it's not about his value to the sixers it's about his value to other teams as well as their confidence in him as a long-term investment. If two teams would make a trade of x In April but then the events of June July August September and October made both of those teams reevaluate what X is, his value will depreciate.  You don't think at least one or two teams have watched how this whole thing has gone down, looked at how much he's owed, and felt turned off at the idea of investing a quarter of their cap sheet for the next 4 years in a player currently in the middle of one of the most public NBA fallouts in recent memory? If indeed his value is dropping, which I would argue it is, is because his market is shrinking in direct relation to his continued behavior.   It's one thing if he was a LeBron Kevin Durant James harden type transcendent talent but he's not. He's an immensely talented but flawed player that only a select group of teams are currently constituted to build a competitive team around.   Other teams who want him are going to have to make additional moves to set him up for success. I'm not one of those people that thinks Simmons is a bum. In fact I think he's immensely talented. But the nature of his game already created a reduced bidding pool, combined with a historically bad playoff performance, and behavior issues. So to start the sixers were already in a tough spot But the continued saga has not helped.   The nature of value is it is in the eye of the beholder. All it takes is one team convincing themselves that he is worth significantly more than what their competitors are offering to salvage the whole thing. And it very well could happen. But I think it's a fair assessment to say his value has gone down. A year and a half ago you guys would have had a legit bidding war on your hands if you had put them on the trade block.  Teams aren't offering a tiny fraction of what the sixers front office thinks he's worth because they're trying to bully the sixers or be mean to them. It's because the market currently decided that he is not worth a ton. If they thought he was he would be gone by now or there would at least be some quality offers on the table But from everything we do know that has not been the case so far.  I personally hope you guys come out of this okay. I'm never going to be a fan of players acting this way. If you want out that's one thing but not showing up to practice, and getting kicked out of practice is something else."

This is the logo shot.  https://youtu.be/ZCJ2bM7f-Hk  She hit a game winning 3 in her 3rd WNBA game ever.  https://youtu.be/UURARvnSMug  She also got a triple double in of her first games which only happened under 10 times in WNBA history. She owns the record for most triple doubles in NCAA history, women's and men's. They only play 23 games a season and men play up to 35.  No I'm not trying to say she's as good. I know they would get killed but WNBA players can ball now. I tried watching in 2004 because NBA ended and I needed a basketball fix and they were bad. Clanking the rim heavy. The stars like Taurasi were good though. And now they can all shoot, good form too. They also play very nice fundamental basketball, Spurs-like.  /u/jsmiley27  u/simpandemic u/-gredge-"
 Kevin Durant left OKC because his fiancé broke up with him. She was very involved in her church and found gay pornography on KD’s laptop and broke off the engagement. He moved to the bay because his lifestyle is was more accepted there.

"James harden, giannis, Kyrie Irving,  kawhi Leonard, Joel embiid, Kevin Durant, Luka doncic, jayson Tatum, Jimmu butler, Paul George, jokic, Chris Paul, lillard   The list can go on and on"
The 2016 warriors outperformed their scoring margin by a lot that year (San Antonio actually had a better net rating outside of garbage time). Believe it or not Kevin Durant did actually make them better.
It’s not 2020 anymore. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are back from injury so people aren’t clowns and have AD above them. Jokic and Embiid have made major improvements to their games while AD stagnated/got worse and Luka has gained more experience.
"...  they smacked lebron in 6. and then the next year forced lebron to be the bitch that he is in his press conference and begged adam silver to overturn his double tech into a flagrant on draymond, citing, ""i have kids. he said something you should never call a grown man... it's not up to me, it's up to the league.""  fuck outta here. lebron has a LOSING record in the finals. and kevin fucking durant aint the reason for that, buddy. LeBron is just a loser when it comes to that, so why tf did u bring up lebron here?   they won without kevin durant. theyd still be hailed as champions without kevin durant. kevin durant would not be a champion without the warriors. It's KD that benefitted the most, kid"
"People always say he benefited from being on the warriors…but he’s Kevin fucking Durant. They benefited BIG TIME from playing with him. How many players have outplayed Lebron in a finals series, not once, but TWICE? That’s a pretty big benefit to play next to a guy like that"
"Those players were way more efficient, wouldn't say they bricked as much  Early 2000s had brick machines allowed to take 20+ shots, Jerry Stackhouse once took 24 shots per game in a season, Kevin Durant hasn't done that"
"Today, probably Giannis, Kawhi, Matisse Thybulle, and Kevin Durant.  Maybe AD, LeBron, and Paul George."
Kevin Durant Slytherin

"Harden under the bus? He was great. He was only there one of those 4 times though. That's a fact. IDK how that's throwing him under the bus.  And Ibaka is good but he's never been close to an all star game. He's a good starter. It's like mentioning Steven Adams (also a good starter).  &gt;totally ignoring Kevin Durant who is for sure top 40, 30, arguably 20 or lower into the teens?  I mean... No duh teams THAT successful for an extended period of time usually have multiple top 100 players on them."
I think it is when you start stacking multiple stats. Like only player to average certain blocks and 3% was JJJ and Kevin Durant at one point.
"Milwaukee feels like a toss up to me and the other 3 I'd take Nets over (unless Morey really pulls something impressive out of his ass). What have Denver or Utah done to demonstrate that they could take down a team with both Kevin Durant and James Harden on it? Neither of them has ended up being a real threat to even make it out of the West so far. I mean I could see it happening this season but right now it takes some squinting, I don't see a reasonable argument for just straight up saying you would take either of those teams over the nets as of right now"

"Ehh not really. He was just taller and lankier which makes him look more athletic than he actually is. I like to call it the Kevin Durant Effect because he's the most extreme example of it. KD has a really mediocre vert for an nba player and pretty decent quickness yet nothing worth mentioning but I see people calling him a freak athlete all the time. He's a physical freak in that his length is insane and what he does with a basketball at his height is unheard of, but athletically he's very mediocre for an NBA player. Being lanky just gives the illusion of athleticism. Luka is stocky so he looks slow even compared to someone like Bird who was slow in his own right."
"Oh yeah, that’s true. But still, Kevin Durant is quite the player.   For example, in his second season in the NBA he averaged over 25 points on less than 19 shots per game. 42% from three as well. That’s quite impressive. Can you imagine if During his second season he was averaging, for example, only 16.6 ppg on 14 shots a game? And shooting just 31% from three while playing no defence? Imagine if Kevin was that much of a bum! It’s a crazy thought. That would be a bummy Kevin indeed.  And what’s worse, imagine if he was actually starting for his team while putting up those numbers! Just try to imagine how poverty stricken a franchise would have to be in order to actually start Kevin, who would have been destined to come off the bench, putting up such mediocre numbers. I would go as far to say that franchise wouldn’t win a championship in our lifetimes. What a depressing thought. It gives me the chills to even think about."
"For 1 game with the fate of the Universe on the line, I'd have  PG: LeBron James  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: ~~Andre Iguodala~~ Larry Bird  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Hakeem Olajuwon"
"The Phoenix Suns were better than any team the lakers faced the year prior. The hawks weren’t amazing but they were a great team, and Milwaukee themselves was injured for that series so it was still a very impressive win. The heat were one of the best round 1 teams a champion team has faced over the past 5 years, they were a crowder and an Olynyk short of their finals campaign, and bam and butler improved on their play in the regular season. The only reason their seeding was lower than usual was Covid protocols and a few injuries. The weakest opponent they faced was an injured Nets team, but even that team had a solid group of role players surrounding Kevin Durant, and a few games of Kyrie."
He still had fucking Kevin Durant on his team lmao
He’s still a transcendent offensive player. He can adapt to the rule changes and his step back is still unstoppable. It also helps that Kevin Durant is also on the floor to take more pressure off him.
"*shrug* if you say so.  Kinda funny saying, ""you obviously haven't watched through much of his prime.""   Then turn around and throw both Harden and Ibaka under the bus while totally ignoring Kevin Durant who is for sure top 40, 30, arguably 20 or lower into the teens?"
This Kevin Durant guy is pretty good at shooting
OP could have used Point per shot and made it more clear. Now you can see how KD is way  ahead the curve.

Kevin Durant and role players took the Bucks to a game 7 and lost by 5pts
"If we want to talk about Kevin Durant as one of the greatest scorers of all time, we have to give him some credit. The gap between him and Trae Young is clearly the biggest factor in determining the outcome of those two teams. Also, in this hypothetical scenario, the Nets would still have all the players they traded for James Harden."

Damn I didn't know the Grizzlies had the next Kevin Durant
Can you imagine? Kevin Durant and a bunch of role players wouldn't even be competitive against the Bucks..
"For real. We have:   Kevin Durant, James harden, Blake Griffin, Patty Mills, Lamarcus Aldridge, and Paul Millsap. That’s insane already"
"A lot of players were encouraging other players to not play in the bubble, and a lot of players opposed it opening; that's not a uniquely Kyrie stance.

The team would just be Kevin Durant and role players.
"Stephen Curry and LeBron James, as well as Kevin Durant, Giannis, and Damian Lillard."
Kevin Durant in shambles.
1. LeBron James ($111.2 million) 2. Stephen Curry ($92.8 million) 3. Kevin Durant ($87.9 million) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo ($80.3 million) 5. Russell Westbrook ($74.2 million) 6. James Harden ($62.3 million) 7. Damian Lillard ($56.3 million) 8. Klay Thompson ($54 million) 9. Paul George ($47.8 million) 10. Jimmy Butler ($47 million)
We will have surpassed the need for Kevin Durant. He will make Steph Curry redundant.
In my opinion kevin durant and giannis but that’s really it
"&gt;Journalists don’t fabricate the news 90% of the time.  You talking about actual journalists or sports ""journalists"" (aka, pundits in disguise)?  Because the sports ones make up shit all the time. How many times do Mark Cuban and Kevin Durant have to publicly call them out as liars on national TV?"
He's a good player for sure but he needs Kevin Durant to win championships
"Here's my list, including bubble players  Should be guaranteed (retirees listed first)  * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Dirk Nowitzki * Kevin Garnett * Dwyane Wade * Steve Nash * Jason Kidd * Allen Iverson * Paul Pierce * Ray Allen * Gary Payton * LeBron James * Kevin Durant * Steph Curry * Chris Paul * James Harden  Would be surprised if they didn't make it  * Giannis Antetokounmpo (not in the highest tier only because of age) * Kawhi Leonard * Dwight Howard * Russell Westbrook  I think should make it  * Dominique Wilkins * Reggie Miller * Dennis Rodman * Bob McAdoo  Youngest active player to consider  * Nikola Jokic (in the league for 6 seasons and has an MVP. Shaq only was in the league for 4 seasons before the top 50 list)  My Bubble  * Tracy McGrady * Vince Carter * Pau Gasol * Tony Parker * Dikembe Mutombo * Anthony Davis * Chris Bosh * Manu Ginobili * Chris Mullin * Chauncey Billups * Ben Wallace * Adrian Dantley * Alex English * Carmelo Anthony  Reggie Miller Group (active veteran players not good enough for this anniversary list, but might be good enough in 25 years after a full career)  * Damian Lillard * Draymond Green * Kyle Lowry * Paul George * Jimmy Butler * Klay Thompson"
Top 10 players of all time Kevin Durant joining the 73 wins warriors which consist of another top 10 players in all time in Stephen Curry.
"I agree with you, Rick Barry is better than draymond. But I wrote this with positions in mind. And I think Kevin Durant is a better player than Rick Barry."
"&gt;Or Iggy just wanted to play in California and it was his best option.   Or you could read the reporting at the time where he and Steph and Bob Myers all talked about it.   He and Steph had connected while playing together on Team USA. The two had talked about it in chapel with a third player ... who happened to be Kevin Durant, which is why a lot of die-hard Warriors fans thought we had a real chance at KD for over a year before he signed there."
I take the bucks.   If it's preseason westbrook the lakers have with A.d. promising to stay healthy for lebron.   Has anyone seen the nets front court. Kevin durant is the best defender.  durant was the best shot blocker on the team at 1.3 lol.   The bucks stacked up on shoots again and no kyrie to worry about it makes it way easier for them. Only the nuggets I see being a sneaker.
"Warriors: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Wilt Chamberlain, Rick Barry, Jordan Poole"
Rick Barry played small forward. And Kevin Durant is better than Rick Barry
"I mean Hakeem has an argument over not only Steph but basically over half of these guys ahead of him if you're talking peak.   He could be as high as 5 or 6 if you're talking pure peak. Hell, Kevin Durant who's above him on this list recently put him in his top 5 (https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-star-kevin-durant-ranks-his-top-five-players-nba-history)."
"&gt;The second is sadly Kevin durant warriors signing is the ultimate finese   How so? There was a large increase in the cap that gave most teams enough cap to add a max. It's not like they did anything special to open up the cap space. And their pitch was essentially ""would you like to take the easiest road? That's us!"""
I’m not Kevin Durant
I'm only doing past 20 years-&gt;   Play. Kobe to shaq dunk   Game-&gt; Lebron all 2016 finals. Or Terry getting under lebron in 2011 finals lol.   Signing-&gt; Kevin durant warriors to know the salary cap is going up and signing him.   Tim Duncan and Tracy McGrady 99% close to playing together if the owner was cool with Tim Duncan family being on the plane together.   Trade -&gt; pau gasol to the lakers is the ultimate finese. Also kawhi to the raptors.
As a raptors fan that was the biggest shocker seeing us land a top 5 player out of nowhere after just being first seed in the east.   The second is sadly Kevin durant warriors signing is the ultimate finese
"I like Jay and he makes some good points, but anyone in Kyrie's position DOES NOT get to dilly dally around while you leave the likes of Kevin Durant and James Harden on hold. Molly is right, the season is about to start and you're paid $30m (I believe) to play. Are you in or are you out? It really is that simple."
"Dude the fact that you think Westbrook is a good playoff performer isnt just laughable…it’s ridiculous.  He should have given more shots to umm….checks notes uhh…Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden, and Bradley Beal…oh nvm he’s a better scorer than them, right?"
Kevin Durant for LeBron James. Skip Bayless in tears and Twitter loses their collective minds
Kevin Durant really went from making big shots in the playoffs to this
Get every player he wants? You think he wants Westbrook and Deandre Jordan over Kevin Durant and Steph Curry? You're acting like he can just pick anyone to be on his roster.
"That draft had the coolest names in the lottery. Dante Exum, Marcus Smart, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Julius Randle, etc etc. Any one of those names could have been a superstar's name. The next LeBron James or Kevin Durant. Hardest draft to pick in imo. Just high potential names all around."
Everyone keeps saying this but they’ve got Kevin Durant and James Harden still lol
why y’all act like Kevin Durant a war criminal or something lol
I never thought I'd say this but I kinda feel bad for Kevin Durant for what he's having to deal with
Nearly lost to Kevin Durant alone with a busted up Harden. It’s not disrespect. They would have lost in 5 if Nets were at full strength as sad as it may be for everyone that really loves Giannis gettin his ring.
"Yeah, good questions bro.  so for instance, if I’m comparing across different eras, I try to adjust for pace. I cant just look at Larry Birds scoring numbers and compare them to Kevin Durant or whatever. It’s got to be apples-to-apples and Ima look at Per-75 POS numbers and Per-100 POS numbers   Relative efficiency is important for sure. I look at rTS% because I want to see how efficient you were for your era. Numbers without context are just numbers so I gotta do a little work on that end and stack your TS up against the dudes u was playin with. Being a 55% TS scorer in 2000 is much more impressive than being one today.   And ye, good point on playmaking. Assists cant capture playmaking. Assists are only a part of playmaking. That’s y it is important to watch the games. But there’s also advanced metrics to look at offensive impact. They’re not very perfect , i can recognize the flaws bro, but it’s worth lookin at   You can take a look at On/Off ORTG to see how players influence the offensive performance of they squad … that can be problematic n shi bc of lineups. you can also look at their ORAPM for the year which IG is way better than that OBPM box-score stuff .. but that’s also problematic bc of smaller sample size. But all the advanced metrics have they issues, just some do be better than others n i try to make use of them or at the very least look at them   i’m not saying Nash didn’t deserve his 2005 or 2006 MVP. Just sayin that him winnin those MVPs doesn’t mean he was anywhere close to being the best player those years . He was a good candidate n just happened to win them both, not sayin it was robbery   The reasons u listed definitely are why Nash won the MVP imo.   I know this off-topic but Personally, I got to disagree w/ his 06 MVP and would’ve rather given it to Kob or Bron b/c I think they was more impactful  Kob had a higher ORAPM and had higher On/Off ORTG difference. If you wanna be simplistic about it too,he was directly responsible for more points if you look at it from the simple weighting of PPG + Points from Assists. Nash was hella mor efficient from a TS% but his turnover rate also more than double Kob’s and he had a better crew around him  Just bc Nash’s value came from facilitating and Kobs came from scoring/gravity, dont mean Nash was more influential to adding to his teams win column … but i do feel like that’s how Media members read the situation"
"Hahhahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha  Curry's team blows teams out without him and this man is trying to use it as an argument for him  Hahahhahahahaahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhaa, that was pre Kevin Durant too lmao hahahahahah"
Kevin Durant so stupid choosing to play with kyrie over Kawhi Leonard 😂😂😂😂😂
"Kevin Durant is an absolute freak like MJ, Bron, Giannis and maybe like... Shaq... maybe missing a couple / few guys like this that are just unfathomable physical specimens (KD is the least explosive of these guys but among the most skilled of the absolute most skilled)  Bird, simply put, isn't, and he still wouldn't be if he were born and raised in a different era"
Kevin Durant RIGHT NOW is better than 80s players  Would Larry Bird with modern day training also be as good today or would Kevin Durant with 80s condition be as good then as he is rn? KD is pretty lucky he can even play rn after that Achilles injury
Didn’t Kevin Durant have something like that?
"kevin durant is a lot better at basketball than larry bird  i know the kids here that never saw larry bird will be like ""no way, KD is a snek""  truth is, bird played 40 years ago. Durant would shit all over the 80s NBA, because the competition was much worse, there were many more bums  there were some players that would still be good, like bird. but there were a lot of players that simply would not sniff the NBA in 2020 and were total stiffs"
I never knew Kevin Durant was a good basketball player until I saw this post.
Here's game 7 KD lol [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-game-7-stats-career](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-game-7-stats-career)  36/8/4 and 49% from three
"I agree it's not a redemption arc. He commented as recently as April that the Warriors felt like an underdog when he joined them. He's still delusional about his time there.  &gt; The organization never been a winning organization. When I was in the league, nobody liked Golden State. So, it felt still like an underdog to me. Because I’m looking at the totality of the franchise. I ain’t looking at what happened these last five years. You’ve never been a perennial winner in the NBA – from the 50s on up. So, I’m like, “Damn, that’s an underdog franchise to me. This feels good,” like, “Shit, this feels like where I’m supposed to be.” It ain’t L.A. It ain’t New York. It feel like where I’m supposed to be.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2021/05/21/kevin-durant-warriors-felt-like-underdog-franchise-when-i-signed-with-them/"
&gt;	He doesn’t do the flopping and foul-baiting shit that’s rampant in the league  OKC Kevin Durant practically invented the bullshit rip-through move.
Who do you think is more clutch? Kevin Durant or Scott Foster?
And by using 2008 instead of 2007 we’re strategically avoiding Kevin Durant as well.

Kevin Durant is probably a sleeper burner mod too.
I feel like Kevin Martin was the Kevin who had the rip through move change to an on the floor foul. Not Durant.
it does. its just the power of friendship with Kevin durant
"Well it was a fan rivalry more than anything , the NBA definitely wanted it when they did the puppet commercials, we didn't see it a whole bunch in the regular season because they were, in different conferences and we got so close to it in the finals for a few years, had it not been for Dwight Howard, The Big Three Celtics, Dirk Nowitzki and then finally Kevin Durant , we could have had it at some point 😂😂"

"The biggest offender was probably Kevin Martin, though Durant abused it a lot as well."
Kind of like Kevin durant
"No, Kevin Durant was carrying his team. Played ridiculous minutes, Harden playing through a grade 2 hamstring strain and not even close to the level he is usually at, Kyrie out, Joe Harris shooting terrible when he the best 3pt shooter in regular season. Nothing but props to Durant"
Kevin Durant is ready to join this ultimate super team.
"Historically speaking, Lebron James has willed teams to greater heights than Kevin Durant. That is true.   The rest of what he said was a little bit silly."
Kevin Durant can't even get out of the Eastern Conference Lebron did it for like 8 straight years.
"No, as Skip Bayless says, some people have the clutch gene and some don't.  And this ""Kevin Durant"" guy simply doesn't have it to the level of an Igoudala."
Kevin Durant &gt; Lebron right now and it’s not even close
"Gets better every year, only issue is Kevin Durant. Great player but the Dude has tasted the feeling of a superteam and he’s thirsting for more."
"I think he was hoping Embiid would play in ‘15-16, show some promise and they’d be able to sign some free agents. He was hiring coaches and support staffers who had connections to Kevin Durant. He was clearly trying to make a swing that summer, kinda like the Nets did in 2019."
"Draymond works because he’s been surrounded by the 2 greatest  shooters of all time and also had a guy named Kevin Durant for a couple years. Also he shot mid 30s from 3 on, and im not exaggerating here, 35 times as many 3 point attempts."
"I’d imagine they’d be in a better place. There’s a misconception that Hinkie only wanted to tear down his roster, but he was doing things like hiring assistant coaches and support staffers that had connections to big free agents starting with Kevin Durant in that 2016 class. That’s not to say Hinkie would have signed KD, but I’m pretty confident he wouldn’t have mortgaged a future first round pick to trade up for Markelle Fultz, and I imagine he would have been able to more organically add around this Embiid-Simmons core."
If this sub can have posts about Klay Thompson riding a boat it can handle posts about Kevin Durant playing basketball with and against other NBA players in the olympics. Imagine if this sub existed during the dream team run and no one posted about it lmao
"I wouldn't say never. There's been many great defenders who started off as poor defenders in the NBA. Marc Gasol, Kevin Durant, Andrew Bogut, James Harden (when he wants to), Klay Thompson, Blake Griffen, you could even throw Lebron in here. Most offensively elite young stars were never taught to care about defense. It's the offensive ability that gets them into the league. Usually it takes until near the end of their rookie deal for them to become solid defenders as they adjust to learning hundreds of defensive plays."
I can play for them off the bench if the guys in front of me are Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum
"He never really struggled, it’s just he’s never reached the highs of Kevin Durant"
"""So Team USA has got all times greats like Kevin Durant and James Harden, exciting young players like Devin Booker and Jayson Tatum, and...Kevin Love."""
"It’s his brother they’re worried about. Thanasis, who just singled handedly beat Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Steve Nash in a best of seven."
He has a great relationship with Kevin Durant
Honorable mentions need to include:  * Kevin Durant * Chris Bosh * Horford * Jrue Holiday * Chris Paul
the fact that Giannis gets more discussion of his FT routine than he does for going  40/13/5 in a game 7 road win against Kevin Durant and co is disappointing.
Kevin Durant is just so sensitive.  Toughen up dude.  You don't need to respond to fans like this.    It's pathetic.  You'd think he'd have better things to do.
Nets could’ve taken a time out. Inbounded the ball on a catch and shoot and still have time for someone to secure the offensive rebound to try tie it. I think they relied way too much on a clearly exhausted Kevin Durant to bail them out again. As bad as Harris was this game I’d rather have him take the final shot and have Clayton and KD in the paint to try and get an offensive rebound and put back. What a terrible way to end a series. Bucks have the Nets so many chances to get back in this game. It was a very ugly OT
"I recommend you start watching games and then following a few Twitter accounts to better understand what’s going on:   https://twitter.com/nbastats is a good one to start with.  You can also follow websites that report on transactions, aggregate rumors and player statements without bias/alignment towards certain team bases, such as:  https://hoopshype.com  Finally, you can follow podcasts that discuss games, transactions, etc outside of games.  This is all deeply personal, in terms of taste and choice, but here are some recommendations:  *super opinionated and disliked by many fans* The Pod father Bill Simmons, has legendary interviews, such as a 5 part interview with Kevin Durant over the course of his career in Golden State (first interviewer to get him to open up about the Harden trade, etc). He’s also interviewed many reporters and ex players, respected in the industry.  No Dunks - used to officially work for ESPN, the first podcast to do a video channel, 4 funny Canadian/Aussie/Greek dudes that have a lot of fun, and generally keep it positive.  Woj/Lowe - official ESPN staff, respected in the industry, get a lot of inside scoop *although Lowe’s quality has dropped in recent years and he keeps going off on rants*.  Dunc’d on and Hollinger and Duncan podcast - used to be some of the nerdiest most stat driven conversation, deeply enjoyable analytics talk. I’ve stopped listening recently, but they still have a mastery over salary cap negotiations, front office insights, and advanced statistical breakdowns ."
"So why not use the same logic and penalize players who get free lanes to the basket because of spacing - aka Kevin Durant in Golden State? Just like uncontested rebounds and assist hunting, these lazy drives to a wide open lane shouldn't count, either, right?"
"Passing is good. But what these players do is assist hunting. They hold onto the ball for 20 seconds on the shot clock to try and fish an assist. I think a lot of times this hurts their teammates development. A lot of times great teammates have to turn into spot up shooters so these super star can assist hunt. Porzingiz on the Mavs for example has turned into a spot up shooter. People often complain that guys like Lebron and Luka don't have great teammates. But maybe a big reason their teammates aren't doing so well is because Lebron and Luka are way too ball dominant and make their teammates spot up shooters. Their teammates need a good feel for the ball to be effective. Of course it will be hard for their teammates to get going when their superstar holds onto the ball for so long. A better offensive scheme is something like the Warriors or 2014 Spurs. Where everyone has a chance to hold onto the ball. Tons of ball movement. You also look at Kevin Durant. He is so easy to integrate onto any team because he doesn't need the ball that much in his hands to score. Him not needing the ball so much in his hands to be great also makes his other teammates thrive. Guys like Lebron, Luka, Harden however need to be ball dominant to be effective which gives their teammates less opportunities to thrive not having the ball in their hands as much."
"People are heavily underrating that Nets supporting cast.  Blake Griffin, Joe Harris, Landry Shamet, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green along with either Kyrie or Harden is an insanely good roster next to Kevin Durant."
"Sometimes, unfortunate but uncalculated injuries like that happen; you should know that from Solomon Hill.  Also, there aren't many teams historically that'd have beaten the Nets at full strength, so I'm not sure why that should detract away from the Bucks' victory. They still had to beat the BITW, Kevin Durant, who had possibly a career-best series and a well-rounded supporting cast even without his costars healthy."
How is it possible to rank Curry before Kevin Durant? They're playing in the same era and it's clear and has been clear for years who is the best of those 2. Ain't no way.
"Wow, I’m thoroughly impressed. if English isn’t your first language, but you’re delving into the differences between “was” and “were,” you’re doing amazing. The vast majority of native English speakers do not even know how to use “was” and “were” correctly, so you’re doing great.   As you stated correctly, you typically do use “were” when speaking about hypotheticals (also known as subjunctive). The sentence in question, however, is in the “indicative mood” and *not* the “subjunctive mood.”  So your example — “If I were there, they’d win” — is correct because it is a “subjunctive mood,” meaning it is hypothetical or unreal.  Other examples of using “were” in the subjunctive are as follows (note: you *always* use “were” when using *wish* because it’s always unreal and almost always use “were” when using “if” because it’s almost always unreal):   * I wish I were rich as rich as James Harden, but sadly I’m not. * He wishes he were as tall as Kevin Durant, but he’s only 5’8. * If Ben Simmons were able to shoot, the 76ers would have made the Conference Finals.   So the important part to note here is that all three above sentences are in no way reality.  The original sentence is not subjunctive, however, because it’s stating a fact or what could possibly be a fact. OP is saying there’s the possibility that even before Harden joined the team, the Olympics were over because Team USA is so good, but now that Harden has joined the team, the Olympics are definitely over because Team USA is so dominant.  So the key here is that even before Harden joined the team, there’s the possibility that what OP was saying — that the Olympics are over — is already true. Because there’s the potential it’s true, we use “was.” The “if” just makes it confusing because *most* of the time “were” is correct following an “if,” but not in this circumstance.   Here’s some more examples using “was” with “if”:  * If Chris Paul was still showing symptoms yesterday, then he will be out for at least the next two games. * If Chris Paul was vaccinated but still got Covid-19, then he’s very unlucky. * The only reason the winner of the Hawks-Bucks series is unknown is because we don’t know if Bogdan Bogdanović was injured in last night’s game.  In these sentences, there’s a distinct chance of it being factual, ergo “was.”"
Kevin Durant palms every time he dribbles
"Steph Curry,  Klay Thompson,  Kevin Durant,  Lebron James,  Draymond Green"
Milwaukee looked like dogshit until Kyrie got injured midway through game 4. They beat the hospital Nets in 7 and now all of a sudden they are this unstoppable force for us? We don’t have Kevin Durant but we have depth and defence which the Nets don’t have   Hawks in 6
The team that went 73-9. Then added Kevin Durant. And you’re making excuses for them. They lost and it wasn’t even particularly close.
Worse max contract performer in the postseason: Kevin Durant or Ben Simmons?
Kevin Durant should’ve been in this
"&gt;Ultimately, at least in today's NBA offense trump's defense. You need dudes who can get buckets to close out games.  I agree. But just to add, I don't think that's because defense is less important than offense necessarily.  I think it's because top offensive players are better at creating shots than defenders are at stopping shots.  I mean, a point is a point. It's just as valuable to score one as it is to prevent one.   But short of reliably forcing turnovers, there's probably a limit to how much a defender can stop a shot whereas there isn't really a limit to how much someone like Kevin Durant can get a half decent shot up."
It was stale because Kevin Durant ruined it. Warriors/Cavs was shaping up to be an all time rivalry before he signed there
There's been no player hated and harassed more than Kevin Durant. It's obviously unfortunate but it's just indicative of current toxic behavior between media and fans.
Meanwhile Kyrie's out there playing video games with Kevin Durant and getting nosejobs instead of supporting his team in a game 7
"Yeah but he was already Kevin Fucking Durant at that point. It’s one thing to get hate when you know you’re good at your job and there’s no clear evidence of that hate affecting it - it’s another when you’ve visibly got the yips already, and then the world takes a shit on you."
I’m pretty sure Kevin Durant would beat Ben Simmons into shooting and teach Conley his ways of surpassing injuries.
"Why does Kevin Durant who has 2 FMVPs, 2 Titles and a reg season MVP give a shit lmao"
"Also, yeah, let's not ignore that both Warriors titles came when Draymond was important to Steph....and the Warriors also had - drawing a blank here - oh, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson."
"I'd say so because if you choose to drive, the big rotating off Nurk/ Rolo is less afraid of the perimeter threat than the big rotating off Kevin Durant or Blake Griffin"
"Trae Young is no Kevin Durant.  But you are right, we'll see how it plays out.  I loved the way Atlanta played, it will be a nice serie."
"They let JJ go to. JJ could at least spread the floor for them. And then to think they had guys like saric as well they all let go.. philly just a mess. I always say don’t overpay for athletes if they’re not Lebron, Kevin Durant, etc high caliber, don’t give them max money. It’ll only hurt your cap space. If you’re cool with being mediocre then by all means"
"LeBron admitted it was tough on him the first year in Miami I think.   And Kevin ""arguing with 14 year olds on Instagram"" Durant is definitely insecure or at least used to be imo."
This is a straight up lie. Kevin Durant does not have alt accounts
"Kevin Durant is probably the best we have now -- awesome player, only plays on completely stacked superteams, uses twitter burner accounts to trash his old teammates."
"Dirk also didn't play a Portland team missing LaMarcus Aldridge (Lakers - Anthony Davis), a Lakers team missing Pau Gasol (Denver - Jamal Murray) or a Thunder team missing Kevin Durant (Clippers - Kawhi). On top of all that, Paul may get to the finals and avoid the Nets or the 76ers. Milwaukee or Atlanta, no disrespect to either, would probably be one of the easier finals opponents in the last 15 years."
"Steph Curry opted out after he heard Kevin Durant was committed to the team. Or at least, that's what I expect to hear on the next episode of First Take."
"This is mostly true.   &amp;#x200B;  JJ didn't the ""begging"" comment, but he was always going to leave.  Clippers were in cap hell the last year of Lob City.  There was no way to bring JJ back without him taking a huge paycut, which he definitely wasn't going to do.    &amp;#x200B;  The ""CP3 got mad because Doc played Austin way too much"" piece is just BS from the media.  This was cleared up later and CP3 actually wanted Austin to play more (he was a great backup PG for us).  &amp;#x200B;  Dudley part is true.  He got played while he was injured and sucked bad.  Hurt Dudley's reputation.  Annoying that Dudley is so upset about this, because he was always garbage while he was on the clips.  &amp;#x200B;  Josh Smith part is true.  Doc tried to play Josh Smith as a small ball center after the 14-15 season where we were up 3-1 then got destroyed by Josh Smith and Corey Brewer.  Doc doesn't know how to play centers and kept putting him against bigger centers, leaving Smith to get wrecked physically.  Also, he's a terrible 3pt shooter so this never was going to work out.  Josh Smith would've been a fine pickup if all he was doing was playing backup 4.  &amp;#x200B;  Barnes wasn't really just because of an argument.  Barnes got traded cause we needed an answer to Kevin Durant (lost to Thunder in 13-14) and the collapse the following year.  Picked up Paul Pierce.. obviously didn't turn out well.  Looking back, we would've been better off with Matt Barnes.  Not his fault he can't guard one of the most unguardable players in the league."
"That's not what he said man. He's said this nets season was more meaningful to the idea of kevin durant than his tenure in gsw, which i kinda agree with. We knew who he was when he went to gsw, which is also why it was a chicken shit move. But coming off an Achilles tear to do this has added to his legacy in a way the easy mode seasons just didn't. But no, it must be because everyone started watching ball two days ago and you've watched forever."
Kevin Durant also doesn't weigh 300 lbs. It's not like he's not a lot of muscle and you can't change body type.
"If they get Butler to commit, they can just run Miami’s offense for stretches of the game. I would guess it works a lot better when you replace Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson, and Trevor Ariza with Steph Curry, Devin Booker, and Kevin Durant."
OG Kevin Durant
"You're right, Kevin Durant and Giannis need to cut weight too. They were gassed in their series.   Seriously youre asking a dumb amount of a guy that played great. The loss isn't on him, he needs help"
&gt;If they hadn’t missed on two of those they would have won already  No one can possibly know that.  They probably would have just been smoked by the Kevin Durant Warriors twice instead of losing in the second round.
Find me 1 time Kevin Durant beat a team better than his.   1  0-6
"What star wants to go to OKC lmao. If Zion doesn’t like it in NOLA why would he go there? He wants to go to the franchise that couldn’t win a title with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and a prime Ibaka? Lmao."
Kevin Durant for a turd left in a toilet at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.
Kevin Durant for a soiled pair of pants. Can the Nets get more? That remains to be seen.
"LeBron went up against elite defences that were all purpose-built to specifically defend him. Boston and Toronto were top 5 defenses who's entire identity centered on stopping LeBron.  Which came about because he'd spent a decade dominating the East. Teams would gameplan their offseasons around him.   Durant, being new in the East, hasn't experienced that. KD went up against Milwaukee, who have a defence that emphasizes letting guys shoot.  LeBron was beating rock with scissors, KD was beating rock with paper.  &gt;Their role players had wide open shots and were bricking them  The Cavs were one of the worst shooting teams of all time those playoffs. LeBron still had them scoring against elite defenses. Joe Harris actually shot better than Kevin Love."
"As much as I respect the bucks, it took 7 games to beat Kevin Durant not the Nets lol"
Not recency bias at all.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover  KD has been the 2nd best player in the NBA for at least 7 years while the #1 best player is literally the GOAT(or GOAT runner-up depending on who you're asking).  The only worry was him coming back from injury and being able to produce and he quelled all our fears there with his performance in these playoffs.   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29105681/ranking-top-74-nba-players-all-nos-40-11  https://www.complex.com/sports/best-nba-players-of-all-time-ranked  He was also ranked in most people's top 15 before we even saw his return from injury this year and his performance in this playoffs.
"Kevin ""Durant"" Huerter"
"- LeBron signed with LA.  - AD forced himself to LA.  - Kawhi signed to LA.  - PG13 forced himself to LA.  - Kevin Durant signed with Brooklyn.  - Kyrie signed with Brooklyn.  - Harden forced his way to Brooklyn.   No big market biases eh? All in the last what, 3 years?"
"The Hawks have a few things going their way.  1. Coach Bud doesnt make adjustments and just tries to ride his stars in the playoffs. I dont know if he is just afraid to make his stars mad or what. 2. The stars of the bucks just take turns playing iso, even if its not going well. When one of them is playing well, then its great, but a lot of the time it isnt. 3. Giannis is a monster, but was absolutely in love with the 3 against the Nets. If he keeps taking 6 of them a game, that means he isnt in the paint. We like him not in the paint. 4. The Hawks bench is deeper.  5. The Hawks have shown that home court doesnt mean much to them. They are pretty dominant on the road in the playoffs.  Of course none of that means that this is an easy series, but it will go at least 6 games. I personally love the Bucks for beating what turned out to be ""Kevin Durant and some dudes he's with"", so even if the Hawks lose the series, I wont be mad at the Bucks."
They have the offense. Defense probably not. Giannis and Middleton are gonna be coming in with a lot of confidence after that game 7 knowing they can comeback on Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant hasn’t won in the playoffs without A LOT of help. He’s amazing, but you can’t compare him to a 2016-2020 Lebron who could win no matter who was playing with him, except against a super team of KD steph klay dray iggy and some other fellas."
"Anthony Davis- Yes  Andrew Wiggins- No, but not terrible either  DeMarcus Cousins- Body broke down  Kevin Durant- Yes  Russell Westbrook- Yes  Kyrie Irving- Yes  Blake Griffin- Body broke down  Stephen Curry- Yes  Paul George- Yes  James Harden- Yes  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Yes  Klay Thompson- Yes but injured   Karl-Anthony Towns- Yes  Andre Drummond- No  Bradley Beal- Yes  John Wall- Body broke down  Deandre Jordan- No  Jahlil Okafor- No  Dragan Bender- lol   Jaylen Brown- Yes   ———————————-  Pretty good set of predictions all things said and done.   Among the players whom they predicted wrongly, 3/5 are centers who were negatively affected by small ball(Deandre Jordan, Drummond, Okafor). Worth noting that both Jordan and Drummond made the All-Star team, All-NBA, and led the league in rebounds   Wiggins is a solid starter and 2nd star. He can still make an All-Star game eventually, but he isn’t the perennial Star they predicted   Dragan Bender was a bust"
"Bruh they still had Kevin Durant playing his best ball of his career. Don't act like just because they didn't have two other stars completely healthy that that didn't have anything. The nets were obviously the clear favorite if fully healthy, but thats a big if. Trae young is nice and the hawks have a good supporting cast, but they don't have a Kevin Durant."
He’s held more than his own against Kevin Durant in the playoffs multiple times so I’m not sure why he couldn’t do the same against Kawhi especially being that he plays amazing defence on Kawhi m in the regular season already.
kevin durant? lebron james? harden? kyrie? paul george? do you have the memory of a goldfish
"in fairness to doc...  * blake griffin has also never made it past the second round despite being teamed with chris paul, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick, james harden, kevin durant, and kyrie irving  * chris paul has only been to the conference finals once on a team with james harden, and missed it on teams with blake griffin, deandre jordan, old chauncey billups, jj redick... and james harden.  * joel embiid has never made it to the conference finals despite being teammates with jimmy butler, al horford, #1 pick ben simmons, #1 pick markelle fultz, that big scary serbian guy, and a revolving door of shooters including seth curry, danny green, tobias harris, jj redick, marco ""the confetti cannon"" bellinelli and doing it all in the ""weaker"" eastern conference  * paul george is in his third conference finals, despite playing two years with the indiana pacers while being coached by frank vogel, neither of which are considered a good thing on this sub in recent months.  * kawhi leonard has made so many conference finals i lost count.  idk if it's doc's fault fellas!"
"60s: Bill Russell and the Celtics dominants the decade winning 9/10. Wilt Chamberlain sets amazing records unbroken to this day.    Important players: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West  70s: Rough decade, several teams win championships. Kareem emerges as the best player.   Important players: Kareem Abdul Jabar, Pete Maravich, John Havelick, Julius Erving and Oscar Robertson  80s: NBA starts to become more popular.

Kevin Durant joined the warriors in 2016, after losing to Currys Warriors, and to the dismay of many NBA fans, helped the warriors win the final two championships they won in decade.   Important players: Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Chris Paul and Giannis Antetekumpo."
"Lots of bad comments, wow.  Ok a basic rundown.  60s era NBA was very different because there was the NBA and the American Basketball Association, the ABA. Eventually, the two merged into just the NBA. Back then there were like 9 NBA teams and the Celtics dominated with Bill Russell. Wilt Chamberlain was the other behemoth that ran around and poured stats. Theres a YouTube channel called Wilt Chamberlain Archives that has lots of great stuff on Wilt and Bill.  After that we had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the Bucks and he's the current all-time career point-getter in the NBA. He had a crazy skyhook and eventually went to be a Laker. There were lots of other stars I'm kinda skipping over in this so you're gonna need to read up. I honestly think that playing the NBA2K games can be a good entry point to learn because they have a ton of classic teams. Anyway when Kareem was a Laker they drafted a rookie named Magic Johnson and he and Larry Bird from the Celtics tore ass through the NBA in the 80s and are credited for saving the NBA because it's ratings in the 70s were really bad.  Late 80s, Michael Jordan gets drafted 3rd by the Bulls and he starts winning championships in the league in his late 20s and after. His Bulls teams are widely considered to be the best teams ever. After he retired in 2003 the focus shifted to Kobe and Shaq who were winning rings with the Lakers until Shaq left for the Heat. While this was happening, LeBron was playing really well on really bad Cleveland teams.   LeBron makes the finals in 2008 basically by himself and loses to Tim Duncan's Spurs which are considered one of the most well-balanced and well-coaches teams ever. Popovich is the Spurs coach still and is widely regarded as the GOAT coach.   LeBron left for the Heat a few years later and won a few rings in Miami. He also lost a Finals round to Dirk Nowitzkis Mavericks and he caught a LOT of heat for it because he wasn't terribly impressive by LeBron standards.  After that he went back to Cleveland and Steph and Klay Thompson break the NBA with their shooting and win 73/82 games in a season, which is better than any other team has done in the regular season. Despite that, they managed to lose to Lebron's Cavs in the finals. Because the Warriors only went 73/82 and clearly needed some help, they signed Kevin Durant and tore ass through the league until recently when KD left for the Nets and LBJ went to LA.  Since then you're basically caught up. I skipped a shitton of stuff so you'll need to do some more reading on some other fun and important teams like the Nash Suns, Melo Knicks, Rose Bulls, Pierce/KG Celtics, and so on."
I don't know if you've been paying attention but Kevin Durant has committed to the Olympic team.
Does Kevin Durant still exist in this world or nah
"2018 Chris Paul was the best player in a series that featured Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and James Harden"
"Well, how about in the playoff series the lack of adjustments, or failure to take advantage of your strengths over the opponent's weaknesses.  For one, Brook Lopez is a great post scorer, he has been his entire career. The Nets, throughout the series, were guarding him with either Kevin Durant, Jeff Green or Blake Griffin (Occasionally with Claxton), these players should all be food for Brook Lopez inside. To that point, if you go back and look through the games, Brook scored a lot of points whenever he caught the ball in the paint (Except very late in game  7). Why did Bud not set up some plays to take advantage of this size mismatch in the post to draw fouls &amp; score points, especially when the 3 point shooting was failing in games 1 &amp; 2?(Lopez had a great game in the paint, but none of it was from designed play)"
"Incredible offensive players to me are Jordan, Lebron, Shaq, Curry, Kobe, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem and guys like that. Kevin Durant and James Harden. Duncan is not on that level of offense."
Kevin Durant scored the most points in the game 7 injured. Harden was injured and contributed more to the game than Simmons. A 32 yo washed Blake had a much better game than Simmons did. The Nets at least went out with a fight unlike Simmons. This guy is a mental midget.
bro we just went against Kevin fucking Durant Trae scares me way less and I don't think that's an insult to Trae
"I think that there are tiers of players. Obviously I have a personal list but I think it’s easier to argue for tiers that most people can at least generally agree with.   So for tiers in no particular order:  -	**1-5**: Kareem, LeBron, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Shaq OR Hakeem (depends on if you value dominance or skill set) -	**6-10**: Shaq or Hakeem, Wilt, Magic, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan -	**10-15**: Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett, Oscar Robertson, Kobe, Julius Irving  And just because I said that I wouldn’t put Iverson top 30 even though he’s one of my favorite players, I’ll even go up to 30.  -	**15-25**: David Robinson, Jerry West, Dirk, Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Steph Curry, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Dwayne Wade, Scottie Pippen -	**25-30**: John Stockton, Rick Berry, Moses Malone, Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller  I’m sure people are still going to lose their minds over this list but this is what I’ve got based on my personal opinions of being a long time basketball fan as well as talking to other people that played/coached/really love the history."
"Exactly lol. Once again, people forgetting that this is a team sport, and not one person can carry a team to a championship (Kevin Durant is a great example of an amazing player that tried to do this, even though I do dislike him)."
So Kevin Durant?
A post about Kevin Durant being in the camera shot while a baseball pitcher pukes is above the post-game thread of an elimination conference final game. lol
"Bud has been making good adjustments literally all year long. The Bucks, on defense in particular, have been tinkering with the way the play all year.  Funny, one of the best scorers of all time, Kevin fucking Durant, has an insane game against them, and people here calling Bud a terrible coach get hundreds of upvotes."
Kevin Durant/Kevin Durant's the best 2nd option in NBA history
"@HardDebtInfantry: ""Agreed. Also, Kevin Durant was underrated on that Warriors squad."""
"I feel bad for the pitcher who got sick. But I also feel bad for Kevin Durant. He can't even go out to a ballgame and sit near home plate without the camera focusing on him. He should've worn a clever disguise, like a fake mustache or something."
"From ESPN Stats and Info:  Paul George has 20 points in all 18 games this postseason.  He's the 4th player to open a postseason with a streak that long:  Michael Jordan (1992, 1997-98)  Kevin Durant (2012, 2018)  Kobe Bryant (2008)  Paul George (2021)"
"&gt;i give cp3 a slight edge but it’s far closer than some people make it seem. acting as if russ has literally zero argument to be better than cp3 is ridiculous.   He doesn't have an argument.   &gt;Russ has more MVPs  And it's widely looked on as the one of the 2 weakest MVPs in recent memory.   &gt;more WCF appearances, more Finals appearances (but that will change today), more playoff series wins  That's what happens when you play with Kevin fucking Durant for half of your career.   &gt;However, he never made it out of the second round as the best player on his team  Neither has Russ.   &gt;a higher individual peak,  Only if you like round numbers and think that Russ having triple doubles makes him better than CP3"

Kevin Durant: it’s all coming to plan
"I mean we all thought Wiseman was gonna be way better and if that were the case and Giannis demanded a trade, it’s not that implausible. Remember, we basically got DLo for Kevin Durant."
"Their good luck was astonishing (able to take Kevin Durant into cap space because of a massive single-season cap increase), and even their bad luck (Klay injury, Durant leaving) was turned into opportunity. The main piece was that they were able to nab three foundational players in four years, so they were able to align their salaries and contracts to keep the team together over the long haul. So good luck, and good management, but the good management wouldn't have looked as good without the luck."

"My 2 year old: I love mashed tapatoes.   Kevin Durant, furiously typing: they're called potatoes u dumbass bitch second of all everyone loves mashed potatoes u ain't special"
"Idk, shooting 3s better than Iguodala isn’t really a high bar. Siakam shot the 3 better this year than Cousins in GSW and with the same core of Steph/Klay/Dray?   Forget about 40% from 3, even adding a shooter who shoots 35~37% from 3 would be better spacing.   If you don’t believe me, go back and watch the 2019 Finals. We had *one* non-center outside of Steph and Klay who shot league average TS% in that Finals. That guy? Kevin Durant. And he only played 12 minutes that series."
"I iant saying Okoro is the next Kawhi, but as a 19 year old kid he guarded literally every single All-Star night in and night out and held most of them to well below average scoring and play.    https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2021/04/isaac-okoro-undaunted-after-defending-gauntlet-of-nba-stars-including-stephen-curry.html   “But Isaac makes you beat him. He doesn’t give you angles, he doesn’t go for steals and get out of position. He makes you have to score over the top of him, and I thought he did a great job of that in the first half for sure.”  Harden’s attempts to get past or around the stout Okoro were to no avail, so much that he didn’t even take a shot until a minute and 25 seconds into the second quarter.   “It was impressive from the young fella,” said Taurean Prince, who scored a season-high 17 points in his Cavs debut. “Usually you see guys kinda get happy feet guarding those caliber of players, but he was staying solid and sticking to his principles. Definitely stuck to the game plan. He definitely looked well-prepared and focused out there, and that’s truly all you can ask (for) out of the young guy.”  Of course, Harden is not going to be held down for very long. He found some success in the second-half and overtime periods, and ended up dropping 21 points (along with recording his third consecutive triple-double for the Nets). With that said, when you look at the shots he made, he didn't actually score on Okoro until the 3:28 mark in the fourth quarter.  https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/nba-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-isaac-okoro-swarms-james-harden-brooklyn-nets-kyrie-irving-kevin-durant-defense  Pre All-Star break, a span of time consisting of 31 games, Okoro averaged a mere 8.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Not exactly encouraging numbers for a top five pick averaging 33.2 minutes a game up to that point.  Post All-Star break, the rook has scored at a rate of 10.6 points per game, adding 3.4 rebounds and is still dishing out just 1.9 assists. What’s more? Okoro is having a great month of May as through seven games, he is posting about 16.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists.  “Ice,” as he is often referred to, showcased exactly what he is capable of in a May 4 matchup against the Phoenix Suns (currently the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference) in which he exploded for a career-high 32 points while defending two of the game’s best in Chris Paul and Devin Booker.  He did a bit of everything offensively as he hit 10-of-16 of his field goal attempts and shot three-of-four from three-point range while also going nine-of-nine from the free throw line.  https://kingjamesgospel.com/2021/05/14/cleveland-cavaliers-should-isaac-okoro-make-one-all-rookie-teams/"
"I also saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in Brooklyn yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.     He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”     I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.     The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.     When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical interference,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"I think the best example of Steph's leadership qualities, is when he casually took a backseat upon the arrival of Kevin Durant, allowing Durant to acclimate himself and his skills, into the Warriors style of play"
"It's [here](https://www.brewhoop.com/2014/3/6/5478088/giannis-fan-driver-arena)!  As a bonus there's an [early interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZu9Y_4SCks) with him pre-draft. One little storyline it's been frustrating to see sports media miss over the Nets/Bucks series was how much Giannis admired/s Kevin Durant. Obviously he mentions it in the interview I linked above but there's [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGIrZJ0VnHY&amp;t=60s) from his rookie season where around the (I think) 2:15 mark he talks about how excited he was when he had to guard Kevin Durant, and talking so happy about how he managed to block one of his shots."
"I love KD as a player. He could stand to toughen up off the court. As he once said, he’s Kevin Durant. Why does he let stuff like this bother him? He should endeavor to be above it more often."
"that’s why the KD Warriors are the best team in basketball period. Not only do you have arguably the greatest scorer of all time in Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, but you added him to the best regular season team of all time led by Stephen Curry whose offensive +/- the past 7 healthy seasons has been number 1 in the league.   Steph also has an argument for greatest scorer of all time and has the most influential gravity the game has ever seen, on par with shaq. We witnessed that this past season, and he led the league in points and ppg on league best efficiency on whatever minimum shot attempts (Kevin “you know who I am” Durant actually led it but he had too few games to be in contention).  Then you had Klay “Game 6“ Thompson, who can get BUCKETS with the best of em. No one is hotter than Klay Thompson when they get hot, he has the NBA records to prove that. 6’7’ SG who was at one time the best two way player in the entire league. The ultimate SG you’d want on a 5 man rotation. There are levels to catch and shoot. And he guarded the opposing team’s best perimeter player most nights.  This is rounded out by Draymond Green, the modern era’s best defender period.  We took for granted that it wasn’t just all stars joining forces, it was literally two Top 15 players of ALL TIME, and 2 (3 if you think Iguodala gets in) other Hall of Famers. Yeah, watching what Steph and KD did individually this past season was spectacular to watch as a fan. Here’s hoping that Klay, too, makes us remember how fucking badass he is. The game will feel robbed if he doesn’t"
"Honestly, my posts all weekend were lazy because I shut my laptop off after I end my work week and I *really* don't like having to turn it back on, and looking this stuff up takes more than twice as long on my tablet or phone.  So anyway....... I showed you a league history indicating teams in their 30s don't win rings very often, and 40 years of most-valuable-player-on-title-teams being in their 20s. You showed me outliers. Every player we're looking at is exceptional, so if these guys don't indicate players tend to be in their primes in their 30s, some outlier performances aren't going to sway me.  Additionally - you keep pointing out that guys that are 29 tend to be more successful than guys who are 26... That in no way invalidates my point. If anything IT SUPPORTS it. It makes complete sense that guys will more often be at the peak of their powers at the tail end of their prime, combining the fact that they are still in their peak athletic form with their increased basketball IQ/skill level. That doesn't mean they're still peaking in their 30s, because the numbers I've shown you indicate that guys in their 30s clearly don't lead championship teams nearly as often as guys in their 20s, on around a 2:1 level.  You've brought up Finals MVP a bunch, so lets look at that. I'll also look back on the previous list I posted to see who is a top complementary player, and what age their top complementary players were if these are the primary stars. I'll use PLAYOFF Win Shares to determine this. So this whole list is composed of 1. the Finals MVP and 2. the top performer on the team other than the Finals MVP in terms of playoff win shares.  Pre-prime (under 26): 16  Prime (26-29): 38  Post-prime (30 over): 26  Players in their 20s in general are represented at over 2:1 - 54 to 26. On top of the previous data showing the most valuable player in a full season (my point regarding prime) is 26-29 at a 2:1 rate, and the fact that weighted by minutes only 9 championship teams all time have been over 30.  In addition - you've got multiple long stretches where guys in their 20s dominate the list, while there's really only one period where guys in their 30s dominate it: 1994-1998 where 9/10 players are in their 30s. Outside of that stretch players in their 20s crush the players in their 30s by a score of 53-17.  2020 - Lebron James, age 35 (compl. to Anthony Davis, age 26)  2019 - Kawhi Leonard, 27 (compl. is Kyle Lowry, 32)  2018 - Kevin Durant, 29 (compl. is Draymond Green, 27)  2017 - Kevin Durant, 28 (compl. to Steph Curry, 28)  2016 - Lebron James, 31 (compl. is Kyrie Irvin, 23)  2015 - Andre Iguodala, 31 (compl. to Steph Curry, 26)  2014 - Kawhi Leonard, 22 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 37)  2013 - Lebron James, 28 (compl. is Chris Bosh, 28)  2012 - Lebron James, 27 (compl. is Dwyane Wade, 30)  2011 - Dirk Nowitzki, 32 (compl. is Tyson Chandler, 28)  2010 - Kobe Bryant, 31 (compl. to Pau Gasol, 29)  2009 - Kobe Bryant, 30 (compl. is Pau Gasol, 28)  2008 - Paul Pierce, 30 (compl. to Kevin Garnett, 31)  2007 - Tony Parker, 24 (compl. to Tim Duncan, 30)  2006 - Dwyane Wade, 24 (compl. is James Posey, 29)  2005 - Tim Duncan, 28 (compl. to Manu Ginobili, 27)  2004 - Chauncey Billups, 27 (compl. is Ben Wallace, 29)  2003 - Tim Duncan, 26 (compl. is David Robinson, 37)  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal, 29 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 23)  2001 - Shaquille O'Neal, 28 (compl. to Kobe Bryant, 22)  2000 - Shaquille O'Neal, 27 (compl. is Kobe Bryant, 21)  1999 - Tim Duncan, 22 (compl. is David Robinson, 33)  1998 - Michael Jordan, 34 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 32)  1997 - Michael Jordan, 33 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 31)  1996 - Michael Jordan, 32 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 30)  1995 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 32 (compl. to Clyde Drexler, 32)  1994 - Hakeem Olajuwon, 31 (compl. is Robert Horry, 23)  1993 - Michael Jordan, 29 (compl. is Horace Grant, 27)  1992 - Michael Jordan, 28 (compl. is Horace Grant, 26)  1991 - Michael Jordan, 27 (compl. is Scottie Pippen, 25)  1990 - Isiah Thomas, 28 (compl. is Bill Laimbeer, 32)  1989 - Joe Dumars, 25 (compl. is Isiah Thomas, 27)  1988 - James Worthy, 26 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 28)  1987 - Magic Johnson, 27 (compl. is James Worthy, 25)  1986 - Larry Bird, 29 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 28)  1985 - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 37 (compl. to Magic Johnson, 25)  1984 - Larry Bird, 27 (compl. is Kevin McHale, 26)  1983 - Moses Malone, 27 (compl. is Maurice Cheeks, 26)  1982 - Magic Johnson, 22 (compl. is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 34)  1981 - Cedric Maxwell, 25 (compl. to Larry Bird, 24)"

"I don't think you're understanding me.  &gt;1) you're acting like every team has a Kevin Durant  There's a big gap between having KD for a max and having this guy for a max. You're acting like there aren't a lot of good players in that gap.   &gt;2) You're completely ignoring the amount of games lost within single digits and the amount of 4th quarters lost by shifts in momentum.   I'm saying the games that are lost in single digits would be lost by a lot more if instead of a decent player for that $30 million who've played 24 minutes in the game you have this dude.  &gt;""If the game is close in the 4th quarter you should win them all anyways with your max guy""  &gt;So every team should handily win all close games because they can all acquire max players?  The point of quotations is to quote someone lol. You don't get to just twist what I said and put quotation on it like I said it.  When I say real player I don't mean a Harden or KD or Curry. Any decent player, even if overpaid would be a huge upgrade over this guy for a max.  &gt;I think they can assemble a roster with the deadliest single 4th quarter weapon in all of sports.  They can...for like $5-10 million, because that ""deadliest"" dude is literally a paperweight for the first like 40 minutes of the game lol. Giving him a max is basically playing with a handicap for 80% of the game."
"1) you're acting like every team has a Kevin Durant  2) You're completely ignoring the amount of games lost within single digits and the amount of 4th quarters lost by shifts in momentum.   ""If the game is close in the 4th quarter you should win them all anyways with your max guy""   So every team should handily win all close games because they can all acquire max players?  If teams can find ways to hold KD, Kyrie, and Harden I think they can assemble a roster with the deadliest single 4th quarter weapon in all of sports."
But does Kevin Durant have a 100% FG in the fourth quarter of a playoff game? I don’t think so ergo Ben Simmons&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;KD
"Is Kevin Durant actually as good as everyone thinks?  yes   Come back next week for my follow up article   ""How good is Kevin Durant ACTUALLY?"""
"With the exception of actual non-shooters like Ben Simmons or many centers, 90% of NBA players aren’t so bad at shooting that they don’t need to be guarded at all. Steven Adams and Enes Kanter were the only guys on the OKC roster who you could just completely ignore every single possession if they stood behind the perimeter (which they’d didn’t do). The Cavs and Warriors both had players like that too. Every single other person on their team had the ability to hit 3s, as proven by the fact that they…hit 3s. There is your answer. Was their shooting and spacing as good as the Cavs? No. Was that the main reason they lost and the Cavs won? No.  LeBron James, the star player of the Cleveland Cavaliers, played extremely well in 3 elimination games against the Warriors. Kevin Durant can’t say the same. Parsing the difference in their play in these respective series entirely on the basis of the relative quality of their spacing is a false premise. From the beginning to the end, that has been my argument.   If you really believe in your heart of hearts that spacing is what made that gap, more power to you. It’s just wrong though."
You’ve actually convinced yourself that Kevin Durant played with 4 cardboard cutouts that could just be ignored entirely.
"His value to the team was ironically because he wasn't a stylistic fit. He gave them an out for when the motion offense got shut down by physical bruisers hounding Curry and teams going small to switch everything.   If you asked me in 2016 what change I would make so that the Warriors could overcome that kind of defense, I'd say get them a tall iso player who can get buckets when the sets aren't creating anything good. Kevin Durant was basically the answer to that, and I point to the 2018 Clippers first round series as proof, as well as Cleveland Game 4 in 2017 (the ref fuckery game)"
"Not controversial enough.    ""*IS* Kevin Durant very good as basketball?"" 😁"
"i thought they were talking about trae young, freak of nature 7 footer just like shaq and kevin durant ..."
"LeBron doesn't get criticized for the standards of being a best player, he gets criticized by the standards of a Mount Rushmore player, Kawhi isn't even close to that.  Criticizing Kawhi the same way LeBron gets criticized is asinine, he isn't the same caliber of player all-time and doesn't have the same aspirations (being the GOAT). Nobody in the league is held to the same standard as LeBron, neither they should be, they aren't in the same level as he is all-time, the only one that is even remotely close is Kevin Durant."

"Look, I think you're getting a *little* ahead of yours...

"After Kevin Durant, I'm numb to it"
"I would say the Bucks mostly because they had to go to a Game 7 with Brooklyn. I know that in basketball, scoring phenoms like AD and James Harden can make or break a squad, but if your superstar is out and everyone else can’t pick up the slack, then you’re a bad team (I’m an armchair Steven A., I know lol). We’re seeing that with Atlanta right now and that’s definitely what happened with both LA teams. I think Phoenix could had made it this far regardless of injury. If Kyrie and James Harden were 100% for the entire series with Milwaukee, it would had went a different way. It really came down to a shot from Kevin Durant, but if the Bucks could had won that game without partially luck, then it would not had come down to that shot. Phoenix plays better basketball as a team than the other teams they faced in the playoffs this year."
He wakes up and decides if it’s a Kevin Durant type day or a Kuzma type day

"Khris ""Kevin Durant"" Middleton."
"Kris ""Kevin Durant in the 4th"" Middleton"
I’d trade everyone on the team except Giannis for Kevin Durant
"100%  We already saw what the GSW big 3 could do (literally won 73 games)...they already had their style down pat.  Adding one of the greatest players ever (offensively) isn't gonna hurt much in the grand scheme (we saw...they won twice).  But the better ""team"" play was before they had Durant.  I think I agree with you that KD is the player you build a team around instead of just adding him in...at least in terms of team fit/chemistry.  Kevin hasn't won that way yet though...and probably never will.  KD makes every team better at the base...but his style of play (and lack of *elite* defense) makes it harder to build the perfect team around him.  As much as I dislike LeBron for the whole superteam thing, he has won because he is elite on offense and defense, which means you have a broader spectrum with which to build around him."
"I'll add an interesting one:   During the 2018 NBA Finals, Kevin Durant sat out 37 minutes  The Cavs outscored them by 26 points in these minutes, despite Curry often playing them  I've often seen the opinion that this final would still be an easy Warrior win without KD, but is this actually true?  Especially since 2 out of the 4 games were actually close and in game 3 all the other Warrior players kind of failed"
"It took me watching that replay about 5 times before believing it wasn't a 3, Kevin Durant is filthy, I just think the nets were better off pre harden trade so I shit on them any chance I get"
"If this is all it takes to become an NBA reporter, I'll toss my hat in the ring.    [H20onthego] Report: Kevin Durant is very good at basketball"
Bucks won because of injuries to the Nets and Kevin Durant having big feet. They didn't make adjustments and would have been bounced in 5 or 6 with a healthy Kyrie and or Harden.
lmao the 'hospital Nets' still had Kevin Durant and James Harden (albeit a somewhat injured one).  that's two top five players in the league.
"I hope your just trolling but I’ll answer your question anyways. KD has been the best player on every team he has played for and the model leader. KD won mvp on that okc team, not Russ. Who won 2 finals mvps in gsw? KD. Curry doesn’t even have one (even though he should). And for the Nets, they wouldn’t have even made into the ecf if it wasn’t for Kevin Durant. KD elevates his teammates, he makes all of his teams go from good playoff teams to championship contenders/ locks. He is probably the 2nd best sf of all time behind LeBron. He is probably the best scorer of all time. He will be a top 20/15 player of all time when he retires."
"“Hell, no. How can you blame [the Warriors]? Hell, no. I heard the Warriors pressured me into getting back. Nobody never said a word to me during rehab as I was coming back. It was only me and [director of sports medicine and performance] Rick [Celebrini] working out every day. Right when the series started, I targeted Game 5. Hell, nah. It just happened. It’s basketball. S— happens. Nobody was responsible for it. It was just the game. We just need to move on from that s— because I’m going to be back playing.” - Kevin Durant"
That had a little more to do with having Kevin Durant on the team and having Kyrie/Love injured in the other one
"The team that wins this year - will not win next. Steph Curry, Lebron James, and Kevin Durant are still in the league."
"It’s a basic spin move and attempt dunk. He wanted to dunk but he couldn’t so he had to finger roll. Lots of players do this. Paul George, kevin Durant, Joel Imbid , etc etc.  And giannis handle is no where near kyrie Irving’s. I can handle the ball better than giannis."
"No, for me, that's absolutely the case. Paul hasn't played on very many teams that had a realistic chance to get this far, and further. Kobe and LeBron and Steph and Durant did. Does anyone doubt Durant would have led Brooklyn to a great shot at the championship if he even had one of the other two stars at full health?  But, the reality is that when you have few opportunities to really prove your legacy as an all time great, there's that much more pressure to produce. When Dirk had the chance, he came through. This is Paul's moment. He's still a great, great player, and he's playing with a lot of talent. There's no fucking way a Kawhi-less LAC team should even be competitive - and it's not, as long as Paul and/or Booker hit their normal shots.  It's not fair to a player of Paul's accomplishments that his legacy still hangs in the balance. But it's because when you get to very very top, the only thing we can really use to differentiate one player from another is his performance at the very highest levels - even if it's an unfairly small sample size.  To me or any halfway reasonable fan, Paul is an all time great. Sure. Nobody's questioning whether he's better than Russell Westbrook or Kevin Johnson. At the most upper echelons, the differences between the #7 player of all time and #23 player of all time are razor thin. It comes down to moments like the one that's in front of Paul the next few weeks. I personally hope he kills it."
2019 NBA champions: Toronto Raptors* Asterisk reason: Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5 and Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. Kawhi Leonard rested all season and a timely gust of wind at the end of Game 7 against Philadelphia 76ers nudged the ball just enough to fall in the basket. Unfair.
"not gonna lie, i cant even find any out of bounds call on youtube. only thing close is either saving from out of bounds or the kevin durant out of bounds no call.

I could see Kuzma being in a package for a player like Kevin Durant      Provided LeBron is in said package
"This is tough, who's better? Reggie Jackson or Kevin Durant right now?"
the bucks got him to harass people like kevin durant not hit free throws
"I mean I know no one wants to say it because he's a 7 footer with handles who can hit fade away threes in his sleep...but Kevin Durant is an goddamn child. I literally can't think of a single human on earth more sensitive than this fucking guy. Just constant toddler level shit. No wonder you never hear about the guy off the court, pretty sure he spends every waking hour searching his own name on Twitter. Anyone who knows Jackie Mac knows she's legit as they come and has been longer than KD has been alive. If she says he said something to that effect, he did. Period. Not to mention, imagine how out of pocket you gotta be, getting pissed off about a reporter saying you said want to win multiple championships with the team you're under contract with. Put your fucking phone down, Kevin. You'll feel better after a few days, I promise."
Kevin Durant is in the good tier for sure
I think briefly Kevin Durant reached that status when he first signed with the Warriors. But they didn't dominate the way everyone thought and the hate trailed off into a general dislike.
Kevin Durant joined the Warriors and tweets mean things. He gets treated worse than a lot of the other scumbags that have populated the league in the last 30 years.
Kevin Durant clearly
I know Durant won but I really fucking hate Olynyk. Yea Cleveland hates Durant but at least he was a great player and beat us on the court. Kelly olynyk cost us a title by putting Kevin love in a shoulder crank
Kevin Durant. He's so skilled at his craft and makes it look so easy
Kevin Durant
"She lied. Period.  That is WAY too specific of a goal to throw out and fall back on ""it's ma opinion"".  I can make the same fucking inference that Kevin Durant would like to win championships with the Brooklyn Nets. No.Shit.  I can't however tell you that he'd like to specifically win THREE championships and make certain Brooklyn is HIS legacy. That's a crazy intimate goal to ""speculate"" on and I 100% understand why KD would be pissed to have that indirectly implied as coming from his conversations with Jackie.  It's misleading at best."
"Everyone is going after Mcmullan for somehow lying about her conversation with KD but all she said was Kevin Durant’s “genuine goal is to win 3 championships’ with Nets”.  Kevin Durant before last year signed a 4 year deal with the Nets. In his first season, he has not won an NBA championship. Therefore, Kevin Durant has 3 years left with the Nets. If Kevin Durant is as competitive on basketball court as he is on twitter, he wants to win the championship every year. If he wins the chip every year he has left as a Net he would win 3 times. Is it all that crazy what she said? What am i missing?"
"I think it does to be honest. No offense at all here not trying to single you out but do you honestly believe the suns beating the lakers without AD, the nuggets without Murray and injured MPJ and the clippers without ibaka, kawhi and injured Morris. Then they’ll go play the bucks who almost just lost to Kevin Durant and half of James harden.  I’m really not trying to offend but that is a complete joke. It’s the luckiest/easiest path to a title ever.   Does this suns run compare to kawhi beating embiid, butler, simmons, then giannis and Middleton, then Steph, klay for most the series? Not even close, in any way shape or form. Bron winning in 2016 is a real chip, this year is a joke because if all the injuries"
She never said that he told her that. It was her opinion of what she thinks Kevin Durant wants to accomplish during his tenure with the Nets
"Nah man, This amount of injury has tainted the season. The suns haven’t played a full team lol, clippers are injured as hell, hawks just aren’t a finals worthy team yet and the bucks almost just lost to Kevin Durant and half of harden. Yeah injuries happen but the amount of injuries are insane and have absolutely changed the outlook of this season and that’s not even arguable."
"i'll give him that joe harris does set good screens, but this is not like kevin durant or harden or someone who you can say ""well even if KD missed the shot it was our best chance we went with our best guy"".   it's joe harris and he really seemed to have lost all shooting touch and confidence by at least game 3 in the series  it was just frustrating to watch because shamet had been playing better than harris for most of the series and barely saw the floor when it mattered most"
"I went back and listened to it. They were talking about KD's legacy, but it's not like ""What was Kevin Durant thinking when he left Golden State?"" was the topic or anything. She just kinda said this unprompted after the 3 rings in Brooklyn thing when Simmons was talking about who should've won each championship:  &gt; Honest to God, the amount of time I've talked with him, I just think Kevin Durant is searching for something he's never gonna find. I really believe that. I think he's searching for this inner peace...this happiness, this joy, that just isn't ever gonna exist for him. I wish that weren't true, but that's just my personal opinion.  That sounds like it's about more than basketball to me, idk. And all I'm saying is it'd be really fucking weird to hear someone talking like that about you on a podcast if you don't really know them. I know armchair psychology for athletes is a fairly normal and innocuous thing but that specific comment seemed like it crossed a line."
starting to think you guys are supposed to be the heels of this post season.   1. All non OT wins have been boring blow outs   2. Somehow Kevin Durant came out their series a sympathetic babyface.   3. Basically have a built in “million dollar man” Ted Dibiase-esque  gimmick given their name.  4. Everyone seems to hate coach bud.   5. Post wrestlemania 13 Bret hart vibes.
The Hawks have a fun brand of basketball to watch. These playoffs have actually been a lot of fun just to watch the Bucks play some impressive teams. The Heat series was rough but watching a Nets superstar team really gut out the series was awesome. Just watching Kevin Durant play at the level he did was a treat. Even Harden getting out their on one leg and being the second option for the Nets was cool. Blake Griffin even relished being a defensive answer for Giannis was a cool thing to see from a former superstar. These East playoffs are just great for everyone in my opinion.
"You're not wrong, but in this context I think there's a huge difference between an anonymous poster and *Jackie MacMullan*, or the guy with the Nets book that was on the Lowe Post a couple weeks ago and said essentially the same thing. Like KD said, she framed her whole monologue as if she'd sat down and discussed these things with him, and a reasonable listener could assume she had since she's Jackie MacMullan.   It just struck me when I listened to it cause she was basically portraying Durant as chronically depressed, and I was like ""KD's *gonna* call her out if she's just making this shit up"". Obviously he responded to the 3 rings headline so maybe he doesn't care about the mental health comments, but his response does suggest that Jackie was just wildly speculating about his mental health with zero sourcing, which seems...not chill. Kinda doubt those comments fly about Kevin Love."
Injuries happen and Giannis may decide he's Kevin Durant in game 3 and jack up too many three's. I agree that if Giannis attacks the rim they win the series (probably in 6) but with the Bucks/Giannis you just don't know. Maybe he's growing as a player and he is locked in this year but we still gotta see it.
I honestly can't believe Kevin Durant is getting the benefit of the doubt here over Jackie fucking Mac.
"I didn't grill him, KD did.   https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2837535-kevin-durant-chris-broussard-argue-on-twitter-over-love-hate-relationship.amp.html  The words you choose to use do matter when you're trying to communicate. Also 69% of all statistics are made up... see what I just did there?"
Lmao but you like Kevin Durant? That’s hilarious
16 year olds act more mature than Kevin Durant
How can she come to an opinion that Kevin durant vehemently denied? Is she weak in communication  or is she making shit up to promote herself?
"Kevin Durant. According to Scottie, he still has a lot to learn."
"I don’t like to do this, but I listened to the podcast bill simmons had recently with Jackie on it. She was talking about KD for a while. In my head I was like “wow, she has never spoken to KD has she” after she was saying “Kevin Durant is on a mission to make himself happy and I don’t think he will ever reach that. He will end up never answering the questions that he is seeking out.”  Like shut the fuck up, he plays basketball for a living. He isn’t on a soul searching quest to defeat evil and drop a ring in mount doom."
Kevin “Dana white” Durant - Jackie was never my friend
