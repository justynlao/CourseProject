"Alperen Sengun is a probable lotto pick no one has heard of, but he could a beast in this league. Usman Garuba could go in the lotto too, and he’s been amazing in Spain.    Daishen Nix, Jared Butler, Scottie Barnes and Chris Duarte will be the steals of this draft. But it’s filled with talent from top to bottom."
"The problem is the center position in the NBA is really crowded.  Only so many teams actually looking for centers.  And a lot of the teams that could use centers are looking for vets.  I find it tough to think of a team off the top of my head that could actually use Wiseman more than the Warriors.  I suppose there are teams like the Spurs or Wizards that could be patient with him.  But even then, next year's draft is pretty strong at the center position.  Evan Mobley and Alperen Sengun may both be better prospects than Wiseman."

"Alperen Sengun. He is 18 years old and putting up 19.3/9.4/2.4/1.3/1.6 on 70% TS. This in a European grown man league and he is doing it as an 18 year old. Is like number 1 or 2 in the league for points, rebounds, blocks, efficiency and is one of the highest for assists and steals for a bigman. Problem is he is listed as 6'9"" or 6'10"" and he doesn't look the part in terms of athleticism. Some places have him as top 10 in their draft board, some have him as mid second round. He reminds me of Domatas Sabonis but I don't know if that is his floor or his ceiling. At the same age, he was more productive than Jusuf Nurkic, Porzingis, Marc Gasol, and Dario Saric as compared to an [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender) (scroll down to see a graph)."

"I might be dumb, but I think that the player that fits thr most with y'all is Alperen Sengun. I mean, I would hate A LOT, he's the one I want the Spurs to get but let's get this away for a moment. Assuming Lowry leaves, y'all still have solid players, this year it was just a strange one for y'all (and everyone, but you specifically). See this, VanVleet-Trent Jr-OG-Siakam-Sengun. Doesn't this sound good? Well, I'm crazy high on Alperen sooo... Anyway, do y'all have money? You could pursue Richaum Holmes too and strenghten the bench and pick whoever you want, maybe a guard if Trent isn't the chosen one.

Alperen Sengun szn 😎
Imho Alperen Sengun is a safer pick then Mobley. Euroleague is a higher level in comparison to the NCAA. I would use Oklahoma's 2nd pick for a Gaurd or Forward and use the 5th pick on Alperen Sengun instead.

As an example: projected lottery pick Alperen Sengun absolutely demolished him a couple of months ago in Turkish League. He fouled out in 10 minutes.
"&gt;a traditional big with some rim running that scored everything at the basket.  He has a lot of modern game in him in that he is an excellent passer and has ""wow"" passes and racks up a bunch of assists. He actually averaged more assists per min than Jokic did at the same age and the Adriatic league is very comparable to the Turkish League in terms of level of play. In addition, for better or for worse, Sengun is really good at getting to the line which usually translates to the NBA. He hasn't developed a 3 point shot yet but he would have to shoot the 3 from 46% to make it the same efficiency that he is already scoring at with super high volume. With his 80% ft percentage there is reason to think he can develop it. In terms of defense, he was number 2 at getting blocks in his league and also has the most steals for a PF/C. I know defensive stats don't always translate but fwiw an international scout Kuzey Kilic said he was the second best rim protector in his league already that contains 2 Euroleague teams and is a top 3 domestic league in europe.  Just look at the chart on this [article](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30503246/nba-draft-stock-watch-scouting-international-stars-no-1-pick-contender) that compares Alperen to other euro bigmen at the same age including Porzingis, Jokic, Marc Gasol, and Jusuf Nurkic. Alperen actually improved his assists/blocks/steals considerably since then."

"Star - Russell Westbrook - He's in a spot where he can do what he does best, but, without needing to be the first or second scoring option. Lebron tends not to miss when it comes to picking stars as teammates, and, Westbrook has a spirit that won't quit.  Emerging Star - Kevin Porter Jr. - he's got the keys as full time, starting PG for to the Rockets, and is equipped with young talent in Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, along with more seasoned players in Christian Wood and Daniel Theis. He put up a monstrous performance against the reigning champs (resulting in a rare victory  for the Rockets last season), to go along with some moments of promising play before the season's end  Unproven Star - Scottie Barnes - there were many skeptics who voiced their disapproval of the Raptors choosing Scottie Barnes so high, but, he showed out in the Summer League. I think Scottie Barnes may very well end up making an impactful statement for why the Raptors choose him, especially within an organization that has a strong reputation for developing young players"
"probably picking the most obvious team here, but:  KPJ  Jalen Green  Jae'Sean Tate  Christian Wood  Alperen Sengun  Off the Bench: Eric Gordon, KMJ, Nwaba, Theis, Josh Christopher, Gerald Green  Bold of me to only use one superstar: Gerald Green"
Our center position needs work.  Birch is fine as a placeholder but we need to develop a better starter for the 5 in the long run or trade for a project like Naz Reid or Alperen Sengun.
"I could only see Alperen Sengun without paying for it, so congratulations, Houston. You got a superstar!"
"&gt; And now we get to the strawmans.  You literally listed Noah Vonleh as someone who was dominant in Summerleague... then went on to say Alperen was inefficient.  &gt; Obviously summer league is basketball, but not all basketball is indicative of how play will translate to the professional level...  And all 5 on 5 basketball has some correlation with how they play in the league.    &gt;With vonleh, to the point I was referencing, he was above Sengun in points and efficiency.  Nope, he was terrible. Whether you take his rookie year or even all  years averaged he was worse than Sengun AND he didn't have the blocks, steals, assists, rebounds that Sengun had. You need to make sure your facts are  straight otherwise you seem like a complete idiot when you try to correct other people when you yourself are completely wrong.  &gt;the other 15 or so names I mentioned that you conveniently ignored.  I mentioned a couple of them, for example, Omer Yurtseven was older. Like I said elsewhere, you did the shotgun approach of not having a single good example listeing a bunch of names which even you yourself know is completely bullshit. If you think Noah Vonleh was a dominant Summerleague player, you need to stop wasting peoples time online with this nonsense.  &gt;Again, summer league means nothing.  Yes it means absolutely nothing, has zero correlation with how people play. Centers play like guards and guards play like Centers. Someone who shoots 5 3's a game in Summerleague is just as likely to be a back to the basket center in the NBA. You can't say I strawman when it comes from your mouth again in the same reply once again.   If you think Noah Vonleh was a dominant Summerleague player, I don't have the time or craysons anymore to educate you."
"&gt; That was my point. Are you agreeing with me there ?  Ya I agree with your point, people enter a 5th dimension when they play summerleague and their play has zero correlation with how they play. It isn't even basketball anymore.   &gt;And it culminated in him averaging an inefficient 14/11. Which is fine but far from standout.  Nice job making 11 rebounds sound bad when it is spectacular... And ignoring the blocks, steals, assists, and turnovers.. You say Alperen Sengun wasn't great in Summer league but Noah Vonleh dominated when Alperen had more points, rebounds, blocks, steals, assists, and was way more efficient... You do finally see how what you have stated is really dumb by redditor standards?  You are living in such cognitive dissonance if you consider Noah Vonleh dominant in summerleague but Alperen Sengun not being a standout in summerleague. That is really dumb even among the really dumb people on here on reddit."
"Most of these guys didn't just come from Euorpe and go on Summerleague and dominate it though, and most of them didn't even play in it. You made it seem guys come from Europe are more prepared and dominate summerleague all the time. Sengun is one of the very few. You said it is because he is from Europe and couldn't find European examples of others who did and other person said it is because he is ""bigger and stronger"" so he dominated when he really isn't just some 7'0"" 260 lb freak who just bullies everyone and even so the case the physical guys haven't dominated like Alperen either. He stands out as the best among pretty much any other bigman in terms of summer league production."
"&gt; do you expect him to become a star based on that 4 game sample?  No, I expect to analyze this data we have and include it with the other data we have so far.  &gt;The league is going away from the traditional back to the basket big and unless he develops another elite tool offensively (passing or outside shooting) he's going tot have a cap on his potential.  Alperen already has the elite passing for a big. He is arguably better at passing for his age than Jokic or Sabonis were. As for outside shooting, he would have to shoot 46% from 3 to be as efficient as he was from the inside so can't blame him for not developing that. He shot 80% from the line so there is huge optimism that he will develop it but even if he doesn't he has elite passing like I said.  &gt;Just looking at the stats a player like JV looks like a star based on his stats per minn but he's not able to stay on the cour because of his defense.  JV played in this when he was like 23 years old already though. He was stuck in europe for multiple years and was already a young vertern compared to the other guys he played against. JV also didn't have the elite defensive stats that Sengun has. I am kinda surprised people are ignoring 3 blocks and all those steals per game, small sample size or not. He did the same thing in Europe."
"Doesnt project to be that by who?  [NBAdraftroom](https://nbadraftroom.com/alperen-sengun/) projects him as Sabonis / Vucevic  ESPN’s Mike Schmitz compared his passing to Jokic  Sports Illustrated’s Jeremy Woo said “His upside lies in his potential as a passer and jump shooter”  ESPN’s Jonathan Givony projected him as “the focal point of his club…Dominant interior scorer with preternatural instincts crashing the glass, creating for teammates”  John Hollinger said he’s going to be the focal point of a team’s offence with his advanced feel for the game  Sam Vecenie said his passing feel is elite  Just watch this guy man his passing is nuts and very Sabonis like, and he’s only 18"
Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun come to mind
"&gt;\9. Jalen Green averages an efficient 20ppg in his rookie year and wins ROTY by a landslide, Alperen Sengun is also an All-Rookie team member.  Inject this straight into my veins"
Trying to think outside the box here:  Alperen Sengun with John Wall speed and athleticism  Ja Morant with Steven Adams strength  Deandre Ayton with CP3 handle/playmaking
Alperen Sengun is his own thing entirely. He arguably outproduced any other European big ever at the same point in their career in Europe. He continued this trend the  tiny sample size of Summerleague as well but he didn't just outproduce all the European bigs but also arguably any big ever there. Not just in terms of passing/rebounds/scoring but also blocks/steals.   Alperen doesn't have the size that Jokic has but he was better at the same age of their careers on both sides of the ball.
Alperen Sengun
Reading this and feeling slightly less crazy that I think it could be Davion Mitchell or Alperen Sengun
Why is Alperen Sengun not Alligator Sensei
A dark horse pick of someone who hasn't even played a minute in the NBA yet is Alperen Sengun. Look at my post history of the last post I made that shows he pretty much put volume stats in terms of points/rebounds/assists/blocks/steals that no bigmen has ever done in Summerleague (and he was the same way in Europe). Of course this is a giant feat for anyone and less than even a 0.1% chance that it happens.I expect a good amount of 10+/10+/5/5 games from him if what he did in Europe or Summerleague translates at all for him.
Alperen Sengun
Alperen Sengun. Won Turkish MVP and had a flash or 2 during Summer League. Watch out for him in a couple years.
if I had to build an entire team and I had no other pieces I would only just go for players with development. I'd just take a swing on anyone who could become a super star and figure out the rest and just let them play. There's no reason to draft for fit at this stage just figure out what you have  So I would take  G Cade  G Jalen Green  G/F Josh Giddey  F Jonathan Kuminga  C Evan Mobley   Bench   G - Jalen Suggs  G Bones Hyland  G - Josh Primo  F - Scottie Barnes  F Jalen Johnson  F Ziaire Williams   C Alperen Sengun
1. Kyrie Irving will retire with multiple 50-40-90 seasons.  2. The Wizards will be mocked for passing on Alperen Sengun.

"Kai Jones and Alperen Sengun will both fall outside of the top 15.     Jonathan Kuminga will fall at least to the Warriors at #7.     Rockets/Cavs will take Green/Suggs leaving Mobley to the Raptors, who will win a ROY in Toronto."
Now he’s on the Hartenstein hype train. Also advocating for Alperen Sengun to be a top 5 pick
"Ok man, you've outlasted me, Alperen Sengun won't get abused on a nightly basis in the NBA, no way."
"I want Alperen Sengun so damn much but I'm worried the Hornets will take him just before us. If not, I would take Jalen Johnson. If not I would highly consider trading down with like OKC or Knicks."
"Not a pick lower than 18 because the protections fade over time, and seriously, think about this like Jalen Green + Alperen Sengun + Jared Butler for Cade or something like that. What people are missing on this sub is how frequently prospects defy expectations after the draft, for all the talk you don't really know how a prospect will pan out. I hope rockets don't trade if it takes one of those kinds of packages and I think if a trade is made it's going to surprise 99% of people on this sub. It'll happen because the Pistons like somebody other than Cade, and it'll get a much smaller haul than two firsts (And the #2)"

"Kai Jones and Alperen Sengun would be there. The Raps would likely be all over this deal. I think Philly is the least likely to do it, they'd want some picks or something"

"Honestly I wouldn't feel that bad about it, even kinda positive about it tbh. We recently talked about it our sub so I'll leave you down here my thoughts!  I like it, really. What we mainly need is a PF that can play for a couple of years while our prospects at this position (Samanic+Future Picks) develop. Kuzma is good for this! He has a 2+PO Contract; he earns 13M, not that much and in case really tradable; relatively young; played under not that great circumstances; Pop and our development stuff can fix some stuff, Lakers' one is not great and it showed with other young players they traded away. I mean, defintely let's not consider him as a cornerstone of the franchise, he is not, but he can be a great rotational piece for us while better prospects develop! Also, I highly doubt the trade would be just Kuzma, but other stuff will be included. The 22th Pick alone would be awesome, imagine attached to Kuzma too! Also maybe another filler that we can maybe flip for a couple of 2nds, we don't have one in 2022 so...  We are not that trash. With guys like DJ, Derrick, Keldon... we ain't doing what OKC did, we will still try to win games. For example Samanic could start next year, but he is just not ready for that role yet, also we tend to develop prospects slowly in roder to avoid major issues in the future. Also, if we somehow these projects show they deserve more, then just bench Kuz or even trade him, he has a nice contract (13M, 2yrs+PO).  Yeah, I mean, you kinda know my ideas on this team and that I'm really high on basically anyone and I think they all gonna make a major if not a solid jump next year if we finally decide to part away with all our vets. DeMar, as much as I love him, really, I just think that wasn't THAT important on our team if we had Derrick. I mean, we will prolly be a bit worse, but not that much in my opinion. Consider also that defense and size was a big problem last year and without DeMar this will go away, not fully, but still a bit.  Now lemme be the GM for the sake of doing it, you know I like it lmao. So, we will now assume that the [trade](https://imgur.com/qxd8AUj) goes through. LAL get: DeMar DeRozan / SAS get: Kyle Kuzma + Montrezl Harrell + 22th Pick. We then decide to trade Harrell to the Hornets and we get the 57th Pick (via Nets) and the 2022 2nd Round Pick (via Raptors). We do this because we will get a big in the draft and we will play him. We know have the 12th Pick, the 22nd Pick, the 41st Pick, the 57th Pick. (sadly for you lmao) I assume that the player I will choose are available so in order we draft: Alperen Sengun, Ziaire Williams, Isaiah Todd, Ibou Badji. Sengun will immediately play off the bench behind Jakob. I would be surprised tho if Drew played over him at the beginning of the season and they shared minutes. Ziaire Williams had a really inefficient season with Stanford and has ton of things to work on so I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his time in the G-League and I'm a fan of it, it went really good for us! Isaiah Todd most definitely will play with Austin, he has things to work on too. Ibou Badji then is my favourite prospect in this draft (I even made [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/od6bo9/ibou_dianko_badji_15_every_highlights_13p_8r_7b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)/[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/odv548/ibou_dianko_badji_15_green_jersey_highlights_23p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Highlights for the U19 World Cup), he has a crazy high potential for me and taking a gamble with such a low pick is the real deal, all assuming he doesn't withdraw and he is available. He would be a Draft and Stash in Barcelona. If he does withdraw, then idk, maybe ask something else instead to Charlotte or maybe just select someone else.  At the end, as you know I love lmao, here is the final table! I would be kinda excited tbh.  |*Starters*|*Bench Unit*|*Third String*| |:-|:-|:-| |Dejounte Murray|Tre Jones|*Brad Wanamaker*| |Derrick White|Lonnie Walker IV|Wayne Ellington| |Keldon Johnson|Devin Vassell|Ziaire Williams| |Kyle Kuzma|Luka Samanic|Isaiah Todd| |Jakob Poeltl|Alperen Sengun|Drew Eubanks ^(+Ibou Badji (Draft&amp;Stash))|  For minutes I would say the same things I said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/njfdiu/my_complete_guide_of_the_situation_of_the_san/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)."

"For everyone but the stars, being a ""shooter"" refers to 3pt shooting, b/c non-stars aren't going to get to take a bunch of long 2s.    Kanter is a terrible 3-point shooter - what are you talking about?  He's not a young guy - he's been in the league for 10 years, and he's a career 28.6% 3P shooter (21.1% in the playoffs).  He's made 48 in his career (reg season and playoffs combined).  He tried being a 3P threat in the 2016 playoffs, taking 14 of them.  He made 2.  Two.  If he could shoot 3s, he'd have done so, and made a helluva lot more than 44.    Valanciunas averaged more offensive rebounds than Kanter this season, also shot 70% at the rim, and yet he shot 37% from 3.  They aren't mutually exclusive.    As for Ayton, what he's going to be doing in a ""few years"" doesn't make him ""a shooter.""    As for what you think a player might be 3 years from now, what on earth makes you think the Wiz are actually going to develop a player???  What pick outside the top 3 have they developed?  Andray Blatche?    You can fantasize about the Wiz being a competent organization, drafting around some long-term plan, and developing young players, but none of that is reality.    As for AD, he's a career 31% 3P shooter.  He shot 27% this year, and 20% on non-corner 3s.  That's the 4th percentile.    As for Sengun, I haven't even seen official measurements for him, and he looks to me like he's 6'9 in shoes with a barely positive wingspan.  That means he's more likely to play PF rather than C, so he makes even less sense with Rui &amp; Deni.    More importantly, what current or even recent players makes you think Sengun will be able to win deep into the playoffs?  An undersized slow-footed post scorer who can't defend.    This seems like the best overview of Sengun that I've seen - https://id-prospects.com/alperen-sengun-scouting/ - and it reaches a similar conclusion:  ""An undersized post up player and rebounder isn’t exactly a sought after offensive archetype."""
Let's Go Future Spur Alperen Sengun!!!
"Hwo do they compare to the original pre-KD finals rosters?  Steph - Steph  Klay - Klay  Wiggins - Barnes  Dray - Dray  Looney - Bogut  Oubre - Iguodala  Wiseman - David Lee  Poole - Livingston  Damion Lee - Barbosa   And they still have Paschall, the #7 and #14 picks in the draft, which could be two of Scottie Barnes, Davion Mitchell, Jalen Johnson, Alperen Sengun, Moses Moody, or James Bouknight.  Also, sign and trades involving Oubre, Wiseman and/or the #7 pick could land them a Porzingis, Siakam, Markannen or another solid piece."

"I would like either Alperen Sengun or Kai Joned at 12, but I believe that Charlotte will take Sengun at 11. I'd be very happy with Kai at 12"
I hope the Hornets either go for Alperen Sengun or Jalen Johnson.
I can see the Hornets taking Alperen Sengun
Alperen Sengun can actually defend outside of drop schemes unlike Wiseman
Alperen Sengun -- has a similar play style to that of Pau Gasol and Sabonis. Really great touch around the rim and shows the ability to shoot the 3.

The next one is Alperen Sengun. He didn't pass as much though because he shot with over 70% FG and also led his league in points... as an 18 year old.
Likely first-round overseas prospects are:   * Alperen Sengun (Besiktas) * Usman Garuba (Real Madrid) * Josh Giddey (Adelaide)  * Filip Petrusev (Mega Bemax)

Why Alperen Sengun of course
Alperen mothafuckin Sengun  Turkish Delight
“The GOAT” Alperen Sengun  Kenton Martin Jr.  Daniel House Jr.  Garrison Mathews  Armoni Brooks  **End of civilisation**
As an honest and unbiased NBA fan I’ll have to go Alperen Sengun or Usman Garuba

Alperen Sengun
Alperen Sengun. He will grow alongside Jalen Green provided the FO don't fuck it up.
"Alec Burks was only +1 in the game.   Houston had their two best players tonight, KJ Martin JR and Alperen Sengun on the bench to close out the game.   Silas was the best player for the Knicks tonight."
"If Alperen Sengun and Kenyon Martin Jr. get more playing time, yes."
Alperen Sengun was our 16th pick in the draft and is averaging 9/5/2 with 1.4 steals in 19 minutes per game off the bench.  He played 5 minutes tonight.
"Wondered why Alperen Sengun (NBA Player) didn't get much of a run tonight, thanks u/TheFaucetIsStillOn (Reddit User)"

Evan Mobley is the only player on your list I would even put in my top 5 honestly...that's not to take anything away from Cade and both Jalen's but this draft class was absolute loaded! some of these guys are only19-20 years old and in 3 years the list could look very different! but there are two rookies in my mind who are pretty clearly special.. Scottie Barnes and Evan Mobley look like they are going to be the next crop of super stars in the NBA  1. Scottie Barnes (Super Star potential) 2. Evan Mobley  (Super Star Potential)  3. Josh Giddey  4. Chris Duarte 5. Franz Wagner 6. Cade Cunningham (I expect his shooting to improve over time)  7. Jalen Green  8. Davion Mitchell 9. Jalen Suggs  10. Alperen Sengun
1. Ja Morant 2. Zion Williamson 3. Evan Mobley 4. Lamelo Ball 5. Anthony Edwards 6. Scottie Barnes 7. Cade Cunningham 8. RJ Barrett 9. Jalen Green 10. Darius Garland 11. Tyler Herro 12. DeAndre Hunter 13. Jalen Suggs 14. Tyrese Maxey 15. Josh Giddey 16. James Wiseman 17. Patrick Williams 18. Cole Anthony 19. Franz Wagner 20. Jordan Poole 21. Jonathan Kuminga 22. Cam Reddish 23. Alperen Sengun 24. Matisse Thybulle 25. Tyrese Haliburton 26. Rui Hachimura 27. Chris Duarte 28. Deni Avdija 29. Immanuel Quickley 30. Davion Mitchell  Kevin Porter Jr. has to be one of the most overrated assets in the entire league.
Um Alperen Sengun is the best non top-10 rookie
1. Evan Mobley  2. Scottie Barnes  3. Jalen Green  4. Josh Giddey  5. Franz Wagner  6. Chris Duarte  7. Jonathan Kuminga  8. Davion Mitchell  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Alperen Sengun  11. Cam Thomas  12. Jeremiah Robinson Earl  13. Jared Butler  14. Sharife Cooper
Evan Mobley 52%   Scottie Barnes 52%  Franz Wagner 47%   Alperen Sengun 47%  Chris Durate 45%
Alperen Sengun.
Lakers needed an all time performance to beat Alperen Sengun   Hmmm
really how can the lakers hope to hang with the star studded roster of houston featuring mega stars like alperen sengun and jae'sean tate
"What are so early observations?  We need to start Sengun.     Who is a player that has surprised you for the better/for the worse?  Alperen Sengun      How are your offseason acquisition doing?  Theis needs to be benched so Sengun can play.      How are your rookies doing?  Sengun is amazing.      And lastly, (if applicable) how is your new coach doing?  He is not starting Sengun."
Cool to see Alperen Sengun make a business decision on a 15 footer.

"Cam Reddish, Alperen Sengun, Amir Coffey and Caleb Martin are getting to the line more frequently per game. Damn."
Alperen Sengun is not an NBA player
I'm gonna tell my kids that Alperen Sengun is Tony Khan.
Alperen Sengun is about to do it this season
Houston won the rookie draft. Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun 🔥🔥🔥
I will not rest until Alperen Sengun is starting and getting 30+ minutes every night  He’s a much better player than Theis at 19 years old. I do understand why they are giving him limited minutes tho
Alperen Sengun
Alperen Sengun
Yes Jalen Green but I just wanna say Alperen Sengun is gonna be an insane player
Another star player dodging Alperen Sengun  It’s becoming a theme
"yeah, my bad. i guess i'll just sit here with my alperen sengun instead of two future heavily protected firsts that probably won't convey anyway"
"Yep. Also, not sure which other rookies need a post. Maybe Alperen Sengun. But, for the most part, all the decent rookie statlines are put up."
I have no idea why Theis got more than a minimum contract. Alperen Sengun fell in the draft because people thought he wouldn't be able to defend in the league yet he is already a better player than Theis on that end.
"Wild how Lakers had to get Westbrook, Miami had to get Lowry, and Nets had to get Patty all to stop Alperen Sengun"
"Because his  accoplishment troughout his career right now is much more than mobley did. After mobley does what Alperen did when Alperen was   17-18 i will put mobley over Alperen .right now mobley is a promising college kid who happens to be drafted 3rd. Alperen's floor is 10 million$\3years  NBA contract which happens to be thesis btw. And proved himself at olympics ,Eurocup , and in a professional basketball league against Men .And nearly cut the vet from frontcourt day one who was traded for him to teach NBA basketball  . Lol at mobley over sengun 🤪🤪🤪🤪 ."
Sleepin on my boy  Not not Jalen Green                Alperen Sengun
"Alperen Sengun makes All-Rookie 1st team and makes a legit run at ROY.  He's looks extremely polished for a 19 year old and rarely puts a foot wrong (for rookie standards at least). It's only a matter of time before he gets 30-35 minutes a game, and I'm extremely confident he'll put up great numbers in those minutes."
Alperen Sengun... Rookie Of The Year.
Alperen Sengun wins ROTY
"Maybe not the most obvious pick, but Christian Wood.   Rockets will probably struggle a lot early, and with them just drafing Alperen Sengun they may not be commited to Wood longterm"
Alperen Sengun will win rookie of the year.
"The the Magic hands down.  Isaac is a right wing nut who is made of glass.  Cole Anthony is a great dude but doesn't have the size to be an impact player.  Suggs hasn't played a game but I'm not convinced.   Honestly if we are talking young players to be excited about, I still think RJ Hampton has the most upside of anyone on our squad. Which....is sad.  The rockets blew up their team like 8 minutes ago and they have Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, and Alperen Sengun-- all who have all star ceilings.   I'm so jealous."
alperen sengun?
Alperen “Sea Lion” Sengun
"Root for the Rockets. I think right now they have the best future. Im high on KPJ, Jalen Green, Usman Garuba and Alperen Sengun"
"Bulls coz they lookin like they built different.   Mavs (Luka is my 2nd favorite player right now and because I think KP is back).   Pistons (Cade).   Rockets (Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun)"
"Alperen Sengun the best big of all time, man"
Alperen Sengun of all time is the best big man
Alperen Sengun the best big man
Evan Mobley needs to demand out of Cleveland   Scottie Barnes is basically LeBron James but high off crack   Giddey is the best Australian player in the League  Bouknight is a future scoring leader   Jalen Green is a Bust   Cade is ducking NBA comp   Brandon Boston is an Elite chucker  Davion Mitchell DPOY potential   Alperen Sengun is white Tim Duncan   Josh Primo is the coldest middle schooler the league has ever seen   Josh Christopher is the best shooter in the NBA   Trey Murphy is basically 6’8 klay Thompson   Franz Wagner is a bust  Justin Champaigne is the next Dennis Rodman   Cam Thomas has goat potential.   Chris Duarte is pretty good for a senior citizen

Kenyon Martin Jr. and Alperen Sengun are the two guys I'll stan in this squad. I didn't watch the game so can someone tell me how my boy Spencer Dinwiddie was ?
also notable: alperen sengun (the 2021 16th overall pick) looked good today despite what the stats say
Alperen Sengun  Look at his FT  He will get a ring and 2×MVP

"How does he compare to Alperen Sengun? He was someone who could pass, rebound, score, and rack of steals and blocks and went 16th this draft class. Looks like Jovic is a better 3 point shooter which is one thing that separates him."

Alperen Sengun after the first summer league game this year
"Alperen Sengun, Jalen Johnson, Quentin Grimes, Cam Thomas and Miles McBride were the 5 who I felt dropped too far."
"Alperen Sengun, the guy looks so calm, cool collected and under control. Makes scoring look easy. Major Luka vibes, but even less athletic."
Why did Alperen Sengun fall outside the top 2
Alperen Sengun looks like an absolute fucking stud in the summer league so far. Very easy to see why he won an MVP at 18 years old in Turkey in a league full of grown men
Alperen sengun
Throw him some extra points in for doing it against Nikola Jokic!  Edit: I spelled Alperen Sengun wrong my bad.
"Bro Alperen Sengun is nice af, I’m convinced this man is gonna be a problem"
Alperen Sengun is my hope for the future of post game
"be careful what u wish for  ""The Philadelphia 76ers have traded Ben Simmons and Tyrese Maxey to the Houston Rockets for John Wall, Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, and their 2022 first round pick"""
1. Cade Cunningham is not the next Luka Doncic. 2. Alperen Sengun is not the next Nikola Jokic. 3. The clippers will be a lottery team next season.
Caris LeVert. Dejounte Murray. Alperen Sengun. Keon Johnson. Kevin Porter Jr.
Alperen Sengun
"&gt; ""foreign proven talents""  &gt; darko milicic  Darko's pick was more like prospect than a proven player.  Check EuroLeague, EuroCup and domestic leagues stats of Pau Gasol, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis, Danilo Gallinari, Andrea Bargnani, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender and Alperen Sengun in their season before they were drafted. You should see that Luka and Pau were players that proven their worth in Europe and Bargnani, Bender and Darko were more like hopes as their stats weren't great enough yet."
"Gotta go with my man Stone... In less than one year, the Rockets went from Harden/Westbrook/Covington led team to a young core of:  Christian Wood Kevin Porter Jr.  Jalen Green  Kenyon Martin Jr. Jae'sean Tate Alperen Sengun Usman Garuba Joshua Christopher  And a crapload of future 1st round picks/swaps."
Alperen Sengun is fun to say
"I dont know what to do with my hands  -Alperen ""Ricky Bobby"" Sengun"
"Jalen Green failed to prove he should be the No.1 pick, it's Alperen Sengun."
"HIS NAME WAS ALPEREN SENGUN, HIS NAME WAS ALPEREN SENGUN"
0.5. Alperen Sengun
Alperen Sengun caught my eye
"Not true. He says he's saying stuff that motivates him like ""C'mon, I gotta do this, this shot's important etc.""  Here is an interview where he mentions it, if you speak Turkish:  https://www.eurohoops.net/tr/eurobasket-tr/1172714/alperen-sengun-eurobasket-2022de-belki-de-kupayi-kazanacagiz/"
[This dude was throwing around the idea of Segun at #1 before the draft ](https://deanondraft.com/2021/07/10/is-alperen-sengun-too-old-school-to-succeed-or-too-talented-to-fail/)
"I found an [interview](https://www.eurohoops.net/tr/eurobasket-tr/1172714/alperen-sengun-eurobasket-2022de-belki-de-kupayi-kazanacagiz/) in Turkish.   "" Its like a prayer. I'm trying to motivate myself by speaking to ball. I say things like ""You gotta make this shot! It's really important."" I think I need to change this ritual. Even my teammates told me to change it since It takes more than 10 seconds for me to use free throws. Not a problem in Turkish league but in Europe you receive a warning if it takes more than 10 seconds. I shoot better if I wait a little but if I rush it I miss. I will work on this."""
Alperen Sengun
"JG was as everything I had hoped for today but Alperen Sengun looked like a fucking pro out there.   15 pts, 15 rebs, 4 blocks + 3 assists."

"Alperen ""Billy Billy Billy"" Sengun on pace to set the summer league free throw record"
Alperen Sengun for the Rockets - 16th pick
Alperen Sengun. Green will be exciting to watch but I think Sengun‘s summer league play might give a good indicator on if the rest of the league severely underrated him in the draft. He was the MVP of the 3rd best domestic league in the world and I think there’s a chance he comes out and just absolutely dominates the summer league which would be super fun to watch.
I think everyone knew that Kemba with the injury he has and the amount he's owed was untradeable. Somehow worse than Kevin Love's contract. I mean you did get the 16th pick which was then traded to Houston for a few future firsts. So basically you flipped Horford to Boston for Alperen Sengun.   The Horford pick-up basically was a dump of Danny Green and Filler for a future 2025 First.  So netting Horford acquired one pick  Netting Kemba acquired one pick  The pick from Kemba was flipped for 2(?) picks
"Now: Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun and maybe Chet/Paolo next year."
"Thanks also if you want to include them here are the first round draft pick trades  * Knicks recieve: Hornets future first round, Hornets recieve: Pick 19 (Kai Jones) * Knicks recieve: Pick 25 and future 2nd rounder, Clippers recieve pick 21 (Keon Johnson) * Thunder recieve: 2 future picks, Rockets recieve: Pick 16 (Alperen Sengun)"
"He won’t have the narrative, but I think Alperen Sengun has the best chance. At 18 years old he dropped 20 ppg on 70% TS leading to an MVP in one of the best professional leagues in Europe. He should get plenty of touches in Houston, and I see nothing stopping him from putting up big numbers again."
"Alperen Sengun should be a PF btw not a C. He is 206 cm only, short for a C. He also played in PF position in Euroleague / Turkish league."
Stephen A Smith: *Alperen Sengun* should not be the face of the NBA!
Alperen Sengun is so happy... brought to you by Credit Karma.
Alperen “The Shogun” Sengun
"Worst draft pick of the night. The entire Spurs scouting team and management should be forced to donate their salary for the entire 2021-2022 season to a worthy charity. Seriously this guy had 1 team that had him as 1st round pick, they were drafting at the bottom of the draft. The Spurs must have forgotten it's 2021, and thought they were back in 2012 or something picking from the back of the draft order again.  I hope I'm wrong in this kid develops and becomes a star, but there is no way he becomes a star in time to make a difference next season. They need Big Men, they have 2 post players guaranteed on their roster for the 2021-2022 season and Keldon Johnson who's forced to play as a defacto big man. The Spurs actually have a solid young team, but there were two glaring holes. 1st they lacked talented big men. Kai Jones, Alperen Sengun, Usman... they had their pick at 12. They could have had a big that would help at least eat up some minutes next year.   At least at 41 they took a guy who can help with perimeter scoring, but he's another guard not a big. I'm hoping they are able to land some quality free agent biggs that went undrafted and again when NBA free agency started, but barring Kawhi coming back this pick likely means they might not win 25 games next year. What a terrible ending for a legendary coach.  The Spurs draft philosophy is just stupid and out of wack. Trying to be the smartest guys in the room, but actually doing dumb crap. The Spurs are a great organization and once again I hope I'm wrong, but some times doing what is 'expected' is the actual smartest thing you can do."
"No, it’s a bad pick because they already have the back court of the future in Fox and Hali.. there are still better prospects at the wing and forwards like Zhaire Williams, Moses Moody, Chris Duarte and big like Kai Jones or Alperen Sengun on the board..  Davion is not gonna be effective next to Fox and Hali and that is just not gonna help the Kings nor Davion develop anything"
"Alperen Sengun, no bias"
"Houston have to be the big winners so far. Next thing is to find moves for Gordon, House and somehow Wall, and then build around:   **PG:** Kevin Porter Jr, Josh Christopher.   **SG:** Jalen Green.  **SF:** Jae'Sean Tate.  **PF:** Christian Wood, KJ Martin.  **C:** Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba."
No interview or profile video for Alperen Sengun? Does ABC only care about prospects that speak english fluently?
"Alperen Sengun, on the other hand, will hold you close at night"
If Alperen Sengun keeps working hard he's got a chance to be the next Daniel Theis
"Just to put into perspective, the only euroleague prospects to win the respective MVP of their leagues, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Alperen Sengun."
Kevin Porter Jr   Jalen Green   Jae'Sean Tate   Christian Wood   Alperen Sengun  &amp;#x200B;  Damn...
Yeah I 100% agree. Alperen Sengun isn't even that hard to pronounce.
I don't even need to Google Alperen Sengun because I already know his comps are Enes Kanter and Furkan Korkmaz.
"The two pics are from Detroit and Washington, as per @KyleCohenNBA, the protections are:  ""According to  @espn_macmahon, the #Rockets traded the #Pistons 2022 1st round pick top 16 protected and the #Wizards 2023 1st round pick top 14 protected to the #Thunder for the 16th pick, where they selected rookie C-PF Alperen Sengun."""
Somewhat surprised there hasn't been much talk about Alperen Sengun. Admittedly haven't seen too much of him but the highlights I have seen look pretty damn good and he's high on a number of boards I've seen
Spurs gotta be kidding Alperen Sengun would be selected
"Jesus, I was really hoping for Alperen Sengun.."
"I'm gonna say this here so I can go back to it later. The Kings, and every team from now on, are gonna regret not picking Alperen Sengun."
Lmao hope the spurs get alperen sengun
Alperen Sengun lol

Alperen Sengun is going to be an allstar if his defense is semi competent.
"That's not a Jalen Rose thing, that's something that like 95% of all people do. The only time I've seen some people breaking that is recently a decent amount of people comparing Alperen Sengun to Al Jefferson."

They will draft Alperen Sengun just before us and I'll cry.
Alperen Sengun will become Minesota Kevin Love and end up a top 5 player in this draft. He'll either be drafted by OKC or outside the lottery
"Cade Cunningham will be a top 15 player by the end of his rookie contract.  There will be 30-40 legit NBA players to emerge from this draft, far more than average.  Alperen Sengun is outdated for this league and will peak as a bench offensive big.   Moses Moody will be on the all-rookie first team."
