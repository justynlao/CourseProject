"I mean Gonzaga has 3 players on the tankathon big board this year. Jalen Suggs (2), Corey kispert (8), and Joel ayayi (31). They’ll probably make NBA rosters. And I’d be willing to bet money on at least one other player currently on that team going in the first round either next year or the year after."
"Other people have mentioned this, but I think Kuminga falls. I think his reputation from preps play kept him high in mock drafts, but we are getting no buzz about some team being super into him and I just am not convinced he is actually that good or that high upside.   Assuming Barnes goes top 5, I think the Thunder take Giddey at 6, highest upside player they could find there.  If he falls past them, I actually think the Warriors take him.  And Magic take Moody if the Warriors don't.  Wagner goes to Kings at 9 and is actually a good pick.  Knicks draft Sharife, Thibs loves quick guards and they could use someone that can get to the rim and make plays even without spacing.  Their other pick could be a shooter, like Chris Duarte, a good fit in a Thibs offense, Corey Kispert, or Trey Murphy.  Bucks draft Joel Ayayi.  Might be wrong, but that is the vibe I get based on what I know of the sorts of players Bucks typically value.  All around player from a good NCAA team who can play off the ball well.  I could see them taking Neemias Queta too.  I think Keon Johnson might be a draft slider, while I think Springer actually goes to Pacers at 13.  Tough for non-shooting guards in the league, have to have special characteristics."
Also signed Austin Reaves and Joel Ayayi to two way contracts.
Man I was really hoping that undrafted FA Joel Ayayi would make the team.  It's getting pretty damn crowded though.l
Shocked Joel Ayayi went undrafted. That kid is special.
"Man, lowkey I’m disappointed. We could’ve had Daishen Nix (I’m unreasonably high on this guy, I think he’s a fantastic playmaker off the bench plus he’s got size and I bet we can make him buy into our defensive schemes) or Joel Ayayi but we drafted a Greek guy who I’ve never heard of before this Draft. Still, I have faith in our development team: if they can develop Nwora and Diakite to serviceable bench pieces, our rookies now might be good in 2-3 years."
"Sharife Cooper to ATL, but for real it's Joel Ayayi signing a two-way with the Lakers"
If Joel Ayayi didn’t play for Gonzaga he would have been a stud. Super high IQ who is an ELITE rebounder as a guard. Long and decently athletic. Not extremely explosive but very crafty. Improved three point shooter and defender. He has potential to develop into a starting PG if he continues to work on his body and can shoot at a high level in the pros. One of my favorite Zags and this was the perfect place for him!
"Joel Ayayi,THT and Caruso for Dame takes can begin"
Joel Ayayi for sure
i wonder who’s getting joel ayayi
"Joel Ayayi is a baller, great shot, plays all out all the time. I'm biased though as a Zags fan"
So the second round still has:   * Sharife Cooper  * Jared Butler  * Miles McBride  * Ayo Dosunmu  * Jason Preston  * Joe Wieskamp  * Isaiah Todd * Isaiah Livers * Joel Ayayi * BJ Boston  There's some really good talent in there.
"Lakers actually have 6 guys that meet the criteria of this post.   THT, Monk, Austin Reaves, Joel Ayayi, Chaundee Brown, and Mac McClung."
"Depends  https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2021/7/30/22602702/lakers-rumors-austin-reaves-joel-ayayi-turned-down-chance-get-drafted-sign-two-way-contracts  By not getting drafted in the second round, the player can  sometimes pick his team (eg that gives him best chance of success), rather than tryin to fight it out on the team that picked him  Beyond that, it's a matter of leverage for negotiation; G league player nor late 2nd round draft picks may both wind up with poor contracts. G league is worse, but it can limit the duration of your contract and allow you to hit your payday earlier/easier.  They are essentially betting on themselves as undrafted free agents. And if it doesn't work out, again as G league players"
"In the past 2 years, Wizards had 7 former Laker Players:  Isaac Bonga  Moritz Wagner  Thomas Bryant  Kyle Kuzma   Montrezl Harrell   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Joel Ayayi  If you jump back one more year, you can add Isaiah Thomas to the list too."
"As a Gonzaga fan I love this. Rui Hachimra, Corey Kispert and Joel Ayayi back together."
"That was me and they're still missing someone wearing #14 unfortunately. God damn you, Joel Ayayi."
Joel ayayi stats are impressive
"Joel Ayayi will make it up to you on the court.  He's a team player par excellence who shined at Gonzaga behind stars, and can do whatever his team needs without flinching.  He'll get his chance this season."
***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Some new Lakers jersey numbers have been released and now their roster looks like this:  * 0 - Russell Westbrook * 1 - Trevor Ariza * 2 - Wayne Ellington * 3 - Anthony Davis * 4 - Rajon Rondo * 5 - Talen Horton-Tucker * 6 - LeBron James * 7 - Carmelo Anthony * 8 - Retired for Kobe Bryant * 9 - Kent Bazemore * 10 - DeAndre Jordan * 11 - Malik Monk * 12 - Kendrick Nunn * 13 - Retired for Wilt Chamberlain * 15 - Austin Reaves * 17 - Joel Ayayi * 37 - Mac McClung * 38 - Chaundee Brown * 39 - Dwight Howard  Joel Ayayi blew it.
Also takes 8 connections to match Don Eliason who played 1 game for the celtics in 46-47 with Joel Ayayi who played 1 game for the Wizards this season. 9 seems impossible to find
"Joel ""Cardio"" Ayayi"
