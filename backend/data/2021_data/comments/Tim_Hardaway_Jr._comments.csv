"As my hero, Johnny Lawrence, said, “the best defense is more offense”. We should just double down on the offense. Let’s get Enes Kanter, Brook Lopez, Lou Williams, Kevin Love, Tim Hardaway Jr., Doug McDermott... can we bring back Marshon Brooks? He was always good for a bucket.   Realistically though, I'm beginning to think it'll be tough for us to fix the defense when you have Harden/Kyrie playing 30+ minutes a game. They can't guard anyone and they're getting destroyed on switches. We could have Ben Wallace or KG anchoring the D and it'll be brutal. At best, we should try to find ways to limit offensive rebounding/TOs and ways that can reduce opponent shot attempts, because they'll hit anywhere north of 45%.  Basically, if we get to shoot 5-10% more than the opponent does, then we'll probably win more than lose. Play to our strengths, Harden, Durant are good rebounders and any future PF/C we get should just be great at rebounding more than defense. Board and make good decisions should be our mantra."
"As a Suns fan who's seen a lot of similar issues around Book in previous years, this is my take.    Team comp-wise the Mavs have no secondary ball handler and the shooting around Luka is worse than last year. The loss of JJ Barea and Seth Curry is huge in terms of playmaking, shooting, spacing, and leadership. Also, Tim Hardaway Jr. is really the only other guy who can make his own offense. They drafted a few guys to make up for the playmaking losses, but they're not ready yet.    This team also has a leadership issue. Last year, Seth was hitting clutch shots when they needed it and Barea weathered the storm off the bench and made sure everyone else was ready when shit went down. Luka played great last year in part because he could share those leadership duties and focus on his own game. Now, it's all on Luka. He's gotta be clutch, be the best player, lead by example, be more vocal on and off the bench, everything. He put himself behind in that aspect when came in out of shape this season. Set the tone and mentality in the locker room and that's reflected in the way guys around him play. They don't give consistent effort and take shortcuts, expecting Luka to make all the plays and bail them out when things get tough. That's hard for a 3rd year player to deal with alone."
So he made a Tim hardaway jr. jr.
The rumor was Tim Hardaway Jr
Full Injury Report:  Luka Doncic (Hand Injury)   Kristaps Porzingis (Face Injury)   Tim Hardaway Jr (Face Injury)
"Who is the second one? Tim Hardaway Jr? Richardson? I think ""all star backcourt contender"" is a loose term for either player"
Jamal Murray slaps Tim Hardaway Jr in the nuts: Ejected  LeBron James dangerously pushes Joel Embiid midair: Stays in the game
"Gary Trent is like Tim Hardaway Jr, they both become Steph Curry clones against us. Nothing new"
&gt; Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of: &gt;  &gt; C: Willie Caulie Stein &gt;  &gt; PF: Wes Iwundu &gt;  &gt; SF: Tim Hardaway Jr. &gt;  &gt; SG: Josh Green &gt;  &gt; PG: Luka Dončić  The Mavs haven't started that lineup at all this season.
"Big difference between missing Seth Curry for 8 games, Furkan Korkmaz and Mike Scott vs missing Kristaps Porziņģis, Josh Richardson, Jalen Brunson, Dorian Finney Smith, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell, and then have Tim Hardaway Jr play through injury."
"Until recently we have been fielding a starting lineup of:   &amp;#x200B;  C: Willie Caulie Stein  PF: Wes Iwundu  SF: Tim Hardaway Jr.   SG: Josh Green  PG: Luka Dončić  with a bench of Boban, Nate Hinton, Tyrell Terry, James Johnson  &amp;#x200B;  Porziņģis came back a few games ago but is still rusty and until last night we had been missing 3-4 starters. We were 6-4 before COVID hit, keep in mind that was also without Porziņģis. We have not played a single game with our projected starting lineup.   If you watch our games you will see that Luka is the only reason we are near 0.500. We've been garbage without him on the court. This is also coming from a huge Luka critic. I can't deny the impact he's had on our team. His 3PT shooting has been bad, but he's also had no spacing, and defenders are not respecting our shooters, so the lanes are clogged and teams are able to triple team Luka and leave Iwundu, Green and WCS wide open. Iwundu and Green are shooting 14.3 and 9.1% respectively from 3 and they've been two of our starters the past month.   If Dallas is still treading water when the COVID guys are back and get their conditioning back, and Porziņģis is in his groove, then sure, there are some valid concerns, but as it stands now, Luka has kept us in the playoff race despite being down our 2nd-6th best players for over half the season."
It's still highway robbery. KP make Dallas become a good team from bottom-average team. Tim Hardaway Jr is a solid role player. Knicks got garbage players and two #20ish picks (2021 and 2023)
"Tim Hardaway Jr, dorian finney-smith, josh richardson and every pick available"
"Tim Hardaway being just a throw-in in this trade is crazy, reminds me of when the Knicks sent JR to the Cavs as a throw in with Shump lol"
mavs won the trade without question; they got KP and tim hardaway jr
Y’all had certified Rocket killer Tim Hardaway Jr. so I don’t want to hear it  But really I wasn’t able to watch the game. Didn’t know the Mavs were so banged up
"Once we have Kleber and Tim Hardaway Jr. back, plus a KP who has played a few more, we'll have a lot more consistent shooting."
Also Tim Hardaway Jr.
Tomorrow he is dropping 50 on ~us~ Tim Hardaway jr
You mean Tim hardaway jr

Tim Hardaway Jr.
"&gt; FG% says a lot about your shot selection.  I honestly disagree. FG% weighs all field goal attempts equally even though 3s are worth more than 2s. So even if you are shooting 3s at a great percentage, your overall FG% goes down because FG% just combines all shots together.   &gt;There are no players that only take 3s  Well yes of course, but it still is a problem to use FG% when it doesn't account for the extra point that you get for making a 3 pointer. Just to give a few examples Steph Curry, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mike Conley, and Donte DiVincenzo (all players with pretty differing playstyles btw) have a below league average FG% (46%), but an above average eFG% (53.2%).  I recommend that you please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/awL65UyXmA8) so you can understand what i mean"

"I could easily see Dallas taking a chance on him. He'd be a great perimeter defender alongside Luka, and we could have him play the 4.

"Starting lineup for our last game was - Doncic - Tim Hardaway Jr - Wes Iwundu - Willie Caulie Stein - Porzingis  we played a 9 man rotation featuring those 5 plus Josh Green, Trey Burke, James Johnson, and Boban  should look similar tonight"
Here are the players Lebron has primarily guarded this season:  DeMar DeRozan  Derrick Jones Jr.  Kyle Anderson  Keldon Johnson  Brandon Clarke  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Lonnie Walker IV  Rudy Gay  Eric Gordon  Devin Vassell  Coby White  Wendell Carter Jr.
This is almost certainly due to types of players LeBron guards and the types of shots they take: 48% of the shots against him have been 3PA.  Here are all the players who have taken 3+ shots against LeBron this year:  * DeMar DeRozan * Derrick Jones Jr. * Kyle Anderson * Keldon Johnson * Brandon Clarke * Tim Hardaway Jr. * Lonnie Walker IV * Rudy Gay * Eric Gordon * Devin Vassell * Coby White * Wendell Carter Jr.
You think if the Mavs didn’t have Luka or KP they’d be a competent team? Led by Tim Hardaway Jr.?
"Typical scoring numbers for a third option, Love gave you good rebounding though.   Eric Gordon in 18-19  17.8/2.5  Tim Hardaway Jr. In 19-20  17.8/3.5  Just to give a few examples, this Nets pre Harden trade would have been very comparable to the 2016 Cavs which is the point and I would have said better outside of the top player."
"Tim ""Moses"" Hardaway Jr."
Are we really pretending Tim Hardaway Jr. Is some kind of elite player. When he was on the Knicks he was viewed as a negative asset.
"yes, that’s the reason why! Because of Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney Smith and Maci Kleber!"
Plus Tim hardaway jr
"No its not. I would do anything to have my hopes crushed in the playoffs. And honestly seeing things like Porzingis traded for a 1st round pick, Tim Hardaway Jr signed to a $70 million dollar contract, getting the #3 pick where the 1 + 2 look like mega stars, are there own mini-hope crushers every year."

Tim Hardaway Jr. was at least worth the protected 1st rounder we owe the Knicks in a few years.   That means we got KP for this year's unprotected 1st rounder and Dennis Smith Jr. and nothing more aside from expirings we wouldn't have extended anyway.

Tim Hardaway Jr.
"Contextually, Rockets were missing half of their team for the first two games and only lost by a couple of points in OT to the Blazers.   CJ McCollum torched the team. Then the team's front court with skinny Wood got manhandled by Jokic.   They beat the Kings twice at home with Harden sitting out the second game after stepping on Wall's foot on an inbounds play.  They lost to the Mavs. Tim Hardaway Jr. torched the team with nine threes.  Harden looked a bit off with his ankle.  Against the Pacers, Brogdan had a career game and the Rockets couldn't play Christian Wood (bruised knee from bumping it in the Mavs game) or House (back spasms).  5 different starting line-ups in 6 games so the teams working out kinks."
"Well Dallas also has wing depth with JRichardson, Finney-Smith, Tim Hardaway Jr. Even guys like THJ who are quality players struggle to get 4th quarter time on that team"
"Top 6 for the Mavs is very easy.  1. Luka  2. Porzingis 3. J-Rich 4. Tim Hardaway Jr. 5. Maxi Kleber 6. Dorian Finney-Smith  7 is difficult, because it really comes down to how you build out the rest of the roster. It's Jalen Brunson, Trey Burke, Willie Cauley-Stein, James Johnson, Boban, or Dwight Powell."

"You think arguably the greatest player of all time wouldn't practice more on his 3-pt shot in the most 3-happy era in the game's history?

I'm not even claiming he'd be a ""great"" shooter either. I'm saying 37.5% on 8 attempts. Tim Hardaway Jr. is shooting 37.8% on 7.4 3PA per game. Devonte Graham shot 37.3% on 9.3 3PA last year. Terrence Ross shot 38.3% on 7.0 3PA two years ago. D-Lo has averaged 36.8% on 8.4 3PA over the past three seasons.  You're telling me these guys are better shooters than Jordan? That he can't do what they're doing at the very least, if not better?  It makes less sense to assume he wouldn't practice more, he wouldn't focus more on it, and that he wouldn't be a slightly above average 3-pt shooter if he played in this era.   The 3-pt average since he's retired has been right around 35-36%. Jordan isn't capable of that?"
I think he meant he'd take Tim Hardaway Jr over Lou Will
"I'm not a fan of people on this sub referring to Tim Hardaway Jr. as ""Timmy"""
Yeah Mavs fandom uses THJ for Tim Hardaway Jr and DFS for Dorian Finney Smith. It’s ok when talking to other Mavs fans but could def see why it would be annoying to literally anyone else.
That’s Tim Hardaway Jr
Tim Hardaway Jr and it's genuinely not even close here
Lou Will isn’t even that high of a standard lol. I’d probably take Tim Hardaway Jr over him.
Tim hardaway Jr and Dorian Finney-Smith. Unless you’re kidding lmao.
Tim Hardaway Jr so I can feel Giannis’ nuts on my face
 Fair enough  u/dallasmavs get:  Kevin Love  Matthew Dellavedova  u/cavs get:  Tim Hardaway Jr.  James Johnson  2021 - RD 2  2022 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/GAnl4zi8i
"&gt; Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com, the Dallas Mavericks feel Love would fix the problems they have had with three-point shooting and defensive rebounding:  &gt;”A source with knowledge of the Mavericks' thinking suggested Kevin Love as a much better fit [than Andre Drummond] given the team's 3-point woes and desire to surround MVP candidate Luka Doncic with shooters. Love would also help boost Dallas' problematic defensive rebounding metrics. Still, the Mavericks have two appealing expiring contracts—Tim Hardaway Jr. ($18 million) and James Johnson ($16 million)—that would help facilitate a deal.""  I apologize for the shitty headline, but I didn’t want to editorialize the link - I tried googling other sources, but only found even shittier headlines.  A “strong” fit =\= a better fit than Drummond"
"Luka KP Jalen Brunson Tim Hardaway JR  Maxi Kleber Dorian Finny Smith Willie Cauley Stein Trey Burke  Tough leaving Boban off the list, but these are definitely the 8 most important Mavs. Not sure anyone from our team would be taken tbh. Richardson, James Johnson, Powell, and Iwundu have been underwhelming and we haven't seen much of anything from our rookies yet"
He's got the green light to launch 3's at will but he's basically just an efficient version of Knicks Tim Hardaway Jr.
"this Thunder announcer needs to call DFS ""Tim Hardaway Jr"" one more time"
Lonnie Walker  Tim Hardaway Jr  Seth Curry
"In Fizdale's first season, in 18/19, the roster of the MY Knicks was pretty shite. Kevin Knox, Dotson, Vonleh and Mudiay played the most minutes. Ok, you also hat Tim Hardaway Jr with a massive 38% from the field. After that you had Trier, Mitchell Robinson and Hezonja. Knox, Vonleh, Mudiay, Trier and Hezonja are out of the league. It was the rookie season of Knox and Robinson.   That team was garbage.    19/20 was a better team, yes, but Julius Randle has made a big big step forward. All his stats improved while shouldering more responsibility and he is rightfully an allstar.  Barett is in his second year and has improved across the board.   It also helps that Thibs knows defense in a regular season with less rest."
"Mavs fans are fucking toxic. It's gotten to the point whre Porziņģis and Rick Carlisle and now Josh Richardson (formerly Tim Hardaway Jr.) get hate and are diminished in their value/impact as a means of propping Luka up.   Luka is incredible. Very likely he goes down as the Mavs GOAT if he stays here long enough. He for sure has the skillset. But you don't need to blame everyone else to make him look better. That sub has just basically become a Luka hivemind and then a ""no we shouldn't fire Rick Carlisle, or trade Kristaps Porziņģis and a first round pick for Andre Drummond"" minority.   The amount of hate Kristaps gets on there is unreal. He's our 3rd player to average 20+ ppg since Michael Finley in 2002, but you'd think he was Erick Dampier the way folks complain about him. He's barely removed from knee surgery and is still averaging 21 &amp; 8 on 47/36/84. Jaren Jackson Jr. had the same surgery 2 months before him and still isn't even back on the court.   It's just super reactionary over there."
"From what I've seen, New York was shopping him, he found out and was rightfully frustrated.  Dallas called about Tim Hardaway Jr. and they asked ""what do you think about Porziņģis?"" and then the trade went down. I don't think Porziņģis ever outright demanded a trade"
Tim Hardaway Jr
"players said last season in the bubble their depth perception was much better without a crowd there  ""Those in the league were less surprised that the bubble environment proved to be a shooter’s paradise. “It’s the same court every night,” said Rockets coach Mike D’Antoni. “You get your shooting, depth perception and all that.” The absence of fans not only eliminated distractions but also improved players’ sight lines. As Dallas Mavericks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. told The Ringer: “You can’t see through the backboard, shooting-wise, since it’s blacked out.” And don’t underestimate the impact of the benches moving farther away from the sidelines, costing teams the ability to scream at opposing shooters."""
"Tim Hardaway Jr was like: “Seriously bro, how do you do that?”"
Do you call Michael Porter Jr or Tim Hardaway Jr just 'Junior'?  Why not just call him Morris? It's like he's trying to force a nickname.
"it's a joke about the Porzingis trade  the actual trade was Dennis Smith Jr, 2 firsts and some filler for Tim Hardaway Jr, Porzingis and some filler  meta joke about everyone's hot takes on that trade from this week calling THJ the asset instead of Porzingis"
Tim Hardaway Jr over LeBron
bit misleading don't ya think?. recent lottery guy was dsj whose value was at its lowest. mavs also got tim hardaway jr. (the guy they initially approached the knicks for) and trey burke. Tim hardaway has been winning team defensive mvp belts and is a strong [6MOTY candidate](https://twitter.com/dmn_mavericks/status/1364085138087415808).
I mean we also got Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway Jr who have been fantastic  Hardaway Jr is averaging 17 points on nearly 60 TS% this season
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
Why is this particular dunk making r/nba so mad. Y’all never had this energy when it was Brandon knight From the DJ dunk. Or when Giannis jumped over Tim hardaway jr. Just enjoy the fun play. Y’all are mad weird
"I view Tim Hardaway Jr and Norm as very similar players. When they're hot they're hot, when they're not, they don't do much else. Both have the ability to drop 20+ every given night tho."
Tim Hardaway F’ing Jr
Tim Hardaway Jr turns into God from the old testament against us
Tim Hardaway Jr
"Tim Hardaway Jr. used to be one, but this year he’s toned down the chucking and actually seems willing to not shoot if he’s not feeling it"
"This list is garbage. Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jalen Brunson are the best duo in the league!  All kidding aside, CJ and Dame are way too low on this list I think."
"Jalen Brunson and Tim Hardaway Jr saved that game for us, Luka and WCS both played great too."
Tim Hardaway Jr wtf
Tim Hardaway Jr
Tim Hardaway Jr. HATES the hawks lmao
"&gt;: It's amazing how you can examplify what i was saying so effectively. On-off is more about who you play with then what you are contributing. As you explained so well.  It's amazing you can't understand the difference between on/off numbers between teammates and on/off numbers between #1 guys on different teams   &gt; ach Collins is poor often injured back-up center, the fact that you are counting him as a big ""missing piece"" kind of lets me know where you are at with this.   Bud I literally counted Dwight Powell.  And ""often-injured"" is hilarious when you're talking about Kristaps ""literally never finished a season healthy"" Porzingis.    &gt; Bottom line is that the Mavs have been missing large parts of their staring line-up and important bench guys for most of the season, to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Bottom line is that the blazers have been missing their 2nd AND 3rd best players for 12 out of the 23 games, have missed Zach Collins the whole season, and Derrick Jones Jr, Covington, Hood, Nassir, Anfernee have all missed more than one game.   &gt; to the point where there was only Doncic left in their original starting line-up.  Well that's just a flat lie because Tim Hardaway has literally played 24 games lmao.  They played maybe one game with no starters?  So same as us."
"Tim Hardaway Jr makes a lot of sense for Boston and even though a pick probably in the mid to late 20s is not enough for him, Dallas problem with this kind of deal is another: Who do they get back from a 3rd team? Knicks own the Mavs pick this season, so no tanking and the free agency argument is nonsense, because THJ is expiring and for any cap space his cap hold would have to be renounced anyway. Which player, better than Hardaway, could Dallas get for \~2 1sts plus some of their nice contracts?  This idea, naked as it is, makes no sense for the Mavericks."
"&gt;  the Nuggets should go all in. They control all of their first-round picks, so they could make a Brooklyn-esque type of offer  that's like...not true, they gave up a 2023 first for grant with protections that make 2025 untradeable too  &gt; Celtics send their unprotected first-round pick in 2021 to the Mavericks for Tim Hardaway Jr.  what the fuck  &gt; Bulls trade Zach LaVine to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks   is this article satire"
He seems like a Tim Hardaway JR player. He's better than Tim Jr but his stats are just empty. I'd love to see him as a sixth man or 3rd-4th option. This whole team is just mismanaged.
"Even if KP never plays another game, it's a wash because Dallas got THJ. New York will likely have two draft picks in the 15-25 range, they'd be lucky to draft a player as good as Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke."
"I think the playing minutes is a big difference.. Gordon 31mins avg with Clarkson 26mins aside the fact Gordon played starter most of the time. This is the same case for Tim Hardaway Jr., he has almost the same number but he's not 100% off the bench"
Tim Hardaway Jr when he plays the Rockets
Better Tim Hardaway Jr
Harrison Barnes=Tim Hardaway Jr.  Cant change my opinion
"Tim Hardaway Jr - 16.6/3.5/1.7 on 44.8%/39.5% total this season (49 games) In 29 games of the bench 16.4/3.3/1.5 on 46.1%/40.3%, 20-9 record (.690) 3 made threes a game, he's 11th in the league in 3s made - 146."
"Would be great if we could get a bigger sample size. Also, get feet data for guys like Austin Rivers, Klay, Steph, Tim Hardaway Jr. and other players that were pretty well off. So, we can get better idea if wearing smaller size shoes due to poverty has some correlation to ugly feet."
"I only watch Tim Hardaway Jr. when he plays us and I still don't understand how he isn't an all-star. I have never seen him miss a 3, and his handle against us becomes like prime CP3 combined with Kyrie"
Tim Hardaway Jr
Let me introduce you to Tim Hardaway Jr
"You know who hustles on defense  Tim Hardaway Jr, every day he hustling  Still atrocious though, it's quite sad"
Tim Hardaway Jr count?
This is hella disrespectful to Jalen Brunson &amp; Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Morris is very good.
Tim “Jason Terry” Hardaway Jr
tim hardaway jr has improved his effort on defense by about 10000% over the last 2 years but he's still next to useless
Tim hardaway jr is having a better season than clarkson
"&gt; I don't expect him to win but I'll be shocked if he doesn't get significant votes this year.  You might be shocked. He's having a nice season but there are several others having a better or equal shot at it than him. Barring injury, Clarkson is most likely winning it. Other strong candidates are Harrell, Boucher, Ingles, and maybe biased but Tim Hardaway Jr and Jalen Brunson should get some votes."
Reminds me of how we got Kristaps Porzingis as a throw in on the trade form Tim Hardaway Jr!
Lots of great players come off the bench. I think both Jalen Brunson and Tim Hardaway Jr. for example are better players than Oubre.
Lol Tim Hardaway Jr is better then anything the Mavs gave up including the picks
No one said he's a star lmao. Replace him with Tim hardaway jr and they still get destroyed. Thj is a good player right?   Good is relative. Wiggins is a good role player.
Luka  KP  Tim Hardaway JR  Jalen Brunson  Maxi Kleber  Josh Richardson  Dorian Finney Smith  Willey Cauley Stein  Trey Burke
"I would have Tim Hardaway Jr in there, he's been great of the bench."
My brain:  Tondae Hollis Jefferson? Tennis Hmith Jr? Talen Horten Jucker? Oh Tim Hardaway Jr okay
Tim Hardaway Jr and Maxi Kleber
Giannis did it to tim Hardaway Jr. So I don't see why not
Consistent is NOT the word I’d use to describe Tim Hardaway Jr.   But he has been significantly more consistent this year since he’s developed a driving game that he didn’t have before
"Tim Hardaway Jr. is such an underrated 6MOTY candidate and should be getting more spotlight. But I won’t mind if Clarkson wins it, but Hardaway is a bonafide candidate with those scoring splits."

"Luka comes into the season in the best shape of his life and we land Kawhi in free agency this offseason for some crazy reason, the Mavs get the top seed in the west, with Luka winning MVP in 50/40/75 splits and a 33 point triple double as an average for the season.  Kawhi and Luka get All Nba first team, with Porzingis getting into the third team, and Tim Hardaway Jr wins sixth man of the year.  The Mavs get to the NBA finals, where they beat the Nets in 7 games with a game winning stepback 3 from Luka. He gets FMVP."
Tim Hardaway Jr. begs to differ.
Why is tim hardaway jr always so good against the Clips
Tim Hardaway Jr.
Jamal Murray is Tim Hardaway Jr. on steroids.
"He apparently likes Dallas, but I don’t see it happening this trade deadline since he fills the same role as Tim Hardaway Jr., who’s on a cheaper and expiring contract. If THJ walks this summer and Hield is still in Sacramento next season, I could see the Mavs making a play for him then."
Tim hardaway Jr
"Pretty much any of the Spurs guards, a few of the Dallas players like Jalen Brunson, Tim Hardaway Jr, Maxi Kleber and Dwight Powell  They seem great and they’ve impressed when I’ve seen them but no idea how consistent they are or how the factor into the teams plans and futures or how good they are really"
"What surprises me is how massive the “normal tall” guys look in real life. Like 6’-6’6” range. I met Kent Bazemore and Tim Hardaway Jr. at a charity event a couple years ago and they look absolutely swoll in person (especially THJ).

You could find guys like Dejountae Murray, Kelly Oubre (yes I know), Lonzo Ball, Tim Hardaway Jr, even Harrison Barnes.  I tried to choose guys not on rookie contracts cuz that’s not fair.  What about 3 cheaper players from Minnesota? I’m sure that would’ve been more value. Honestly Wiggins isn’t better than your average player. Grabbing three average players in a trade for D Lo would have added depth."
DJ Augustin  Gary Trent Jr.  Jerami Grant  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Nikola Vucevic  Dillon Brooks  Dorian Finney-Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr. (Love that guy tho)

"Im going to assume you don’t realize why Tim Hardaway Jr. needs to come off curls and needs screens in order to get his shot off, so i’ll explain it to you. In basketball there is a thing called dribbling, or ball handling if you will, which allows a player to move their feet freely without travelling. The player in question, Tim Hardaway Jr., is not great at it, and cannot consistently create his own shoot, so he needs good passers like Luka Doncic and screeners in order to get open. Kevin Durant meanwhile, can dribble at a level higher than a guy at the local ymca and thus, is able to get open off the dribble, minimising his reliance on back screens, elevator screens, horns, curls, etc. They are two different players, one can shoot off the dribble and, for that matter, in any other setting, while the other needs plays drawn up in order to get his shot off. There’s levels to this"
"Because surprisingly, stats aren’t everything. What do you want me to do, pick you up and watch hours upon hours of film with you? I’m not doing with that. There are some things in basketball that are confirmed by something called the “eye test”, which is another way of saying judging someone based upon you own observations. Every sane person who has ever watched basketball will tell you KD is one of the best three point shooters the game has ever seen. Stats may tell you Tim Hardaway Jr. is better, but that’s just not true, and you know it."
"You make me physically ill. I hope you have fun watching Tim Hardaway Jr. in the playoffs, I have pretty high hopes considering he’s a better three point shooter than KEVIN DURANT. Exit basketball reference for a few hours and turn on a basketball game, preferably a Nets game,it’s pretty fun. Let me know how it goes! The goal is to score more than the other team, and they have 4 12 minute quarters, a total of 48 minutes of game time, to beat their opponent. It’s a fun sport, hope your first time watching it goes well."
It’s kinda like earlier this season where Jamal Murray inadvertently hit Tim Hardaway Jr. in the nuts and got ejected
this trick works wonders for tim hardaway jr
They didn’t have Tim Hardaway Jr so we were fine
I hear Tim Hardaway Jr.'s music.
Unless your Tim Hardaway Jr
I call that the Tim Hardaway Jr. effect
I find it weird how players can turn it on like that when family is in attendance.  Tim Hardaway jr scored a career high the other night with his dad in the audience and I saw a game a while back where Michael Porter Jr went off while his dad was in attendance.  It makes it seem like they're not really trying during other games.

"Tim ""Shawty in tha club"" Hardaway Jr."

"Tim ""randomly the best player in the league one game a year"" Hardaway Jr strikes again"
Ah but do you believe in worker's rights? The worker's came together and unionized. They agreed on a cba. The cba creates a salary cap that is tied to 50% of league revenue.    We are going to purchase the product. The only question is whose pocket does our money go into?    One of the reasons that I love the nba is that a guy like tim Hardaway Jr can make more money than your favorite NFL all star running back.    I agree wealth disparity is a HUGE problem but I consider nba players to be specialized worker's who deserve a high salary commensurate with the money they bring in

What's kinda funny is that even with the great turnaround I wouldn't be surprised at all if they sort of blow the team up.  Tim Hardaway JR and Josh Richardson are both free agents.  I have my doubts Mavs want to retain either for what they cost.  Porzingis and Luka together on the court (when he even plays) is barely positive.  Luka without Porzingis net rating would be 3rd in the NBA.
"Maxi Kleber, Dorian Finney-Smith, Tim Hardaway Jr, Jalen Brunson, KP are not trash lol"
I made a whole spreadsheet before realizing I forgot to take position into account.  Top 5 scoring teams are as follows if we're playing positionless and/or small-ball:  |*Team MB -  79.9 PPG*|*Team DB -  77.6 PPG*|*Team JH -  76.5 PPG*|*Team BB -  76.1 PPG*|*Team TH -  72.4 PPG* | |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Malcolm Brogdon - 21.2|Devin Booker - 25.4|James Harden - 25.2 |Bradley Beal - 31.3|Tobias Harris - 20| |Malik Beasley - 19.6|Dillon Brooks - 16.7|Jrue Holiday - 17.3 |Bojan Bogdanovic - 15.7|Tim Hardaway Jr. - 16| |Marvin Bagley III - 13.9|Darius Bazley - 13.4|Joe Harris - 14.5 |Bogdan Bogdanovic - 15.2|Tyler Herro - 14.9| |Mikal Bridges - 13.1|Davis Bertans - 11.4|Justin Holiday - 10.3 |Bruce Brown - 8.8|Tyrese Haliburton - 12.8| |Miles Bridges - 12.1|Dwayne Bacon - 10.7|Josh Hart - 9.2|Bismack Biyombo - 5.1|Talen Horton-Tucker - 8.7|
"I’d imagine 20/yr average would be about the minimum for Mikal. He’s about as good as a 3&amp;D(+) player gets, in his 3rd year, and is bound to only improve. Also considering that it includes 8% annual raises, the first year number is well below 20M if that’s the average. 18M in two years time is less than Tim Hardaway Jr makes this year — he’s no longer considered a bad salary and Mikal is ... more desirable."
Tyler Herro  Tyrese Haliburton  Tim Hardaway Jr.  Talen Horton-Tucker  Tobias Harris  lol. no active big available

Tim Hardaway Jr
"From now on, the KP trade is the Tim Hardaway Jr Trade."
trey burke is a cool dude  EDIT: tim hardaway jr is also a cool dude
"I'm frankly more impressed that a lineup with Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee, and Enes Kanter held another team scoreless for 5.5 minutes to make that run."
That 28-0 was just 3 players. Points during the run    Tim hardaway jr:  12   Courtney Lee:  9   Enes Kanter:  7
Other than probably Giannis jumping over Tim Hardaway Jr
"Honestly part of our problem is our roster Construction and the way we set our starting lineup. Outside of Luka and KP usually Dorian Finney we don't have a lot of players I would label as true starters. No one on our team plays defense and it doesn't seem like a lot of our team understands rotations very well, and we our way over paying a couple players for the production they're giving us. Dwight Powell and Tim Hardaway Jr are making like 31 mill combined too"
Tim Hardaway Jr is so frustrating to watch because while I understand that his average is right about 15 to 16 points a game that's not how he scores his points he's either going to score 22 or score like 4 on 18 shots. I also think he takes way too many inefficient mid-range shots he either needs to drive or shoot threes because he's not nearly as good as he thinks he is at creating his own shot off the dribble
Someone’s gotta want to take some shots here and his name can’t be Tim Hardaway Jr lol
"AG is a big, athletic wing with some real foot speed, which is right now the best defender against Luka, but pretty much only when paired with another really long player to double team him. That way he can't just throw a (for him) easy pass over his defenders and I don't really like Denvers options for the second guy, because I don't trust MPJ yet to do it smartly. AG would probably do a fine job, but Luka gets his.  Denver has a better way to beat Dallas, than trying to slow down Doncic and that is to kill the Mavs with Jokic owning the post. With his passing, scoring, offensive rebounding, nobody on the Mavs roster seems like a reasonable option against Nikola, except maybe a Boban surprise, but that wouldn't work for a full series.  I've seen Murray in the playoffs, but that doesn't change my opinion very specifically on his effectiveness against the Mavs, he has struggled against Dorian Finney-Smith and even Tim Hardaway Jr a lot. Denver is obviously better with Murray, but they would miss him more against pretty much every other team in the West and even without him they are imo a slight favourite against a fully healthy Dallas roster."
Tim Hardaway Jr is the best bad player in the league. There is absolutely no debate about it.
Between this and the video of Tim Hardaway talking about Timmy Jr.  the other day I've really enjoyed NBA players talking about their kids
Tim Hardaway Jr is fuckin killing me rn
"On the subject of Steve Mills fuckups, remember how he was sole authority for one week before Scott Perry was hired, and used that week to sign Tim Hardaway Jr to that albatross contract?"
"My thing is yes Curry helps him, but I think Draymond would help expand any elite scorer, and be insanely impactful it doesn’t have to be Steph. He’d look great with Lavine on the Bulls, and probably drag them to a good defense.   Through most of last season, he wasn’t even playing with a scorer as talented as like a Jordan Clarkson or Tim Hardaway Jr. with D Lo injury, that team was straight garbage."
Tim Hardaway Jr was like the only person in the world who knew it was a 3 everyone else wasn't sure
I think the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade was solid for the Mavs.
"- We look tired, Luka is clearly playing through a knee injury and Maxi Kleber has taken a hit from COVID and leg injuries. It also doesn’t help that we play a short rotation of Luka/Richardson/Finney-Smith/Kleber/KP with Brunson, Tim Hardaway Jr as the only players getting significant bench minutes. Powell lately has been getting minutes, but Cauley-Stein is has just come back from protocols, so he probably takes up a few minutes. Melli the first few games with us was a nice stand-in for Maxi in the rotation, however his minutes have decreased  - Our defense hasn’t looked good last few games, yesterday we gave up 45 in the 2nd quarter vs the Kings without putting up much effort on that end.   - Richardson certainly isn’t what we have hoped for, the only consistent shot creator outside of Luka is Brunson, who mainly creates for himself. We need to pick up a secondary ball-handler, so that we can prevent the heliocentric offense that we are running now, which is tiring on Luka.  - We have a tight schedule, which I don’t want to blame, as we are losing against teams we should win against, like the Rockets and Kings. On the other hand, we put up great wins against Milwaukee and Utah. Other teams deal with tight schedules as well. Also, we had about a week break due to the snowstorm in Texas, which gave us some time to reset (with instant positive effect, however not in the long run).   We have to reset this week, big back to back games against the Lakers are coming up with the first game against the Lakers on the second night of a b2b after a game against the Pistons. If we go 3-0 in this stretch (which I honestly doubt, even with AD and LeBron being out), we have regained a good chance of getting the 6th seed. If we don’t get the 6th seed, it has to be mostly put on ourselves and not on outside factors."

"Giannis did dunk over Tim Hardaway Jr. in the last few years, but Giannis was super humble about it and requested it not be made into t-shirts and shit if I remember correctly."
Why would you want to put in the effort to do a DeMar sign and trade for JRich and Tim Hardaway JR?
Tim Hardaway jr. and Zach Lavine
"Lets see... We gave up Dennis Smith Jr. (no longer on the Knicks), Deandre Jordan (no longer on the Knicks), Wes Matthews (No longer on the Knicks) and two FRP's that - despite what braindead Knicks fans believe, will not be in the lotto. We got KP, an All Star Player who is worth that 'haul' plus much more, and Tim Hardaway Jr. who has become a key contributor. Yeah I'd say we won the trade. Only delusional Knicks fans could see that and believe they won. But keep defending your shitty franchise, I kinda pity you guys."
Tim Hardaway Jr?
"My God is The Son of Tim Hardaway, Tim Hardaway Jr."
"Ironic.  &gt; Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. **It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry** and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason.

But team sources say Voulgaris was supportive of the transactions — or explicitly approved them."
Yeah he's essentially what happens if you give a solid starter the #2 role and treat him like he's a star.  Like just tell Tim Hardaway Jr. he's the 2nd best player on the team and give him 21 shots a night. He'll average 20 every year too.
"Is it not because the significant increase in players salary over the years. Rookie deals now are comparable to “max” money from 1998. The Salary cap was $26 Million in 1998. That’s Otto Porter Jr’s average annual salary. Magic Johnson’s 25 year, $25 million dollar contract ($1 Mil/year for 25 years) was the largest contract in SPORTS history when it was signed in 1981. Adjusted for inflation that’s $71 Million in today’s dollars. $71mil/25yrs. To put it into perspective, Tim Hardaway Jr contract was $71 million over like 4 years."
Giannis’ best dunk was the one where he cleared Tim Hardaway Jr on the oop
"Also, the article says he supported trading Curry for Richardson  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Because Voulgaris’ influence was greater than his official role, those within the front office — and executives around the league who interacted with them — were often confused about who actually held power. “We had two general managers,” a team source says.

"Considering the fact that everyone around him is a glorified role player, it’s not really surprising. After him the next most consistent player is Tim Hardaway Jr.  He’s only been in the league for a few years but the FO has mostly fumbled around."
"They 1000% could have gotten Tim Hardaway Jr from the Knicks for Dennis Smith Jr and a future first round pick (they actually originally called the Knicks about THJ and the Knicks were like ""Sure but how do you feel about Porzingis?""). In fact, they probably could have gotten him for one or the other. Their decision to max Porzingis before ever seeing him play for them after he just missed a season and a half is a completely different thing."
"They should just fire Nelson for these terrible moves. At some point the credit given for drafting Luka has to run out.   &gt;Nelson continued to spearhead major moves, including trades for Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. in 2019, Josh Richardson in 2020 and J.J.

Outside some late firsts I’d rather have Tim hardaway jr than Dennis smith jr. The problem is the cap hit for pozingis. They can hope that someone else’s problem matches up.
"Dallas announced Voulgaris’ hiring in the fall of 2018 with a title — director of quantitative research and development — that vastly understated his actual role. Multiple league and team sources tell The Athletic that Voulgaris has been the most influential voice within the Mavericks front office since joining the team, either initiating or approving virtually every transaction made over the past two seasons. Those same sources add that Voulgaris has frequently gone as far as scripting the starting lineups and rotations for longtime head coach Rick Carlisle.  That influence has spanned Doncic’s three seasons in Dallas. While he had been drafted prior to Voulgaris’ arrival — Donnie Nelson, the team’s longtime president of basketball operations, was the driving force behind trading up to acquire the Slovenian wunderkind, a process he described in detail to The Athletic last year — Cuban had sought out Voulgaris’ basketball advice in the years before putting him on the team’s payroll. As one team source says, “Mark Cuban is the most powerful person in the organization, but whoever he’s listening to is second.” Cuban was won over by Voulgaris’ vision: an analytics-driven spread pick-and-roll offense with Doncic as the focal point which he has tried implementing in the past seasons.  It’s unclear when the Cuban and Voulgaris relationship began, but their coming together is perhaps unsurprising given Cuban’s origin as a self-made tech billionaire whose first major purchase was the Mavericks. Voulgaris has never been shy about his desire to run a team. In an ESPN feature from 2013, Voulgaris is quoted as saying, “The whole process (of becoming a highly successful gambler) has led me to believe that I’d be able to put together a better team than almost any general manager in the league. If not maybe all.”  The way Voulgaris tells it — the ESPN feature is the only notable reporting ever focused on him, and he declined an interview request from The Athletic shortly after being hired — he began gambling on the NBA in the late 1990s and had made millions by the early 2000s. His success, he says, came in part from an instinctual reading of certain coaches. It finally failed him during the 2003-04 season, causing him to lose much of his gambling wealth and step away temporarily, only returning once he’d developed an analytics model that brought back his old edge. He says he did exactly that, his new model beating the odds at a rate higher than five percent. In 2009, he gave up gambling again to consult for an unnamed NBA franchise. The advisory role lasted one season; he returned to his previous life afterward and began publicly promoting himself. In the coming years, he became a well-known presence in the basketball world.  Voulgaris spent a limited amount of time around the Mavericks during his first season of employment, attending about one-quarter of the team’s games. He attended fewer games the following season, but his imprint on the team’s roster grew substantially that offseason. It was Voulgaris who initiated the team’s acquisitions of Seth Curry and Delon Wright, with multiple sources telling The Athletic that Voulgaris believed Wright should start next to Doncic. “He was the only person that believed that,” one team source says. Wright did start the season opener before being moved to a full-time bench role the following game, barely playing in the team’s first-round defeat in the 2020 postseason.

"I’m not sure why the same clause wouldn’t be triggered... maybe so the teams losing the player at least have a chance at recouping some value? Your guess would be as good as mine here.    As for the Lakers... I think Schroder ends up getting signed and traded. I have two destinations/scenarios in mind.    Mavericks receive: Dennis Schroder    Lakers receive: Tim Hardaway Jr.    Dallas gets another ball handler to take some of the workload off Luka, Lakers get a knockdown shooter to pair with LeBron and AD.    This next one is a little creative:    Knicks receive: Dennis Schroder    Raptors receive: assets from NY    Lakers receive: Kyle Lowry"
&gt; Because the rest of the team is pretty damn good  Is it? His second best player is Tim Hardaway Jr
The Tim Hardaway Jr to Paul George’s Kristaps Porzingis

Clippers closing out like they went against Luka and Tim Hardaway jr last round
Cuz Luka just averaged 36/8/10 and pushed a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to 7 games while having a role player Tim Hardaway Jr as his 2nd best player
I'm a Celtics fan and my perception of Khris Middleton was WAAAAAYYYY off. He is not Kobe Bryant when he's not playing us and looks like a poor man's Tim Hardaway Jr.
"They have a third guy, Tim Hardaway Jr., they are missing a second guy, which was supposed to be KP."
fun fact: porzingis was a throw-in as part of the tim hardaway jr trade
I mean Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jalen Brunson are capable offensive scorers and to a lesser extent playmakers
The New York Knicks won the Tim Hardaway Jr trade.
hes not wrong.  offense this playoffs was basically...  Luka. dribble. get switch. take whatever shot he wants. Luka. dribble. kick it out to someone then disappear literally offscreen and do nothing. watch team make a 3 or miss. 15%tim hardaway jr makes a layup. repeat.  there is no way for porzingus to get in a rhythm at all. plus its not like the Mavs are good at creating plays outside of Luka.   just a bad combo for KP.
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
This can't be good for team chemistry. Forget about Luka. Imagine you're Tim Hardaway Jr or Dorian Finney-Smith and just got done playing your ass off for a fraction of KP money while this guy stood around.
"To be fair, Dallas did get tim hardaway jr in the trade"
Tim Hardaway SR/JR
"I still believe that the Tim Hardaway JR contract was a bad one. He never performed for us like he did in Atlanta or is performing in Dallas because he was a 2nd scorer here with no playmaker. He went off occasionally but he could never achieve what he’s getting in Dallas because we just don’t have a playmaker.   Also it was a Steve Mills signing and we all attributed it to him, so if it’s a good contract then we gotta give props to Mills which is something that I cannot do."
"True, you really can't judge these things as they go. In hindsight, though, it made some really shitty circumstances to the team. Nobody really thought KP would fall off the cliff like that. Everybody thought this team needed defense, grit. Obviously the trade pieces they got to alleviate that deficiency didn't work. James Johnson got traded mid-season, KP lost his blocking ability, Richardson is trash outside of that good season in Miami.   Nobody thought Luka would leap up and become a good defender. DFS became an Iguodala-type swiss army knife. Dwight Powell stopped being a turnstile.   But that trade definitely reduced their offense terribly. At the time when Dallas needed any offense, they couldn't buy a shot to save their lives. Surely a 45% 3 point shooting guard named Curry who just shot 21 and 30 his last two games would've helped that team. We know Tim Hardaway jr couldn't handle 2nd option night in and night out, why not just run it the same as last year and have them share wing duties?   In theory, that trade would've worked. A defensive minded play-making guard might've worked well with Luka. But, in my opinion, recreating those Lebron-led teams would've been the way to go. Give Luka 2 reliable shooting wings, a defensive minded power forward, a sturdy center that wouldn't have problems posting up the likes of Reggie Jackson, and this team would've gone farther than Game 7 of the first round.   But I digress.  I just hope management has something in line to help Luka get out of this first round hump. Mike needed a couple of years getting out of Detroit and Boston's shadows. Luka probably needs one more getting out of Clip's. It's a generational player's rite of passage."
"never thought I'd be defending him but he's looking better and better in hindsight. He drafted KP when no one else saw anything in him and then he wanted to trade him when his stock was as high it could be (everyone thought he was a crazy). It's like he saw the talent but then when he got to know him he saw that the ceiling was limited. Meanwhile, he signed Tim Hardaway Jr and now that contract looks pretty good."
He was just collateral in the Tim Hardaway Jr trade
He already seems to be doing well with Luka and Tim Hardaway JR. I think the problem lies in the fact that they need more impactful players on the court.
"Apparently Kristaps was a package deal. They wanted to get Tim Hardaway Jr., but they also had to take Kristaps, which wasn't what they wanted. So yeah. Kristaps is basically the kid that nobody wants in the NBA at this point."
"I feel like that's harsh.   We all thought Dallas fleeced the Knicks for KP, and Tim Hardaway Jr. was thrown in as cap filler and proved to be a super helpful player. Also Finney-Smith and Kleber may not be playmakers, but are both helpful role players on team-friendly deals. Brunson was a 2nd round pick. Dwight Powell had great P&amp;R chemistry with Luka before tearing his achilles.   And yeah, you can't gloss over how great of a trade the Luka trade was.  In my view this pretty much comes down to KP being injury prone and not gelling with Luka. The Seth Curry trade was also a miss, but if anything aimed to satisfy their need of that 2nd ball handler and not just be Luka, KP + shooting.  But that's still an insanely productive last 3 years transitioning out of the Dirk era, especially when compared to a team like the Spurs post Duncan."
Respect Tim Hardaway Jr
Someone is going to overpay Tim Hardaway Jr.
"Kenyon Martin Jr/Sr, Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr, Gary Payton II/Sr, Cole Anthony/Greg Anthony (never realized he was his son until just now), Seth and Steph Curry/Dell Curry, Austin Rivers/Doc Rivers, Glenn Robinson III/Glenn Robinson Jr, Domantas Sabonis/Arvydas Sabonis, Jerami Grant/Harvey Grant (and uncle Horace Grant)...  There's so many more current players whose fathers played but I don't remember watching their fathers... it's crazy..."
maybe a sign+trade with tim hardaway jr then?
Tim Hardaway Jr. thought he was Tim Hardaway
I think it is revisionist to act like Cuban and the mavs weren’t thinking straight when they traded for him. Tim Hardaway Jr was worth it almost alone.
"Ya, Young did not play the Clippers. RJ Barrett and Julius Randle is not in the same conversation as Kawhi and PG.  Not to mention that Luka has Tim Hardaway JR as the only respectable teammate where as Young has a decently built roster.  Garbage takes as usual 1 minute after a series lmao."
"If Tim Hardaway Jr is your second best player that’s not a good thing.   Dude is great and has been amazing for the Mavericks, don’t get me wrong, but any team with Tim Hardaway Jr as their second best player ain’t gonna make it very far.  Also the picks kind of screwed you guys in terms of not being able to trade them because you gave away two and the others are locked in as a result"
"It only cost them two first round picks, Dennis Smith Jr and some expiring contracts, and part of the ""cost"" was taking on Tim Hardaway Jr, who has been a key player for them for two years. The Mavs legitimately got the two best players out of the deal. Calling it one of the worst trades ever made is nuts."
Yeah the Mavs definitely won the trade just for Tim Hardaway Jr. alone
wasnt the biggest piece going the other way Dennis Smith Jr? seems like even if KP flames out it was worth it with the emergence of Tim hardaway jr
"Eh, The Mavs were pretty insane in the first two games. Tim Hardaway Jr averaged like 25ppg on 80ts%, with some ridiculous shooting from Smith and co."
Knicks won the trade also from this point on it should be called the Tim Hardaway Jr trade
Mavs need a 3rd star to pair with Luka and Tim Hardaway Jr
Well they just scraped past a team who has Tim Hardaway Jr as their second best player lol. And they still not as shit as the Knicks who have zero real stars on their team.
Doncic and his second 'star' Tim Hardaway Jr just took two superstars to 7 games   Sixers first round wins have been flukes because you're getting sonned by a guy with pubes on his face who everyone says is worse than Luka lol...
Luka is incredible but if your second best player is Tim Hardaway Jr you won't go far
"If GSW doesn't get Wolves draft this year, try to get Tim Hardaway Jr in FA."
It would be so Clippers to blow this lead to like Tim Hardaway Jr hitting 5 three's or something lol
"“PLEASE, BASKETBALL GODS. LET TIM HARDAWAY JR. MISS ONE THREE.” Meanwhile he was probably like 4-10"
Tim hardaway jr is listed as stats owner for both lines
Tim Hardaway Jr is actually sneaky athletic
"Tim Hardaway Jr wearing denim jeans and an oversized sweater?  Yup, 1997 confirmed photo."
If you watched the knicks during that year Tim Hardaway Jr did not look good. He obviously has flourished in his new team but he wasn't a valuable asset at the time
"Because people now realise the second best player on the Mavs is fucking Tim Hardaway Jr and Luka is carrying hard vs Trae who has Collins, Capela and a bunch of better role players on his team"
"Tim """"Nba player"" Nba player parent to Tim """"Nba player"" Nba player son"" Hardaway Jr"" Hardaway Sr"
"Shows how long Vince Carter been in the league, he played against Gary Trent Sr/Jr, Kenyon Martin Sr/Jr, Dell/Steph/Seth Curry, Arvydas/Domantas Sabonis and Tim Hardaway Sr/Jr."
What about Tim Hardaway (retired '03) and Tim Hardaway Jr? Doesn't that count as the third?
"I saw it in a dream last night:  Mavs win 129-115.  Unfortunately Tim Hardaway Jr. also tore his ACL in the dream.  Don't worry, if I possess any psychic ability my bet365 balance would be a lot higher."
"Not necessarily: ""Because they (Mavs) called for Tim Hardaway Jr. . . . ""  Sounds reasonable to me. KP was considered a 7'2 ""Unicorn"" at the time and those types never get traded so it must have come as a shock when the Knicks put him on the table."
"&gt; he’s playing far far superior defense      I would not say it's ""far"" superior.        Here are the defensive numbers for Jokic against players he guarded for more than 5 minutes.    Kanter - 40% (2-5)     Lillard - 46% (12-26)      Nurkic - 41% (12-29)       Average - 43% (26-60)       For Kawhi...     Tim Hardaway Jr - 52.9% (9-17)      Maxi Kleber - 75% (3-4)     Luka Doncic - 38% (9-24)       Kristaps Porzingis - 46% (5-11)      Dorian Finney Smith - 17% (1-6)       Average - 38% (27-72)  For Luka...      Reggie Jackson - 67% (6-9)      Rajon Rondo - 17% (1-6)     Paul George - 29% (2-7)    Nicholas Batum - 38% (3-8)     Marcus Morris Sr - 33% (3-9)     Kawhi Leonard - 50% (7-14)       Average - 42% (22-53)       They are all terrific. Yes, Kawhi has been better on that end. But it's not ""far far"" superior.      &gt; while getting far more attention from the defense than harden/Durant      If we're using this argument, then what about Luka? His three main defenders have been Kawhi (18m), PG (13m), and Batum (13m).     Kawhi's main defender? Maxi Kleber (29m) followed by Dorian Finney-Smith (20m). There's no question Luka has been facing far better defenders.      &gt; against the the pacers in the first round.      You mean the 48-win Pacers? I think there's a difference between a team that's 2 wins from 50 versus a team that's 2 wins from 40."
Mavs won the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade
"&gt; But this goes back to my earlier point I've made in other threads; you guys didn't gather enough assets during your down times and now that you're trying to win you have barely any trade assets.  I don't give a flying fuck about any points you've made anywhere else, I was responding to the comments in this thread about this series. In this series Tim Hardaway Jr. would not have moved the needle for the Knicks in any significant way. That's because the idea that we struggled shooting the ball is what you would get from reading the scoreboards. We struggled to get good shots, it's not that we were missing good looks. We needed more playmakers, not more shooters."
This makes me think of [this moment he said he doesn't sign Knicks jerseys](https://www.opencourt-basketball.com/tim-hardaway-jr-wont-give-autograph-to-fan-because-he-doesnt-like-signing-the-knicks-ones/)
20 points lmao. Reggie Jackson had 25. PG was out performed in a do or die game by Reggie Jackson and Tim Hardaway JR 😂. Dude hasn't been worth a quarter of what was given up for him. He's dogshit. Him and Lue are the only reasons this series is even close. I stand by my statement. Kawhi should move on.
He’d basically be Tim Hardaway Jr.
He's taken it to game 7 against team with two superstars and home-court advantage while having Tim Hardaway Jr as his second-best players lol...
It’s the Tim Hardaway Jr trade now
Lol imagine giving away two firsts for Knicks Tim fucking Hardaway Jr
&gt;it’s the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade from now on  Yeah people have been making that joke all season long. Get with the program dude.
"Good players elevate in the playoffs.  Tim Hardaway Jr. averaged 16.6 PPG in reg season, 18.0 in playoffs.  K.P. was supposed to be part of a dynamic duo with Doncic.  His numbers per 36 minutes are ugly.  Boban blows him out of the water."
Not that Dennis Smith Jr did much for us either.   It was really the Tim Hardaway Jr for Derrick Rose trade. Win-win :)
"Conversely, Tim Hardaway Jr has had 4 20 point games in this series, winning all of them save Game 6."
Dude forced his way out of New York and ruined all the goodwill he had in the city just to be worse than Tim Hardaway Jr. on a different team
"Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Paul George, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Reggie Jackson."
"KoC summed it up perfectly.  &gt;[The Mavs pay Kristaps Porzingis $30M to be more than a tall wing who shoots 3s yet that's all he is now. Averaging 12.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists vs. Clippers. KP can't create his own shot and he's average at best on defense. It's The Tim Hardaway Jr. Trade from now on.](https://twitter.com/KevinOConnorNBA/status/1401023035608608771)"
"The Sunday Afternoon Delight: Afternoon of Determination  The swift Los Angeles Clippers have cut through the Pacific seas look to attempt the impossible: make it rain in LA. The Dallas Mavericks have been sturdy and agile, looking eagerly to get their Hollywood Star and advance to the second round.  Kawhi Leonard. Luka Doncic.  Paul George Tim Hardaway Jr  Three pointers! Circus shots, clean dimes. Big time players making big time plays.  A thunderous battle for glory.  Don't miss it."
Man Porzingis was better this game in defense but that man is giving Luka absolutely NO HELP. Is he serious with 7 points? averaging 13 PPG in the series is horrible man im sorry Tim Hardaway JR tried his absolute best out there and was the mavs best player
LeBron didn’t even have a teammate is good as Tim Hardaway Jr in those years
these kinda games make me wish we never traded away tim hardaway jr lol
Funny thing is that Tim hardaway jr probably gonna double or triple his dads earnings
"Does anyone else think Tim Hardaway Jr might have a similar career path to Kris Middleton? Both in trades they weren’t centred around. Both can be streaky from 3, but there also 2 guards who shot create. They can both single handle win you a game and they can also take you out of one"
"Kawhi is a glamethrower, and Tim Hardaway Jr been on a roll as well. Quiet games from Luka and PG. Extremely good close game of runs though for both teams."
damn its gonna be called the tim hardaway jr trade from now on isnt it
It might not be today. It might not be tomorrow. But Tim Hardaway Jr. WILL fuck your wife some day.
atlanta hawks legend tim hardaway jr.
Tim Hardaway Jr is a menace!
"Never realized it but Tim Hardaway Jr looks like Lebron, except with hair."
Is Tim Hardaway Jr the best Tim Hardaway?
Years from now they’re gonna refer to the 2019 trade between the Mavs and Knicks as the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade.
Tim Hardaway Sr. has changed his name to Tim Hardaway Jr.
TIM '' DAME LILLARD '' HARDAWAY JR
From henceforth we shall refer to the Knick-Mavs trade as the Tim Hardaway Jr Trade with Tingus Pingus being included as salary fodder
TIM HARDAWAY JR IS CRACKED MANS TOO OP PLS NERF
TIM HARDAWAY JR IS SO FUCKIN GOOD

What's the worst that could happen? Tim Hardaway Jr?
"Westbrook, PG, and Jaylen all seem more like 1B than 2 to me, but you could for sure make the argument. The Sixers are in more of a clear #1 and then 2A/2B between Tobias and Simmons for me (on offense, anyway), and Kristaps is *supposed* to be Luka's #2 but he barely outscored Tim Hardaway Jr this year."

"Tim Hardaway Jr. is another son of an NBA player and he seems similar. He’s obviously not a superstar so it’s a bit different, but it seems like sons of NBA players are really good at being professionals. I’m sure it helps seeing your dad go through it and getting to learn from all his successes and mistakes"
This is the laziest fucking take. Yeah he's ranked too high but the guy AVERAGED 36/8/10 against a healthy clippers squad that almost made the finals without kawhi. Not much you can do when your next best player is Tim Hardaway Jr
"I just want Tim Hardaway Jr on this team. Is that so much to ask. The legacy of having the son of one of our finest players is a story that writes itself.  Basically, I’m just asking for you to give me a photoshop of THJ in a Heat jersey"
"I don't know, it doesn't really seem worth it. You seem to be so mad about something that reason isn't cutting it anyway. Like, Tim Hardaway Jr. ranks 14th in the threes per game. I guess the three ball isn't a big part of his game. lol"
Can you start with the attempted Tim Hardaway Jr 2019 all-star campaign
Middleton is a better version of Tim Hardaway Jr
Tim Hardaway Jr
"&gt;Along with Oubre, only Tim Hardaway Jr., Otto Porter Jr., Evan Fournier and Georges Niang check the same boxes          Please continue snoozing on Powell - all tree y'all ♥♥♥"
"Honest to god I’m hype for y’all . Bucks have been my second favorite team since 2018 through Giannis. Bc of that ive come to love Brogdon (wish he would have stayed), Pat, Brook (splash mountain season was INSANE), Khash Money, and of course I’ve already had respect for Bud for coaching the hawks.   What won me over was Giannis making Tim Hardaway Jr. his son by jumping clear over him to dunk lmao. Anyways it sucks the Hawks lost but I’m glad it was to y’all and not Philly, New York, or Brooklyn."
Porzingis and tim Hardaway jr to the mavs
How you not gonna have Tim Hardaway Jr. Have yall seen his beard?  The competition should be between Oubre and THJ thats it.
"The problem is, can they keep up with the fast pace of NBA games. Luka has the strength, so he doesn't need a lot of speed, but if you're just a Tim Hardaway Jr. kind of guard, you need to be quick to get to your spot and shoot."
"Where is Tim Hardaway Jr., I’ve never seen Tim let Luka celebrate without him"
THT is Talen Horton Tucker THJ is Tim Hardaway JR
"**2014 select team**  * Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors * Trey Burke, Utah Jazz * Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls * Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors * Tim Hardaway Jr., New York Knicks * Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic * Doug McDermott, Chicago Bulls * Victor Oladipo, Orlando Magic * Mason Plumlee, Brooklyn Nets * Miles Plumlee, Phoenix Suns * Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics * Dion Waiters, Cleveland Cavaliers * Cody Zeller, Charlotte Hornets  where?"
"The Mavs honestly might want him, especially if Tim Hardaway Jr. walks. Reggie would instantly be the 2nd best playmaker on the team."
Tim Hardaway Jr
"because its stupid af, hes arguably the best 21 year old since lebron doing it with his best help being tingus pingus and Tim Hardaway Jr"
"From chasing Giannis to chasing Tim Hardaway Jr.  Not great for Miami tbh. They took a huge gamble by clearing their books for this offseason and they're just not in a position to make much out of it.  Partly Bam extending early, partly covid killing the cap, partly Miami regressing back to their average."
please explain to me who on the Mavs roster you would want to trade for not named Tim Hardaway Jr of Luka
Luka’s most reliable Robin is Tim Hardaway Jr. or Dorian Finney Smith and Jalen Brunson as Alfred.
Tim Hardaway Jr.
He's Tim Hardaway Jr on steroids.
"My favorite, Tim Hardaway Jr gets an And 1  ""And Tim gets 3...the Hardaway"""
"Vince vs. T-Mac?  No idea on this one, but I thought it would be fun to poll this thread: Tim Hardaway Sr. vs. Tim Hardaway Jr."
Dunk over Tim Hardaway jr.
&gt; Compare this roster to the Mavericks. Tim Hardaway Jr is pretty soundly the 3rd best player between the two teams. You can’t convince me Porziginis isn’t at least comparable (and probably better) to Capela despite his bad series.  Does John Collins simply not exist or something?
"Yeah when he jumped clear over Tim Hardaway Jr. I thought that was boring af. Like he's only 6' 6""? Big deal? /s"
And don’t forget Tim Hardaway Jr was also a part of that trade and a big part of any success they had this year.
It wasn't an awful trade. The consensus at the time was that it was a steal.  Mavs still came out of that trade with Tim Hardaway Jr and a still tradeable asset in Porzingis and all it really cost them was a future first. Porzingis has been disappointing for them but the trade wasn't awful.
"No, I'm saying that the best players make the team around them better, Luka can't do that. And acting like Tim Hardaway Jr, Porzings, Jason Richardson, etc have always been shit is just ignorant. Guaranteed those players do better under Trae"
"We can give Trae merit, but why do we also need to take it away from Luka? Luka's 2nd best teammate was like Tim Hardaway Jr vs the Clippers who had a top 3 player in the NBA put up a legendary performance."
"The Mavs healthy big three is Luka, Dorian Finney Smith, and Tim Hardaway Jr. oof."
My favorite player is KD atm. And Luka’s Robin is Tim Hardaway Jr.   Let that sink in.
"Come on, you can't be serious, it's amazing Luka even gets 10 assists every night. Just think about it, his scoring options are Dorian finney-smith, Tim hardaway, Jr., Josh Richardson, boban and kristaps, all whom forgets how to shoot a ball every other night. Meanwhile, Trae has Bogdan, Danilo, John Collins, Kevin huerter and Clint capela. Can't compare the two, man."
"I'm assuming you're a Mavs fan, so:   Offseason focus  An alignment between the front office and new head coach  The blank check approach with Luka Doncic: eligible for $200M rookie extension  Finding help for Doncic: projected $20-$35M in cap space but at the cost of Tim Hardaway Jr. and possibly Josh Richardson  The extension options for Jalen Brunson  Year 3 of Kristaps Porzingis ($90M+ left on his contract)  Draft assets  Future: The Mavericks owe New York a top-10 protected first in 2023, 2024 or 2025. The earliest that Dallas can trade a first is two years after the pick to New York is conveyed.  Cash: $4.5 million (to send) | $5.6 million (to receive)  Cap space breakdown  With Doncic in the last year of this rookie-scale contract, the 2021 offseason presents an opportunity for Dallas to maximize cap flexibility. By releasing the cap holds of free agents James Johnson and Hardaway, Dallas projects to have $20 million in cap space. If Richardson opts out of his $11.6 million contract and the $4.1 million team option of Willie Cauley-Stein is not exercised, the Mavericks could have up to $33.5 million. Richardson has until Aug. 1 to make a decision on whether to pick up his deal, and the Mavericks face the same Aug. 1 deadline on Cauley-Stein's team option. Additionally, the $1.8 million contract of Brunson becomes guaranteed if he is not waived by Aug. 2.  Because the cap in 2022-23 is projected to increase slightly ($112 million to $115 million), the Mavericks will have $22 million if they punt on free agency this offseason and Doncic is extended.  Porzingis and Trey Burke both have trade bonuses written into their contract. Porzingis' 5% trade kicker would get voided because it exceeds the maximum salary allowed. The Burke trade bonus is 7.5% of the value remaining on his contract (minus the player option in 2022-23).  Team needs  Shooting guard if Hardaway leaves in free agency  Wing defender off the bench  A power forward to compliment Porzingis  Extension eligible: Doncic (rookie), Brunson, Dwight Powell, Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber  Free-agent status  Richardson | Player | Bird  JJ Redick | Early Bird  Hardaway | Bird  Boban Marjanovic | Early Bird  Cauley-Stein | Team | Early Bird  Nicolo Melli | Restricted | Early Bird"
Tim Hardaway jr. too
"There's been at least one sniper taking between 20-30 every year in the draft for a long time now, pretty remarkable:  **2020:** Desmond Bane (30)  **2019:** Jordan Poole (28 - arguable)  **2018:** Grayson Allen (21), Landry Shamet (26)  **2017:** OG Anunoby (23)  **2016:** Furkan Korkmaz (26)  **2015:** Bobby Portis (22)  **2014:** Bogdan Bogdanovic (27)  **2013:** Tim Hardaway Jr (24), Reggie Bullock (25)  **2012:** Evan Fournier (20)  **2011:** Nikola Mirotic (23)  **2010:** Off year - maybe Greivis Vasquez (28)?  **2009:** Darren Collison (21), Omri Casspi (23), Wayne Ellington (28).  **2008:** Ryan Anderson (21)  **2007:** Jared Dudley (22), Aaron Brooks (26), Arron Afflalo (27)."
So what we’ve learned is that basically nobody in the Mavs org or locker room likes each other and they were all constantly going at it. Next thing you know we’re gonna hear Champ and Tim Hardaway Jr. really hate each other.

"Haha, but you have watched Luka play, right?   “I’m not saying Young or Ayton are better but it’s definitely interesting to see their teams have success…”  Come on bro, it’s not that interesting.  Ayton is the third best player on a stacked roster. Booker is a king in waiting and CP3 is CP3.   Luka is throwing lobs to Maxi Kleber and Dorian Finney Smith.  Trae is throwing them to John Collins and Clint Capela.  When shit breaks down Luka might have KP to rely on, or he might be hurt. In that case, Tim Hardaway Jr is their next best threat.  The Hawks have Bogdan Bogdan, K’von Huerter and Danilo Gallinari to score the ball if Trae is cold.  I know that no one was big on Atlanta this year, but I thought the roster upgrades were that of a playoff team, and they are clearly a much, much better team than was expected. They are a much better team than the Dallas Mavericks.  Luka might have a bad attitude in some respects, but I don’t recall Michael Jordan being a joy to interact with.  Luka Doncic is one of the best three or four players in the league already. He gets to the basket so easily, he’s so big and strong. He’s an incredible passer, a clutch shooter, and a great competitor.  If the draft happened again, TODAY, Luka Doncic is the unanimous number one pick. Tell me I’m wrong."
Let’s be honest. It’s gonna be Tim Hardaway Jr for a third run with the team
"Okay but Kristaps was garbage and Powell and Kleber were both pretty mediocre, the only Mavs starter besides Luka who has an argument that’s he’s better than a single Hawks starter based on these playoffs is Tim Hardaway Jr. and I guess maybe Finney Smith"
Tim Hardaway Jr.
Trade him for Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr.   Someone will believe they can untap his talent.
"He guarded tim hardaway for 88.3 possessions as his primary assignment, limited him to 28% FG. Other than Reggie Jackson, Tim hardaway Jr. Shot over 50% against all other defenders (including Kawhi).    Acting like Tim Hardaway wasn't the second best player on the Mavs in the playoffs."
Ur kidding right? Tim Hardaway Jr dad is Tim Hardaway Sr not Penny.
"Hey, I have a site where I make In-Depth NBA Player Profiles.

Tim Hardaway Jr said in the Bubble that they call him “The Don”
the short Tim Hardaway Jr.
"That’s real. Props for being upbeat about it. I just don’t like Austin rivers. He’s too much on his own dick for how medium he is. I think he thinks he’s better than he is.  But I do hope y’all make changes. Carlisle is a free agent coach, would you want him in Portland? Are there any coaches you have an eye on? Would you like a Becky hammond? What moves would you like to see Portland make? It seemed like nurkic is out, and I think he’s too volatile. He quit on y’all with that last foul and that really soured me on him cuz I really liked him as a player. I thought he was a poor mans jokic without shooting and with defense. Some of the passes he made were amazing. Trade CJ as well? Nurkic and CJ for Tim hardaway jr and porzingis?"
You mean the Tim Hardaway Jr trade?
"Rick is great but he’s old school, he wants shit his way and the players better listen up. Rondo got traded there and quit on the team because he doesn’t like head coaches being so controlling with him.  Carlisle can be tough, there are players that just don’t work with him (like Pop) but the ones who do, he can bring the best out of them. Like Dorian Finney-Smith or Tim Hardaway Jr. I think Giannis would really jive with him."
"Even if they wanted to rebuild, I don't think they could do it. They suck now, but Luka's way too good to tank anything. Luka's a walking playoff appearance even if his second best player is...ugh I don't even know...Tim Hardaway Jr? That makes rebuilding rough."
"Cool. Contracts aside... would you swap Tim Hardaway, Jr for Lou Williams? And have you seen Gallo try to create a shot with less than 5 seconds on the clock? It's like he's dribbling a neutron star. Bogi certainly makes timely shots, but is mostly dependent on good ball movement for those opportunities. Kevin Huerter has definitely been improving in this area, so I'll concede at the very least his  burgeoning status as a playmaker. But... come on... are any non-Hawks fans salivating over Kev and his 11.9 per?   THAT is what I am smoking. Wanna hit?"
"Maybe? But Rick has done a great job of getting the most out of players. Luka has been amazing, Tim Hardaway Jr. has been significantly better than he was in NY, undrafted players like Finney-Smith and Kleber have become solid role players.   This roster just isn’t good enough besides Luka, I don’t think there’s untapped potential like there was with Steph, Klay, and Draymond"
tim hardaway jr
"Where did I say he’s had more assists than trae? Just said they’re comparable numbers wise   9 apg vs Lukas 8, not exactly a mountain between them there   Why is the size argument dumb? That’s a large reason as to why Lukas so dominant, you can’t double him because he can see over the defense and make the right pass, not really his fault that Tim hardaway jr was the only other player on his team that managed to shoot at a decent clip in their series"
I don't get how someone could think Luka is a guard but not a PG. His backcourt mate is Tim Hardaway Jr who is a pure SG.
Tim Hardaway Jr since 2017   Steph Curry since 2015
"I wish we could trade out Tim Hardaway Jr. for a starter quality PF.   I like THJ, but Dorian Finney-Smith, THJ, and Bullock all seem to play similar roles, with Bullock probably a middle point between THJ's better offense and DFS's defense."
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
But they got Tim Hardaway Jr who has balled out for the Mavericks and is a lot more aggressive than Barnes.
u mean the tim hardaway jr trade?
Tim Hardaway Jr vs Dion Waiters in the rising stars challenge was the first time I laughed out loud while watching players duel. Unreal shot making.    https://youtu.be/31t8_KsKBw0
Three first round picks is something. Tim hardaway Jr. Is very good and pretty underrated. Not totally unrealistic were Simmons to demand a trade.
"Turner was in his 4th season. MCW was drafted in 2013 and Evan Turner was drafted in 2010.  It wasn't the strongest rookie class though. Oladipo, Giannis, Gobert, Porter Jr, CJ McCollum, Dennis Schröder, KCP, and Tim Hardaway Jr are the most well known players from the class."
Then Tim Hardaway Jr must be as weird for you as it is for me. Or hearing Glenn Robinson III.
"Tim Hardaway Jr, too. The first PS1 game I ever had was NBA Live 98, featuring his dad on the cover. You could do 360 dunks from the free-throw line, and there was a video highlight reel with cheerleaders for a half-time show. Shit was lit."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There’s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents’ shooting data than what we’ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"Starters: Jamal Murray (7) (WHAT A STEAL), Tim Hardaway Jr (14), Kyle Anderson (11) , Giannis (40), Nikola Jokic (39)  Bench: Justin Holiday (4) (Absolute Bargain), Grayson Allen (4), Naz Reid (3).  This team should be good enough to win a title. I really like Giannis and Jokic as a pairing as well.Jokic as a pairing as well."
&gt;But Griffin did a lot to clear space for Lowry  i mean we cleared space because adams/bledsoe are bad basketball players as well. lol.   we wanted free agents but we also were interested in like Reggie Jackson and Tim Hardaway Jr. too. Not just Lowry.
I have a feeling Jason Kidd will make Tim Hardaway Jr suck.
Last part is not true.  8% is the max.  You can have a range between -8% to 8% depending on your bird rights.  Like Tim Hardaway Jr.'s deal actually declines making it easier for the Mavs to sign players down the line.  The Bull's Vucevic (when he signed with the Magic) has a flat 25M a year deal over the life of the contract.
"For those unable to access the article:  Free agency was fast and predictable outside of one big point guard exchange for the Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls mortgaging chunks of the future to build something now, and the annual facelift for the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron James.  Let's take stock!  Winner: the Brooklyn Nets  The Lakers made splashier moves -- discussed in depth on the Lowe Post podcast -- but the Nets, pending good health, enter next season as undisputed favorites.  Losing Jeff Green's versatility hurt, but the Nets recovered well. Blake Griffin is a nice fit on both ends. They retained Bruce Brown on the one-year qualifying offer -- a potential win for both player and team, but more likely team -- and nabbed a bigger, meaner version of Brown in James Johnson.   They can use Johnson just as they do Brown: as the screen-setter and nominal ""center"" in super-spacing lineups. Johnson doesn't have Brown's pogo-stick floater, but he has more experience in that role -- and he's a better playmaker, though prone to wildness. Johnson meshes with Brooklyn's switch-everything scheme on defense.  Then came Patty Mills, slipping into Green's salary slot. Mills is a beloved veteran. He can play next to Brooklyn's stars as a turbo-charged roving sharpshooter (seriously, Mills scampers like he has a battery pack attached to him), and assume backup point guard duties. (That need may never arise -- James Harden runs second units -- but Mills gives head coach Steve Nash leeway to experiment, and cover for any injury to Harden or Kyrie Irving.)  The capper: retaining Kevin Durant on an extension.  The Nets are never going to be a great defensive team, and maybe not even a good one. But over 12 playoff games, they flashed a good-enough gear.  The Lakers' defense is going to slip a little. Los Angeles faces real questions about how its three stars complement one another on offense, though the Lakers will solve a lot of those questions by go time. The Nets face no such questions. The ""only one ball!"" pearl-clutching was always overblown given the collective shooting and playmaking of Durant, Irving, and Harden.  Durant has staked an emphatic claim as James' true equal. You can't assume the Lakers have an advantage at the No. 1 spot anymore.  If every team is healthy, the 2022 title is Brooklyn's to lose.   A scary thought: The Nets' Big Three has played just a shade more than 13 games together and they still nearly upended the Bucks. A scarier thought: A healthy KD, James Harden and Kyrie Irving -- with the additions of James Johnson and Patty Mills. Photo by Elsa/Getty Images Winner: the always all-in Miami Heat  Covered here. Miami enters next season third in the East pecking order behind Brooklyn and the champion Milwaukee Bucks, but it should be the kind of No. 3 that is one break away from a real chance at the Finals.  Winner: the delicious uncertainty of stasis  Most teams that stood pat -- re-signing their own guys, tinkering around the fringes -- should not feel bad. Many had no other options and got better anyway.  * The Lakers are probably on-paper favorites in the West after trading a third of their rotation for Russell Westbrook and ditching all but four players from last year's team. That said, I don't sense rivals regard them as any more or less fearsome than last season's iteration -- a shoulder-shrugging that strikes me as the correct reaction.  That's no slight. It feels like eons ago, but the Lakers were considered favorites in the West in most corners before James' ankle injury. James was neck-and-neck with Nikola Jokic for MVP.  It will take time and tinkering for the Lakers' to work out their spacing. Their reconfigured team may test Anthony Davis' taste for heavy minutes at center. The Lakers did well finding shooters on the cheap, including two younger guys in Malik Monk and Kendrick Nunn who can act as secondary ball handlers. (Nunn can share backup point guard duties with Talen Horton-Tucker.) But most of those guys are defensive liabilities -- chipping away at the Lakers' core strength.  Trevor Ariza is an exception, but he's 36 with tons of mileage and an uneven stroke. Horton-Tucker has the tools to be a plus defender, but he's 20.  It's also fair to wonder if injury risk is now baked into the LeBron experience -- if the once indestructible superman is more vulnerable. James is almost 37. He'll pass Karl Malone for No. 2 all-time in minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) this season. Injuries have derailed two of his past three seasons.  He's still LeBron. He takes care of his body. A lot of GMs and coaches -- maybe most, maybe half or a smidgen lower considering Durant's last calendar year -- would draft him No. 1 for a winner-take-all game. But it might be time to apply the ""if healthy"" qualifier here, too.   Though there are legitimate questions about how Russell Westbrook fits into this new trio in Los Angeles, the Lakers have two things going: 1) They did well to find shooters on the cheap; and 2) LeBron is still ... LeBron. Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images Meanwhile:  * The Suns filled their only hole by signing JaVale McGee, and should expect normal age-related improvement from Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Cameron Johnson. Jalen Smith has looked good in summer league. Landry Shamet brings needed quick shooting.  * The Clippers and Nuggets won't contend until Kawhi Leonard and Jamal Murray get back, but both did good business around them. The Clips retained Reggie Jackson and Nicolas Batum, took a flier on Justise Winslow, and were aggressive trading up in the first round and into the second.  * Denver retained Will Barton and JaMychal Green, and swiped Jeff Green. (That they failed to sign Javonte Green and corner the market on J. Greens is disappointing.) Zeke Nnaji is ready for more. Bones Hyland is another well-regarded late first-rounder.  * Utah didn't lose ground toggling from the Georges Niang/Derrick Favors bench tandem to Rudy Gay/Hassan Whiteside -- and snagged the potential steal of the draft in Jared Butler. We might even see Gay (and Eric Paschall) play some small-ball center. The Jazz remain way over the luxury tax, but as of now do not plan to dump any of their mid-salaried rotation guys -- Joe Ingles, Bojan Bogdanovic, Royce O'Neale -- for tax relief, sources said.  Failing to reach Game 7 against a Clippers team missing Leonard was an undeniable disappointment, but how does that series unfold if Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley are healthy?   If the Mavs are to raise their ceiling -- they've endured first-round losses in six straight playoff appearances -- they'll need the gap between their best player, Luka Doncic, and their second-best player, Kristaps Porzingis, to shrink -- considerably. AP Photo/Ashley Landis * Dallas fans are tired of the Mavericks doing pretty well in free agency after teasing grand plans. I get that. We don't need to recite the free agents who spurned the Mavericks, or the draft assets Dallas forfeited to crack open cap space.  Unwinding the Josh Richardson trade was painful -- an admission of its failure, and of wanderlust for Seth Curry. I liked that trade at the time for both teams. Richardson represented the two-way wing to shore up Dallas' defense and maybe provide secondary creation around the overburdened Luka Doncic.  Reggie Bullock is an archetypal 3-and-D wing with a quick release. (Richardson's slow release was an under-discussed problem.) Bullock brings zero off-the-bounce juice, but he's fine on a 3-year, $30 million deal.  The Mavs brought back Tim Hardaway Jr. on what should be a tradable contract. He has grown into a knockdown shooter who can pump-and-go, and run some pick-and-roll. He's not a good defender, but he tries and has improved.  I've been beating the Sterling Brown drum for years. He's 6-5, can guard three positions, and hit 42% from deep last season. That will likely prove a fluke; Brown was a league-average 3-point shooter before busting out in Houston. He's not as reliable on defense as you might think given his size and versatility, but he has the outlines of a rotation reserve on a good team.  None of this is as exciting as an alternate reality with Kyle Lowry next to Doncic.  Chasing Lowry evinced an internal belief that the Mavs were one player away from title contention. That was an appropriate mindset. Doncic is that good already.  Surrounding Doncic with shooters is the right Plan B, even if it does not resolve the issue of Doncic wearing down late in playoff games because no one else can orchestrate. (There is hope Jalen Brunson becomes that relief orchestrator, but his size is a detriment against elite postseason defenses.) The Mavs are loaded with good role players on value contracts -- grist for trades, even if the Mavs (pending a Kristaps Porzingis revival) don't have the blue-chip players to get in on superstar trades.  Dallas still has semi-reasonable pathways to Goran Dragic, though they are surely wary of surrendering more picks after forking over two in the Porzingis deal.  And that's what everything boils down to: The Mavs have a hard ceiling as long as the gap between their best and second-best players is gargantuan. Porzingis can shrink that gap by finding his groove again on defense, and playing more center. The Mavs can shrink it by trading Porzingis for someone better, but they won't manage that unless Porzingis rounds back into form.  The Mavs made their bed by punting on the first round of the draft for years (they have done well in the second, and excelled with undrafted free agents) and then dealing their remaining equity for Porzingis. They have reprioritized the draft over the past two offseasons, though the results are TBD.  The Mavs are in a bit of a holding pattern around Doncic. But they will be a dangerous playoff team, and they are doing well on the fringes while in that holding pattern. That is the only way to break out of it."
Tim hardaway jr? Want u smokin man...lmao
"I don't see it. There's no one in his tier of players who has ever been paid more. Even when their team is up against the cap. Only 5 players got paid more this offseason, CP3, Lowry, Derozan, Conley, and John Collins. Him and his agent are incredibly mistaken if he thinks he's in that tier of players. Jarret Allen, Tim Hardaway Jr, Duncan Robinson, all got paid less and are probably more sought after than schroder. The clippers have their back against the cap wall and gave big contract extensions to Morris and Kennard last year and those are both ~15/year compared to Schroder's 21/year. There's just no comparison in the league."
I like Tim Hardaway Jr.
"If I were a Mavs fan, I wouldn't chill out after the only highlights of this offseason was acquiring Moses Brown via trade and re-signing Tim Hardaway Jr."
"I mean, it took Kawhi pulling off one of the most incredible single game playoff performances in game 6 for the Clippers to beat the Mavs this year. If he doesn't go down, there's a very good chance the Clippers end up winning the West. I know we blew a 3-2 lead and guys missed shots down the stretch, but I don't think that turns the guys around Luka into a bunch of bums.   We had the #4 and #5 players in 6th man of the year voting. Our offense's most effective play all season was Luka and KP pick and pop/roll, so much so that the Clippers decided that having Zubac guard Luka was preferable to letting the Mavs run it. We have really good 3&amp;D players in DFS and Kleber. There's a lot of talent around Luka.  What they're really missing is a starting caliber secondary shot creator. Someone who can run the offense with and without Luka on the court and create shots for himself + others. Tim Hardaway Jr could create shots for himself and is a solid ball handler, but I think it's hard to rely on him to be that guy. I think the closest we have is Brunson, but he definitely needs to continue developing before he is.   I don't know where this ""Mavs are trash outside of Luka"" narrative started up but it's becoming ridiculous."
Not remotely true. Mo Williams and Zydrunas Ilgauskas were both contributors who did more with LeBron than Tim Hardaway Jr has with Luka. Don’t let recency bias fool you.
"&gt; Melo jerseys  i gotta admit, i'm way too bothered by this than it should  it's like calling tim hardaway jr ""timmy""  might as well start referring to mark jackson as mj"
I forgot Tim Hardaway Jr was white
"The best part about this is the bucks made merchandise with the dunk, Giannis saw it and made them stop selling it:  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/giannis-antetokounmpo-milwaukee-bucks-stop-selling-tim-hardaway-jr-dunk-shirt/"
"Tim Hardaway Jr known for his elite rim protection, height, and blocking abilities..  Runner up Shawn Bradley over cardboard cut out of Muggsy.."
"Okay, bet. Find me a better dunk over Tim Hardaway Jr.   I'll wait."
*easily* the greatest dunk of all time against Tim Hardaway Jr. I can't even think of what dunk against Tim Hardaway Jr would be in second.
Barkley over Giannis? Giannis jumped over Tim Hardaway Jr with Joe Biden in attendance.
Is Tim Hardaway Jr considered a roleplayer?
Pop is fine at his age. He also had a solid set of assistants there too.   But the picking of players especially with Colangelo is questionable at best. The team needed more shooters. A Seth Curry/Tim Hardaway Jr might fit well for a team that could use shooters.
"&gt; How about not talking shit when you can't even win a first round series  You must be very proud of getting pushed to 7 games, by Luka and....Tim hardaway Jr? Luka cooks you every single time he's on the court. He cooked Pat Bev so badly, he didn't see the floor anymore."
"Ah yes the Clippers who have Kawhi, Paul George and numerous talented players get pushed to 7 by Luka and... Tim Hardaway Jr? Yeah they truly own us. Clippers just lucky Kawhi choose your sad franchise, because Lebron was already on the Lakers.  Oh and if you gonna say we already beat you in 6, sure. Luka and Trey Burke are tough to beat in less than 6."
"I don’t want to trade Tim Hardaway Jr,but idk if I we’re the GM I’d probably ask the Lakers if they wanted to do a swap with LeBron"
"If Luka wins gold against USA with Slovenia, might as well replace the entire Mavs roster with the Slovenia roster if they can beat 8 all stars or however many it is. They can keep Tim Hardaway Jr tho as Luka’s hype man"
"But it's not just superstars though. Look at Tim Hardaway Jr. We offered him 4/$88m, he re-signed with the Mavs for 4/$72m. THJ is above average for sure, but he's never been an All-Star. And sure, you can say hometown discount, but a $16 million dollar discount?! I think that says just as much about what he thinks of us, if not more.   If we want to win, we need to change that shit. Not double down on it."
My bad I meant Tim Hardaway Jr.
You guys litterally offered more money to Tim Hardaway Jr a 29 yr old 3&amp;D guy
"They were apparently being offered less at the deadline though.   Easy to criticise when you don't have all the info.   What we've added isn't incredible by any means but clearly new Orleans is fighting an uphill battle in free agency, as witnessed in the attempted Tim Hardaway Jr signing."
Tim hardaway shooting way better from the field n making 500k more n he’s  less one dimensional . Don’t @ me   Trent jr is SLIGHTLY overpaid .. but we shall see if it pans out won’t we   39% fg percentage 2 guard lmao
Giannis and Tim Hardaway Jr.
Tim Hardaway jr left 14 million on the table from the Pelicans to stay in Dallas with Luka he got offered 4 for 88 and signed for 4 for 74
The Pels just got turned down by Tim Hardaway Jr despite offering $4M more per year than than Dallas.  They need to overpay for players.
Thank fucking god he didn’t accept that my head would’ve exploded if we paid Tim Hardaway Jr $22 million a year.

Yet guys r/nba thinks are worse like Fournier and Tim Hardaway Jr will both get way more than either of those guys at the end.   Even Dinwiddie off an injury will get paid more.  Teams will sign and trade for you if you are of value.
"&gt;Examples of what I'm looking for is stuff like how Tim Hardaway Jr. went from a 34.3% career 3-point shooter to shooting 40% and 39% his last 2 seasons with Luka in DAL.  In his two seasons with the Mavs, Hardaway [shot](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2020-21,2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612742&amp;PlayerId=1629029) 39.9 with Doncic on the floor and 39.3% with Doncic on the bench."
He got a little better but mostly his role changed. Still a frustrating player to watch IMO. my overall point is that everyone writes off players sometimes (people shit on the julius randle contract the knicks gave out too) but fit and role can really change things for a player rather quickly. You had people on here calling the Knicks/Mavs trade the Tim Hardaway Jr trade this season haha.
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
Duncan Robinson seems like an overpay for a bench guy  and Tim Hardaway Jr
"really?  I think it is quite good for his level of production  he's more productive than tim hardaway jr who just got signed for about the same amount of money but this one is more team-friendly with a 4th year team option  don't know why boston didn't re-sign him since a deal like this can be packaged as part of a big deal for a superstar.   nets only had to give up caris levert and jarrett allen + picks and they got harden.  even if he just stays at the level he's been at the last few years this is a very moveable contract that makes it less likely we would have to include RJ barrett as part of a big package for a superstar  I see boston fans didn't like his defense but hey thibs seems to get the best out of everyone on that end so I'm not really sweating it, our guys played great defense last year and almost all of them are coming back"
"He will not make 20m/yr below is reasoning  Here's 5 relatively similar free agent's deals today:  Tim Hardaway Jr 4/74m - better then Oubre and proven fit w/ DAL, older  Gary Trent Jr 3/54M - Trent is better, younger, and more potential  Will Barton 2/35M - ~even, but older then Oubre and injury prone, also specifically fits really well with DEN when healthy.  Alex Caruso 4/37M - Oubre is better and younger (Caruso 28 wow)  Alec Burks 3/30M -Oubre is better and younger  So for 25 year old inconsistent Oubre with seemingly more potential to unlock, and GSW isn't totally convinced he fits in that well...  Oubre will not be getting 20M/yr. I see the Warriors low balling with the full MLE (~9M) (he'd likely do a 1/1+1 deal to prove himself for a bigger deal), or the Spurs/Pelicans/Thunder (only teams with capspace) offering a 2/22-28M deal (12-14M/yr) or 2+1 player option."
My favorite fact whenever THJ signs a new contract.   Tim Hardaway Sr had 46 million dollars in total career earnings. His entire 13 year career. 46 million.  Jr will top 150 million when it's all said and done.  Sr was a 5 time All Star and made 5 All NBA teams. It blows my mind.
"My dark horse: Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Knicks, for the memes"
The Hawks are better. Would you trade Clint Capela for Maxi Kleber? Dorian Finney-Smith for Danilo Gallinari? Tim Hardaway Jr. for Bogdan Bogdanovich?
"I don't think he has that much of a market. Dallas makes some sense. They need someone to carry bench units and a bit of secondary creation. That's presuming they don't bring back Tim Hardaway JR in the 17-20 million range. Knicks also could be interested to stay relevant on a short-term deal, although they would be better served taking their lumps than being 1st round cannon fodder.  I have heard Detriot. But, that makes no sense to me."
"can the Heat add Tim Hardaway Jr and still keep Robinson??  Lowry, Robinson, THJ, Butler, Bam is a really nice core + Herro 6th man"
They are good imo. They could add Tim Hardaway jr too.
"Wonder if they could do a double sign and trade Schroder for Tim Hardaway Jr   I think once free agency opens and Lonzo and Conley sign Schroder will have to accept his fate and take 15-20m instead of 25-30M like he was hoping for   At that point Lakers can make a deal  The guard market is pretty light this year besides Lowry, Conley and Lonzo the only other real point guard free agent is Derrick Rose"
Dirk played with Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway Jr.
prolly need space for Tim Hardaway Jr.
Tim Hardaway JR special for you.
"The market dictates what players will ask.  2020-21 Salaries for these wings/shooters:  * Tim Hardaway Jr. - $18,975,000	 * Gary Harris - $19,160,714 * Malcolm Brogdon - $20,700,000 * Buddy Hield - $24,431,818 * Otto Porter - $28,489,239 * Harrison Barnes - $22,215,909 * Danilo Gallinari - $19,500,000 * Bogdan Bogdanović - $18,000,000  Can you blame his agent?"
"Yeah, but the 20-21 season was Lowry's worst in about a decade. Don't really want to trade your 2nd best player for a ~$30m/year aging star if he's on the decline.   I became fan of Lowry during the 2019 playoff run, but idk if I'd like him on the Mavs for what we'll probably have to pay him.  For reference    20-21 Season | P/36 | A/36 | R/36 | TS% | OWS | DWS | WS | VORP ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|--- Tim Hardaway Jr| **21.1**| 2.3 | **4.2** | 58.9% | **3.2** | **1.2** | **4.3** | 1.1 Kyle Lowry | 17.8| **7.6**(!) |1.0 | **59.3%**| 2.9 | 1.3 | 4.1|**1.3**  Hard to say how each will change next season, but the biggest advantage Lowry over THJ is playmaking, which you can see by the big difference in assists. If we get him, I guess time will tell if the price is worth it.  Also, Mavs have a pretty shit history in free agency, so I may just be jaded as fuck."
"Probably Tim Hardaway Jr, Jakob Poetl, Rodney Hood, and Mike Muscala."
"if you're trying to win a championship, you dont want Tim hardaway jr as your second best player"
Brad wants Tim Hardaway Jr.
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there’s Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don’t know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
"I’ll go counter culture. I’d rather have the pics. You can build an entire team through free agency with 40 draft picks. Stars, role players, bench warmers, the whole thing. Luka is a generational talent/prospect but he’s only one dude, and without any assets his 2 and 3 are Pingus and Tim Hardaway Jr."
Oh ok cheap like Joe Harris.  Whoops 20 million per year.  Or Bertans.  Whoops 17 million per year.  Or Tim Hardaway Jr.  Whoops 18 million per year.  No elite shooters are signing bargain basement contracts anymore.
"For some reason Pick 13 and Pick 15 have been amazing picks for various teams over the years.  Pick 13: Mitchell, Booker, Levine, Kobe, Karl Malone.   Pick 15: Giannis, Kawhi, Nash.   &amp;#x200B;  Strangely cannot say the same for the other picks from 11-16, just not on the level of 13 and 15.   Pick 11: Shai GA, Klay Thompson, Reggie Miller.   Pick 12: Steven Adams, Mookie Blaylock.  Pick 14: Michael Porter Jr, Bam Adebayo, Tim Hardaway, Clyde Drexler.   Pick 16: Ron Artest, John Stockton."
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
"Lol you just described Tim Hardaway Jr and I just checked and their stats are quite similar as well. Though by what you said, Buddy is probably a better defender."
The one on Jordan Crawford and Jeff Green is disgusting. Also you gotta love Tim Hardaway Jr just laughing after his grab wasn't enough lol.
"Porzingis trade. If he gets through his injury troubles, maybe it'll flip back.  At first, we didn't know what to think and people celebrated the cap space.  Then we struck out in free agency. Clear Dallas win because they also got Tim Hardaway Jr. Porzingis was looking like a borderline all-star, decent fit with Luka.  Then this season's injuries happened and the Mavs are stuck with what looks to be an albatross contract. Not only was Porzingis playing pretty badly, he is now disgruntled in Dallas and doesn't like playing with Luka, which means there's even more reason to get out from under his contract."
The goal seems to be THJ and Lowry  [How the mavs get THJ and Lowry](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2021/7/28/22596599/how-can-the-mavericks-sign-kyle-lowry-and-tim-hardaway-jr)
I'd rather have Tim Hardaway Jr than this version of Tatum
"DeMar has shown he can be the number 1 guy on the best regular season team. Even in the playoffs it might've been a different story if it wasn't for LeBron.  Hardaway Jr. hasn't shown anything resembling that.  I think DeMar can be a great 3rd option. He's got decent defense, better than Hardaway Jr., elite playmaking for a non PG, he's one of the elite midrange scorers and he's way better at creating his own shot.  Tim can hit some hot streaks, but that's about it."
"I hate saying its not even close but it's demar and it's not close   Derozen is a better, finisher, iso scorer, playmaker, passer, better handles, better from.mid range  Tim Hardaway Jr can shoot 3s though"
I can't believe people are holding not getting past the first round against Luka. Kinda hard to win when your second best player in the series is Tim Hardaway Jr.
I feel like it’s more likely the Lakers asked for Kristaps or Tim Hardaway Jr
Lakers should sign Tim Hardaway JR
"I lowkey disagree it was ok, Rudy Gobert, McCollum, Olidipo when he was healthy, Otto Porter had his moments then fell off, Tim Hardaway Jr, Adams, now it's definitely one of the worst drafts in 2010s but I wouldn't say it's horrible. But the top 10 was atrocious   P.S. in 3+ years we all will be calling 2018 draft top 5 all time"
Tim Hardaway Jr is going to leave Dallas and going to have a JeraminGrant year.
"That's moving the goal posts, and cherry picking stats to prove a point. In those 3 games that you mentioned, Jokic averaged 24/16/14, which is a monster statline in the elimination games. He was getting doubled plenty towards the end of the series, as can be seen from his assist numbers in these three games. This is also why Murray's numbers were higher than usual. Despite all that, for the series against the Clippers he averaged more points, rebounds or assists than Murray.   Luka not having help on his team shouldn't be used as an argument to put down other players. Tim Hardaway JR. averaged 17 on 40% from three, which is basically playoff Scotty Pippen (averaged 17.5 for the career), with improved 3pt shooting on offense. He also had a player widely regarded as being better than Jokic when they entered the league, and didn't seem to be able to get the best out of him as the primary ballhandler on the team.  The narrative with Luka seems to drift towards the James Harden Rockets narrative, where he's the only guy doing everything, and nobody else knows how to play basketball. Unlike Luka though, Harden's made some really deep playoff runs, and might have done the same this year if not for the injury, so I'm not sure that he should be ranked below Luka either."
The ultimate is that Dirk Nowtizki played with both Tim Hardaway Sr. and Tim Hardaway Jr.
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
"I mean, the article presents two points really:  \- Luka is good (I agree)  \- Dallas has cap space.  I kinda get it. Many teams have max cap space this summer, but Dallas is arguably the best of them (I think most would put them above New York and Miami).  Sadly, half of that space is JJ Redick, but another half is Tim Hardaway Jr, who is an important player. Him leaving is far from neutral. Getting some other player would involve parting with him one way or another, most likely.  Dallas can pull off some complicated move from it that will turn them into contenders - hope is mostly in the fact that some max players might want to come precisely with the priority to make them contenders. But I wouldn't yet bet on it. It's gonna be difficult."
"Dallas gains: Kawhi, Drummond, Oubre, Markkanen.  Dallas Loses: Tim Hardaway Jr.  Geeeez does that even fit in the salary cap?"
"Yeah I hear you but he carried his team averaging 35 ppg with Tim Hardaway Jr. as his streaky second best player and took the Clippers to 7 games. The Mavericks were the only team that had to face the Clippers fully healthy, and Luka and his crappy supporting cast damn near beat them."
2013 Redraft  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Rudy Gobert  3. CJ McCollum  4. Victor Oladipo  5. Steven Adams  6. Robert Covington  7. Otto Porter Jr.  8. KCP  9. Kelly Olynyk  10. Tim Hardaway Jr.
Worst coach in the league with your second best player as Tim Hardaway Jr.  Feeling pretty cocky eh?
Tim Hardaway Jr vs Tony Snell
His statue should he him jumping over tim hardaway jr but I like your idea
"Murray would never get a chance to be bubble Murray next to Luka. They basically play the same position, with Luka being a ball dominant player with a usage rate of 36%. MPJ averaged 11.4 pts in the wcf run, and basically had to be taken off the floor against the Jazz because he was targeted on D on every possession, which didn't change in last years playoffs.. I see the scenario of Murray and MPJ starting to resemble Tim Hardaway JR and KP next to Luka more likely than the dream scenario of yours where Luka takes them to promise land."
Ehh last years team relied heavily on Tim Hardaway JR.  Jalen Brunson became virtually useless in the Clippers series because he couldn’t create.  Porzingis sucked.  (He was good in 2020).  They had to play Boban last year because nobody outside of Luka could create.  But maybe you didn’t watch the series?  Having shooters mean nothing against a team like the Clippers who switch everything.  Shooters kill drop back schemes not teams who switch 1 through 5.  The Clippers could stay home and rotate and then the shooter did nothing because no one outside of Luka can attack a close out.  So yeah that’s a poorly constructed team.
"Show me the year as the first option Harden made the playoffs when his second best playoff was Tim Hardaway Jr level  Show me the year Harden with a championship caliber roster made the finals   Show me the year Harden competed in a playoff series people said he had no chance to win   Here’s what Harden does, he gets a stacked team and he takes them 1 step shorter than you expect him too   And then he quits on the team and throws a public tantrum so he can go be the 2nd option because he knows he can’t win as a 1st option  I’ll bet a house on it that Luka never looks in the mirror and says to himself “I’m not good enough to win a title as the best player on my team”"
Lmao of course you make it racial. Also Eric Gordon averaged 20 ppg that series lol. Lukas second best player was Tim hardaway jr lmao. Luka is 22 and pretty much has played as well as harden the last 2 years and is 10 years younger. It’s close but it’s not unreasonable to put him ahead of harden.
"TBF, how often does Tim Hardaway JR get mentioned at all?"
so he pulled a Tim Hardaway jr
I never see anyone talk about players growing up rich other than Steph.   Tim Hardaway made about 2.5x more than Dell Curry in his NBA career and I've never heard one person mention Tim Jr growing up wealthy.
"DAE Lebron for Tim hardaway jr, Dwight Powell and Maxi??"
KP and Frank were the new era for us. Now they play with Luka who should have been a first overall pick and is an incredible talent and Tim Hardaway Jr. If you told me the day of the draft that would be a team’s core in 2021. I would’ve assumed we got Luka.   Crazy how things change
Whens Tim Hardaway Jr retiring?
"ben had 13 assists in game 7. hardaway jr is another player to fit the seth curry role for us. sure, tim can actually shoot, but we aren't even getting to game 7 if you're taking away ben's playmaking and defence and not replacing it with at least equivalent value"

what are you talking about dude? obviously i tune in for tim hardaway jr. too many casuals around here
"Tim Hardaway was an All Star and I loved watching Glenn Robinson at Purdue.  So what I’m saying, kids, is think about this in a couple decades when you’re watching Trae Young Jr. in a shootout against Donavan Mitchell III or whatever.   That’s when you’ll *really* feel old."
"Yes luka, with a broken porzingis and glorified spotup shooter tim hardaway jr as his best teammates, should absolutely be expected to beat kawhi/pg clippers. Because lebron beat the gilbert arenas/antwan jamison Washington wizards in his 3rd year. Great logic."
"They’ve given you Tim Hardaway Jr, Frank, and that other guy who’s 5’29"
"Tim Hardaway Sr, and Tim Hardaway Jr  The Clippers, and Luka Doncic  THe Warriors, and James Harden"

Tim Hardaway Sr and Jr  Rick Barry/Brent Barry
"The dunk's wonderful, but this title's a bigger stretch that Giannis Antetokounmpo's wingspan. Could have gone with ""*one* of the greatest dunks in NBA history"" but ""possibly *the* greatest"" sets up the viewer for disappointment.   Since *the* greatest is the scale we're working with though, here's some things I see working against it, depending on what plays a role in one's judgement of greatest.   * It's a relatively inconsequential play (contrary to say, Baron Davis over AK, KJ on Hakeem, Kemp on Lister)  * Strong lack of ambiance. When you're submitting your name for all-time dunk honors, [it doesn't matter if you're on the road at an old school Clippers game](https://youtu.be/Wnz95vZn7ig?t=16), the fans generally know when they've seen an all-time nominee and respond in kind.   * Tim Hardaway Jr. made no play on the ball and may have not even realized what was happening until the dunk was nearly completed.   * Giannis is 6-foot-11 with what Google tells me is a 7-foot-3 wingspan (honestly looks longer than that but I'll defer to Google). It's a great play regardless, but there's something a bit anti-climatic about a dude that lanky bypassing a guard who didn't really contest.   * If you take Hardaway out of the equation, and you almost might as well because he wasn't contesting or even understanding what was coming up upon him, it's kind of just an excellent one-hand lob by Stretch Armstrong. I'm not sure Giannis even had to make any sort of adjustment along the way. As a result, it feels like Hardaway just happened to be there as an invisible prop as opposed to being something vanquished and conquered.  * It's a dunk that lacks a bit in personality. It looks almost routine, which is impressive in itself, but doesn't bode well when I'm considering my all-time NBA dunks.   In a vacuum, it's an awesome dunk moment. Compared to the greatest dunks in NBA history, it's not matching up."
"I'd guess it has something to do with him  jumping over an entire Tim Hardaway Jr. I don't think this is the best in game dunk, but I'd hazard a guess people might think so because of the jumping over someone bit."
What does this and Kawhi dunking on Kleber have to do with each other?  This is when Tim Hardaway Jr was in NY
We were a tanking team that never went through a rebuild and the best talent we added was Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr.   I think we were a pretty good example of trying to compete too quickly once you get a star player.
Didnt he jump over Tim Hardaway Jr a few seasons later.
"not one of the greatest, but Tim Hardaway Jr. and Jae Crowder deserve some recognition"
"The second best player on the Mavs comes off the bench for the Hawks last year. Who is better John Collins or Kristaps Porzigis. Bogdan or Tim Hardaway Jr. Josh Richardson, or Danilo Gallinari.  I said Assist% as they had virtually identical rates for the past 2 years and you know that. Its not trolling to say luka's the better playmaker, and Trae isn't top 10 its just the truth."
"Explain to me how it’s rushing a rebuild when these teams would’ve been adding a high ceiling 24 year old player who fits their timelines, has only gotten better, plays THE most position and role in the league? On top of that all these teams are in good Cap situations to the point where a contract like that wouldn’t have hurt them short term or long   Spurs, Grizzlies, and OKC are not going to rush their rebuilds with a max offer to a role-player. NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than I am not arguing with casuals...  &gt;NO and Dallas both had bigger sights than a role-player making a max.   Yes, because these teams sure did have amazing offseasons right? Both these teams missed out on every target they went after outside of Dallas retaining Tim Hardaway Jr for 72mill. If OG Anunoby had went into free agency it would’ve been no different than what happened when Jerami Grant went into free agency last year, and OG literally had a better year this season than the one Jerami did his last year in Denver on top of the fact he’s also 2 years younger. And I GUARANTEE you if any of these teams had the chance to pay grant what he’s making to have them on their team they WOULD. The same exact thing goes for OG.   &gt;I am not arguing with casuals...  So I’m a casual for having a strong opinion and defending it, but you aren’t despite the fact that you’ve done nothing but reply to me half ass comments, throw insults, and essentially have no rebuttal besides saying “no he would’ve have”???   You’re really projecting here bud."
"Y’all can have… powell, tim Hardaway JR, JJ Brunson, protected first.  Obviously not a great haul for Philly lol"
Tim hardaway jr
"Played with him in Miami. Haaa, guy didn’t miss. I had the pleasure of playing with a bunch of nba players being down there. Raja Bell, Tim Hardaway Jr, Euro league guys, etc. Joe was different. Big time scorer."
Tim Hardaway Jr.
Tim Hardaway Jr from the Mavs got like $18m he's really good but I'd say Lonzo is like $2m better
"It was never much about his stats, he a starter in the NBA for sure.   It is always about the money. He won't live up to the max deal he got. On his next contract his perception will change even more. Moving from $33M to around $20M or so. Around guys like Buddy Hield, Tim Hardaway Jr, Harrison Barnes, etc."
"Actually it was Dime.  They were always saying ""Dime to Shaq"" or ""Dime again!"" or ""Beautiful Dime pass"".  That's why nowadays they call nice assists as dimes thanks to Dime Hardaway who goes by his real name as Tim Hardaway Jr."
giannis didn’t jump over tim hardaway jr for this disrespect smh
"Why is Tim Hardaway Jr in that photo in the OP, like he's a new signing? I know he just signed an extension with the Mavs, but he's already been there for 2 1/2 seasons, and isn't a newcomer like Sterling Brown, Moses Brown, and Reggie Bullock."
"[List of 2nd generation NBA talents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second-generation_National_Basketball_Association_players)  Notables: Jerami/Jerian Grant &amp; Harvey Grant, Tim Hardaway Sr &amp; Jr, Del Curry &amp; Steph/Seth Curry, Mychal Thompson &amp; Klay Thompson, Bill Walton &amp; Luke Walton,"
Tim Hardaway Jr/Sr would be interesting.
"Stars or period? I know he's friends with Tim Hardaway Jr., I dunno who else. I'm not some Luka superfan lol."
Andrew Wiggins or Tim Hardaway Jr. Different styles but I feel they hold similar value
"It's what happens when tim hardaway jr is his 2nd best player and he's forced to play against Kawhi and PG. Give him Middleton, Jrue, Lopez over Tingus Pingus, THJ, and Josh Richardson and he beats the clippers. The Mavs are not a serious franchise when it comes to building around Luka. They're surrounding him with decent at best JAGs"
I can vouch that Tim Hardaway Jr would never be in the league if it weren’t for Tim Hardaway
"When healthy, KP is a higher-tier all-star, and yes, good enough to be the ""second star"" for a guy who repeatedly and consistently carries his team through games they have no business winning.  The issue is he's almost never healthy.  If he *is* healthy this year, for an entire season, alongside fit, post-Slovenian National Team Luka and Tim ""Tim Hardaway Sr."" Hardaway Jr., the Mavs are a contender, even against the Superteam Lakers and Healthy Clippers."
Mavs got tim hardaway jr
tim hardaway jr?
Neither of these are perfect examples for satisfying the statement “Sons of NBA stars rarely become stars themselves” but Dell Curry was like a 15 ppg guy throughout the 90’s and now we have Steph. Also there’s Tim Hardaway and TH jr. I wouldn’t call Tim Hardaway Jr a star but he’s def a valued contributor.
Or hes just super competitive and respects his opponents. John Collins almost got yammed on by Tim Hardaway JR last night and smiled and helped him up because it was such an aggressive attempt. Thats how I view Dray's behavior. No idea where you got this take from lol
Some other wild things. We traded Jrue away who more likely than not woulda stayed if we woulda been willing to offer him the bag but basically foreseeing that we had somewhat of a mutual separation. But then we go and offer Kyle Lowry more than what it woulda cost for Jrue and we don’t even get Lowry. I think everybody would say they’d rather just have Jrue than an older Lowry to go with this core anyway. A similar thing happens where we let Zo go because Griff thinks he would be overpaid but then we offered even more money to Tim Hardaway Jr who may or may not be better than Zo right now but ultimately wouldn’t really move the needle and has less upside than Zo does. AND again he doesn’t even come and stays in Dallas for 12 million less. I think both Griff and Pels fans have VASTLY overrated what we would be able to do with extra cap room down here. Nobody of real value will want to come here and even if they do we will have to overpay them anyway just to get them here. So that’s why when you already have a Jrue or a Zo on your roster you just pay them instead even if you think it might be an “overpay”. In the NBA if you’re a good player you’re gonna get big bucks 9 times outta 10. The only teams who sometimes get away with discounts are the big market teams and we’re the smallest market in the league
"Luka was challenged, especially early by OG and Barnes; but in the 2nd half he was really rolling and closed the game out great in the 3rd and 4th.  Full marks for being the best player on the court and drawing the defence in to set up Tim Hardaway Jr who buried the Raptors with his outside shooting."
"When Tim Hardaway Jr is on fire, he's on *Fire*. It felt like he was using hacks."
"I'd rather have him post up then 3 and D player fucking Dorian Finney smith. Fuck Me I can't even watch it anymore, this team was literally built for a small ball 5 out offense Pg-luka Sg-tim hardaway jr. Sf-Reggie Pf-Dfs C-tingus pingus   Yes our defense would be awful, but the offense, just please don't make me watch Dfs posting up again."
"The other day against the Mavs, Trae Young jumped backwards into Tim Hardaway Jr and Tim's chin started bleeding hard he had to get 3 stitches at the break.   Trae got the call and shot free throws smfh"
That one with Tim Hardaway Jr hurt to watch Trae get the call (But the whole game was hard to watch too)
I agree. Mavs must’ve been shocked that we said yes to taking him in the KP trade   ~~The Kristaps Porzingis Trade~~  ~~The Tim Hardaway Jr. Trade~~  ~~The Cap Space Trade~~  The Deandre Jordan Salary Dump
Vince jumping over a dude or Giannis jumping over Tim Hardaway Jr. I like dunks
it's called the Tim Hardaway jr trade now
Look at their roster  When Tim Hardaway Jr is your 2nd best player you're not doing shit
Tim Hardaway Jr tho
Do people want Luka Doncic to play off-ball just for the fuck of it? Do you really think more Porzingis post-ups and Tim Hardaway Jr. ballhandling is the key to Dallas taking the next step? Lmfao. The team as currently constructed is best with Doncic running shit.
"Kawhi did dirty to Spurs who was the role model franchise that is beloved by comish, media etc. It was forgotten immediately after the trade.  You'll trade Simmons and your reporters will publish things to steer the fan opinion. There will be a lot of write-ups describing how sending Simmons would help to focus on the game etc. Fan base will forgive Simmons trade easily.Look at KP trade from Knicks. 2-3 reports came and as the trade happened fans just poured KP-hate out.   Knicks fans said they won the trade. Today looking at that trade, the #1, #2, #3 best players from that trade are playing for Mavs now. (KP-Tim Hardaway JR-Burke). All other Knicks players are out of the league or bench warmers elsewhere."
The Tim Hardaway Jr. to Ben Simmons' Kristaps Porzingis
"Avery Bradley fits well, Tim Hardaway Jr. may fit better. My point is Klay fits the best."
"This is actually a very interesting question for the Mavs since it was a year post-championship after Cuban didn't bring Tyson Chandler back.  11-12: Jason Kidd / Vince Carter / Shawn Marion / Dirk Nowitzki / Brendan Haywood   21-22: Luka Doncic / Tim Hardaway Jr / Dorian Finney Smith / Maxi Kleber / Kristaps Porzingis   &amp;#x200B;  I think I'd take the current starting lineup over the champion defending lineup, especially since that team was dealing with the Lamar Odom issues."
"Yeah, Luka is on the level where he makes a team a contender by himself. We took 3 games off the Clippers with our second best player being Tim Hardaway Jr. As long as Luka is on the team, we will be contenders"
I’d much rather have Tim Hardaway and KP even with the huge contract over *checks notes* Dennis Smith Jr. and two late first round picks.
"Very entertaining post. Only changes I would make would be an honorable mention for pass being elbow pass from \[Jason ""White Chocolate"" Williams\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4CkbTsQDA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4CkbTsQDA))  And best dunk would go to \[Giannis ""The Greek Freak"" Antetokounmpo\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okFx2IJImuo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI4CkbTsQDA)) dunking over Tim 6'4"" Hardaway Jr."
Tim Hardaway Jr  Lonnie Walker  Dinwiddie  Both Bogdans
Tim Hardaway Jr
"Using some of our current players, it would be something along the lines of:   Luka/ Goran Dragic  Tim Hardaway Jr./ Reggie Bullock/ Danny Green  Mikal Bridges/ Dorian Finney-Smith/ PJ Tucker  Robert Covington/ Maxi Kleber  Myles Turner/ Nerlens Noel   The 2011 team had a ton of excellent defenders and vets on it, this team is still much younger than the 2011 team though lol"

"Yeah this really needs more definition. What statistic are we using to judge the best player, and over what time frame? If it's PPG in the finals, someone like Terry Rozier, Tim Hardaway Jr, etc who you can plausibly get 20ppg from as a sixth man would be a lot more valuable."
Tim hardaway jr would be a good pick for that. Dad was 5x all NBA.
&gt; Trash. LaVine better. PG better. Book better. Mitch Better. Tim Hardaway Jr better. Not even a Top 5 SG  You forgot a certain watch tapping someone.
&gt;Tim Hardaway Jr better. Not even a Top 5 SG  Come on now lol
He’s a clown.  Dude thinks the earth is flat and the vaccine will kill u  Clown would be toiling in obscurity if LeBron didn’t come back to Cleveland  Dudes an allen iverson lite without any of the likability. zero leadership. Best suited as a sidekick  Trash. LaVine better. PG better. Book better. Mitch Better. Tim Hardaway Jr better. Not even a Top 5 SG
Tim Hardaway Jr. would be Sacramento's 2nd best player.
and Tim Hardaway Jr becomes Devin Booker lol
"do you guys still have tim hardaway jr? bro the dude was an actual menace on offence during our playoff series. That dude looks, acts, and plays like a barbarian!"
You mean guys like Tim Hardaway Jr and whiever else isnt guarding Steph?
I just like how good of a teammate Tim Hardaway Jr. is.  Dude is always hyped for whatever his teammates are doing.
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"It's because he shows months-long flashes of great rim protection and mobility in the regular season. It was like a year ago when he had an amazing stretch of 30 games or so averaging 26/10/2 with over 2 blocks and a steal on 62% ts, and the defense was above average with KP on the floor all season despite a Luka, Seth Curry, Tim Hardaway Jr, Brunson backcourt rotation. His defensive numbers at the rim suggest he was a great rim protector that season.  Even last season there was a stretch from late February to early April where he looked amazing, his rim protection numbers looked elite, and the Mavs were a top 5 defense over that stretch despite a decently tough schedule. Unfortunately the defense fell apart the last few weeks of the season and the playoffs. Not saying it's much good if he isn't consistent, but as a mavs fan it's not hard to see his defensive impact completely changes the team when he's playing well.  I haven't seen anyone call him a good post up player though"
"Okay no need to be a dick because you don’t understand something.   You know who also is a more efficient scorer than Luka because he shoots 3s better than him? Tim Hardaway Jr. Is THJ a better offensive player than Luka?   My point is that because Luka is better at every other part of scoring, he’s a better overall offensive player. Again, basketball is not played on a spreadsheet."
"I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years but only have last year's list to compare. Without spending too much time, here is the best I've got for you:  \- 21 new players this year:  Incoming:  Klay Thompson (injury)   Julius Randle   LaMelo Ball (2020 rookie)   Mikal Bridges   Anthony Edwards (2020 rookie)   Collin Sexton   Dejounte Murray   Terry Rozier   Tyrese Haliburton (2020 rookie)   Jonas Valanciunas   Dillon Brooks   Cade Cunningham (2021 rookie)   Derrick Rose   Seth Curry   De'Andre Hunter   Norman Powell   Harrison Barnes   Darius Garland   RJ Barrett   Tim Hardaway Jr   Jonathan Isaac (injury)  Outgoing:  Steven Adams   Danilo Gallinari   Serge Ibaka   Al Horford   LaMarcus Aldridge   Tyler Herro   Dennis Schroder   Andre Drummond   Blake Griffin   Kevin Love   Goran Dragic   Hassan Whiteside   Ricky Rubio   Montrezl Harrell   Eric Bledsoe   Davis Bertans   Josh Richardson   Lou Williams  \- Rookies are tough because they are not always in all the lists. Obviously also difficult to rank someone when they've yet to play a game. Only Cunningham made the cut this year.  \- I usually just do 75 and up. Very rarely is anyone under 75 going to play many minutes."
"They are horrible, worst of the worse year in year out. Chris coward Cohen the Fromer owner of the team was a cancer… we traded tim hardaway for bimbo Fucking coles.  Bimbo coles. Think about all the players the franchise surrounded itself with, Bimbo Coles, adonal foyle (great dude btw just not good bball player), Todd fuller, joe smith , mike dunleavy jr, Chris porter, Jeff foster, Andris Birdrins, Ike diogu, Patrick Bryant ,   I don’t even wanna go in it’s depressing. I call those the dark ages of my fandom to gsw. So happy things are much better now :)))"
"Wasn’t James Harden, it was Tim Hardaway Jr"
"Since Tim Hardaway Jr. was already with the Mavs last season, aren't they allowed to talk to their own player through the start of free agency anyway?"
"Yeah there’s at least plausible deniability. For example, the Mavs signed Tim Hardaway jr. soon after FA started, but it’s also possible that they called him as soon as the clock hit, offered him $80 million, and he said yes. That’s probably not how things happened, but it’s still a possibility. Like you said, with S&amp;Ts tampering is basically the only possible way it happens that quickly when 3 parties are involved"
"I wish I caught some of those pro ams with Kidd, Payton, JR.  I think other guys would show up to like Tim Hardaway   The best I saw was Arenas, Lin, J Rich, Lamont Murray, I think Abdur-Rahim  The league quickly dropped off after that and hardly any pros play last 10 years in the SF Pro Am"
"Tim Hardaway Jr, pretty common abbreviation tbh iirc sns"
Ben's usage% has dropped every year of his career to the point where it's lower than role players like Tim Hardaway Jr.   He is a generational talent. I'd want out too.
Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Jaylen Brown
who tf is his 2nd guy Tim Hardaway Jr the 40% high volume shooter? or the immobile giraffe?
So is Tim Hardaway Jr or Dorian Finney-Smith our point guard? That makes no sense.
Throw in Tim hardaway jr and 4 frps and you got a deal
"Okay you coach the Mavs. Tell me what option our roster has. You want Tim Hardaway Jr to initiate the offense? You want Maxi Keleber/DFS/Powell dribbling the ball around?  When Jalen Brunson is in the game, you will see Luka go in the post more, play off ball more. Run handoffs with the bigs. Hes not a good off ball player, but he gives the ball away. But outside of Brunson, nobody can even dribble in traffic."
mavs are trash after tim hardaway jr
"I don’t think Gordon gets bought out. His contract isn’t great by any means but his yearly salary is right in-line with other bench scoring guards/wings like Fournier and Tim Hardaway Jr. He’s just as good if not better than those guys, so I think there’s a contender out there that’d be willing to trade for him."
Thing is the most glaring is the decline of Tim hardaway Jr. It's like he's been in a forever slump
"You guys are depending on Tim Hardaway Jr. to be a starter and give you serious scoring production. He's just not that type of player. At best, he's a bench guy that can come in and give you 15 points when you need it. He's also undersized defensively and not a great athlete.   I really liked Finny-Smith coming out of Florida, but his shot mechanics are still bad and he's not going to give you anything on offense. I admire his defensive effort but he's another guy that you're depending too much on.   KP just can't be your 2nd option, or even 1st option when Luka is having an off night.   Jalen Brunson is a great player but he's still undersized and depending on him to pick up scoring slack is also too much.   Powell and Cauley-Stein offer nothing offensively and aren't the hyper-athletic defensive guys that can get out and run that they used to be.   Aside from Luka and sometimes KP, nobody scares me on the perimeter for you guys.  Edit: and yes I think Kidd was a bad hire"
"I guess Tim Hardaway Jr, maybe? The Mavs seem to be rated pretty accurately (especially with KP showing what he actually was/can be), for better AND for worse."
"Good thing I’m not calling him soft for personal reasons then huh? Im just saying the way he plays basketball is soft. Im glad that a all-star 7 foot center was able to successfully do what a majority of 7 foot centers are able to. He can’t post up Danilo gallanari, James harden or tim hardaway jr but he can grab 6 rebounds hooray!!!!!   Also you won’t call people soft,  but will call people you don’t know who are spreading correct information dumbass? Seems a little backwards to me and a lot more cringe than calling a basketball player soft."
"I think we’re contenders of everyone plays to their full potential but I doubt that will happen. Players like Tim hardaway jr need to start playing well consistently, and our role players need to start hitting from 3. Also with kp playing at pf we really lack good center’s. Idk man, I still feel like we’ve got a long way to go until we’re considered contenders."
"Kristaps Porzingis yelled, “There you go!” Tim Hardaway Jr. gave a look of pleasant surprise. Doe Doe belted, “We got a fucking squad now.” And before Luka Doncic hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kawhi Leonard hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
No player is as hot and cold as Tim hardaway jr
Tim Hardaway Jr
I still can’t get over his Tim Hardaway Jr dunk.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=okFx2IJImuo  He jumped over a guy and made it look normal.
"To a point, I agree with you. I also don't want the 6ers to get fked because of Simmons' dumb ass. But if you're getting offered elite role players like Mikal Bridges, Lonzo, Herro, Tim Hardaway Jr types (obviously not just 1), then I think it might be worth consideration"
Can a combination of Tim Hardaway Jr and Dwight Powell be on that list

Tim Hardaway Jr revenge game
Agreed Barnes doesn’t have the same fast twitch athleticism and height as Giannis. Like I don’t expect him to ever accidentally jump over Tim Hardaway Jr. in a game type athleticism. But Barnes has received better coaching as a young player and therefor has a better feel for the game and projects to be a better shooter. He won’t be as quite of a physically dominating player But he has a better baseline of ball skills to build from.
What Tim Hardaway Jr. ain’t good enough for ya?

"Out of teams still in.  I think most underrated players ( looking at from an underrated importance to winning) I am going to go with guys like Monte Morris , Tim Hardaway Jr, etc.     Seems when those guys have good games and can put up around 20, they tend to win.  That third or so option is way important. Especially when the stars are resting and points have to come from other players.     When they ball out they win."
"This year's playoff has been very different. Kristaps Porzingis disappeared and could be traded during the off-season. They are calling it the Tim Hardaway Jr trade. Kuzma might get traded as well? Kuzma has struggled the entire time during his time with Lebron. I would love for Kuzma to be on a team where he can really show how good he is.  Right now he's a bum. But the Lakers will trade Drummond, Wesley Matthews, or Gasol before Kuzma."
"If only KP is in his knicks self mode and tim hardaway jr gets better, i think mavs can poise a threat"
"Can't wait for Tim Hardaway Jr to save Luka's legacy by hitting the clutchest 3 pointer of all time, the shot around the world, against **my** \[insert name of a team here\]"
"Paul George, Derrick Rose, Robert Covington, Markell Fultz, Tim Hardaway Jr., DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, TJ McConnell, Russell Westbrook, Jabari Parker, Jaylen Brown, Bryn Forbes, Julius Randle, Kelly Oubre, and many others can't name off the top of my head."
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
"You’re kidding yourself if you think this Hawks roster is “comparable” to any of the Mavs teams Luka has been on. His second best player has been KP, who is injured every year and has not played like an all star since he was on the Knicks. Their third best player is Tim Hardaway Jr. Tell me you’d take him over anyone in your rotation. Get a grip and quit dick riding."
Tim Hardaway Jr &amp; Jaylen Brown
"You know how everybody over-rates guys on their favorite team?   Yeah. That's what you're doing.   Porzingis is a negative asset at this point, and the Mavs would trade him for Capela in a heartbeat. And I'm absolutely here for the Tim Hardaway Jr resurgence, I love guys who rebuild their game later in their career, but I think you're vastly over-rating how he's seen around the league.   The best version of KP is much better than Capela, but the version we've seen post-most-recent-injury plays on the perimeter, doesn't play much defense, and stands around a lot. The argument that he's better than Capela is basically that pre-injury KP is hiding somewhere, ready to come up - but at a certain point that starts to become really optimistic.   You have like $20m in cap space this coming year, right? Or does basketball reference have a non-guaranteed contract listed as guaranteed? That's a nice chunk of change, but it's not ""A ton"" of cap space. It'll probably get you a player of approximately the quality of Kelly Oubre. (Who, by the way, would be a great fit!)"
"Not necessarily since we also got Tim Hardaway Jr.  But yes, Porzingis has not been performing to be that second star that we needed next to Luka."
"You're right, dallas should play more jalen brunson-boban marjanovic pick and rolls or tim hardaway jr. - dwigh powell handoffs. If all of that fails, they can always give the ball to porzingis for a logo 3 with 20 seconds on the shot clock."
"Tim Hardaway Jr played 45 min?!  I felt Luka kind of gassed at 4Q. He needs to improve his stamina for playoffs games, get the freethrow juju out of the way.  Mavs needs to close this series next game. I don't think Luka can carry the load to 7 games..."
Tim Hardaway Jr. is Dallas' 2nd best player.
"You just lost to Luka, Tim Hardaway Jr. And Mann. STFU until you stop choking in the playoffs"
"I'd much rather watch Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and some of the douchebag Clippers personalities face the Jazz than Luka Doncic and... Tim Hardaway Jr.? Kristaps ""$150 million traffic cone"" Porzingis? Maxi Kleber?"
"Of course Luka deserves all the praise, but Powell had honestly a great game. Always putting in effort, making the runs. He should get more minutes.   Tim Hardaway Jr. should have gotten more 3s with the great looks he got, hope he can ramp it up for the next game."
"They absolutely need more from Porzingis or they aren’t making a deep run at all, can’t believe Tim Hardaway jr is the second option rn"
Tim Hardaway Jr. was the real prize from that Knicks trade. Tingis Pingus is such ass.
"Key for Dallas to win, Tim Hardaway Jr has to score 20+ points"
"Luka Doncic and Tim Hardaway Jr combine for 62 points, the only players in double figures, as the Los Angeles Mavericks win at ""home"" again."
Tim Hardaway Jr. was the real prize from the Knicks trade.
Jesus Christ Luka Doncic took 37 shots and no one else on the Mavs took more than 10 other than Tim Hardaway Jr
2021 Tim Hardaway Jr- 2005 Jerome James  &amp;#x200B;  balling in the playoffs so he can get overpaid and underwhelm for his new team
Tim Hardaway Jr. being 2-8 from 3s while getting really good looks is horrible.
You mean Tim Hardaway Jr. wasn’t going to outscore PG for the entire series?!  Who would’ve thought?!
Tim Hardaway Jr.'s missed dunk sent a message and inspired Luka
"Tim Hardaway Jr has 4 points.  KP has 2 points.  They need to step up.  Edit: HARDAWAY HIT A 3.  Good work, Tim."
"If not for John Beilein, Caris LeVert would never be in the league today. Duncan Robinson would have never even left D3 and certainly would never be in the league today. Tim Hardaway, Jr. ""might"" not be in the league today, and we have no idea whether or not someone like Jordan Poole would be in the league today.  John Beilein develops talent, period.  Outside of Mitch McGary or *maybe* Glenn Robinson III, nobody he recruited was ever expected to leave early and not spend four years at The University of Michigan.  The entire starting five from the 2013 national title game, in addition to many others, did just that."
Tim Hardaway Jr. or any any shooting wing would be a good fit
"Just 4-5 years ago this team would've killed  C: Rudy Gobert / DeAndre Jordan / Clint Capella / Jusuf Nurkic  PF: Kevin Love / Serge Ibaka / Zach Randolph  SF: Jae Crowder / Tim Hardaway Jr. / Khris Middleton  SG: Klay Thompson / Buddy Hield / Gary Harris  PG: Jrue Holiday / Tony Parker  Love, Holiday, Klay and Gobert were all all star level players in '16-18"
Tim Hardaway Jr. having 2 sub-par games isn't going to cut it if the Mavs want to win.
"CJ McCollum has been bad.  People act like he's our 2nd star but in reality, he's Tim Hardaway Jr(who's actually outplayed him so far)."
Welcome to the Tim Hardaway jr experience
Greatest disappearing acts in history: Tim Hardaway jr and Keebler 👌🏽
I mean you also have to acknowledge Mavericks shooting percentages in the first 2 games  Tim Hardaway jr was moving like Klay
if tim hardaway jr isn’t shooting like klay thompson mavericks could be in trouble
Are you referencing the scrub we got in the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade?
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
Not a bad salary to take on in the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade. The problem was maxing him.
Tim Hardaway Jr. was 0-8 on 2's lol.
You’ve clearly not gotten the memo yet - it’s the “Tim Hardaway Jr trade”.
It will be known as the Tim Hardaway Jr trade now
"I know Porzingis was just an add-in to the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade to match salaries, but man the Mavs needs really need their role players to step up."
imagine how much better the Mavs would be if they hadn't had to take on Porzingis' contract as a part of the Tim Hardaway Jr. trade
tim hardaway jr is the second star
"If he's jealous it'll be Tim Hardaway Jr, he's no where near Luka."
Mavs Role players not named Tim Hardaway Jr aren’t hitting shots and PG and Kawhi not missing any shots
"Tim ""Contract year"" Hardaway Jr. mah boi looks so good and becomes a dumb shit in 1st year of a new contract."
I just want to see Tim Hardaway Jr and Jayson Brown play together.
I mean Tim Hardaway Jr on your team got a 4 yr/71m contract from the Knicks after he averaged 14.5 ppg 45.5% fg on the Hawks.  This season was Kendrick Nunn's 2nd year in the league and he averaged 14.6 ppg 48% fg. I can definitely see some random org signing him for 10-15m/yr. I also see him averaging 17-18 points on a bad team lol
Tim Hardaway Jr
Tim Hardaway Jr is better than both
Ty Lue needs to suite up and guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
"It's going to be really interesting to see how much Tim Hardaway Jr., Norm Powell and Gary Trent Jr. all get this offseason.  Similar sizes &amp; player profiles between all of them, Trent is younger than Norm/THJ but has the least off-the-bounce juice of the trio (plus he's an RFA).  I think all 3 could be getting Jerami Grant $$$ when it comes down to it.  Makes someone like Terrence Ross look like a bargain (he's not as good as any of these 3 but will be making ""only"" $12.5M next year and $11.5M in 22-23)"
What do you think Tim Hardaway Jr is worth. Id assume somewhere where he is currently getting paid if not more
Y’all who is better to have: Tim Hardaway or Gary Trent Jr? Both are free agents
Tim Hardaway Jr. is American
"Curious to know the splits of the clippers as well.   Tim hardaway jr has been hot for the last 3 weeks.   Luka numbers might be a little down just cuz he shot like 0 percent for the first two weeks.  Also hard to say, just let them keep shooting open jumpers, they will eventually miss. It’s time for the clippers and all the first team defense players to start playing like it."
&gt;Dorian Finney-Smith on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s throwing the ball into the hoop from far  I think it's on you instead of OP to realize you're in an NBA sub lol
Tim Hardaway Jr is underrated.   He is surprisingly good. Averaged nearly identical stats with the Mavericks with 16/3/2 in back to back years.   He does this while being a great 3 point shooter/floor spacer capable of creating his own shot. This year he was 8th in total 3’s and 15th in 3’s per game while shooting 39+% from deep.
"Tim Hardaway Jr is a stud too. I think the series would be close with Utah taking it. But losing to whoever comes out of the Suns/Lakers. (I know they'll go through Denver or Portland first but, cmon now LOL)"
"This the same fanbase that told everyone Landry Fields, Tim Hardaway Jr, Iman Shumpert, Anthony Randolph, etc etc would be future stars"
6. Tim hardaway jr vs the rockets or when his parents are attending
Tim Hardaway Jr is also tearing the Clips a new one
Can't beat contract year Tim Hardaway Jr.
"Your guess is as good as mine, [according to RAPTOR/538 potentially better than this year.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nba-player-projections/tim-hardaway-jr/)"
"Honestly I've been a Tim Hardaway Jr. fan since I've seen him on the Hawks and I didn't understand why they traded him. He is a really great shooter and the last 2 games in these Playoffs he's been on fire. I feel like he's being slept on a lot, or am I wrong about that? Anyway, I am happy for the Mavs and at the same time sad for Kawhi, he left the Championship Raptors behind to try to make the CLIPPERS(!) great, which I don't think anyone expected. Also, why is Cousins not playing?"
"As someone who has watched a lot of Michigan basketball on the college side, I just love seeing any of John Beilein's players playing well in the NBA.  Tim Hardaway Jr was a 3-star recruit out of high school, I don't think most people saw him as a starter on a playoff team and contributing this much."
ehh As someone who has watched Tim Hardaway Jr on two different stints with the knicks he is wildly inconsistent. I guess it depends what type of role you are asking him to fill.
Paul George being outplayed by Tim Hardaway jr through the first two games is a massive problem
"Awesome! Feels good to be a spectator right now, no stress and I can watch some good games.   Nice shot Tim Hardaway Jr."
"u underestimate the power of role players.  if they can find solid role players like tim hardaway jr type people, hell ya.  PG is a good player but he’s not a team player no is he great anymore as he gets older.  they will dump him like blake for solid pieces  blake fetched tobias harris , boban, avery, and picks — u don’t think clippers won that trade in the end?  clippers just need to find a desperate team (kings) willing to part pieces like Fox and some role players for PG lol  teams desperate want superstars to fill seats and PG can still fill seats"
Tim Hardaway Jr. actually showed effort for the first time in years
the mavs are shooting crazy from 3. luka is easily the best player in the series and the clippers have no amswer for him. the clippers role players are not playjng that well and tim hardaway jr us by far the best non-star player in the 1st 2 games
They have to go through Tim Hardaway Jr first.
"Who is better? I’d rather have Luka than lebron from what I’m seeing. Imagine Luka on LA.  Tim Hardaway jr, lebron, dorian finney smith, porzingis, and josh Richardson don’t scare anybody."
Luka Doncic and Tim Hardaway jr are the real new MJ and Pippen that’s how
"Look Clippers aren't playing bad at all, Mavericks are really just clicking making a lot of shots. Players are stepping up especially someone like Tim Hardaway Jr dropping 20 something tonight. Don't go for the clippers head on them being bad; Mavericks are just on one right now."
Tim Hardaway Jr. actually gave a shit
Tim hardaway jr is definitely getting paid this summer. If he keeps playing like this and develops the rest of his game he can be a potential all star next season. He's been great this season.
What the fuck is this comment lol. Porzingis? Tim Hardaway JR was the best 6th man in the league this year? Jalen Brunson is another great piece. They have a solid ass team idk why that’s hard for this sub to accept
Tim Hardaway Jr!!!!!!!!
Tim Hardaway Jr at one point looked like the worst contract in the league a few years ago and now he's looking like he'll ink another 20mil a year contract. Crazy.
I LOVE YOU TIM HARDAWAY JR  THANK YOU KNICKS  THANK YOU VLAD DIVAC
Tim Hardaway Jr. has the smoothest jumper in the league. No one can change my mind.
TIM HARDAWAY JR
Tim Hardaway Jr. what a game!!!
Tim Hardaway Jr morphs into a max player in the playoffs.
look at tim hardaway jr man
Was Tim Hardaway Jr the best player in that Knick's trade?
"If you add Steph curry , klay Thompson and ray allen jumpers , you will get tim hardaway jr every time he is playing us i swear"
Tim Hardaway Jr. is basically putting up the same stats as Clarkson on way better efficiency
"I don't believe in it either in most cases. As a Pistons fan I hear it all the time with regards to Jerami Grant, but I didn't know what other term to use. However, there are some guys who really do put up empty stats (Drummond, Morris on the Knicks, Tim Hardaway Jr on the Knicks)"
"Luka calling Tim Hardaway Jr. ""a pretty special kid for us"" is pretty amusing."
Brunson and Tim hardaway Jr stepped up . So fun watching them cut the clippers defense up
I’m happy for Tim Hardaway JR I miss him
holy shit have i have been sleepin on tim hardaway jr
holy shit i have been sleepin on tim hardaway jr
The Mavericks got Tim Hardaway Jr. for Dennis Smith!! What a genius trade!
Hey guys can anyone help me find which shoes markeiff morris and Tim hardaway Jr are wearing?
Bad awareness by Tim Hardaway Jr letting Batum switch on the Zinger
"Imagine if Luka had a true ""Robin to his Batman""?  Porzingis &amp; Tim Hardaway Jr aint it."
Clipper fans thought they can take on Lebron and AD when they can’t even handle Tim Hardaway Jr and Luka 😂😂😂😂😂
"To answer your first question about positions it’s changed a lot in the past 5-10 years.    In the past generally speaking, the point guard would typically bring the ball up the court and set up his teammates to score, and would be more pass first type of players.  I’m not sure when exactly this changed but Gilbert Arenas in the early 00s became the prototype for the modern scoring guard like Kyrie and Curry.    Shooting guards would be bigger and taller than point guards and would have more of a scoring responsibility along with being secondary ball handlers.  Think guys like Tim Hardaway Jr.    Small forwards are even bigger, can usually still score but a lot of times in the past were on the court solely for defense.  Good examples of this were Ron Artest and Bruce Bowen.  Today’s NBA has phased out these defensive specialists and now everyone on the court needs to be able to shoot or drive to a certain extent.    As for power forwards and centers, they were the most important position on the court for decades until about 10-15 years ago.  In the past the big men would be the premier two way players and would handle the teams offensive load while still being shot blockers and rebounding.  Hakeem and Tim Duncan are the two goats at their respective positions.  I didn’t mean for this to be so long but I’m tryna help a newer fan out, everything I said above has changed pretty drastically now and is more of a history lesson.  Today, the positions have morphed into each other and are looked at more by ball handlers, wing, and big man.  Everyone on the court needs to be able to score at a high level with the ball in their hands now and defensive liabilities are easily exposed.  We probably won’t see another Isaiah Thomas, who’s 5’9” and has fallen off of a cliff in the last 5 years.  Basketball is a very addictive sport and I highly recommend looking into the history of it, the late 00s are the easiest games to digest because the quality of video is still good but everything seems much much different.  Hope I helped brotha"
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"
"Not sure if it's been pointed out, but someone mentioned Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway Jr. as a fun one, but putting them in tells me ""Player Not Found"". Swapped them and same thing."
"No Tim Hardaway Jr, Or Brunson? Damn."
Tim Hardaway Sr. and Tim Hardaway Jr. both played with Dirk.
Tim Hardaway Jr. ?
"huh, Dirk Played with Tim Hardaway, and Tim Hardaway Jr."
Metta world peace was teammates with Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway jr
Tim Hardaway Jr deserves it more tbh. Put up better numbers than Rose and played 20 more games. More efficient and better defense than Clarkson as well.
9 between Desmond Bane and Art Hillhouse  1 between Tim Hardaway and Tim Hardaway Jr. (through Metta World Peace)
Well no shit. So your argument is Carlisle isn’t a top coach because we would be a bottom team with Porzingis (if he’s even playing) and Tim Hardaway Jr. as our best players? In the Western Conference no less? Lol
"Tim Hardaway and Tim hardaway jr (connection is dirk)! I thought I found it when I connected Klay with his dad, but turns out I was spelling his name wrong :/"
DeMar in the Tim Hardaway Jr role will be so good. But I think he'll be going to a contender for a discount.
"[ESPN] Tim Hardaway Jr. on Luka Doncic: ""He's taking stupid shots."""
This is from the new Old Man and the Three (JJ's podcast) episode with Tim Hardaway Jr which was really good and I thought this moment was funny so I posted it here.
I’m pretty sure Marc Albert isn’t even aware of Dorian Finney-Smith’s existence. Gets called Tim Hardaway Jr every single time🤦🏼‍♂️
"Don't expansion teams automatically get the top pick in the draft? Like Seattle gets #1, Vegas gets #2, then Vegas picks first from the player pool?   If you're Seattle and you go in knowing you have Cade, that changes things dramatically. I also think you focus on free agency (you have crazy money to work with, starting from scratch) and use the expansion draft to round it out.   I'd get Cade, then pursue solid guys in free agency who I know are probably going to go for the bag, or young guys you could overpay and gamble on. Guys like Otto Porter Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Cody Zeller, Doug McDermott, Lauri Markkanen, Malik Monk.   Then in the expansion draft add Winslow, Thompson, Okogie, Okpala, Holiday, Arcidiacono  Cade/Payton/Arcidiacono  Monk/A. Holiday/Okogie  Hardaway/Porter/Winslow  Markkanen/McDermott/Melli  Zeller/Thompson/Okpala  I think this team has a good balance of young guys and vets, it makes up for a lack of star power with depth, it'll be about as competitive as an expansion team can be.  Good spacing, good size, nobody too old."
1. Luka   2. KP   3. Jalen Brunson   4. Tim Hardaway Jr.   5. Dorian Finney-Smith   6. Maxi Kleber   7. Dwight Powell  8. Josh Green
"Jrich has been just fine, tim hardaway jr. had a breakout season, brunson is healthy and things are looking alright with porzingis.     Like these seem minor to your fanbase, but Tim and Brunson are crucial pieces of Rick Carlisle’s gameplan. If Rick has a workable first team and an elite bench squad, he can win any series. See the 2014 first round series against Spurs. SBNation has done a nice feature on it."
"First of all, Bronnys not exactly a scrub. He was dunking as a freshman in highschool and looks pretty damn athletic. What about Steph Curry? Might help that his dad was one of the better shooters ever. Tim Hardaway Jr. isn't a scrub either. Shaq's son isn't exactly normal sized. Genetics work exactly like that. Of course, the individual having drive to want that matters a lot, but in the specific case mentioned, a kid growing up in a house with a mom that's got gold medals and world cups, and a dad that's regarded as one of the best defenders and two way players in the NBA, I'd say those kids have a pretty DAMN good chance of being in whatever league they prefer."
Gonna be hard for ingles to Jingle pg when he’s going against Tim hardaway jr. in the second round.
Do this with Tim Hardaway Jr. and Rockets jerseys as well.
"&gt;I have always tried to remain at least semi-realistic with positions as long as the league is using positional designations. Embiid is a pure center. Doncic is more amorphous. He acts as the Mavs' point guard, which is why most voters start by considering him at guard; but by that logic, James -- listed at forward most of his career -- has been a ""guard"" all along. (The league made James eligible at guard last season, and again this time.)  &gt;Seven of the Mavs' eight most-used lineups featuring Doncic match him with two of Tim Hardaway Jr., Josh Richardson, and Jalen Brunson. What position is Doncic in those groups? On offense, Doncic is at least as much ""point forward"" as ""point guard."" He defends both guards and forwards -- whatever is convenient night-to-night."
